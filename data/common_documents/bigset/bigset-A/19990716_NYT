CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE WITH KC SCHOOL CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Kansas City Board of Education continued to negotiate
Thursday with superintendent candidate Benjamin Demps Jr. on an
annual contract that could pay him as much as $200,000, including
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Board members are scheduled to meet at 6 p.m. Friday to vote on
a final agreement. If it is approved, Demps would travel to Kansas
City to sign the deal.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the district spent much of Thursday exchanging
proposals by telephone with Demps, who lives in Oklahoma City. He
is a retired Federal Aviation Administration official who served as
director of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services in the early
1990s. He is now semiretired and operates an aviation consulting
business.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they were not sure when he would start work.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his home Thursday afternoon, Demps, 65, said he was
pleased to receive the offer but added: ``This is the ticklish
part. I've got to take it one step at time. I hope things go well.
Maybe I'll get to Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   Demps would be the 19th interim or full-time superintendent in
30 years. He is the third person to be offered the job in the last
three weeks. The school board voted 7-2 late Wednesday to make the
offer.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, board member Lance Loewenstein disputed a statement
by board member Fifi Wiedeman that the majority of board members
voted for Demps because they were ``more concerned about being
removed from power than doing what is best for this district.''
</P>
<P>
   The school board is under orders from U.S. District Judge Dean
Whipple to reach agreement with a finalist by Monday. If it
doesn't, the court-appointed Desegregation Monitoring Committee
wants to appoint an interim superintendent while the school board
continues the search. The interim superintendent would report to
the committee, not the school board.
</P>
<P>
   Loewenstein said he thought the committee's proposal had little
effect on the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was the only one who was afraid of the DMC's idea,''
Loewenstein said. ``I viewed the DMC's letter as nothing short of
receivership.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said any doubts he and others had about Demps were
relieved by positive reports from Oklahoma. Four board members
traveled there Wednesday to interview Demps' associates and former
co-workers at the Department of Human Services. They also met with
lawmakers, the administrator overseeing the state employees'
personnel office and representatives of several minority groups. In
addition, they met with the publisher of a minority-owned
newspaper, The Ebony Tribune, an Oklahoma City Board of Education
member and others.
</P>
<P>
   Most praised Demps' strong leadership and management skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this guy could have been hired without the deadline,''
Loewenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Sandy Mayer, who made the trip with Lee Barnes Jr.,
Connie Clark and Helen Ragsdale, said she was pleased to learn that
Demps had a strong record for promoting women within the Department
of Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good-old-boy network, and that was a very hard thing
for him to do _ to move the incompetent males out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said most of those he interviewed called Demps an
effective administrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he has clear goals and objectives from the board, he can
carry out those goals,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes also inquired about comments by the president of the
Oklahoma City NAACP, who criticized Demps in a television interview
as being uninvolved in minority affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Demps told Barnes that he did not have much personal involvement
with the NAACP but supported its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes noted that the NAACP official is an employee of the
Department of Human Services, which Barnes said could have been a
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Other department employees told Barnes that Demps was ``as
aggressive as he could be on affirmative action in a merit
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he initially was concerned that Demps got most of
his management experience in large bureaucracies and in positions
that limited his contact with the public. The visit changed his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more than willing to listen to those groups to see how
things affect their community,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike some other finalists, Demps was not being promoted
from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not an inclination to like this guy,'' Loewenstein
said. ``He was nobody's favorite. I think that indicates the
strength of his candidacy _ the fact that he came in not being
anyone's golden child and turned out to be the golden child. That
is the magic of this process. I really think we got the right
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   District officials are negotiating a salary package worth about
$200,000. The amount is similar to that received by the previous
superintendent, Henry Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The package would include Demps' car allowance and insurance and
annuity premium payments. In addition, board members are requesting
that part of the package be tied to performance in certain areas.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are his ability to improve teacher training, testing
and evaluation of students and accountability of students, teachers
and administrators. Many of those programs are a year behind
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Demps is being asked to review all of the
district's programs and services, quickly overhaul the Human
Resources Department and develop plans for employee recruitment,
evaluation and training.
</P>
<P>
   He will be expected to increase student attendance and reading
ability and reduce the dropout rate.
</P>
<P>
   He also could get more money by increasing the percentage of
students taking college placement tests and college-level courses.
</P>
<P>
   Some district patrons are skeptical that Demps' management
skills can work at an urban public school district. They question
whether a non-educator can tackle the job, given that improving the
academic performance of Kansas City district students remains the
top priority for the next leader.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes dismissed those complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understood that when we began talking to nontraditional
candidates.''

MOTHERHOOD INSPIRING FOR QUANCE-JULIAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the starting blocks, swimmer Kristine
Quance-Julian is the same as she ever was. The way she stares at
the still water, it's a wonder the whole pool doesn't start
bubbling.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the intensity Quance-Julian brings to her
swimming boiled over into other areas of her life. A bad workout
could agitate her for hours; a poor meet would leave her seething
for days.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Dec. 9 she had her first child, Trenton. Seven months
later, all the physical changes that her pregnancy wrought have
vanished. The extra 55 pounds are gone, leaving the same swimmer
but a noticeably different person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this renewed drive and I have a little boy, too,'' said
Quance-Julian, a 1996 Olympian who is one of the featured
competitors this weekend at the Janet Evans Invitational at USC.
``He is so much fun. He makes me forget all the stupid little
things I used to obsess about.''
</P>
<P>
   The old worries _ of beating her Chinese counterparts, of
meeting her own imperial standards _ have given way to graver
concerns. Trenton, a bouncy, babbling baby, has been slow to use
his arms and at seven months already is a veteran of physical
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Their baby's hardships have given Quance-Julian and her husband,
Jeff, also a former world-class swimmer, a new appreciation for
their own bountiful physical gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Trenton is a trooper; it's Quance-Julian who seems to be
suffering. The former Granada Hills High standout has a guilt
attack every time she returns from swim practice and Jeff has gone
with Trenton to his therapy sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel like I'm such a bad parent,'' said
Quance-Julian, who looked nothing of the sort on this fine day as
she cooed at her gurgling son and enticed him with one of his plush
toys.
</P>
<P>
   In a little while, she and Trenton would be settling in for
their afternoon nap. That's part of the pact Quance-Julian and her
husband made after the baby's birth. For the next 14 months,
through the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Quance-Julian's full-time job
is to concentrate on making her second Olympic team and winning the
individual gold medal that eluded her in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff quit his full-time gig as a financial planner in May
because the long and inflexible hours needed to set his clients up
with long-term peace of mind were threatening Trenton's short-term
security.
</P>
<P>
   So Jeff became Mr. Mom and Quance-Julian, I.M. Mama.
</P>
<P>
   Another Olympian, Angel Martino, has resumed her career after
giving birth. The difference is, she's a sprinter. Quance-Julian
excels in events such as the 400-meter individual medley and
200-meter butterfly that require easily twice the fortitude.
</P>
<P>
   No U.S. woman has made an Olympic swimming team in an event
longer than 100 meters after having a baby. If anybody is capable
of pulling it off, it's Quance-Julian, whom her coach at Trojan
Swim Club, Mark Schubert, describes as ``a compulsive
perfectionist.''
</P>
<P>
   It can be exhausting, aiming so high. Quance-Julian admits she
started mentally straying from her target after finishing far
behind two Chinese swimmers in the 400 I.M. at last year's World
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pregnancy looks like the best thing that could have
happened to her,'' Jeff said. ``It forced her to take a step back
and she realized she loved the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Quance-Julian hadn't taken a break from racing in a decade, not
since she made her first senior-nationals standard at the age of
15. So it startled her almost as much as that first contraction
would when, confined to a bed in the last month of her pregnancy,
she actually started to crave the 400 I.M. as though it were some
pickle-and-pistachio-ice-cream combination.
</P>
<P>
   Understand: As far as combinations go, there are few less
appetizing than a brisk 100 meters each of butterfly, backstroke,
breaststroke and freestyle. Heartburn has nothing on the lung-burn
and limb-burn that settles in around the 300-meter mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize how much I missed racing,'' said
Quance-Julian, who has done well in the handful of meets she has
entered since May.
</P>
<P>
   She already has posted an unshaved, unrested time of 4 minutes,
52 seconds in the 400 meter I.M. If she can shave off another
second per lap at next month's nationals in Minneapolis, she'll
likely represent the U.S. at the Pan Pacific Games. They will be
held at the Olympic pool in Sydney in August.
</P>
<P>
   It matters less to Schubert how Quance-Julian swims this summer
than next. But for Quance-Julian, making the Pan Pacific team
matters a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say that's not my goal, even though my coaches say
it's no big deal,'' Quance-Julian said. ``I want to make (the team)
because I know there are plenty of people who think I'm stupid for
trying to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth? Probably the only one who thinks Quance-Julian has
something left to prove is . . . Quance-Julian.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the way she's wired,'' Schubert said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   A live cord dropped into the water _ that's Quance-Julian all
right. She's electrifying.

ADDS TIME OF ACCIDENT  
 FREAK NATURE OF YOUNG OFFICER'S DEATH STUNS DEPARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REBEKAH DENN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERETT, Wash. _ The rituals are unfamiliar at the somber police
department offices here: The flag at half-staff for one of their
own, the bagpipers preparing to pay tribute to a fallen officer,
the counselors trying to ease the pain of a colleague's death.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Brian M. Dibucci, who suffered a fatal fall after a high
speed chase Thursday, was the first person to die in the line of
duty in the Everett department in 79 years.
</P>
<P>
   The freak nature of his death _ falling 100 feet from a trestle
as he tried to assist his fellow officers _ made the shock even
worse, said Deputy Chief Pat Slack. Police are conscious that they
risk their lives every day, Slack said, but they fear shootings or
stabbings _ ``not something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   With Dibucci's death, the department lost a man who had ``a
wonderful future to look forward to,'' Chief Jim Scharf said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Dibucci considered an up-and-coming patrolman, but
he had just announced his engagement to Margaret Erb, a fellow
Everett officer. The couple, who started dating shortly after
Dibucci joined the department in January of 1998, was planning a
February wedding.
</P>
<P>
   After Dibucci and Erb were to finish working their 5 p.m. to 5
a.m. shift Thursday, they had planned to visit Erb's mother and let
her know the good news.
</P>
<P>
   They were a ``wonderful'' couple, said Dibucci's stepfather,
Thurston County Commissioner Kevin O'Sullivan, who had welcomed
their engagement along with Dibucci's mother, Donna O'Sullivan.
``They loved each other with sincerity and passion.''
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the car involved in the traffic stop is being
investigated for suspicion of second-degree murder, possession of
stolen property _ the car was stolen _ and felony eluding. A
district court judge Thursday set his bail at $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors couldn't be immediately reached Thursday, but
Woodall said he expected they would file murder charges against the
driver rather than a lesser charge such as manslaughter. He said
the man was not being treated any more harshly because an officer
had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elements are very clear on murder two,'' Woodall said.
``He committed a felony, and someone died as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   Dibucci's stepfather, himself a former police officer, said he
considered murder charges ``absolutely appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dibucci was a backup policeman in Thursday's pursuit, one of at
least three officers chasing a driver who had tried to outrun
police after he was spotted driving erratically around 3:15 a.m.
The pursuit proceeded from the downtown streets to the trestle on
state Route 2 heading out of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Officers had slowed as they approached a sharp S-curve at the
east end of the trestle, Woodall said, but the driver sped on, lost
control, and crashed. The officers ran to the car, guns drawn, and
arrested the unharmed man and his passenger.
</P>
<P>
   The case seemed to be closed.
</P>
<P>
   Then they noticed the empty patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   The officers tried to raise Dibucci on his radio, then saw that
he had fallen over the thigh-high barrier to the grass and brush
100 feet below.
</P>
<P>
   The road split into three ramps at that spot of the accident,
and Dibucci had parked at an adjacent overpass about 15 feet from
the stolen car.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still trying to figure out what happened.
Everett police said Dibucci was apparently trying to cover the
other officers as they made the arrest, and likely either slipped
or leaned too far as he rushed from his car to the barrier.
</P>
<P>
   The Snohomish County Medical Examiner's Office ruled the death
an accident.
</P>
<P>
   For Dibucci's stepfather, the way Dibucci died was in line with
the way he served his community every day. ``He fell to his death
running to help another officer,'' O'Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Dibucci, 30, was ``a great kid,'' said Scharf, sad and weary as
he spoke in the same office where he had interviewed the young man
with glowing references a year and a half before.
</P>
<P>
   Smart, dedicated, professional and compassionate, Dibucci had
wanted to be a police officer from the time he was a boy, family
and friends said.
</P>
<P>
   He was inspired by the example set by his stepfather, who was
the latest in a family line of police officers, and by the
opportunity to serve the public.
</P>
<P>
   Dibucci saw ``the excitement of being on the road, being a part
of the community, seeing what you can do as an individual to
improve the community,'' said former Tenino (Wash.) Police Chief
Derek Stansbury, who worked with Dibucci as a 911 dispatcher in
Thurston County and recruited him as a Tenino officer in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the biggest smile and just the biggest heart ... I
don't think I've ever seen Brian have a harsh word for anybody,
ever,'' said dispatcher Gay Nell Bare.
</P>
<P>
   At Tenino ``his mind was always going 120 miles an hour,''
Stansbury said, establishing an especially close rapport with
children, starting up a bicycle cop patrol, and always thinking
about how to improve the department.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his mother and stepfather, of West Olympia, Dibucci is
survived by his father, John Dibucci of Pennsylvania, and his
grandmother, Mary Hill of Lacey.
</P>
<P>
   The last time an Everett officer died was in 1920, when
Detective John Fox was shot by a robber.

NOTHING WAS GOING TO STOP FIRST FAN INTO SAFECO FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELLIS E. CONKLIN AND ALAN SNEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ They came ready to fall in love and few were
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   On a mild summer evening, Safeco Field was flooded with
superlatives from a legion of fans. Words such as beautiful,
outstanding and unbelievable floated in the light breeze.
</P>
<P>
   The new ballyard's first fan surged into the glistening
turnstile at 4 p.m., three hours before the first pitch. When the
turnstile arm wouldn't budge, Joe Cox, 50, of West Seattle, scooted
around the metal contraption and joyfully skipped up stairs to the
main concourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incredible. I can't wait to get a look at that concourse,''
screamed Cox, who had camped overnight outside the ballpark to be
the first one in.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen fans, including his daughter, Christina Roeun, and
son-in- law, Vu Roeun, hugged him and traded high-fives.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after elated mobs of smiling fans poured into the
palatial, 47,000-seat venue, Cox sat in section 333, row 24 _ one
row down from the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turnstile didn't turn, so I thought I was pretty adept at
zipping around it. Nothing was going to stop me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clear across the stadium, in section 313 above the right field
wall, the Gill family could not see the warning track below, but
Donnie Gill, 28, of Tacoma, soaked up a vista of a ship being
unloaded in Seattle's port.
</P>
<P>
   Gill said the venue was worth every penny of the $517 million it
cost to build, including $100 million of costs unanticipated when
the construction budget was set in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be any cheaper than it is now,'' Gill said.
``We deserved it. We've been good baseball fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocky Ruddy of Seattle breathed in the spectacle from the swanky
club level.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like something no one has ever seen before in
Seattle,'' Ruddy said. ``This is great. Outside baseball at last.''
</P>
<P>
   Paddy Freeman, whose father-in-law, Stan Golub, was an original
Mariners owner, was all smiles as he posed for pictures with his
family atop the third-base dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is wonderful,'' Freeman exclaimed. ``This is going to be
a great home for baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Up in the high expanses of deep left field that is section 346,
Jim Rhynard sat happily with his wife, Kathy, and thought back to
Seattle baseball of decades past.
</P>
<P>
   ``This brings back memories of Sicks' Stadium when I was a kid
in the '50s _ the fresh air, the grass _ everything,'' Rhynard
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of happy mayhem, there were glitches:
</P>
<P>
   A brief pre-game power outage knocked out upper-level concession
stand cash registers, but that didn't stop buddies Brian Land and
Doug Jones, both of Everett, from quaffing some cold suds, munching
fresh-grilled hot dogs and sponging up diesel fumes wafting up from
a freight train rumbling below.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind a little diesel fuel. It's part of the
ambience,'' said Land, a 20-game season ticketholder.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate the nautical theme _ the wheels that move the roof
are shaped like ship's wheels _ hundreds of sailors stood ready to
launch blue-and-white confetti into the crowd that packed the
stadium by 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Mercedes-Benz of stadiums,'' said usher John
Zuberbuhler of Kent.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is happy with the Benz price. Outside the
stadium, protesters waved signs critical of the Mariners for asking
for another $60 million in public money to help pay off extra
construction costs.
</P>
<P>
   Tim McDonnell of Seattle stood at the left-field entrance with
his hand-drawn sign that read ``Never have so many been taxed to
enrich so few.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a few people come by and say that it's a good sign
and it had a good message,'' McDonnell said. ``Then there've been
some people who got liquored-up at the local bars and have flipped
me the bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, as if to prove that point, Cliff, a 38-year-old
metal worker and fan, confronted a man carrying a sign that read
``$372 M is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think this is?'' Cliff berated the man. ``This is
the free enterprise system. Public governments and private industry
need to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the protesters, a rarity: Someone
believed the Mariners deserved to have the county pay for the cost
overruns.
</P>
<P>
   Vic White of Grants Pass, Ore., was paid by ``People for a Fun
City,'' to come up to Safeco and circulate petitions asking the
county to pay more. His sign read ``Junior, A-Rod and (team
Chairman John) Ellis deserve a raise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big fan of the Mariners, and I think they should stay

COMMENTARY: WHITEWASH AT JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 10th graf to clarify) (mk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The most dramatic clash between the FBI and the
heavily politicized Reno Department of Justice took place in
February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Stimulated by press reports of ``the Asian connection'' to the
Clinton-Gore campaign, the bureau teletyped all field offices for
reports on foreign attempts to influence U.S. political campaigns.
On Washington's Birthday the FBI's counterintelligence chief, John
Lewis, delivered a packet of those top-secret reports to Janet
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general gave the packet of teletypes to then
Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick,'' reports Michael Bromwich,
the in-house inspector general. At the same time, White House
counsel Charles Ruff made two calls to Justice seeking to find out
what embarrassment was in store.
</P>
<P>
   Never told by Reno of FBI restrictions on the documents, Ms.
Gorelick bucked them to the Office of Intelligence Policy and
Review. They then blithely passed them on to Laura Ingersoll's
Justice ``task force,'' selected for its ineptitude.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing doing, said the FBI, which ``retrieved the packet
shortly after the task force received it,'' according to Bromwich.
When I asked the FBI director, Louis Freeh, on Thursday if he had
been aware of the confrontation _ an unprecedented dispatch of
agents to snatch back evidence from Main Justice _ he replied, ``I
knew about it and certainly approved of it.''
</P>
<P>
   What was going on? The FBI, though slow off the mark and unaware
of all the leads it had in its computers, was getting evidence of
China's efforts to penetrate our political system. Ruff's calls
show that the Clinton White House hungered for it. Justice was
passing the surveillance of messages to Ted Sieong and Maria Hsia _
both in direct contact with Al Gore in his fund raising _ all over
the building.
</P>
<P>
   And so the FBI acted to prevent contacts with the White House
officials under investigation, to avoid the sort of improper
``heads up'' given them in Whitewater. The FBI meekly genuflected
when Reno's lapdog IG chastised it for cooperating too much with
Congress rather than Main Justice, but Freeh says grimly ``None of
that changes my resolve to limit dissemination that would undermine
the integrity of a criminal investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The name-no-names whitewash by Reno's IG admits that Congress
was not given two pieces of espionage information it should have
had until September 1997 _ after the Senate investigators had all
but closed shop and Democrats happily declared the Asian
penetration unproven.
</P>
<P>
   Bromwich's 569-page report dumping on the FBI and claiming
innocent ineptitude on high is stamped ``top secret'' because it
might jeopardize an ongoing failure at Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The two of its deep, dark secrets mentioned above are covered in
Elizabeth Drew's new book that has a chapter about the successful
obstruction of the Thompson committee investigation, ``The
Corruption of American Politics.''
</P>
<P>
   One is the Hong Kong source of the $400,000 contribution of
Indonesia's Sieong, most of it routed to the Democratic National
Committee through his resident alien daughter. He was seated next
to Al Gore during Maria Hsia's Buddhist fund-raiser, and his money
was never returned by the Democrats; because money is fungible,
China's contribution will buy spots in Campaign 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Another secret was sent the committee only after its hearings
were over. It alleged that Ms. Hsia had recruited someone in
California's state government to be ``an agent'' for China. In the
Bromwich sandwich, eight more bits of intelligence information
concealed from congressional oversight are deliciously embedded,
but not for the public to see until after the next election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to me,'' says Fred Thompson, ``that people at high
levels of Justice and the bureau had access to significant
information very early on. We need to find out what was held back
and why. Was it rank incompetence, as in the Department of Energy,
or was it a deliberate holding back at Justice for political
purposes?''
</P>
<P>
   Here was a dangerous triple failure. First our
counterintelligence failed to take seriously the
fund-raising-espionage connections. Then our Justice prosecutors
failed, letting middle-level perpetrators walk lest they lead to
higher-ups. Finally, our congressional oversight failed, obstructed
by partisans who put party ahead of country.

RANGERS WIN WITH 3 RUNS IN NINTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ None of the Rangers' three left-handed
hitters started last night's game with Arizona's Randy Johnson on
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the trio helped finish it.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer, Rafael Palmeiro and Lee Stevens drew three
consecutive two-out walks as ninth-inning pinch hitters against
Arizona closer Matt Mantei, and that set the stage for Mark
McLemore's game-winning, bases-clearing double that catapulted the
Rangers to a stirring, 3-2 victory at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore, a switch hitter, lined a 2-2 pitch into the gap in
right-center field. Right fielder Tony Womack could only knock down
the drive, and Stevens chugged home from first base with the
winning run on the game's final play.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respects to the young man, and I know they
brought him over here to close,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said
of Mantei, ``but any time Randy Johnson leaves the game and I can
get my left-handed hitters into the game ... well, it worked out
well for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mantei, whom the Diamondbacks acquired July 9 in a four-player
trade with the Florida Marlins, replaced Johnson after the
intimidating left-hander pitched eight scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mantei (1-3) retired third baseman Todd Zeile and center fielder
Ruben Mateo before Oates sent Greer to the plate for shortstop
Royce Clayton. Greer worked the count full before drawing a walk,
and Palmeiro _ who pinch hit for second baseman Luis Alicea _
followed by drawing a walk on a 3-1 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   That brought Stevens to the plate for first baseman Jon Shave,
and that produced a classic, 10-pitch battle with Mantei. Stevens
fouled three consecutive 1-2 pitches before working the count full
and fouled a 3-2 offering before drawing the Rangers' third
consecutive two-out walk. With the three consecutive pinch-hit
walks, the Rangers did something that had been accomplished only
seven other times in major-league history.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore's at-bat produced the Rangers' third two-strike,
two-out plate appearance, but Mantei could not slam the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``One like that makes even me smile,'' Oates said. ``You know
you're going up against Randy. Now, I really don't believe in it,
but I thought he was due for a win _ and it looked like he was
going to win one. It looked liked the two runs were going to stand
up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson entered last night's appearance with a five-game losing
streak despite surrendering only five earned runs and accumulating
54 strikeouts during a span of 32 innings in his previous four
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Johnson suffered the loss during each of those games while
the Diamondbacks failed to score en route to being no-hit, one-hit,
two-hit and three-hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we can score on anybody,'' Rangers starter Rick
Helling said. ``Mantei is a great closer, and he can do the job,
but we just had good at-bats, which is the most important in that
situation. That was the impressive thing tonight. We made hteir
pitcher work an honest inning.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared for eight innings that Helling would borrow a page
from Johnson's tough-luck manual for starting pitchers. A
first-inning walk to right fielder Tony Womack and an eighth-inning
curveball to second baseman Jay Bell would be enough to condemn
Helling to the type of loss Johnson understands all too well.
</P>
<P>
   A first-inning single by third baseman Matt Williams and Bell's
eighth-inning home run produced the evening's only runs in a
pitchers' duel until the Rangers' bottom-of-the-ninth heroics.
</P>
<P>
   Helling did not figure in the decision despite allowing only two
runs on five hits and three walks during his eight-inning,
117-pitch appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a great lineup, a typical American league
lineup,'' Helling said. ``When you face Randy, you just want to
keep it close. I was able to do that. I was just happy to keep us
in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, left-hander Mike Venafro (3-1) earned the victory by
pitching a scoreless ninth inning and then witnessing the
improbable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was as an exciting win as we've had all season,'' Oates
said. ``We beat a good pitcher even though he was in the dugout
when the game ended.''

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ On the 12th hole Thursday at Carnoustie,
young Sergio Garcia made two trips into the scruffy patches of
gorse. The first was to hit a wayward shot.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The second was either to curse loud enough and not draw
attention or to do what sometimes must be done during four or five
hours on the golf course. Either way, he summed up the feelings of
all players about the place that lived up to its nickname of
Carnasty during the opening round of the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody broke par, but a few players broke down during a cool,
windy day along the Scottish seaside. The average score was 78.312.
More than a third of the field _ 57 players _ failed to break 80,
and two shot in the 90s as the wind blew at 30 mph for much of the
day with gusts higher and lulls that only served to tease and
confuse the players. There was a who's who of swatters thrilled to
escape the opening round with rounds of 74, 75 or even 77.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time in any round of a major championship that
nobody has broken par since the British Open in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take my 74 and run,'' Colin Montgomerie said. ``I'll take
three more of them, too. That would be plus-12 (for the
tournament). It sounds crazy to say that. (But) that could be the
winning score. As long as you're one less than the rest of them, it
doesn't matter how many over par you are.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the battle cry as players will put on their full metal
jackets for the rest of this survival test. Many players got ahead
of par briefly early in their rounds. But none could sustain it.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, little-known Rodney Pampling, an Australian, was
the best at coping with the bad conditions, shooting even-par 71 to
lead by a stroke over Germany's Bernhard Langer and American Scott
Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's been a thrill so far,'' Pampling said. ``It's
a tough course to get there (on the greens). But once you get
there, you can save a bit if you're putting well.''
</P>
<P>
   Pampling had nine putts through eight holes and finished with
only 25, which was a big reason he wasn't suffering the fate of
most players Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a day for the marquee players not to shoot
themselves out of the tournament. Montgomerie's 3-over total was
matched by Ernie Els. Hal Sutton shot 73, as did Justin Leonard.
Tiger Woods (74), Lee Westwood (76), Greg Norman (76), Darren
Clarke (76), Vijay Singh (77) and Nick Price (77) all were happy to
take a limited number of lumps and get off the course.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, Montgomerie said, things could get worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can blow worse than this, that's for sure,'' he said.
``This was a breezy summer's day here. Nothing more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not exactly what befuddled players like Garcia, Mark
O'Meara, Lee Janzen, Steve Elkington and David Duval want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   None of them could shoot lower than 79, and Garcia fired his way
out of the tournament with an 18-over 89, the third-highest score
of the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of good players blown away today,''
Montgomerie said. ``They will be tomorrow, too, and Saturday and
Sunday if it remains this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't overcome it (the course). But I've done OK. I haven't
thrown it away. Some have. I haven't thrown it away in this round.
I haven't won it. But I haven't lost it. And that's key.''
</P>
<P>
   Monty was much like everybody else in that he had a lot of
bogeys _ five _ plus a double bogey. But he also had four birdies.
And he is thrilled to be hovering near the leaders. He won last
week at the Loch Lomond tournament near here, but he has missed the
cut in five of the last seven British Opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best position I've been in here,'' he said. ``Mind
you, that's not saying very much, is it? I don't have much of a
record to go on here, so anything is a damn improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Els agreed with Montgomerie that the goal was simply not to blow
sky high and eliminate oneself. Els was asked what he would think
if he could get three more 74s.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it stays like this, I will be happy with it,'' he said. ``I
played to my expectations. And if it stays like this, I'll take 74
each day.''
</P>
<P>
   Els had five birdies, six bogeys and a double bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``For three holes, I thought if the breeze stayed the way it
was, we'd actually have a chance to shoot par,'' he said. ``But
then it really started picking up on the fourth hole. So it was
really, really tough. It's just unbelievably tough. Anything under
76 is playing really well.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened to some players was almost comical, as long as you
weren't those guys. Some of the lowlights:
</P>
<P>
   Davis Love III whiffed a shot in the hayfield they call No. 12.
The resulting double bogey knocked him out of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's 89 whacks to get around Carnoustie included five double
bogeys and a triple.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Gump went double-quadruple-double on the bogey scale on
Nos. 7-9 en route to a front-nine 49. He recovered to shoot 85.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Lyle shot 85 _ with an eagle.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the wind wasn't the only thing howling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different, and it's nice to experience _ but you hope
only once,'' Duval said. ``When you hit a pitching wedge 200 yards,
there are too many variables. But you have to take pleasure in it.
If the average player had to play out there, he'd probably quit the
game. A lot of pros, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Open will be coming back here. I don't know
what they are trying to accomplish. The U.S. Open was very
difficult. But it was enjoyable. It shouldn't necessarily be
stress-free. But if you can't enjoy an event like this, then you've
got to question what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Norman: ``Starting with (No.) 6, I felt like I was
climbing Mount Everest. Anything in the mid-70s has to be a good
score.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps it was Lee Westwood who capsulized things best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a slog,'' he said, ``from start to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's no denying that somebody will win this event,
regardless of how ugly the victory might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm there on Sunday and I have shot 300 and won the
tournament, I don't care what number I put up, as long as I get the
cup,'' Els said.

   IRVING, Texas _ With training camp scheduled to begin in 10
days, Cowboys vice president Stephen Jones said the club will
likely extend initial contract offers to their eight draft picks
before the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the short window, Jones said he expects to have all the
players, including top pick Ebenezer Ekuban, signed and in camp on
time. Rookies and selected veterans are scheduled to report to
training camp in Wichita Falls on July 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our goal,'' Jones said. ``We've just got to get it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones won't have to worry about finding room under the league's
$57.28 million salary cap to sign any picks. Jones said the
Cowboys, who cleared $2 million by signing cornerback Deion Sanders
to a new deal last month, have enough money to sign the rookies and
still pursue some free agents before the start of the season Sept.
12.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, however, plans to focus on Ekuban, the former North
Carolina defensive end who is expected to get significant playing
time in a rotation with Greg Ellis and Kavika Pittman.
</P>
<P>
   Jones would not comment on what the Cowboys plan to offer
Ekuban. Ekuban's agent, Marvin Demoff, was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   A good benchmark for Ekuban, the 20th pick, is the contract
Green Bay defensive end Vonnie Holliday, the 19th pick in 1998,
signed last season. Holliday received a deal worth $5.61 million
over five years, including a $3 million signing bonus. Playing-time
incentives could increase the value of Ekuban's contract to $7.7
million.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys vice president Jerry Jones Jr. will handle negotiations
with the other rookies _ guard Solomon Page, linebacker Dat Nguyen,
receiver Wane McGarity, defensive end Peppi Zellner, receiver
MarTay Jenkins, guard Kelvin Garmon and tight end Mike Lucky.

MARINERS FANS, AT LAST, CAN GO OUT TO THE BALLGAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The American flag in left centerfield was blowing in
last night.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is something you never saw once at a Mariners game.
</P>
<P>
   During 22 and a half seasons in the Kingdome, no fresh air ever
swirled. The only breeze we ever felt was the aftermath of a Ken
Griffey Jr. homer or a Harold Reynolds stolen base or, yes, a Randy
Johnson fastball.
</P>
<P>
   But there was the flag in the evening air on Thursday night,
fluttering as every small gust kicked off Puget Sound, showing us
for certain we are in a whole new place.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to a whole new era, where last night there was light and
noise and where now there is plush green grass and the
peculiarities of weather.
</P>
<P>
   And so what about a little weather?
</P>
<P>
   Bring on the rain. Or let it shine.
</P>
<P>
   As the ceremonies kicked off, with the Seattle Symphony letting
loose with a ringing rendition of ``Also Sprach Zarathustra'' _ the
opening theme from ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' _ the wheels started
rolling and the roof was peeled back and there we all sat _ 44,000
bathed in Northwest marine fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   No one appreciated open skies more than Layne Nixon and Tim
Harder. The two 20-year-old Navy men are machinists stationed on
the U.S.S. Carl Vinson at Bremerton, Wash..
</P>
<P>
   ``We work in the propulsion room,'' Nixon said. ``It's the
bottom of the ship. When we come up on deck, everyone knows who the
machinists are. We're the ones who look like zombies. We're all
white and pasty. Our eyes don't open. We hardly ever get outside.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, every one of us who has spent time in the Kingdome is
like Nixon and Harder: just a bunch of propulsion room toilers
dying to see the light of day.
</P>
<P>
   That's why maybe we thought Safeco Field might not need a
retractable roof. But there it was _ waiting like a trusty, albeit
expensive, umbrella in the stand.
</P>
<P>
   There were other concerns coming into this new place, such as
how up in arms we were originally that we wanted Randy Johnson on
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   But Jamie Moyer did the honors last night and let's let bygones
be bygones.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is scheduled to pitch here Tuesday with his new team
from Arizona and there is no question that the Big Unit, despite
his troubled final weeks in Seattle, will get the standing ovation
worthy of a Cy Young Award winner whose strikeout sidearm heat
helped make Safeco Field possible.
</P>
<P>
   We also thought the new yard was going to cost $415 million, but
the price ballooned to $517 million as the project was rushed to
make sure the midsummer grand opening would take place on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home runs, not overruns,'' protesters out on Royal Brougham
Way chanted before the game, the utilitarian Kingdome in the
background, gray, tired and empty.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters' hand-written signs told the other side of the
Safeco Field story, the one that reminds us how foolish a game can
make us act.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta love these guys. You never hadda choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire owners and players on the public dole. Pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   And they are mostly right, of course, and God bless those with a
fiscal conscience for coming out to tell their version of the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   But, happily, there is something communal and thrilling about
coming out to the old ballgame. That is what the swarms of fans
snaking down Occidental Avenue demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Cox of West Seattle was the first through the turnstiles
Thursday night. The 50-year-old baseball fan waited 26 hours to
gain the honor. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the game. I played when I was a kid. It's a way for
people to get together and dump some of the facade you normally
have around you and just get out there and see the real person in
there,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   If much of what has surrounded this new outdoor stadium has been
contentious and expensive, Cox's reason for remaining a diehard fan
provides a decent explanation about why Safeco Field has a place in
Seattle's life.
</P>
<P>
   There is time now for all of us to test out the $7 bleacher
seats.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of time to go around and use the dozens of
Safeco Field bathrooms and their hundreds of stalls _ a luxury for
anyone who ever had a few too many ounces of beer or soda in the
Kingdome, then realized the lines were backed out to King Street.
</P>
<P>
   Amenities galore.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this place called Safeco Field is capable of stirring
envy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Seattle Symphony found the new ballpark so intriguing,
maestro Gerard Schwarz will go back and demand that a retractable
roof and green grass be installed in Benaroya Hall.

SALMON COULD PLAY AS SOON AS THIS WEEKEND
</HEADLINE>

By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Right fielder Tim Salmon will begin a rehab
assignment at Single-A Lake Elsinore today and could be in the
Angels' starting lineup this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to have me play in a game or two here before going
to Texas (next Wednesday),'' said Salmon, who has been out since
May 3 with a sprained left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon took batting practice during the break and again
Thursday, hitting off manager Terry Collins. He said he feels no
pain in the wrist but has general soreness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting harder and harder to get out of bed each day,''
Salmon said. ``But it's a true sign I'm playing again.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon took 70 swings Thursday and ran the bases. He'll bat
leadoff _ in order to get as many at-bats as possible _ and be the
DH at Lake Elsinore today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him when the game is over to call me and leave me a
message,'' Collins said of Salmon. ``Tell me how he feels. I don't
care if he goes 0 for 5 or 5 for 5, that's not the issue. Did you
check any swings? How's your bat speed?''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon said he would prefer not to go on a rehab assignment at
all, but he'll abide by Collins' wishes. Even so, it won't be for
very long.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be one of those guys who will have to play his
way into shape up here,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Edmonds progressing: The news is good also on center fielder
Jim Edmonds. Edmonds took batting practice for the first time since
surgery on his right shoulder April 19. He could begin a rehab
assignment early next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt OK,'' Edmonds said. ``It was like the first day of
spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Belcher plays catch: Pitcher Tim Belcher played catch
Wednesday for the first time since he broke the pinky finger on his
right (pitching) hand June 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've still got some soreness and tenderness, but it hasn't
been three weeks yet,'' Belcher said. ``Between the third and
fourth week (next week), I expect dramatic improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher said he doesn't think he'll need a rehab assignment
because once he starts pitching off the mound again, ``I need to
generate 100 percent arm speed and that's just a matter of a few
days.''
</P>
<P>
   __ More injury news: Outfielder Matt Luke (strained muscle in
side) and catcher Charlie O'Brien (strained foot ligament) took
batting practice and pitcher Mike James (elbow surgery) threw 60
pitches Thursday. Also, pitcher Jack McDowell made his third rehab
start for Triple-A Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   __ Collins skips game: Collins said he did not watch Tuesday's
All-Star Game. Instead he went to dinner at Spago in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard so much about it,'' Collins said. ``I've seen Pedro
(Martinez) strike out four of five and I've seen (Mark) McGwire hit
home runs in batting practice. The only thing I wanted to see was
Percy (Troy Percival). And he didn't pitch so I didn't miss
anything.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Every step of the way, it seems, Bruce
Springsteen has managed to produce the perfect songs and perfect
lyrics for the soundtrack to Matt Facendo's life.
</P>
<P>
   Facendo, 39, grew up in Hazlet, a Jersey guy like Springsteen.
His dad worked in a factory; so, too, did Springsteen's. He
escorted his younger brother, Doug, to his first Bruce Springsteen
concert, in Pittsburgh, when Doug was 12. He became a father just
as Springsteen was writing lyrics about the wonders of fatherhood.
And Facendo went through a bitter divorce _ just as Springsteen did
_ scathed, but full of appreciation for the small and precious
things in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can identify with him so much,'' said Facendo, a salesman
for Sears. ``He was writing songs about the emotional distress he
was going through, and you can identify with that. He's not better
than you when it comes to emotional or psychological problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Facendo wasn't the only one who was identifying with Springsteen
on Thursday. In fact, there were thousands of people who descended
upon the Continental Airlines Arena, right in the heart of the
swamps of Jersey, to absorb the first of 15 sold-out Springsteen
shows and, presumably, to make the kind of intimate connection that
few performers can hope to achieve in a big-arena setting.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of statistical posterity, of course, it should be
noted that there are many things about the 15-show stint from
Springsteen and the E Street Band that can be described as big, as
mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he will surpass the Grateful Dead as the leading
draw in the history of the arena. The 15-night run will be the
longest by a single artist, eclipsing Springsteen's own record of
11 shows in 1992. And the show figures to be one of the biggest
grossing concerts of the summer, if not in recent years. Fans
snatched up 308,000 tickets, about $75 each, for the East
Rutherford shows, from Wednesday to Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night they heard Springsteen say ``Good Evening, New
Jersey'' and open the concert with ``My Love Will Not Let You
Down'' and ``The Promised Land.'' Middle-aged guys pumped their
fists in the air when the E Street Band launched into ``Darlington
County.''
</P>
<P>
   The show lasted exactly three hours, ending with an encore
highlighted by Springsteen classics like ``Thunder Road,'' ``Bobby
Jean'' and ``Born to Run.'' The audience, like the song, was revved
up, but the length of the show had clearly gotten to some of them.
In Section 239, a man in his 40s who had taken his family along
rocked to the music as one of his young sons and his wife dozed,
oblivious to the amplified guitar strains and the pounding drums.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen and his band arrived in East Rutherford after
wrapping up a 17-city European tour. After they finish the New
Jersey shows, they will move on to Detroit, Boston, Washington and
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But box office statistics and record grosses were not the kinds
of conversational tidbits that could be heard in the parking lot of
the arena on Thursday afternoon, the kinds of things that pulled in
people of different generations.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, with Springsteen songs oozing from every other car,
there was the distinct sense that this was more than just a
concert: it was about appreciating the good times, waxing nostalgic
and sharing wistful thoughts about how Bruce _ and by extension,
everyone in the crowd who aged with him _ had changed over the
years, and that nothing, nothing, should be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than a decade, after all, since Springsteen
toured with the E Street Band, and there is no telling when, if
ever, they will perform together again on such a tour. Springsteen,
who turns 50 in September, has not had a big hit in many years; he
has not even released an album with new material in quite some
time. And he has written about changes in his life with the kind of
sharp details that a painter could appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, Springsteen's fans understand mortality in a way
that they didn't when they were 19,'' said Charles Cross, editor of
The Rocket, a music magazine based in Seattle, and author of a book
about Springsteen called ``Backstreets'' (Harmony Books, 1989).
``They find an appreciation for the moments where you can transcend
your life. There are a lot of pressures in life, so any time you
can have escapism in its purest form, people savor that.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, people had been gearing up for the return of
Springsteen, E Street band in tow, with all the attention worthy of
a Super Bowl. There were scads of Internet sites; detailed reports
about dress rehearsals in small New Jersey clubs; and preparations
for a boardwalk-like festival of food concessions and beach
volleyball complete with sand hauled in from, yes, the Jersey
Shore.
</P>
<P>
   In dozens of interviews in the Meadowlands parking lot on
Thursday, many people seemed, for a day at least, to exult in the
fact that they, too, were from New Jersey, and could identify with
Springsteen and his songs about working-class life, yearning and
frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glory Days'' played to the left. ``Thunder Road,'' coming from
the sport utility vehicle, to the right. ``Jungleland'' all around.
</P>
<P>
   In the section of the parking lot coded C23, Keith Wells was
sipping a drink with his friend Pete Mooney Jr. Two decades ago,
Wells spent hour after ear-pounding hour worshiping Bruce
Springsteen and the E Street Band on the radio, at his home by the
Jersey Shore, or, as often as possible, in concert. When he became
an adult, he said, he took his son Greg, then 9, to his first
concert: Bruce, of course.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, it was Greg's turn; he had bought a ticket for his
dad as a Father's Day gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listening to his songs is like talking to an old friend,''
said Wells, 51, a computer consultant who lives in Little Silver,
N.J., blasting what he said confidently was ``the best bootleg
collection'' of Springsteen songs _ ever _ from his green BMW.
</P>
<P>
   A few rows away, Mary Anne V. Gross was proudly displaying her
``Jersey Girl'' T-shirt, which she said she bought about a dozen
years ago, as a reminder of her devotion to that song, written by
Tom Waits and popularized by Springsteen, and to Springsteen
himself.
</P>
<P>
   A younger couple walked up and noticed Ms. Gross's T-shirt. They
asked to pose for a picture as another trophy for their memories.
</P>
<P>
   And still, it was an hour before the opening curtain.

HEROES INSPIRE SHEFFIELD

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Gary Sheffield got just one at-bat in
Tuesday's All-Star game, but he left Fenway Park with a lifetime of
memories.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder, who grounded to short as a
pinch-hitter for Jeff Bagwell, said the pregame ceremonies
involving former Boston great Ted Williams will never be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``There you have 40 of the greatest players who ever lived; Hank
Aaron, Willie Mays, and they are all standings there with their
mouths open over Ted,'' Sheffield said. ``Having them there with
today's All-Stars, (it) was so incredible to be part of that group
on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at them and they're looking at Ted. It was very
emotional. That was the history of the game right out there on the
mound.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who left for Boston on a redeye after Sunday's 14-3
victory over Seattle, got back to town Wednesday afternoon and was
excused from the club's workout at Dodger Stadium. Pitcher Carlos
Perez was the only other player to miss the workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did a lot of sleeping after that,'' Sheffield said. ``But I
wouldn't have missed that for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Setback for Osuna: Reliever Antonio Osuna hoped to return to
the Dodgers this weekend after missing most of the season due to
surgery for bone chips in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna experienced discomfort in his elbow Wednesday night during
a one-inning outing for Single-A San Bernardino's game at Modesto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to be back by now,'' said Osuna, who might be
activated when the Dodgers play a brief three-game series
(including a doubleheader Thursday) vs. Colorado at home. ``I feel
great, just little things that keep popping up.''

<P>
   The biggest hit Thursday for Derek Bell didn't come in the
seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was the one he took when he was demoted to the sixth spot in
the batting order.
</P>
<P>
   Angered over the decision to move him down in the order, Bell
took out his frustrations on the Detroit Tigers. Bell hit a
go-ahead two-run single in the seventh as the Astros rallied from a
six-run deficit for an 8-6 victory in manager Larry Dierker's first
game back since undergoing brain surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a slap in the face dropping me all the way down to
the sixth spot,'' said Bell, who entered the game batting .244 with
a National League-leading 92 strikeouts. ``It ain't right. I've
been battling all year. Yeah, I strike out a lot, but I've still
done a lot of things for this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the fans are treating me, I probably don't expect to
be here next season. For them to turn on me and boo every time I
swing and miss is not right. I think I may have worn out my
welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros welcomed Dierker back to the dugout with their fourth
straight win to remain in a virtual first-place tie with Cincinnati
in the National League Central. Dierker missed 27 games after
suffering a grand mal seizure June 13. He required brain surgery
two days later.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback was the Astros' biggest since overcoming a six-run
deficit July 23, 1998, at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we haven't done in a long time,'' said Jeff
Bagwell, who hit his 29th home run in the fifth inning. ``We
battled and got the big hits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored three runs in the fifth, two in the sixth and
three in the seventh to wipe out the huge deficit.
</P>
<P>
   With the Tigers leading 6-0, Bagwell hit a three-run homer off
Dave Mlicki. The Astros continued chipping away at the lead,
pulling within 6-5 in the sixth when Bell reached on an error and
scored on a triple by Tim Bogar. Pinch hitter Matt Mieske drove in
a run with a groundout.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers' pitching staff fell apart in the seventh. Reliever
Willie Blair (1-8) walked Bill Spiers and Bagwell to start the
inning, and Doug Brocail walked Richard Hidalgo to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who batted second or cleanup for most of the first half,
hit a one-out single up the middle to give the Astros their first
lead of the game. Bogar followed with an RBI grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Bell was informed of the decision that he would hit sixth prior
to the game. Dierker said a possible lineup switch had been
discussed for some time. He hoped the move would light a fire under
Bell, who struggled during parts of the first half and had only a
.298 on-base percentage to go with his numerous strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see Derek look at this as a challenge to work
his way back to hitting fourth or second,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not how Bell interpreted the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `We're dropping you to the sixth spot because
you're striking out too much to be the fourth hitter,''' Bell said.
``There's already a lot of pressure on me to go out there and do
everything right so people won't boo me. I feel like I'm not
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of Bell's teammates came to his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't be the fans' choice to get on him,'' Carl Everett
said. ``If you're a Houston Astros fan, you should cheer instead of
booing. I don't want to say anything profane, but they (the fans)
need to keep their mouths closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Trever Miller (1-1) pitched a scoreless seventh inning for the
victory, and Billy Wagner pitched the ninth for his 23rd save. Doug
Henry, making his first appearance since undergoing elbow surgery
in mid-May, along with Jay Powell, Wagner and Miller combined to
limit the Tigers to four hits over the final four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds allowed all six Detroit runs and eight hits in
five innings. He drew a warning from home-plate umpire Ed Rapuano
after throwing a pitch behind former Astro Brad Ausmus in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   On the Astros' side, Bagwell and Bogar were hit by pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their team understood it,'' said Reynolds, who had seven
strikeouts. ``We had a couple of guys get hit. Bags goes out and
busts his tail and works hard. You have to protect him _ not being
a headhunter and trying to hurt guys. It's over and done with.''

SECOND HALF BEGINS WITH BANG FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-PHILLIES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The All-Star break apparently is the pause that
refreshes, at least for every Red Sox player in the lineup except
the starting All-Star shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   With leadoff man Jose Offerman going deep on the third pitch he
saw from Phillies starter Paul Byrd, the first of three home runs
the Sox hit to start off an inning, and rookies Brian Daubach and
Trot Nixon collecting three hits apiece, the Sox came out swinging
against the Philadelphia Phillies in a 6-4 win Thursday &UR;  &LR; night
before a sellout crowd of 32,397 on Yawkey Way.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who had lost five out of six just before the break,
drew within three games of the New York Yankees in the American
League East, even though Nomar Garciaparra was shut out at the
plate and made a throwing error in his return to the starting
lineup after a nine-game absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt my timing was off a little bit,'' said Garciaparra,
whose 17-game hitting streak came to an end after he failed to get
the ball out of the infield in four trips, popping out three times
after grounding into a double play on which he ran half-speed in
the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to do anything stupid,'' Garciaparra said of not
running all out. ``I only play one way, but that's where you can
tell it's come along, where you do some things instinctively but
you can still hold up on others. I know that now.''
</P>
<P>
   The win, only the fourth in 13 interleague games for the Sox and
the first in almost a month (June 16) for rookie Brian Rose, was
not assured until Tim Wakefield left the bases loaded in the eighth
and the tying runs on base in the ninth for his 11th save in 12
chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had put up four runs on two home runs and two doubles on
their first pass through the order, but still required a bailout
from Wakefield. A white-knuckle save?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my knuckles were white,'' said catcher Jason Varitek,
who joined Offerman and Daubach in hitting home runs
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, and also tagged out Scott Rolen at the plate after
Wakefield grabbed Mike Lieberthal's chopper and threw home for the
biggest out of the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be when he's on the mound,'' Varitek said.
``There's some serious concentration going on, any time there's two
strikes and anybody's on base.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield, who had entered the game in the eighth with runners
on second and third and one run already in after Garciaparra's
error, pounced on Lieberthal's chopper to the left of the mound and
threw out Rolen, who slid head-first into Varitek's tag.
</P>
<P>
   A demonstration of Wakefield's cat-like reflexes?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess so,'' Wakefield said, ``if you can't think of another
animal slower than a cat.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield walked the next batter, Rob Ducey, to load the bases,
but retired Alex Arias on a grounder to Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's obvious frustration _ he flung his bat and slammed
his helmet after his second popup _ may have carried over into the
field, a rare occurrence. He made a throwing error in the eighth
inning, one in which first baseman Mike Stanley, flat on his
stomach and squarely in the path of runner Rolen, was forced to
duck for cover as Rolen leaped over him.
</P>
<P>
   Another Garciaparra throw pulled Stanley off the bag on Doug
Glanville's infield hit with one out in the ninth, and Wakefield
walked Ron Gant. The next batter, Bobby Abreu, already had homered
and tripled, but second baseman Offerman ended the night with a
fine defensive play, charging Abreu's grounder, tagging out Gant,
and flipping to Stanley for a double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only chance I had, especially the way Abreu runs,'' said
Offerman, whose home run into the bullpen marked a fresh start for
a man who ended the first half with just two hits in 38 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was an All-Star, Offerman didn't get much of a break.
``Even yesterday, I was in a park, watching my daughters (Joseann
and Jealynn) play baseball,'' he said. ``But it was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose, who gave up a home run to the first batter of the game,
Glanville, then was lifted two batters into the sixth after Abreu's
two-run home run made it 5-3, did better getting away from it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I signed the papers for my house, went furniture and appliance
shopping, and spent time with Tara and Ben,'' Rose said, referring
to his fiancee and her 2-year-old son, with whom Rose has been
close since birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know much about it, since this is my first full
year,'' Rose said, ``but personally, I think getting a break,
spending some time with our families, was good for all of us.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
After 32 days of what he termed ``being grounded,'' Astros manager
Larry Dierker was flying high again Thursday night.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was at his usual post in the home dugout as the Astros played
the Detroit Tigers, the memory of his terrifying grand mal seizure
during a June 13 game, the brain surgery two days later and
subsequent recuperation pushed aside for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   To the manager's delight, the Astros responded with an 8-6
victory after falling behind 6-0 in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a comeback for a (Dierker's) comeback,'' the manager
said. ``I can't remember a game that we were that far down and came
back to win this season. That's the kind of thing we did last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dierker, the win capped an evening he won't soon forget.
After the media crush had left his office following the game, he
reflected on events of the last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have all this, to be the manager of a major-league team and
to have played and been a broadcaster, I've had a life that most
guys could only dream about,'' Dierker said. ``Then, after this
situation (his seizure and surgery), I really feel I've sailed
through it pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of guys have made a lot more money and seen a lot
more of the world, but I wouldn't trade what I've got for
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Dierker stood at home plate, going over the
ground rules and exchanging small talk with the umpiring crew and
Detroit manager Larry Parrish. In the background, Cheeseburger In
Paradise was playing.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, life was beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little things that we all take for granted at times seem
more important now,'' Dierker said. ``Just walking out on the field
(for batting practice) and getting ready for a game, it's something
to savor.''
</P>
<P>
   Just more than one month ago, Dierker was rushed off the
Astrodome field in an ambulance after suffering the seizure. After
surgery to remove a mass from his brain that caused the seizure,
Dierker missed 27 games. When he returned Thursday, there was a
sense of relief and outpouring of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the last month has been like being in the Twilight
Zone,'' Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``It's been
surreal. This club has overcome so many unusual adversities, and
we're still in first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now to see Larry back, I think it's going to be a big
psychological lift to the club. Everything starts with leadership
at the top, and Larry's the leader. No matter who (interim manager
Matt Galante) stepped in there, it was a change. It's different. To
have him back gets everybody feeling like we're back on track,
we're back to normal and let's go get 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   In the seats, many in the crowd of 32,573 wore Hawaiian shirts,
which are favored by Dierker, to honor the manager. The Astros
handed out leis to the first 10,000 fans, adding another festive
element to the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel the fans throughout the game,'' Dierker said.
``Every time I looked up in the crowd, somebody would point to
their shirt to show they were with me. But most of the time, I was
just trying to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before the start of the game, Dierker jumped into the box
seats and presented his wife, Judy, with a lei made of fresh
flowers. The Dierkers celebrated their 24th wedding anniversary
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On his way back to the dugout, Dierker stopped to sign
autographs for a few fans, a gesture he says he will repeat more
often in the future. He received more than 1,000 get-well cards and
letters, an outpouring of how the city feels about a man who has
been part of the Houston franchise as a player, broadcaster and
manager for 34 of the last 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot more sympathetic toward the fans,'' Dierker said.
``I know that getting 1,000 get-well cards doesn't mean that
hundreds of thousands of people are all as sensitive and concerned
and caring as the people who sent the cards, but I got some really
touching things.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in the dugout after the exchange of lineup cards, Dierker
took off his baseball cap for a helmet. He said he would wear the
helmet while in the dugout the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker also was touched by the emotion of his players, who
prayed for him on the day of his seizure and who eagerly welcomed
him back Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says a lot about Larry's character, and it says a lot about
modern medicine,'' Astros second baseman Craig Biggio said. ``To go
through what Larry's gone through and what his family has gone
through and for him to be back today is really incredible.''

GARCIAPARRA BACK _ FOR REAL
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-GARCIAPARRA-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By SHIRA SPRINGER 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The wait was longer than usual. The infielder ate his
postgame meal slowly, out of necessity using only his left hand.
His thowing arm _ the right arm _ hung stiff and straight by his
side. Large bags of ice were wrapped tightly against his right
elbow and shoulder. The training staff secured another icy package
to his left hamstring and groin. He shared a few laughs with
teammates at the training table that seats three comfortably, he
finished his dinner, and then disappeared again into the far
reaches of the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Nomar Garciaparra reappeared, free of ice packs and
Ace bandages and ready to talk, most of the Red Sox clubhouse had
cleared out. The crowd that surrounded his locker stall close to an
hour after the game asked only a few questions. Some performances
require little comment, especially on those nights when there is
little good to comment upon.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night against Philadalphia, Garciaparra returned to the
Boston lineup . . . and his timing was all off. In his first at-bat
after a nine-game regular-season layoff, he hit into a double play.
Everyone watching knew that a truly healthy Garciaparra, a player
without his healing groin on his mind, would have run out the throw
from second. The cleanup hitter popped out in the second, fourth,
and seventh innings, finishing 0 for 4 and snapping a 17-game
streak.
</P>
<P>
   The shortstop committed an error in the eighth, thowing wide of
first base and pulling Mike Stanley off the bag. It was only
Garciaparra's second error in his last 24 games. In the ninth, the
All-Star again took Stanley off first base with an imperfect throw,
but the play was ruled a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt all right,'' said Garciaparra. ``I felt like my timing
was off a little bit. But as far as the injury is concerned, it
felt all right. So that's good . . . Definitely, (in the first
inning), I had to hold back a step. But you've got to be smart
first game back. I didn't want to do anything stupid. The first
inning was a good example. I usually beat that out, but you go out
there, and it's not good blowing out in the first. It puts me out
again. I've definitely got to be aware and be smart. Like I said
before, I'm definitely a lot better than I was a week ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star Game Tuesday afforded Garciaparra the luxury of a
rehabilitation start without leaving home. It put the shortstop in
a game situation without placing the pressure to win on his
shoulders. He played three innings and went 0 for 2 in the
midsummer classic. But more importantly, he got back some feel for
the game and proved wrong local baseball pundits who were concerned
the infielder would reinjure his groin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped me go out there and get to see a couple pitches _ I
hadn't seen any in nine days,'' said Garciaparra, who's batting
.361 and hit .394 in June during the streak and before the injury.
``It was a good time to go out there and see how I felt. It felt
good. It felt good enough to play. You go out there in a game
situation and everything. It was great. That's what I was saying
all along. It seems like people don't listen to me. They think they
know more.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Thursday night's error and cautious play showed the
shortstop was far from 100 percent healthy. Garciaparra doesn't
worry about the groin injury that kept him out since July 2
becoming a nagging injury, but he knows that it's too much to ask
for perfect health in the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't come from an injury and be 100 percent,'' he said.
``We play baseball. We play every day. Give me five months off, and
maybe I'll be at 100.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Garciaparra, some waits take longer than
others. After all, timing is everything.

A NIGHT OF MANY RETURNS AS THE BOSS COMES HOME
</HEADLINE>
  
(With BC-SPRINGSTEEN-CONCERT)  (sw) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It would have been very difficult to
leave the Continental Airlines Arena disappointed on Thursday
night, when Bruce Springsteen began his first American tour with
the E Street Band in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   If Springsteen's work is a journey _ and it is, not just in his
close relationship with his fans but also for the characters whose
development he follows from album to album _ then Thursday night's
three-hour, 26-song show stopped at nearly all points on the map.
</P>
<P>
   The show was a return in many ways for Springsteen. It was a
return to his home state of New Jersey, and in dedication he
performed a rarely heard song, ``Freehold,'' a funny yet pointed
confessional folk song in which the Boss returns to the town that
still remembers him as a baby.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a return to the Continental Airlines Arena, where he
performed the inaugural concert when the arena opened in 1981 under
its pre-corporate sponsorship name of the Brendan Byrne Arena.
Thursday night's show was the first of 15 sold-out concerts _ the
most a single act has ever performed at the arena _ which wrap up
on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   It was a return to the E Street Band, most of whom Springsteen
has been playing with since he was a teen-ager in Asbury Park.
Though he laid off the band in 1989, he keeps returning to them, as
if they are the only way to provide a counterbalance to his more
introspective, psychological solo work. When the group tried to
tackle one of those ballads, ``The Ghost of Tom Joad,'' they had
difficulty. The E Street Band isn't an outfit that is very good at
not rocking. The band, as Springsteen has said, is a symbolic
bridge between him and his audience.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was a return to Springsteen's fans. His career has
tended to cycle between those introspective albums that document
his internal battles with cynicism and despair and the full-band
rock ones that his audience craves. So, after he released an
audience-pleaser with new E-Street Band songs, ``Greatest Hits,''
in 1995, he turned inward with ``The Ghost of Tom Joad.'' Turning
right back around, over the last year he has given his fans two
things they've been asking for most: ``Tracks,'' a four-CD set full
of the songs he hadn't released over the years, and this tour.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in all black (even his shoes, belt and wrist bands _
everything except his gray hair), Springsteen, 49, didn't just lead
his band, he led the crowd, making them believe in the great live
rock and roll illusion: that their participation _ their yelling,
clapping, singing along _ is necessary to complete the music.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,'' he egged on the crowd with
several minutes of James Brown-like soul-preacher testimony,
joking, as he shook his hips, ``Look out Ricky Martin . . . I'm
filled with the spirit of the ghost of Tom Jones.'' In ``Murder
Incorporated,'' he took time for every guitarist _ Nils Lofgren,
Steve Van Zandt, and himself _ to solo after standing aside
momentarily for Clarence Clemons, the master of the rock sax solo.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen returns when rock and roll needs him most, when
arenas are filled either with manufactured teeny-bopper bands, or
the music of older teen-agers, white rock bands whose idea of
classic pop is gangsta rap. But what most of these bands _ from `N
Sync to today's Rolling Stones _ lack is depth, the quality that
keeps three hours with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band from
being nostalgia. As a man who's always sung of borders
psychological and physical, Springsteen is aware that he stands on
this border, and to stay on the right side he waited until he was
10 songs into the set before playing an actual hit, ``Badlands.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the show leaned heavily on the same album that
``Badlands'' was on, ``Darkness on the Edge of Town,'' from 1978.
It was the perfect way to avoid being a nostalgia act: by jumping
behind nostalgia, going back to the album that predated the first
of his many successive breakthroughs. It was in those songs that
the themes that he would wrestle with in albums to come began to
crystallize: the characters balanced on the brink of a decision,
staring at the abyss, ready to jump in with the slim hope that just
maybe their dreams might await them at the bottom. ``I believe in
the faith,'' he sang in ``Badlands.'' ``And I pray, that someday it
may raise me/Above these badlands.''
</P>
<P>
   The two recent unreleased songs he performed on Thursday night,
``Land of Hope and Dreams'' (the show's gospel-derived closer) and
``Freehold,'' bore out his belief that, yes, he could rise above
it. Mr. Springsteen's gift has always been that now matter how far
he's risen, he's never left the ground he is rooted in.

SPARKS HAVE YET TO PEAK?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ This is the time of season when the Sparks
are usually looking to replace their coach. But not this time.
Under the direction of coach Orlando Woolridge, the team is 10-5,
the best start in their three-year history in the WNBA. At this
pace, they are a cinch to advance to the playoffs for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks have won seven of their last eight games and are tied
with Sacramento for second place in the Western Conference. But
while their record indicates success, they have yet to become the
dominant team they hope to be down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy with the record we have now, (but) we all would
like for it to be better,'' Woolridge said. ``The great thing about
it is ... we haven't peaked yet as a basketball team. I think the
better part of our game has yet to come. If I looked at us as
(potentially) 100 percent effective, I would say we're about 80.
There's a lot of room for improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Leslie, who returned from the inaugural WNBA All-Star game
with the MVP trophy, has yet to reach her stride, Woolridge said.
Her scoring and rebounding averages are both down from a year ago
(15.8 from 19.6 and 8.0 from 10.2, respectively).
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go down the list to everyone on team and there's so much
room for improvement, and they realize it,'' Woolridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent changes in the lineup have inspired the Sparks as well.
Forward La'Keisha Frett, who was hampered with tendinitis in her
left knee in training camp, has come on strongly lately and
provided the Sparks with another threat. She replaced Tamecka
Dixon, who has been struggling offensively. Mwadi Mabika replaced
Allison Feaster and Ukari Figgs, the rookie point guard from
Purdue, is expected to return to the court Saturday when the Sparks
resume play at Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks released general manager Rhonda Windham for
``philosophical reasons'' after the team fell to 3-4. Since Sparks
president Johnny Buss assumed responsibilities and sought to solve
player disenchantment, the team has gone 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the wisdom of his father, Lakers owner Jerry Buss,
Johnny got involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lent an ear, listened to problems and the gripes and
understood,'' Johnny Buss said. ``I agreed with them. And once I
became aware, not only of the problems and the gripes, I couldn't
understand how anybody could play under those circumstances. So we
changed it. It didn't take long to figure out where they were
coming from. It didn't take long to understand how to fix it. Once
that happens, it's still going to be a step-by-step process.''
</P>
<P>
   Attendance is also a problem. The Sparks are second-to-last in
the league, averaging 6,799. It's enough for Buss to renew his
contract with the league (6,000 is the minimum) but not enough to
keep him happy. He poured $1 million more into the
advertising-promotion budget this year, but it hasn't translated at
the box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly concerned, the league office is certainly
concerned,'' Buss said. ``I really can't figure it out as a
promoter. We provide great entertainment.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ An ex-Anaheim Angel and a guy named Angel
helped the Los Angeles Dodgers rally from a four-run deficit, but
Mo Vaughn's 10th-inning single gave the Angels a 7-6 victory
Thursday night before a sellout crowd of 43,911 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's hit came off Dodgers reliever Onan Masaokaand scored
Randy Velarde from second base.
</P>
<P>
   Devon White's three-run homer off Angels starter Chuck Finley
gave the Dodgers their first lead of the night at 6-5 in the fifth
inning. Earlier in the game, Dodgers catcher Angel Pena had a
two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the home run, White also had a double and two singles
and is 9 for 17 with two homers and nine RBI in four games against
the Angels this season. His grand slam keyed a 7-4 win over the
Angels on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   But White's big hit didn't stand up because Pedro Borbon,
pitching in relief of starter Kevin Brown, couldn't hold the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde had to be happy to see Brown gone when he came up in the
seventh. After looking bad in three at-bats against Brown, striking
out twice, Velarde homered off Borbon, tying the game at 6.
</P>
<P>
   It also increased Velarde's hitting streak to 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had their ace throwing, but neither Brown nor Finley
pitched like it.
</P>
<P>
   Brown gave up five runs and five hits in 51/3 innings, striking
out six and walking three. Finley gave up six runs and eight hits
in five innings, striking out six and walking four. Neither was
involved in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got on the scoreboard first, scoring four runs in the
second inning against Brown. And the key to the inning came because
Orlando Palmeiro couldn't get a bunt down.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and second and none out, Palmeiro fouled
off two bunt attempts. On a 0-2 pitch, he slapped a grounder just
inside first and down the right-field line for a double, scoring
Garret Anderson from second for a 1-0 Angels lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Huson, in the DH spot for the second time this season,
followed with a single to right to score two more and give the
Angels a 3-0 lead. Huson went to third on Gary DiSarcina's flyout
to right, and after a walk to Matt Walbeck, scored when Darin
Erstad grounded into a fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-0 lead was tenuous at best, as Finley struggled in the
first few innings before the Dodgers broke through for three runs
in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   They scored one run and had the bases loaded with one out
without hitting the ball out of the infield. Three infield singles
and a walk resulted in their first run before Pena's two-run single
narrowed the Angels' lead to 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Huson's RBI double in the bottom of the fourth increased the
Angels' lead to 5-3, but it only lasted until White batted in the
top of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   White blasted a three-run homer, his eighth of the season to
give the Dodgers a 6-5 lead.

KINGS SIGN DRAFT CHOICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS

<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ With only a bit more than seven weeks remaining
until the start of training camp, the Los Angeles Kings chipped
away at their long list of unsigned players Thursday, getting
signatures from winger Steve McKenna and defenseman Frantisek
Kaberle.
</P>
<P>
   Both players signed one-year contracts. McKenna missed most of
last season with an abdominal injury, and Kaberle, 25, was selected
by the Kings in the third round of last month's NHL draft. The
6-foot-1, 185-pound Kaberle was named the most valuable defenseman
in Sweden last season, and the Kings are hoping for immediate
contributions from him.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are hoping the 6-8, 247-pound McKenna, 25, will fill
the enforcer's role vacated by Matt Johnson, who was lost to
Atlanta in last month's expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' list of restricted free agents includes defenseman
Mattias Norstrom, winger Glen Murray and goalie Stephane Fiset.
Training camp begins Sept. 4 at Iceoplex.
</P>
<P>
   __ Red Wings sign Legace: Former Kings goalie Manny Legace
signed a multi-year contract with the Detroit Red Wings on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes less than a week after Detroit's signing of free
agent goalie Ken Wregget as a backup to Chris Osgood.
</P>
<P>
   Legace, 26, played in 17 games with the Kings last season,
posting a 2-9-2 record with a 2.60 goals-against-average and a .911
save percentage. He was 22-18-4 with a 2.97 GAA in 47 games with
the Long Beach Ice Dogs last season, his fourth Minor League
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an exceptional young goaltender and he will add more
depth to our goaltending position,'' Detroit general manager Ken
Holland said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings lost three goalies in the past four months after
Bill Ranford was waived, Norm Maracle was lost in the expansion
draft and Kevin Hodson was traded to Tampa Bay.

STRUGGLING TO LEARN THE TRIANGLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Lakers played their
triangle more like a team of Ed Grimley's than a newly inspired
Phil Jackson troupe.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, this was a Thursday in July. Jackson wasn't behind
the bench, and even though his signature triangle offense
continually sputtered, it didn't matter in this exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   A crew of young Lakers and hopefuls lost to a similar group of
Portland Trail Blazers 109-81 in the NBA summer pro league at the
Pyramid. Tyronn Lue, Ruben Patterson and Travis Knight were the
marquee players for the Lakers, but it was apparent winning wasn't
their main objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know for me I have to take my time, learn the offense and
make sure to rest my ankle,'' Lue said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Lakers fell to 1-3 in this summer's exhibition
season is irrelevant. But other facts, such as Devean George's
performance, could be relevant. George, a swingman from Augsburg
(Minn.) and the Lakers' first-round draft pick, looked especially
loose and showed an array of offensive skills with 14 points and
five rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to show the Lakers I can play hard, be relaxed and not
worry when I'm out there,'' George said. ``I think I can fit in on
this team coming off the bench as a good role player.''
</P>
<P>
   Another role player is Ruben Patterson, who missed part of this
shortened season with tendinitis in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson also could be a part of a good matchup tonight at 7:30
p.m. at the Pyramid when the Lakers meet the Celtics. Patterson
likely will have the assignment of guarding Paul Pierce, who scored
46 points on Wednesday and was one of the top rookies this season.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce, from Kansas, and Patterson, from Cincinnati, played
against each other in college and are friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can shoot the ball better than me,'' Patterson said. ``But
I have quickness and can play tough defense. I'm going to put the
glove on him.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Giant small forward? The Dallas Mavericks' Dirk Nowitzki is a
unique player in the summer pro league. Nowitzki, a native of
Germany, is 7-feet tall and plays small forward. He just finished
his first season with the Mavs, averaging 8.2 points and 3.4
rebounds and starting 24 games.
</P>
<P>
   Considering Nowitzki's atypical style of play, some questioned
his selection at ninth in the draft, one pick before Pierce.
Nowitzki, however, might work out after all.
</P>
<P>
   He received substantial playing time at the beginning of the
Mavs' season, but after having several rough games, had his playing
time cut. Near the end of the season, he received a second chance
and became a frequent contributor to the Mavs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is so different here than Europe, there definitely
was an adjustment,'' Nowitzki said. ``Europe plays much more team
basketball. Here the athletes are much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki, 21, is developing and seems to have a strong
understanding of his skills. He said his biggest problem is that
typical NBA power forwards are too strong for him to guard under
the basket, while small forwards sometimes are too fast for him.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Nowitzki could be on his way to a strong NBA career
and could develop into a player similar to his idol, Scottie
Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mavs' game on Thursday, Nowitzki scored 22 points to help
lead the Mavs over the Vancouver Grizzlies 107-105. His teammate,
guard Anthony Carter from Hawaii, outshined him with 29 points and
10 assists.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WHAT'S a Hawaiian holiday without a few simmering volcanoes?
</P>
<P>
   This was a night when Astros manager Larry Dierker was supposed
to sit back and drink in his triumphant return as if the Astrodome
had a giant paper umbrella stuck through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Strains of Parrothead music wafted through the Astrodome on
Thursday night as Dierker carried the lineup card to the umpires. A
sea of Hawaiian shirts clashed disgustingly with the orange and
yellow Dome seats.
</P>
<P>
   And welcome-back banners were everywhere for the man who
underwent brain surgery barely a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel the crowd the entire game,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   But during it all, the triumphant part for Dierker looked to be
in serious doubt and nearly everywhere else things were more than a
bit sticky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a good tester for Dierk's ol' noggin,'' Astros third
baseman Bill Spiers said.
</P>
<P>
   Yup, it was. And some of the brain strain was self-inflicted,
albeit necessarily so.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Dierker demoted Derek Bell to the six hole in
the lineup in an attempt to stir the right fielder's bat.
</P>
<P>
   The move might not seem like a big deal, but the finicky Bell
would give the FUBU shirt off his back for a chance to bat second
every day.
</P>
<P>
   No one knew how Bell would react to such a demotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was something he embraces,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A slap in the face,'' Bell called it.
</P>
<P>
   Simmer, simmer.
</P>
<P>
   Also before the game, Dierker said his only big concern was
being able to come through with the right call in the clutch, which
apparently was not also the umpiring crew's big concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm wondering if the decision-making is going to be the same
when situations come up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But consider Dierker's brainpower tried, tested and proven.
</P>
<P>
   There were situations and challenges almost every step of the
way, and Dierker and the Astros couldn't have responded better on
the way to an 8-6 win over the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Astros fell behind the Tigers 6-0 going into the
bottom of the fifth inning, which in itself is enough to strain any
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Jeff Bagwell twice was brushed back from the plate by
Tigers hurlers, once getting hit by a pitch, causing Astros starter
Shane Reynolds to retaliate with a fastball behind former teammate
Brad Ausmus.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few players in both dugouts sat up on their bench as
tensions mounted and plate umpire Ed Rapuano warned Reynolds for
the tight pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Simmer, simmer.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the umpiring crew, which by the end of the night
had some 32,573 fans willing to pen the first draft of their
proposed letters of resignation in protest of labor issues.
</P>
<P>
   As the Astros mounted their seventh-inning comeback for the win,
Carl Everett slapped a high-hopping grounder up the middle and
clearly beat out shortstop Deivi Cruz's throw to first.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone but first-base umpire Charlie Williams knew Everett
should have been called safe. Dierker hopped out of his seat ready
to argue the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother's dead, and she could have seen that (I was
safe),'' Everett said. ``I have no idea why he made that call.''
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, Everett strained a hamstring stretching for the
bag on the play and crumbled to the ground in pain, packing yet
more worries into the head of a skipper familiar with putting
players on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing Carl is going to be one of the tougher things,''
Dierker said. ``But it was a wonderful win _ a comeback for the
comeback.''
</P>
<P>
   The skipper passed so many tests so well.
</P>
<P>
   Even the game-winning hit proved Dierker's risky strategy smart.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bell, batting in the No. 6 hole, who smashed a two-run
single through the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone left the building happy, dancing to Jimmy Buffett
music.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker and the Astros drank it all in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being his comeback, we didn't want to lose this one,'' Spiers
said. ``When we started scoring and won it, I had that feeling like
last year: `Wow, we haven't done this in a while.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll get going real good now.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like old times.

STEAM RISING AS UMPIRES STEW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Major-league umpires expected to get booed
when they took the field Thursday night and they were right.
</P>
<P>
   But Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Gary Sheffield, who has
learned a little about getting booed during his 11-year career,
said being right is more important than public opinion in the
umpires' dispute with the commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without unity they don't have a chance,'' Sheffield said.
``Umpires have to stay together in their beliefs. That is how the
players have done so well against the owners. The game wouldn't be
the same without them.''
</P>
<P>
   The umpires certainly hope so, especially during pennant races
and postseason play. Tension, which has been growing for nearly
three years, bubbled over Wednesday when Richie Phillips, head of
the umpires' union, said 57 of the 68 umpires would resign
effective Sept. 2
</P>
<P>
   The umpires are fearful the owners are attempting to break the
union and install high school and college umpires next season. The
collective-bargaining agreement between the two sides expires in
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a lot of baseball being played in December,'' said umpire
Joe Brinkman, crew chief for the Dodgers/Anaheim Angels series at
Edison Field. ``The decision to resign was made to protect our
interest and the season is our leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Brinkman arrived in Anaheim on Thursday morning after attending
a five-hour meeting of major-league umpires in Philadelphia. Owners
have said they will address the proposal, but no plans have been
set to begin negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to resign was presented because the umpires have a
no-strike provision in the existing agreement. If they went on
strike, the umpires would forfeit more than $15 million in
termination pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be voiding the terms of our contract and I would
assume they could void the rest of the agreement, too,'' Brinkman
said.''
</P>
<P>
   The termination pay scale runs from $150,000 for a 10-year
umpire to $400,000 for an umpire with 20 or more years of service.
</P>
<P>
   But Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros, an active member of the
players association during the 1994 work stoppage, wondered if the
umpires aren't giving the owners too much time to make contingency
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that much about the whole thing,'' Karros said.
``But I would say, `Don't back yourself into a corner.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Brinkman admitted that the umpires want to get the issue
resolved without a disruption. Under Phillips' plan, the umpires
would resign, form their own company, and be contracted back to
baseball without working under the umbrella of the commissioner's
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year when the NFL officials were getting a lot of heat
for some calls, what was the first thing (commissioner) Paul
Tagliabue did,'' Brinkman said. ``He ended the issue by saying,
`These guys are the best in the business.' He backed them up. We
never see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brinkman said the umpires are united in their plan, although it
has been reported that there is a group within the union that wants
to oust Phillips and bring in noted players' agent Ron Shapiro.
Some believe Phillips, who used to represent former Dodgers catcher
Mike Scioscia, often acts more like a bully than a negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   If or how the umpires' threats affect the final 4{ weeks of the
season remains to be seen. In 1995, umpires missed the first 86
games of the regular season when they were locked out by owners.
They went on strike in 1979 and missed the first seven weeks. They
also missed the first seven games of the 1985 playoffs because of a
strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to wait and see how it turns out,'' said Angels
manager Terry Collins, who went to Eastern Michigan University with
AL umpire Rocky Roe. ``I don't' worry about that stuff. I've got
enough problems of my own.''

DEPARTURES MARK END OF ERA AT STUDIO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
LOS ANGELES -- Shock rolled through Hollywood on Thursday as the
co-chiefs of Warner Bros., Robert A. Daly and Terry Semel,
announced their resignations after two decades of running the
industry's top studio.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Daly and Semel, who have been both the longest-serving and
most-consistently successful executives in one of the world's
most-volatile businesses, will leave by the end of the year to
pursue unspecified ``new opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The low-key pair, who eschewed publicity in a business that
craves it, said they reached the decision during a recent vacation.
The resignations caught Hollywood -- typically rife with rumors --
completely off guard; the mood at the Warner lot in Burbank, where
close to 10,000 people work, was described as ``absolutely sober''
by a longtime employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This came out of the blue,'' said David Davis, an analyst with
Houlihan Lokey Howard and Zukin in Los Angeles. ``It really is the
end of an era.''
</P>
<P>
   The clout of Daly, 62, and Semel, 56, has been so overwhelming
that no clear successor exists. Internal candidates include WB
Network's Jamie Kellner, HBO's Jeff Bewkes and New Line's Robert
Shaye, while others could be one-time Sony chief Mark Canton and
former Universal executive Frank Biondi.
</P>
<P>
   Daly and Semel pledged to work with Time Warner Chairman Gerald
Levin and President Richard Parsons for a smooth transition. ``This
is being handled in a very straightforward and gentlemanlike way,''
said PaineWebber managing director Christopher Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   Observers said Daly and Semel, both New York natives, have
inspired a high level of loyalty as subordinates are holdovers from
the days when Warner was a stand-alone company prior to its
landmark 1990 merger with Time Inc. The duo, who often work in New
York, have accumulated a staggering amount of power in the movie,
TV and music businesses -- all volatile enterprises prone to wild
swings in fortune due to rapid-fire changes in customer tastes.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other studio, Warner relied on big-budget
``tent-pole'' productions, superstars like Mel Gibson and
recognizable vehicles like the ``Batman'' and ``Lethal Weapon''
franchises. ``Bob and Terry really defined what Warner was all
about, and they did a superb job,'' Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
   The collaborative style served them well, according to Brad
Marks, head of an executive recruiting firm. ``They really had
complementary skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's friendship and trust, two people can be very
effective. Daly is a great big-picture kind of guy, while Terry is
more the operating guy overseeing the day-to-day business.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly and Semel also were regarded as gifted at relationships
with stars like Gibson, Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford and Kevin
Costner. Both often journeyed with stars in a corporate jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty unusual to see that kind of sharing of power,''
said Steve Cesinger, managing director at Greif &AMP; Co. ``If you look
at top people in Hollywood, sharing the glory is not high on the
list. It's a good structure for executives to get second-guessed on
$100 million decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the duo will be remembered best for ``Batman'' and
``Lethal Weapon,'' their credits include landmark films with
commercial and critical successes such as ``Chariots of Fire,''
``Arthur,'' ``The Killing Fields,'' ``Driving Miss Daisy,''
``GoodFellas,'' ``Unforgiven,'' ``The Fugitive'' and ``L.A.
Confidential.'' TV hits include ``E.R.'' and ``Friends,'' and the
WB Network has topped expectations with successes like ``Buffy, the
Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair's reputations were tarnished two years ago amid a box
office slump that led to carping about over-reliance on outdated
formulas. Other trackers complained that Levin's 1995 decision to
give Daly and Semel control over music stretched their abilities
too thin.
</P>
<P>
   But the studio's performance has turned around with Time Warner
stock up 250 percent since the start of 1998. Shares fell $1.4375
to $75.875 on Thursday, the day after Time Warner posted
better-than-expected profits in all divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Warner is third in film share this year behind 20th Century Fox
and Universal with $480 million in domestic gross, and its latest,
the much-awaited ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' opens today with solid
prospects. Its next three films -- ``Deep Blue Sea,'' ``Iron
Giant'' and ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' -- should perform well, according
to Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've done a good job of adjusting to the shift
toward the teen-age market becoming so powerful. Warner has been
the single most consistent performer, and that's the key in this
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Several industry trackers compared Thursday's decision to the
retirement of basketball superstar Michael Jordan. ``Daly and Semel
are going out on a high note,'' said Barry Hyman, market strategist
with Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ``It's hard to see what else they
could have accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair did not indicate whether they will continue their
partnership, but several trackers suggested Daly and Semel might
move into an Internet venture. ``I would be shocked if they just
rode off into the sunset,'' Cesinger said.
</P>
<P>
   When the two started with the company 20 years ago, the film and
television group had revenues of less than $1 billion; by the end
of 1998, it reported revenues of approximately $6 billion. Their
partnership began in 1980 when Daly was hired as chairman after
working as chief CBS programmer while Semel was working as vice
president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Marks said Levin and Turner should move quickly to find a
successor or successors, but they should start by first agreeing on
Warner Bros.' strategic direction. ``In a peculiar way, Daly and
Semel leaving is very opportune,'' he added. ``Time Warner can
develop a job description without an individual in mind and then
find the best person.'' &QL;

SUPERIOR'S PROFITS DEFY FORECASTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Superior Industries International Inc. reported
Thursday that second-quarter earnings jumped 56 percent compared
with the like year-ago period, easily beating Wall Street's
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The Van Nuys-based maker of aluminum wheels for vehicles and
auto accessories earned $19.2 million, or 71 cents per diluted
share, vs. $12.3 million, or 44 cents per diluted share, in the
comparable period last year. Revenues were $155 million, up 12
percent from $138.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Seven analysts surveyed by First Call had predicted earnings
averaging 64 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Tadross, senior auto parts analyst for Prudential
Securities Inc. in New York City, said he had initially predicted
earnings of 63 cents per share. But he upped it to 70 cents Tuesday
following the company's announcement that it expected to end the
quarter at 69 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The company has kept costs under control and increased gross
profits, resulting in the strong results, he said. Some significant
new contracts with automotive manufacturers also helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``They saw some good internal growth -- 3 percent to 5 percent
-- and I think they're reducing their costs faster than they're
giving price concessions,'' Tadross said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he has a ``hold'' recommendation on the stock, in part
because the company's internal growth, while good, was ``slower
than the average.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I expect that to pick up toward the end of 2000,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Superior's stock rose 12.5 cents Thursday to close at $28.375.
</P>
<P>
   Unit shipments were up 20 percent and Superior's plants were
operating at ``very high utilization capacity,'' said R. Jeffrey
Ornstein,company vice president and chief financial officer.
Earnings had been running about 64 cents per share earlier in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quarter just picked up a lot of momentum as it went,''
Ornstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Superior also said that during the quarter it bought about
169,000 shares of its stock and has now acquired 1.154 million
shares under its 2 million-share repurchase authorization.

MO GIVES ANGELS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (QUICK WRITETHROUGH) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Mo Vaughn's single off Onan Masaoka in the
10th inning scored Randy Velarde from second base to give the
Anaheim Angels a 7-6 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers before a
sellout crowd of 43,911 Thursday night at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the Angels' fifth in six games and allowed them
to keep pace with the Texas Rangers, who also won Thursday, 6 1/2
games back in the A.L. West.
</P>
<P>
   For the Dodgers, the loss snapped their winning streak at four
and dropped them 11 games behind first-place San Francisco in the
N.L. West.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Petkovsek (9-2) pitched two scoreless inning in relief to
earn the victory and become the winningest pitcher on the Angels
staff. Alan Mills (2-2) got the loss for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Dodgers manager Davey Johnson would even pitch to
Vaughn was curious. With Velarde on second base, first base was
open and his run meant nothing. Also, Vaughn went into the game
hitting .393 vs. lefties, compated to .239 against right-handers.
</P>
<P>
   So it couldn't have come as a surprise to many that Vaughn lined
a 2-2 pitch past Mark Grudzielanek at short and into left field,
easily scoring Velarde for the Angels win.
</P>
<P>
   Former Angel Devon White's three-run homer off Angels starter
Chuck Finley gave the Dodgers their first lead of the night at 6-5
in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   White, who also had a double and two singles, is hitting .529 (9
for 17) with two homers and nine RBIs in four games against the
Angels this season. His grand slam keyed a 7-4 win over the Angels
on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   But White's big hit didn't stand up because Pedro Borbon,
pitching in relief of starter Kevin Brown, couldn't hold it.
</P>
<P>
   Angels second baseman Randy Velarde had to be happy to see Brown
gone when he came up in the seventh. After looking bad in three
at-bats against Brown, striking out twice, Velarde homered off
Borbon, tying the game at 6.
</P>
<P>
   It also increased Velarde's hitting streak to 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had their ace throwing, but neither Brown nor Finley
pitched like it.
</P>
<P>
   Brown gave up five runs and five hits in 5 1/3 innings, striking
out six and walking three. Finley gave up six runs and eight hits
in five innings, striking out six and walking four. Neither was
involved in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got on the scoreboard first, scoring four runs in the
second inning against Brown. And the key to the inning came because
Orlando Palmeiro couldn't get a bunt down.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and second and none out, Palmeiro fouled
off two bunt attempts. On a 0-2 pitch, he slapped a grounder just
inside first and down the right-field line for a double, scoring
Garret Anderson from second for a 1-0 Angels lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Huson, in the DH spot for the second time this season,
followed with a single to right to score two more and give the
Angels a 3-0 lead. Huson went to third on Gary DiSarcina's flyout
to right, and after a walk to Matt Walbeck, scored when Darin
Erstad grounded into a fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-0 lead was tenous as best, as Finley struggled in the
first few innings before the Dodgers broke through for three runs
in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The scored one run and had the bases loaded with one out without
hitting the ball out of the infield. Three infield singles and a
walk resulted in their first run before Angel Pena's two-run single
narrowed the Angels' lead to 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Huson's RBI double in the bottom of the fourth increased the
Angels' lead to 5-3, but it only lasted until White batted in the
top of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   White blasted a three-run homer, his eighth of the season to
give the Dodgers a 6-5 lead.

BAERGA REMEMBERS '95 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It was nothing against the city, Carlos Baerga said.
When the San Diego Padres infielder played for the Cleveland
Indians, he always enjoyed coming to the Northwest. But the
Kingdome was such a downer, he couldn't wait to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't see that many fans in the ballpark,'' Baerga said.
``They were losing all the time. It's a beautiful city, but you
only wanted to be there a couple of days and then go.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything changed in 1995, when it took Baerga's Indians _ a
powerhouse that went 100-44 in the regular season _ to finally halt
the Mariners' postseason joyride.
</P>
<P>
   Baerga said the hardest time he ever had concentrating on a
field was in the '95 playoffs, because of the noise. He reflected
on that postseason Thursday with teammate Jim Leyritz, the Yankee
catcher Ken Griffey Jr. slid past to win the Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the '94 strike, that did so much for baseball in
general, much less the Seattle Mariners,'' Leyritz said. ``And I
think the job Randy Johnson did that series and the sacrifice he
made going out there that day really generated a lot of interest
and support here.''
</P>
<P>
   If not for that victory, Seattle wouldn't have opened a new
ballpark Thursday night _ and would never have become the baseball
town it is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York, you walk down the street and they know who you
are,'' said Mariners third baseman Russ Davis, a Yankee in '95.
``And now, that's what it's like here. You get recognized
everywhere you go. People understand it here, and they know their
baseball. New York fans are true baseball fans, they absolutely
love it. They got a taste of that up here, and hopefully it's just
going to get better with the new stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Baerga saw what happened in Cleveland after the Indians moved
into Jacobs Field in 1994. The Tribe has made the playoffs every
season and sold out more than 300 games in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a new life for this team, this city and for
everything around it commercially,'' Baerga said. ``It happened in
Cleveland. Cleveland was nothing before they built that ballpark.
That ballpark was the best thing that ever happened there.''
</P>
<P>
   Safeco Field, Baerga said, ``is like a gift on Christmas. You
love it and you can't stop playing with it. I think the fans here
in Seattle are going to have something to love for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   GWYNN SCRATCHED: Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn was in the
original lineup for Thursday night's game, batting second and
playing designated hitter. But Gwynn's strained left calf, which
has kept him out of action since June 19, stiffened up on him
during warm-ups Thursday. He was available for pinch hitting.
</P>
<P>
   THERE AT THE START: In 1992, Padres broadcaster Rick Sutcliffe
threw the first pitch at the ballpark that started baseball's
stadium craze, Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Months
before that game, when he visited the unfinished park as a free
agent, Sutcliffe realized he was seeing the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked down the left-field line, and it reminded me a little
bit of Shea Stadium,'' Sutcliffe said. ``I looked above the
first-base dugouts, saw the rafters and that reminded me of Wrigley
Field. Everywhere I looked, it reminded me of old-time ballparks _
and yet, everything was new. That ballpark was not built for
baseball players; it was built for the fans. And I sense it's the
same way with the ballpark here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutcliffe also is a former teammate of Jamie Moyer, who threw
the first pitch at Safeco Field Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to keep it as normal as possible, but it's not
possible,'' Sutcliffe said. ``The first pitch is always messed up.
Normally you try to throw it down the middle, but here, you want to
put it on the outside corner or miss outside. The last thing you
want to do is give up a hit on the first pitch in a new park.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, you know you're going to get a little more
leeway from the umpire. The crowd's on its feet, and they want to
see that right arm go up for strike one.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer indeed threw a called strike one.
</P>
<P>
   GREAT TIMING: Ozzie Timmons woke up at 4:40 a.m. Thursday, a few
hours after going 1 for 4 at the Triple-A All-Star Game at Zephyr
Field in New Orleans. He had no clue he'd be in Safeco Field
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   When he got off the plane, Timmons saw Greg Hunter, the Mariners
assistant farm director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was here to pick up some media guys from Tacoma.
I almost walked right past him,'' Timmons said.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing he didn't. Hunter was there to tell Timmons he'd been
called up to Seattle, the result of injuries to Charles Gipson and
Brian Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a thrill to get called up,'' said Timmons, an
outfielder who was batting .273 with 21 homers and 66 RBIs for
Tacoma. ``And then to find out it was opening day of a new stadium,
that was great, too. This is a beautiful place.''
</P>
<P>
   A career National Leaguer, Timmons last played in the majors for
Cincinnati in 1997, a year before Bank One Ballpark opened in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ALL NERVES: Jordan Zimmerman didn't play in the All-Star Game
Tuesday. But it sure felt like he did.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman, the Mariners' rookie left-hander, watched from his
Seattle apartment as brother Jeff of the Texas Rangers hurled a
scoreless seventh inning for the American League. It wasn't easy
for Jeff _ or Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he walked that first guy, I could not watch,'' Jordan
said. ``I closed my eyes and asked my wife to give me the
play-by-play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wasn't nervous, but I know he was. You could see
him shaking out there; I would be, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is getting one souvenir from his brother _ an All-Star
cap with Jeff's signature stitched to the side. But you won't catch
Jordan wearing it around Safeco Field. The hat has a Rangers logo
in front.

A WALK IN THE PARK: M'S LOSE SAFECO FIELD OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It was not supposed to happen like this. This was a
day for streamers from the rafters, for a dreamy Kinsella recital,
for the heavens to watch a major league baseball game in Seattle
for the first time in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   New beginning. Old nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   For everything the Mariners changed when they moved to Safeco
Field Thursday night, they kept the same bullpen they had in the
Kingdome. Closer Jose Mesa, brought in to save a come-from-behind
thriller, walked four of the five San Diego Padres he faced. It
doomed the Mariners to a 3-2 loss before 44,607 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has lost six in a row and is in sole possession of last
place for the first time since April.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 1-0 with two outs in the bottom of the eighth, the
Mariners offense awoke. Dan Wilson doubled off the wall in right
field. David Bell doubled down the third-base line _ his third of
the game _ to tie the score. David Segui rifled an opposite-field
double to right, bringing in Bell to give the M's a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then, disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa, pitching for the first time since last Wednesday in
Anaheim, came in to relieve Jamie Moyer, who allowed one run and
struck out nine in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa walked leadoff hitter Ruben Rivera, who stole second.
Pinch-hitters John Vander Wal and Ed Giovanola then walked,
prompting a mound visit by Lou Piniella. The Mariners manager
stayed with Mesa, drawing the first sustained booing in Safeco
Field history. Mesa rewarded Piniella for one hitter, striking out
Dave Magadan.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa fell behind Quilvio Veras, 2-and-0, then got a called
strike and a foul ball. His 2-2 pitch missed down and in, and the
full-count pitch missed to the same spot. Veras flipped his bat,
skipped to first, the tying run came in and Mesa came out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my closer,'' Piniella said. ``I thought he had a better
chance of striking them out than (Paul) Abbott. What can I say?
It's a shame the way we lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella called on Abbott, the hottest hand in the bullpen
lately, and Eric Owens lofted his first pitch to right. The
returning Jay Buhner gave chase, dropping the ball after he crossed
into foul territory. Heady move: had Buhner caught it, Vander Wal
almost surely would have tagged up and scored.
</P>
<P>
   He ended up doing so anyway. Owens lined out to Butch Huskey in
left, bringing in the go-ahead run. After Reggie Sanders grounded
into a force out to end the inning, the Padres had scored the tying
and go-ahead runs without getting a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Jose's out there doing his darndest,'' Moyer said.
``He's not trying to throw the game away. ... It's frustrating, but
I feel for the guy. I'm not upset at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the game, one threatening forecast held true, and
another held off. As predicted, the ball didn't have the same carry
at Safeco Field as it did across the street. Ken Griffey Jr. sliced
a fly ball to the left-center field gap in his first at bat, and
the crowd gasped. Griffey had homered to that spot in his first at
bat in the Kingdome. He had hit the last Kingdome home run, and 196
others there over the years.
</P>
<P>
   But this ball reached only the warning track, where Owens caught
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball that Junior hit to left-center field, that might have
been out in the Kingdome,'' Moyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The other forecast called for rain. When it never came, it made
for the greatest slide in this town's history when the ballpark's
roof slid open an hour before Moyer's first-pitch strike.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego scored its only run off Moyer in the third inning,
when DH Phil Nevin's two-out grounder hopped over the glove of
third baseman Russ Davis, bringing in Veras with the ballpark's
first run. Veras had led off the inning with a single and advanced
to second when an off-balance Moyer shoveled Owens' sacrifice bunt
from his glove to Segui's at first.
</P>
<P>
   Owens was batting second in place of future Hall of Famer Tony
Gwynn, whose calf strain kept him out Thursday night and has him
listed as doubtful for Friday night's game. Owens singled to right
field in the first inning for Safeco Field's first hit.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's leadoff double to left was the M's first hit, but fly
outs by Segui and Griffey and a strikeout by Alex Rodriguez
stranded him at second.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey doubled to lead off the ``Louie, Louie'' inning (it's
still played at stretch time), and went to third on Rodriguez's
ground out. Edgar Martinez then struck out, and Buhner _ playing
for the first time in nearly two months _ grounded to second
baseman Veras, who ranged to his right, fell to his knees for the
ball, and threw Buhner out to end the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego moved above .500 with the win. The Mariners, who went
quietly in the ninth inning against Dan Miceli, the Padres'
emergency closer because Trevor Hoffman is sick, slipped to four
under. The Padres heard those boos in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the way things have gone since we've been playing
well lately,'' said Nevin. ``(Mesa) is one of the best closers in
the game. Our hitters were just good at making him throw the ball.
No one's gonna be perfect all the time. The fans here need to
remember that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariner fans have years of memories of bullpen failures.
Thursday night, they got their first on the other side of Royal
Brougham Way.

FIRST NIGHT PLAYED TO PERFECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ No heartstring went unplucked Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   From the baserunning of the 5-year-old grandson of Fred
Hutchinson to the ceremonial first pitch from teary-eyed Dave
Niehaus, over the sounds of the Seattle Symphony and under a sky
free of concrete, the new ballpark swung on and belted.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's commissioner, Bud Selig, was even imported to do what
he does best _ in launching a passionate, eloquent pre-game defense
of the Mariners owners' audacious tax-money plot, he justified the
unjustifiable.
</P>
<P>
   All the way around, a vivid evening for the 44,607 brave outdoor
baseball pioneers, even if the overwhelmed concession lines were
longer than in the Kingdome's worst day. So alive was the Guilty
Pleasure that the alert fan could come away with souvenir smudge of
wet green paint (just add the cleaning bill to the cost overruns).
</P>
<P>
   Far as I could tell, only one important thing was missing: the
statue at the main entrance of Marcel Lachemann, without whom
Seattle's leap into Rolls Royce baseball would not have been
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Lachemann wasn't exactly a central figure, but he was symbolic.
After all, it wouldn't very well do to have a statue of the entire
1995 California Angels at the threshold of baseball's most
grandiose extravagance.
</P>
<P>
   So a figure of their beleaguered manager, slightly stooped and
face in hands, would capture all the poignant irony.
</P>
<P>
   Had his Angels not fallen from a 13-game lead, one of the most
ghastly swoons in baseball history, to allow the Mariners into the
1995 playoffs, the local nine likely would have been without the
baseball momentum that built the $517 million colossus now dividing
trains from ships in downtown's industrial flats.
</P>
<P>
   Though much has been made, justifiably, of the political,
financial and psychological derring-do that beat the astounding
odds, fact is that the fundamental most vital to creating the park
was winning baseball.
</P>
<P>
   So it is no surprise that the requirement for sustaining the
park and its monumental investment is the same.
</P>
<P>
   Without a thriving ballclub, the Guilty Pleasure is merely an
epic pile of steel and concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Splendid as was the inauguration of gray, blue and black skies
and green grass into the local sporting consciousness, the Mariners
still lost their sixth in a row with yet another bullpen
disintegration.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the Mariners crossed Royal Brougham Way with all
their baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Difference is, after the 3-2 loss to the San Diego Padres, the
newly audible train whistles seemed mournful. Also perhaps fateful.
Losing reliever Jose Mesa, who walked four to allow the
game-deciding runs in the ninth, needs to know that Burlington
Northern's nightly 10:05 chugging behind the stadium usually has a
few empty box cars.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, with the offense having scored six runs in the past
four games, Mesa could have any number of teammates to keep him
warm in the open car.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' skid at such a moment in civic sports history
points up a grim baseball first: The team is nowhere near as good
as its house. But don't feel any extra pressure, guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I hadn't even thought of that,'' said Edgar
Martinez, echoing the sentiment of several teammates.
</P>
<P>
   One of the virtues of great players is the ability to be
unreflective. This is, after all, mostly a game of see-ball,
hit-ball, catch-ball. It's just as well that the players don't
ponder the psychological tonnage that comes with the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play the game, regardless,'' Ken Griffey Jr. said. ``What
else do you want me to do?''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners folks who are paid to be reflective are management
and ownership, a bunch who lately have seemed a little light on the
virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Mariners president Chuck Armstrong paused long
enough in the frenzy of his dream-come-true to reluctantly ponder
the implications of putting out a team that matches what the
taxpayers have put out for the yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard some of that sentiment, so maybe that's there,'' he
said. ``Consciously or subconsciously, maybe it's a part of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Though asserting the usual platitudes about ownership's
commitment to winning, Armstrong acknowledged that because of lower
Kingdome attendance in the season's first half, the team is behind
the 1999 business plan to break even. He estimated the move to the
new field will generate $8 million to $10 million in additional
revenue this year, ``although we'd like not to spend it all on
player payroll. We don't want to go hog wild.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like something less than a resounding call to
baseball arms. Probably not a surprise for a franchise whose most
enduring, compelling figure is their broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there were a citizenry and a fan base deserving of a
William Wallace-like call to the castlemounts, it is one that just
spent $517 million for the castle on the night the team fell into
the basement of the smallest division in the major leagues.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Can a revolution, as rigorous and all-encompassing as Iran's, be
civilized step by step?
</P>
<P>
   President Muhammad Khatami, with his ambition to impose a
``civil society'' on the country's Islamic framework, has been
endeavoring to do just that. All too often his progress is two
steps back for each one forward.
</P>
<P>
   His is undoubtedly a government of good intentions. But he is
trapped between the frustrated, impatient young _ 60 percent of
today's Iranians were toddlers or not yet born at the time of the
1979 Islamic takeover _ who urge him to race ahead, and
conservative clerical overlords who wait watchfully to trip him up,
and more often than not succeed in doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Iran's audacious students battling in the streets
against the authorities in the most open act of political defiance
since the earliest years of the Islamic republic, the future of
Khatami's gentle reforms are in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The students' challenge began as a limited protest against a law
that set out to reverse the relative press freedom that is the
reformist government's one tangible achievement.
</P>
<P>
   This was one reverse too far: Iran's young cherish a packet of
grievances, ranging from the acute shortage of jobs to the social
restrictions that ban most boy-and-girl outings.
</P>
<P>
   Restrictive though it is, the system allows discussion of these
complaints, and many niggling rules have been quietly eased since
Khatami took over.
</P>
<P>
   But after the police and their allies, the Islamist bully-boy
militia, raided dormitories in Tehran University, killing at least
one student and probably more, the shout for change began to
penetrate out-of-bounds areas.
</P>
<P>
   The students started to call for fundamental reforms,
questioning the legitimacy of clerical control. They even, albeit
tentatively, challenged the sacrosanct heart of Iran's Islamist
edifice, the ultimate authority of the ``supreme leader.''
</P>
<P>
   So bold an assault on their bastions of power was intolerable to
the clerics, not excluding Khatami, who is scrupulous about
operating within the system.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, however different their visions of an Islamic society,
the president has been careful to work closely with Ali Khamenei,
the ayatollah who succeeded Khomeini as supreme leader in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to calm the hotheads, he could do little but plead for
the law to be respected. The students were told to stay off the
streets, an order many of them disobeyed. The result on Tuesday,
the sixth day of protest, was chaos in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Students rampaged through the city, burning tires and throwing
stones. They were met by the police, shooting in the air and firing
tear gas, plus the ever-present and far less temperate vigilantes.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ayatollah Khamenei and Khatami denounced the rioters,
claiming they had little to do with the original student protest:
the ayatollah added chillingly that the Basij, the Islamic militia,
had his full support ``to intimidate and crush'' the enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The latest crackdown is by no means the first suppression of
civilian protest in the past ten years. It is, however, the first
time that the security services have taken on any group as
articulate and well-connected as the country's students.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian students, who now number over a million, showed their
muscle 20 years ago when their widespread demonstrations inside
Iran, and their energetic organizations outside, helped bring down
the shah and his secular regime.
</P>
<P>
   Could they bring down the Islamic regime? History is unlikely to
repeat itself quite like that. Iran's pre-revolutionary students
(many of whom were communist rather than Islamist or democratic)
were far better organized than the current lot.
</P>
<P>
   They had the determined aim of getting rid of the shah, his
corrupt entourage and his western ways and buddies. They were in
tune with many sections of the population, alienated from the shah
and his security apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, by the late 1970s, the shah's support had crumbled. He
had no solid base fighting to keep him in power.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, today's protesting students may dislike the firm
clerical framework of their state _ which shows no sign of
crumbling _ but most of them still support a government that they
enthusiastically helped to bring about through their votes for
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Their aims, therefore, are diffuse. They want many of the same
things that the president and his reformist ministers are
struggling for: more jobs, fewer petty rules, greater freedom of
expression, less interference with the electoral system and better
relations with the West, above all the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since they share many of its goals, their aim is not to
undermine, let alone get rid of, the government. Rather, they would
like to put fire in its belly.
</P>
<P>
   Will they succeed? The current protests share one quality with
the earlier ones: their unpredictability. The results in 1979 were
not what many of the protesters expected.
</P>
<P>
   As a new biography of Khomeini relates, the revolution was
hijacked by the ayatollah's unwavering determination to set up a
strict clerical state: revolutionaries with other aims found
themselves pushed aside.
</P>
<P>
   The students now fighting to get Khatami to accelerate change
could inadvertently bring about a conservative backlash that sweeps
away the power of a man who, despite all his caution, is suspected
by many clerical diehards of being an Iranian Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   The hope must be that, out of this week's incidents, he and the
students will both prevail, promoting reform that opens Iran to
genuine freedom and democracy. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Can a revolution, as rigorous and all-encompassing as Iran's, be
civilized step by step?
</P>
<P>
   President Muhammad Khatami, with his ambition to impose a
``civil society'' on the country's Islamic framework, has been
endeavoring to do just that. All too often his progress is two
steps back for each one forward.
</P>
<P>
   His is undoubtedly a government of good intentions. But he is
trapped between the frustrated, impatient young _ 60 percent of
today's Iranians were toddlers or not yet born at the time of the
1979 Islamic takeover _ who urge him to race ahead, and
conservative clerical overlords who wait watchfully to trip him up,
and more often than not succeed in doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Iran's audacious students battling in the streets
against the authorities in the most open act of political defiance
since the earliest years of the Islamic republic, the future of
Khatami's gentle reforms are in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The students' challenge began as a limited protest against a law
that set out to reverse the relative press freedom that is the
reformist government's one tangible achievement.
</P>
<P>
   This was one reverse too far: Iran's young cherish a packet of
grievances, ranging from the acute shortage of jobs to the social
restrictions that ban most boy-and-girl outings.
</P>
<P>
   Restrictive though it is, the system allows discussion of these
complaints, and many niggling rules have been quietly eased since
Khatami took over.
</P>
<P>
   But after the police and their allies, the Islamist bully-boy
militia, raided dormitories in Tehran University, killing at least
one student and probably more, the shout for change began to
penetrate out-of-bounds areas.
</P>
<P>
   The students started to call for fundamental reforms,
questioning the legitimacy of clerical control. They even, albeit
tentatively, challenged the sacrosanct heart of Iran's Islamist
edifice, the ultimate authority of the ``supreme leader.''
</P>
<P>
   So bold an assault on their bastions of power was intolerable to
the clerics, not excluding Khatami, who is scrupulous about
operating within the system.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, however different their visions of an Islamic society,
the president has been careful to work closely with Ali Khamenei,
the ayatollah who succeeded Khomeini as supreme leader in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to calm the hotheads, he could do little but plead for
the law to be respected. The students were told to stay off the
streets, an order many of them disobeyed. The result on Tuesday,
the sixth day of protest, was chaos in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Students rampaged through the city, burning tires and throwing
stones. They were met by the police, shooting in the air and firing
tear gas, plus the ever-present and far less temperate vigilantes.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ayatollah Khamenei and Khatami denounced the rioters,
claiming they had little to do with the original student protest:
the ayatollah added chillingly that the Basij, the Islamic militia,
had his full support ``to intimidate and crush'' the enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The latest crackdown is by no means the first suppression of
civilian protest in the past ten years. It is, however, the first
time that the security services have taken on any group as
articulate and well-connected as the country's students.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian students, who now number over a million, showed their
muscle 20 years ago when their widespread demonstrations inside
Iran, and their energetic organizations outside, helped bring down
the shah and his secular regime.
</P>
<P>
   Could they bring down the Islamic regime? History is unlikely to
repeat itself quite like that. Iran's pre-revolutionary students
(many of whom were communist rather than Islamist or democratic)
were far better organized than the current lot.
</P>
<P>
   They had the determined aim of getting rid of the shah, his
corrupt entourage and his western ways and buddies. They were in
tune with many sections of the population, alienated from the shah
and his security apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, by the late 1970s, the shah's support had crumbled. He
had no solid base fighting to keep him in power.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, today's protesting students may dislike the firm
clerical framework of their state _ which shows no sign of
crumbling _ but most of them still support a government that they
enthusiastically helped to bring about through their votes for
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Their aims, therefore, are diffuse. They want many of the same
things that the president and his reformist ministers are
struggling for: more jobs, fewer petty rules, greater freedom of
expression, less interference with the electoral system and better
relations with the West, above all the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since they share many of its goals, their aim is not to
undermine, let alone get rid of, the government. Rather, they would
like to put fire in its belly.
</P>
<P>
   Will they succeed? The current protests share one quality with
the earlier ones: their unpredictability. The results in 1979 were
not what many of the protesters expected.
</P>
<P>
   As a new biography of Khomeini relates, the revolution was
hijacked by the ayatollah's unwavering determination to set up a
strict clerical state: revolutionaries with other aims found
themselves pushed aside.
</P>
<P>
   The students now fighting to get Khatami to accelerate change
could inadvertently bring about a conservative backlash that sweeps
away the power of a man who, despite all his caution, is suspected
by many clerical diehards of being an Iranian Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   The hope must be that, out of this week's incidents, he and the
students will both prevail, promoting reform that opens Iran to
genuine freedom and democracy. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Big, deep, sophisticated, flexible: America's financial markets
are the envy of the world. For how much longer?
</P>
<P>
   Consider the mighty Treasury-bond market. This is the world's
biggest thanks mainly to the government's persistent inability to
balance the books. But now the Treasury is raking in huge
surpluses; President Bill Clinton has even claimed that the
government might pay off its debt by 2015. What on earth would bond
arbitrageurs do then?
</P>
<P>
   Thank heavens, there are plenty of reasons to doubt Clinton's
forecast. As other countries have found, surpluses have a magical
way of disappearing as soon as the politicians get to know about
them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if America's Treasury-bond market will not, after all,
disappear, might its stock market?
</P>
<P>
   America seems to be running out of shares. That may seem
surprising: what about all those extravagantly priced Internet
offers? They are small beer. Taken as a whole, American companies
are now buying back as much as 2 percent of their outstanding
equity every year.
</P>
<P>
   If that trend persists, in 50 years' time there would be
two-thirds fewer shares than there are now; and 100 years from now,
corporate America would be financed almost entirely by debt.
</P>
<P>
   A century may be rather longer than the average investor's time
horizon. However, the trend matters today.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, corporate America is hugely profitable: the
latest quarterly earnings reports, starting this week, will
probably be pretty good. But they should be treated with caution.
</P>
<P>
   If American companies continue to buy back their own shares,
anything that uses them as a denominator _ such as
earnings-per-share, or return on equity _ will automatically rise,
even if underlying profits are unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, buying back shares by issuing more debt means that
corporate America is becoming ever more exposed to risk.
</P>
<P>
   Their ability to borrow so much has a lot to do with lenders'
astonishingly generous attitudes to companies with apparently
overextended balance sheets. Yet even this does not solve the
fundamental riddle: why would companies buy something that is as
dear just now as their own shares?
</P>
<P>
   With equity as cheap to raise as it is, and interest rates
threatening to rise, it might make more sense to be selling shares
rather than buying them.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the riddle might lie in an innovation that has
often been touted as a savior of modern American capitalism, but
could yet turn out to be a false prophet: share options.
</P>
<P>
   These were supposed to align the interests of companies'
managers with those of shareholders by concentrating managers'
minds on profitability. They have not quite worked out that way.
Instead, many bosses have responded, entirely rationally, by trying
to sweat as much return in as short a time as they can manage from
as little equity as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, stock options have created a huge incentive for
firms' managers to borrow in order to buy back equity _ which is
not at all the same as looking after shareholders' long-term
interests.
</P>
<P>
   As well as raising fundamental questions about the ownership of
companies in the long term, corporate America's growing debt raises
concerns about their health in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, inadequate leverage is bad for shareholders, for too
much equity leads to meager returns. But too little equity could
also threaten a company's solvency when the economy sours.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt America's ever-sophisticated financial markets will be
ready to pick up the pieces. &QL;

<P>
   When Arizona became a state in 1912, the first man it sent to
the United States Senate was a loquacious cowboy called Henry
Fountain Ashurst. In his first address to the Senate, Ashurst
boasted that Arizona was ``poised to become a veritable paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two things were needed, he said: ``Water, and lots of good
people.'' According to legend, a senator from New England
responded, ``If the gentleman from Arizona will forgive me, that's
all they need in hell.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, it is Arizonans who are having the laugh. Their
state has been a huge success story in the second half of the 20th
century partly because it has honored Ashurst's first criterion for
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   It has built massive dams and irrigation projects, providing
enough water for a rapidly growing population. The 1990s have also
brought a booming high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Water, people, work: everything seems to be going Arizona's way.
The core of the state's spectacular growth is Phoenix, a capital
city brought to life from the unforgiving desert.
</P>
<P>
   Once home only to agrarian Indian tribes and copper prospectors,
Phoenix is now the fastest-growing city (among cities with a
population of 1 million or more) in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, according to recent Census Bureau data, its
population increased by 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many cities in the east whose population has dropped
during the decade as people have shifted to the suburbs, central
Phoenix has gained 200,000 new residents.
</P>
<P>
   But the suburbs have flourished, too; Mesa, Scottsdale and
Chandler have expanded so rapidly that the whole metropolitan area,
not just the city itself, sets a countrywide record.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors have fed this growth, apart from the general
demographic trend in favor of the southern and western states.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of big high-tech companies such as Motorola, Intel
and Honeywell has lured people in recent years, but long before
that a policy of limited government and few regulations pulled
businessmen into Phoenix. And Arizona recovered from the recession
of the early 1990s more quickly than its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   According to Marc Perry of the Census Bureau, much of the 1990s
migration to Phoenix comes from California, which lingered in
recession longer than the other western states.
</P>
<P>
   The migration to new jobs means that Phoenix's population has
remained relatively young. Retired people account for a much
smaller part of the population growth in Arizona than in other
retirement havens, such as Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The relative youth of Phoenix's newest inhabitants becomes clear
when you drive north from the center of town. Thousands of family
homes, in residential developments with names like Arrowhead Valley
and Citrus Creek, are being built for miles in every direction.
</P>
<P>
   So rapid a growth has inevitably bred controversy. As Phoenix
spreads farther into the desert, some city officials and
environmental groups think the sprawl will become unmanageable.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Bahr of the Sierra Club reckons that ``Phoenix is well on
its way to becoming Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, new construction is cutting into the Sonoran
Desert at the rate of an acre an hour. The ease with which new land
can be developed around Phoenix is partly due to geography: there
are no mountains or big lakes to place natural checks on growth.
</P>
<P>
   A more compelling reason, however, is the fierce anti-regulatory
strain in Arizona politics. The state legislature has shied away
from enforcing guidelines for urban development in the Phoenix
area. On the contrary, it has encouraged it by freeing most
developers from environmental-impact fees.
</P>
<P>
   The state's governor, Jane Hull, has set up a commission to
design regulations for future development, but there are doubts
that it will come up with anything enforceable.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Sierra Club's Bahr pins her hopes on a set of
strict regulations drafted by the club, which will be put to the
voters in November next year.
</P>
<P>
   If the city ever decides to set limits on its growth, it is
unlikely to be because of fears for the environment. There are
millions of untouched desert acres around Phoenix where new suburbs
could easily spring up. Most people think that the current water
system can cope with urban growth far into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their laissez-faire approach to life, Arizonans like the
nature they see around them. One day, the two things will clash.
But not yet, they reckon. &QL;

MO GIVES ANGELS WIN

 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It was one small step in the standings but one
giant leap for the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn's single off Onan Masaoka in the 10th inning scored
Randy Velarde from second base to give the Angels a 7-6 victory
over the Los Angeles Dodgers before a sellout crowd of 43,911
Thursday night at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the Angels' fifth in six games and allowed them
to move out of last place in the AL West for the first time since
May 25. They kept pace with the Texas Rangers, remaining 6{ games
back in the AL West and moving ahead of the Seattle Mariners, who
fell seven games out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big,'' Vaughn said. ``You come in a look at the standings
and see you're at the bottom. I've told people I haven't been in
last place in a lot of years. Getting over that hump is a big deal.
Now we've got to get over .500 and start moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Dodgers, the loss snapped their winning streak at four,
but because the Giants also lost, they remained 10 games back in
the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Petkovsek (9-2) pitched two scoreless innings in relief to
earn the victory and become the winningest pitcher on the Angels
staff. Alan Mills (2-2) got the loss for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Dodgers manager Davey Johnson would even pitch to
Vaughn in the 10th inning was curious. With Velarde on second base,
first base was open and Vaughn's run meant nothing. Also, Vaughn
went into the game hitting .393 vs. lefties, compared to .239
against right-handers. So it couldn't have come as a surprise to
many that Vaughn lined a 2-2 pitch past Mark Grudzielanek at short
and into left field, easily scoring Velarde for the Angels win.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, though, said he wasn't surprised the Dodgers pitched to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no outs, and you can't walk everybody,'' he said.
``The number of outs dictate how they're going to come at you. I've
been intentionally walked enough in this game and pitched around a
lot, so I've learned when to be aggressive and when not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Johnson: ``I was shooting craps out there. Leadoff double
with the middle of the lineup coming up. We were going to walk him
if we got behind, but we got two quick strikes. I was shooting
craps there. I don't feel good about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Angel Devon White's three-run homer off Angels starter
Chuck Finley gave the Dodgers their first lead of the night at 6-5
in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   White, who also had a double and two singles, is hitting .529 (9
for 17) with two homers and nine RBI in four games against the
Angels this season. His grand slam keyed a 7-4 win over the Angels
on June 5. But White's big hit didn't stand up because Pedro
Borbon, pitching in relief of starter Kevin Brown, couldn't hold
it.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde was happy to see Brown gone when he came up in the
seventh. After looking bad in three at-bats against Brown, striking
out twice, Velarde homered off Borbon, tying the game at 6. It also
increased Velarde's hitting streak to 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the happiest guy in the world when I saw (Brown) walk
off the field,'' Velarde said. ``I saw (Borbon) throw fastballs,
87-, 88-mph, batting- practice fastballs.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had their ace throwing, but neither Brown nor Finley
pitched like it. Brown gave up five runs and five hits in 51/3
innings, striking out six and walking three. Finley gave up six
runs and eight hits in five innings, striking out six and walking
four. Neither was involved in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Finley continues to struggle _ his ERA rose to 5.89
_ Angels manager Terry Collins hasn't lost faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to get back in this, Chuck Finley is going to
be one of the guys driving the bus,'' Collins said. ``When he gets
it going, we're going to hop on that big back and ride it for a
while.'' &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

<P>
   BERKELEY _ A street filled with angry protesters, shouts, chants
and songs through the night, the riot squad called in. It sounds
like a 35th birthday party for the Free Speech Movement, but what
is happening these days in Berkeley, the American capital of
protest politics, is quite serious.
</P>
<P>
   The city is embroiled in a dispute about the management of KPFA,
the oldest listener-sponsored radio station in the United States
and long the voice of Berkeley's far left.
</P>
<P>
   Not many years after KPFA was founded, in 1949, by a pacifist
called Lewis Hill, it became the first radio station to broadcast a
reading of Allen Ginsberg's ``Howl.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s it broadcast live coverage of Berkeley's famous
marches and demonstrations, including the Free Speech Movement
sit-ins, Black Panther trials and the battle over People's Park.
</P>
<P>
   It was on a tape first broadcast on KPFA that Patty Hearst, the
kidnapped heiress of the newspaper empire, announced her conversion
to her captors' views and called her parents ``capitalist pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   But KPFA is not its own boss. It is part of a stable of five
major FM stations owned and operated by the Pacifica Radio
Foundation; the others are WBAI in New York City, KPFK in Los
Angeles, WPFW in Washington, and KPFT in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the present row. Last March, Pacifica's executive
director, Lynn Chadwick, refused to renew the contract of Nicole
Sawaya, KPFA's station manager, saying she ``was not a team
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, KPFA broadcast a report of Sawaya's sacking,
calling it a ``power grab'' by the network. This brought
retribution from Pacifica.
</P>
<P>
   Other KPFA journalists were sacked for discussing the matter,
and on July 13 Dennis Bernstein, the news director, was physically
dragged off the air for mentioning it. It made riveting listening.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the KPFA partisans realize it or not, the problems
facing their favorite radio station are the tip of a very large
iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Pacifica network has become the only real
``alternative'' network left in American radio. Programs
distributed by National Public Radio, by far the largest network of
listener-supported (or ``public'') radio stations in the country,
have grown increasingly bland.
</P>
<P>
   NPR's most popular show _ after two drive-time news programs _
is ``Car Talk,'' a call-in program featuring two voluble brothers
who dispense in equal parts mechanical and ``relationship'' advice.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the FM and AM radio dials are crowded with
commercial stations, providing a rarely-varying roar of rock,
country &AMP; western, ``oldies,'' talk and rap.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Pacifica's most popular network program is
``Democracy Now!,'' a daily hour-long feature that won an award
earlier this year for its coverage of massacres in oil-rich regions
of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   But if Pacifica's programming has remained defiantly the same,
its potential audience has been changing, especially in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Latinos, Asians and South Americans in the region
has grown markedly, while the white population has declined.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of California's Berkeley campus, white,
middle-class radicals have long since been supplanted by diligent
middle-class students, largely of Asian descent.
</P>
<P>
   All the more bizarre, then, that KPFA _ which has the signal and
the power to reach 6.5 million listeners in the greater Bay Area _
has an audience of about 200,000 who are mostly white, male and
over 50.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Pacifica Radio Foundation, Mary Frances
Berry _ a black woman who marched with Martin Luther King, who also
happens to be the head of the federal Civil Rights Commission _ is
keen to shift Pacifica's focus away from radicalism towards the
interests of ethnic minorities, which also often go unheard.
</P>
<P>
   It would certainly make sense in San Francisco, but others fear
_ rightly _ that the attempt to reach new listeners will inevitably
dilute the one remaining voice of the far left. &QL;

   BERKELEY _ A street filled with angry protesters, shouts, chants
and songs through the night, the riot squad called in. It sounds
like a 35th birthday party for the Free Speech Movement, but what
is happening these days in Berkeley, the American capital of
protest politics, is quite serious.
</P>
<P>
   The city is embroiled in a dispute about the management of KPFA,
the oldest listener-sponsored radio station in the United States
and long the voice of Berkeley's far left.
</P>
<P>
   Not many years after KPFA was founded, in 1949, by a pacifist
called Lewis Hill, it became the first radio station to broadcast a
reading of Allen Ginsberg's ``Howl.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s it broadcast live coverage of Berkeley's famous
marches and demonstrations, including the Free Speech Movement
sit-ins, Black Panther trials and the battle over People's Park.
</P>
<P>
   It was on a tape first broadcast on KPFA that Patty Hearst, the
kidnapped heiress of the newspaper empire, announced her conversion
to her captors' views and called her parents ``capitalist pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   But KPFA is not its own boss. It is part of a stable of five
major FM stations owned and operated by the Pacifica Radio
Foundation; the others are WBAI in New York City, KPFK in Los
Angeles, WPFW in Washington, and KPFT in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the present row. Last March, Pacifica's executive
director, Lynn Chadwick, refused to renew the contract of Nicole
Sawaya, KPFA's station manager, saying she ``was not a team
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, KPFA broadcast a report of Sawaya's sacking,
calling it a ``power grab'' by the network. This brought
retribution from Pacifica.
</P>
<P>
   Other KPFA journalists were sacked for discussing the matter,
and on July 13 Dennis Bernstein, the news director, was physically
dragged off the air for mentioning it. It made riveting listening.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the KPFA partisans realize it or not, the problems
facing their favorite radio station are the tip of a very large
iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Pacifica network has become the only real
``alternative'' network left in American radio. Programs
distributed by National Public Radio, by far the largest network of
listener-supported (or ``public'') radio stations in the country,
have grown increasingly bland.
</P>
<P>
   NPR's most popular show _ after two drive-time news programs _
is ``Car Talk,'' a call-in program featuring two voluble brothers
who dispense in equal parts mechanical and ``relationship'' advice.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the FM and AM radio dials are crowded with
commercial stations, providing a rarely-varying roar of rock,
country &AMP; western, ``oldies,'' talk and rap.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Pacifica's most popular network program is
``Democracy Now!,'' a daily hour-long feature that won an award
earlier this year for its coverage of massacres in oil-rich regions
of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   But if Pacifica's programming has remained defiantly the same,
its potential audience has been changing, especially in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Latinos, Asians and South Americans in the region
has grown markedly, while the white population has declined.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of California's Berkeley campus, white,
middle-class radicals have long since been supplanted by diligent
middle-class students, largely of Asian descent.
</P>
<P>
   All the more bizarre, then, that KPFA _ which has the signal and
the power to reach 6.5 million listeners in the greater Bay Area _
has an audience of about 200,000 who are mostly white, male and
over 50.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Pacifica Radio Foundation, Mary Frances
Berry _ a black woman who marched with Martin Luther King, who also
happens to be the head of the federal Civil Rights Commission _ is
keen to shift Pacifica's focus away from radicalism towards the
interests of ethnic minorities, which also often go unheard.
</P>
<P>
   It would certainly make sense in San Francisco, but others fear
_ rightly _ that the attempt to reach new listeners will inevitably
dilute the one remaining voice of the far left. &QL;

   AUSTIN, TEXAS AND WASHINGTON, D.C. _ In his science-fiction
classic ``From Earth to the Moon,'' Jules Verne tells the tale of a
group of American entrepreneurs who had the crazed notion that it
was possible to send humans to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   After working out what size of cannon and how much gunpowder
would be needed to propel the capsule into space, all that remained
was to decide where the launch should occur.
</P>
<P>
   It was narrowed down to either Texas or Florida, inciting a
battle royal between the two states. Texans dismissed Florida as a
``wretched little strip of country''; Florida's representatives
decried Texas as a remote wasteland teeming with Mexican bandits.
</P>
<P>
   More than 130 years after Verne wrote his novel, the arguments
have become a bit more sophisticated and the stakes a bit more
serious in the battle over where to put the future hub of the
American space industry.
</P>
<P>
   Texas and Florida are currently the front-runners among 15
states pitching plans to aerospace manufacturers for futuristic
``spaceports'' in a bid to capture a slice of the burgeoning
commercial satellite market (expected to be worth $120 billion by
2010).
</P>
<P>
   The worldwide demand for Internet and cellular telephone service
has created the need for communications companies around the globe
to get hundreds of satellites into orbit as quickly and cheaply as
possible. The proposed spaceports are seen as one answer.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies are developing space vehicles that could take
off from a domestic spaceport and carry cargo into space with
almost the frequency of a jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the current Space Shuttle, these Reusable Launch Vehicles
(RLVs) would be able to go up and come down entirely under their
own power, making disposable fuel tanks and rocket boosters
unnecessary. The turnaround time between launches would thus be
dramatically cut.
</P>
<P>
   This would be an obvious boon to the commercial space industry,
which is expected to account for roughly 75 percent of all launches
ten years from now, with the government down to a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The jewel of the proposed RLVs, and the project the competing
states are most eager to land, is Lockheed Martin's VentureStar.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lockheed officials, VentureStar will be able to
take cargo into space at a tenth of the current cost, and could be
ready to fly every two or three days.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to commercial interest in the project, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has also indicated that
VentureStar could ultimately replace the Space Shuttle and become
the primary courier to the International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has put up most of the money for a VentureStar prototype
that will be ready for testing next year. If the tests are
successful, Lockheed will decide where to base the project among
the 15 competing states.
</P>
<P>
   It could begin operating by 2005, though many scientists think
RLVs will not really get off the ground for another 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The interested states have stepped up their efforts to reel in
VentureStar. State officials print glossy proposals and fly
Lockheed officials in helicopters over the proposed spaceport
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Wooing VentureStar has a special urgency for Florida, which has
seen money for Cape Canaveral dry up as companies have begun to buy
launch services from sites outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   According to Edward Ellegood, an official at the Spaceport
Florida Authority, losing VentureStar and other RLV projects could
bring the end of the space industry in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Jeb Bush and the Florida legislature were so alarmed by
the thought that they recently set aside millions of dollars to
improve the state's launch infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   This new influx of money could give Florida a leg up in the
space race, yet Tom Moser of the Texas Aerospace Commission will
not entertain such an idea.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in an office adorned with model spaceships, he argues
that the proposed Texas spaceport would neither depend on federal
money nor require the use of federal air space, two factors he
believes will entice aerospace companies that want to minimize
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   But other states would like a piece of the action, too. Since
the new RLVs will not discard any equipment after being launched,
it is no longer necessary to send them up from coastal sites.
Landlocked states like Montana, New Mexico and Nevada may also land
spaceport contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Those directing each state's efforts are quick to point out
that, even if they are unsuccessful with Lockheed's VentureStar,
there are several other RLV projects in the works that could give
them a stake in the new space industry.
</P>
<P>
   Kistler Aerospace and Space Access, two of Lockheed's rivals,
are also developing reusable spacecraft and are shopping around for
launch sites.
</P>
<P>
   With 1,700 satellites being prepared for launching over the next
decade, a state does not want to be left out of the multibillion
dollar market. &QL;

<P>
   CHICAGO _ While Americans' eyes have been happily fixed on a
rising stock market, another and glummer statistic has been
climbing longer and more steadily: the number of Americans behind
bars.
</P>
<P>
   The population of federal and state prisons and local jails has
climbed from 744,000 in 1985 to nearly 2 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If present incarceration rates stay constant, the Bureau of
Justice Statistics estimates that 5 percent of Americans will go to
prison at some point in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The states do not slam the door equally. The five states with
the most prisoners per 100,000 people are in the South: Louisiana,
Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the incarceration rate is 24 percent higher in the South
than in the West, the next highest region, and a whopping 60
percent higher than in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Why are Southerners packing so many more people into prisons? To
begin with, there is more violent crime to be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   The murder rate in the South is 8.4 per 100,000, compared with
6.8 in the West and 4.8 in the Northeast. And, when a criminal is
caught, he is more likely to see the inside of a jail in the South.
</P>
<P>
   According to the most recent Department of Justice data, 49
percent of convicted felons get prison time in the South compared
with 43 percent elsewhere in the country. The sentences are longer,
too: 84 months on average in the South, 59 months outside it.
</P>
<P>
   But enthusiasm for prisons may be waning. John DiIulio, a former
professor of public policy at Princeton University and one of the
most articulate proponents of the social benefits of locking up
criminals, has begun to argue that 2 million prisoners are enough.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks that spending on imprisonment may crowd out other ways
of reducing crime, such as better policing and drug rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Even some politicians have become less eager to lock people up.
In South Dakota, where the prison budget has climbed 33 percent
since 1997, legislators recently balked at the governor's proposal
to impose a mandatory 30-day jail sentence for any drug conviction.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Kansas recently imposed a minimum 11.5-year
sentence for a first conviction for methamphetamine manufacturing
and life imprisonment for the second offense.
</P>
<P>
   States that have locked up prisoners and thrown away the key, as
is the case with mandatory life sentences, have not seen their
highest costs yet.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Abadinsky, a professor of criminal justice at St. Xavier
University in Chicago, reckons that the price of keeping inmates
nearly doubles, on average, once they get past 50. &QL;

<P>
   CHICAGO _ While Americans' eyes have been happily fixed on a
rising stock market, another and glummer statistic has been
climbing longer and more steadily: the number of Americans behind
bars.
</P>
<P>
   The population of federal and state prisons and local jails has
climbed from 744,000 in 1985 to nearly 2 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If present incarceration rates stay constant, the Bureau of
Justice Statistics estimates that 5 percent of Americans will go to
prison at some point in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The states do not slam the door equally. The five states with
the most prisoners per 100,000 people are in the South: Louisiana,
Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the incarceration rate is 24 percent higher in the South
than in the West, the next highest region, and a whopping 60
percent higher than in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Why are Southerners packing so many more people into prisons? To
begin with, there is more violent crime to be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   The murder rate in the South is 8.4 per 100,000, compared with
6.8 in the West and 4.8 in the Northeast. And, when a criminal is
caught, he is more likely to see the inside of a jail in the South.
</P>
<P>
   According to the most recent Department of Justice data, 49
percent of convicted felons get prison time in the South compared
with 43 percent elsewhere in the country. The sentences are longer,
too: 84 months on average in the South, 59 months outside it.
</P>
<P>
   But enthusiasm for prisons may be waning. John DiIulio, a former
professor of public policy at Princeton University and one of the
most articulate proponents of the social benefits of locking up
criminals, has begun to argue that 2 million prisoners are enough.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks that spending on imprisonment may crowd out other ways
of reducing crime, such as better policing and drug rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Even some politicians have become less eager to lock people up.
In South Dakota, where the prison budget has climbed 33 percent
since 1997, legislators recently balked at the governor's proposal
to impose a mandatory 30-day jail sentence for any drug conviction.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Kansas recently imposed a minimum 11.5-year
sentence for a first conviction for methamphetamine manufacturing
and life imprisonment for the second offense.
</P>
<P>
   States that have locked up prisoners and thrown away the key, as
is the case with mandatory life sentences, have not seen their
highest costs yet.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Abadinsky, a professor of criminal justice at St. Xavier
University in Chicago, reckons that the price of keeping inmates
nearly doubles, on average, once they get past 50. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Its designers named Iridium after the 77th element in honor of
the 77 satellites that were to beam signals around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the mobile-telephone network uses only 66 satellites,
but Dysprosium, the 66th element, sounds more like an
antidepressant than a technological marvel. Which is fitting.
</P>
<P>
   On July 14 Iridium's shares tumbled 18 percent, to $6.75, on
news that Motorola, which has already ploughed $1.66 billion into
the venture, has vowed not to invest any more unless other
investors do so too.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year Iridium's shares have fallen by 89 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Little more than nine months since it opened for business, the
world's first mobile satellite-telephone service (MSS), may already
be doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Iridium's failings could tarnish the prospects of two
better-conceived rival services, Globalstar, which will be launched
later this year, and ICO, which will enter the market in August
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium's survival could depend upon whether Motorola's threats
can get its investors, bond-holders and creditors to agree on the
outlines of a financial restructuring before a deadline of August
11.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Iridium was due to make a $90 million bond payment
on July 15, though it has a 30-day grace period. If it misses the
payment or the haggling over restructuring drags on, the company
could file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Equally critical will be whether the 65 percent cut in the price
of calls, announced at the end of June, has increased the number of
subscribers from 10,000 at the end of March to the revised (though
still modest) target of 27,000 by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium is in a bind: investors won't put more money in until
they see that customers are interested, whereas customers won't buy
until they know the company has the financial backing to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium got itself into this mess astonishingly quickly. Were
its estimates of the MSS market _ between 32 million and 45 million
subscribers within ten years _ plain wrong? Or are Iridium's own
failings chiefly responsible?
</P>
<P>
   Iridium's assessment of the market still seems right. Mobile
telephony is going from strength to strength. In the next two
years, the number of subscribers worldwide is expected almost to
double to nearly 600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, such as Tom Watts of Merrill Lynch, a brokerage, think
the MSS providers should be able to grab about 2.5 percent of that
by offering handsets that will operate as both a land-based
cellular phone and a satellite telephone when cellular service is
unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   ICO's most recent market research, spanning 12 countries and
20,000 interviews, confirms earlier findings that if the price is
right, the demand will be there.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from continent-hopping business executives, niche markets
include long-haul truckers, civil engineers, field scientists,
disaster-relief agencies, news organizations, extractive industries
and geologists.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite telephones should also be useful in shipping and
aviation, as well as in less-developed countries that lack either
modern fixed-wire or wireless telephone infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Iridium has signed up pitifully few subscribers. Technology
gremlins are not to blame, despite the launch being delayed a month
or two by some software problems. Although they are complicated and
expensive, Iridium's low-earth orbiting satellites have worked
pretty much as billed.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem has been more prosaic: unimaginably bad
marketing. Well before Iridium was launched, there were concerns
that the company was in danger of setting its prices too high.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium's handsets cost more than $3,000 and call charges ranged
from $2 to $7 a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Staiano, Iridium's chief executive until he abruptly quit
in April, believed that by being the first MSS firm, Iridium could
charge a premium that would help pay for its over-budget $5 billion
platform.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the Iridium handset is an off-putting
brick 7 inches (18 centimeters) long, weighing 1 pound (450 grams).
</P>
<P>
   It poignantly recalls the pioneering days of mobile phones a
decade and a half ago. Even then Iridium's telephones were not
available in the modest numbers needed.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing delays at Motorola and Kyocera left customers
waiting until February to get their telephones. If they had been
supplied earlier, the firm's distribution partners would probably
not have been ready to sell them.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, an American long-distance carrier, will begin its first
promotional campaign soon _ a good ten months after Iridium's
launch; Telecom Italia, another lethargic distributor, is only now
training its sales force to sell the devices.
</P>
<P>
   An advertising campaign last year, costing $180 million, was
meant to bring in 500,000 customers by the end of March. Iridium's
new chief executive, a blunt Australian called John Richardson, now
describes its theme _ ``Calling Planet Earth'' _ as ``schmoozy and
generic'' lifestyle marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead Iridium should have aimed its message at those who
really need the service and given them lots of useful information.
</P>
<P>
   In the short-term, Iridium might salvage something. Its
satellites are flying, the service works reasonably, the new
tariffs are more realistic, the marketing will improve, and
cheaper, better handsets are on their way.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, still a problem. ICO, Iridium's rival,
calculates that, of the three MSS services, Iridium has by far the
highest costs.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that each system carries 1 billion minutes of calls a
year, the cost of a minute using Iridium's system is $1.28 compared
with 51 cents a minute for Globalstar and 35 cents for ICO.
</P>
<P>
   The difference arises mainly because Iridium's satellites are
both more numerous and use more power to maintain their low-earth
orbits. They will thus need replacing within five to seven years of
being launched.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, ICO's ten satellites fly about 9,000 kilometers
higher in medium-earth orbit and have a life span of 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   With its prices already far lower than it had planned for and
two lower-cost operators yet to enter the market, Iridium's future
is questionable, even if it can battle through its current
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Globalstar and ICO are crowing over Iridium's
difficulties. ICO, which went public last year, has seen its share
price driven down from $16.5 to $5 as the scale of the Iridium
debacle has become apparent.
</P>
<P>
   A rights issue intended to raise $500 million failed to reach
its target and has been extended to the end of July. ICO will
probably succeed in raising the money, but only at greater cost.
</P>
<P>
   And although even Iridium's Richardson admits that ``we cocked
it up,'' doubts about the size and value of the market for MSS will
inevitably linger until more subscribers begin to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody believes that $17 billion-worth of the latest satellites
will circle the globe ignored and in silence, but scarred investors
can be excused if, in future, they take little on trust. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Iridium got itself into this mess astonishingly quickly. Were
its estimates of the MSS market _ between 32 million and 45 million
subscribers within ten years _ plain wrong? Or are Iridium's own
failings chiefly responsible?
</P>
<P>
   Iridium's assessment of the market still seems right. Mobile
telephony is going from strength to strength. In the next two
years, the number of subscribers worldwide is expected almost to
double to nearly 600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, such as Tom Watts of Merrill Lynch, a brokerage, think
the MSS providers should be able to grab about 2.5 percent of that
by offering handsets that will operate as both a land-based
cellular phone and a satellite telephone when cellular service is
unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   ICO's most recent market research, spanning 12 countries and
20,000 interviews, confirms earlier findings that if the price is
right, the demand will be there.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from continent-hopping business executives, niche markets
include long-haul truckers, civil engineers, field scientists,
disaster-relief agencies, news organizations, extractive industries
and geologists.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite telephones should also be useful in shipping and
aviation, as well as in less-developed countries that lack either
modern fixed-wire or wireless telephone infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Iridium has signed up pitifully few subscribers. Technology
gremlins are not to blame, despite the launch being delayed a month
or two by some software problems. Although they are complicated and
expensive, Iridium's low-earth orbiting satellites have worked
pretty much as billed.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem has been more prosaic: unimaginably bad
marketing. Well before Iridium was launched, there were concerns
that the company was in danger of setting its prices too high.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium's handsets cost more than $3,000 and call charges ranged
from $2 to $7 a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Staiano, Iridium's chief executive until he abruptly quit
in April, believed that by being the first MSS firm, Iridium could
charge a premium that would help pay for its over-budget $5 billion
platform.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the Iridium handset is an off-putting
brick 7 inches (18 centimeters) long, weighing 1 pound (450 grams).
</P>
<P>
   It poignantly recalls the pioneering days of mobile phones a
decade and a half ago. Even then Iridium's telephones were not
available in the modest numbers needed.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing delays at Motorola and Kyocera left customers
waiting until February to get their telephones. If they had been
supplied earlier, the firm's distribution partners would probably
not have been ready to sell them.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, an American long-distance carrier, will begin its first
promotional campaign soon _ a good ten months after Iridium's
launch; Telecom Italia, another lethargic distributor, is only now
training its sales force to sell the devices.
</P>
<P>
   An advertising campaign last year, costing $180 million, was
meant to bring in 500,000 customers by the end of March. Iridium's
new chief executive, a blunt Australian called John Richardson, now
describes its theme _ ``Calling Planet Earth'' _ as ``schmoozy and
generic'' lifestyle marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead Iridium should have aimed its message at those who
really need the service and given them lots of useful information.
</P>
<P>
   In the short-term, Iridium might salvage something. Its
satellites are flying, the service works reasonably, the new
tariffs are more realistic, the marketing will improve, and
cheaper, better handsets are on their way.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, still a problem. ICO, Iridium's rival,
calculates that, of the three MSS services, Iridium has by far the
highest costs.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that each system carries 1 billion minutes of calls a
year, the cost of a minute using Iridium's system is $1.28 compared
with 51 cents a minute for Globalstar and 35 cents for ICO.
</P>
<P>
   The difference arises mainly because Iridium's satellites are
both more numerous and use more power to maintain their low-earth
orbits. They will thus need replacing within five to seven years of
being launched.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, ICO's ten satellites fly about 9,000 kilometers
higher in medium-earth orbit and have a life span of 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   With its prices already far lower than it had planned for and
two lower-cost operators yet to enter the market, Iridium's future
is questionable, even if it can battle through its current
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Globalstar and ICO are crowing over Iridium's
difficulties. ICO, which went public last year, has seen its share
price driven down from $16.5 to $5 as the scale of the Iridium
debacle has become apparent.
</P>
<P>
   A rights issue intended to raise $500 million failed to reach
its target and has been extended to the end of July. ICO will
probably succeed in raising the money, but only at greater cost.
</P>
<P>
   And although even Iridium's Richardson admits that ``we cocked
it up,'' doubts about the size and value of the market for MSS will
inevitably linger until more subscribers begin to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody believes that $17 billion-worth of the latest satellites
will circle the globe ignored and in silence, but scarred investors
can be excused if, in future, they take little on trust. &QL;

MICROSCOPIC SWITCH COULD SHRINK COMPUTERS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In what could be a big step toward making
computers faster and smaller than ever, layers of individual
molecules have been forged into tiny computer switches, scientists
announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers plan to assemble these switches and other diminutive
components into futuristic devices called ``chemically assembled
electronic nanocomputers,'' or CAENs _ machines that would be
billions of times more powerful than today's personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to use chemistry and clever software to overcome the
inherent limits of current computer-building methods. Experts say
that while many strategies are being tried, none has proved
successful so far.
</P>
<P>
   The latest results, reported Friday in the journal Science, are
``a step in the right direction,'' said Ray Muriella, director of
microtechnology at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another route to further miniaturization of logic, which
is something people have been fretting about for at least 10
years,'' Muriella said.
</P>
<P>
   The new switches are the handiwork of computer scientists and
chemists at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories in Palo Alto, Calif., and
at the University of California at Los Angeles. Their goal is to
get the first CAEN components up and running within two years.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting their latest experimental results, scientists showed
how a synthetic ``electronically active'' molecule called rotaxane
could function as a binary switch when suspended between
electrodes.
</P>
<P>
   Such a switch is a device capable of being in either of two
positions, which gives rise to the rudimentary elements of computer
logic. The Hewlett-Packard and UCLA team showed how it is possible
to configure the switches into what are known as ``logic gates''
signifying either ``and'' or ``or.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans envision wiring such logic gates into a radically
different type of computer architecture, based on what is called a
``defect-tolerant'' design amenable to commercial production.
</P>
<P>
   By designing molecules that function as electronic components,
chemists can cook up submicroscopic computer parts by the
beakerful. It would then be a fairly simple matter to spread the
parts in a thin film onto wafers of silicon.
</P>
<P>
   The result would be a sort of mess by design, the framework for
what the experts call ``electronically configurable'' logic.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to use software and scanning techniques to analyze
each chip after it has been coated with the molecular components
and tiny wires.
</P>
<P>
   The software searches out the functional switches and wires,
bypassing the defective ones, until a complete circuit is created.
It works only when there are plenty of alternative pathways and
redundant switches to start out.
</P>
<P>
   Experts liken it to the natural process in which the brain makes
complex neurological circuits from a seemingly haphazard patchwork,
tapping some nerve cells while ignoring others as the need arises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came up with a way to make a lattice of wires and switches,
then electronically configure those resources into something that
can do a computational task for you,'' said UCLA chemist James
Heath.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme sidesteps the manufacturing problems posed by
super-small printed circuitry using conventional methods. Although
bacteria-sized computers are still a long way off, the new methods
may be capable of building computer microcircuits much more compact
than is now possible, and for much lower manufacturing costs,
because the software takes care of fixing the defects after the
chips are built.
</P>
<P>
   Before the new assembly scheme could get past square one,
however, the computer scientists first had to show that a workable
switch could be produced in a chemistry lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the part of the project that had the greatest risk
and made us the most nervous,'' said Philip Kuekes, a computer
architect at Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are conducting experiments in an effort to make
the wires smaller. Those used in the new switch are conventional
metal wires, many times thicker than the smallest carbon-based
``nanotube'' wires now available.
</P>
<P>
   These metallic carbon tubes can be stretched into long strands
as thin as a single nanometer _ just a billionth of a meter, a
dimension used to measure atoms and viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by their progress so far, the Hewlett-Packard and
UCLA researchers said they are confident that the first CAEN
prototype will be completed by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a clear line of sight now to do it,'' said UCLA
chemist Heath.
</P>
<P>
   One problem yet to be solved is how to make switches that can be
set and reset repeatedly. The rotax-ane molecules used in the
experiments can only be set once, meaning they could be used for
making ``read-only memory,'' known as ROM, but not the more common
``random access memory,'' or RAM.
</P>
<P>
   Even if such technical problems can be solved within the
two-year schedule, the first machine will be nothing special
compared with the capabilities of the average desktop computers now
being sold. The researchers said all they intend to do initially is
produce a functioning prototype, capable of performing simple
arithmetic functions, to demonstrate the potential of the new
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of this prototype venture is expected to be an
assembly of two to five logic gates within a space no bigger than
about 200 nanometers.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate goals are much more ambitious miniature
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed this week at Hewlett-Packard's Palo Alto campus,
Kuekes predicted computer components so small and inexpensive they
could be mixed like pigment into paint or embedded in virtually any
device that could benefit from so-called smart capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, researchers are still struggling to perfect the
essential building blocks _ electronic components and wires far too
small to be produced effectively using straightforward
manufacturing methods and standard quality control.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA and Hewlett-Packard team used synthetic, Y-shaped
molecules of a substance called rotaxane, sandwiched in a
single-molecule-thick layer between lattices of ordinary metallic
wires.
</P>
<P>
   One of the arms of the ``Y'' has a ring-shaped structure looped
around it like a doughnut on a stick. The switch capabilities
derive from current-induced changes in the position of the
doughnut.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the molecule is held between two wires in such a way
that a current can flow only if the molecule provides a platform
for the moving electrons. The electrons have to jump first onto a
rotaxane molecule to get across, a move Heath likened to a hiker
stepping onto a stone to get across a river.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a stone is there, the switch is closed, so the electrons
can hop and current flows,'' he explained.

 CHEVRON WINS VARIANCE TO SELL LESS-CLEAN GAS  &HT;     By REBECCA SMITH 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In an unprecedented move, the California Air
Resources Board Thursday granted Chevron permission to sell
gasoline that violates the strict environmental guidelines of a
1996 state law.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron petitioned the agency late Tuesday for an emergency
variance, arguing that an explosion Saturday at its Richmond
refinery had slashed gasoline production to only 30 percent of the
normal amount.
</P>
<P>
   Without the waiver, Chevron said the state would experience a
gasoline shortage that would drive prices up sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law requires refiners in California to produce a
special formula gasoline that is less polluting. The variance
represents the first time an oil company has asked for and
succeeded in getting that law set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Critics fear other refineries might use this decision as
precedent in the event they face production problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Jerry Martin, a spokesman for the air board, said, ``The
variance was granted to avoid a supply disruption'' that could push
gas prices up.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Thursday's variance, Chevron now can import and sell
up to 3.5 million barrels of gasoline that meet federal, not state,
standards and sell them during a 45-day period.
</P>
<P>
   By law, Chevron would be required to pay 15 cents into an
environmental fund for each gallon of non-CARB gasoline sold. If it
sells the full amount allowed, some $22 million will flow into a
fund and will be used to get older, more-polluting vehicles off the
roads.
</P>
<P>
   Without the variance, Chevron said it would have had to reduce
gasoline deliveries to its service stations by the middle of next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental advocates reacted angrily to the variance which
they said rewards Chevron for bad management. They also said they
were mad that less than 24 hours elapsed between the time Chevron
filed its emergency petition and when the agency conducted its
public hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state not only is allowing Chevron to profit from being an
unsafe refinery operator, but they've allowed themselves to be
pushed into this decision without allowing the public time to
react,'' said Denny Larson, director of the nonprofit group,
Communities for a Better Environment in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are mad as hell and we think everyone in California should
be,'' he continued. ``It sets a terrible precedent, especially
considering how often California seems to have refinery
explosions.''
</P>
<P>
   For economists, the question is not whether gasoline prices will
rise _ they already are rising _ but whether the additional supply
will do enough to ease the shortage and push prices back down, said
Severin Borenstein, head of the Energy Institute at University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the next couple of weeks, we'll see prices going up,''
said Borenstein. ``What the Air Resources Board does won't stop
that because there's already been a supply disruption. And one
problem with prices going up is that there's a certain stickiness
that hinders their coming back down again.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether Chevron will pass the 15-cent-a-gallon
surcharge along to motorists. It's also possible other vendors,
whose wholesale prices also are rising, could raise gasoline prices
to match Chevron's.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion at the Richmond refinery already has had an impact
on the commodities market. Gasoline prices on the New York
Mercantile Exchange with an August delivery date rose 2.18 cents
Thursday, or 3.7 percent, to 61.7 cents a gallon. That's the
biggest increase since March 26 and the highest closing price in 21
months.
</P>
<P>
   The Richmond refinery is important to California gasoline
supplies because it produces more than 10 percent of the state's
cleaner-burning gasoline. Its troubles have cost the state 8
percent of its supply overnight.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second major problem at the refinery this year.
</P>
<P>
   An explosion and fire at the refinery last March temporarily
slashed production. The oil giant was able to make up for all but
15 percent of the normal refining production by buying partly
refined fuel elsewhere that it could finish refining.
</P>
<P>
   It had hoped to return the refinery to full production this
summer, but on Friday workers discovered a leak in a steam
generator. On Saturday, that leak led to a natural gas explosion
which rocked an electrostatic precipitator, a piece of equipment
that cleans particles from flue gas before it is exhausted into the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   There were no injuries but the refinery's production capacity
got knocked back to 30 percent of the normal 240,000 barrels of
crude a day.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Air Resources chief Michael Kenny, who granted
Thursday's emergency variance, Chevron said it will take several
weeks to get the precipitator back to half-operation and several
months to regain full use of the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Summer is the peak driving season, which means there isn't a lot
of excess inventory that can be tapped to make up for the
shortfall. That's why Chevron proposed that it be allowed to go
outside the state, most likely to the Gulf states, to obtain
substitute gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron told Kenny that gasoline inventories, in the Western
region, slid to 26.9 million barrels in early July. That's close to
a five-year low.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's hearing, there was only limited opposition to the
variance, but that could be because many groups were unaware of the
explosion, the variance request or the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not happy about Chevron's request because it sets a bad
precedent,'' said Roland Hwang, transportation director for the
Union of Concerned Scientists. ``It makes the point that the state
has become too dependent on gasoline and is vulnerable to
disruptions.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the fact that a single refinery problem can send a
tremor through the entire state should be a jolt that the state
needs better funding of mass transit, particularly systems that
rely on fuels that aren't petroleum based.

 CELL PHONES ARE FOR THE BIRDS  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I didn't set out to be the journalistic Carrie
Nation of cell phones, but it is my duty to report alarming news
when I stumble across it, as I was saying just this morning to the
people washing my car, the former staff of KPFA.
</P>
<P>
   And I have nothing against cell phones. Cell phones don't annoy
and endanger others,  &LR; people  &LR; annoy and endanger others. With cell
phones.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, here's today's alarming news:
</P>
<P>
   Down in Los Banos, Calif., there are many mockingbirds. One of
them regularly perches in the tree across the street from the home
of Joel Whitehurst Jr. Thursday morning, Joel strolled out to his
driveway to fetch his Chronicle and made a terrible discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``That bird is usually a source of beautiful music,'' Joel says,
``but it has learned to imitate very precisely the ring of a cell
phone. Do you think he will stop when his battery runs down?''
</P>
<P>
   What do I look like, an ornithologist? (See mug shot. Good God,
I  &LR; do  &LR; look like an ornithologist.)
</P>
<P>
   This certainly gives a new meaning to ``bird calls.''
</P>
<P>
   All I know, Joel, is if your mockingbird is expecting to hear
from a crow, he'll need caw-waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Also, you might be stuck with the bird. He'll probably stay in
that tree to avoid costly roaming charges.
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon to Fox TV: ``When Birds Impersonate Annoying
Electronic Sounds.'' Today: My parrot thinks he's a smoke alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you do, Joel, don't take that bird to dinner at Moose's
Restaurant in San Francisco's North Beach. Ed Moose's joint has
gone cell free, because Ed found that many diners are annoyed by
Mr. Bigshot at the next table speaking in typical cell-yell,
closing a deal. So there are stern warnings on the menus and on the
tables.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Ed asked cell phonies to take/make their calls in
the bar area, but this was annoying to the drinkers, many of whom
are already edgy because they can't smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like we're headed for side-by-side outdoor compounds,''
Ed says, ``one for smokers and one for cell-phoners. Maybe we could
do a mixer.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe Ed could send the cellies to City Hair and Nails in
Seaside. Bruce Carlen got his hair cut there and reports:
</P>
<P>
   ``The barber was on her cell phone through most of the haircut.
I don't know what she was talking about, because she was speaking
in Vietnamese, but I'm glad it wasn't something infuriating.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she was talking to her bird.
</P>
<P>
   FREE SPEECH is becoming less free and more costly.
</P>
<P>
   The KPFA situation is such an easy call, it barely rates
commentary. Clearly an unclear-on-the-concept. You start a radio
station based on free speech, then you order the speakers not to
speak freely?
</P>
<P>
   This whole thing would have blown over in two days if management
had told staff, ``We fired your beloved general manager because
we're desperately trying to build our audience so we can stay in
business and continue to employ all of you. We insist that you not
only report this firing on-air, but verbally rip us to shreds for
it. We hired you to tell the audience what you think. Do your
job.''
</P>
<P>
   A gag order at a hippie radio station in Berkeley. It would be
hard to think of a worse idea. A cell phone at a funeral, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   MAYBE a worse idea would be to film a TV commercial for beer,
featuring gay guys, make a big deal out of how progressive you are
for daring to target a gay audience for a macho product, then get
cold-filtered feet and shove the commercial back in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Thus offending homophobes by doing the commercial, gays by not
running it and everyone else by being so wimpy and wishy-washy.
</P>
<P>
   First the gays get shoved around by the religious
fundamentalists, then the Mormons, then the Catholics, now the
Miller Brewing Co.
</P>
<P>
   It's starting to look like a vast Christian-Alcohol-wing
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The politics gets confusing. Tom Ammiano, president of the San
Francisco Board of Supes, is bringing heat on the Mormons for
violating the separation of church and state by using their clout
and money to support California legislation against gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Trinity Episcopal Church, which celebrates its
150th year in San Francisco tomorrow, is proud of its public
support for such political issues as same-gender marriage, funding
for HIV research and opposition to capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned for social action as well as social
service,'' says Robert Warren Cromey, the rector.
</P>
<P>
   Which is great. Cromey's crew is an absolute rock of the
community for gays and straights and those who fluctuate. But how
is that kind of committed social and political activism
fundamentally different from what the Mormons are doing? Except
that the Mormons have more money.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have the answer to that question, by the way. I'm an
ornithologist, not a theologian.

   Are you fed up with ``Eyes Wide Shut'' yet? Can you stand any
more of those slightly-out-of-focus stills of Tom and Nicole
snogging in front of a mirror with that effortful,
for-God's-sake-no-tongues-we're-married air of qualified passion?
</P>
<P>
   Can you read any more outpourings from ex-friends of the late
Stanley Kubrick, about what a cold, heartless creep he was, what a
chilly visionary with his mad eyes and exiguous beard, how
heartlessly he used people with the endlessly deferred promise of
cinematic glory (``I have the whore's consolations: whatever I am,
he chose me; he chose me; he chose me. How many reasons is that to
be happy?'' asks Frederic Raphael, the screenwriter).
</P>
<P>
   How much longer can you wait to find out the movie's Big Secret.
Do Cruise and Kidman actually have it off on-screen? (An old
chestnut in the history of movie speculation _ we wondered the same
thing about Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie in ``Don't Look
Now,'' about John Lone and Jane March in ``The Lover,'' about Jack
Nicholson and Jessica Lange in ``The Postman Always Rings Twice.'')
</P>
<P>
   Is the film an inspection of the wildest shores of human
sexuality? Does Tom Cruise really swan around in a Vivienne
Westwood frock? Is it the first intellectual blue movie? What's all
this stuff about the masked-orgy scene?
</P>
<P>
   I suspect we're all a little weary of being tantalized, teased
and trailered, subjected to the protracted foreplay of hints and
half-reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Brothers, which produced the movie, has refused to let
critics see previews except for a favored handful like the guys at
Time magazine, who were then sworn to secrecy about the content,
while publishing a four-page cover story about everything except
What Happens in it.
</P>
<P>
   Oh for God's sake. You want to know the plot? Right then...
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is a comedy thriller with science-fiction
overtones in which Dr. William Hartman (Cruise), a former physician
turned tightrope-walker in a travelling circus, who, while
performing in a Wyoming backwoods town, falls in love with Alice
(Kidman), the local barfly, after watching her regale the company
with Janis Joplin numbers at Krazy Kath's Karaoke Bar.
</P>
<P>
   They emigrate to England, set up home in Wandsworth, and have a
baby which is stolen by aliens from the planet Encripticon II.
</P>
<P>
   Their attempts to retrieve the infant are thwarted by shady
Detective Chief Inspector McTaggart (Billy Connolly) so they enlist
the help of a hilariously inept Bermondsey gumshoe called Sid
(Danny De Vito, cast against type) who, with his on-off girlfriend
Norma (Catherine Zeta Jones), discovers the existence of a sect of
orgiastic Dorothy Squires fans led by Obi-Wan Sinatra (Pete
Postlethwaite) bent on ridding the planet of mobile telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Alice gets her kit off, Hartman spends a lot of time brooding in
front of a black monolith, the baby mutates into a galactic sheep
and the film ends with a shoot-out in the Millennium Dome.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I call a plot. And remember: you read it here
first. &QL;

<P>
   Are you fed up with ``Eyes Wide Shut'' yet? Can you stand any
more of those slightly-out-of-focus stills of Tom and Nicole
snogging in front of a mirror with that effortful,
for-God's-sake-no-tongues-we're-married air of qualified passion?
</P>
<P>
   Can you read any more outpourings from ex-friends of the late
Stanley Kubrick, about what a cold, heartless creep he was, what a
chilly visionary with his mad eyes and exiguous beard, how
heartlessly he used people with the endlessly deferred promise of
cinematic glory (``I have the whore's consolations: whatever I am,
he chose me; he chose me; he chose me. How many reasons is that to
be happy?'' asks Frederic Raphael, the screenwriter).
</P>
<P>
   How much longer can you wait to find out the movie's Big Secret.
Do Cruise and Kidman actually have it off on-screen? (An old
chestnut in the history of movie speculation _ we wondered the same
thing about Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie in ``Don't Look
Now,'' about John Lone and Jane March in ``The Lover,'' about Jack
Nicholson and Jessica Lange in ``The Postman Always Rings Twice.'')
</P>
<P>
   Is the film an inspection of the wildest shores of human
sexuality? Does Tom Cruise really swan around in a Vivienne
Westwood frock? Is it the first intellectual blue movie? What's all
this stuff about the masked-orgy scene?
</P>
<P>
   I suspect we're all a little weary of being tantalized, teased
and trailered, subjected to the protracted foreplay of hints and
half-reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Brothers, which produced the movie, has refused to let
critics see previews except for a favored handful like the guys at
Time magazine, who were then sworn to secrecy about the content,
while publishing a four-page cover story about everything except
What Happens in it.
</P>
<P>
   Oh for God's sake. You want to know the plot? Right then...
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is a comedy thriller with science-fiction
overtones in which Dr. William Hartman (Cruise), a former physician
turned tightrope-walker in a travelling circus, who, while
performing in a Wyoming backwoods town, falls in love with Alice
(Kidman), the local barfly, after watching her regale the company
with Janis Joplin numbers at Krazy Kath's Karaoke Bar.
</P>
<P>
   They emigrate to England, set up home in Wandsworth, and have a
baby which is stolen by aliens from the planet Encripticon II.
</P>
<P>
   Their attempts to retrieve the infant are thwarted by shady
Detective Chief Inspector McTaggart (Billy Connolly) so they enlist
the help of a hilariously inept Bermondsey gumshoe called Sid
(Danny De Vito, cast against type) who, with his on-off girlfriend
Norma (Catherine Zeta Jones), discovers the existence of a sect of
orgiastic Dorothy Squires fans led by Obi-Wan Sinatra (Pete
Postlethwaite) bent on ridding the planet of mobile telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Alice gets her kit off, Hartman spends a lot of time brooding in
front of a black monolith, the baby mutates into a galactic sheep
and the film ends with a shoot-out in the Millennium Dome.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I call a plot. And remember: you read it here
first. &QL;

<P>
   Bonnie Lipton's first words as a candidate for the presidency of
Hadassah came from Deuteronomy, and her heart: ``I have set before
you life and death,'' she said to her national board, quoting Moses
speaking to the Jews. ``Therefore choose life, that both thou and
thy seed may live.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lipton understood the words better than she had ever
expected, or wanted. On Jan. 11, 1998, her husband, Alan, 59, had a
catastrophic skiing accident at Jiminy Peak, in Massachusetts _
five months after she was told that she had breast cancer and one
week after she began radiation.
</P>
<P>
   In the car on the way to the hospital to see her husband, she
turned to the friend with her and said, ``Do you realize that we
don't know if Alan is alive or dead, and I have to go for radiation
tomorrow either way?''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Lipton lived, but he is in a nursing home with severe brain
damage, unable to care for himself or remember what happened five
minutes before. Bonnie Lipton, who in 39 years of marriage
succeeded her husband as the leader of three other Jewish
organizations, has decided to carry on. She has chosen, as if it
were a choice at all, life.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what we both went through, I decided I was going to
channel all my energy into working for Hadassah and for Israel,''
Mrs. Lipton said. ``Because that was the core of what we both
believed in. And if something happened to me tomorrow _ you can't
help it, you realize this _ I would like it to be said that I made
a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 27 in Washington, Mrs. Lipton, who is 59, is to take
over as Hadassah's new president. The same day, the organization is
to give Hillary Rodham Clinton an award, which was the cause of a
small but well-documented (by local television cameras) protest
outside Hadassah's West 58th Street headquarters on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   About two dozen women and men _ Mrs. Lipton said she was
relieved the numbers were small _ burned a huge Hadassah card to
protest Mrs. Clinton's support for a Palestinian state. The First
Lady and likely New York Senate candidate has repeatedly said she
was only expressing the views of Israel's former Prime Minister,
Yitzak Rabin. Many polls show that most Israelis accept Palestinian
statehood as inevitable and even desirable, but opposition is
widespread among conservative American Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a nonpartisan organization,'' Mrs. Lipton said early
Thursday at Hadassah's headquarters. ``We are not honoring her as a
political candidate. We are honoring her as the first lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Brushing aside the protest was only one item on Mrs. Lipton's
schedule Thursday. By midmorning she was on the shuttle to
Washington to attend a lunch for Nava Barak, the wife of Prime
Minister Ehud Barak of Israel. Mrs. Lipton was planning to be back
in Washington on Sunday for a White House state dinner for Mr.
Barak. Meanwhile she was working on the speech she has to make on
July 27. And of course, worrying about the future of Hadassah,
which with 306,000 members is the largest women's and Jewish
organization in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the Zionist and social service group has shrunk from its
high of more than 350,000 members in the 1980s, and has tried in
recent years to attract younger women and reinvent itself. (The
comedian Sarah Bernhard is a member, but more than half of
Hadassah's women are over 61, and 20 percent of the membership are
over 75.) ``The women for whom Hadassah was their life, and who
brought us where Hadassah is today, they're dying,'' Mrs. Lipton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lipton herself joined only when her mother-in-law gave her
a lifetime membership. It was 1961, she was 21, and she felt no
real need for the organization until 1971, when she moved to
Pittsfield, Mass., her husband's hometown and the base of his
family's steel and then used-machinery business. In 1975 she
visited Israel for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt this is going to be my career, this is who I am,''
Mrs. Lipton said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years she volunteered her way upward at Hadassah,
raised two children and accompanied her husband on his quests.
``We'd see a rusty piece of something in the backyard of some
company and he would light up,'' Mrs. Lipton said.
</P>
<P>
   Her world fell apart in the summer of 1997, when she learned she
had breast cancer, underwent a lumpectomy and began chemotherapy.
Then it fell apart again with her husband's accident, a week after
Sonny Bono and Michael L. Kennedy, a son of Robert F. Kennedy, died
on the slopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't take risks,'' Mrs. Lipton said of her husband. ``He
wasn't out to jump the highest mogul. And he was wearing a
helmet.'' She still doesn't know what happened, whether he slipped
making a turn, or hit a tree, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lipton now divides her time between Pittsfield, where her
husband lives, and a midtown Manhattan apartment that she shares
with two women. She visits her husband regularly, and sometimes
talks with him on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can speak,'' she said. ``He's sometimes quite appropriate.
Yes, he knows who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lipton then smiled. ``And he knows I'm going to be the
president.''

 &HT;    Early learning: Cradle to classroom touted
 &HT;    By Chris Reinolds
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Worried that her son wouldn't be academically
competitive, Lisa Ramsay moved her 3-year-old from a traditional
day care center to a preschool where academics win out over
unstructured playtime.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsay, a Sugar Hill resident, enrolled her son in a Primrose
school, which promotes the still-controversial educational
philosophy that structured learning begins at birth. Infants listen
to classical music, are taught simple concepts and learn to follow
directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to Primrose in 1995,'' said Ramsay, a financial
portfolio manager. ``They had the discipline to get the kids ready
for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Both of Ramsay's sons, Stephen, now 7, and Matthew, 2, attend
Primrose's recently accredited school outside Atlanta. Ramsay said
accreditation provided a stamp of approval that reassured her that
her children are getting the best.
</P>
<P>
   Primrose accepts children from 6 weeks old to 5 years with
after-school programs for older children. The academics-from-birth
approach led Primrose schools to seek and gain accreditation by the
Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.
</P>
<P>
   Primrose CEO Jo Kirchner said it took several years to convince
the SACS and other regional accreditation groups that preschools
should be academically accredited. The SACS, best known for its
accreditation of elementary and high schools and colleges,
previously reviewed educational programs only down to 4-year-old
pre-kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (SACS) were not interested in the preschool area,''
Kirchner said. ``We stayed in touch and encouraged them to look at
early childhood. There's so much emphasis put on the first five
years of a child's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steve Baker, SACS executive director of the commission on
elementary and middle schools, said Primrose is the first
for-profit franchise group the organization has evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started this because there was interest in the public for
these types of institutions,'' Baker said. Other SACS-accredited
companies include Sylvan Learning Centers, which offer
supplementary education for schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The SACS based its approval of Primrose on its evaluation of the
company's business plan, financial status, method of educating
students and quality control.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have development programs. It's not just a matter of
baby-sitting,'' Baker said. After he reviewed two of the accredited
schools, Baker said: ``Both were places I would put my
grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Most early childhood organizations are accredited by the
National Association for the Education of Young Children. Kirchner
said Primrose officials agree with many NAEYC philosophies, but
they did not seek the group's accreditation because it emphasizes
child-initiated learning. ``We believe in a blend of
teacher-initiated and child-initiated,'' Kirchner said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Glowacki, NAEYC director of accreditation programs,
said with parents, there seems to be two camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear parents say, `I don't want baby-sitting. I want them to
be learning something,''' she said. ``But I also talk to parents
who say, `I don't want my child to be stressed out. I don't want
academic stuff crammed down their throat.' In reality what parents
want is a combination of care and education.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Henry, research director for the Council on School
Performance at Georgia State University, said he did not know SACS
accredited preschools but that studies have shown that programs
like those at Primrose are among the least effective.
</P>
<P>
   Henry acknowledged that Primrose's approach is popular with
parents concerned that their preschool children aren't being
academically prepared, but said it's better to let children
progress at their own pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should follow their natural curiosity, so that you're
building on the natural assets of children,'' Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   He said parents looking for a child care center should ask how
the day is organized and what activities are planned. Also, find
out how much of the day is set aside to allow the child to choose
what he or she wants to do, Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said the trend in child care programs is toward learning
rather than baby-sitting. He said SACS accreditation allows
children to be prepared for the standards of the schools they will
be entering. ``The accreditation allows a seamless system, if you
will, of trying to assure the public that the quality and a lot of
the safeguards are in place in schools,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Six of 65 Primrose schools nationwide are now SACS-accredited.

 &HT;    The frustrating differences between government and business
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ I wouldn't know a trihalomethene if I drank
one which, of course, is exactly the problem. I am drinking them
and so is almost everyone else who gets water from a surface water
source, that is, a river or a lake.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Marshall, we get the opportunity to drink them at levels
higher than the Environmental Protection Agency says we ought to
be. Mind you it is only ever so slightly higher than the standard,
but higher it is, make no doubt about it.
</P>
<P>
   The standard itself seems unbelievably small. The law allows
trihalomethene _ let's call it THM before I misspell it _ at levels
no more than six parts per billion.
</P>
<P>
   To show you how small that is, there are roughly 5 billion
people on earth. If we named 35 of them THM for a day, there would
about be as many people named THM in the entire world population as
there is the actual chemical in the Marshall water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I think we would all agree that there are some things we
don't want any parts per billion of in the water. Furthermore, the
fact that the standard is so stringent for THM is a clue that it is
nasty stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But, actually, this is not a column about THM or environmental
standards at all. It is about the most important way that
government differs from business and why I think people get so
infuriated with government. Here's an clue: It has nothing to do
with how much money government spends or how much tax it levies.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what is happening with the latest THM scare _ something
very similar happened about two years ago. The TNRCC sends a letter
to Marshall water customers saying the THM level in Marshall water
is too high. The newspaper calls the city and is told _ essentially
_ that the letter is balderdash. The water is safe for everyone to
drink and there is nothing to worry about. The newspaper then calls
the TNRCC _ the people who sent the letter, remember? _ and is
essentially told the same thing: The water is safe.
</P>
<P>
   So why send out the letter? Is anybody running this show, or is
it on automatic pilot? You all know the answer: It is on automatic
pilot.
</P>
<P>
   If THMs are bad _ and I suspect that they are _ then the
standard ought to be the rule and the person (whom we all pay) to
see that the standard is met should be jumping through every
possible hoop to see it is done.
</P>
<P>
   This is where government is different than business. Permit me
to illustrate.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has ever bought a cheap wrench knows that standards
count. In wrenches, for instance, it is important to know that the
size marked is that size that you have. How much tolerance do you
suppose, say, Craftsman has for its wrenches? I don't know, but I'm
sure it is tiny.
</P>
<P>
   This is just a guess, but I'd say when a Craftsman wrench
doesn't meet the standard, it isn't even offered to the customer.
Furthermore, if a bunch of wrenches at a plant don't meet the
standard, somebody takes radical action.
</P>
<P>
   No representative from Craftsman will ever tell a newspaper not
to worry about a standard. They will promise that customers get
great wrenches and somebody behind the scenes will do whatever is
necessary to see that they meet that promise.
</P>
<P>
   To make an exact comparison, if the Coca-Cola company were found
to have an excessive amount of THMs in one of their products, the
company would go into overdrive to see that the problem was fixed.
A company spokesman might try to put a positive spin on the
problem, but no one would rest at Coca-Cola until the mission had
been accomplished. I suspect that Coca-Cola has standards that far
exceed what any outside source might require. That is good
business.
</P>
<P>
   And Coca-Cola would never assume that people would simply keep
using a product that did not meet the standard. To do so would be
fatal to their business.
</P>
<P>
   But government _ all kinds of governments and at all levels
everywhere _ just shrug their collective shoulders and give us a
goofy grin. Why, shucks, they're doing the best that they can.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, we know better than that. Most of us work at
businesses where we have to do more with less every day. Excuses
are why people get so frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Please don't whine about unfunded government mandates. Paying
customers set the highest unfunded mandates of all and businesses
learn to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   Don't pat our heads and tell us not to worry ourselves about
those mean old THMs, tell us what you are doing to fix the problem.
Tell us that you intend to meet the standard now and in the future.

 &HT;    Child and grandparent a prefect match for a fishing expedition
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ This was a Sunday out of the past. Perhaps
swayed by the latest scientific revelation that a daily glass of
iced tea makes you practically immune to heart attacks, my wife
decided to temporarily ignore her high position with the fat
police. She actually fried chicken in grease and fixed thick gravy
to pour over the rice.
</P>
<P>
   I was ready to stretch out under the oak tree in the back yard
when our granddaughter announced she and some of her friends
planned to go fishing. We were appalled when her irresponsible
parents told her to go ahead, casually reminding her to be home in
time for youth fellowship at the church.
</P>
<P>
   Our granddaughter is only 14 years old, for goodness' sakes! She
doesn't know about snakes and wasps and quicksand; or how fish
hooks can put out an eye, or get caught in skin and require
emergency surgery; or how lightning strikes around water; or how
easy it is to fall in and drown.
</P>
<P>
   It's frightening the way today's parents just turn kids loose in
the world without a smidgen of supervision. It's so bad in our case
we've considered alerting the authorities responsible for
investigating child neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring accusations about being overly protective and a
worrywart, and causing embarrassment to a young lady practically
ready for college, I changed into my fishing clothes and appointed
myself chaperon.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing expeditions that include teen-age girls aren't as simple
as they sound. We had to get creaky rods and reels operating, check
out the tackle box, stop by the store for red wigglers and soft
drinks, and wait around while Sunday dresses were swapped for more
appropriate attire. I was surprised when Stephanie and Mary Ann and
Kelli, who only hours earlier had looked so prim and proper in the
choir loft, dug into the box of red wigglers and began sticking
them on hooks like veteran anglers.
</P>
<P>
   Our expedition grew to include John, Cole and Danny, three
cousins, and David, a newcomer to the community who, although only
a fifth-grader, obviously did some serious fishing where he lived
before.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't say our stringer was heavy when we headed home, or
that David wasn't a little disappointed with his luck, but we
weren't skunked.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered if going fishing is as big a thing with kids now as
it was with my generation. I thought about the first fish I ever
caught. It came out of the Flint River, a few hundred yards from
where Stephanie and her friends fished her uncle's pond on this
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   My grandfather had taken me, for the first time, to his favorite
spot on the river. Our red wigglers, transported in a tomato can,
were dug from behind the barn. My pole was a cane cut from a creek
bottom. I hoped someday to own tackle like my grandfather's
shellacked sections of cane with metal fittings on the ends. His
rig could be taken apart and quickly reassembled, the only
store-bought fishing pole I'd ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   My cork was a stopper taken from an empty syrup can, not a
plastic ball from Wal-Mart. After all these decades, I can still
see it bob under water, and remember the gush of adrenaline when I
realized what was happening. I can still see that fish coming out
of the water and onto the bank as I frantically held onto my pole
while walking backward. Trembling with excitement, as I recall. Not
the best technique, as my grandfather explained, but it worked.
</P>
<P>
   My virgin catch was the size of a grown man's hand, a bream with
a bright red belly. My grandfather said we'd have a fine supper
when my grandmother fried it and fixed hush puppies. He was right.
One can visit the great restaurants of the world, but one will find
no fish to match a red-bellied bream caught on your own hook,
scaled and cleaned by your grandfather, and fried by your
grandmother on the wood stove in her kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   I was silently lamenting the fact that with times and things so
different, a fishing trip with Grandpa likely won't make much of an
impression on today's kids.
</P>
<P>
   Then Stephanie asked the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you remember the first time you took me fishing?'' she
asked. Of course I did. She was 3 years old. It was a warm Sunday
afternoon in March, and we were mostly out to enjoy the sun. She
was sitting in my lap. I had a ceremonial hook in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the line went taut and the pole bent. Together we
started to reel. Nearing the bank, a big bass jumped and, with huge
mouth gaping, shook furiously, trying to throw the hook. Stephanie
screamed, jumped out of my lap, ran for her tricycle parked on the
driveway, and began frantically pedaling for home.
</P>
<P>
   I was surprised she remembered, and that despite her inglorious
departure from the scene, she considers that old bass her first
catch, and the episode one of her strong memories of childhood.
</P>
<P>
   If I wrote a column of helpful hints for grandfathers, my
premier advice would be to never pass up a fishing trip with a
grandchild.

   FILM-REVIEW-EYES-1 (Undated) _ R rating or no R rating, Stanley
Kubrick's final film offers a disturbing ferry ride into an
ink-black sexual underworld. ``No dream is ever just a dream,''
says Dr. William (Tom Cruise), half-hopeful, half-shattered, in the
movie's sudden close. There's no better epitaph to Kubrick's
career. By AMY BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-EYES-2 (Undated) _ ``If you men only knew,'' says a
stoned Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman) after her physician husband,
Bill (Tom Cruise), tells her that he doesn't think women act on
sexual impulse, that they can't give into adulterous depravity.
It's a theme of ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' Stanley Kubrick's final film
and his last foray into the arctic circle of the American male
subconscious. By WESLEY MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-WOOD (Undated) _ The 1985 slo-jam, ``If This World
Were Mine,'' is laid out in all its back-in-the-day glory in ``The
Wood.'' The song made a minor national dent at the time, but it's a
Vandross staple and the unofficial love theme of writer-director
Rick Famuyiwa's ``Thriller''-era period piece that manages to apply
a black sensibility to the high-school high life that's been the
domain of white-male memories all year. By WESLEY MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-BLAIR (Undated) _ If you're looking for the telltale
sign that ``The Blair Witch Project'' is no-joke terrifying, you
need look no further than the shrieking kid trying with all his
2-year-old might to cover his mother's mouth as she tells an
amateur film crew about the myth of the Blair Witch. By WESLEY
MORRIS.

days, or just annoyingly promoting that impression? A) Stop

   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ After suffering numerous gunshot

he's living the high life in San Francisco for a week with his new
friend Rashad Williams, who collected pledges for running The
Examiner Bay-to- Breakers, so far raising $40,000 to help pay
Lance's medical bills. By ROB MORSE.

 &HT;    Our days as knuckle-draggers linger longer than we thought
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ At the rate that science is unraveling life's
mysteries, it shouldn't be long before humans achieve total
enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   It has appeared that way over the past few weeks as scientific
revelations shattered the faith-based beliefs of many people.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand why inflexible religions condemn
scientific conclusions that demystify holy doctrines. The same goes
for individuals. No one wants to hear that deeply felt beliefs are
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study that has upset a lot of people reported that
Neanderthals aren't just for textbooks anymore. Neanderthals now
are for mating, going fishing with and electing to high public
office.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Neanderthals are us to varying degrees, which
might explain why some people act the way they do.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Erik Trinkaus, a paleoanthropologist at Washington
University in St. Louis, recently reported the discovery of the
24,600-year-old skeleton of a boy in Portugal that has the facial
features of modern humans but the unmistakable body of a brutish
Neanderthal.
</P>
<P>
   Since Neanderthals were supposedly extinct for 4,000 years by
the time the boy was born, scientists have concluded that the boy
was the product of interbreeding.
</P>
<P>
   This finding fits in with earlier DNA research that came to the
same conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, DNA tests to detect Neanderthal heritage might be
required before people apply for certain jobs.
</P>
<P>
   NFL teams would pay extra for players who come from a long line
of knuckle-draggers. On the other hand, a strong Neanderthal
lineage might be a drawback for a customer service manager.
</P>
<P>
   Congress can be viewed as Neanderthals on one side of the aisle
and Cro-Magnons on the other side. The side you pick may say a lot
about your ancestry. This subject requires additional scientific
study.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent scientific study found that humans are not the
only animals that develop cultural customs. The results of 151
years of chimpanzee research concluded that these ape relatives
invent and learn cultural behavior patterns among groups that are
separated, a characteristic once thought to be an insurmountable
dividing line between humans and all other animals.
</P>
<P>
   This shouldn't be terribly surprising since science already
showed humans and chimpanzees, who share 98 percent of the same
DNA, trace back to a common ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another recent scientific study reported that the internal
clocks of humans and other animals work just the same, which was a
blow to human-centric people who have long maintained that humans
are unique in their ability to adjust their sleep-wake cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Nope, wrong again. As Charles Darwin said years ago, the
difference between humans and animals, particularly higher animals,
is one of degree, not of kind.
</P>
<P>
   Then we have a new scientific study that found women
subconsciously change their mating strategies during their
menstrual cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Many studies have shown that women routinely choose men with
more feminine features for their long-term partners. The new
cross-cultural and cross-ethnic study found that women select more
rugged-looking men for short-term sexual relationships at the most
fertile point of their cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Although these studies are not tied together, I'm guessing that
the study that found how a woman's menstrual cycle guides her
choice in men is why we've got Neanderthals in our family tree.
</P>
<P>
   On the subconscious level, apparently it's all right to date a
Neanderthal, just don't marry one. Kinder, gentler pretty men can
raise the kids. That's probably fine with Neanderthals who are just
happy to be alive.

 &HT;    Taking on the treehouse
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I suppose that with an animated Tarzan stirring the
imaginations of young and old alike, things like this are occurring
to a lot of folks these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am about to attempt to build a treehouse, mainly for the
kids,'' writes an electronic correspondent. ``I am an amateur, so I
need all the advice I can get. Do you have any helpful info?''
</P>
<P>
   Being a devotee of the Johnny Weismuller school of Tarzaning, no
wasp-waisted cartoon character can get my blood aboil. And I'm
certainly not a professional treehouse contractor. However, I have
built a couple in my career _ I think Weismuller was still The Man
then, too _ and I tried to dredge up what I could from the mists of
failing memory.
</P>
<P>
   The result wasn't really enough to be helpful. So I did the next
best thing _ which, presumably, my correspondent could have done _
and went to the World Wide Web and its many search engines. There
are thousands of hits for treehouses, most of them having nothing
to do with building one, but some engines allow a more defined
search.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of hits to get you going.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  www.uniquetreehouse.com is a commercial outfit that will build
it for you. Failing that, they will consult you on building it
yourself. Of course, they want money for this.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  www.btinternet.com/''fulton/treehouse.htm appears to be
British in origin, and is a fairly broad discussion of how to build
your own treehouse.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  pages.prodigy.net/magiix/treehouse/index.html is the snazziest
personal Web page I've seen. This fellow has cooked up animated
plans and diagrams for the treehouse he made for his son.
</P>
<P>
   Let this be a lesson, folks. If you are hooked into the
Internet, you have available information on virtually any subject
under the sun _ and any subject that avoids the light, too, for
that matter. You have to exercise judgment _ all the information on
the Web is not necessarily good information. You have to exercise
patience _ chances are that your searches will turn up tons of
stuff that's irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, you can go to a place like www.amazon.com and
find out what books are available on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all books are going to be worth your time,
either. Back in the dark days, virtually all the available books on
woodworking were either useless and full of bad information, or
dull, depressing vocational school texts. There are, probably,
hundreds of very useful books on woodworking available now, but
still the awful ones keep getting published.
</P>
<P>
   One came to my desk the other day. It's ``Great 2X4 Accessories
for Your Home,'' published by Lark Books. The title is somewhat
misleading _ the projects use all kinds of dimensioned pine lumber.
``Great,'' of course, is in the eye of the beholder. I find most of
the projects greatly disgusting.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, however, are their construction methods. For instance, in
building a coffee table, we are told to buy a ready-laminated pine
table top and trim it to size. Then we cut four pieces to make a
frame around this top and glue everything together, cross-grain
construction, end-grain gluing, all that.
</P>
<P>
   Then as a finale, we ``center the tabletop over the base. Apply
glue to the meeting surfaces, and nail through the Sides (G and H)
into the Base Sides (D and E) using 1 1/2-inch nails spaced every 5
inches.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, it might continue, we can sit back and watch the
Center Top (F) come apart when it tries to expand in wet weather.
In the meantime, we can contemplate all those handsome nailheads.
This is the sort of thing that drives people out of woodworking.

 &HT;    `MoveOn' voters put money where grouch is
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Each morning, political neophyte Jean
Elliott Brown turns on her computer to see how much her
congressional campaign has raised overnight.
</P>
<P>
   She's got mail. She's got money.
</P>
<P>
   There's $25 from Katherine in Seattle. ``I'm still angry and I'm
putting my money where my hostility lies,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Tom in Albuquerque, N.M., sends $20. ``I dislike the
Republicans' position on guns,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Dick in San Antonio gives $50. ``I generally don't trust
politicians,'' he writes, ``but good luck.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past six weeks, 1,700 people from 50 states have donated
an average of $37 to raise $52,000 for Brown's bid to unseat
incumbent Republican Mark Foley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only three of the contributors are people I know,'' she said.
``I hope to raise $1 million by next year's election.''
</P>
<P>
   How does somebody in Nebraska come to write a check for an
unknown, untried candidate from Palm Beach Gardens?
</P>
<P>
   The Internet makes it possible, of course. And the common
contempt for lawmakers who voted for the impeachment of President
Clinton makes it necessary, donors say.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 48, is harvesting the proceeds of dissent created by what
touts itself as the nation's first grass-roots cyberspace political
movement. Born last fall during the height of the impeachment wars,
MoveOn.org is the creation of two Silicon Valley computer software
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Blades and Wes Boyd spent $89.50 to build a Web site where
Clinton defenders could muster on line. About 500,000 did, and many
pledged contributions ranging from $25 to $2,500 to a ``We Will
Remember'' campaign to defeat impeachment supporters in the 2000
election.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Blades and Boyd sent a mass e-mailing to those who
pledged, telling them it was time to put up their money. Thousands
have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We raised more than $250,000 the first five days,'' Blades
said, ``and 92 percent of the contributions were under $50.''
</P>
<P>
   MoveOn has targeted five races, and Internet visitors to the Web
site can click their mouse to select the candidate they wish to
back and the amount they wish to send. Donations by credit card or
checks are accepted, and MoveOn distributes the money weekly to its
five candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Foley (R-West Palm Beach), others targeted for
cyber-ambush are Rep. James Rogan (R-Calif)., Rep. Rick Hill
(R-Mont.), and Sen. John Ashcroft (R-Mo.). MoveOn also is
supporting Rep. Rush Holt (D-N.J.), against an undetermined
Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Foley's office said the congressman was among
only a handful of Republicans who voted to exonerate Clinton on two
of the four articles of impeachment. Kirk Fordham, Foley's chief of
staff, questioned MoveOn's motivations and Brown's, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Floridians will find it somewhat puzzling that (Brown)
would launch her campaign bragging about how much money she
collected out of state from donors who can't even vote in
Florida,'' Fordham said. ``Most people in our district have moved
on from impeachment and are interested in other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   What is unquestioned is that money played a significant role the
last time Foley was challenged for his 16th District seat. In 1996,
Democrat Jim Stuber wound up $26,000 in debt after raising $77,000;
Foley took in $710,000 and cruised to victory with 60 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   A Foley spokesman said the congressman will enter next year's
race with ``at least $1 million'' in his coffers _ ``most all of it
donated by Floridians.''
</P>
<P>
   Blades and Boyd plan to put the names of more candidates on
their Web site for the MoveOn faithful to support. They say the
vulnerability of the incumbent and the strength of the opponent
will dictate which races they enter. Brown's relationship with
MoveOn goes back to October when she signed up with the group and

 &HT;    SULTRY SUMMER NIGHTS, A GOOD FLICK _ AND VODKA?
 &HT;    934. Moving on (i) International wires.
 &HT;    w/photos.
 &HT;    By Charles W. Holmes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW It is not a Chevy sedan, but a boxy, Soviet-designed
Lada, that has pulled into the choice spot in front of the
40-foot-wide outdoor movie screen.
</P>
<P>
   The two couples inside, who've come to Russia's first drive-in
movie to watch the Hollywood disaster flick, ``Deep Impact,'' are
not munching popcorn and sipping sodas, but meat pies and shots of
vodka.
</P>
<P>
   Completing the cultural contrast, they intend to remain upright
in their seats and actually view the film. Really, they insist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard about what Americans do at the drive-in. We were
just curious about this place and came just to watch the movie.
Nothing else,'' said Mikhail Anisymkin, 28, giving a furtive glance
and a smile to his girlfriend, Oxana Dubavitskaya.
</P>
<P>
   More than six decades after its rise and eventual decline in the
United States, the drive-in movie has made it to Russia, opening
three weeks ago on the outskirts of a fashionable Moscow
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Kinodrome,'' (''kino'' means film in Russian) is a
peculiar blend of quintessential Americana and ``Russky
eksperimyent.''
</P>
<P>
   Curious Russians at $16 a carload for movie and snacks pricey in
the depressed Russian economy have been cruising into the Kinodrome
to sample Moscow's newest attraction. And there are more cars
outside the fence than inside, filled with interested onlookers
who've parked alongside the road to get a free peak at the movies.
</P>
<P>
   But if the drive-in catches on in Russia, it will be against
great odds.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Moscow has a latitude problem. The city's location
on the globe means the summer sun does not set until 11 p.m. The
first showing begins soon after, and the second feature begins at 2
a.m. and ends about 4, just as the sun begins to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Geography also leads to the second difficulty for the owners
winter. It arrives early and hard, lasts for months and will make
it difficult to attract customers who are willing to bundle up
inside an icy car.
</P>
<P>
   But Alexander Volkov, one of the founding partners, remains
undeterred. To hear Volkov tell it, the drive-in isn't merely a
place, but a state of mind and a way of life or should be _in
post-Communist Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give the feeling of freedom and open space. Like Americans,
more and more Russians feel more comfortable in their cars. People
like it because it is new. It's a very hot summer, and there's a
nice breeze and a good movie here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The amorous aspect of the American drive-in is not lost on
Volkov, either. The second showing, which begins at 2 a.m. and
attracts a slightly older crowd, is usually a romantic film, if not
erotic. Given the late show times, the drive-in seeks to attract
young adults, not the teen-aged American-Graffiti set associated
with America's drive-in culture.
</P>
<P>
   Most customers are 19 to 27 years of age (driving age in Russia
is 18), and more women than men come to the theater, which is in
the parking lot of a derelict bicycling track built for the 1980
Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Volkov and his partners have added other touches of America.
In-line skating waiters help direct the cars to their spots before
the screening and then take orders for beers, vodka and cabbage
pie.
</P>
<P>
   At the outdoor cafe behind the projection booth, the popcorn
machine was an afterthought. The small meat and vegetable pies,
called pirozhki in Russian, are more popular than popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   In America, a New Jersey businessman is credited with inventing
the drive-in in the 1930s, when he mounted a projector to the roof
of his car and discovered that neighbors would pay to see a movie
beamed onto his garage door.
</P>
<P>
   As Hollywood entered its heyday and the automobile industry
boomed, about 5,000 drive-ins sprouted throughout the United States
in the '40s and '50s. But they have fallen on hard times since,
their numbers now down to fewer than 500 as America turned its
attention to TV and the more comfortable, shopping-mall cinema
multiplexes.
</P>
<P>
   Motion pictures as art and entertainment have always been
immensely popular in Russia. The demise of communist rule brought
more American and Western movies to Moscow. And though strained by
the poor economy, Russia still has its own active film industry.
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, restrictions on
personal freedoms evaporated and car ownership has increased
10-fold in Moscow to about 2.5 million cars. That sounds like an
encouraging statistic for the Kinodrome entrepreneurs, except that
seven out of every 10 Muscovites are still without cars.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the limitations of the drive-in, Volkov and his
partners plan to open a discotheque, a restaurant and outdoor
skating rink on the property to diversify their offerings and
create a sort of outdoor playground for the twenty- and
thirtysomething crowd.
</P>
<P>
   That will be fine with Serafin Semyachkin, 23, who came with two
other friends not so much to see astronauts battle an Earth-bound
comet in ``Deep Impact,'' as to savor a warm midsummer night.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it's where we can drink beer and vodka and enjoy
ourselves, sort of a summer substitute for a bar,'' said
Semyachkin. ``That's not more important than the movie. But one
doesn't hurt the other, does it?''
</P>
<P>
   He and his friends had only one gripe about their first drive-in
experience. As they drained their beer bottles, one asked: ``In
America, are the screens mounted that high? It kind of hurts your
neck to have to look up like that.''

KUBRICK'S FINALE MARRED BY AMERICAN SENSIBILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Stanley Kubrick died on March 8, he left behind 13 films of
high art and obsessive craft. ``2001: A Space Odyssey,''
``Lolita,'' ``Dr. Strangelove,'' ``A Clockwork Orange'' the list
goes on and on, just as the director went on and on, crossing
genres and subverting expectations with each new work.
</P>
<P>
   Elegant, menacing and often cold as a scalpel, Kubrick's best
films dissect emotions without engaging them: There's something
both clinical and dreamlike about them, like an autopsy filmed
through the gauze of LSD.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' Kubrick's extraordinary,
flawed last movie and a fitting coda to a career built on astral
visions. Based on ``Traumnovelle'' (``Dream Novel''), by Austrian
writer Arthur Schnitzler, the film stars real-life spouses Tom
Cruise and Nicole Kidman as a young Manhattan couple who become
obsessed with infidelity. More accurately, they become obsessed
with the idea of infidelity and with the substance of temptation,
which hounds them throughout the movie in fantasy and in flesh. It
is the great, unseen protagonist in a film with two huge stars.
</P>
<P>
   Set mostly at night in the week before Christmas, Kubrick's film
leads its characters on a bizarre nocturnal ramble not unlike Kyle
MacLachlan's netherworld descent in ``Blue Velvet.'' The film opens
as Dr. William (Tom Cruise) and Alice (Kidman) Harford are rushing
out the door to a ritzy holiday party at the home of one of Bill's
patients, Victor (Sidney Pollack). Shortly after arriving, they
peel off to flirt with other people: Alice with a slick Hungarian
ladies' man, Bill sandwiched between models. But Alice resists the
urge to cheat, and Bill is pulled away to tend to a prostitute who
has inconveniently OD'd in Victor's bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The next evening, egged on by a fat joint, Alice confronts Bill
about the models _ did he boff them? No, he says. Did he want to
boff them? No, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation then morphs into an addled discourse on
temptation and fidelity, wherein Bill declaims that men are
obsessed with sex while women, occupied with the finer matters of
hearth and home, are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If ... you ... men ... only ... knew,'' whispers his wife, who
confesses to an idee fixe of her own. It seems Alice almost did it
with a naval officer in Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   This single confession not of an action, but a fantasy seizes
Bill's imagination and propels him into the night. His ramble takes
him from temptress to temptress (among them a slack Lolita, played
by Leelee Sobieski) on a path illuminated at every turn by surreal
curtains of Christmas lights; everything throbs with the depraved
glow of a carnival. The climax of his wandering (and the film) is a
minutely choreographed, pseudo-Satanic orgy sequence in which
Saturnalian partiers copulate vigorously and gymnastically under
the gaze of austere hooded figures.
</P>
<P>
   This is the scene that's caused all the buzzing, and justly so.
It's graphic. Less so, somewhat, for the cloaking digital effects
that transformed the film from an NC-17 into an R, but still: This
isn't Shirley Temple on the Good Ship Lollipop. Yet Kubrick clearly
meant the scene not as titillation but as metaphorical counterpart
to Alice's own carnal rove, which she experiences in dreams and
describes to her husband in full detail. Alice's dreams are never
portrayed on screen, but you wish they were; they might have given
``Eyes Wide Shut'' an added sense of balance. They might also have
given Nicole Kidman more to do than act drunk, or drugged, or
half-asleep on the lip of a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise is convincing in a complex and elusive role, though it's
hard to shake the suspicion that he's done better work in
less-ambitious movies. For all the shuddering epiphanies in ``Eyes
Wide Shut,'' ``Jerry Maguire'' was, in many ways, a more genuinely
moving picture. And while it's fascinating to watch Cruise and
Kidman in a mock-up of their own marriage, in the end it's not
quite enough; their hungry foreplay (familiar to anyone who saw the
trailer) is beautiful and remote, lacking in the messy realities of
love.
</P>
<P>
   There's an aimlessness to Kubrick's film, a sense that he wasn't
entirely sure where his characters were headed or where his
audience might follow. The orgiastic centerpiece is never explained
to anyone's satisfaction, Bill's or ours, and the film's final
scene seems startlingly abrupt. Yet where ``Eyes Wide Shut''
succeeds, it succeeds profoundly: as a meditation on sex and
jealousy, as a dreamscape of desire, as a surprisingly moral look
at the fight to stay faithful to one's spouse. For all its graphic
bump-and-grind, the film is more about the lure to sin than the sin
itself.
</P>
<P>
   And it is a ramble, after all. It isn't in a rush it's 155
minutes long and maturely paced, all pauses and glances and fulgent
moments of insight. Like Kubrick's other films, ``Eyes Wide Shut''
uses music as effectively as light, emphasizing the film's oom-pah
dreaminess (and Viennese source material) with a teetering waltz
from Dmitri Shostakovich's ``Jazz Suite.'' He also includes a stark
piano excerpt from Gyorgy Ligeti, who popped up on the soundtracks
for ``2001'' and ``The Shining.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a word about ratings. And orgies.
</P>
<P>
   Before Kubrick died, he decided to skirt the thorny matter of
on-screen intercourse by agreeing to blur portions of the party
scene and release the film stateside with an R. The original would
be released untouched overseas. A press screening earlier this week
featured the unexpurgated European version, followed by a brief
clip of the computer-manipulated bacchanal as it will appear on
American screens.
</P>
<P>
   To put it bluntly, it looks like junk. Rather than rub out or
fuzzy-focus the naughtiest couplings, computer wizards in Warner
Brothers' employ have whipped up a bunch of sexy avatars to stand
in front of them _ men in black cloaks and nude women who, whoops!,
just happen to block our view. The clip wasn't quite finished at
the screening and might look better now, but even so, it's a bad
idea. Besides being so ridiculously fake that a theater full of
critics burst into guffaws, the computer-generated figures affront
the care Kubrick took with lighting and the minute visual
adjustments he made to each scene.
</P>
<P>
   Digital humanoids do not reflect light. They do not look real.
And they do not belong in Kubrick's movie, glue-sticked onto a sex
scene just to appease the ratings board. Anything, even big red
X's, would have been preferable to this weak trickery. Better yet,
Warner Brothers might have bitten the bullet and released ``Eyes
Wide Shut'' with (gasp) an NC-17 rating not, after all, such a wild
idea for a film with a central orgy. Why was an R so necessary? To
dupe the unsuspecting masses into watching highbrow erotica? To
separate Aunt Fanny from her $8.25?
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, anyone who cares about Kubrick's legacy would pay
to see ``Eyes Wide Shut'' regardless of an NC-17 rating; and anyone
who's offended by nudity and explicit sex will still find plenty of
cause for alarm, bowdlerized stand-ins notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   R rating or no R rating, Kubrick's final film offers a
disturbing ferry ride into an ink-black sexual underworld. ``No
dream is ever just a dream,'' says Cruise's alter ego,
half-hopeful, half-shattered, in the movie's sudden close. There's
no better epitaph to Kubrick's career.

DOMESTIC TURBULENCE CLOUDS `EYES WIDE SHUT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If you men only knew,'' says a stoned Alice Harford (Nicole
Kidman) after her physician husband, Bill (Tom Cruise), tells her
that he doesn't think women act on sexual impulse, that they can't
give into adulterous depravity.
</P>
<P>
   Alice then shrinks down to the bedroom floor of her Central Park
West apartment and spins for Bill the erotic Wonderland of
infidelity she fantasized about but never committed. She's trying
to make him jealous, but she only sets her hubby up for his own
trip through the looking glass that is ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' Stanley
Kubrick's final film and his last foray into the arctic circle of
the American male subconscious.
</P>
<P>
   More like an unfinished work than any kind of obvious or
immediate masterpiece, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is a long, strange,
uncertain, and bizarre Steadi-cambulating odyssey in conjugal
paranoia, with Gyogy Ligeti's horror-film piano drip providing the
humor. It's seemingly preoccupied with Kubrick's ``The Shining''
and works more as an object of pop curiosity than as a work of
popular entertainment. (Read: It's not the onanistic Hollywood
porno you've been dying for.)
</P>
<P>
   It took an over-documented 15 months to shoot, and a hunk of the
film's intrigue has to do with the fact that the only evidence of
those days is the 155 minutes it takes for the film to unspool.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick's never been a specialist in brevity, but where before
his time warps were hung over with a cavernous, subversive quality,
``Eyes'' feels hollowed out, narrow and wandering in an
incomplete-experiment fashion. But it's hypnotic, anyway _
especially in Kubrick's exploitation of a splashy Hollywood
marriage to play games with ideas of faith and fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   A series of naked or sexually needy goddesses spring from
Alice's pot-laced fury like an anorexic-Botticelli sideshow and
welcome Bill into their libidos. He makes a nighttime house call on
a dead patient whose daughter (Marie Richardson, replacing Jennifer
Jason Leigh) breaks down before her father's deathbed and tells
Bill she's in love with him. ``You barely know me,'' he says, but
it doesn't matter, the film offers her as an emblem of the
repetitive-stress disorder of Bill's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Early, Kubrick gives us snatches of Kidman nude from the rear,
glimpses of her breasts and the dimpled small of her back. Each
woman _ and in Leelee Sobieski's case, girl _ who tries to make
herself available to Bill is a different replica of Alice, so as to
ask Bill if he still thinks women don't want to give it. ``Eyes
Wide Shut'' may be the longest, strangest man-and- wife spat ever.
</P>
<P>
   And like any love quarrel, it takes Bill the better part of 155
minutes to come around to his wife's way of thinking. But as Cruise
tells Kidman, who's at her awkward-accented, glacial and most
insinuating, that's a gross oversimplification. But it's one
complicated by Bill's obsession with Alice's never-actualized
affair with a naval officer, something Bill imagines happening as a
soft-core table-top encounter shot in silent-film blue.
</P>
<P>
   That image flickers in Bill's overheated imagination as he
spends the minutes following their argument and most of the film
wandering through mansion and hospital hallways and through the
streets of Manhattan like Kubrick's yuppie lab rat trying to find
his way to the end of this labyrinth and over the rainbow. That's
something Kubrick suggests when he has Bill wind up at a costume
shop named for Dorothy's musical wish to be in a way more exciting
place than her Depression-era farm.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas for Kubrick under these circumstances seems to be
marriage and its stagnation after nine years, and infidelity, not
divorce, is the Oz _ that fantasia you can abandon after it turns
out to be less fantastic than thought.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted by Kubrick and Frederic Raphael from German playwright
Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 novella ``Traumnovelle'' (``Dream
Story''), ``Eyes Wide Shut'' maintains a remarkable structural
faithfulness to Schnitzler's book, right down to the clan of frat
boys who bum-rush Bill on the SoHo streets. (Though, here they've
weirdly become a drunken posse of Yale meatheads who call ``fag''
to an ever-besieged Cruise.)
</P>
<P>
   But where Schnitzler's story was about the curious indiscretion
of an Austrian doctor who may be sleepwalking though the
underworlds he's moving through, Kubrick focuses the book's dreamy
vagueness into a mildly savage riff on the repression of yuppie
indulgence and the dangerousness and casual impersonality of sex.
</P>
<P>
   It's a similar distillation that David Hare made of Schnitzler's
``La Ronde,'' which became the play ``The Blue Room,'' for which
Kidman bared her butt as well as some of her best acting, also on
remote display here in a role considerably smaller than her
husband's.
</P>
<P>
   (Coincidentally, Kidman picks her fight while standing in the
threshold of their bathroom, which glows indigo behind her.)
</P>
<P>
   By the time Bill talks his lounge-piano med-school buddy Nick
(Todd Field) into giving him the password to the location of his
ultra-cryptic gigs, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' has become ghoulishly
de-eroticized and supernaturally stagy. Nick plays blindfolded at
the console of a haunted-house-y estate _ another of the film's
fits of ``Shining'' deja vu _ populated by masked men in capes and
tuxedos while topless, masked women (all of whom are built like
Kidman) engage in the nudie cotillion ritual that goes on in the
mansion's crypt-like ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick shoots all this with the slow-drag creepiness of a Russ
Meyer episode of ``Night Gallery.'' Apparently, Bill has
infiltrated the Jay McInerney Paradise of Iniquity and only an
automaton with a plumed mask can rescue him from being found out.
</P>
<P>
   The hoopla over what he sees _ doggie-styling, live-nude-girl
fondle-sessions _ as he drifts through this soulless Saturnalia
encouraged Warner Bros. to digitally insert more nude mannequins
and men in cassocks to obstruct the copulation as if the action
were pornographic.
</P>
<P>
   But there's nothing arresting about it. Kubrick doesn't play any
of this for titillation, rather to emphasize how oddly boring it
is. Old-money Manhattanites and fresh-scrubbed yuppies getting off
on watching their ilk screw anonymous has jokey implications, but
it smacks more of Kubrick's exploitative tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Bill gets caught and is forced to remove his mask in front of
all the fornicators, but when the masked automaton offers herself
as a sacrifice for him to escape unharmed, the moment is seized
with the inconsequence and staginess of a really amateur
performance of some Greek tragedy. It's as if Kubrick were aiming
for some inversion of ``The Shining'' in which Bill really wants to
be a part of this exclusive, decadently boring world, but they
don't want him. There is no metaphysical component here and any
indulgences in some sort of wild side are kept under Kubrick's
clinical thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, while bit players such as the divine Alan Cumming as
a concierge who falls madly in love with Cruise and the rhapsodic
Rade Serbedzija as the Over the Rainbow owner walk off with scenes,
Cruise and Kidman are victimized by Kubrick's refusal to let them
unwind. They both speak deliberately with torpid points of ellipsis
beached between each world.
</P>
<P>
   Try Kidman's line this way: ``If ... you ... men ... only ...
knew ,'' then multiply that by every time she and Cruise deliver a
line. Though, it's edifying that they could take Kubrick's
direction, which even turns Chris Isaak's ``Baby Did a Bad, Bad
Thing'' into commentary.
</P>
<P>
   But that, too, feels like a forced attempt to do something cool
with a couple in whom he seems to have trouble finding inspiration
and excitement. Cruise in particular appears daunted, restrained
and matter of fact, as if the dream of this adventure were lost on
him and maybe on Kubrick, too. The ambiguities recede and
everything is precisely what it looks like.

TOURNAMENT HAS FOUND AN IDENTITY WITH ESPN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nineteen years ago, upstart network ESPN televised what was then
the longest live sports telecast in TV history _ a 9-hour 17-minute
Davis Cup quarterfinal match between the US and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of coverage _ 6 hours and 32 minutes _ was devoted to
a slugfest between John McEnroe and Mats Wilander. McEnroe won,
9-7, 6-2, 15-17, 3-6, 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was less than a half-million viewers saw
arguably one of the most thrilling matches ever played.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Drysdale, a former South African Davis Cup player, wants
to change all that. Drysdale is in Boston as ESPN's play-by-play
commentator for the centennial Davis Cup. He called the
McEnroe-Wilander match for ESPN and said that the Davis Cup ``is
the best thing tennis has going for it.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's action at the Longwood Cricket Club in Brookline
features the quarterfinal match between the US and Australia, the
two countries with the most Davis Cup championships.
</P>
<P>
   The first Davis Cup match was at Longwood in 1900, when Dwight
Filley Davis, a Harvard student, challenged the world to compete in
an international tennis tournament. Only Great Britain answered the
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the tennis matches that I have seen over the years,
Davis Cup play has been the most memorable, the most exciting,''
Drysdale said.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale has been around the Davis Cup since the early 60s when
he played for South Africa. He said the Davis Cup format should be
changed to build a larger following. Instead of playing the matches
over the course of a year, Drysdale said the tournament should be
completed within a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a workable solution,'' he said. ``Hopefully it'll
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between ESPN and the Davis Cup has been
mutually beneficial. Over the years, ESPN's coverage has helped
rekindle interest in the Davis Cup, especially when John McEnroe
and Jimmy Connors, two of America's most impetuous players,
competed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, for instance, McEnroe played Boris Becker in another
memorable shootout. ESPN was scheduled to carry the US Women's Open
golf tournament, but rain suspended play. ESPN switched to the
Davis Cup, and stayed for six hours until the final point at 11:20
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The match was only seen in 874,000 homes, but for those who
watched, it was a patriotic scene. McEnroe was an underdog,
competing against the awesome young Becker. ``ESPN has treated the
Cup very royally,'' Drysdale said.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis Cup is one of the few international sporting events
that American teams have competed in on a regular basis. ``America
is so parochial when it comes to sports,'' Drysdale said.
``Football, baseball, basketball, they are all pretty much played
here with limited international involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   With Pete Sampras playing only doubles, Drysdale said the US has
a 50-50 chance of beating the Australians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US has their best player sitting on the bench,'' Drysdale
said. ``I understand all of the reasons, but I'm disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale stressed the importance of the first singles match
between American Todd Martin and 18-year-old Lleyton Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can win that first match, I like the US's chances,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale will call the match along with Patrick McEnroe, Fred
Stolle, and courtside reporter Mal Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The first televised match is (July 16) at 2 p.m. The second
singles match is on ESPN2 at 4 p.m. ESPN will also air the doubles
match Saturday at 5 p.m. and a singles match on Sunday at 3 p.m.

   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Bjorn Borg is rising, higher and higher,
above a tennis court in Stockholm. Up he goes . . . then down, to
be caught in a blanket . . . and then up, pitched toward the
ceiling again. Over and over, as the usually restrained Swedish
crowd roars with delight and the pitchers _ his comrades in
groundstrokes _ grin impishly and give him one more toss.
</P>
<P>
   This celebratory hurling is called a hissening. It is 1975, just
after the 19-year-old Borg has almost singlehandedly defeated
Czechoslovakia, 3-2, to earn Sweden the first of its seven Davis
Cups.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden has just joined a victors' club that had been limited to
the United States, Australia, Great Britain, and France before
1974, when South Africa won by default over India. (The Indian
government, protesting apartheid, refused permission for its team
to partake of the championship round.)
</P>
<P>
   But a year later, after a genuine final, Sweden is in the
exclusive lineup. All through the night the Swedes and their guests
will guzzle champagne from the venerable tub, making another
stopover in its global wandering that began in 1903. To the victors
go the hangovers.
</P>
<P>
   Who could have imagined at the sterling basin's 1900 unveiling
on two unbearably hot August afternoons in Boston that the trophy _
dubbed ``Dwight's pot'' by the donor's good-natured cronies _ would
be so determinedly and passionately pursued around the planet for a
century and counting? Probably not even Dwight Filley Davis
himself, a rich Harvard kid who paid jeweler Shreve Crump &AMP; Low
about $1,000 to hatch his dream.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, his silver brainchild, conceived in the hope of
advancing international sportsmanship and understanding through a
game, has been on the go incessantly, growing in stature,
spiritually and physically. With the names of the final-round
players annually engraved thereon, Dwight's baby has enlarged from
the Cup itself to encompass a tray holding it and then raised atop
an ever-expanding base. His infant has put on years and inches.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding with it is the legend, the litany of wins and losses,
joys and sorrows that go with playing for your country and being
caught up in nationalism, champagne, and tears. There are stories
of no-names becoming kings-for-a-weekend by adrenalizing to
momentous victories _ such as Ecuadorans Miguel Olvera and Pancho
Guzman beating the US in 1967. Or big names being cut down to
serfdom, succumbing to the pressures of a debut _ such as Pete
Sampras tumbling at Lyon in 1991 as France jolted the US.
</P>
<P>
   Or even the tragic surrender to the burden of carrying his
country's colors suffered by 26-year-old Jiro Satoh, Japan's
finest, in 1934. Although he had led the Japanese to the semifinals
the prior year, Satoh continued to be despondent over that 3-2 loss
to Australia. On the way to England for a season-opening Cup
encounter, he leaped from a ship into the Strait of Malacca,
leaving a suicide note: ``I would have been unable to help . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Ralston, a Cup winner both as US player and captain,
says, ``Even if your country doesn't know or care that you're
representing it, you do. It's a big load, but a great one.''
</P>
<P>
   No fiercer competitor has lived than Pancho Gonzalez, who played
merely two singles matches for the US, winning both in the 1949
victory over Australia. Yet he remembered, ``I was never so nervous
before a match. Couldn't sleep. I was scared to lose when I was
playing for the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two years ago, eight years before Borg was flung skyward
within the Kungliga Hallen, the pitchers in Guayaquil were throwing
rocks _ over the fence enclosing the small stadium. The missiles
were landing on the court where Ecuador's unknown Guzman and Olvera
were perpetrating perhaps the Cup's hugest upset, 3-2 over a US
team stocked with four world-class guys: Arthur Ashe, Cliff Richey,
Marty Riessen, and Clark Graebner. It wasn't an anti-American
demonstration. The rock chuckers were angry because the joint was
sold out and they couldn't get in to witness the miracle wrought by
their otherwise ordinary compatriots.
</P>
<P>
   It is a beautiful feature of Davis Cup and its best-of-five
format of four singles matches and a doubles _ devised by Davis's
Boston mentor, Dr. James Dwight _ that a small country with only
two players can overturn the largest.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This happens over and over again in a competition in which
reputations and computer rankings mean zilch once the firing
begins. Ask Sampras about Cup jitters. Ask another great, Stefan
Edberg, who while ranked No. 1 in 1992 was beaten by No. 238,
Canadian rookie Daniel Nestor. Or an American top-10 guy, Jimmy
Arias, beaten by No. 282 Hugo Chapacu as the US crumbled in, of all
places, Paraguay in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Their numbers are legion. They are all part of the fun and
tension of a competition that sprung from a humble start at the
corner of Brookline and Longwood avenues _ the original Longwood
Cricket Club _ 99 years ago as three Brits battled three Harvard
dudes. Formally, it was the British Isles vs. the United States in
the inaugural competition for the expensive hardware that the
modest Davis had baptized ``International Lawn Tennis Challenge
Trophy.'' Fortunately for headline writers, and scribblers and
babblers like me, it was soon to be referred to as the just plain
(though ornate) Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
   From an event matching two countries to one now involving 129
(eight currently remaining in the elite World Group), Dwight's baby
has come a long way, all right. And the countries that have made
the most of the bauble's journeying _ Australia and the US _ are
ready to pounce for a 45th time. Appropriately, this happens in the
100th year of the priceless Cup (insured for $250,000 but
considered unduplicable) at the (sort of) birthplace, a relocated
Longwood just up the road.
</P>
<P>
   Aussies and Yanks. They are the Montagues and the Capulets in a
netted rectangle _ but with a smile and a handshake after the
uncompromising feud. Twenty-nine times they've clashed in the title
round _ the Aussies lead, 15-14, although the US leads the overall
series, 25-19, going back to 1905. The victor of this weekend's
quarterfinal will next play the Russia-Slovakia survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Australia is a country the size of the US but population poor.
For the first five of its 26 triumphs, the island of only a few
million had to rely on help from another island, New Zealand. The
team, called Australasia, was manned by Norman Brookes, a
lefthander from Melbourne, and the dashing Tony Wilding from
Christchurch. Wilding was a pre-Hell's Angels hog-riding hunk whose
four-year Wimbledon reign was ended by Brookes in 1914, a year
before his life was ended in France by World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Even by 1939, the last Cup in the life of Davis _ who died in
1945 after a civic-minded career (Secretary of War,
Governor-General of the Philippines), there were only about 5
million Aussies. Nevertheless, that was the year of their unique
two-man triumph, 3-2, over the US in Philadelphia. Down, 0-2, after
the opening day, Adrian Quist and John Bromwich rebounded to take
the doubles over 18-year-old Jack Kramer and Joe Hunt, who would
win the US title in 1943, then die at 25 as a Naval pilot in World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a confusing time,'' recalls Bromwich, now 80 and living
in Port Lonsdale, outside Melbourne. ``We'd made the three-week
boat trip to California, then taken a train to the East Coast. A
day before the matches, war was declared. We were in it and didn't
know if we should even play, but were given approval.''
</P>
<P>
   Bromwich lives quietly, beset by several diseases yet cheerful,
and looking forward to the telecast of this weekend's engagement
even though it begins at 2 a.m. Saturday Down Under. As curious as
a duckbilled platypus in his tennis style, Brom, a lefthander,
served righty and struck a southpaw forehand but used both hands on
the other side, a distinct oddity in that ante-Evert-Borg-Connors
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd won the US Doubles at Longwood,'' Bromwich recounts, ``so
we were confident of beating Kramer and Hunt, a new pairing. On the
third day, Quisty told me he'd beat (Bobby) Riggs if I'd promise to
follow up by beating (Frank) Parker. That's just what happened,
although his was close, five sets. I won in straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Never before or since has the Cup been won from 0-2. ``We were
very proud,'' says Bromwich. ``Not only because we hadn't won for
25 years, but this was the first time it was just Australia, no
longer Australasia.''

MOCKUMENTARY DOES GOOD HORROR ON A BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT 
Written and directed by: Edouardo Sanchez, Dan Myrick 
Starring: Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, Joshua Leonard 
Running time: 87 minutes 
Rated: R (language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood is going to be throwing a lot of high-budget horror at
us in the weeks ahead. But it's easy to believe that when all the
dust settles, a low-budget mock documentary, ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' will be remembered as the scariest of them all. Like so
many truly effective horror movies _ ``Night of the Living Dead,''
``Texas Chainsaw Massacre,'' ``Last House on the Left'' _ it's both
cheesy and primal. It's as primal as it is partly because it's so
cheesy and minimalist. And it shrewdly substitutes dread for gore.
The film, by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, is a long improv by
three young actors in the Maryland woods, playing film-school
students shooting a film about a gory local legend. They're
nervously camping out in tents, growing progressively unhinged as
they're awakened by the cries of children and unnerved by
mysterious lights and primitive artifacts hanging from trees.
</P>
<P>
   We are told that they disappeared after eight days. What we see
is said to be the footage they shot, discovered long after the
unsuccessful search for them. With ironic humor, Heather Donahue's
team leader compulsively films all their kibitzing and bickering as
they stumble deeper into the woods. En route to the Blair Witch of
legend, they learn of horrific subsequent crimes on the site,
encounter other scary things, diligently documenting all the while
their own unraveling when the dynamic crumbles as nerves and
tempers fray. Hysteria and dislocation march hand in hand until it
becomes apparent that the three are in over their heads. It begins
to dawn on them that their tight little filming schedule is a joke
and they may be in grave danger.
</P>
<P>
   As the driven director, Donahue convincingly embodies the
single-mindedness she knows she needs if the project is to be
completed. She also is aware of a male-female power situation, in
which Joshua Reynolds, the actor playing the cameraman (who
actually shot most of the film), and Michael Williams's sound man
repeatedly test her. But at a certain point it becomes clear that
power plays are irrelevant, that any idea that they are going to
wield any power or control is only an illusion. There's something
in the woods that's bigger and stronger and more malevolent than
all of them. The only questions are what it is and whether it's
going to get them, as Donahue's director compulsively camcords her
thoughts and observations to the end.
</P>
<P>
   The framing device and central conceit work almost perfectly. In
the film's last third, slack and self-consciousness set in as we
become aware that we're watching actors trying to improvise their
way through what suddenly has become dead space. When an improv
fails to rise, it's flatter than a ruined souffle, and there is a
zone where the air goes out of the faux amateurishness and
roughness. That being said, however, ``The Blair Witch Project''
rights itself with a horrifying impact that carries through to as
heart-stopping a climax as any the genre has seen in years. ``The
Blair Witch Project'' makes virtues of graininess, blurriness, and
jerky camera movements. By the end, the freak-outs and the
creepiness are as real and as terrifying as you could hope for.
``The Blair Witch Project'' casts a clammy, unnerving spell.

<P>
   Certainly the cosmopolitan Italian, Nicky Pietrangeli, who
played more Cup matches than anybody else (120-44 in 66 series from
1954-1972), found a few lire from the tooth fairy. But after
leading Italy to the finals of 1960-61, he accepted a rich contract
from pro promoter Jack Kramer. But it was soon repudiated. As
Kramer remembers, ``Nicky told me he couldn't join me after all
because Italy had raised his salary. I tore up the contract. How
could I outbid a country that cared so much for Davis Cup?''
</P>
<P>
   In '73, with probably the greatest of all teams _ Rod Laver, Ken
Rosewall, John Newcombe, Mal Anderson _ the Aussies took away the
Cup, smashing an American monopoly of five years built mainly by
Arthur Ashe, Stan Smith, and Bob Lutz. Newcombe, captaining this
weekend's Aussie team, and Laver played all the matches in a
reverberating 5-0 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   The Aussies were back, though briefly. Not like the days of
Capt. Harry Hopman, chief embalmer of the Down Undertakers. Such an
era of Cup dominance is unimaginable now, as players and their
agents run the show, subservient to no captain. Hopman, slight,
nimble, and fit _ ``with the power of life and death over us,''
recalls Fred Stolle _ knew how to train and inspire champions,
working on their pride in representing an out-of-the-way country
and beating up on the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   He won his first Cup in that 1939 Bromwich-Quist revival, gave
way to others, then was desperately summoned to the captain's chair
again in 1950 to try to dam the US post-war flood of four wins by
Jack Kramer, Ted Schroeder, and Pancho Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Presto! Blessed by a gusher of Hall of Famers named Laver,
Rosewall, Newcombe, Stolle, Frank Sedgman, Ken McGregor, Lew Hoad,
Ashley Cooper, Neale Fraser, Roy Emerson, and Tony Roche plus
Anderson, Rex Hartwig, and Mervyn Rose, Captain Hop directed the
Aussies shrewdly and won 15 more Cups, the last in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Hop's first year, 1938, he guided Australia to the final, but
Quist and Bromwich weren't up to dealing with the US, alias John
Donald Budge. Nobody was. In 1937, Budge had been a welcome
cloudburst of magnificent shot-making in busting the longest US
drought, 11 years. Don's tour de force, the five-set extravaganza
over Germany's elegant Baron Gottfried von Cramm, has been talked
and written about ever since _ the most resounding of Davis Cup
victories if the barrels of ink devoted to it are any measure.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't televised, however, so tapes of Courier's splendid
five-set decisions over Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski in April at
Birmingham, England, may be contenders. Like Courier's setting,
Budge's wasn't the final. Budge and von Cramm collided in the semis
at Wimbledon, with the winning country expected to defeat
Cup-clutching Britain (which the US did).
</P>
<P>
   Budge and his redoubtable sidekick, Gene Mako, won the doubles
for a 2-1 lead, but Henner Henkel started the third day beating
tiny Bitsy Grant. It was 2-2, leaving the verdict up to Budge and
the Baron. Budge says that just before they went onto the court von
Cramm, an avowed anti-Nazi, received a phone call from Adolph
Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gottfried kept saying, `Jah, mein fuhrer. Jah, mein fuhrer,'
'' relates Budge. ``He was being ordered to win for the fatherland
and was pale and serious. He played as if his life depended on
every point.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a touch of Davis Cup pressure, wouldn't you say? And
the Baron almost won. Later, von Cramm went to jail under
trumped-up charges, an ordeal he probably would have avoided had he
beaten Budge and grabbed the Cup for Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Budge, reeling from the loss of the first two sets, regrouped to
win the next two but was pummeled into the abyss again, 1-4, in the
fifth. At the changeover, the willowy redhead, who would score the
initial Grand Slam the following year, told US captain Walter Pate,
``Don't worry, Cap. I'll win.''
</P>
<P>
   So he did, 6-8, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 8-6, although von Cramm kept the
suspense going by canceling five match points. Budge never saw the
last _ a running, diving forehand winner that landed Don on his
face.
</P>
<P>
   Budge, 84, still reveres his close friendship with von Cramm,
whom he calls ``an unsurpassed sportsman. After I beat him, he
said, `Don, that's the finest match I've ever played.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the sportsmanship spectrum, Budge also
enjoys a friendship with John McEnroe. ``John was such a great
player,'' said Budge, ``and I liked the way he was always ready to
play Davis Cup even when others weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe, a two-way wizard who often handled both the singles and
doubles, played more years (12) and series (30) than any other
American. He was 41-8 in singles, 18-2 in doubles, and had a solid
left hand in five Cups from 1978-1992, a US longevity mark. Fred
Stolle is among those who believe Mac, even at 40, should have been
selected for this match's doubles alongside Sampras, with whom he
combined for two wins, including the 1992 final.
</P>
<P>
   When you talk about sportsmanship, amid all the conniving that
goes on in court surface selection and making the most of home site
advantage, the name of Ed Turville, winning US captain in 1970-71,
shouldn't be overlooked. Romania, with Ilie Nastase and Ion Tiriac,
fought to the '71 final in Charlotte, N.C. And Turville, while he
wanted to win, also wanted ``a good, entertaining match for the
fans, something good for tennis.'' He felt the 5-0 US win over the
Romanians in 1969 on a souped-up hard court in Cleveland had been
one-sidedly dull, unfair. ``The Romanians are used to clay, so
we'll play on clay,'' said Turville.
</P>
<P>
   Promptly his best player, Cliff Richey, quit the team, calling
Turville a traitor who'd given the Cup away. The Romanians were
ecstatic and confident. Turville, needing a body, went searching
and found a retread, spidery 28-year-old Frank Froehling, who
hadn't been on the team in six years. Froehling, from two sets
down, beat Tiriac, 8-6, in the fifth, and Stan Smith, no happy
camper on dirt, upset Nastase. The US won and Turville is still
smiling, believing that sportsmen can win.
</P>
<P>
   Smith proved that many times over with his big right hand in
helping the US win seven Cups _ same as Tilden _ never more so than
in Bucharest in 1972, my nomination for greatest US performance
overseas and in a hostile environment. Too bad there are no tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Bucharest was a very drab, sad place, life hard under the thumb
of the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. But those two men, Nastase and
Tiriac, gave their countrymen great pride. People lined up for
blocks and paid 10 cents to view the Cup on display in a downtown
store. Nastase had guaranteed the hopeful that it would stay in
Romania.
</P>
<P>
   No problem, thought Nastase. This was crimson European clay,
slowed for the weekend to mire the Americans, and Nasty was the
world's boss on that stuff. Smith was even less sure than he'd been
sliding on the Charlotte version. Much of it was out of giraffeian
Stan's control because the local umpires and line judges were super
patriots. Realizing he had to smack winners well within the lines,
Stan did just that to save a set point while beating Nastase in
three and Tiriac in an enthralling five sets to clinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I concentrated so hard I had a headache for days,'' Smith
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than a headache that Patricio Cornejo suffered when
Chile had its chance of a lifetime, the 1976 final against Adriano
Panatta's Italians. It occurred in Santiago, where a bugler
constantly ran up and down the stadium steps, rallying the crowd.
Alas, the first day's singles went badly for the Chileans. Cornejo
and Jaime Fillol were beaten by Corrado Barazzutti and Panatta,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The second night was worse. Not because the Chileans had lost
the doubles, but because Cornejo almost lost his life. Heart attack
in the hotel. When help arrived at his room, the doctors found him
fully dressed in tennis gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to die,'' he said. ``I wanted to go as a
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis Cuppers would understand.

YOU CUT YOUR LETTUCE? OH, NO!

   When in France, eat as the French do. And that goes for other
countries around the globe, too. Here, from Travel Holiday, are
examples of how table etiquette can change with geography:
</P>
<P>
   --In France, never cut your lettuce. Instead, use your knife and
fork to fold the leaves into bite-sized pieces. And don't order
soft drinks with your meal. That's considered close to barbaric.
</P>
<P>
   --In India and Malaysia, it's all right to eat with your hand _
but not your hands. You pass dishes with the left hand but eat with
the right only.
</P>
<P>
   --Slurping soup or noodles in Japan shows appreciation, not
rudeness. It is rude, however, to refill your own glass; dining
partners take turns refilling one another's. And finally, you'll
insult the cook if you put soy sauce on your white rice.
</P>
<P>
   Travel Trivia: In which of these cities would you be most likely
to find a philocubist: Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Boston, or
Orlando? (Answer at end of column.)
</P>
<P>
   In a name: In Korea, you can buy Independence Cola, with the
numbers 815 writ large on the can or bottle. (Korea's independence
day is on 8/15.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking of Independence Day: We learn from Old Sturbridge
Village that the Fourth of July was so important to 19th-century
New Englanders that they did what would be unthinkable on any other
summer day _ interrupted haying and other farm work to celebrate.
Just how joyously they celebrated will be made evident in special
events at the village today.
</P>
<P>
   Quotable: ``It'd be a great country if it had a roof over it!''
_ comedian Noel V. Ginnity, on Ireland. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's loopy law: You need a $5 permit to go barefoot in Texas. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Advice to go (and we do mean go): You're on vacation or on the road
and you need a doctor, have a health question, lose a prescription,
or suffer from an illness such as, ahem, diarrhea. Kmart Corp. and
the makers of Immodium are sponsoring a toll-free number _
800-866-0086 _ that lets you speak to a pharmacist. Last year the
most frequently asked questions concerned lost prescriptions,
potential drug interactions, diarrhea (the most common vacation
ailment), and how to find a physician in the area. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? Las Vegas. A philocubist is a dice player. &QL;

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 BROOKLINE, Mass.: ... longer Australasia.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brookes, the early stalwart who'd become head man of Australian
tennis, carted the Cup back to Melbourne, where it languished in a
bank vault for seven years of war until the tournament resumed _
and Yanks Jack Kramer and Ted Schroeder lifted it. There was an
eerie air to the '39 Aussie triumph, saddened in retrospect by
Hunt's wartime death, a postscript to KIA Wilding in World War I.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century before, on the eve of that war, Brookes and
Wilding defeated the US, 3-2, at New York. Wilding, then 31, was
playing the last tennis of his bright young life before being
killed in combat. He led off by beating Dick Williams, the miracle
man of tennis. A Longwood member, Williams had somehow braved icy
waters for six hours in surviving the Titanic sinking 28 months
previously, and would become a valorous warrior himself in the US
Army. But Brookes prevailed on this day, and the Cup moved Down
Under for a long wartime stay at his home. It was such a casual
addition to the Brookes household that his wife used it as a flower
pot.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Redl, a soldier in the German Army, was luckier than Joe
Hunt and multitudes of others in World War II. He lost an arm, but
it was his left _ and Hans was a righthander playing for Austria
before the war. Was his Cup career over? Nein. One-armed, he was
even better, posting 3-10 singles and 3-8 doubles marks. In 1947,
at age 33, he made the fourth round at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable comeback, but Cup history is packed with them,
loaded with guys who, as Davis Cup maestro Jim Courier said
Thursday, ``either play way above or below their standard. It's
rare when somebody maintains his normal standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Above is why Arnaud Boetsch _ who? _ was riding in an open
convertible along the Champs-Elysees in 1996 as 100,000 Parisians
cheered him and his teammates madly, and the president of France
awaited with personal congratulations. Boetsch, one of the more
improbable Davis Cup weekend wonders _ guys super-charged by the
occasion, or overcome _ had given France its eighth Cup as a
Houdini in short pants. Only once in all the years of these
best-of-five match series has a man in the ultimate match, the
fifth, escaped Cup points to win. Boetsch, not to be heard from
again, is that man.
</P>
<P>
   With all Sweden anticipating a home triumph at Malmo as Nicklas
Kulti needed but 1 point to seize the sterling prize, Boetsch
somehow wriggled out of triple Cup point _ serving at 6-7, 0-40 _
to win, 7-6 (7-2), 2-6, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 10-8, in 4 hours 47
minutes. They'll probably put stubby Arnaud in the Pantheon when he
dies.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, France has nurtured numerous fine players. A bloc of
them known as the Four Musketeers _ Renee Lacoste, Henri Cochet,
Jean Borotra, and Jacques Brugnon _ emerged in the 1920s to wrest
the spotlight and the Cup away from the man who symbolized it in
the US, having turned American attention toward tennis: Big Bill
Tilden.
</P>
<P>
   Tilden, imperious, cool, and a late-maturing, stroke-making
virtuoso in long flannels, led the US to the Antipodes in 1920 to
recover the Cup in New Zealand. He was 27 and had just won the
first of six straight US titles. He and his countryman and usual
rival, Little Bill Johnston, beat Brookes and Australasia, and kept
winning and winning until the US streak lengthened to a record
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   After two final-round misses, the French caught up and paid the
Bills back, 3-2, in 1927. ``It took four of us to beat Beeg Beel,''
said Lacoste, who brought down Tilden to deadlock the series at
2-2. Whereupon Cochet beat Johnston as Lacoste and Tilden sat
together watching Big Bill's empire disintegrate. Borotra and
Brugnon had done their softening-up part well, pushing Tilden to
five sets in doubles (with Frank Hunter), though losing.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, these magnetic Gallic guys, each with a widely known
nickname, took over. ``The Crocodile'' Lacoste, ``Toto'' Brugnon,
``Bounding Basque'' Borotra, and the diminutive Cochet, ``the
Ballboy of Lyon,'' created a tennis version of their country's
Reign of Terror, holding on to the Cup for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lacoste, designer of the universally adopted
short-sleeved polo shirt (still around, bearing his reptilian
logo), retired soon, the momentum continued until Britain's last
championship gasp. Fred Perry and Bunny Austin took over in 1933
for a four-year run that might be called Roper Barrett's Revenge.
</P>
<P>
   You see, Herbert Roper Barrett had been one of those Englishmen
_ ``the Dauntless Three,'' London newspapers called them _ who had
accepted that challenge from the US in 1900 and had stepped onto
Longwood sod, much to their distress. They were undaunted sports
who had picked up their own tabs. You couldn't find anybody to play
today, in this professional era, if that precedent of 1900
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans this weekend are getting in the neighborhood of
100 grand from the US Tennis Association, and the Aussies won't
starve, either. But Brits Roper Barrett, Arthur Gore, and Ernest
Black paid their own way on steam ships to and from a 3-0 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they showed a certain inquisitiveness that would seem
odd to campaigners today. Black, Gore, and Roper Barrett decided to
explore. They took the long way 'round to Boston _ a train journey
to gawk at wondrous Niagara Falls _ and arrived at Longwood just a
day before before the hostilities were to begin, with time for only
a brief practice.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing all that cascading water may have prepared the Brits for
the soaking they got from the Harvard Three _ Davis, Malcolm
Whitman, and Holcombe Ward. They didn't know what hit them, because
they couldn't hit the wildly spinning and bounding ``American
twist'' serves, new to their experience, a weapon developed by the
stubby Ward and common nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a tall lefty, was the US captain. After all, it was his
idea and Cup, wasn't it? He lost the opening set to Black, but
after that the American procession was on for nine straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   The Brits, who had come far to show the Colonials how the game
should be played, moaned and groaned about the lousy courts, balls,
and net _ and the casual attitude of their hosts in insisting on
taking a break after each set. The tourists were probably right.
However, Roper Barrett did salute the gathering of 1,200, saying
that ``the female portion was not unpleasant to gaze upon'' _ more
smashing than the Brits' performance.
</P>
<P>
   Men in suits and hats, and women in long gowns, hats, and
parasols filled a covered stand ($2.50 for shade). The remainder of
the seats in the searing sun cost $1, for which at the time you
could also purchase five pounds of coffee or 12 pounds of lamb, or
even a bottle of Dr. William Brown's White River Remedy that
``cures drunkenness.''
</P>
<P>
   Not finding a cure for the weekend grogginess induced by the
Colonials' serves, Roper Barrett did acknowledge, ``Their game is
too hard for us.'' But, 33 years after, sweet revenge. He found a
way to win from the bench as the captain of Britain's four-time
champs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the three-quarters of a century between the Cup's christening
and Borg's high-flying hissening, the event had attracted adherents
and players on every continent but Antarctica, where the penguins
tend to incur tennis elbow flapping for fish.
</P>
<P>
   It went professional in 1973, a traumatic year for some in that
the final became a hothouse presentation, inside Cleveland's Public
Hall. Iconoclastic promoter Bob Malaga had previously shocked
tennis purists by staging the 1964 final on Cleveland clay,
declaring that sod was dead. His abandonment of grass, after all 20
title rounds in this country had been played on the sod, was one
thing. But then Malaga took away fresh air. Now indoor finals are
routine.
</P>
<P>
   If Davis Cuppers desired to earn cash from tennis before 1968,
they had to turn pro, whereupon they were barred from the
substantial events. Obviously, some of the alleged amateurs in more
realistic, practical Europe received stipends to play for the
homeland.

MORE DIVERSIFICATION, AND PLEASE, NO MORE DELL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 18, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 34 and self-employed. I have a wife and two kids and
plan on retiring when I reach age 50 with $5 million in assets. I
currently have $81,000 in a SEP-IRA invested in stock mutual funds,
an additional $50,000 in taxable mutual fund accounts, and $263,500
in nine common stocks, with the portfolio dominated by $210,000 in
Dell Computer. I currently make in excess of $200,000 a year and
contribute $22,500 to the SEP account annually. I also invest
$3,000 a month in various stocks. Do I have the right
diversification, and will I meet my target?
</P>
<P>
   K.B., Orion, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   A. The computer shows you would fall less than $1 million shy of
your target, presuming you continued saving at your current rate of
$4,875 a month and that your investment returns averaged 10 percent
a year. And since more than half your savings is going into taxable
accounts, you would have to find other money to pay any tax
liabilities resulting from those investments just to get to the
$4,014,011 projection.
</P>
<P>
   The computer shows that the sequence of equal savings payments
required to get you to $5 million over 16 years calls for $7,068 a
month, more than 42 percent of your pretax income, which is more
than most of us can save.
</P>
<P>
   My first suggestion is this: Since your current savings
represents 29.25 percent of your income, maintain your savings at
that percentage level, adjusting the amount of dollar savings each
year as your income changes.
</P>
<P>
   Second, look into variable annuity accounts so as to defer the
tax liability on the growth of your savings. A very efficient
variable annuity account, to my way of thinking, is one offered by
Vanguard which invests its assets so as to track the Standard and
Poor's 500 index. Because of a small insurance element which is
required to get the tax deferral, returns tend to run one-half of 1
percentage point less than Vanguard's Index 500 fund.
</P>
<P>
   Your fund portfolio is reasonably well diversified, although I
like to see some representation of heatlh care and technology
sector funds in addition to the large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap and
international growth funds you are now using. But that huge
position in Dell Computer, currently representing more than half of
your total savings, renders any discussion of diversification a
little silly. Yes, Dell's a great company, and I'm guessing that
you've held this position so long that you can't sell without
turning a tidy amount of the proceeds over to Uncle Sam. But for
goodness sake, don't buy any more.
</P>
<P>
   On the fund side, besides the sector funds, I'd like to see you
bump up the holdings in Oppenheimer Enterprise, your small-cap
fund, and in Putnam International Growth and Oppenheimer
International Growth.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, to get to a broader diversification, I'd direct at
least two-thirds of your non-IRA savings to the fund portfolio
rather than to the stock portfolio. Your stock selections are solid
_ besides Dell, you have WalMart, Home Depot, Microsoft and similar
issues. But putting most of your savings into individual stocks is
not an approach which will lead to broad diversification. Remember,
the markets of the last couple of years have been very kind to the
kind of individual stocks you hold, but markets come and go, and in
the long run you'll be better served with a broader portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How does an investor balance a 401(k), IRA and additional
investments? I am 34 and contribute 20 percent of my gross income
to my 401(k), which has five investment options. I do not
contribute to a Stable Value fund or a US Treasury securities fund.
I put 10 percent into Vanguard Wellington, 50 percent in Vanguard
Total Stock Market Index, 30 percent in Vanguard U.S. Growth, and
10 percent in Vanguard International Growth. Is this the best
distribution for my long-term goal of retiring at age 60? I also am
interested in opening a Roth IRA. Should I view this IRA as a
separate portfolio or as part of my 401(k). I would like to begin
the Roth with an investment in Vanguard's Index 500. Also, should I
open the account with the minimum $1,000 and then use dollar-cost
averaging to reach the $2,000 maximum? Finally, I would like to
invest toward buying a house and retirement. What's best?
</P>
<P>
   D.G., Chula Vista, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. To start with the 401(k), I think you've made about the best
you can of a pretty skimpy menu. Since all of the funds you're
using except the international offering concentrate on large-cap
domestic stocks, it's important to view your 401(k), your Roth IRA,
and your proposed taxable account _ all of which are earmarked for
retirement _ as elements of a single retirement program.
</P>
<P>
   And since you will be setting up the Roth IRA and the taxable
account on your own, you can use these vehicles to make up for some
of the shortcomings of the 401(k) menu. Since you already have that
heavy concentration on domestic large-cap stocks, you probably
won't want either Vanguard's Index 500 or its LifeStrategy Growth
funds, since both of them would just be buying you more of the
same.
</P>
<P>
   If I were you I would put the Roth IRA _ where the money will be
tax free once it's finally withdrawn _ in an investment where you
might reasonably expect to achieve your greatest growth. My
suggestion would be Fidelity Select Health Care, moving from
Vanguard only because that company has closed its excellent heath
care offering. In the taxable account, I would begin with
Vanguard's Small-Cap Index, and in subsequent years add its Mid-Cap
Index fund. These moves, when taken together with the 401(k)
holdings, will give you a lot more diversification among market
sectors than you could ever achieve through the 401(k) menu.
</P>
<P>
   To dollar-cost average or not? My approach when you're dealing
with an IRA account is to consider that a regularly-funded IRA is
inherently a dollar-cost averaging discipline from the start. I
would probably decide how you're going to fund it next year _ with
a lump sum or by contributing $166 a month. If the former, I'd go
ahead with the lump sum to open the account. If the latter, I'd
start with the $1,000 contribution and distribute the final $1,000
among what's left of this year and then pick up on the $166-a-month
discipline at the start of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the proper investment for your real estate savings
depends on how long you think it will take before you're ready to
buy. If it's likely to take you about a decade to save the down
payment, I'd use Vanguard GNMA as my initial savings vehicle. If
it's a closer to five years, you might use a very conservative bond
fund such as Vanguard Short-Term Corporate.

STOLLE IS AUSTRALIA'S RISING SON

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Sandon Stolle sits alongside the court at
Longwood Cricket Club, watching Pete Sampras and Alex O'Brien _
members of the American Davis Cup team _ hit balls to one another.
His attention is diverted to his own left arm, where the symbol of
a phoenix is tattooed near his shoulder blade. His voice grows
quieter and more cautious, but still he discusses his rise from the
depths of tennis frustration _ which at one point had him convinced
he was through with the sport _ to the peak of becoming the fourth
and final member of the Australian Davis Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   When the year began, Stolle knew he wanted to be a part of the
Davis Cup. The feeling of camaraderie in team tennis intrigues him,
so he wanted to play a part, no matter how small. Last week, after
successful doubles competitor Todd Woodbridge announced his
withdrawal, Stolle was named the replacement, promoting him from
practice partner to participant in the historic tie, the second
year in a row he has risen from the shadows to take center stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennis is a funny game,'' said the 29-year-old Stolle. ``Sport
is in general. You think you're through with it and you've had
enough, and then you hit a vault and you're back in love with it.
Just live day by day and enjoy it while you're on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Stolle has garnered world rankings as high as 50 in singles play
and 14 in doubles. Last year, paired with Cyril Suk, he won the US
Open doubles title. This year he made his third Davis Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   Stolle has enjoyed much success in professional tennis _ a game
he was taught by his father, Australian legend Fred Stolle _ but he
has had to wade through a pool of injuries and disappointment
before any of it set in.
</P>
<P>
   He should be used to it, though. The script read almost exactly
as it did when he was playing as a junior.
</P>
<P>
   Stolle is a late bloomer in the world of tennis, a sport in
which Jennifer Capriati enjoyed professional success at age 15.
Stolle was struggling in juniors at the same age.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a kid and you don't really know what's going on and you
wind up at a tournament as Fred Stolle's son,'' he said. ``But as
years go on people know you for who you are, and I think I've made
a little name for myself now. And people, they're never going to
compare me to what my dad did _ he had so many incredible
achievements. To me, tennis has been great to my family and myself,
and I'm just going to appreciate all the days I have playing.''
</P>
<P>
   At 15, Stolle attended Harry Hopman's tennis camp, and his life
changed. He played tennis every day until it got dark, and suddenly
he started winning. Suddenly a sport that had never been a top
priority became fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was definitely a late developer as far as not being the best
junior player, and it definitely wasn't the No. 1 thing I wanted to
do,'' he said. ``I just hit a vault along the way, which was a
great thing, and when I saw my window of opportunity, I took it.''
</P>
<P>
   That vault didn't last long, though. His skills got him a
scholarship to Texas Christian, where he played for two years,
earning All-America honors in 1990. He moved back to Australia and
turned pro. Stolle finished his first year ranked tied for 813th.
He realized then that this was going to be a long road. And it was.
He didn't crack the top 200 for another two years (1991) and the
top 100 until 1992. He finished the year No. 71 and was poised for
a run at the top 50.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't find his stroke, though, and despite enjoying minor
successes, Stolle finished 199, 182, and 182 over the next three
years, respectively. He was confused. He worked hard, played hard _
did all the things that had brought him to success when he was
younger.
</P>
<P>
   That was the first time the thought crossed his mind: I want
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all have those times,'' he said. ``I've had a few
injuries through the years that I've been playing and a lot of ups
and downs. I remember sitting down with dad _ on I know one
occasion but probably twice _ and saying, `I don't know if this is
what I want to do anymore. I've had enough.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But his father convinced him to stay in the game. It was a tough
sell for someone who was never completely focused on tennis in the
first place. When he had trouble breaking into the junior circuit,
the outdoors would call louder than the tennis court. He wanted to
ski or hike or snowboard or just sit in the mountains and think.
Now, here he was, falling on hard times again at a place where he
was forcing himself to be. His mind and heart, he thought, were
ready to let go. So why come back?
</P>
<P>
   ``There didn't seem to be a reason to,'' he said. ``But then I
come into contact with a few people along the way that sort of
inspired me to have another crack at it. And that's what it's all
about: coming across these people that can all of a sudden change
your outlook.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of these people was his physical trainer back in
Australia in 1996, Brett Stephens, with whom he no longer works but
maintains a strong friendship. Stephens, who plays Australian Rules
Football, clicked with Stolle's love for the outdoors. They had a
common bond, and over the next 2 1/2 years, Stephens was able to
completely turn Stolle's career around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really got me thinking in ways I hadn't thought before and
he really got a lot out of me for 2 1/2 years, where I felt like I
was going to play,'' Stolle remembers.
</P>
<P>
   Stolle finished 58th in 1996, and after climbing as high as 50
in 1997, he finished the year at 84. Things were going well. But
not half as well as they would in 1998, when he won two tournaments
and made the quarterfinals at three others.
</P>
<P>
   But he soon noticed an ache in his arm. He thought it was just
wear and tear, so he didn't think too much of it until he started
having more trouble and his ranking began to drop. When he finally
went to see a doctor, he found out it was a stress fracture.
Translation: six months away from tennis, just when he was starting
to catch fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was having my best year yet,'' Stolle said. ``I was still
working with Brett and I got up to top 50 in singles, and then that
was it. I got injured, played half the year, and was out. After all
of that, I was out.''
</P>
<P>
   Those six months were quite long. So long, in fact, that those
thoughts began creeping back. Was it time to leave?
</P>
<P>
   If it was a hard sell to bring him back before, it would be
virtually impossible this time. But he met a young woman whose name
was too personal to reveal, he said. This spiritual girl gave him
another outlook on tennis _ and on life itself. By the time he was
back from injury, he was ready to take on the world. Which he did,
at the US Open, and emerged successful in doubles play.
</P>
<P>
   He looks down at the tattoo once more and touches it. The symbol
was on a ring that he wore through the Open. It offered comfort and
protection. When he went into the finals of the Open, he told
himself he would have it with him permanently if he won. That
night, he celebrated the win by attending a Pearl Jam concert at
Madison Square Garden. But afterward he went home and got the
tattoo. As for the ring, he passed it along to his cousin in
Australia, who was going through some tough times herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play these matches and sometimes you get so involved that
it means everything,'' Stolle said. ``It is why you are happy when
you win and not so when you lose. The phoenix is a symbol that sort
of looked over me when I was going through a tough time. So when I
won, I got the tatoo.''
</P>
<P>
   The symbol of Stolle's career should be a tattoo of a roller
coaster. Tennis went from something he had to do to something he
wanted to do when he was young. His career went from the 800s to
the 100s and back again before he finally captured his first Grand
Slam. He has gone from practice partner for the Davis Cup to a team
member. A team member who will be vital to the Aussie's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can win regardless of who we put on the court
because, just as far as Australian history goes, maybe we're not
the better players _ but we just have spirit when we come together
and everyone just fights for everything,'' he said. ``It's all
everyone knows to do.''

`TOURNEY' POINTLESS FOR US TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN _ This is and will be a tournament for second place. No
one is making any suggestions to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   This so-called pre-Olympic qualifying tournament amounts to a
glorified, 10-game exhibition for the United States and a scrum for
everyone else. Two teams will emerge from this tournament to
qualify for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. The US will be one and
good luck figuring out the second, although the Puerto Rican hosts
may have the edge. Why the United States has to even go through the
motions is a matter that the powers of international basketball
ought to revisit.
</P>
<P>
   At some point down the road, although it doesn't appear it will
be anytime soon, a country may emerge with a basketball program to
rival that of the United States. Yugoslavia was getting there until
politics and war got in the way. The USSR was getting there until
nationalism and perestroika got in the way. Now, there is no one.
</P>
<P>
   If that point needed to be driven home, it was done last summer
in a most roundabout way. The United States was scheduled to send
an NBA team to the world championships in Athens for what would
have been an easy gold medal and an automatic berth in Sydney. But
the lockout intervened and the players stayed away. Even still,
with a team assembled at the 11th hour and composed mostly of CBA
players, the US still almost won the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   That they didn't meant they'd have to come here to finish the
job and officially qualify for Sydney. It's the equivalent of
sending Duke or UConn to the Indiana High School tournament. Many
NBA scouts and general managers aren't even bothering to attend,
convinced that it isn't worth the time. There's not even CBA talent
here.
</P>
<P>
   After Arnold Palmer won one of his British Opens, he suggested
to the Royal &AMP; Ancient folks that it might be a good idea if the
defending champ was treated differently and spared the rigors of
qualifying, which everyone had to do back then. The R&AMP;A considered
the matter, looked at Palmer's popularity, and said, ``sure.''
Since then, the British Open champ has been exempted.
</P>
<P>
   Why that isn't the case with the Olympics is a mystery, made
even more so by the byzantine rules governing the qualifying
process as well as the ongoing dominance of the Yanks. The host
country gets an automatic berth, but the defending Olympic champ
doesn't?
</P>
<P>
   There simply is no reason why Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, and the
rest of these gents should have to try and get psyched to walk over
their brethren from the Americas and earn a berth. But over the
next 10 days, Puerto Rican hoop fans (and basketball krishnas in
the US via TNT) will have the opportunity to see what amounts to
nightly ritualistic slaughters.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett summed up the tournament thusly: ``For us to lose a
game, Hurricane Hugo would have to come back.'' He's right.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament format itself is ludicrous; after four games,
only one team from each of the two groups is eliminated. And the
biggest games are the two semifinals; the winners of those games
get the two Olympic spots. You can imagine what the gold medal game
will be like with nothing on the line.
</P>
<P>
   The United States opened against Uruguay Thursday night, which
is, like everyone else here, simply hoping not to be too
embarrassed and maybe to get a shot at the qualifying games. This
was a first for Uruguay; it had not played against a US team of NBA
players in international competition. Its last Olympic meeting with
a United States team resulted in a 36-point loss in Los Angeles in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   This US team lacks the cachet and star power of the original
Dream Team (and its successors) but is still, by far, a collection
of rock idols by comparison. They came out for warmups some 40
minutes before the game began and the crowd buzz was unlike
anything before.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers must be happy they're here, although the Roberto
Clemente Coliseum has been more empty than full. Tourists at the
Westin Rio Mar Resort can tell their family and friends that they
shared poolside and tee times with some celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   But from a pure basketball standpoint, this is an exercise in
futility. The US team doesn't need to be here, shouldn't have to be
here, and maybe it's time the folks who decide these things figured
that out as well.

NEXT IN NEW AGE: FALUN GONG

 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In silence, the 50 men and women form themselves into orderly
rows on Boston Common. Then, in slow motion, they begin a series of
rhythmic, meditative exercises that dates to a self-improvement
technique rooted in the mythic pre-history of China. The technique,
called Falun Gong, is poised to become the next exercise and
consciousness-expanding craze of New Age America.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong (``Law Wheel'') is a form of Qi Gong, the
more-than-4,000-year-old Chinese exercise and meditation system
that purports to channel energy (or Qi, pronounced ``chee'') to
different parts of the body. It is the basis of tai chi and martial
arts such as tai kwon do. Also sometimes known as Falun Dafa
(``Great Law''), the technique includes elements of Buddhism,
Taoism, and Confucianism, philosophies that encourage simple and
harmonious lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Qi Gong is usually practiced by people who want to have a
healthier body,'' says Michael Tsang, one of the organizers of the
recent ``promulgation'' event on the Common, ``but Falun Gong is
also about cultivating your higher self, what in Western terms is
called personal growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong was founded in China in 1992 by a mysterious,
charismatic former martial arts instructor from Manchuria named Li
Hongzhi, who now lives in Manhattan. Although it claims 100 million
followers worldwide (more than two-thirds of them in China) Falun
Gong attracted little attention until this spring.
</P>
<P>
   On April 25, in response to the Chinese government's attempts to
restrict the movement, more than 10,000 practitioners converged on
the official residence compound in the heart of Beijing. They spent
the entire day in silence, meditating and doing Falun Gong
exercises. At sundown _ after picking up all their litter _ they
quietly dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That demonstration in Beijing was amazing because it was
totally unexpected,'' says Donald Klein, a Tufts professor emeritus
of Asian studies. ``That sort of thing isn't supposed to happen in
China. Nobody knows what it means.''
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong was confined to Boston's Chinese community when it
was introduced to Boston about three years ago. However, there are
now branches at Harvard, MIT, Boston University, and Tufts.
Lectures on the system and instruction in its techniques are given
frequently by volunteers like Tsang. ``All our lectures and classes
are free and we don't ask for donations; this is just something we
believe in,'' says Tsang, who credits Falun Gong with curing him of
a debilitating fatigue syndrome. ``I'm also kinder and more patient
and tolerant,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Tsang estimates that there are about 200 serious Falun Gong
practitioners in the Boston area _ those who, like himself, devote
two or three hours a day to exercises _ but says several thousand
people have attended classes or demonstrations. Today there are
reportedly Falun Gong groups in 21 states and 80 Web sites around
the world devoted to it.
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing demonstration was apparently organized on short
notice by Falun Gong practitioners in northeastern China who
communicated with one another by fax, cellular phone, and the
Internet. ``We must have a lot of practitioners in cyberspace,''
quips Tsang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever political ramifications Falun Gong may have in China,
it doesn't have any in the United States,'' says Merle Goldman,
professor of Chinese history at BU. ``But it's interesting that a
fundamentalist movement with a mass following is using high
technology. Some members must be very sophisticated. In Chinese
history, many movements that started out as religious have become
political and that's why the government is frightened.''
</P>
<P>
   While he has no apparent political agenda, the 48-year-old Li
holds peculiar views _ among other things, he thinks most of the
world's scientists are aliens from other planets _ and claims
superhuman powers for himself and his followers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the biography found on most Falun Gong Web sites,
the first indication that ``Master Li'' had special gifts came when
he was 8 years old and willed himself to be invisible during games
of hide and seek. He also claims to be able to insert a ``spiritual
wheel'' into the abdomens of Falun Gong practitioners that can so
energize them they may even levitate.
</P>
<P>
   In this pragmatic and both-feet-on-the-ground country, Falun
Gong's greatest impact is likely to be on the thriving
personal-growth and martial arts instruction industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falun Gong is coming on like a tidal wave; I've never seen
anything like it,'' says Eugene Gaudreau of Haverhill, director of
the Oriental Arts Institute of New England, president of the
National Qi Gong Association, and a professional tai chi and
martial arts instructor for more than 25 years. ``Of course, they
give free Falun Gong lessons and that's a pretty powerful marketing
device,'' notes Gaudreau dryly. ``You get something for nothing and
a claim that you're plugging into some source of universal energy.
No form of Qi Gong will hurt you, but people with a void in their
lives can be vulnerable'' to going overboard.
</P>
<P>
   It was a flier advertising free instruction that introduced him
to Falun Gong last summer, says 22-year-old Jason Pomerleau of
Augusta, Maine, who was a Tufts student at the time. ``I was
looking for something to help answer my questions and free up my
life,'' says Pomerleau, who founded the Tufts Falun Gong group.
``Now I'm graduated and have to find a job to pay off my student
loans,'' he says. ``I hope Falun Gong can help with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Pettinari of Groton says he responded to an ad in a local
paper offering free Falun Gong lessons. He now spends about 90
minutes a day going through the five prescribed Falun Gong
exercises. ``I have reached levels of tranquility I've never known
before,'' asserts Pettinari, who says he previously was a devotee
of Eckankar, a Minnesota-based New Age religion.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong has frequently been referred to as a cult in news
reports, but local practitioners insist that while it has spiritual
content, it is not a religious movement. ``I've never been
religious and this isn't a religion,'' declares Tianlun Jian, who
has a PhD in economics and works for a Boston securities firm.
</P>
<P>
   Although Li is its acknowledged leader, Falun Gong supposedly
has no formal structure. ``There is a certain amount of
organizational activity,'' concedes Tsang, ``but individuals
volunteer to do whatever has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The event on the Common appeared to be well-organized. Display
panels alongside the rows of practitioners explained their
movements and other panels detailed Falun Gong's philosophy in both
English and Chinese. Leaflets and copies of books about Falun Gong,
written by Li and awkwardly translated into English, sat on tables.
</P>
<P>
   However, none of the practitioners levitated. ``Some of them
might be able to do it,'' Tsang says, ``but levitating in public
would be showing off, and that's not Falun Gong.''

<P>
   Q. How can I clean flocked wallpaper?
</P>
<P>
   WORRIED OVER PAPER
</P>
<P>
   A. That's a good question, until now, because until now it was
impossible. I suppose you could wash it with detergent and water,
but that could ruin thehe flocking. And if you ever tried the
old-fashioned dough type paper cleaner, I can only have nightmares
over what it would do to the flocking.
</P>
<P>
   But as I said, until now. This is what you can try: There are
two new dry sponges on the market. One is the Gonzo Wonder Sponge
made by the Gonzo Corp. in Canton, Mass. The other is Soil &AMP; Soot
Remover, a dry sponge made by Block/New England in Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Both are sold in hardware and building supply stores, and both
are used dry. When the sponge gets dirty, wash it in detergent and
water, rinse and let dry.
</P>
<P>
   Still another is Dry Magic, a pad made to clean wallpaper. And,
if all else fails, you could soak a regular sponge in a a strong
solution of baking soda and water, squeeze it out as dry as
possible, and try that on the paper.
</P>
<P>
   As always, try these techniques on an obscure area of the paper
to make sure it doesn't adversely affect the paper. No guarantees.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Q. I had a butcher block cutting board made. It looks great. How
can I finish it so it will stand up to wear and tear and be safe
for handling food on? Would olive oil do? Mineral oil?
</P>
<P>
   CHARLES BENEDICT, Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Olive oil or any other vegetable oil is not ideal because it
can get rancid. Mineral oil is a fair choice because it has a low
toxicity. Boiled linseed oil is out because it has a considerable
amount of toxicity.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockler Woodworkers Store catalog sells two finishes it
claims are safe for surfaces that come in contact with food. One is
Butcher Block Oil that the catalog says meets all FDA requirements
for surfaces that contact food. The other is Salad Bowl Finish,
claimed to be safe for food contact 72 hours after applying. Call
800-279-4441.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My basement family room is circa 1959, with 9-inch by 9-inch
tiles on the floor, probably vinyl asbestos. I would like to cover
them with 12 x 12 self-stick tiles. Can I do that? The dark brown
paneling looks pretty awful, but is still intact. How can I lighten
it up?
</P>
<P>
   LYNNE VITI, Westwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, you can cover the vinyl-asbestos tiles with the
self-stick tiles. Avoid lining up seams. Get the old tile squeeky
clean first. Covered, the old tiles will be out of harm's way. In
fact, they may or may not contain enough asbestos to be a hazard.
Some tiles contain a small fraction of asbestos, and if it less
than 1 percent they are safe to remove and dispose of by you. But
covered, they are safe. They are safe as long as they are not
abraded, sanded, broken, sawn, punched, drilled or otherwise
disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   As for the paneling, whether it is plywood (real wood veneer),
solid wood, or the photographic paper-covered paneling, you can
paint it. First, sand it to reduce gloss and roughen the finish. If
it is paper, don't sand too heavily because if you do, you will
turn the paper into a fuzzy mess that is difficult to paint
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Wash with paint thinner or a strong solution of Spic and Span
and water. Again, if it is that paper stuff, don't get it too wet.
Let dry, and apply one coat of a latex enamel undercoater (also
called primer-sealer), and finish with two coats of any finish
paint you like.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The clapboards on the front of my old house were painted with
an oil primer and oil house paint. The painter caulked all the
clapboards. A year later they are peeling to the bare wood. The
sides and back of the house were treated with a primer and solid
stain, and look good after 10 years. How can I keep paint on the
front?
</P>
<P>
   B.S., Cohasset, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The peeling was caused by moisture, and caulking the
clapboards made things worse by trapping moisture behind the
clapboards. I suggest you remove the caulking; there may be enough
space between the clapboards to let that water vapor escape before
it pushes off more paint. To allow more water vapor to escape,
insert little plastic wedges (sold in hardware and building stores)
under the clapboards to open them up a bit more; the clapboards
will remain weathertight. Scrape and sand off loose paint; then
apply a coat of latex or oil exterior primer and finish with two
coats of a solid color stain. The primer and solid stain on the
sides and back of your house are a good indication that this
technique will work.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does a fir deck need protection? Do I have to sand before
putting on a protectant?
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT BROTHERS, Orleans, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, it does, probably more than any other decking material.
Forget about clear sealer; it is good for only a year or two when
you have to do it all over again. Use a semitransparent house
stain; no sanding is needed if the wood is clean. Ony one coat of
stain is needed, and will last for three to five years. When it
begins to wear off, give it another coat; jut one coat.

NO REASON TO KNOCK `WOOD' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Luther Vandross' 1985 slo-jam, ``If This World Were Mine,'' is
laid out in all its back-in-the-day glory in ``The Wood.'' The song
made a minor national dent at the time, but it's a Vandross staple
and the unofficial love theme of writer-director Rick Famuyiwa's
``Thriller''-era period piece that manages to apply a black
sensibility to the high-school high life that's been the domain of
white-male memories all year.
</P>
<P>
   Part after-school sex comedy, part wedding-blues slapstick, part
cornball friends-are-family moralization, ``The Wood'' exists as a
seldom represented American time capsule, and it's all good.
</P>
<P>
   Famuyiwa evokes an age of Members Only jackets worn by boys
debating which ``Purple Rain;; temptress they'd rather be with _
Apollonia or Vanity. The boys _ Mike, Roland and Slim (Sean Nelson,
Duane Finley and Trent Cameron) _ are insta-homies, looking like a
trio of New Edition castaways trying to get sex education in the
pre-hip-hop Inglewood neighborhood for which the film is named.
</P>
<P>
   But to get to the movie's schoolyard nostalgia, teen-age sexual
ripening and Eric B. 'n' Rakim and Mtume on the soundtrack, ``The
Wood'' has to hang with Mike, Roland and Slim as grown men, one of
whom is on the verge of a trite pre-matrimonial breakdown. Roland
(Taye Diggs) says he doesn't want to spend the rest of his life
wondering ``what if'' he married the wrong girl. (Shhh, but Ro's
bride is played by Lisaraye, the bloodthirsty stripper from Ice
Cube's ``Player's Club.'' He may have a point.)
</P>
<P>
   Roland's nervousness, which leads to his drunken stupor _ that's
how Mike (Omar Epps) and Slim (Richard T. Jones) find him _ is
nothing more than an excuse for Diggs to demonstrate that he's one
of the few legitimately charismatic guys waiting for a
breakthrough. But like the boys from ``American Pie,'' and the
young men from ``Cooley High'' and ``Diner,'' these are friends
whose fear of commitment is a mutation of their being afraid to be
without each other, as Roland confesses. Their familiar, fluffy
brotherly love gives way to the more original mid-'80s flashbacks
that really deserve a movie of their own.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Famuyiwa unleashes his flair for crafting engaging
situations from hysterical passages in his own adolescent memories.
A run-by booty-pinch is played as life-or-death bullfight; a high
school becomes an urban soap opera of scheming and scoping with
more bubbles and less froth than its colorless counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   And Nelson (``Fresh'') as the teen-age Mike is all charm and so
thankfully low key that he makes Epps' take on the adult character
look studied. Nelson's especially good in his scenes with
take-no-mess Malinda Williams as the fuming victim of that butt-tap
who sics her gangsta brother, Stacy, on him. Stacy bloodies his
nose, then blesses Mike's crush on his sister by telling him that
Vandross treasure will be their song. As played by De'Aundre Bonds,
he's ``The Wood's'' revelation: a throwaway stereotype given
``Godfather''-ly weight that's as juicy as his Jheri curl.

'50S-'60S WERE THE AUSTRALIAN DYNASTY DECADES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It didn't matter who was playing. Sedgman or
McGregor, Hoadie or Muscles, Cooper or Anderson, Fraser or Rocket,
Emmo or Fiery, Rochie or Newk. For nearly two decades, whenever
Australia's tennis team took to the courts (usually against the
bloody Yanks), the Aussies could take the Davis Cup to the bank.
Or, rather, leave it there, in the Melbourne vault where they
stashed it for safekeeping between defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the mid-'60s, it became a bit expectant,'' remembers John
Newcombe, who played on four Cup winners and is captaining
Australia in this weekend's quarterfinal with the United States at
Longwood Cricket Club in Brookline. ``Now, if we were to get
through to the final, it would be huge. Then it was, well, that's
what we're supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1950 and 1967, when Australia won the Cup a monopolistic
15 times, losing the Cup was like missing Christmas. In fact,
playing for the Cup was a Christmas tradition during the Challenge
Round era, when the champion needed only face the survivor from the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has changed,'' says Rod Laver, who played on four
straight Cup winners from 1959-62. ``We always waited for a
challenger. We weren't obligated to spend any time getting to
ties.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless they'd lost the Cup, which they did (by 3-2 scores to the
US) in 1954, 1958, and 1963, the Aussies were always holding court
in (their) high summer in Kooyong Stadium in Melbourne or White
City Stadium in Sydney or Memorial Drive in Adelaide against some
poor blokes (usually the Yanks) who'd come halfway around the world
by propeller plane.
</P>
<P>
   And whenever they lost the Cup, the Aussies went to Forest Hills
or Cleveland the next year and grabbed it back. Their
sneaker-footed dynasty survived everything but the Yankee dollar
that siphoned off the Oz varsity to the pro ranks in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   But during tennis's postwar ``shamateur'' days, when only
nonpros were eligible to knock about for Dwight Davis's ornate
punch bowl, Australia ruled with captain Harry Hopman's homegrown,
handpicked stable of thoroughbreds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were probably ahead of the rest of the world at the time,''
says Newcombe. ``We hadn't had war on our territory; we had tennis
courts all over the place. And the sport attracted our best
athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopman, the iron-handed sportswriter and former Cupper himself,
knew every one of them from Victoria to W.A. It was Hopman who
brought Australia back to glory after the US had hammered the
Aussies four straight times from 1946-49. It was Hopman who scouted
out the talent, kept the pipeline flowing, chose who got to compete
overseas, and picked the Cup team. ``We had selectors,'' Laver
says, ``but Hopman almost always told the selectors what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Aussies went to Forest Hills in 1950 and ripped the
Cup away from the Yanks with Frank Sedgman and Ken McGregor, nobody
was going to argue with Hopman or his methods. It didn't matter
whose names Hopman put into the draw _ Sedgman and McGregor,
teenagers Lew Hoad and Ken Rosewall, Ashley Cooper and Mal
Anderson, Neale Fraser and Rod Laver, Roy Emerson and Fred Stolle.
The dynasty kept rolling. ``Hopman was grooming players all the way
along,'' Laver says.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was as deep as the Aussies. Nobody was as fit. Nobody was
as hungry. Nobody was as competitively honed. ``The whole year was
just to set the wheel in motion to get your two singles players for
Davis Cup,'' Laver recalls. And nobody had more esprit de corps,
forged by years of traveling together thousands of miles away from
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you went overseas, you were away for seven months and you
never came home,'' Newcombe says. ``That was one of the reasons why
we had that team spirit, the all-for-one-and-one-for-all feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Prima donnas and attitude cases were kept home. It was an honor
to play for Australia, whenever the call might come. ``Nobody was
jumping up and down, saying, `My turn, I should play,' '' says
Laver, who waited three years for his Cup debut. ``The feeling was,
Australia's got to win the Davis Cup. So Australia had to come
above the individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Down Under, the Cup was sporting's Holy Grail. Matches were
televised and broadcast on radio, and the stands were jammed for
the Challenge Rounds against the Yanks. ``I remember when I was 10
years old in 1954, sitting in White City Stadium with my Dad and
dreaming about playing,'' says Newcombe.
</P>
<P>
   Hopman already knew about him. By 16, Newcombe was going
overseas. At 19, he found himself in the lineup for the 1963
matchup with the US in Adelaide. ``I was sort of the nobody thrown
in against Dennis Ralston and Chuck McKinley,'' Newcombe says.
``And even though I lost both my matches, I was a national hero
because I'd put up a good fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two men got to play Cup singles for Australia. If that was
a burden, it was also a privilege. ``You wanted it,'' says
Newcombe. ``There was pressure, but you were seeking it.''
</P>
<P>
   There was always someone stepping in when the top men turned
pro, always someone to keep the fire stoked, always a couple of
teenaged acolytes brought along as sparring partners so they could
learn what had kept the country Down Under on top. ``You hang
around champions, you start thinking like a champion,'' says
Newcombe.
</P>
<P>
   But when the dynasty ended, it ended abruptly, halted by the
advent of open tennis and lucrative professional options. ``Nobody
realized it then, but that was definitely what happened,'' says
Newcombe.
</P>
<P>
   The last hurrah came in 1967 at Brisbane, where Australia rubbed
out Spain for its fourth straight Cup. Soon after, Newcombe and
Roche signed as contract pros with World Championship Tennis and
Emerson joined Laver, Rosewall, and Stolle in the National Tennis
League.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks, on a ``quest'' with rising stars Arthur Ashe, Clark
Graebner, Stan Smith, and Bob Lutz, came to Adelaide a year later,
buried the Aussie second string, 4-1, and took the Cup home, where
it remained for five years. In 1969, Australia lost the opener to
Mexico and missed the final for the first time in 32 years. The
chain had been broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new guys had never traveled in a team with us, so they
never got the opportunity to learn what we'd learned,'' says
Newcombe. ``All of a sudden they were playing for Australia, and
they weren't ready.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was open tennis, the rise of the Association of Tennis
Professionals, and the abolition of the silly rule banning contract
pros from Cup play that eventually brought the Aussies back to
glory.
</P>
<P>
   With everyone eligible for 1973, the call went out to the
38-year-old Rosewall (who hadn't played for the Cup in 16 years),
the 38-year-old Anderson, the 35-year-old Laver, and the
27-year-old Newcombe. ``We were the Geritol squad,'' laughs Laver.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Antique Show'' ripped through everybody that year, and
Newcombe and Laver blanked the Yanks, 5-0, in Cleveland to bring
the punch bowl back home.
</P>
<P>
   The only man missing was Hopman, who had left for the States a
few years earlier to start his own tennis academy on Long Island _
and groom a future Cup titan named McEnroe.

WHEN THE PIE GETS DIVVIED UP, BAY STATE GETS A RAW DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On one hand, this is only an argument about 11 cents. On the
other hand, it's the story of how taxpayers in Massachusetts get
shortchanged about $4 billion a year by the Sun Belt commandos who
have captured Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Because if you pay taxes in the Commonwealth, for every dollar
you send to Washington, you get back the equivalent of 92 cents.
That was the number two years ago, the latest available. But the
number at the start of this decade was $1.03.
</P>
<P>
   So who clipped us for the 11 cents? The short answer is Uncle
Sam. The long answer is the congressional system of apportioning
federal largesse via the committee structure. But the really long
answer is the relentless drift of the political center of gravity
south and west, further from the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Northeast states tend to have higher incomes, pay
more in taxes, have higher housing and energy costs, grow less
food, and house fewer military installations, we don't get as much
back as we send to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at MassINC, the new nonpartisan think tank that
publishes the CommonWealth quarterly, and the Heinz Foundation,
commissioned an aptly named number-cruncher named Andrew Sum of the
Center for Labor Market Studies to examine the economic entrails.
``Massachusetts gets a raw deal,'' is one headline over the sum of
Sum's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Last time I checked, the mythical population center of the
United States was somewhere west of Kansas City and trending
southwestward. Eight of the top 10 Republicans in leadership
positions in the US House and Senate are Southerners or Westerners.
Of the serious candidates for president, most are from Southern,
Western or border states.
</P>
<P>
   What this means is that when that great big pie gets divvied up
in D.C., the guys with the tall hats, cowboy boots, and drawls get
more and more, and we get less and less. Senate majority leader
Trent Lott's Mississippi got back $1.59 in federal dough for every
buck sent.
</P>
<P>
   But one intriguing wrinkle uncovered by the MassINC study is
that the federal formulas used to distribute poverty-fighting money
discriminate against the Northeast. Why? Congressional formulas
don't factor in the high cost of living here, half of it
attributable to costly housing.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is no bulletin to recent arrivals in Beantown: It
costs between 14 and 17 percent more to live in Massachusetts
generally than in the rest of the United States, and if you move to
Boston or the immediate suburbs, it's upwards of 30 percent because
of the housing shortage and high rents.
</P>
<P>
   But Uncle Sam calculates simply that if you live in, say,
Mississippi, it costs you the same as if you live in Boston. No
way. The Bay State per capita income falls from 4th-highest to only
22d-highest among the states when these extra costs of housing (50
percent of the surcharge) and higher taxes (25 percent of the extra
hit) are figured in.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress would only adjust poverty grants to the states by
factoring in the higher rents charged in the Northeast, argues
MassINC's policy director, Mike Gritton, we would get a tremendous
jolt of new housing and education money that would help reduce the
shortfall between what we are taxed and what we get back.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 sweepstakes, New Mexico taxpayers got back $1.90 for
every buck they chipped in. Do you think that might have something
to do with the fact that Senator Pete Domenici runs the Senate
Budget Committee? West Virginia got back $1.62. Think Senator Bobby
Byrd, the former Senate leader, had anything to do with that?
Arkansas got $1.32. That's four bucks back for every three they
send in. Think having a president for two terms helped? While our
wedge of pie gets skinnier, every Southern and Rocky Mountain state
got a fatter slab. With the passing of the speakership of Tip
O'Neill and the glacial shift of clout to the Sun Belt, our elbow
room at the trough has been considerably diminished.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans hereabouts argue that if we didn't have an
all-Democratic congressional delegation, we might get a few more
crumbs from the federal Treasury. Of course, if the GOP managed to
elect more than one state legislator out of every five or six, they
might have more luck in running for federal office.
</P>
<P>
   Of more substance to Gritton and the number-crunchers are the
trends of the past decade: ``The substantive ones are defense cuts,
cuts in research and development money, and Medicare and Medicaid
cuts over the past six to eight years,'' which slammed Bay State
outfits like Raytheon, Mass. General, the medical schools, etc.
``All that worked to our detriment, not to our benefit.'' While we
got more than our share of transportation dough over the years for
the Big Dig, overall we are getting sliced-and-diced on the poverty
handouts because of our high housing and tax burdens. Yo, Trent: I
want my 11 cents back.

SAY GOODNIGHT, HENRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One wonders, idly, if WGBH operated in the Real World, whether
station boss Henry Becton would still be employed. In recent
memory, Becton has chalked up an impressive array of gaffes:
</P>
<P>
   _ He gutted the ``Ten O'Clock News,'' the only decent
non-commercial newscast in the city. 'GBH's local news
``commitment'' was transfered to ``The Group,'' a well-meaning
flop. Emily Rooney is gradually finding her footing on her
still-uneven public affairs show, ``Greater Boston.'' But let's
face it, she's no Chris Lydon. Say what you will about my effete
friend Chris, he's the Babe Ruth of Boston public broadcasting, and
Becton lost him to crosstown rival WBUR.
</P>
<P>
   _ 'GBH shut down Ron Della Chiesa's popular ``MusicAmerica''
radio show to take a flyer co-producing ``The World'' with the BBC.
The Anglo-phony allure is all but irresistible at 'GBH, e.g.,
``Masterpiece Theatre,'' but ``The World'' remains as goofy and
irrelevant as ever.
</P>
<P>
   _ Becton personally oversaw the debacle of the Margret Rey will.
Even though he was warned about the potential negative fallout that
might arise from contesting a dying woman's request to re-direct a
portion of her $8 million legacy to religious charities, Becton
battled Rey's legatees for her money. After the inevitable PR
Waterloo, 'GBH accepted a compromise solution that had been
available before the negative publicity.
</P>
<P>
   None of this really matters. As the nabobs of Boston's major
nonprofits _ Neil Rudenstine of Harvard, Malcolm Rogers of the
Museum of Fine Arts, Nick Zervas at the Boston Symphony Orchestra _
know, the small stuff doesn't count. Rudenstine abdicates the
traditional leadership role of the university president; Rogers
fires a couple of curators and tees off the Beacon Hill lockjaws;
the BSO gets into a tangle at Tanglewood. Nothing matters as long
as the money keeps rolling in.
</P>
<P>
   But now 'GBH has touched the third rail of public broadcasting.
By sharing its mailing lists with the Democratic Party, and then
dissembling the extent of the station's involvement, it has
jeopardized not only its own funding but the congressional
appropriation for public radio and television stations across the
country. It's hardly surprising to find 'GBH in bed with its
ideological soulmates in the Democratic Party. But to play footsie
with the Democrats when Republican Party chairmen hold the purse
strings for millions of dollars of badly needed subsidies _ that's
just plain stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time for new judgment at the top.
</P>

BU's Loss, BC's Gain
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, someone put the question to Boston University
president Jon Westling: BU houses many a prominent conservative
intellectual; Does it have any great thinkers on the left? Westling
demurred, and finally blurted out: ``Alan Wolfe!''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe, a renowned social scientist and author of ``One Nation
After All,'' is hardly a man of the left, but at BU these terms are
relative. And, as of two months ago, he's no longer at BU. With
some fanfare, Boston College persuaded him to change zip codes and
take charge of its newly created Center for Religion and American
Public Life.
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case at BU, there were ``circumstances''
surrounding his departure. Wolfe ran into trouble when he assumed
the chairmanship of BU's fractious sociology department. He clashed
not only with his predecessor, the wife of prominent conservative
Peter Berger, but also with the left-wing relics still haunting the
corridors. Says Wolfe of his adversaries: ``There's nothing more
conservative than a left-wing sociology department.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe managed to rally the department around a faculty
appointment that was important to him, only to see it shot down by
Westling, who deemed Wolfe's candidate to be unqualified. After the
turndown, Wolfe says, ``I felt my position was pretty
uncomfortable. I made enemies in the process.'' Wolfe asked to
resign his position in the sociology department (he also had a
political science appointment), and ``there was no effort to make
me stay.''
</P>
<P>
   So who does Westling have left, so to speak?

EXPLORING THE MYTH OF THE `ECOLOGICAL INDIAN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE ECOLOGICAL INDIAN 
Myth and History 
By Shepard Krech III 
Norton, 352 pp., $27.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hostile reaction of West Coast environmentalists to this
spring's whale hunt by members of the Makah tribe _ an event
memorialized by the televised harpooning and shooting of a gray
whale _ illustrates the conflict between the myth and the reality
of ``the ecological Indian.''
</P>
<P>
   Shephard Krech III, a professor of anthropology at Brown
University, says his carefully argued _ and thoroughly fascinating
_ study was meant ``to determine the extent to which Indians were
ecologists and conservationists (as is commonly understood
today).'' The evidence Krech marshals suggests that _ much like
present-day Americans, native or not _ they were ecologists when it
suited their needs and despoilers when it did not.
</P>
<P>
   One issue that concerns Krech is whether the Indians were so
exploited by European traders that they hunted animals such as deer
and beaver close to extinction in order to supply skins to trade
for European goods. The figures for the Southern trade in deerskins
are astounding: In the 1750s, some 175,000 skins were being
exported yearly from Charleston and 150,000 from Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   The ``conventional wisdom,'' Krech notes, is ``that Europeans
alone understood the true value of merchandise and pelts, and that
Indians, the `natural' residents, neither understood nor
profited.'' The problem with that, he writes, is that Indians
``leapt at the chance to exchange what was mundane and common (furs
and skins) for what was not (goods of new technological and
symbolic value).'' There are numerous accounts of Indians greeting
Europeans as they came ashore ``by waving pelts in their hands,
signaling unambiguously . . . their keenness to obtain the rare and
useful objects the Europeans possessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, as in their use of fire, the Indians were both
ecologists and despoilers. They burned ``often and for myriad
ends,'' Krech writes. Most often they set fires ``to improve
subsistence'' by clearing land for cultivation. Indeed, ``so
important was fire in the maintenance of grasslands that after
Indians died from disease or abandoned them, these clearings
quickly reverted to forest.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Indians also used fire to make it easier to travel
through forested areas and to assist in hunting of large animals.
One contemporary account cited by Krech reported that the Sioux
would encircle a herd of buffalo and then, after setting the grass
on fire to press the herd into the shrinking circle of fire, ``the
Indians, rushing in with their arrows and musketry, slaughter
immense numbers in a short period.''
</P>
<P>
   And also, ``as men and women of European descent soon
discovered, many Indians unhesitatingly used fire as an offensive
and defensive weapon,'' setting fires upwind of traders and
trappers to drive them into a waiting ambush.
</P>
<P>
   While it is not fully certain that the Indians understood ``the
ecological consequences of fire,'' what is clear to Krech is that
``by the time the Europeans arrived, North America was a
manipulated continent.'' It was not the seemingly virgin
wilderness, the ``Eden'' that so amazed early colonists, for ``the
Indians had long since altered the landscape by burning or clearing
woodland for farming and fuel.''
</P>
<P>
   So how, Krech asks, could America ``be simultaneously a paradise
seemingly untouched by human hands,'' yet inhabited by people who
had ``exploited lands and animals in order to live''?
</P>
<P>
   Krech suggests that this seeming Eden ``resulted both from
aboriginal demography and _ darkened by epidemic disease and death
_ from post-European epidemiology. In the first case, population
growth overstressed natural resources, prompting the region's
Indians to abandon the depleated territory and move elsewhere. In
the second, entire communities fell victim to smallpox and other
infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, Krech writes, ``were fully capable of
transformative action in ecosystems they knew intimately,'' but
their populations were too small and too widely dispersed ``to have
made much of a difference.'' And when they became even fewer as a
result of disease, ``the lands they had burned, cleared and
planted'' _ whether for agriculture, for hunting or for warfare _
``rested and recovered'' in relatively short order, in time to
appear as an Eden to early Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This paradise, this Eden,'' Krech writes, ``was mainly an
artifact of demography and epidemiology.'' And the actions of
Native Americans, whether they were ecologists or despoilers, may
not have been as important as the myth, which has flourished as
richly as the land itself.

HORROR FILM BLURS LINE BETWEEN DOCUMENTARY, MAKE-BELIEVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're looking for the telltale sign that ``The Blair Witch
Project'' is no-joke terrifying, you need look no further than the
shrieking kid trying with all his 2-year-old might to cover his
mother's mouth as she tells an amateur film crew about the myth of
the Blair Witch.
</P>
<P>
   His mother tries to dismiss the horror that breaks over her
son's face, but she's talking about the hirsute lady nymph who
snatches children and then kills them. You can tell that the boy
might wet himself if she doesn't shut up.
</P>
<P>
   That moment comes minutes into Daniel Myrick and Eduardo
Sanchez's unsettling sylvan nightmare about three filmmakers who
trek to the Maryland woods to shoot a documentary about the title
figure. It's a trip from which they never returned.
</P>
<P>
   The footage has been assembled from a camcorder and the stock
from a 16-mm camera into what we see as ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' and if you watch the film under the assumption that the
makers have ``disappeared,'' the effect of blurring the distinction
between documented terror and the kind you conjure is as
organically creepy as anything you've seen.
</P>
<P>
   The deceptive technical artifice basically boils down to the
film's three actors (Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams, Joshua
Leonard) making a film that turns out to be the very film you're
watching about the film they were making.
</P>
<P>
   They're brought together by Heather, a terribly poised,
twentysomething folklorist, whom you'd suspect of incredibly
romanticized (and ironic) notions about trading her life for her
art.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to make her into verite-girl and allowing her and
her partners Josh and Mike to film every minute of their trip is an
obvious gimmick. But we become disarmed as the trio hikes farther
away from ever getting out of the woods.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, all they have is their two cameras and the
increasing, tacit reliance upon an audience of witnesses to share
their horror as it's clear that something doesn't want them in its
forest.
</P>
<P>
   By the second night of camping, their tent is flanked by
cracking noises, and one morning three piles of rocks are left in
an equilateral triangle around their site.
</P>
<P>
   Staying lost another day means having to pitch a tent for
another night, a dreadful matter of fact that becomes more
frightening as their fear and revulsion of the woods has them
swapping common sense for insanity.
</P>
<P>
   Crucial to the film's eeriness is the use of natural sound.
</P>
<P>
   We're desperately listening inside that tent for those kiddie
yelps and the crescendo of broken branches and crushed leaves with
the same freaked-out paranoia as Heather, Josh and Mike.
</P>
<P>
   The forest has always been an anti-Walden dystopia for horror,
from the ``Deliverance'' rapists to goalie-masked summer-camp
psycho Jason. But ``Blair Witch'' forgoes a literal bogeyman in
favor of the unseen, which, in this case, is as scarily
bone-chilling as anything they could show you.

THE NAKED CITY, NEW YORK IS NOT: AT LEAST THIS JUDGE SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Naked bodies in the street don't exactly fit this
city's image just now.
</P>
<P>
   So when Spencer Tunic applied for a permit to photograph 75
people lying naked in a street in downtown Manhattan, it came as no
surprise when the city turned him down.
</P>
<P>
   But Tunic and his lawyer, Ron Kuby, made a clever move _ so
clever, it looks as though a federal judge is about to rule in
their favor.
</P>
<P>
   Before applying for the permit for the naked shoot, they asked
permission to shoot 75 clothed models at the same site, same time _
which, by the way, is 5:30 Sunday morning. The city assented.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the ``No way'' came back on the request to shoot the
models naked, Kuby appealed on free speech principles. ``This is a
content-based restriction,'' Kuby argued Thursday before federal
Judge Harold Baer Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Blocking traffic or disturbing the peace _ the city had no
problems on these grounds when the models were going to be clothed.
The only issue is that now they would be naked.
</P>
<P>
   New York State has laws against public exposure, but there is a
clause exempting art and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might think it strange,'' Kuby told the judge. ``I find it
strange. I said to myself, `There's got to be a law against this.'
'' But New York City never passed such a law. ``They could have,''
Kuby said, ``but they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Tunic has made a name in artistic circles for taking pictures of
naked people _ stark, haunting shots that contrast, as Kuby put it,
``the vulnerability of the human body and the anonymity of public
space.'' He photographed 28 naked people on the steps of the Boston
Public Library at dawn two years ago with no particular incident.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ who has taken great strides to shut
down porn shops and strip joints _ seems to see red when Tunic
takes out his camera in his town.
</P>
<P>
   New York City police have arrested Tunic or his models four
times. In all cases, the charges have been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The first time happened in 1995, when he photographed a nude
model on an 8-foot-tall Christmas ornament in Rockefeller Center.
The second took place in the stormy winter of 1996 when he shot a
naked woman lying on a snowbank under a sign that read ``Frozen
Fantasies.'' Last year, he was arrested in Central Park for taking
pictures without a permit.
</P>
<P>
   Most famously, in April, Tunic was handcuffed and dragged away
after getting 175 people to lie down naked in the middle of Times
Square at 6 one Sunday morning _ before he could manage to take the
picture (though photographers for the daily newspapers snapped
dozens of shots).
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a dozen police officers were waiting for Tunic at a
photo shoot and warned that they would arrest anyone who disrobed.
He called the gig off.
</P>
<P>
   Kuby said that unless the judge intervened in this case, Tunic's
shoot Sunday morning would be similarly preempted _ and, thus, his
First Amendment rights denied.
</P>
<P>
   The city's lawyer, Sherrill Kurland, argued that this was a case
of ``common sense,'' but Baer wasn't buying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he has a constitutional right, that may override that
objection,'' Baer said. ``That's what it's all about, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Kurland then switched tactics, only to end up in another corner.
The real issue, she said, was that Tunic wanted to shoot on a
``densely residential'' street. People _ children _ could randomly
look out their windows and see naked bodies. People object to this
sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you taken a poll?'' Baer asked.
</P>
<P>
   No, she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you talked at all about trying to find a more appropriate
location?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   No, she said, but added, ``We would entertain that discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Baer called the lawyers to his chambers. Kuby called the city's
bluff, offering to move the shoot to an emptier block.
</P>
<P>
   Kurland and her four associates went to make a phone call. They
were gone 15 minutes. When they came back, as Kuby described it
afterward, she said, ``We need more time'' _ till 10a.m. Friday _
to consider ``alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Alternative sites?'' Baer asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alternatives,'' Kurland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless I hear from you by noon,'' Baer said, ``I'll issue a
decision, probably one you will not like.''

MELODY MAKERS LISTEN TO THE `SPIRIT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers _ all children of the late
reggae king Bob Marley _ have toiled in their father's shadow for
years. They've been praised or criticized in reference to that
shadow, but on their new album, they step daringly into a new
light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really opened the door on this one,'' Ziggy says of the new
``Spirit of Music,'' a surprising, singer-songwriter-slanted disc
coproduced by Don Was, who has worked with the Rolling Stones and
Bonnie Raitt.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reggae textures, or the slickly produced, urban
crossover sound that the Melody Makers have tried in previous
outings, the new disc is a marvel of spare, acoustic-based tunes,
cut with a touch of the blues and with fresh philosophical insights
from Ziggy, now 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record is based on just me on the acoustic guitar, with
everything else complementing that,'' says Ziggy. Expect a lot of
these new, more meditative songs, as opposed to the party reggae
typically featured by the Melody Makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to let the physical side take a break right now. I want
to go to the spiritual side,'' says Ziggy. ``I want to head in that
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album, which was glowingly reviewed in Time this week,
was an outgrowth of a meeting with Was in Miami. Was listened to
Ziggy play new songs on acoustic guitar _ and suggested that should
be the approach to the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to keep the essence of the songs, so we added very
little in the studio,'' says Ziggy, who also broke away from the
band's familiar reggae studio musicians (``some of them were upset
with me'') to use players new to him, such as drummer Jim Keltner
(who has played with John Lennon and Roy Orbison) and bassist Hutch
Hutchinson, from Raitt's band.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome is magical on such tracks as the
country-blues-steeped ``Keep the Faith,'' the jazzy ``13 Months,''
and the pensive ``Many Waters,'' with Ziggy singing, ``Love is
stronger than death.'' His brother, Steven, adds two cover songs by
their father (including the rootsy reggae of ``You Got My Love All
Night Long''), but the main thrust is Ziggy's exploration of
quieter, more introspective, but no less compelling, sound
textures.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, there is not enough creativity (in the current reggae
scene),'' says Ziggy. ``We need to move to another level of the
music. That's what we tried to do.''
</P>

<P>
   Sevendust at Vans Warped: The Vans Warped tour is unlike any
other summer rock tour. In a democratic gesture, the bands flip
coins each morning to determine the order of the day's acts. Thus,
a different band usually ``closes'' the festival each day (the word
``headlines'' is not used on this tour). Ideally, that keeps both
bands and fans sharp, eliminating the complacency that can set in
at the more rigidly scheduled fests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it. This is my favorite tour of anything we've done,''
says Sevendust drummer Morgan Rose, whose group was on Ozzfest last
year. ``At Ozzfest, we played at the same time every day, but there
were a lot of empty seats. On this tour, the kids get there early
because they don't want to miss their favorite band. It's cool,
because we usually go on about 3 or 3:30 before the kids are too
beaten up by the other bands. Hey, it's non-stop carnage out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The tour is really diverse this year,'' says Rose. ``It's not
totally punk-driven like it used to be. The bands go from hard
rock, like us, to rock 'n' roll and hip-hop. There are more sides
of the spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based Sevendust will have a new album out in August
(``Home'') that was recorded at Longview Farm Studio in Carlisle,
Mass. ``It's a little bit darker than our last one, a little bit
heavier,'' says Rose. ``And we did more with electronics, but it's
still aggressive rock.''

EYES WIDE SHUT 
Directed by: Stanley Kubrick 
Screenplay by: Kubrick and Frederic Raphael, based on Arthur
Schnitzler's ``Traumnovelle'' 
Starring: Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack, Marie
Richardson, Todd Field, Julienne Davis, Thomas Gibson, Leelee
Sobieski, Vinessa Shaw, Rade Sherbedgia, Sky Dumont 
Running time: 159 minutes 
Rated: R (strong sexual content, nudity, language, and some
drug-related material) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would be gratifying to report that ``Eyes Wide Shut'' finds
the late Stanley Kubrick going out on top. But no. Although the
year's most eagerly anticipated film is ambitious as few films are,
it falls conspicuously short in realizing those ambitions.
Sometimes laughably short. It's a movie about sex made by _ and, I
suspect, for _ people who are afraid of sex. It at least answers
the question of why Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were cast, apart
from their box-office potential. They have what it takes to embody
an uptight and almost lethally naive married couple who allow their
dissatisfactions to nudge them into dangerous waters. In the case
of Cruise's upscale doc, this takes the form of sidling into an
orgy after his ego takes a buffeting. With Kidman's onscreen wife,
it takes the form of following her mind into a dream of illicit sex
hooked to a fleeting encounter and a degree of desire long absent
in her marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But because it is a movie about the least controllable of human
impulses made by the most controlling of directors, what should be
its tensions are stifled by its central contradiction. It's a too
obviously calculated and schematic chess game, too deadly earnest
to permit what could otherwise have been the humor in its moves to
save it from seeming stillborn. ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' especially in
what minimal degrees of taste forbid me from describing as its
climactic orgy scene, has the sexual energy of a dead battery.
There's a lot of smoke and mirrors in it, especially mirrors. The
scene of the doc fondling his nude wife, the one that has generated
so much hoopla via the film's trailers, is seen in a mirror in a
film that's launched on a series of nude images of Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   The film's chilliness is just right for the rich man's party
scene that follows, in which Kidman plays out a corny seduction
scene with a stock Hungarian lothario who seems a parody of the
Zoltan Karpathy stereotype of ``My Fair Lady,'' the one who, in the
peevish words of Professor Henry Higgins, oiled his way around the
floor. He never does have his way with her in the sculpture
gallery, although his attentions arouse her husband's ire. Her
displeasure, meanwhile, is ignited when she can't account for his
whereabouts after seeing him with a couple of models. In fact, he
has been hurriedly called upstairs by his host, Sydney Pollack's
evil ringmaster, to help out with a woman who has overdosed on
drugs after he had sex with her.
</P>
<P>
   Its big thematic link isn't between its stars and obsessive sex,
but between sex and death, especially death from a man's point of
view in which a woman is punished for sexual promiscuity. Time and
again, images of sex are shoved up against images of death,
including cadavers. Perhaps shaping the role to match Cruise's
narrow expressive range, Kubrick has written the doc as clenched
and intense, also dim, opaque, lacking in self-awareness, shaky in
self-esteem. After he's excited by an unconsummated advance made by
the daughter of a patient lying dead in the background, he slides
into the night and another interrupted sexual interlude with a
prostitute. A few chance encounters and a $74 cab ride into Long
Island later, he's at the orgy in cape and mask.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, he's in danger as it is realized he's not one of
the regulars. The real problem, though, is the orgy. It's not
mind-blowing, it's mind-numbing, heavy, deadly earnest. The
energies that fill the screen are leaden and studied, devoid of
anything suggesting real abandon. This is not a good thing in a
film based on a literary work by a Freudian womanizer arguing that
sex can be liberating. Once the film arrives at the orgy with
Cruise, it stops being Schnitzler and begins playing like Hogarth's
``The Rake's Progress,'' drops from a level of dreamlike
stylization to something more ordinary. Far from depicting lustful
uproar, it sinks into a panorama of jadedness, of people ashamed to
show their faces, trying to flog themselves into sexual arousal.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the doc returns home to discover that his wife may have
outdone him without having left her bed. Only when her character
speaks with a fierce sexual candor does Kidman come fully to life.
Otherwise, she seems either to be sleepwalking through her role or
embarrassingly brittle in her coyness. The only thing that keeps
``Eyes Wide Shut'' from seeming a dispiriting exchange of
Schnitzler's rueful world-weariness for the cautionary
antisexuality of the Age of AIDS is the hint, however
conventionally teasing, of ominous mystery in the aftermath of the
orgy. When the doc's detective work into the dire fates of a few of
the orgy's attendees attracts some threatening attentions, the
energy level momentarily quickens, only to yield to another cloud
of smoke when the doc finds himself again confronting Pollock's
slimy Mr. Big.
</P>
<P>
   It can at least be said that ``Eyes Wide Shut'' isn't boring,
even though Cruise never makes it to the dark side. And Kubrick's
sense of humor remains slyly intact. Also, his often opulent
visuals remind us that he was one of film's great stylists. He
flaunts the film's studio artifice in the Greenwich Village street
scenes. And he piquantly invites the speculation that the gated
estate where the orgy takes place, if not actually his own gated
English estate, evokes it in its seclusion and security
consciousness. But there's that word, security. That's what's wrong
here. There's too much of a feel of security consciousness in a
film that's supposed to be about the essential irreconcilability of
security and sex.
</P>
<P>
   Kidman's character comes closest to Schnitzler when she tells
her hubby to not use the word forever. When Cruise's character
narrows his eyes and tells us, with a would-be force of revelation,
that a dream is more than just a dream, he embodies what's wrong
with the film, namely its emptiness, its post-Freudian datedness,
its failure to regenerate the angst of fin de siecle Vienna in fin
de siecle Manhattan a century later. Bizarre as it sometimes is on
the surface, the problem with ``Eyes Wide Shut'' isn't that it's
wild, but that it's devitalized. In ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' Eros
doesn't stand a chance against Thanatos. If the Grim Reaper threw
an orgy, this is what it would play like.

   ``If I had my choice of the two places, the top is better. But,
for me, it doesn't change who I am,'' she says, speaking from a
tour bus earlier this week. ``It doesn't change my position in the
community. The people that I am friends with don't care too much
about that kind of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently that rollercoaster is at a peak _ what with the
phenomenal success of ``Believe'' (a single and CD), a tour, and
the acting accolades she's won for the recent film, ``Tea With
Mussolini,'' in which she plays a rich American singer living in
Italy on the verge of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Cher admits she's feeling the cool breeze of fame in her face
again, while viewing it with a certain detachment. Cher knows fame
is transitory _ ``We all have what's in front of us at the moment,
what is making the biggest noise'' _ but she knows she occupies
this unique niche in stardom's pyramid. ``It's not like the old
days when people went on forever,'' she says of stardom. ``I think
I'm old-fashioned in that way. I mean I have a foot in the past,
and a foot in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   And, sometimes, a foot in her mouth?
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of time,'' she laughs. ``I'm like the god, Shiva, only I
have feet instead of hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about that stuff,'' she adds, about her missteps
or mistakes and any ridicule they might engender. ``You put
everything out and sometimes those things that aren't really
successful, you're still happy doing them. If you are going to be
an artist _ yeah, it is really great to be successful _ but you
have to do the things that make you happy as well. A lot of times
they work and sometimes they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, too, is part of her appeal. Her blunt nature and
down-to-earth persona don't allow people to put her on a pedestal
too long. Women who speak with her immediately call her
``girlfriend.'' Her sexy, silly costumes allow for people to laugh
at her, but with her, too _ she knows what she is doing. She knows
how to handle David Letterman. And, if she misspeaks _ well, so be
it. If she releases a total kitsch bomb of a record called ``Allman
and Woman,'' with the then-love-of-her-life Gregg Allman, so be it.
If she fills career downtime with infomercials, well, OK. If she
chooses to date KISS's Gene Simmons, so be it. If she dates Bon
Jovi's Richie Sambora and her music moves toward arena-rock
bombast, oh, well, it's Cher. She's entertaining. She is a mixture
of confidence and insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' she says, ``I think that somehow those two
personalities live in equal force at the same time, and it is an
art of temperament.''
</P>
<P>
   Cher _ born Cherylin Sarkasian 52 years ago _ has had No. 1 pop
hits in each of the past four decades. For most of 1999 you've been
hearing her sing ``Believe'' _ ``Do you believe in life after
love?'' _ a hooky, defiant, beat-fest of a song she had to be
coerced into recording. Why so?
</P>
<P>
   Rob Dickens, executive producer of Warner Bros. UK at the time,
approached her and said, `` `How would you like to do a disco
album?' and just the idea of it being a disco album sounded so
weird to me,'' she recalled. Been there, done that. He sent her the
songs; she was turned around and even contributed lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   It became a hit, first with gay male audiences in Europe. Then,
it spread to the States and became ubiquitous on the pop radio
airwaves. It made her the oldest female pop artist to ever hit No.
1 on the Billboard singles chart, and propelled the album of the
same name to double-platinum status (signifying sales of 2 million
copies.) She lip-synched it at the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   On this tour, she has a six-piece band, backup singers, a
bells-and-whistles production. It will not be an evening of
subtlety and songcraft, but bombast and beats. ``It's not a show
with, like, just plain singing,'' Cher explains, perhaps
needlessly. ``It's very theatrical, like a rock 'n' roll circus.''
Opening is Cyndi Lauper, who's got a few Cher-isms in her work, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   So, it's a charmed life?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, sort of. Cher survived her cheeseball goofy-hippie '60s act
with then-husband Sonny Bono to carve out a unique career as an
actress, who makes smart choices about roles, and a singer who has
scored with hard rock, pop, disco, and schmaltz, who puts the top
in the phrase ``over the top,'' especially when she takes to the
concert stage. ``Someone has to draw the line for me where
over-the-top is concerned,'' she says, with a laugh, ``because then
and only then can you know when you are going over it. I just do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But she suffered with the death of Bono. She was calling him
``the best partner I ever had'' well before his ski accident last
years. Asked whether she wants to talk about him now, she parries,
``it depends on what you want to ask.'' She is asked about his
spirit, and if she somehow still feels his presence. ``Well, I just
do,'' she says, ``It is difficult to explain it, a closeness.'' She
is not pushed further. She did get nailed by Bono's widow, Mary,
for her televised eulogy, who accused Cher of pulling a star turn
for the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the people who criticized'' the eulogy, Cher says,
``I don't have any patience or time for that . . . It wasn't said
to please anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   She has suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome. ``I don't have
it right now, knock on any kind of wood,'' she says, ``but once you
have had it you become a little more susceptible to it. The thing
that really kills you is being on the road or just going from
project to project without any rest. I am going to rest after this
(tour) because I have been working a year and a half straight and
I'm pretty much at my limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Cher the canny architect of her career or a passenger on the
her express train?
</P>
<P>
   She pauses. ``I would say both . . . But I definitely feel
responsible. I don't know if architect is the right word, but I
feel the responsiblity is definitely mine.'' She will say she rates
herself higher as an actress than singer.
</P>
<P>
   Once the rest is over, she has two projects _ an album and a
film _ awaiting. She has already recorded the album, but postponed
the film because of the success of ``Believe.'' The album, ``Not
Commercial,''will only be available through her Web site,
www.cher.com.
</P>
<P>
   ````I wanted to put it out, but the record company (Warner
Bros.) said it was not commercial,'' she says. ``So, I called it
`Not Commercial.''' She depends largely on outside writers for her
big-time Cher albums. For this, she says, ``I wrote it more as
poetry, it's not the music I would usually sing. It comes from me,
so I feel totally comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, called ``Happy Jack,'' after a song by the Who, is
about a crazy Irish guy that comes to America. ``He's thinking that
if he can just get to Hollywood somehow, it will be a magic place
for him,'' Cher says. ``But he gets there and discovers old
Hollywood wasn't there anymore so he comes to grips with that. It's
funny and sad, just like life. I'm trying to fit it in in next year
because it's something I really want to do.''

IRON MAIDEN RETURNS TO BASICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce Dickinson, the once-and-again singer of British heavy
metal veterans Iron Maiden, scopes out the musical landscape and
licks his chops. The aggressive, attacking type of music his band
makes is the rage once again, getting played on active and modern
rock formats, albeit played mostly by younger bands. That's where
wily old Iron Maiden comes in. And, partially, why Dickinson, who
left the group in 1993, put his solo career on hold to rejoin his
mates in Maiden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going back with Maiden means there's a huge opportunity to do
several things,'' the singer explains, from a tour stop in Quebec.
``One, to revitalize this whole area of music that used to be metal
and is now fragmented all over the place, an opportunity to provide
a focus for what is becoming an upsurge of demand. There's genuine
on-the-street interest, but nobody seems to get it quite right in
terms or seizing the public imagination, and me re-joining Maiden
has seized everyone's imagination. We have a chance to be the No. 1
metal band on the planet. That's a great reason for rejoining the
band.''
</P>
<P>
   If he feels that way, why did he leave? ``Without seeming
churlish about it,'' Dickinson says, ``it was a nice routine to be
in, but it was nevertheless becoming a routine.'' (He was replaced
by Blaze Bayley; Maiden's fortunes faded.) ``I know a lot of people
think it's a routine they'd like to have, but to me, there was a
challenge missing. I went in and created my own challenge, by
starting again from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson calls his early solo years being ``out in the
wilderness in terms of big commericial success,'' but says, ``it
got to the point where it was going great in my solo career and
then the Maiden issue came up. (Rejoining) was not just as an easy
option.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson plans his own live album in September and a studio
album of unreleased material next year. But, right now, it's Iron
Maiden on all burners.
</P>
<P>
   The band's tour, which has sold out the Orpheum Sunday with
Monster Magnet, is the biggest in terms of production the band has
done in eight years: There will be pyrotechnics, video screens, the
full load. This, by the way, will take place in a theater that
lacks air-conditioning. ``I hate air-conditioning,'' Dickinson
says. ``I like to sweat. (When there is air-conditioning) I request
it be shut off at my show. I hate drafts. I like a nice, warm moist
environment in which to sing.''
</P>
<P>
   Iron Maiden is not touring behind what Dickinson calls a
``real'' record _ i.e., new _ but a 20-track, two-CD best-of called
``Ed Hunter,'' which features a bonus CD-ROM where the Maiden fans
get to pursue Eddie, the rotted corpse that has long been Maiden's
mascot, through seven levels, all of which correspond to an Iron
Maiden album sleeve. That is, they chase Eddie through a graveyard,
the south end of London, Egypt, and other places.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically an arcade shoot-'em-up game,'' says Dickinson.
``You get your gun, or in this case a mouse, and you go through
worlds and baddies come up and throw things at you. I've never
caught Eddie; I always get taken out by the zombies in the
graveyard. It's a great stress reliever, just don't take it too
seriously.'' In the wake of the Columbine High School schoolyard
shootings, it's become almost de rigueur to say that, which
Dickinson acknowledges, adding most kids are smart enough to
separate reality and fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kid who's going to be 9 loves the game and he tells me off
all the time, says I'm getting too serious. I have three kids and
we tried to get them to stop playing with guns, so they used sticks
or the end of the garden sprinkler in place of a gun. One day, they
were playing cops and robbers and I said, `You gotta watch it with
this gun stuff,' and one of them looked at me, and said, `Jeez, dad
it's a plastic sprinkler and I'm pretending it's a gun. It's a
game, dad.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Co-founding guitarist Adrian Smith (who left in 1988) also
rejoined Maiden, giving them a total of three axmen, co-founder
Dave Murray and Smith's replacement Janick Gers being the others.
Dickinson said it was never a question of giving Gers the boot, so
they just made room. How do they work out rhythm and lead roles?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' says Dickinson. ``They figure it out
themselves. . . . They lock themselves in a room for a day and a
half and come out say `OK, we got it figured.' They tag-team it.
They are the most mellow people for lead guitarists.''
</P>
<P>
   After this tour concludes in Greece in early October, Iron
Maiden begins to assemble the pieces for a new album. ``We've
written a good chunk of it,'' says Dickinson, ``but we're not gonna
start recording until November and hope to have the record out by
late spring.''
</P>
<P>
   What direction will the boys be headed in, musically? ``It's
kind of a no-brainer for us,'' Dickinson says with a laugh. ``It's
gonna be heavy. We're not gonna do a politically correct Iron
Maiden record. One thing the band has never done has been to
compromise its integrity, ever, making it almost unique. (Our
label) Sony is convinced there is a real place for Maiden, that we
can get on radio with what we do. If Maiden gets a sniff of getting
a record on radio, it'll go stratospheric. We're all only getting
started.'' If that happens, Dickinson promises, ``the mother and
father of all Maiden tours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a mission now, a cause,'' he adds. ``The metal
thing, which is important, but more being the band you're in. When
I go on stage and grab the audience, what makes me push myself to
work harder, to yell and scream, it's not the thought that I'm
bringing metal back, it's pure self-gratification.''

`WOOD' A COMEDY THAT LIGHTS THE FIRE OF FRIENDSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VANESSA E. JONES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE WOOD 
Directed and written by: Rick Famuyiwa 
Starring: Omar Epps, Taye Diggs, Richard T. Jones, Sean Nelson,
Trent J. Cameron  and Duane Finley. 
Running time: 106 minutes 
Rating: R 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not often that moviegoers get to see films about
African-American life that go beyond the hood or hip-hop comedies.
The last one was Maya Angelou's ``Down in the Delta,'' released
earlier this year. But its box office failure, along with that of
``Beloved'' and ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love'' in the last year,
reportedly has made Hollywood decision makers less inclined to fund
challenging black dramas or love stories.
</P>
<P>
   So when an African-American romantic comedy like ``The Wood''
comes along, one is tempted to light a candle to give it some good
karma. Unfortunately, that candle probably should be saved for a
more worthy candidate.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, ``The Wood'' is a pleasant film blessed
with charismatic performances by a talented group of young black
actors who cannily evoke their complex characters. However, the
screenplay, by Rick Famuyiwa (a 26-year-old newcomer who segued
from Niketown employee to film director), is plagued by too many
unoriginal comedic situations.
</P>
<P>
   The film is essentially a coming-of-age story about three young
men growing up in the ``Wood'' _ the predominantly black
middle-class neighborhood of Inglewood, Calif. We meet the guys as
adulthood bears down on them. Former ladies' man Roland, played by
yummy-looking Taye Diggs (Angela Bassett's boy toy in ``How Stella
Got Her Groove Back''), has disappeared two hours before he's to
say his wedding vows.
</P>
<P>
   Friends Mike (Omar Epps) and Slim (Richard T. Jones) track the
drunken groom down and dry him out. As they do, flashbacks, cued by
classic 1980s songs from Eric B &AMP; Rakim, Luther Vandross, and Run
DMC, explore the roots of their friendship.
</P>
<P>
   The story was inspired by Fumuyiwa's real-life experience. ``A
couple of years ago a buddy told me he was getting married and we
immediately started talking about our childhood,'' says the
writer/director. ``Two hours later we were still talking. You can't
help but look back when you reach milestones in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Three younger actors play Roland, Mike and Slim in their teenage
years and look nothing like their adult counterparts. They jauntily
sport shell toed Addidas and one even wears the most humiliating
hair trend of the '80s: Jheri curls.
</P>
<P>
   It's in these segments that the film disappoints. Young Mike
(Sean Nelson) gets excited looking at the cutest girl in class,
Alicia (Malinda Williams), who is asked to speak in front of the
class. Mike, Slim, and Roland bet on who will loose their virginity
first. Mike must learn how to dance so he won't embarrass himself
at a school party.
</P>
<P>
   These scenes have been reenacted ad nauseum in television
sitcoms and films. The difference is, of course, that viewers
rarely get to see African-Americans act out these moments of life
on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   Other scenes work well, such as when Stacey, Alicia's
gangbanging brother, offers the trio a ride after he has robbed a
local convenience store. The boys haltingly accept and the group
gets stopped by the police. But it's not teenagers Mike, Slim or
Roland who break down, it's Stacey's gangsta friend, who quietly
bawls in the front seat.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is held together by Epps, Diggs, and Jones. They have
an easy cameraderie that makes their long-term friendship
believable. Nelson (who debuted in the indie film ``Fresh'' several
years ago) and Williams stand out in the young cast _ their
tumultuous relationship becomes the heart of the flashbacks and
ultimately the film.
</P>
<P>
   But the person who may get a career boost out of ``The Wood'' is
Luther Vandross. The singer's stellar 1980s classic, ``If This
World Were Mine,'' gets played at least three times on the
soundtrack.

 &HT;    Cool cheeese
 &HT;    By Skippy Harwood
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cool, crisp salads are a welcome part of summer, and flavorful
cheeses such as feta, made in this country in Wisconsin usually
from cow's milk and in Greece usually from sheep's milk add an
agreeable tang.
</P>
<P>
   Tortillas provide a Spanish note and the option of a wrapped
salad, which becomes even more interesting when hummus is used as a
spread for the tortilla.
</P>
<P>
   Like feta, hummus is a distinctive food with origins in the
Mediterranean. A thick puree made with mashed chick peas (garbanzo
beans), lemons, spices and olive oil, it can be used as a dip or a
spread. Almost every Middle East family has own version.
</P>
<P>
   For a wrapped Greek salad, spread hummus on tortillas and top
with crumbles of feta cheese, shredded lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber,
onions and olives.
</P>
<P>
   Hummus is available commercially in flavors such as roasted red
pepper, roasted garlic, pesto, scallion, black olive, cucumber,
dill, spicy threepepper and more.
</P>
<P>
   A stimulating main course salad of feta tossed with marinated
grilled mushrooms, fresh spinach, tomato and red onion slices can
be a colorful centerpiece for an alfresco evening meal.
</P>
<P>
   Bowtie pasta tossed with feta, sundried tomatoes, cilantro,
kalamata olives, garlic and red pepper flakes makes a savory entree
that can be served warm or cold.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Loomis writes fondly of a goat cheese in red wine dessert
in her French Farmhouse Cookbook, published by Workman. That recipe
is very specific to Provencewhere the goat cheese has a special
tang that comes from the wild herbs that provide forage for the
goats on the rocky hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   The goat cheese in red wine was prepared for Loomis at the Les
Ramparts restaurant in Venasque, France, by chef Pascale Engasser
who explained that everyone in his village makes it with slight
variations.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, Loomis explains, each farm had its grape vines,
its goats and beehives to contribute to the dessert
</P>
<P>
   GOAT CHEESE IN RED WINE
</P>
<P>
   1 bottle hearty red wine such as Cotes du Rhone
</P>
<P>
   or Cotes du Ventoux
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons mild honey,

   3 fresh, plain, soft goat
</P>
<P>
   cheeses, each 6 to 8 ounces

</P>
<P>
   for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Candied lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   for garnish (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Heat the wine in a medium-size heavy saucepan over mediumhigh
heat until it boils. Then reduce the heat and simmer just until it
has reduced slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the
heat.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully flame the wine, to remove any excess alcohol, by
passing a long match over its surface. The flames will flare and
then die down almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Add the sugar and the honey, and stir with a wooden spoon until
dissolved. (You may make the recipe up to this point several days
in advance and refrigerate it.)
</P>
<P>
   Cut the goat cheeses in half horizontally, and place one half in
each of 6 shallow bowls. Return the wine mixture to a boil, remove
it from the heat, and carefully ladle the wine around the cheeses.
Serve immediately garnished with the mint and lemon zest, if
desired.

   APOLLO-MAIN _ CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Thirty years after men
first left Earth to walk on the moon, most of the surviving
moonwalkers gathered here to remember the event. Apollo 11
astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin are among at least seven
Apollo astronauts who were scheduled to appear at a 5:30 p.m. press
conference on Friday. They were also scheduled to speak at an
evening dinner, which will include many of the people who worked on
the Apollo program. But there was a twinge of sadness to the
occasion: one of their members, Apollo 12 astronaut Pete Conrad,
died last week when he crashed his motorcycle. Now only nine of the
12 men who walked on the moon are still alive. (Gaffney, Dayton
Daily News). 30.

   WEISS _ BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Mel Weiss, one of America's premier
lawyers in class-action litigation, will speak in Boca today about
the settlement proposal for Holocaust survivors. For more than
three decades, Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &AMP; Lerach has represented
plaintiffs in some of the biggest and most complex cases in the
history of United States antitrust, consumer, insurance,
environmental and securities fraud class actions. Some are quite
well-known: the Exxon Valdez oil-spill case, which resulted in a
$5.3 billion verdict; the Prudential Insurance deceptive sales
practices case, in which policyholders stand to get back $2
billion; and the Lincoln Savings &AMP; Loan scandal, where Weiss sued
and recovered $240 million lost by stock investors. Weiss now
representing Holocaust survivors in their $20 billion claims
against three Swiss banks accused of storing fortunes plundered by
the Nazis during World War II. His class-action suit led to the
creation of the compensation fund. (Sorentrue/Mack, Palm Beach

   BARAK-PALESTINE - HEBRON - U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak would find a good reality check
for their peace talks in the Street of the Martyrs in Hebron. Here,
the United States literally tried to pave the way to peace and
failed. The 400 meter stretch of road was beautified with $2.5
million in American aid money, but the Israelis, who control this
area of the city, don't allow Palestinians to drive there. The
fortified road blocks on the street divide the city, drag the local
Palestinian merchants into bankruptcy and make them distrust
American intentions, as well as the peace process itself. ``I don't
trust the American administration. They do things just for the
Israelis,'' says shop keeper Monther Shahin. ``This street is a big
example.'' It's not the only example. Throughout the West Bank,
Palestinians are getting impatient waiting for items _ land, roads
and economic perks _ listed in old agreements. (Kaplow, Cox News

NOT MANY KOSOVAR REFUGEES IN SEATTLE PLANNING TO RETURN HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN IWASAKI  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERCER ISLAND, Wash. _ If Sabahudin Muharremi doesn't seem eager
to accept an offer by the U.S. government of a free flight home to
Kosovo, there's a sorrowful reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``His home is destroyed,'' said Besim Krasniqi, his friend and
fellow refugee. ``He doesn't have a home to go back to.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a typical response by uprooted Kosovars, officials of
several Seattle resettlement agencies said this week as they helped
explain the government offer to refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department announced this week that the United States
will give free trips home on commercial and charter flights to
refugees evacuated during the Kosovo conflict. Nearly 10,000
refugees have been brought into the country over the past few
months, with about 80 resettled in the Seattle area by four
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Even as refugees here consider whether to head home to Kosovo,
where U.N. peacekeepers from different nations are stationed, other
Kosovars still are arriving because of the upheaval in their
homeland. At least four more refugees were expected Wednesday night
(July 14) from Macedonia, with five scheduled to come next week.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees do not have to return home and can stay permanently
here. They would be eligible for a ``green card,'' signifying
permanent residency, after one year and could apply for citizenship
after five years.
</P>
<P>
   Those who wish to fly home on the government's dime must do so
by May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Gjoni, a translator for the International Rescue Committee
in Seattle, has not talked to many refugees who are planning to
return home soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general response is no,'' Gjoni said. ``Houses are burned.
They don't want to go back, at least for now, because they don't
feel safe. Even though NATO forces are there, they think they'll
always be under the Serbian regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they say is, they want to go back for a visit someday,
but not right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Koser, director of the resettlement office for Catholic
Community Services in Seattle, said refugees have a variety of
reasons for hesitating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are in mixed (Albanian-Serbian) marriages. Some have run
from the KLA (Kosovo Liberation Army) and have refused to
participate in any war and may be shunned,'' Koser said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some refugees are separated from immediate
family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no easy putting-it-back-together process yet'' for
families separated by the war, said Bob Johnson, director of the
International Rescue Committee in Seattle. In some cases, refugees
may have more incentive to stay if they can bring missing family
members to America, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Many refugees, including the 40 or so Kosovars who are allowed
to live rent-free for 90 days at the Shorewood Apartments on Mercer
Island, have spent the past month learning English and taking
classes on work skills and job searches.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 27 refugees assisted by the International Rescue
Committee, three women are working as hotel maids and some men have
applied for jobs as supermarket baggers or office janitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to try to find employment for them rather than
find welfare,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees helped by his agency include Muharremi, 22, and
Krasniqi, 24, who were studying economics and law, respectively, at
the University of Kosovo in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Florent Istogu, 23, another law student in Kosovo, speaks fluent
English and is helping Johnson with translation work. Istogu came
to the United States with his girlfriend and did not know the fate
of their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``For three months, we didn't know anything about them,'' he
said. ``If they were not killed by Serbian forces, they would have
died from hunger. But I hear now they are fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Istogu longs to return to his university studies, ``but it's
better to stay here for one year or two years to earn money, to
send money home,'' he said. ``But if there's any chance, I'd like
to go to (a Washington) university also.''
</P>
<P>
   Gazmend Bytyqi, who worked as a mechanic in Kosovo, also will
delay his trip home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go back,'' he said, as Istogu translated. But first,
Bytyqi said he wants to work and save money to build a new home for
his parents, sister and brother, who are living in a tent in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   With Bytyqi, 31, are his wife, Blerta, and their 2-year-old
daughter, Arlinda.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his wife wanted to go home soon, Bytyqi replied,
``She says, `We came together and we want to go back together.'''

PREDICTABLE `LAKE PLACID' TOO DEEP FOR REAL CHILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
LAKE PLACID 
Directed by: Steve Miner 
Screenplay by: David E. Kelley 
Starring: Bridget Fonda, Bill Pullman, Brendan Gleeson, Oliver
Platt, Betty White 
Rated: R (violent creature attacks and related gore, and for
language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No summer allotment of scare movies would be complete without
the usual ``Jaws'' and ``Jurassic Park'' wannabes. On July 30,
we'll see ``Deep Blue Sea,'' with smart sharks as the gimmick.
Today, we've got a film whose cement-handedness begins with the
intended irony in its title, ``Lake Placid.'' Not to be confused
with the real Lake Placid, N.Y., it's named for a fictional lake in
Maine, where a boatload of squabbling investigators figures out
that the thing that's been biting the heads off various unlucky
fools who insist on immersing themselves in its depths is a
30-foot-long crocodile that has somehow migrated there from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Bloodthirsty though it may be, it genuflects to the Hollywood
convention of never scarfing down anyone from the A list, although
stars Bridget Fonda, Bill Pullman, Oliver Platt, and Brendan
Gleeson predictably take turns dodging the croc's gnashing teeth.
Creature designer Stan Winston gets star billing, too, which is
only fair. There are moments when the big croc seems almost alive,
or at least not much less so than the characters. They face far
more danger from the snapping jaws of cliches than the lively
mandibles of the bad-news reptile willing to settle for cows and
bears when no human is available.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers assure us that no cow was injured in the making
of the film, which is more than they can say for dramatic
credibility. ``Lake Placid'' wastes no time settling into
stereotyped setups. Paleontologist Fonda, blue over being dumped by
her boss for a co-worker and called upon to identify a large tooth
that turns out to be not prehistoric, figures it's time she got
away from the museum for a while, even though she hates the
outdoors. Fish and game warden Pullman is the guy she's obviously
going to wind up with, while Gleeson's thin-skinned blue-collar
sheriff and Platt's rich, eccentric prof who flies his own
helicopter are obviously destined to embark upon ongoing class
warfare as comic antagonists. Betty White, as a secret-keeping
widow living on the shore of the lake, gets the best the script has
to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Lake Placid'' can get only so much mileage out of its
sole plot device, namely
there's-something-down-there-and-it-wants-you-for-lunch _ and skip
the fava beans and a nice Chianti. The actors mostly emerge
unscathed, in both senses of the word. Pullman keeps a low profile,
and Fonda generates appeal despite the patronizing view of her
character. Platt survives being assigned more dumb lines than the
others. And Gleeson smoothly makes the jump from Ireland to
Hollywood, even incorporating into his alert performance a few
mannerisms from ``The General.'' The lake isn't bad, either,
looking lush and capable of harboring more than a few subsurface
secrets. But it's hard not to think of ``Lake Placid'' as ``Lame
Placid.''

HANFORD SETS UP BERYLLIUM SCREENING FOR WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Thousands of Hanford workers who may have been exposed
to beryllium, an element used in nuclear weapons production, could
be compensated by the U.S. government for illness related to their
exposure under legislation proposed Thursday by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Eastern Washington has
already set up a beryllium screening program for current and former
workers, said Mike Talbot, Hanford spokesman. So far, 196 former
workers have volunteered for the screening, and 16 current workers
are being tested for potential exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Between 4,000 and 13,000 former production workers and as many
as 36,000 former construction workers may have been exposed to
beryllium over the course of Hanford's operating history, said Dr.
Tim Takaro, co-principal investigator with the University of
Washington's Hanford Former Worker Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the operations and the secrecy means many people
may have been inadvertently exposed,'' Takaro said. No complete
lists of former workers exists, so the program is relying on
outreach and partial lists of workers to identify those potentially
at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Of those tested so far, four current workers have shown
beryllium sensitization, an immune condition that puts them at
higher risk for developing chronic beryllium disease, Takaro said.
One current worker has developed chronic beryllium disease.
</P>
<P>
   The compensation plan, which must still be approved by Congress,
marks the first time the government has acknowledged that its
nuclear weapons production programs during the Cold War may have
made thousands of workers sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. government is acknowledging that we made a mistake,''
said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson in announcing the
compensation plan. ``We need to right this wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Beryllium is a hard, grayish metal found in mineral rocks, coal,
soil and volcanic dust. Because of its unusual properties, which
include high thermal conductivity and resistance to corrosion,
beryllium compounds are mined and purified for use in various
industrial products, including nuclear weapons. Beryllium is also
used in spark-proof tools.
</P>
<P>
   Exposure to beryllium dust or fumes over time can result in
chronic beryllium disease, an inflammatory lung condition that is
potentially disabling and sometimes fatal, Talbot said. The disease
is highly variable, sometimes developing over a period of months.
In other cases, it can take up to 30 years for symptoms to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of the disease include coughing and shortness of
breath, abnormal scarring in the lungs, and abnormal lung sounds
heard with a stethoscope.
</P>
<P>
   Beryllium was used at Hanford from about 1960 until 1986,
primarily in the production of reactor fuel rods. Although there
are no active beryllium operations under way currently at Hanford,
there may still be beryllium present at some locations, Talbot
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to employees in January 1998, the company stated:
``Based on available personal/area monitoring data, it is believed
that nearly all employee exposure to beryllium was below the
permissible exposure level.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the letter continues, ``For very sensitive individuals,
it appears that they may develop beryllium disease even though
beryllium levels are within permissible limits.''
</P>
<P>
   About 5 percent of people who work around beryllium develop
sensitivity to the metal, and about 2 percent eventually develop
the disease, Takaro said. People who work around higher
concentrations, such as machinists, are at higher risk.
</P>
<P>
   Hanford is in the process of identifying all the locations where
beryllium was used in the past, and where it may still be present.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's proposed plan initially limits compensation
to workers whose illness can be traced to their exposure to
beryllium. Most of the workers were at sites in Colorado, Illinois,
New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of such compensation is estimated at about $13 million
a year for 10 years. Under the plan, eligible workers could be
reimbursed for medical costs, compensated for lost wages, and given
vocational assistance. As an option, they could take a $100,000
lump-sum benefit payment. If the worker has died, survivors'
benefits would be provided.
</P>
<P>
   Workers and their advocates are trying to expand the plan to
cover illnesses from other toxic and radioactive materials used at
weapons plants.
</P>
<P>
   The UW Hanford Former Worker Program is also looking at exposure
to noise and asbestos, Tadaro said.
</P>

FROM COLORADO SHOOTING GROWS A FRIENDSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After suffering numerous gunshot wounds at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., including a shotgun
blast to the face, Lance Kirklin came as close as one can come to
dying.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's living the high life in San Francisco for a week with
his new friend Rashad Williams, who collected pledges for running
The Examiner Bay to Breakers race, so far raising $40,000 to help
pay Lance's medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   Lance not only looks great after extensive facial reconstructive
surgery, (``Only five plastic surgeries to go,'' he said
matter-of-factly), but he wants to do everything there is to do in
San Francisco. And he's out-wisecracking our mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Lance, 16, and Rashad, 15, were in the City Hall rotunda, facing
dozens of television cameras, when Mayor Willie Brown presented
Lance with a San Francisco street sign saying ``Lance Kirklin
Blvd.''
</P>
<P>
   Lance leaned toward the microphone and said, ``Mr. Mayor, do you
have your own boulevard?''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, I told Lance that the mayor would love to have a
boulevard of his own. He said, ``Yeah, I know.''
</P>
<P>
   As Rashad said of Lance, ``He's funny all the time. He's a
wonderful friend to have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids in Littleton are very depressed and a lot are
scared,'' said Lance's dad, Mike Kirklin, who accompanied his son.
``But Lance is such a good example. He gets up in the morning and
he's ready to go. And he's getting back to his knucklehead self.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspiration comes in interesting forms, and here's a big
restorative dose, in the form of two teen-agers and their families,
who have become part of one big ``extended family,'' as Rashad's
mother, Sheila Burton Harrison, put it.
</P>
<P>
   Lance's father said he hopes Rashad's family can visit them
again in Denver, as they did in June, ``keeping this relationship
extended for a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Kirklin, who lost his other teen-age son, Nolan, to
suicide five months before Lance was shot, had tears in his eyes as
he told the crowd about his new bond with Rashad's family.
</P>
<P>
   Some city workers and tourists in City Hall had tears in their
eyes, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fantastic,'' said George Awad of Lake Placid, N.Y., who
was recording the scene on his home video camera behind the TV
photographers. ``It's very inspiring to see the city of San
Francisco celebrating these kids, making them feel important, not
only to the town but to the whole country.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, and if we must have media circuses, it was nice to see one
about something positive for a change.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters crushed Lance and Rashad as they stood on the
stairs of City Hall, but they spoke quietly and seriously into
every mike shoved in their faces, talking about people's amazingly
generous response to Rashad's fund-raising run.
</P>
<P>
   Lance and Rashad really are going to do everything arranged for
them, and more. They have boundless energy. They're kids. And they
really do like each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about movies, fishing, sports, all the things kids
talk about,'' Rashad said.
</P>
<P>
   They were a little late to the media circus because they'd slept
in at the luxury suites the Nikko Hotel managed to find for both
their families at the height of tourist season. Then the two young
guys got up and watched the Mel Gibson movie ``Payback'' together.
</P>
<P>
   They deserve a break, even from being celebrated. After all,
we're celebrating them because they're two kids who gave us a break
from despair.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind talk of despair this week, though. Rashad will throw
out the ceremonial first pitch to Lance at Sunday afternoon's
Oakland A's/Colorado Rockies game.
</P>
<P>
   Stand up and give our kids a cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Lance's hospital bills amount to nearly $1 million and he has no
health insurance. For those who want to help, checks may be made
out to the ``Lance Kirklin Fund'' c/o Everen Securities, 8005 S.
Chester St., Suite 300, Englewood, CO 80112.

CHEVRON TO TAP GASOLINE FROM OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California regulators have granted an
extraordinary request by the Chevron Corp., allowing the company to
sell gasoline that does not conform to the state's stringent
clean-air standards.
</P>
<P>
   An explosion Saturday at the Chevron refinery in Richmond
severely limited production, and Chevron took its request for a
variance from state law to the state Air Resources Board. The
accident was barely perceptible outside the gates of the complex.
</P>
<P>
   The state said sales of gasoline that does not conform to
California standards would be limited to Northern California and
the Central Valley. The exemption took effect Friday and will last
45 days.
</P>
<P>
   Sales are prohibited in Sacramento or Southern California, areas
that have the most severe smog problems.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron may sell up to 3.5 million barrels of gasoline obtained
from nearby states that is not as clean-burning as that required in
California. But the exemption comes at a price. The state is
charging San Francisco-based Chevron 15 cents for each gallon of
non-conforming gas _ a fee that could reach $22 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gas sold in California cuts hydrocarbon emissions by about 17
percent. The gas of other states cuts emissions by about 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The variance was granted to avoid a supply disruption caused
by unforeseeable problems at Chevron's Richmond refinery,'' said
Jerry Martin, a spokesman for the Air Resources Board in
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first variance the Air Resources Board has granted
for gasoline under terms of the 1996 Clean Air Act, which required
oil companies to sell only reformulated gas. Similar action was
taken in 1993 and 1994 to relieve a shortage of diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Lee, spokeswoman for the Bay Area Air Quality Management
District, said district officials were disappointed with the
decision, particularly coming during the high smog season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will add 9 tons a day of hydrocarbons, a real chunk of
pollution,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The refinery process for producing reformulated gasoline,
depending upon production criteria, adds 5 to 15 cents per gallon
to the cost of California gasoline, which is among the most
expensive in the nation. Fifty cents per gallon of California gas
is for federal and state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron has about 20 percent of the California market.
</P>
<P>
   The money the state is charging Chevron will go into an account
used to reduce air emissions by funding repair or scrapping of
older, high-polluting automobiles, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident was the third at Chevron's Richmond refinery since
March.
</P>
<P>
   On March 23, a fire shot an 18,000-pound plume of sulfur dioxide
into the air and sent more than 350 area residents to hospitals
with ailments including eye and throat irritation, breathing
trouble, dizziness and nausea. On June 2, a chemical release that
gave some nearby residents headaches and made them nauseous led to
a temporary shutdown of the plant.

 &HT;    LIFE ALONG HEBRON STREET UNDERSCORES U.S. PEACE EFFORTS IN
MIDEAST
 &HT;    880. Moving on (i) international categories.
 &HT;    w/photos.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HEBRON, West Bank _ Despite the optimism of this week's meeting
between President Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
residents of a Hebron street that was meant to symbolize peace
doubt if it will come.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the United States literally tried to pave the way
to peace on Shuhada Street and failed. It's one of many places
where Palestinians wait impatiently for the peace agreements with
Israel to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 U.S.-brokered Hebron agreement turned over most of the
Palestinian city to the Palestinian Authority. It also specified
that about 800 yards of Shuhada, or Martyrs, Street would be paved
and beautified by the Americans right down to painting the shop
doors, installing lampposts and laying brick sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.5 million project was completed in October 1997. But the
Israelis have reneged on their promise to open the road to
Palestinians. They can walk or ride donkeys, but, with a few
exceptions, Palestinians cannot drive on the street. Meanwhile,
vans carrying Jewish settlers whisk down the narrow, but central,
artery.
</P>
<P>
   Shuhada Street was first closedto Palestinian motorists in 1994,
when a Jewish settler killed 29 Palestinians praying nearby.
Israeli authorities said Palestinian drivers would seek revenge on
the settlers who live along the road.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Israeli army road blocks choke off the street of Spanish
lamps, turquoise awnings and closed shops. Palestinian merchants
have been forced to close their shops because customers in the city
of more than 200,000 people can't reach them. The road blocks also
are eroding some Palestinians' trust in America and the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't trust the American administration. They do things just
for the Israelis,'' said shopkeeper Monther Shahin as he looked
down Shuhada Street. ``This street is a big example.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the only example Palestinians see. Throughout the
West Bank, they are impatient for land, access to roads and
economic perks that are promised in stalled agreements. A poll
conducted last month by a West Bank organization showed that 66
percent of Palestinians said they did not trust Barak's new
government to keep peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Most pressing are the provisions in the Wye River agreement,
brokered by Clinton last October but later abandoned by former
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israel has yet to hand
over about another 10 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
Perhaps even more important to Palestinians, the Wye agreement
required Israel to provide them with travel routes between the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank. Such routes would reunite families and
allow merchants to market their goods.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is also late in allowing the Palestinians to begin work
on a port in Gaza, which would create thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The waiting game is visible in Halhul, a city of about 26,000
near Hebron. Civil affairs are governed by Palestinians but the
Israeli military still patrols the city. Two years ago, residents
expected to receive full control. In anticipation, they hung
banners and painted graffiti, but today they still wait to fully
control the city.
</P>
<P>
   Halhul Mayor Mohamad (cq) Milhem wonders why the United States
gives $3 billion a year to Israel, mostly for military purposes,
when he can't get $7 million for a sewage system. He worries that
the stalled peace process is undermining confidence in Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, who sought peace with Israel, and fueling
groups opposed to the peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israelis, Palestinians and Americans must make the best use of
every second,'' Milhem said. ``Time is important because of the
other forces of both Israeli and Palestinian opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   The American CIA has trained and equipped Palestinian police to
deal with Palestinian opponents. But the CIA support is barely
tolerated publicly. Graffiti in Arabic across the street from
Milhem's office states, ``Security cooperation with the CIA is
garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hebron, the leaders of the 52 Jewish families on Shuhada
Street also are suspicious of U.S. involvement in the peace
process. Here, and in a nearby settlement of Kiryat Arba, many
still revere the settler who killed the 29 Arabs and was then
killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   To them, Shuhada Street, which they call King David Street, is a
symbol of American naivete a pointless fantasy of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American dreams about peace are in vain. They don't
understand the situation here. They don't understand the hatred the
Arabs have against the Jews,'' said Noam Arnon, chairman of the
Hebron Jewish community. He warns of a violent ``disaster'' if
Palestinians are allowed to drive down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natshe (cq) said Arafat, when he met with
Barak last week, requested the street be opened to Palestinian
motorists. It would be a welcome gesture for a people losing hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do anything,'' said 90-year-old Nadi Al Jundi as he
hobbled with his cane past the closed shops on Shuhada Street.
``Why not open it? It's a street!''

</P>
<P>
   ``Girls Rule!'' screamed Newsweek's cover story on the U.S.
soccer team's victory in the Women's World Cup. ``Women's sports
take giant leap,'' exulted USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees the tournament was a cultural leap forward--but
in which direction?
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the celebration lurks a struggle between equality
feminists, who think the tournament proved that women can be just
like men, and difference feminists, who think it showed how women
are different and better.
</P>
<P>
   The spin contest covers four issues: individualism, sex,
careerism, and playing dirty.
</P>
<P>
   --Individualism. Equality feminists want each woman to assert
herself. One school of egalitarians sees the World Cup as a
demonstration that women can be ``independent.'' Another school,
illustrated by the Gatorade ad that shows U.S. soccer star Mia Hamm
battling Michael Jordan at various sports, pushes the idea that
women should embrace competition. ``Anything you can do, I can do
better,'' goes the ad's jingle.
</P>
<P>
   A third school, influenced by male sports marketing, selects
certain players on the women's team and pitches them as solo stars.
Several male columnists ignore most of the championship game and
focus on the game-ending goal by American defender Brandi
Chastain--``a shootout, womano a womano,'' with ``one winner, one
loser, everybody holding their breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Difference feminists draw the opposite lessons. They reject the
rampant individualism of ``loutish male basketball and baseball
players,'' as The New York Times' George Vecsey puts it, and they
celebrate the U.S. women's squad as a collectivist countermodel.
``U.S. Takes One for the Team--Collective Selflessness Culminates
in Title at Women's World Cup,'' beams the Washington Post's
front-page headline.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek, picking up the ``selflessness'' theme, praises U.S.
players who ``accepted diminished roles`` and offered ``to do
anything I'm asked for this team.'' Contrary to the Gatorade ad,
the magazine reports with admiration that Hamm ``sees herself as a
solid cog in a remarkably powerful machine'' and ``refuses to
acknowledge that she's a player with unique gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Some difference feminists suggest women are born this way.
Vecsey, for example, calls them ``innately good teammates.'' Others
attribute their selflessness to environmental programming.
According to Newsweek's account of the U.S. team's preparation,
``Roommates were switched at every stop on the World Cup road to
prevent cliques from forming. As the tourney progressed, the
imaging tapes, designed to be watched in private, were shown in
groups.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting collective consciousness is captured in Nike ads
that depict the players doing everything together. In one ad, a
player goes out on a date, and her teammates tag along. In another,
a male dentist who has given one of the players two fillings stares
in amazement as one teammate after another rises, zombielike, to
declare, ``Then I will have two fillings!''
</P>
<P>
   Equality feminists find this celebration of selflessness creepy,
but it's not just being foisted on women by male writers. World Cup
Chairwoman Donna de Varona lauds the American players'
``humility.'' Time columnist Margaret Carlson praises ``their
unassuming ways.'' One player, Kristine Lilly, says the team is
``like a second family. Female sports are different. You do a lot
better when you care about each other. We are nurturing people,
caring people. ... We all want to see each other happy.''
</P>
<P>
   --Sex. Many difference feminists celebrate the U.S. women team's
sex appeal, recycling David Letterman's descriptions of the team as
``Babe City'' and ``Soccer Mamas.'' The icon of these pro-sex
feminists is Chastain, the player who posed nude (but not
lasciviously) in Gear magazine, kicked the winning goal, and then
tore off her jersey and bounded around the field in a black sports
bra. Equality feminists worry that the players' exploitation of
their physiques is self-objectifying and retro.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-sex difference feminists find their heroine under attack
less from the left than from a scandalized news media elite. Sunday
morning talk show hosts asked Chastain in a tone of polite
disbelief what in God's name prompted her to tear off her jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you thinking? What are you doing?'' stammered ABC's
Robin Roberts. Newsweek says Chastain had posed for ``a lowbrow
men's magazine,'' the Post's Ann Gerhart calls it ``the frat boy's
Esquire.'' Time calls her jersey-removal flourish a ``strip`` and
jokes, ``Hey, her name is Chastain, not Chaste.'' Purists prefer to
praise Michelle Akers, the less flashy midfield workhorse who has
pronounced herself ``a bit uncomfortable with Brandi's deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain's defenders offer several counterspins. First there's
the pro-choice defense, which says every woman's choice should be
respected, whether it's running marathons or posing for Gear. Then
there's the ``sexy to be strong'' defense, which praises the U.S.
women for adding muscle tone to our idea of feminine beauty. Then
there's the ``have it all'' defense. As USA Today's Jill Lieber
puts it, the team's ``message'' is that ``you can have it all. ...
That if you're also driven, determined, aggressive, tough and
committed, you can captivate Tom Brokaw, David Letterman and the
nation with your brawn and your brain, your femininity and
sexuality, your athletic skills and your 'babeness.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some equality feminists also take Chastain's side. Their
superficial spin is that male players whip off their shirts all the
time, and women should be able to do the same. Their subtler spin,
well-expressed by Gerhart, is that Chastain ``has brought instant
attention to a piece of clothing that is humble and practical--not
a traditional bra of shine and lace and cleavage, but a sturdy
compression garment. The sports bra is the cloth symbol of Title
IX's success.''
</P>
<P>
   The crudest egalitarian spin is that Chastain is using her sex
appeal to get attention but that this is OK because she's using the
attention to make money, just as men do. As a Newsweek essayist
puts it, the team is ``having some fun--not to mention making some
profit--with America's sexual obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   --Career and family. Equality feminists measure the team's
success by its paychecks, complaining that its salaries are
``meager by men's standards,'' and its bonuses for winning ``pale
in comparison'' to what men get. Noting the team's decision to
arrange its own tour of promotional matches, contrary to plans made
by the U.S. Soccer Federation, the Post says the players are
``determined to promote and pay themselves better than they believe
the [USSF has'' Time, agreeing that the team has boosted its
negotiating leverage, beams, ``Welcome to the big time, ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   Difference feminists reject ``the big time'' as a crude, ugly,
and destructive male pursuit. They celebrate the U.S. women's
comparative innocence. ``In an era when the egos of male athletes
are dwarfed only by their paychecks, the World Cup women, minimum
wagers by pro-sports standards, reminded the country that sports
superstars can be gracious and grateful,'' coos Newsweek. CNN's
Bruce Morton observes approvingly that unlike male athletes, the
female players don't ``have million dollar contracts or big shoe
deals. They actually seem to play because they love their game.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the World Cup coverage exalts players who focus on
their families. Several articles applaud ``soccer moms'' Carla
Overbeck and Joy Fawcett, as well as Hamm's devotion to her Marine
husband overseas (``We've sacrificed so much,'' Hamm told USA
Today). Even the World Cup's CEO, Marla Messing, is glowingly
profiled for stepping aside to stay home with her kids. She ``plans
to turn her attention from filling stadiums nationwide to bringing
a much smaller crowd together: her family,'' the Post reports. Now
``her most serious ambition is to get reacquainted with her husband
... and daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   --Playing dirty. Difference feminists portray women's soccer as
more civil and noble than men's soccer. As Vecsey puts it, women
eschew ``the cynical fouls and flagrant flops of the men.''
Equality feminists draw a different lesson: The World Cup showed
that women can body-slam, curse, and cheat just like men.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these vices has an exemplar on the U.S. team. Akers has
been elected to represent body-slamming, with the Post's William
Gildea calling her ``the Dick Butkus of women's soccer.'' A
13-year-old boy interviewed by the Los Angeles Times pays her the
ultimate adolescent male compliment: ``Michelle Akers, she's my
thug.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain represents crude language as well as physical
immodesty. Before the championship game, she was notorious for
defending her Gear spread by observing, ``I ran my ass off for this
body.''
</P>
<P>
   After she kicked the winning goal, ABC put a microphone in her
face and asked her to tell the nation about Akers. ``She's the
toughest goddamn player I've ever played with or against,''
Chastain blurted. Sportswriters chuckle at Chastain's ``salty''
language and call it ``another step'' toward gender parity in
athletics.
</P>
<P>
   The team's goalie, Briana Scurry, represents cheating. It was
she, more than Chastain, who won the game by blocking one Chinese
kick in the shootout. Scurry did it by sneaking forward, against
the rules, to narrow the shooter's angle before the kick. Far from
chastising Scurry, male sportswriters are congratulating her on her
``savvy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, she said later, she knew she was breaking the rules,''
concludes Bill Plaschke of The Los Angeles Times. ``But because the
referees didn't call it, it apparently falls under the heading of
gamesmanship. 'Everybody does it,' she said. 'It's only cheating if
you get caught.' Sports equality indeed.''

   &UR; By EVE GERBER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush bought a house in 1988 that came with a deed
restricting its use to ``white persons only, excluding bona fide
servants of any race.'' Matt Drudge recently reported the fact and
the Texas governor's office confirmed it the next day. Bush sold
the house in 1995. Is this a scandal?
</P>
<P>
   So-called ``restrictive covenants'' are common in property
deeds. They are a way of enforcing some requirement in perpetuity,
no matter how often the property changes hands. Typical covenants
forbid the onsite consumption of alcohol, the raising of sheep, or
even the display of colored Christmas lights.
</P>
<P>
   Racial covenants limit the use of the property to members of a
specified race or forbid the sale of the property to minorities.
Covenants ``run with the land,'' meaning that future buyers must
abide by their terms.
</P>
<P>
   Racial covenants became common after the Civil War. Early this
century, after the Supreme Court overturned laws that forbade
blacks to live in particular neighborhoods, covenants in deeds
became the only way to maintain legally enforceable racial
segregation. The Federal Housing Administration, established in
1934 to spur homeownership by providing mortgage-loan guarantees,
actually required real estate developers to include racial
covenants in their deeds as a condition of FHA financing.
Levittown, the model for postwar suburbia, excluded blacks through
racial covenanting. All the houses in the Bushes' Dallas
neighborhood have racial covenants. The covenant on the Bush
property dates back to 1939.
</P>
<P>
   A racial covenant is, in theory, a voluntary agreement between
two private citizens, the buyer and seller. As such, it was argued,
a covenant was not affected by the Constitution, which places
limits only on government action.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1948, the Supreme Court held that it would be
unconstitutional for any court, as a government institution, to
enforce a racial covenant. The holding was 6-0; three judges opted
out of the case because they lived in restricted neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1968 the Fair Housing Act outlawed racial discrimination
in housing even by private individuals. It became illegal to refuse
to sell your home on the basis of a prospective buyer's race. The
act specifically forbade any new racial covenants in deeds.
</P>
<P>
   Today racial covenants are unenforceable and irrelevant in the
eyes of the law. Prospective purchasers usually don't even learn of
a racial covenant until after they have contracted to buy a home.
That's when they pay for a ``title search,'' which consists of
tracing ownership back as far as possible from the seller to the
person who sold the property to the seller, to that person's
seller, and so on. The purpose is to make sure the seller actually
has ``good title'' to the property and there are no unexpected
restrictions or burdens on it (such as an earlier mortgage). To
help this process, the law requires that deeds and claims must be
``registered,'' with a copy on file with the local government.
</P>
<P>
   Typically a racial covenant is on file with a deed of many years
ago. Subsequent deeds just say that the buyer takes on any
restriction that the seller took on. A title search attorney might
not even mention a racial covenant to the buyer, since it has no
legal effect. But CNN reports that the Bushes' title company did
include the racial covenant in their report.
</P>
<P>
   Should Bush have insisted on expunging the racial covenant from
his house's title records, even though it was meaningless? It is
possible to do this. Generally, it requires that all parties with
an interest in a property must agree to invalidate the covenant.
That is why a Bush spokesperson claimed that Bush alone could not
remove the racial restriction.
</P>
<P>
   Some covenants require the approval of two-thirds of neighbors
or the permission of a sub-division developer to amend their terms.
A deed may also be amended by filing suit for a declaratory
judgment that racial covenants are null and void. That judgment
would become part of the title, recorded at the registry of land
records. Filing a notarized declaration with a property's deed is
another means of disavowing a racial covenant.
</P>
<P>
   But most people decide, not unreasonably, that expunging a
meaningless provision in a legal document isn't worth the trouble
and expense.
</P>
<P>
   Other public figures embarrassed by revelations that their
property was once encumbered by racial restrictions include: John
F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and even the senior
George Bush.

HIS LIFE HAS BEEN FOR THE BIRDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   European swifts are so at home in the air, they even sleep and
mate on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   The albatross, with its 6-foot wingspan, is willing to travel
1,000 miles to bring home the birdie equivalent of the bacon for
its chicks.
</P>
<P>
   And the lyre bird of Australia, which mixes medleys of other
bird songs with its own, is such an adept and even modern mimic
that it often folds the sounds of chainsaws, car alarms, and camera
shutter clicks into its already elaborate repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   These are but a few of the remarkable animals you'll meet in Sir
David Attenborough's new 10-part series ``The Life of Birds'' for
PBS, which starts Tuesday at 8 p.m. It's a wild flight through
avian diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Attenborough himself is a pretty fascinating bird. He
is a pioneer of natural history filmmaking for TV. He's the
godfather. In fact, if the field of nature documentaries were
structured like the Mafia, Attenborough would be the capo di tutti
capo.
</P>
<P>
   But that, of course, is a funny image of the consummate British
gentleman. The kind of fellow who says things such as ``he's a
flash chap'' or ``jolly nearly.'' A man who has been knighted. The
brother of famed filmmaker and actor Sir Richard Attenborough.
</P>
<P>
   David Attenborough, 73, has been leading the pack in nature TV
for 46 years through his films on the BBC. And he is nothing like
our blown-dry, painted-up American on-air ``talents.'' He writes
his own scripts. He doesn't use a teleprompter. There are
exclamation points aplenty in his delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Attenborough, a trained biologist, simply cannot contain his
enthusiasm on camera.
</P>
<P>
   He wriggles his body, bobs his head, and flashes his eyes in an
elaborate and enchanting courtship dance with the audience. Who can
resist?
</P>
<P>
   In this series, he appears at sundown before a bat cave in Texas
as millions of the winged predators mob the sky. He sneaks up on a
takahe, a nearly extinct native of New Zealand. A massive golden
eagle flies to his gloved fist. And we watch him crawl on his belly
on a dark beach in New Zealand as he trains his ``torch'' on a
foraging kiwi. In one scene, Attenborough stands near a tree in
Japan where shearwaters patiently queue up to climb and then launch
themselves into the air. Here, he is almost unrecognizable _ and
you realize it's because his hair is combed.
</P>
<P>
   It's only natural that he gets a little disheveled. He's braved
heat, cold, tsetse flies, and more. He's been chased _ on camera _
by angry animals, including massive elephant seal bulls. But he
dismisses the danger. By phone from New York City, he says, ``Well,
if you stand in front of the No. 11 bus, you're going to get run
over. Seriously, the only danger I face is because of my own
extreme foolishness or that of other human beings. There is just no
need to be silly.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing silly about this new series, which is as
engrossing as it is encyclopedic. It took three years, 48 camera
people, and more than $12 million to make. It involved 70 trips to
42 countries on all seven continents.
</P>
<P>
   More than 9,000 species of bird were captured _ on film that is
_ by night-vision cameras, micro-cameras, and by ``ultra-slow
motion'' photography. One cameraman had to lie in a pit for three
weeks to record the mating practices of the hedge sparrow.
</P>
<P>
   As we learn about the big issues _ ``To Fly or Not to Fly,''
``Signals and Songs,'' ``Finding Partners'' _ we watch vivid
vignettes.
</P>
<P>
   --The bee eater who, true to its name, nabs a sting-bearing
victim and, with a sharp nip, gets it to release its venom
harmlessly into the air _ spraying out in a slow-motion arc of
sparkling beads.
</P>
<P>
   --The albatross, who is so lyrical in the air, approaches the
beach, legs akimbo, and then plows the sand with its breastbone in
a landing that is ``scarcely better than a controlled accident.''
</P>
<P>
   --The plump grebe pair who put the hippos of ``Fantasia'' to
shame with their upright, perfectly synchronized, above-water pas
de deux.
</P>
<P>
   Attenborough's enthusiasm certainly seems justified. And it's
pretty easy to provoke. Just ask him his favorite bird.
</P>
<P>
   His love of birds of paradise, he says, ``is obsession to the
point of lunacy.'' Once, filming in New Guinea, Attenborough and a
cameraman crawled through thick, wet forest in an attempt to film
the rarely seen courtship display. His producer waited 100 feet
below during the dicey moments of stalking the quarry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fan-TAS-tic!'' Attenborough shouts. They got the
activity on film. And as soon as it was over, Attenborough ran down
the hillside to his producer. `` `Dickie! Dickie!' I cried, `We got
it! We got it!' ''
</P>
<P>
   I know you did, he was told. But how could you know from down
here? Attenborough asked.
</P>
<P>
   The producer reported that he could hear Attenborough's
heartbeat through the microphone and it was racing ``at double
speed.''
</P>

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: The perfect gesture
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Brandi Chastain whipped off her shirt in celebration of her
winning penalty kick in the World Cup soccer match against China,
there was an immediate _ and predictable _ complaint. ``More
filth!'' some cried. Still are.
</P>
<P>
   Male athletes tear off their shirts all the time. Few notice,
except when the men are excessively hairy. Men also spill huge
containers of Gatorade on unsuspecting coaches in moments of joy,
and everybody thinks that's just good, old-fashioned American fun.
There is no longer any excuse for any coach anywhere to be
surprised by a victory shower in orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   Let a grown woman expose her sports bra, and people begin
blacking out from coast to coast. I thought it was the perfect
gesture that combined the joy of victory with the special joy in
that moment of being a woman.

A RETURN TO SPRINGSTEEN'S GLORY DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Bruce Springsteen may not always like being
called the Boss, but how else do you describe someone who has
smashed box office records everywhere this year? He and his E
Street Band sold out 15 shows and 300,000 tickets in one day (for a
reported gross of $18 million) in his home state of New Jersey,
where he launched his US tour with a three-hour, sweat-drenched
rock 'n' roll bliss fest Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen came to ``regenerate you and re-sexualate you,'' he
said in a preacherlike mode as fans raised their hands toward this
rock hall of fame evangelist. And during an encore, he described
the tour as a ``rebirth and a rededication of the band _ and a
commitment to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me while I testify!'' he said repeatedly, echoing an
old R&AMP;B refrain, as he raced around like a man possessed. He was
exhausting to watch _ nothing new there _ and he again gave his
all, venturing through the back streets of his darker songs, the
party ethic of his happy-hour tunes, and the social conscience of
his working-class anthems that have stood the test of time.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Springsteen we know and love is back. And
what a difference from his last tour with a band _ the 1992
experience with studio musicians whose names only a few diehards
can even remember. This time, he was reunited with his E Street
brothers for the first time in 12 years _ and the bonhomie was
evident from the first, crackling number, ``My Love Will Not Let
You Down,'' from Springsteen's boxed set, ``Tracks.'' They pushed
him, he pushed them, and there was none of the tentativeness that
marred the '92 tour.
</P>
<P>
   What made it more special was the pairing for the first time of
guitarists Nils Lofgren and Miami Steve Van Zandt, who had
previously been in the band at different times. They came out arm
in arm and they played that way, giving more muscle to the
harder-rocking songs, while staying out of each other's way
beautifully on softer numbers.
</P>
<P>
   During the first half of Thursday night's show, the normally
loquacious Springsteen said barely a word, preferring just to play
music. If you had a band that handled like a Ferrari, wouldn't you
drive it? As Springsteen sang in the tumultuous ``Out on the
Street'': ``I'll drive the way I want to drive.''
</P>
<P>
   And he drove ferociously early on, belting through ``Promised
Land,'' ``Two Hearts,'' ``Darkness on the Edge of Town'' (still as
apocalyptic as ever), and an archival treat, ``Darlington County.''
</P>
<P>
   He then changed the mood radically, offering the Hank
Williams-style country of ``Mansion on the Hill'' and an artful
reworking of ``The River,'' with Lofgren on pedal steel and Van
Zandt on mandolin. It showed that Springsteen is not treating his
music like a collection of fossils, but is determined to bring new
life to it. And he ended the song with a keening wail that
transfixed the crowd and showed that his vocal range has grown, not
ebbed, in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   He picked things up with the blue-collar ``Youngstown'' and
erupted on ``Badlands'' (playing his own raging lead guitar solo)
and ``10th Avenue Freezeout.'' The latter brought his first verbal
reminiscence about his Jersey boyhood, ``when I walked down the
avenue of lust . . . fear . . . hope . . . despair . . .
self-interest . . . and the avenue of sexual pleasure, a popular
avenue.'' He later revisited his youth in a new tune, ``Freehold,''
a sardonic, coffeehouse-style, ``Whitmanesque'' solo ditty that
recalled his Catholic grammar school education and his ``first kiss
in a YMCA canteen on a Friday night.''
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen's softer side was marked by a solo ``Ghost of Tom
Joad'' and a haunting ``Streets of Philadelphia,'' but he soon
revved up again with ``Backstreets'' (with saxophonist Clarence
Clemons blowing feverishly), a metallic ``Light of Day,'' and
delirious encores spanning ``Hungry Heart,'' ``Bobby Jean,'' and
``Thunder Road.'' It was just the thunder the crowd had waited all
these years to hear.

   &UR; By DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   What a difference a plane ride makes. The Israel I left last
Sunday was a nation queasy about peace talks and anxious about its
new prime minister, Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's governing coalition was already squabbling viciously, a
party allied with Barak had splintered and collapsed, the
opposition had called for a no-confidence vote, West Bank and Golan
settlers were readying PR campaigns against Barak's peace schemes,
and my in-laws were shouting at the television every time Barak
came on the screen: ``He wants to give it all away!''
</P>
<P>
   But landing in Washington on Monday, I touched down in the
middle of Barak Euphoria. During his U.S. visit this week, Barak
has travelled not by limousine but on a cushion of perfumed air.
</P>
<P>
   The Israel Policy Forum's new poll of American Jews finds almost
universal support for Barak and his peace proposals. His American
visit includes a triumphal march through the Sunday talk shows,
backslapping meetings with the U.S. president and vice president,
and glowing newspaper profiles.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has rarely seemed giddier about a foreign visitor:
American papers have suggested that ``peace is just around the
corner,'' that Israel is united behind its new chief, that final
rapprochement with the Palestinians, Syrians, and Lebanese is just
a matter of proofreading the treaties and scheduling a few
ceremonial handshakes in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   This discontinuity between the thrill in the air here and the
``facts on the ground'' there (to use a favorite Israelism) is
striking and worrisome. America seems to be mistaking the
opportunity of peace talks for the reality of a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge facing Barak in the face of this euphoria is the
danger of unrealistic expectations,'' says Tom Smerling, director
of the Israel Policy Forum's Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   True, Barak's election is a welcome event for Israel and its
Arab neighbors. Benjamin Netanyahu was widely mistrusted and
despised by Israelis, and universally mistrusted and despised by
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Israelis (admittedly a narrow one) favors peace
talks, and Barak is the best negotiator Israel could send to the
table. He has constructed a broad coalition of pro-peace parties.
He has assuaged Israelis by presenting a hard vision of peace:
Barak's peace with the Palestinians will be a divorce, not a
marriage (as former Prime Minister Shimon Peres imagined).
</P>
<P>
   But while Barak may be the best prime minister to bring peace,
that does not mean peace will come. Enormous obstacles remain,
obstacles that an exultant America should stop and remember.
</P>
<P>
   1. The chasm between Israeli and Palestinian visions of peace.
Peace with Syria is a (relatively) easy matter for Israel. Israel
will surrender the Golan (except for a surveillance base), the
territory will be demilitarized, and Syria will stop Hezbollah
guerillas from operating in South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian problem is much more difficult. Barak and Arafat
are willing to conduct final negotiations, but that does not mean
their positions can be reconciled. Barak may have been elected
largely because he was not Netanyahu, but Barak's publicly stated
peace proposals are similar to Netanyahu's. The Palestinians
demand: all the West Bank, Jerusalem as their capital, the right of
1948 and 1967 refugees to return, full statehood, and Israeli
withdrawal from settlements. Barak rejects all these conditions,
except perhaps statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most optimistic Middle East analysts succumb to
paralysis when they try to resolve these disagreements. Barak is
likely to concede the Palestinians a capital just outside Jerusalem
and to allow some refugees to return to the West Bank (though not
to Israel proper), but he certainly won't give up all the West Bank
or even a square inch of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, who grabbed the moral high ground when
Netanyahu sabotaged negotiations, have so far shown little
willingness to moderate their demands.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis and the Palestinians (understandably) delayed
resolving these issues until final status talks because they were
intractable. Now final status talks have arrived and, lo and
behold, the issues are still intractable. Already some are
predicting the ``final'' talks won't be final at all: Israel and
the Palestinians will again kick the questions of Jerusalem and
refugees down the road.
</P>
<P>
   2. Heightened Arab-Jewish tension. The mutual loathing and
mistrust that divides Israelis and Palestinians is bad enough
already, but the peace process promises to exacerbate it.
</P>
<P>
   Serious peace negotiations are expected to spark anti-Jewish
terrorism by Palestinian extremists bent on sabotaging a
half-a-loaf agreement. Jewish extremists will be no happier.
Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank may leave Jewish settlements
encircled by Palestinian territory. Surrounding well-armed and
enraged Jewish settlers with Palestinian land is a recipe for
disaster. Anti-Jewish terrorism during the peace talks of the
mid-'90s contributed to the Peres government's defeat. Barak's
fragile coalition is equally vulnerable if terrorism or settler
violence surges. Support for peace could dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   3. Heightened Jewish-Jewish tension. The peace process also
endangers intra-Jewish relations, which are already fraught.
Religious Jews are feuding with secular Jews. Sephardic Jews are
battering the Ashkenazi establishment about decades of
discrimination. Russian immigrants are fighting with the Orthodox
rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   Any Palestinian agreement will probably require Barak to remove
or consolidate West Bank settlements. Any Syrian agreement will
undoubtedly require Barak to remove all Golan Heights settlements.
There are 170,000 Jews on the West Bank and 17,000 in the Golan.
Most of them strongly oppose any plan to uproot them.
</P>
<P>
   Israel had a nervous breakdown when Menachem Begin evicted just
5,000 settlers from the Sinai during the early '80s. Today's
settlers, especially West Bankers, are far more militant than their
'80s counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Some religious settlers deny the authority of the Israeli
government and believe it is their biblical duty to populate the
West Bank (''Judea and Samaria''). They will not leave quietly. It
is difficult to conceive how Barak can remove 17,000 folks from the
Golan and thousands more from the West Bank without fracturing his
government.
</P>
<P>
   4. The instability of Syria and the Palestinian Authority.
Syrian strongman Hafez Assad is old and ailing. His son and heir,
Bashar, is inexperienced (he's an ophthalmologist by training).
Assad's ruling Alawites are a tenuous minority, only 11 percent of
the population.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's former patron, the Soviet Union, is dead. Syria's
economy is totally broken. As long as Assad lives, he can manage
these troubles and keep an agreement with Israel. But if he dies,
it's not clear that Syria can control Lebanon or that the Golan
border will remain peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian situation is more perilous. Arafat is also
ailing and has no clear successor. His authoritarian rule has
prevented the emergence of future leaders and the development of
strong civic and political institutions. Extremists (such as Hamas)
and moderates are already jockeying for power. The Palestinian
economy is a disaster, devastated by Israeli limits on Palestinians
working in Israel. The return of hundreds of thousands of destitute
Palestinian refugees from camps in Lebanon and Jordan will only
compound the economic misery.
</P>
<P>
   So if Barak gets his final deal with the Palestinians, Israel
may find itself with a new kind of problem: an autonomous
Palestinian state, a stone's throw (literally) from sacred Israeli
territory, that is sinking into Third World poverty, anarchy, and
civil war. This could be a peace, even a good peace, but it won't
be cause for euphoria.

 NEW YORK: little flavor.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The flesh of Eastern melons is not as firm as that of Western
melons, and they tend to taste muskier. One of the best is the
ambrosia. The Saticoy is firmer and is sometimes sweeter than
ambrosia, sometimes not. Gold Star is juicy but not as flavorful.
</P>
<P>
   The finest local melon, by most accounts, seldom makes its way
to markets in New York City. Hand melons from Greenwich, N.Y.,
named for the family that has grown them since 1925, should be
available in a few weeks in the Greenwich area (they are a
breakfast tradition at Saratoga Race Track). Because of careful
harvesting or because the microclimate in which they grow is
particularly salubrious, they are succulently sweet.
</P>
<P>
   The finest from California come from ``the west side,'' says
Harold Seybert, an owner of Fairway. The reference is to the west
side of the fertile San Joaquin Valley, where the days are hot and
the nights are warm, perfect growing conditions for melons to ripen
evenly. Markets often advertise the melons as ``west side'' because
they are so good.
</P>
<P>
   During the rest of the year, melons are harvested in places
where the temperature often spikes, so the fruit does not ripen or
color evenly. And of course, the farther the melons have to travel,
the firmer they must be when harvested. No wonder melons out of
season are usually a terrible disappointment _ rock hard and
practically tasteless.
</P>
<P>
   Local melons are expected to be superb this year because of the
hot weather, but they may not be plentiful because there has been
so little rain. California has also had a good season. At the
Greenmarkets in New York City, 1.5-pound local melons are expected
to sell for about $3 each, the same price as last year. California
melons are selling for $3 to $7 each, depending on where they are
purchased.
</P>
<P>
   Melons have been around for millenniums. Watermelons alone have
been traced to prehistoric times, when they were introduced to
India from their native soil of southern Africa. Egyptians were
eating them around 4,000 B.C. They reached the New World in 1493,
when Columbus took melon seeds to Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of muskmelons is a little more obscure. They come
from either Africa or India, and just to confuse matters more, what
we call cantaloupes are actually muskmelons. Cantaloupes are found
in Europe: the name comes from Cantalupo, a former papal garden
near Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Melons have long been treated as culinary treasures, and not
just in Renaissance France. This was true even before anyone cared
that they are very low in calories and have no fat, or that
orange-fleshed melons have lots of vitamins A and C.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have been trying various culinary experiments with
melons for decades. Before Prohibition, watermelons were filled
with alcohol and left to marinate overnight, a tradition still
observed at many beach parties. There were several recipes in the
1940s and '50s for filling a melon with flavored gelatin. And of
course, there have always been watermelon pickles.
</P>
<P>
   But the recipes that chefs in the '90s have created with melons
are considerably more imaginative and appealing. There are
delightful soups at Bouley Bakery, Cello, Montrachet, the Cub Room,
Daniel, Aureole and Chianti, as well as a particularly refreshing
sorbet at March and another at the River Cafe. And then there is
the traditional melon-and-prosciutto combination that has been
enhanced with figs at Le Cirque 2000.
</P>
<P>
   How do you choose a good melon? There are some rules, starting
with the fact that all melons should feel heavy. A good sign of
ripeness for most melons is a clean break between the melon and
stem rather than a cut in the stem itself, because when most melons
are perfectly ripe, they separate naturally from the plant.
</P>
<P>
   As with other fruits and vegetables, the moment of harvest is
crucial, because melons do not ripen further once they are picked,
although they continue to soften. Some melons, like Persians,
cantaloupes and casabas, have a little softness at the blossom end
when ripe, while others do not.
</P>
<P>
   The skin of a honeydew and other smooth melons should feel
velvety. Honeydews also have a creamy-golden tinge; avoid those
with a greenish hue. Melons that have netted skins should have a
yellowish, not green, color under the netting.
</P>
<P>
   Watermelons should sound hollow when thumped. The bottom side
should be yellowish, not white. With cut watermelon, look for the
thinnest skin and the brightest flesh, be it red, yellow or, new
this year, orange.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid melons that are too firm or too soft or that have sunken
spots on the skin.
</P>
<P>
   A ripe melon can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of
days, but it is better to eat it before it has been refrigerated.
</P>
<P>
   And there are better things to do with the juice of a watermelon
than to let it dribble down your chin. Puree seeded chunks of
melon, strain the juice, and shake it over ice with lemon-flavored
vodka. You'll never know what hit you.

</P>
<P>
   1 small melon (Cavaillon, cantaloupe or honeydew), skin and

<P>
   1 tablespoon acacia or other good-quality honey
</P>
<P>
   [ teaspoon salt

<P>
   With the simplest embellishment, a melon can be transformed into
a light dessert or refreshing first course. Here are a few
suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cut a small melon like a Cavaillon in half, remove the seeds
and make a few slashes in the flesh. Fill the cavity with port wine
or moscato d'Asti, and refrigerate for eight hours or more. Or do
what Le Cirque 2000 does: serve a glass of port on the side, or
pour it in.
</P>
<P>
   _ For James Beard's Drunken Melon, cut a 2-inch-square plug in a
watermelon deep enough to go into the cavity. Deeply prick the
flesh with an ice pick, and fill to near the top with light rum,
Cognac, Champagne or gin. Replace the plug, and seal with heavy
tape. Refrigerate the melon for 24 hours, turning it over four or
five times. Serve sliced.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sprinkle slices or chunks with lime juice and dash of cayenne.
</P>
<P>
   _ Serve thin slices with prosciutto and figs, or with capocollo
or Smithfield ham and freshly ground black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   _ Drizzle wedges with hazelnut or orange liqueur, or sprinkle
with powdered ginger or finely cut candied ginger.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gently toss watermelon cubes in a mixture of lime juice,
tequila, hot pepper sauce and salt.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that room-temperature melons have the best flavor
but that in the heat of summer, the well-chilled melon is most
appealing.

PATIENTS' RIGHTS BILL BOOSTS HOPE FOR CANCER PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 18)   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The patients rights' legislation that passed the
Senate last week held some good news for cancer patients seeking to
participate in federal clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, the bill would require managed care providers
to pay for costs related to the trials.
</P>
<P>
   A patient in a clinical trial agrees to undergo an experimental
treatment so researchers can test a new drug, device, or
combination of already approved treatments that have shown promise.
Such trials are often the last recourse for patients who haven't
been helped by traditional therapies.
</P>
<P>
   While the drug company or the manufacturer picks up the cost of
the new treatment, other expenses such as hospitalization, extra
tests and additional doctor visits often are not paid for by either
the drug company or the patient's managed care plan.
</P>
<P>
   Many would-be trial participants are deterred from taking part
because those extra expenses _ for an extra CT scan or a surgical
procedure that might be needed to monitor potential affects of a
new treatment _ can run into the thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate measure would require some managed care providers to
pay ``routine patient costs'' of cancer clinical trials sponsored
by the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Veterans
Affairs or the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Federal researchers are now conducting more than 2,000 cancer
clinical trials. Such trials may have as few as a dozen
participants or as many as 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., the prime sponsor of the proposal,
claimed that cost is the primary reason that only 2 percent of
cancer patients agree to take part in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Mack is a survivor of melanoma. His wife, Priscilla, is a breast
cancer survivor and their daughter, Debbie, is a cervical cancer
survivor. Mack lost his younger brother, Michael to melanoma, his
mother died of esophageal cancer and his mother died of kidney
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., complained that valuable medical
research is being jeopardized because, she said, HMOs are cutting
back on paying costs associated with clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starting to see fewer clinical trials because HMOs
won't pay,'' she said. ``That not only hurts the patients but
stands in the way of research.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack likens participants in clinical trials to astronauts who
are willing to risk their lives to push science into new frontiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cancer clinical trials are one of the most beneficial ways
doctors can determine which treatments are most effective against
cancer,'' Mack said. He said the new bill ``breaks down the cost
barrier and ensures that our family, friends and loved ones are not
shut out from receiving promising new treatments simply because of
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate measure would apply to 48 million people who receive
health care coverage through large employers who insure themselves
by funding their own claims and hiring a managed care provider to
administer the plan.
</P>
<P>
   It would not apply to 113 million people with private insurance.
And it would not apply to hundreds of clinical trials conducted by
pharmaceutical companies and academic medical centers.
</P>
<P>
   The House has yet to consider patients' rights legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Mary McCabe, director of the office of clinical research
promotion for the National Cancer Institute, the nation's chief
cancer funding agency, said the Senate legislation is ``very
important good news for the oncology community. It's an opportunity
both for patients and for researchers to conduct clinical trials
and get important answers to cancer questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate rejected a proposal sponsored by Sen. Christopher J.
Dodd, D-Conn., that would have required health plans to pay costs
connected with all federally sponsored clinical trials, including
clinical trials of diseases such as AIDS, Parkinsons and Alzheimers
disease, multiple sclerosis, diabetes and Lupus.

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a physician who takes a leadership
role on almost all health-related legislation, said Republicans
decided to limit the coverage to cancer patients because they
didn't ``want to impose exorbitant costs'' on managed care
providers.
</P>
<P>
   Frist said the Democratic proposal ``opens the door so broadly
it has the potential for premiums to skyrocket.'' He said there
isn't enough data on clinical trials for diseases other than cancer
to know how much the associated costs could be.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP legislation would set up a panel to determine by 2000
which ``routine patient costs'' should be paid by insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Carmella Bocchino, vice president for medical affairs for the
American Association of Health Plans, which represents the managed
care industry, says it's unclear how much money is involved in
``costs associated with routine patient care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could put five people in a room and ask them to define
routine patient care and you'd get six different answers,'' she
said. ``There could be a whole slew of tests'' needed to take part
in a trial.

REPLANTED IN FRANCE, ALGERIAN ARTS BLOOM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France)  (js) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ As Algeria's civil war escalated through the 1990s, the
demise of the country's cultural and intellectual life seemed
almost incidental compared to a civilian death toll rising above
50,000 and an economy in disarray. Culture, however, was not an
accidental casualty of war. In a carefully orchestrated campaign to
smother intellectual freedom, artists, movie and theater directors,
writers, singers and journalists were singled out for death threats
and murder.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the terror, it was never clear who was ordering the
killings. Islamic fundamentalists who took up arms in the early
1990s were blamed for most attacks on what they considered decadent
Western-influenced culture, but the army-backed regime and its
shadowy allies were also infamously intolerant of criticism. ``Not
only the Islamists kill, that's for sure,'' Karim Sarroub, a young
Algerian novelist, said in an interview. ``Neither side likes
intellectuals.''
</P>
<P>
   The murder of some 70 journalists over an eight-year period
decimated Algeria's tiny independent press, while the assassination
of prominent cultural figures _ among them the revered popular
singers Cheb Hasni and Matoub Lounes, the playwright Abdelkader
Alloula, the poet Tahar Djaout and the director of the national
theater, Azzedamine Medjoubi _ demonstrated that no one was safe.
Soon, a good part of the surviving cultural elite had fled the
country, with most of them seeking exile in France.
</P>
<P>
   What followed, though, was not what the enemies of artistic
expression in Algeria might have hoped. Instead of fading away,
contemporary Algerian culture is now very much alive and well _ in
exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crisis has led to an extraordinary explosion of energy,''
said Rachida Krim, a French-born Algerian movie director whose
recent films, ``Sous les Pieds des Femmes'' (``Under Women's
Feet'') and ``La Femme Devoilee'' (``The Unveiled Woman''), have
focused on Arab women. ``Algerian writers, musicians, painters,
moviemakers and actors have never been so active. They have an
energy that children of immigrants rarely show. They work hard with
the intention of learning what they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Leila Marouane, a former journalist in her early 30s whose life
was repeatedly threatened in Algeria, is just one writer who has
seen her career blossom since she settled here six years ago. Her
first novel, ``La Fille de la Casbah,'' was published in 1996 and
short-listed for the prestigious Prix Goncourt, while her second,
``Ravisseur,'' published here last year, will appear in English as
``The Abductor'' next year. ``If I can return to Algeria, I will do
so with pleasure,'' she said. ``But only when it is really safe. I
don't want to find myself chopped up into pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Exile is of course a path taken by generations of independent
artists determined to escape persecution and preserve their
creative freedom. Just this century, for example, untold thousands
fled Hitler's Germany, Communist governments in Europe, Cuba and
China, and right-wing dictatorships in Spain, Latin America, Greece
and South Africa. Some, like the black American writers who came to
Paris in the 1950s, simply felt more welcome abroad. And frequently
their best work was done in exile.
</P>
<P>
   The Algerians' choice of France as a safe haven is logical. For
one thing, it is Algeria's former colonial ruler and already home
to close to 1 million Algerian immigrants. For another, educated
Algerians are French-speakers and familiar with French culture,
which, even after independence in 1962, continued to exercise
influence in Algeria. ``The French I speak is part of my Algerian
cultural identity,'' said Hamid Tassili, 31, a movie director who
moved here three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   France also has other attractions. While cultural activity in
Algeria was limited as much by the economic crisis as by political
threats, France provides huge government subsidies for the arts,
above all for museums, the movie industry, theater, classical music
and dance. Further, French publishers have shown special interest
in foreign authors writing in French. In France Algerian artists
have found a structure within which to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not have lived off my writing in Algeria,'' explained
a journalist turned novelist known only by the initials Y.B., whose
latest book is called ``L'Explication'' (``The Explanation'').
``There was no way a writer could dedicate two years to writing a
book and stay alive. Here, if you are careful, you can live off
royalties.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The greatest success story, though, involves Algerian rai
singers because their success is truly commercial. Some already had
big followings in Algeria and across North Africa before the
crisis, but in exile they have been snapped up by international
record companies and turned into stars. They have a natural
audience in Western Europe's vast North African immigrant
population, but rai love songs have also benefited from the growing
popularity of world music. ``Rai is almost middle-class French
music now,'' said Y.B.
</P>
<P>
   Khaled, a handsome and charming performer now in his 40s who
sings in French as well as Arabic, is the best-known Algerian
singer today. But many others, among them Cheb Mami, Rachid Taha
and Cheba Fadela, routinely draw thousands to their concerts. One
of the youngest stars, Faudel Belloua, was in fact born in France
of Algerian parents, but his music, a mixture of rai, rap and
world-music pop, also has its roots in the Algerian tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Other exiled artists also use Algeria as raw material for their
creative work. Ms. Marouane's ``Abductor,'' for instance, portrays
the isolated universe of Algerian women through the story of a
middle-aged couple whose love for each other is undermined by
Islamic law. Amin Zaoui, who was supported by the Strasbourg-based
International Writers' Parliament after he fled Algeria in 1994,
uses Algeria's violence as the background for the two stories in
his 1998 book, ``Le Sommeil du Mimosa'' (``The Sleep of Mimosa'').
Abdelkader Djemai named his new novel, ``31, Rue de l'Aigle'' (``31
Eagle Road'') after the fictional address of a secret police unit
in Algiers.
</P>
<P>
   The theater world has also brought Algeria's problems to the
French stage. One of the first of a slew of plays, Slimane
Benaissa's ``Fils de l'Amertume'' (``Sons of Bitterness''),
illustrates the divisions in Algeria through Farid, a rootless
young man who becomes an Islamic extremist, and Youcef, a veteran
journalist whom Farid is ordered to murder. Another play, ``Algerie
en Eclats'' (``Algeria in Pieces''), set in a theater during a
rehearsal, uses texts from 21 Algerian writers, six of whom have
been murdered. An Algerian actor known only as Fellag has also
toured his one-man show around France.
</P>
<P>
   French-speaking Algerian actors have been able to find work in
French movies or on television, albeit invariably playing Arabs.
Some Algerian movie directors, eager to make films about Algeria,
occasionally return home to work, although they assume great risks
when they go on location. On the other hand, French production
companies have been willing to back a few Algerian movies, aware of
residual French interest in what for almost two centuries was
France's most important colony.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the least visible of exiled Algerian artists are
painters and sculptors, if only because visual arts education in
Algeria was traditionally limited. Nonetheless, a few like Slimane
Ould Mohand and Mahdjoub Ben Bella have been picked up by French
galleries and have had one-man exhibitions. The abstract painter
Ali Silem and the sculptor Abdel-slam Graine have also begun to win
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   That said, except for those with families already in France,
exiles often face economic difficulties and adjustment problems.
``For the first few months, I was depressed,'' recalled Tassili,
who worked with Ms. Krim on ``La Femme Devoilee.'' ``Then I
thought, `I can express myself through my work and can remain in
touch with my culture and my country.'''
</P>
<P>
   French society can also be unwelcoming toward Arabs. ``In my
building, there is only one person who treats me without
condescension,'' Ms. Marouane said with a laugh. ``She is blind.
She can only hear my voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, given the horrors regularly convulsing Algeria, the mood
of the exiled artists here is upbeat. They are safe, and many of
them are enjoying more success than would have been possible in
Algeria. Unsurprisingly, they have no immediate plans to return
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Algerian culture is going through a period of great
vitality,'' said Y.B., ``but it's happening outside our
frontiers.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tracey Jackson's collection of nearly 100 handbags is
displayed with a reverence usually reserved for reliquary objects.
The purses _ limited-edition Gucci bags, one-of-a-kind vintage
styles, beaded pouches from India _ rest on tables and shelves all
around her Upper East Side town house. ``Not just the usual 10021
collection,'' Ms. Jackson proudly pointed out, referring to her ZIP
code.
</P>
<P>
   Her most prized pocketbook, what might be called the holy of
holies, is an oversize Hermes satchel in buttery tan leather. Ms.
Jackson, a screenwriter, first spotted the limited-edition style in
Hawaii a few months ago, on the arm of a Japanese tourist. The
woman spoke no English but understood the word Hermes _ a universal
language, noted Ms. Jackson, who then tracked down the bag in
Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a bag freak,'' Ms. Jackson confessed, and there is no
doubting her. She recently sold a script to Working Title, the
English film production company, about a wife and a mistress who
accidentally switch Hermes Kelly bags. ``If I was down to my last
$1,000, I'd buy a purse,'' she said. ``I think about them every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Hers is an obsession shared by more and more women these days,
as ornamentation and color continue to invigorate fashion, spicing
up the minimalism of the mid-'90s. The basic black leather bag, a
staple of most every woman's wardrobe, looks tired by comparison to
newer purses in unusual fabrics or embellished with embroidery,
beading and fur. The accessories market, whether low- or high-end,
is peaking in part because of widespread handbag fever.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, women are parading out of stores with new
purses in hand. At Barneys New York, handbag sales since February
are up 31 percent compared with the same period last year. Stanley
Korshak, a luxury retail store in Dallas where novelty purses are
outselling black ones, has also seen a 30 percent increase in
handbag sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   No industrywide figures exist, but almost everyone in the
handbag business reports excellent sales, for a few basic reasons:
the note of indulgence that bags lend to monochromatic dressing
styles, their relative affordability as status labels and the
successful marketing of the notion that women ought to acquire a
``wardrobe'' of handbags for all occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the continuing reign of minimalist clothing, when it is
nearly impossible to distinguish a Calvin Klein ensemble from a
Helmut Lang ensemble, a handbag sets a woman apart, said Valerie
Steele, chief curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of
Technology. ``Clothes are sort of anonymous,'' she said. ``You make
your fashion statement now with the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the sort of thing fashion professionals said about shoes
not long ago, to explain the profusion and popularity of styles
from $500 spike heels to high-tech running sneakers to hippie-style
sandals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is the turn of the handbag. ``Bags are fresher now,''
said Ms. Steele, who is writing a book, ``Bags: A Lexicon of
Style,'' to be published by Rizzoli in November. ``Historically,
women are always into shoes, but this year bags have taken off, and
they are the current mania.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginny Bond Donahue, 27, an aspiring actress in New York, has
acquired a dozen purses since March, more than she had bought in
the two years before that. ``I used to dress from the shoes up,''
she said. ``Now, I dress from the bag around. I'll work an outfit
around my purse.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Kessler, accessories director of Vogue, says that many
women are thinking similar thoughts when getting dressed. ``It used
to be the bag and shoes could save an outfit,'' she said. ``Now,
it's the bag and shoes that can make an outfit.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Shepherd, one of the owners of Kirna Zabete, a boutique
soon to open in SoHo, said, ``I'll buy any sort of bag, from a
cheap African basket off the street to a pink Louis Vuitton.'' In
her apartment, a personal cache of 200 purses hangs from a coat
rack. When she and her partner, Sarah Hailes, were accumulating
inventory for their store, they were so enticed by the fall handbag
selection that they had to cut back on their clothing budget. ``I
can't get enough of them,'' Ms. Shepherd said. ``I'm constantly
changing my bags. If I go away on vacation for a week, I'll take 15
bags.''

SENATORS WARN OF GAP IN INTERNET USE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Calling access to the Internet the next great civil
rights battle, two senators promised Friday to fight for programs
aimed at helping minorities and rural residents get online.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John D. Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said a recent Commerce
Department report showing growing gaps in Internet use between
whites and some minorities and between urban and rural Americans
was a ``threat'' to the country's political system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our democracy is based on informed voters and on the idea that
each citizen has the same opportunities to succeed,'' he told a
meeting of the Senate Science and Technology Caucus that was
studying the report's findings.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Unless we change these trends, opportunity to use
the Internet will become this country's next great civil rights
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., said many parts of American society
have been left out of what he called the ``phenomenal'' growth of
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure that when the free market fails to
service a group of people that they are not forgotten and left
without the same opportunities as everyone else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Commerce Department study released last week showed that black
and Hispanic families were less than half as likely as non-Hispanic
whites to explore the Internet from home, work or school.
</P>
<P>
   The study, the third and most comprehensive to be conducted by
the Commerce Department over the last three years, reinforced the
fear that minority-group members are increasingly at a disadvantage
in competing for the hottest entry-level jobs in the nation, which
require a knowledge of computers and comfort in using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Among the study's findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ College graduates are nearly three times as likely to use the
Internet as high-school dropouts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Households with incomes of $75,000 or higher are more than 20
times as likely to use the Internet than those of the lowest income
levels, less than $15,000, and more than nine times as likely to
have a computer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nearly one-third of non-Hispanic white households had Internet
access in 1998, compared to 12 percent of black households and 13
percent of Hispanic households. Thirty-six percent of
Asian-American households had Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   _ Except for those with incomes of $75,000 or more, people
living in rural areas are 50 percent less likely to be connected to
the Internet than people in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary William M. Daley told the caucus that the
federal government could help lower the nation's ``digital divide''
by investing in community computer training centers to make
technology more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   He added that all schools and libraries should provide Internet
access to ensure that every person has the opportunity to go
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that education and access are the keys to getting
people to use the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller, whose state ranked 48th in Internet use, said he
would push Congress to fund programs that shrink the digital
divide. He added that Congress and the Clinton administration
should begin implementing these programs immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to wait five years to do something and watch
West Virginia fall so far behind it can't catch up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frist, whose state ranked 42nd in Internet use, agreed, saying
``minorities and people living in rural areas need help immediately
to compete in the information age.''

 NEW YORK: 15 bags.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Luxury labels like Givenchy, Gucci and Chanel have long looked
to logo-bearing accessories for the bulk of their sales. A $600
Gucci bag costs a fraction of a $3,000 designer outfit. Clothing
sells a house's image on the runway and in glossy advertising, but
it's the more affordable accessories (and perfume) that ring up
profits. ``You get the name out there, like Gucci, but the image is
the bag,'' Ms. Steele said. ``It is a hot object that everyone will
covet.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Sheik, a Gucci spokeswoman, said that bags, wallets and
other leather goods (excluding shoes) accounted for 43.9 percent of
Gucci's $1 billion in sales in 1998. The slice for apparel, 12.1
percent, was much smaller.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, traditional fashion houses have
reinvented themselves by hiring hip young designers _ Tom Ford at
Gucci, John Galliano at Dior, Marc Jacobs at Louis Vuitton _ and
their accessories, in turn, have acquired a new cachet. In January
1997, after Galliano showed his first Dior collection, sales of the
Lady Dior bag _ quilted and adorned with the house's jangling, gilt
letters _ increased 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a clubbiness to bag ownership,'' said Josh Patner, a
partner in the New York clothing label Tuleh. ``Who are you? A
Fendi girl? A Kate Spade girl? The bag says everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Charting the history of status bags, Ms. Steele identified the
Chanel quilted, gilt-chain purse, first created by Coco Chanel in
1955, as the pre-eminent signifier of luxury in the early 1980s. In
1985, Prada supplanted Chanel when it introduced its now-legendary
black nylon backpack. ``It revolutionized everything,'' Ms. Steele
said. ``It became the iconic thing that made all other handbags
seem dowdy. It made you look automatically young and hip, like blue
jeans in the '60s. It had a non-fashiony appeal. It drew on
military and sporting prototypes. It was small, stripped down, sexy
and made of high-tech materials.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is the Fendi baguette, the artful little shoulder bag
bedazzled with everything from sequins to mother-of-pearl and so
named because it can be carried under the arm like a loaf of French
bread, that is credited with the current bag mania. ``Fendi started
the buying-a-bag-a-day habit, having the pink one, the mirrored
one,'' Ms. Kessler of Vogue said. ``There are about 300 bags. It's
impossible to choose, so you want more than one.''
</P>
<P>
   Fendiphiles like Ms. Donahue describe their habit in the
language of 12-steppers. ``Fendi is a sickness, an addiction,'' she
admitted feebly. ``I feel like I need AA for bags, and my husband
is my enabler. He doesn't stop me.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall of 1997, when the baguette was introduced, there
have been 500 variations, ranging from a $475 black nylon bag to a
$12,000 hand-loomed version of which only a handful were made. Once
a design has been fabricated, it is never repeated, imparting to
the baguettes the status of collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   The hype surrounding the Fendi baguette began after the company
held a legendary sample sale in December 1997. The bags had yet to
take off, and the company offered them to fashion insiders,
including many magazine editors, for the staggeringly low price of
$50 apiece, $100 for the fur variety, with no limit on how many
could be bought. Not long after, during the European fashion
collections in March 1998, legions of fashion editors, who showed
up with their cheaply acquired baguettes, were widely photographed,
and a trend was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the cleverest sample sale in terms of the timing,''
recalled Sally Singer, fashion director of New York magazine, who
will become fashion news director of Vogue next month. ``That's how
Fendi primed the market to make their bags and logo impossibly
chic.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, handbag chic has broadened and deepened to encompass many
labels, including less expensive and unfamiliar ones. Young handbag
designers with a whimsical touch are thriving in the current
climate. At Intermix, the Upper East Side and downtown stores,
beaded, embroidered pashmina shoulder bags by Mandala are in high
demand at $250. In the last month and a half, the stores have sold
100 bags. Jane Burley, a designer for Buzz by Jane Fox, whose
canvas bags are decorated with an embroidered bumblebee and sell at
Barneys for $160 to $200, said: ``People are buying the bigger
brands. But they're also seeking out smaller brands to be more
individual. To have a bag that isn't Gucci or Fendi is also
happening right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambertson Truex, a handbag line started in March 1998 by
Richard Lambertson and John Truex, ranging from $335 for a wool
felt bag to $6,000 for an alligator design, grossed $1.2 million in
its first year, and the company has already earned close to that
from fall orders alone. At Bergdorf Goodman, one of the 42 stores
where the collection is available, the latest totes in animal
prints are sold out, and there is a two-month waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion designer John Bartlett, who carries a Lambertson
Truex briefcase, explained why the line has taken off. ``In
America, there's not too many people doing what they're doing,
which is to bridge American simplicity with Italian
craftsmanship,'' he said. ``They bring new meaning to the idea of
American luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   The unavailability of a bag sometimes makes it even more
coveted. When Marc Jacobs designed his first runway collection for
Louis Vuitton for fall 1998, he created a snappy line of
accessories in patent leather, in a youthful palette of baby blue
and beige, bearing the famous logo.
</P>
<P>
   But the bags were at first only available in Paris and London.
It drove some American women crazy. They clamored to get on a
waiting list. Even today, when the bags are easier to come by,
there is an average of 100 people waiting for a phone call saying
the latest model has arrived, a company spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure exclusivity and heighten the buzz, designer bags may
be released in limited editions or they may be named after fashion
icons, like Tod's Lady Di tote or Gucci's Jackie bag (inspired by
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who carried an earlier version of the
single-strap shoulder bag in the '60s.)
</P>
<P>
   Gucci's Jackie bag is so popular _ more than 30,000 have been
sold worldwide since it was reintroduced in October 1998 _ that in
January, when the flagship store in New York held a spring trunk
show introducing a new turquoise Jackie bag, a customer wanted his
girlfriend to be the first woman in the city to have it. He offered
to pay three times the price of $575. But the bag was a sample, so
the store declined. Naturally, the customer was put on a waiting
list.

A NIGHT OUT WITH OLIVER PLATT

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 18)  
 (af)  
 By LINDA LEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Look out, it leaks,'' Oliver Platt warned his
companions as his 1985 Jeep Wagoneer went through the pulsing jets
of the Broadway-Houston Car Wash in downtown Manhattan. On July 7,
the night before, Platt had been chatting with David Letterman
about his part as a pompous crocodile expert in the horror spoof
``Lake Placid.''
</P>
<P>
   On this night, looking somewhat more disheveled, he was escaping
from his East Village household to run errands before the family's
drive to Maine the next day.
</P>
<P>
   With him was his best friend, the screenwriter David Schwab (as
in the Schwab drugstore Schwabs). The two men are the kind of
buddies who finish each other's burgers.
</P>
<P>
   First order of business: getting the Jeep (120,000 miles on the
odometer) through the carwash in one piece. The experience was as
wet and rollicking as a theme-park ride. The Jeep, which Platt
bought used after filming ``Indecent Proposal,'' and had modified
by ripping off the fake wood paneling, emerged from the wash a
surprising, gleaming black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy drives the stuff car,'' Platt said, ``where you carry
the stuff, maybe one kid.'' Everyone else _ the nanny; his wife,
Camilla; his children, 5, 2{ and 6 months _ would ride to Maine,
where they would spend the rest of the summer, in the family car.
</P>
<P>
   Walking down University Place, the men hashed over Tom Junod's
chat with Nicole Kidman (in bed) in Esquire. This led to the theme
of bad behavior. Platt, perhaps best known for his role as the
cocaine-sniffing political aide to Warren Beatty in the movie
``Bullworth,'' confessed, ``I was thrown out of three schools in
the ninth grade in Japan.'' (Platt's father was a career diplomat.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to 12 schools before I graduated from high school,'' he
said. In ninth grade he bottomed out. The offense: smoking
marijuana. Eventually, he found his way at a progressive boarding
school in Colorado, and earned a degree in theater arts from Tufts
University.
</P>
<P>
   Off to Metro Drugs, where the Rabelaisian Platt said he needed
``beauty products'' for himself. Though a casual observer might
have said he could use a lot of them, all he got was a Citre-Shine
shampoo. Then he launched into the children's aisle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheesy toys are essential as a last line of defense in a
car,'' Platt said. ``Tattoo You _ that's a good one. Your Robo Man,
your Lipstick Surprise Kit.''
</P>
<P>
   A whole $59.51 later and with the hard work over, the two walked
to the 3 Z Cafe. Schwab was going with the ``famous'' rice pudding.
Platt settled on the barbecued cheeseburger with mushrooms. ``Taste
this,'' Schwab commanded. ``This is the best rice pudding I've ever
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Platt sampled it. ``Taste this barbecued burger,'' Platt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That IS good,'' Schwab said, as he moved in on the remaining
portions. Platt, who was raised the middle of three sons, looked
prepared to protect his food with sharp cutlery. He shared the
secret of making a horror film in which you spend a lot of time in
the water in British Columbia ``looking'' for a crocodile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neoprene bodysuit,'' he said. ``It traps the air and makes you
buoyant.'' Almost as if he were a crocodile himself. &QL;

SUMMER TIME AND THE HYPE IS HOPPING  
(DW)

   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bathed in the glow of a giant television screen in the Virgin
Megastore at Union Square, a couple stood watching Madonna's latest
video, ``Beautiful Stranger,'' last week. As the ever-trendy singer
cavorted with a snaggle-toothed 60s throwback in a velvet suit and
ruffled shirt, one turned to the other and said, ``This is that
Austin Shag guy or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow these two Megastore shoppers missed the mega-blitz
surrounding ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' _ the Virgin
Atlantic billboards and bus shelter ads, the collectible action
figures, the box office boasting (it toppled ``Star Wars: The
Phantom Menace'' in its opening weekend), and this Madonna song,
the first single from the movie's soundtrack. This oblivious couple
apparently had never used the word ``shagadelic'' in their lives.
What rock had they been under, I wondered. More important, is there
room under that rock for me?
</P>
<P>
   This summer, hype _ the marketing of popular culture _ has
reached a fever pitch. ``Star Wars,'' Ricky Martin, ``Eyes Wide
Shut'' _ there has been a next-big-thing every week, and often a
Time magazine cover to ballyhoo it. Whether camping out for
science-fiction movie tickets, screaming behind police barricades
as a Latin singer dazzles a ``Today'' show audience, or waiting
with baited breath for a glimpse of a Hollywood power couple in the
buff, we are in the middle of ``mania mania.'' It is a cultural
frenzy leading up to New Year's Eve 1999, the party to end all,
perhaps literally if Y2K horror stories are to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   It's all too exciting.
</P>
<P>
   The upside of all this enthusiasm, of course, is that there's
always somewhere fabulous to be these days: Cher's sold-out concert
at Madison Square Garden last week, Bruce Springsteen's 15-night
stand at the Meadowlands, Bette Midler's millennial blowout at the
Mandalay Bay hotel on Dec. 31 in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, there are corn-flavored ice creams to eat and ginger
cosmopolitans to drink, and new boutiques in uncharted parts of
14th Street to plunder. There's always a hot new movie to line up
for: ``Tarzan,'' ``Big Daddy,'' ``Wild, Wild West,'' ``American
Pie,'' and whatever opened biggest this weekend. Everything is a
blockbuster, so why wait until it's at Blockbuster?
</P>
<P>
   Go, go, go!
</P>
<P>
   But all this activity, and the accompanying pressure to have a
good time, is exhausting. In the rush to be part of the moment that
marketers have told us is going on _ to be there, see it all, and
buy the T-shirt _ we end up smothered. Anything good _ Cher's
comeback album, Martin's gyrating hips, Mike Myer's randy superspy
_ becomes so ubiquitous, we end up hating it in a week. Never
before has the jump from ``in'' list to ``out'' list been so swift.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers and twenty-somethings _ advertisers' demographic
darlings _ can ride every breaking wave and shout one giant
collective ``Next!'' They have the energy to keep craving the new.
The rest of us, however, feel the need to retreat to the relative
calm of old records and old movies. Who needs Missy Elliot when you
can have Petula Clark?
</P>
<P>
   Why run out to the new ``Haunting'' when you can watch the
original on Turner Classic Movies? At the flea market or on Ebay,
longtime collectors like myself are asking, ``What can I collect
that everyone else doesn't?''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a glut of mass promotion and mass consumption,
personal taste becomes the lifesaver, but it's harder and harder to
chart your own course. At a time when hype has taken the fun out of
discovering something for yourself and then slowly watching it
catch on, the question has become where is the least hip place to
be? A friend, a French-born restaurateur, has found an answer. He
spends his weekends in a house on a lake in an unappreciated town
in that least fashionable of states, New Jersey. It is the
anti-Hamptons, the anti-Fire Island, he says, and that is precisely
why he bought a place there. He doesn't have to dress before going
to the supermarket because he never runs into anyone he knows.
Manhattanites don't beat a path to his door because the only buzz
is from the bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on his patio, away from it all, one can reminisce about
the days when hype caught up with a performer or a movie or a place
only after you were already bored with it, a time when you had
something to yourself for a while. Those were the days, baby.

DAUGHTERS OF AMERICAN EVOLUTION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 18) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE WILLENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I distinctly remember being 11 and preparing for Come As You
Wish You Were Day at school. In baggy jeans and a boy's flannel
checked shirt and with my face strategically smudged, I proudly
announced that I was Scout of ``To Kill a Mockingbird.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, my 11-year-old daughter had a similar experience,
only for her Come as Your Hero Day, she donned tight Capris, black
platform shoes, a tank top and a bra-strap headband. She was, of
course, that great American icon Jennifer Love Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   What concerns me here is not that teen-age films have replaced
literature as the source of youthful inspiration (that's another
story), but rather that neither of our outfits was far removed from
our usual garb. Which brings me to the problem many of us find
ourselves with who are parents of ``tweens'' _ the name some
marketers have coined for youngsters between childhood and
teen-agerdom.
</P>
<P>
   With daughters between the ages of, say, 9 and 12, we are torn
between pride at how our little girls are blossoming and migraines
over how to teach them about the messages they may be sending.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Katherine was so appalled when her 12-year-old emerged
one day _ in tight skirt, high shoes and a tank top showing her
recently arrived cleavage _ that she stood her in front of a
full-length mirror. When the girl still didn't get it, Katherine
tried another approach: cold experience. Sure enough, two blocks
and a dozen catcalls later, her slightly freaked daughter said,
``Mom, I want to go home and change.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask any mother what her earliest mother-daughter battles were
about, and the answer is likely to be, ``Getting dressed.'' Most of
us ultimately accepted that we should save the battles for the
important stuff, hoping that strong wills in girls would benefit
them later, and let the little tykes wear their party shoes to
school.
</P>
<P>
   Still, party shoes at 5 are age-appropriate and hardly pose a
threat to the wearer. Ten- or 11-year-olds dressed as mini versions
of Demi Moore raise the question: When is she too young for Mace?
</P>
<P>
   That these mother-daughter battles should pick up again during
the tween years should not be surprising, especially given today's
children, who seem so eager to skip straight into teen-agerhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``That age group is so difficult and so opinionated,'' said
Russell Helfer, an owner of the Ragg Tattoo stores in Los Angeles,
which clothe actresses like Lacey Chaubert of ``Party of Five'' and
the Olson twins. Happily for tweens _ and unhappily for parents who
would like to see them linger a minute longer in childhood _ the
cultural and consumer landscape is tilting them toward adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Prime-time television is being taken over by teen-age shows. A
world-class female soccer victory becomes, in the end, a freeze
frame of a great body in a sports bra. And just as filmmakers have
more or less given up on making appropriate fare for tweens,
figuring the kids will be dragged along with older siblings, the
fashion industry has, as far as I can see, given up on them as
well.
</P>
<P>
   There are precious few stores that even attempt to cater to
tweens, who are too young for department stores but too sassy for
precious children's boutiques with imported-from-France petticoats
and equally stiff personnel. Even at the Gap there seems to be
little expressly for them, meaning they head to younger or older
aisles _ and guess which wins?
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Ellwell, fashion editor for YM, a magazine that is
supposedly for teen-agers but is devoured by daughters like mine,
said she did not think that tweens had been abandoned by the
apparel industry. ``It's a really important age group because
they're just coming into how they look and dress,'' she said. ``I
think they're viewed as tame versions of 16- to 18-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   I rest my case. The gap between 12 and ``16 to 18'' is not a few
degrees of tameness. Except I can't rest, because I must face the
uphill struggle of shopping with my tween. While I think she's as
cute as a button and potentially maybe even a dish, I prefer not to
see her as a junior version of girls much older and more sexually
aware.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I had to practically wrestle her to the ground recently to
prevent her from buying tube tops (those provocative no-strap,
over-the-head tops) and midriff-baring T-shirts, two items
``everyone else has.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a store like Marsha D.D. in New York City, one of the very
few designed just for tweens and one that I applaud, offers stuff
that often seems a bit too low or too high in the wrong places.
Here one finds bra-strap headbands craved by girls who don't yet
wear a bra, bathing suits cut unusually upward along the sides and
the above-mentioned tops that come in snug and snugger.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Drogin Dayan, the owner, says she is conscious of the
differences between those who are 10 and those who are teen-agers,
and tries to distract the former from items she considers too
risque.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things I will not buy because I feel a
responsibility to the parents as well as the kids,'' she said,
adding that fashions suited to the tween customer are out there, if
retailers bother to look for them. ``I think clothes are being made
with the difference in mind, taking the influence of the older
girls but not quite going over the edge,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing she certainly can't help is the fact that tweens are
wildly different in physical development. Katherine's daughter was
upset when a friend was allowed to wear a tight dress with a sheer
top, while Katherine had rejected the same exact outfit for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This girl, while the same age, is totally undeveloped, while
mine is downright voluptuous,'' Katherine said. Mothers can't win.
Even when we try to stay firm, others often conspire against us. My
friend Susan Korowitz was taken aback when her 10-year-old, Sascha,
received a dress from her aunt with a note reading, ``Here's one
Mom won't buy you.'' (It had spaghetti straps.)
</P>
<P>
   Susan, in fact, didn't mind the dress. She's more dismayed that
the five pairs of overalls that Sascha liked six months ago have
not been touched since a classmate said they were not cool anymore.
Her friend, Sascha tells me, is the most popular in her grade, and
she's into tight jeans these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all into tight everything,'' said Helfer of Ragg
Tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   My young friend Makenna, who is 13, maintains that ``there is a
huge difference in being 12 and 13,'' having been both. ``At my
age, we all try to dress older and sexier than we are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sorry, but as I see it, even the preteen-agers _
encouraged by the magazines they read, the shows and movies they
see and the merchandise before them _ are into dressing older. They
are charmingly oblivious to the sex appeal they may be exuding.
Charming if this were ``Pleasantville.''
</P>
<P>
   Herein lie the dangers for these walking contradictions,
children who simultaneously talk back and cuddle up, hold Elmo in
one hand while tapping into computer chat rooms with the other.
Does someone who just turned 11 really need to know why nubile
little bodies are the wrong kind of turn-on? Or why certain clothes
may be OK in contained situations but not for everyday wear?
</P>
<P>
   Many of us concerned moms share the blame for our precocious
daughters' tastes. My daughter has seen far too many films she
shouldn't have, evidenced by the fact that her walls are covered in
Ben Affleck and Ryan Phillipe. (Mine at that age were full of
Hayley Mills.)
</P>
<P>
   I confess that after keeping her away from ``There's Something
About Mary'' for more than a year, I found her watching it on a
hotel cable service one night and didn't turn it off.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably too late to go back to when tweens were allowed to
be tweens. But I often wish that those with some real clout in the
fashion world would give us a little help. Maybe designers could
exchange some of their labels for those saying ``R,'' ``PG-13'' or
(fat chance) ``PG.''

<P>
   Can I walk on it?'' first-time visitors often ask Robert Esernio
as they stare at his property in Mahopac, N.Y. There's no mistaking
Esernio's lawn. In a development of similar new houses with mostly
burnt, brown lawns lumpy from the excavator's backhoe, his is the
really green, rolling, luxuriant one, the one with mowing lines
like straight brush strokes up and down a fine piece of suede.
</P>
<P>
   The question strikes Esernio as both absurd and entirely
appropriate. ``Of course, they can walk on it,'' he says. ``It's a
lawn.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is more than a lawn. It's as nearly perfect an expanse
of uniformly green turf as one is likely to find outside of
England, and for the last seven years it has been his passion.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a John Deere GT275 sitdown mower with a 48-inch cutting
deck, thatching and aerating attachments and hydrostatic drive (for
easy turns and straight lines), Esernio cuts his lawn seeded with
rye and bluegrass every five days, not once a week. (``It's happier
when it's cut every five days,'' he says.) He keeps it
three-and-a-half inches high.(``Any shorter, and the roots would
burn out,'') In the pool area and around the perimeter, he pushes a
Sears 22-inch hand mower. (``I need the workout.'') He fertilizes
with the Scott four-step program four times a year. (``The most
important thing about lawns is feeding them'').
</P>
<P>
   An accountant with three children, Esernio, 40, has spent
thousands of hours and tens of thousands of dollars _ including a
$3,500 underground sprinkler system _ to recreate, in effect, a
portion of the outfield at Yankee Stadium. ``I like the straight
lines,'' he says. ``I'm a little perfectionist about it. I find
myself turning the tractor around behind trees so as not to wear
out the same areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawns, once again a suburban status symbol, are bigger. As John
Henske, a landscaper in Fairfield, Conn., says, ``To quote a former
employer, `For some guys it's the biggest thing they own.'''
</P>
<P>
   This may not be the case with Esernio, of course, but he's far
from alone in his obsession. In the waning summer evenings of the
millennium, suburban men seem as devoted to their lawns as their
fathers were in the golden age of lawn maintenance, the 1950s, the
era of suburban migration, the crew cut and conformity.
</P>
<P>
   If middle-aged sons today have less time than their fathers did,
they have more money and more lawn and perhaps more hubris. Despite
environmental concern with pesticides and herbicides and a brief
fling with prairies and meadows in the 1980s, many suburban males
want their lawns to look like ballparks and putting greens.
</P>
<P>
   Real lawn guys no longer call their lawn ``lawn,'' of course.
``If you're serious about your lawn, if you're an aficionado of
grass, you refer to it as `turf,''' says Edmund Hollander, a
landscape designer in New York City with clients in the Hamptons
and other suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, Village Hardware, a narrow, 80-year-old store in
Southport, Conn., was stacked to its tin ceiling with bags of Green
Power fertilizer and moss-killing lime. The stack disappeared
quickly. ``Sales were up big time from a few years ago,'' says
Glenn Oesterle, the store's owner. ``Customers are looking for a
better-looking lawn without spending a fortune. Also, a lot of
people have gone back to buying fertilizers in the bag and doing it
themselves because they're displeased with the lawn services.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Garden Association, which has been conducting an
annual survey of homeowners for the Gallup Organization for 20
years, reports a significant increase in home-owner spending on
lawn care products, from $6.5 billion to $8.5 billion between 1993
and 1998. Bruce Butterfield, market research director for the
association, which is based in Burlington, Vt., attributes the
increase to the strong economy, but also to a change in lawn-owner
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are starting to have a little more respect for
their lawns,'' Butterfield says. ``It's a lot like putting your
best face forward in the neighborhood. There's kind of a domino
effect. If your neighbor is using a Scott's four-step program and
your lawn looks like hell, you're going to want to do something,
too.''

Undated: something, too.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Eisenhower era, they called this keeping up with the
Joneses, and something of the same materialism and competitiveness
has returned in a decade of similar prosperity and political
complacency.
</P>
<P>
   The 1980s and 90s have also seen the second coming of suburban
sprawl. The relentless march of American suburbs _ gobbling up
farmland in Pennsylvania, encroaching on forests outside Seattle _
has made sprawl an unlikely campaign issue for Vice President Al
Gore and has no doubt also spurred lawn-product sales. At the Scott
Company, the country's biggest producer of lawn fertilizer, sales
have skyrocketed in three years, from $228 million to $442 million.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Reed, a landscape architect in Cambridge, Mass., traces the
90s resurgence of lawn fixation to the latest wave of migrants from
the cities. ``I've noticed with urban clients that the lawn plays
an important role in their pursuit of a kind of idealized country
living,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Especially for guys who didn't know from lawns growing up. ``On
the old estates out here, the lawn wasn't the focus,'' says Jim
Kiley, who has a degree in turf management and who works for
Whitmores, a landscaping contractor in Amagansett, L.I. ``But the
clients we have now want it to look like springtime year-round.
It's a guy thing. A lot of investment bankers grew up in Brooklyn
and never had a lawn, so it means everything to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitmores sprays fussy clients' lawns with a concentration of
iron two or three days before a party, turning the grass a desired
shade of bluish green.
</P>
<P>
   Where 1950s fathers and 90s sons differ is that many
lawn-obsessed men today seem content to pay others to create turf
perfection for them. When grass is another commodity, fast grass
beats slow grass by a mile. Most guys want lawns now.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Alfredo, a landscaper in Armonk, N.Y., put a 20-man crew to
work hand-laying sod over a seven-acre parcel in Bedford. ``Here's
the problem in our business _ the best lawn is a seeded lawn, but
nobody wants to wait three to four months for the lawn to grow
in,'' Alfredo says. ``What they're buying is a sod farmer's time
and efforts to produce a seeded lawn. Sod is instant lawn.''
</P>
<P>
   During this summer's drought, which landscapers say damaged even
sprinklered lawns and cut into their crews' productivity, Alfredo
has made deliveries of 6,000 gallons of water, at about $1,000 a
tanker load, to a number of customers' lawns.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest Agriculture Department survey, the sale of
farm-raised sod rose almost 70 percent in 1997 over 1992. The
demand may help explain something of a sod shortage this summer at
the Delea &AMP; Sons sod farm in East Northport, N.Y., which sells 400
to 500 acres of sod a year to exterior designers and landscapers in
the Hamptons, as well as to Yankee and Shea stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone wants to pay someone else, even those who can
afford to. For an increasing number of the turf obsessed, no green
is as good as the green you tend yourself. At Home Depot, the mecca
of the do-it-yourselfer, with more than 820 stores nationwide, the
lawn and garden department has seen ``a double-digit increase over
last year,'' says Jerry Shields, the chain's senior public
relations manager. For Home Depot, he says, ``it's probably a
billion-dollar business.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Brooks, 51, a partner in an East Hampton insurance agency,
put himself through college by working on the greens and grass
tennis courts at the Maidstone Club. For 25 years, Brooks has
reseeded and mowed his own quarter-acre lot himself. ``You just
take pride in the property and the look of the property,'' he says.
He adds that he cuts the lawn ``because the phone doesn't ring when
I'm mowing.''
</P>
<P>
   For some men, mowing connects them with childhoods when they
spent summer evenings in the backyard with their fathers. ``I'm
drawn deeper into the lawn with each pass, nearly identical to the
previous,'' writes Warren Schultz in his new book, ``A Man's Turf:
The Perfect Lawn'' (Clarkson Potter, $35). ``I'm working over old
ground. I'm lifted out, transported back to other lawns and the
aura that rises from them. This lawn is thick with memories of
every lawn I've ever cared for. And every lawn is marked with the
footsteps of my father.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, some men would just as soon forget the lawns of
their youth. Christopher Rosow came of age on four acres in the
Greenfield Hill section of Fairfield, Conn. ``My father was more
into not mowing the lawn,'' he recalls. ``He was more interested in
me mowing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 28, Rosow lives in a tiny, 1822 house in Southport Village,
not far from his parents' home, with a 6-by-20-foot yard. He laid
the lawn with sod from Home Depot _ ``I like instant
gratification,'' he says _ which he cuts with a secondhand Scott
reel mower, the acoustic kind of mower that makes a satisfying
clicking sound when you push it. ``It takes maybe 6 minutes to mow
and 10 minutes to trim with the weed whacker,'' Rosow says.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent development and realization is that turf may not
be exclusively a guy thing at all. ``I think women are catching
onto our little secret,'' Schultz says. ``In the course of writing
the book, I talked with women who said, `You know, growing up I
never really got the lawn. But I really like it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Minikes and her husband, Michael, who live in Manhattan
during the week, bought a weekend home on five undeveloped acres in
East Hampton nine years ago. Before Mrs. Minikes knew it, she was
planning lawns, installing a putting green and overseeing their
care. ``I was born in the Bronx,'' she says. ``I didn't know from a
lawn. But the more I got involved, the more I wanted it to be
perfect. I can't help it. My husband loves it, but it's my charge.
So we don't fight over it. We don't discuss it. I tell him what I
want to do, and he rolls his eyes, and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Henske, the Connecticut landscaper, maintains Martha Stewart's
three-acre Turkey Hill property in Westport, which could stand up
to any man's in a turf competition. ``For an unirrigated lawn, it's
as close to perfect as you can get,'' he says. ``She has a bunch of
guys full time, and they do a good job. But what keeps the lawn
from perfection is that there's constant activity and change. There
are footsteps all over the lawn, and she has dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the obsession with lawns seems overwhelmingly a male
prerogative, maybe the next big guy thing after smoking cigars and
swilling martinis. Women already have other outlets for
self-expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was pregnant the first time,'' says Kathy Esernio, the
wife of Bob Esernio, he of the sitdown mower with the 48-inch
cutting deck in Mahopac, ``I remember him coming to me and saying,
`I feel it's almost time for me to start the lawn.'''

TRIAGE STRATEGY FOR A DRY SPELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 18)  
(lh) 
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the whole of June there was less than an inch of rain, and
half of July had passed with little more than an occasional
spiteful mist that encouraged mildew but did nothing to assuage the
thirst of my garden.
</P>
<P>
   Government authorities changed the ``drought watch'' in my
south-central Pennsylvania county to a ``drought warning,'' one
step below the point where the watering of lawns and gardens
becomes a violation of community spirit, if not an outright
violation of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Dry spells are a given for gardeners, even those in climates
where plenty of heaven-sent moisture is the norm. That's why
sprinklers, soaker hoses and watering cans were invented. But every
so often a dry spell extends into a drought _ a prolonged period
without rain, or with only sporadic light showers that barely
settle the dust.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not suffering one this year, rest assured that you
will, sooner or later. Droughts are as inescapable as aphids.
</P>
<P>
   If the drought is severe enough, local authorities will request
_ or demand _water conservation measures, and it's tough to argue
that keeping the Kentucky bluegrass green is a reasonable use of a
scarce resource. Even if the water supply from the tap isn't
threatened, it's difficult to keep up with irrigation chores when
the rainless days stretch into weeks and months.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, it's time to practice triage among the flora. At
my place, where the water comes from a deep well that is losing
pressure steadily as the ground-water table recedes, I've been
applying battlefield priorities for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The first to be cut off from the watering hose were those plants
that are likely to survive without assistance, even if the dry
spell goes on for most of the summer. The Oriental poppies, for
example, are dormant and will rest comfortably under their mulch
without irrigation. Most other perennials with taproots or fleshy
roots _ like baby's breath, liatris and day lilies, and in the
vegetable garden, asparagus and rhubarb _ will also endure without
help.
</P>
<P>
   They will look as if they are dying, of course, because they
will withdraw moisture from their leaves into their roots, turn
yellow or brown and settle into out-of-season dormancy. It's a
survival tactic, and I applaud their resourcefulness. My goal is
not to keep the garden looking lush, which is not possible. It is
to assure the survival of as many plants as possible, so that they
may bloom again next year, when rainfall returns (I hope) to
normal.
</P>
<P>
   The next to lose dibs on the sprinkler were those annuals that
simply require too much water to be kept looking presentable. I'll
keep watering the moisture-loving perennials, like Japanese iris
and monkshood, but the lobelia, sweet alyssum, impatiens and balsam
are goners. I'll mulch the spot where they were growing and, if the
rains return in time, plant fall-blooming chrysanthemums or
marigolds there.
</P>
<P>
   Having left the strong plants to their own devices and bidden
farewell to the weak, I still have to make some decisions about the
plants in the middle. Many of these are in the vegetable garden,
where I will get no harvest unless I supply water to the crops.
</P>
<P>
   Priority goes to plants that are in blossom. If sweet corn in
silk and tassel goes dry for long, the cob will be snaggletoothed
with poorly formed kernels. Beans, tomatoes, and peppers, too, need
water most critically when they are blossoming.
</P>
<P>
   It's better by far to water deeply once a week than to water
frequently for short periods. Shallow watering is a waste of both
time and water. The moisture will barely penetrate the soil
surface, it won't reach the roots and it will evaporate quickly,
doing practically no good at all.
</P>
<P>
   If the dryness goes on, I will wave goodbye to some of the
thirstier vegetables. Lettuce, cucumbers and summer squash are
little more than water molecularly rearranged in the shape of a
vegetable. For the same amount of irrigation water, I would get a
far better return from kale, chard and cabbage. Celery may survive
drought stress, but it would be so stringy that I could use it for
dental floss. Without copious irrigation, eggplant would be seedy
and taste bitter.
</P>
<P>
   Like perennials that sink into dormancy under drought stress,
annuals have some coping mechanisms for dryness and heat. One is to
wilt or cup their foliage, which reduces the amount of water being
transpired from the leaves. Don't be alarmed if the vegetable
plants droop during the day, even after you've watered the garden.
It's a natural reaction. If they don't perk up in the evening, you
should haul out the sprinkler first thing in the morning. Watering
is best done in the morning to avoid wet foliage overnight, which
can invite mildew.
</P>
<P>
   I will water the berries. Blackberries and raspberries will
produce dry, crumbly fruit if not amply supplied with water;
strawberries are now sending out runners and forming the crown buds
that represent next year's crop. Blueberries are shallow-rooted. If
I don't keep their roots moist, I will lose the bushes, and it
takes five or six years to grow a blueberry bush to the point at
which it will produce a decent crop.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other plants that will get a ration of my limited
water supply are newly transplanted trees and shrubs. Established
trees and shrubs are likely to survive, as long as they don't
succumb to some pest or disease problem in their drought-weakened
state.
</P>
<P>
   When it rains again, I will be glad, and I will also keep
watering. An extended dry spell depletes soil moisture to a very
great depth, disrupting the capillary action that brings moisture
up from the subsoil. It can take weeks of steady rain to recover
from prolonged dry spells. They don't occur overnight, and they
aren't cured overnight.

<P>
   Think of travel to exotic places, and you might think of a past
issue of National Geographic magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Think of traveling across the county and National Geographic
would like you to think of National Geographic Trip Planner
Platinum (Windows; about $45 to $50).
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons to consider paying the $49 for the three
CD-ROM package. There are searchable street-level maps for major
U.S. cities. The maps can be printed, as can driving instructions
and itineraries.
</P>
<P>
   The CDs contain more than 100,000 points of interest, as well as
information on 20,000 hotels and restaurants. The establishments
have also been rated by Frommer's Travel Guides.
</P>
<P>
   The program offers more than just road directions and maps.
Users can find scenic and historic tours, as well as driving and
walking tours.
</P>
<P>
   Information is included on hiking trails, campgrounds and park
maps. Many locations have been reviewed by National Geographic
writers and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Video clips of scenery and regional events are also in the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Routes can be selected for fastest route or scenic appeal. The
routing uses the same engine used on MapQuest's popular Internet
site (www.mapquest.com). The million-plus miles of roads includes
every street in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   New to this version is support for global positioning system
receivers. Users who have them can let the CD-ROM graphically track
their latitude, longitude, bearing and speed using the GPS
satellite system.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic Trip Planner Platinum includes information
from the Geographic's extensive library of travel books and
magazines, including: National Geographic Driving Guides to
America; Guide to Scenic Highways and Byways; Guide to America's
Historic Places; Crossing America _ National Geographic's Guide to
the Interstates; National Geographic Road Atlas of the U.S. and
Canada; State Parks of North America; National Parks of North
America; and Guide to National Parks.

   WASHINGTON _ A top Mexican government official on Friday said
accusations made by small oil producers that his country is dumping
oil on U.S. markets are ``irrational and completely unwarranted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices are determined by global conditions,'' said Luis
Tellez, Mexico's energy secretary. ``We don't fix prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Tellez made his comments during a Washington news conference to
discuss a complaint filed two weeks ago against his country by the
small oil producers.
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma-based group, which formed an organization called
Save Domestic Oil, filed a complaint with the federal government
alleging that Mexico, Venezuela, Iraq and Saudi Arabia sold crude
oil at prices below fair market value between March 1998 and March
1999. The complaint also is being backed by the Independent
Petroleum Association, a Washington-based group representing more
than 8,000 independent oil producers.
</P>
<P>
   Such oil producers were hurt by a steep decline in oil prices
last year, causing the loss of an estimated 100,000 jobs. Crude oil
prices reached historically low levels of near $11 per barrel, but
have since recovered to about $20 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Save Domestic Oil has asked the federal government to impose a
tariff of $6.18 per barrel on oil produced by the four countries.
Iraq, which remains a pariah in the international community, is
periodically allowed by the United Nations to sell oil in exchange
for food and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department has until Aug. 9 to determine whether
the complaint made by the small oil producers has merit and can
move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Large oil producers and U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
disagree with the small producers' complaint, saying there is no
evidence that Mexico dumped oil, or sold it at below-market prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``In good times and bad, the price of oil around the world is
dictated by supply and demand,'' said Red Cavaney, president and
chief executive officer of the American Petroleum Institute, a
Washington-based group representing large oil producers.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that last year's low oil prices were caused by the
Asian financial crisis and an unusually warm winter in 1998, which
depressed demand, causing a glut of oil and a drop in prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in our industry has suffered from low prices,''
Cavaney said.
</P>
<P>
   But Harold Hamm, an Enid, Okla., oil producer who organized Save
Domestic Oil, said he believes the Asian financial crisis caused
the four countries to dump oil because their overseas markets dried
up.
</P>
<P>
   Cavaney said the tariff sought by the small producers would
disrupt world oil markets, likely raising oil prices and the prices
U.S. consumers pay for gasoline and heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamm said even if the entire $6 tariff were imposed, it
would only raise gasoline prices by about 15 cents per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gasoline is cheaper than bottled water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson told reporters this week that he would try to resolve
the dispute before the Aug. 9 deadline. If the Commerce Department
were to decide the case has merit, an investigation of the alleged
dumping practices would likely take several months. If Mexico and
the other countries were found to have dumped oil on the United
States, federal authorities could decide to impose penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Tellez, who met with Richardson this week, said Mexico won't
negotiate with the small oil producers or U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sure we have the economic and legal tools to prove we
are not dumping oil,'' Tellez said.
</P>
<P>
   Tellez said Mexico had no interest in selling oil at low prices
because the industry is vital to the continued improvement in the
Mexican economy, which the U.S. helped rescue after the peso
meltdown in late 1994 and early 1995. He said the government
receives 30 percent of its total revenue from oil sales.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, the world's fifth largest oil producer, has already
retaliated against the United States because of the small
producers' complaint by reversing a decision to scrap the 4 percent
tariff on U.S. natural gas imports.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Tellez announced he would lift the tariff July 1, four
years ahead of the timetable established by the North American Free
Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't take the gas tariff out until this is resolved,''
Tellez said.

   ``Look at the Dutch example!''
</P>
<P>
   That phrase has become a kind of mantra, chanted whenever the
advocates of liberalizing drug laws in Europe or the United States
gather.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch, liberalization proponents argue, got it right by
legalizing the public sale, under certain restraints, of cannabis
products in their now-famous coffee shops and by adopting a much
more lenient policy toward all forms of drug use and abuse based on
a philosophy of ``harm reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   But did they? It has been almost a quarter-century since the
Dutch Parliament set Holland's drug policy on a course of its own,
one markedly different from that of the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   How has it affected drug use and addiction in the Netherlands?
What impact has it had on Holland's next-door neighbors, France,
Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom? Do the results really
justify holding the Dutch drug policy up as a model for other
nations to follow? Or are they a warning about the risks of
following the Dutch example?
</P>
<P>
   The revised Dutch drug policy was based on Parliament's 1976
acceptance of the recommendation of a commission headed by Pieter
A.H. Baan, a psychiatrist and expert in rehabilitating drug addicts
who was serving at the time in the Dutch Office of Mental Health.
</P>
<P>
   The Baan Commission's report proposed distinguishing between
so-called List One drugs _ those that present ``an unacceptable
risk (heroin, cocaine and LSD)'' _ and List Two drugs _ cannabis
products, such as hashish and marijuana _ seen as less dangerous
and ``softer.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Parliament depenalized the possession of 30 grams
of marijuana or hashish _ enough, the legislators calculated, to
meet an average smoker's needs for three months. At the same time,
the parliamentarians vowed to continue the fight against both
domestic and international trafficking in the more dangerous List
One drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after accepting the commission's primary recommendation,
Parliament went a step further by authorizing the commercialization
of cannabis products through their open sale in a network of
licensed coffee shops.
</P>
<P>
   Those shops were subject to a number of legal constraints. They
were not allowed to sell more than 30 grams to a customer. No hard
drugs were to be sold on their premises. And they were neither to
advertise, sell to minors nor operate within 500 meters of a
school. Out of respect for Holland's international treaty
obligations, the import, export, production or sale of cannabis
products outside the coffee shops remained illegal.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the Baan Commission report was adopted, Holland had
what was considered a serious heroin addiction problem, albeit one
roughly comparable to that of its European neighbors. The nation
was relatively untroubled by major international drug traffickers,
with the exception of a number of Chinese ``triads'' (gangs) whose
trafficking was pretty much confined to the Dutch marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   How has that situation changed today? First and most revealing,
Holland (in the words of senior customs and police officers in the
United Kingdom, France and Belgium) has become ``the drugs capital
of Western Europe'' _ and not just of those soft drugs depenalized
by the Dutch Parliament, but also of hard drugs such as heroin,
cocaine and now ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Customs and Excise Department figures that 80 percent
of the heroin seized in the United Kingdom either passed through or
was temporarily warehoused in Holland. The Paris police estimate
that 80 percent of the heroin consumed in the French capital comes
from Holland.
</P>
<P>
   The forthcoming 1998 figures for France's Central Office for the
Repression of the Illegal Traffic in Drugs will, one of the
organization's senior officers says, show ``an explosion'' of drugs
coming into France from the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holland has become the place for drug traffickers to work,''
states a senior officer at Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. ``It's
central. You've got guys there who have access to any kind of drug
you want, smugglers who can deliver it for you to Liverpool or
London. And it's an environment which is relatively trouble-free
from a criminal's point of view. It's ideal, and it has become a
magnet for our criminal types.''
</P>
<P>
   As a senior French narcotics officer puts it, ``Holland is
Europe's drug supermarket. Drugs of all kinds are freely available
there. The price is cheap. Your chances of getting caught with them
are minimal, and you can carry them home across our customs-free
borders without a care.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the greatest drug problem facing European youth today
comes from synthetic drugs like ecstasy and amphetamines that have
spread across Europe like a virus since they were first introduced
in Holland in 1987. British police estimate that a million of these
pills are swallowed every weekend in British discos and clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmingly, these synthetic drugs are coming from and being
made in Holland. British customs states that virtually all the
pills seized in the United Kingdom last year were manufactured in
Holland or Belgium. Ninety-eight percent of the amphetamines seized
in France in 1997 came from Holland, as did 73.6 percent of the
ecstasy tablets.
</P>
<P>
   During an official briefing last summer, a senior Dutch police
officer admitted to former Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the U.S.
drug-policy czar, that ``Holland is to synthetic drugs what
Colombia is to cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland's emergence as the drug capital of Europe is not due
solely to the decision by the Dutch government to commercialize the
sale of cannabis products in the nation's now-famous coffee shops.
But many Europeans believe it is the consequence of the tolerant
attitude toward drugs that grew out of that policy. That attitude,
defined by Dutch foes of the policy as the ``coffee-shop
mentality,'' now permeates Holland's criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to do drugs, Holland is the place to do them,''
notes one of France's top drug police officers. ``The light
sentences they hand out (and) the liberal attitude of their judges
has resulted in an explosion in the number of international
trafficking groups operating out of Holland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a drug dealer,'' a senior UK customs officer observes,
``you are less likely to come to the attention of the police in
Holland than you are in any other country in Western Europe. For
our Dutch counterparts to get permission to conduct a surveillance
operation is unbelievably difficult. It is absolutely impossible to
place a bug in a drug dealer's home or office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get arrested with 50 kilos of heroin or cocaine in France or
England, and you'll be sentenced to 20 years to life (and) serve at
least 17 of those years in prisons that are less than welcoming.
Get arrested with the same amount of either drug in Holland, and
the most you'll get is eight years, of which you'll serve only four
in prisons, where you'll be in your own cell, with color TV and a
stereo, and have the right to a conjugal visit twice a month from a
woman who may _ or may not _ be your wife. Is it any wonder then
that the country has become the drug traffickers' preferred working
place?''
</P>
<P>
   But what about the policy's consequences for the Dutch
themselves?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our liberal drug policy has been a failure, but its advocates
are so rooted to their convictions they can't bring themselves to
admit it,'' says Dr. Franz Koopman, director of De Hoop (The Hope)
drug rehabilitation center in Dordecht and an open opponent of the
Dutch policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we banalized cannabis use. We have left our kids with
the idea that it's perfectly all right to smoke it, and from there
it was an easy step for them to move to the notion that it's also
okay to use mind-altering substances like ecstasy. It is that
mentality that is behind the explosion in the use of these
synthetics we've seen in the last three years, and (it) is a grave
peril to this country just as it is to the rest of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Dr. Ernest Bunning of the Ministry of Health, the central
repository of Holland's liberal drug philosophy, largely agrees.
``I would not be proud if we were to be seen by our neighbors as a
narco-state,'' he says. ``We don't want people to come here just to
gawk at the girls in the windows and get stoned. We have a culture
and a history of which we are proud.''
</P>
<P>
   He sighs. ``With drugs we are in the realm of theory. There is
no simple solution to the drug problem. No one nation, not the
U.S., not England, has the answer. But our solution in Holland is
not ideal either.''

   Holland's emergence as the drug capital of Europe is not due
solely to the decision by the Dutch government to commercialize the
sale of cannabis products in the nation's now-famous coffee shops.
But many Europeans believe it is the consequence of the tolerant
attitude toward drugs that grew out of that policy. That attitude,
defined by Dutch foes of the policy as the ``coffee-shop
mentality,'' now permeates Holland's criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to do drugs, Holland is the place to do them,''
notes one of France's top drug police officers. ``The light
sentences they hand out (and) the liberal attitude of their judges
has resulted in an explosion in the number of international
trafficking groups operating out of Holland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a drug dealer,'' a senior UK customs officer observes,
``you are less likely to come to the attention of the police in
Holland than you are in any other country in Western Europe. For
our Dutch counterparts to get permission to conduct a surveillance
operation is unbelievably difficult. It is absolutely impossible to
place a bug in a drug dealer's home or office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get arrested with 50 kilos of heroin or cocaine in France or
England, and you'll be sentenced to 20 years to life (and) serve at
least 17 of those years in prisons that are less than welcoming.
Get arrested with the same amount of either drug in Holland, and
the most you'll get is eight years, of which you'll serve only four
in prisons, where you'll be in your own cell, with color TV and a
stereo, and have the right to a conjugal visit twice a month from a
woman who may _ or may not _ be your wife. Is it any wonder then
that the country has become the drug traffickers' preferred working
place?''
</P>
<P>
   But what about the policy's consequences for the Dutch
themselves?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our liberal drug policy has been a failure, but its advocates
are so rooted to their convictions they can't bring themselves to
admit it,'' says Dr. Franz Koopman, director of De Hoop (The Hope)
drug rehabilitation center in Dordecht and an open opponent of the
Dutch policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we banalized cannabis use. We have left our kids with
the idea that it's perfectly all right to smoke it, and from there
it was an easy step for them to move to the notion that it's also
okay to use mind-altering substances like ecstasy. It is that
mentality that is behind the explosion in the use of these
synthetics we've seen in the last three years, and (it) is a grave
peril to this country just as it is to the rest of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Dr. Ernest Bunning of the Ministry of Health, the central
repository of Holland's liberal drug philosophy, largely agrees.
``I would not be proud if we were to be seen by our neighbors as a
narco-state,'' he says. ``We don't want people to come here just to
gawk at the girls in the windows and get stoned. We have a culture
and a history of which we are proud.''
</P>
<P>
   He sighs. ``With drugs we are in the realm of theory. There is
no simple solution to the drug problem. No one nation, not the
U.S., not England, has the answer. But our solution in Holland is
not ideal either.''

A BALK, WITH ULSTER ACCENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 18, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the endearing traits of emigres is their hankering to
revisit the old country after making it big in America.
</P>
<P>
   Jews go back to Israel, the Italians to Italy, and the Irish go
you-know-where. Between that old Yank can-do attitude and a liberal
dose of the long green, the returning immigrant aspires to making
some kind of improvement on the old sod.
</P>
<P>
   That's endearing. But even more enduring is the temptation of
the people still living on the old sod to say, ``Yep, we'll take
your money, we'll listen to your advice, and then we'll do it the
way we deamn well please, the old way, and please pack your sloppy
American sentimentalism in your suitcase when you leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The tendency of the Irish of Northern Ireland to take our money
_ but not our advice _ is again ascendant in Ulster, where the
peace agreement brokered so painstakingly by a two generations of
American good will just collapsed in a sea of Hibernian hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Little men carrying too heavy a load of history has been
Ireland's curse for centuries. Belfast has the mindset of the
Balkans _ blood obscures all blame for whatever outrage is
perpetrated in the name of redressing another greivance.
</P>
<P>
   All the little steps that had been taken toward peace in the
province have been betrayed by the pygmies of the political
process. We tried to build them up, to pretend they were bigger men
than they really are, treating them to pomp and primacy.
</P>
<P>
   We had them to the White House, we lobbied the Swedes
successfully to give them yet another set of Nobel Peace Prizes, we
dispatched our businessmen and entrepreneurs with investment dough
and new factory orders, we showered them with honorary degrees.
Bill Clinton had them over for so many St. Patrick's Day parties
that the Unionists and Sinn Fein qualified for reduced rates on
their hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   And what happens? At the end of the day, David Trimble and Gerry
Adams don't deliver. Trimble is no real leader, but a hollow front
man, a herd-follower, mouthpiece for the common herd of Ulster
refuseniks whose ultimate answer is ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   And Adams is the frontman for Sinn Fein, but never was the top
man. A bearded poet, a talker, a seizer of microphones and peddler
of soundbites, Adams was the trained monkey sent out by the organ
grinder to do his turn for the journalists, who dutifully jotted
down his cryptic crossword puzzle answers, and then tried to
explain them to the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have always been slightly baffled by the Ulster agony,
and all the intricate sophistry spun by men who looked and sounded
like rapscallions of the same tribe, but whose religious and class
prejudices override all the other common bonds of culture,
geography, history, and common sense.
</P>
<P>
   With their Ulster accents, the lilting ending of phrases on that
curious uptick, and their specious insistence on rephrasing every
simple sentence into some tortured anagram of equal parts history
and histrionics, the political tunesmiths of Northern Ireland could
not overcome their pettiness. Small men never can.
</P>
<P>
   They'll never call Trimble ``the big fella,'' as the Republicans
called Michael Collins. Trimble is an empty suit, no matter what
sayeth the citation on the Nobel Prize on his mantelpiece. His
opposite number, Adams, is more articulate, a bit quicker on his
feet, but no better a man when it comes to delivering the goods.
</P>
<P>
   The hard men of both sides, the shooters and bombers and
kneecappers, never had a real stake in the peace process. How could
they? These are, in the main, underclass ruffians, small-time thugs
and kneecappers, tailgaters, boozers and dopers and beaters of
women, who lacked anything substantial in the way of education,
training, discipline, or the self-respect of holding down a regular
job.
</P>
<P>
   They were never going to be pounding computer keys or inserting
silicon chips into mother boards, or greeting tourists at the B &AMP; B
with a cheerful hello and a room key. That kind of work is not
their thing. They do the other thing, the dirty work, at night, in
the alley, shooting through lit windows, kidnapping unarmed
civilians, sending unsigned threats, planting bombs to harm the
unsuspecting.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, American politicians who, because of their
Irish heritage or out of sympathy with the effort, worked
unceasingly to help Ulster, Britain, and the Republic of Ireland.
The late Tip O'Neill and Hugh Carey, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and
Ted Kennedy, through the presidencies of Carter, Reagan, Bush, and
most expecially Clinton, the American political establishment bent
to the task of kindling peace in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Helpful moves in Congress were sparked by Chris Dodd of
Connecticut, Joe Moakley and Joe Kennedy of Boston, Peter King of
New York. Trade missions were swapped, grants and loans arranged,
summer camp scholarships and academic exchanges flourished. Kennedy
took Gerry Adams to the Clinton administration, initially through
the back door, and connections were made.
</P>
<P>
   Through the frost of the Thatcher years, the thaw of the Major
years, and the heightened diplomatic offensive of Tony Blair,
successive British governments were encouraged to move Northern
Ireland up the priority list. Then came George Mitchell, Clinton's
deal-closer, to midwife the talks that resulted in the Good Friday
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   To the vast relief of the citizens of both Irelands and the
United Kingdom, the deal was struck, and the principals on the
ground, John Hume and Trimble, shared the Nobel Prize. But the old
enmities rekindled. Decommissioning, the surrender of hidden arms
caches, had been papered over in conciliatory language to get the
deal signed, but no arms were surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   The Unionists balked, the IRA instructed Adams to remain firm,
and entreaties from Clinton and Blair were unavailing. There we
stand. Talks are suspended. We await the first bombing. The
shootings never actually ceased, just diminished. And the midgets
of Ulster still have their shelves of trophies and prizes and
newspaper scrapbooks hailing them as men of peace.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to face hard facts. Trimble and Adams cannot deliver
peace. Both are in thrall to hard men, whose talents are in terror,
not in tradeoffs. It was always going to be a test of leadership,
of finding men who could deliver their hard-liners. No matter the
flowery language of the Nobel Prize speeches, these two took the
prize money, and ran, and failed to deliver in the end.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first thing to remember for American politicians and
business types when the Irish come calling, as they continually do,
looking for handouts. Next time, let's make them swallow some
advice before we fork over the cash and the honorary degrees.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 18)  
 (af)  
 By PETER PASSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The AIV Roadster is a purist's car, meant for one thing:
driving,'' Danny Panoz warned, obviously anxious that a test driver
might write critically about his baby's lack of creature comforts.
</P>
<P>
   The $62,500 Roadster is, indeed, ill-suited for a night at the
opera _ or, for that matter, a trip to the market. It takes some
practice to climb over the door sill and plop into one of the low,
low bucket seats without looking like an idiot.
</P>
<P>
   The vestigial doors are too fragile to use for leverage. And the
seats are too narrow for comfort, unless you have the general
physique of Ally McBeal.
</P>
<P>
   While we're on the subject of convenience, the Roadster has no
room for a glove compartment; the only place to store a map or an
insurance card is the Velcro-fastened door pocket. And then there
are the windows _ or, rather, the lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   The Roadster is designed to be driven without top or windows. A
cloth and plastic contraption, rather like a pup tent, is stored in
a duffel bag in the diminutive trunk and can be used to cover the
occupants in a hailstorm.
</P>
<P>
   The Roadster comes with both air-conditioning and a sound system
with a CD player. But without a roof (or a muffler that can quiet
the engine below a roar) their presence is largely symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, Panoz need not have worried. For anyone who likes
fierce acceleration; quick, precise steering, and the glorious
thunder of a 305-horsepower V8 will love the Panoz Roadster. You
may care less that this car can go from zero to 60 in 4.5 seconds _
faster than an Acura NSX, a BMW M coupe, a Corvette or a Porsche
911 Carrera.
</P>
<P>
   But almost anyone with a pulse will get a kick out of its
appearance, a playful yet polished cross between a 1930s
Mercedes-Benz racer and a 1950s dragstrip bad boy. In my
experience, no vehicle has attracted more oohs and aahs from
attractive members of the opposite sex. Well, maybe the gull-winged
Lamborghini Diablo, which costs almost four times as much.
</P>
<P>
   Up close and personal, there is much more to the Roadster than
an oversized engine and a pretty face. The superrigid chassis is
made largely of aluminum (AIV stands for ``aluminum intensive
vehicle''), a first for an American car.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed stick shift from Borg-Warner is as slick and
precise as the transmission on a BMW. And the engine, a
dual-overhead-cam, 4.6-liter V8 from Ford, with an aluminum block
and 32 valves, is proof that Detroit can still come up with the
right stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The real fun begins when you turn the key. The engine rumbles
(but doesn't vibrate) like a racing machine's. Shove the shifter
into first, ease off the clutch and the car explodes off the line.
Shift to second and before you can blink, the Roadster is howling
at 50 mph near the red line. Amazing what 300 foot-pounds of torque
can do in a vehicle that weighs just 2,570 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The handling, with slightly excessive power steering, requires a
little getting used to. But it never disappoints. In fact the car's
exceptionally wide track, light weight, low center of gravity and
superwide tires on 18-inch wheels create a feeling of omnipotence,
a somewhat dangerous impression that the Roadster can take any
curve at any speed.
</P>
<P>
   The disk brakes, with their oversized vented rotors, are a
proper counterpoint to the explosive acceleration. Thus, while this
delightful beast is probably no match for a 12-cylinder Ferrari at
three-digit speeds, I expect it could hold its own on a mountain
road with any street-legal car in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Beefs? Apart from the limited amenities, just a handful. The car
lacks air bags and antilock brakes, taking purism a step too far.
And the cockpit is so narrow that the only way to hold the wheel
properly is to rest your elbow on the door. This could prove
awkward in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the ledger, the Roadster offers one perk
that is exceptional in a car this exotic: In a pinch, virtually any
Ford dealer can repair the drivetrain. And with proven, durable
parts largely derived from high-end Mustangs, maintenance should be
reasonably cheap. &QL;

JUST THE TWO OF THEM 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL DEAN   The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Letting the heart of Heart shine: That's Ann Wilson's plan for
the first tour featuring just her and sister Nancy Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Heart, of course, was the multiplatinum rock group that put
Seattle on the map in the 1970s and 1980s when Pearl Jam and
Nirvana were still teething guitar picks.
</P>
<P>
   But while Ann and Nancy Wilson, Heart's lead singer and
guitarist respectively, led the group through a 20-plus year career
that boasted 20 hit singles, the two have never toured by
themselves _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   That's a prospect replete with challenges and rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy howdy, yeah, we feel really exposed,'' Wilson said over
the telephone from a Buffalo, N.Y., hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't mean vulnerable to failure. We feel really
confident about it because we've been playing together all of our
lives since we were children, though it is different ... than doing
it in your childhood bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's my natural musical collaborator,'' said Ann, 49, about
her 45-year-old sister. ``And because of that we feel real good out
there together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can talk together between songs in a natural way, and it's
different every night.''
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to a strictly ``unplugged'' or acoustic tour, the
Wilson sisters are drawing on their full range as musicians for the
10-week tour, which runs through the summer.
</P>
<P>
   That means each will play several instruments and take turns
singing lead, although Ann will carry the lion's share of vocals
and Nancy will no doubt do the same on stringed instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 24 instruments, expect Ann to play bass, rhythm
guitar, piano and flute, and Nancy everything from electric and
acoustic guitars to mandolin, dulcimer, dobro, blues harp bass and
piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely plugged in,'' Wilson said. ``But we do play
acoustic guitars on some of the songs, and on some we play
electric.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we have these things called atomic boot boxes. It's
basically a wooden hollow box with pickups inside it and you stomp
on it and it sounds like a kick drum.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're going all over the place with it. It's not really a
folkie thing; it's got a lot of range.''
</P>
<P>
   Songwise, the two will mix new material _ which they will
include on a duo studio album after the tour _ and older Heart
songs, such as ``These Dreams,'' ``Dog and Butterfly'' and
``Barracuda.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with pleasing old and new fans, the mix of songs should
serve as a yardstick between the full-blown band sound of Heart and
the more scaled-down approach of Ann and Nancy Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good metaphor would be food,'' Wilson said. ``With Heart, it
was a great big, rich, heavy duty meat-stew. And with us, I'd say
it's probably more like something Creole. It's spicy, simple and
sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's preference for the sisters' new musical direction
instead of the more rocking Heart hints that the days of the group
may be behind them.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands now, the group is not active. And while Wilson
doesn't completely rule out a full reunion tour, she doesn't
exactly pour fuel on the Heart fire either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like it's a car up on blocks in the back yard,'' Wilson
said about Heart. ``It's not in the junk yard yet. It's being
preserved; waiting for the time to be right to put it back together
and put it on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're not feeling right now like we want to go out and do
one of those funky reunion things.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said ``the money is huge'' for reunion tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fleetwood Mac got so rich off of that one last spin they took,
even though they had to grit their teeth to do it,'' she said.
``And that's not appealing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   What about The Eagles' reunion tour that packed stadiums a few
years ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``They called it `When Hell Freezes Over,' '' Wilson said,
adding with a laugh, ``And hell froze over all right. And it was
really icy.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Uncomfortably hot and humid air will grip the Northeast this
weekend as high pressure over the Atlantic Ocean directs sultry air
into the region. Amid abundant hazy sun, temperatures will soar to
near 100 degrees across portions of southern New England and the
northern Middle Atlantic states. An exception will be near the
south-facing coastlines where gentle sea breezes import
ocean-chilled air to the shore. Farther west, similar conditions
will prevail over the eastern Great Lakes and upper Ohio Valley,
though it will not be as oppressively hot.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms will erupt in the humid air covering the Southeast
Saturday. Storms will be most numerous near the Gulf and Atlantic
coasts where developing sea breezes undercut and lift the damp air.
Another cluster of thunderstorms will be found over southern Texas
as a upper air disturbance spirals inland from the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A corridor of humid air streaming northeastward through the
Plains will fuel showers and thunderstorms across the western Great
Lakes Saturday. Local rainfall amounts of an inch are possible. A
few thunderstorms will also form near a slow-moving front
stretching from the western Dakotas to Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The sun's uneven heating of the undulating terrain of the
southern Rockies will induce spotty thunderstorms Saturday,
particularly in eastern New Mexico. Meanwhile, a cold disturbance
at 20,000 feet will cross the Pacific Northwest, setting the stage
for isolated showers and thunderstorms. The remainder of the far
West will stay mainly sunny and seasonably warm.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Russian Heat
</P>
<P>
   For the second time this month, Moscovites are sweltering
through a heat wave. Just before a midday thundershower, the
temperature reached 86 degrees Fahrenheit on Friday. This was
preceded by a maximum of 90 degrees on Thursday. Earlier this
month, the mercury rose to 93 degrees on July 8 and 9. The normal
high temperature is 72 degrees, a temperate reading for a location
well inland. The routine progression of marine air from the Baltic
Sea usually produces enough clouds to temper the summer warmth in
Moscow. Additional clouds this weekend will help to cool the
Russian capital.

   So what does the nicotine skin patch have to do with wine, golf
champions and, yes, really cool sports cars? Royalties from the
transdermal patch have helped to pay for the Panoz family's
delightfully decadent conglomerate, a host of enterprises that
includes Georgia's only serious winery and the company that builds
a car Parnelli Jones has dubbed ``the great American roadster.''
</P>
<P>
   The story really begins in the backwaters of West Virginia,
where Donald Panoz, the son of an Italian-born professional boxer
was born. By his late 20s Don Panoz, an entrepreneurial sort, had
acquired a couple of drugstores in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1960, with financial backing from friends who played for
the World Series-winning Pittsburgh Pirates, he started Mylan
Laboratories, a pharmaceutical company that would become a power in
the generic drug business.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling the dice again in 1969, he took his wife, four daughters
and son to Ireland to start another drug company, this one
pioneering in transdermal delivery of medications. He struck gold:
The Elan Corp.'s market capitalization is now close to $8 billion;
it was in the news this month after scientists at one of its
subsidiaries said they had developed a potential vaccine for
Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia connection dates from 1981, when Panoz was scouting
locations for a new facility for the drug maker. The ever-restless
entrepreneur decided to combine pleasure with profit, and in the
process managed the nearly impossible: making potable wines from
European varietal grapes grown in the hot, humid hills of the
mid-South.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau Elan's first offerings were marketed in 1985. An art
gallery, hotel, golf courses and conference center followed in
short order on the 3,300-acre site in Braselton, 35 miles north of
Atlanta. Next came a spa and a line of bottled waters (both
projects of Donald's wife, Nancy), along with the Gene Sarazen
World Golf Open.
</P>
<P>
   And what would a great golf course be without a lot of affluent
retirees and weekend duffers camped near the fairways? Building
lots in the Panoz-sponsored development start at $75,000, and
finished houses run $1 million or more _ real money in the Atlanta
market.
</P>
<P>
   Never one to think small, Panoz has since bought 33,000 acres of
undeveloped land near Modesto, Calif., with plans to offer a
similar package of winery, golf and indulgences to San Franciscans
with quality time and money to burn.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the cars: For all his fascination with the
consumables of the good life, Panoz has never admitted any
enthusiasm for fast iron. Indeed, he once told a reporter that he
didn't know how to open the hood of his Lexus.
</P>
<P>
   But his son, Danny, is definitely a gearhead. While working with
the family business in Georgia, he dreamed of building a
high-performance sports car. Others have climbed this mountain
without success, partly because the finished product was too
expensive to sell at a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Panoz planned to make his car both affordable and reliable
by purchasing most components off the shelf from the big auto
makers.
</P>
<P>
   He got his chance in 1989, adopting an innovative chassis design
from a tiny, failed Irish sports-car startup called TMC opening a
modest factory down the road from Chateau Elan. The first vehicle
from Panoz Auto Development, a somewhat austerely finished open-top
roadster that Danny Panoz describes as ``perfect for bikers,''
rolled off the assembly line in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   With an outlandish hot rod-retro body reminiscent of the
all-show, not-much-go Plymouth Prowler, and a monster Ford V8 for
muscle, the Panoz Roadster was bound to turn a few heads. And of
course, it graced the covers of car-buff magazines with lots of
pages to fill each year.
</P>
<P>
   But curiosity quickly morphed into respect, with the early
reviews ranging from encouraging to ecstatic. Car and Driver called
it ``the best street-legal, turn-key, cottage-industry roadster
available in the United States.'' Today, a few dozen Ford dealers
sell a more refined version of that original Panoz Roadster, and
many more can service it, since the drivetrain comes largely from
the Mustang.

   UNDATED: the Mustang. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Danny Panoz started Phase 2 of his operation,
designing a less playful-looking and far more polished ``grand
touring'' sports car with plenty of room for two well-fed Americans
and even a trunk that can handle a couple of sets of golf clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The aluminum-bodied Esperante convertible, with a 320-horsepower
V8 from Ford's Special Vehicles Team; a handcrafted, heavily
leathered interior, and styling cues from Jaguar and a half-dozen
other European sports cars, is set to go on sale later this year
for about $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Esperante will almost match the performance of a
12-cylinder Ferrari, yet cost $200,000 less,'' Danny Panoz
promised. The people in Armani suits from Maranello may not be
losing much sleep over the competitive threat from rural Georgia.
But the auguries are promising.
</P>
<P>
   This story hardly ends here. In 1995, Papa Panoz, who was about
to retire as chairman of his pharmaceutical house, was searching
for another challenge. He decided to plunge into the race car
business with all the enthusiasm, smarts _ and deep pockets _ that
he had brought to Chateau Elan.
</P>
<P>
   Panoz Motorsports hired Adrian Reynard, the racecar designer, to
build a carbon-fiber car, and Jack Rousch, the maven of sports car
engines, to produce the innards for a vehicle that superficially
resembles the Esperante. It added a team of drivers recruited from
racing's top echelons and instantly became a power to reckon with
in the take-no-prisoners world of motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   Panoz race cars hold their own with the best from McLaren,
Ferrari and BMW, placing 7th and 11th at Le Mans last month. And
they are pushing the envelope of racing technology, developing the
first electric-gasoline hybrid car for the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``This much success, this quick, is just amazing,'' said Brock
Yates, an automotive writer whose books include a biorgraphy of
Enzo Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   Does racing make economic sense for the Panoz dynasty? The money
spent on vroom and zoom largely come from multi-millionaires with
too much time on their hands, or from oil, tire, auto and cigarette
companies with mass-market products in need of racing's reflected
glory. Think of Cadillac, now heading back to Le Mans.
</P>
<P>
   The $10 million-plus that Don Panoz admits to spending on his
racing program will no doubt sell a few more Esperantes. ``Building
successful race cars gave our sports cars instant credibility,''
his son said.
</P>
<P>
   But with that kind of money, you could probably convince NASA to
launch an Esperante into orbit. If there is any commercial method
to Panoz's racing madness, it's probably in the sale of tickets
rather than cars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Don Panoz purchased Road Atlanta, an ailing track in
Georgia, and Sebring, the legendary race circuit in Florida. With a
few home-team winners, Panoz Motorsports may yet fill the
bleachers. And who wants to second-guess a man who made a fortune
on the nicotine patch?

MUSINGS ON HISTORY'S TURNING MOMENTS

<P>
   &UR; What if World War I had never happened? What if President John F.?
Kennedy hadn't been shot? There is a growing fascination for such
coulda-shoulda-woulda scenarios, with a handful of books on the
subject coming out this fall. Yet such counterfactual, or virtual,
history, as it is often called, has long interested historians,
writers, filmmakers and others whose curiosity has been provoked by
the suggestion that the world hangs on a triviality.
</P>
<P>
   In ``What If ...?,'' a 1982 collection of historical fictions
edited by Nelson W. Polsby that is now out of print, a handful of
scholars challenge the tendency to take the past (and present) for
granted, imagining what would have happened if, for instance,
Hitler had gotten the atomic bomb, Watergate had not occurred
during the Nixon Presidency. William H. Riker, a political
scientist who died in 1993, speculated that the United States might
never had been created but for a vote cast 212 years ago on Friday.
As Riker explained in his preface:  &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``A look at a map of South America should alert us to the fact
that there was nothing inevitable about the continentwide reach of
the United States. In Latin America a common ethnic heritage among
European colonizers and more or less synchronized revolutions
produced many nations, not one. I suppose there are several turning
points that predisposed the North American colonies of England to
stick together and to expand together. The replacement of the
Articles of Confederation with a Constitution that made it possible
for the colonies to fight a war together was undoubtedly one such
turning point, and perhaps the most important one. And it all
turned on one Massachusetts delegate's vote at the Constitutional
Convention in 1787. But what if Elbridge Gerry had voted `nay'? ''
 &UR; Riker is referring to the votes cast on July 16 by the
Massachusetts delegates Elbridge Gerry _ and Caleb Strong _ for the
Great Compromise, an agreement to give each state equal
representation in one house of the legislature, the United States
Senate. Riker believed that without the compromise, the Convention
would have broken up, and a weak confederation instead of a strong
federal republic would have resulted. Under this arrangement, Riker
predicted that there would be unavoidable military conflicts among
the New World's regional blocs, producing a very different map and
history.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``So this is what North America would have looked like in about
1850. In the far north, all the provinces now part of Canada would
be separate British colonies, gradually attaining a kind of
self-government but never coming together to form the Dominion.
Because the New York-New England War would have destroyed the
United States under the Articles, what is now the United States
would be divided up thus: the Confederacy of New England,
stretching from Boston to the Mississippi, would have claimed what
is now Minnesota, the Dakotas and Montana from the great nation of
Louisiana, as well as what is now Washington and Oregon from
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, at least two territorial wars would have been
possible here. The Middle Atlantic states (aside from Delaware,
which would have been conquered in a brief and bloodless war by
Pennsylvania) would remain independent entities: New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and Maryland. The great nation on the continent would
have become Virginia, consisting of what is now West Virginia and
Kentucky and most of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. Of course, North
Carolina would consist of its original territory (including
Tennessee), and South Carolina-Georgia (including Alabama and
Mississippi) would be another independent entity. The nation of
Florida would have rebelled from Spain; and Louisiana, with control
of the western half of the Mississippi valley, would vie with
Virginia for continental leadership. By 1850 Texas and California
(including western Colorado, Utah and Nevada) would have rebelled
from Mexico and established independent governments. Doubtless
Arizona and New Mexico would remain part of old Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the vastly different political geography, the culture
of the several nations would be quite different. New England and
Pennsylvania would undoubtedly have developed the same kind of
commercial and manufacturing abilities they did in fact develop and
would have benefited in much the same way from the Industrial
Revolution. At the same time the great continental free market
would have been absent, so commercial prosperity would have been
less. The nations of the South, especially South Carolina-Georgia
and Virginia, would be the most prosperous on the continent,
supplying raw materials and food to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Political and cultural achievements would also be different. New
England would have flowered in much the way it did with Emerson and
Longfellow. But New England would be a rather lesser place than it
actually became so that the typical American poets would be Lanier
and Poe rather than Longfellow and Whittier. The controversy over
slavery would, of course, never have arisen, and the peculiar
institutions of Virginia and the Carolinas would have been
preserved well into the 20th century with the Carolinas playing on
the American continent something of the role that the [former)
Union of South Africa plays in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant difference from what actually occurred,
however, would be in the role of America in the world. Instead of
being the example of liberal democracy copied in Britain, France,
Germany and Scandinavia, America would be merely a set of nations,
some successful, some not. While all of them would have some
version of a republic, all would in fact be rather more oligarchic
in tone. Whether liberal democracy would have spread through Europe
in the absence of the American example, I cannot say. But I know
for certain that the relatively smaller and weaker American nations
would not have been able to participate in European wars. Doubtless
what is now called the First World War _ but which would have been
called the Second Franco-Prussian War _ would, without American
intervention, have resulted in the triumph of the German, Austrian
and Turkish empires. These would have carved up among themselves
most of European Russia and the French and British colonies. There
would, of course, have been no occasion for Hitler and the Second
World War, but there would have been other kinds of desperate
warfare, mostly on a smaller scale, in Europe, Africa and the Near
East, as well as numerous balkanesque wars on the North American
continent.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of the United States, with a less grand civilization
in North America and about as much American influence in the world
as now emanates from Latin America, would make the world a very
different place from what it actually has become.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, the actions of Messrs. Gerry and Strong were a
necessary condition of events of great consequence. While these men
doubtless acted out of a genuine patriotic concern for the American
Union, their actions were, at least in the case of Gerry,
irrational and bizarre. Gerry was one of the few men in the
convention who truly favored a far more decentralized government
than the Constitution provided; hence he refused to sign the
document and went home to campaign against its ratification. That
such an opponent of centralization saved the convention to do its
federalizing work is, to say the least, unexpected and can only be
attributed to his failure to understand what he was doing.
According to Oliver Ellsworth, most of the Convention members
regarded Gerry as a pompous fool, as a rich man's son who bought
his influence but didn't know what to do with it, as a pretentious
speaker full of portentous hems and haws who drove everybody in the
convention to distraction, as, in short, a perfect klutz. But then,
the klutz has a role in history just like everyone else.''

REPUBLICANS WALK TIGHTROPE IN DEBATE OVER PATIENTS' RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Southern Exposure is the weekly political notebook from the
Washington Bureau of the New York Times Regional Newspapers) (lh) 
 By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 NYT Regional Newspapers  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With their eyes on the 2000 elections, Republicans
treaded oh-so-carefully as the Senate adopted a patients' bill of
rights over Democratic complaints that it fell short of providing
consumers needed protection.
</P>
<P>
   While they are leery of offering sweeping government guarantees
for health care, Republicans don't want to appear indifferent to
the plight of Americans who can't get the medical help they need
because of cost-cutting restrictions in their managed-care plans.
Polls show health care is a chief concern for many Americans, and
it could be a potent political issue in the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
   So Republicans pushed through a measure that makes it easier for
patients in HMOs to get needed medical treatment. But they rejected
broader Democratic proposals that would have granted patients
greater access to health care and expanded their ability to sue for
malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do is try to improve it incrementally,'' said
Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Republicans approved an amendment that makes it
easier for women to stay in the hospital after a mastectomy. But
they voted down a Democratic proposal that would have made it
easier for patients to see medical specialists. And many parts of
the Republican plan exclude people who buy insurance on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argued that the more comprehensive Democratic bill
would amount to government meddling, inflate medical costs and
result in more lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients should be receiving treatment in their doctors'
offices, not waiting for their case to be heard by a judge in
court,'' said Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., signaled the political fight to
come as he passed judgment on the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insurance companies have won, and American families have
lost,'' said Edwards. ``It's like passing a law against stealing
but not having a police force or court system to enforce it.''
</P>
<P>
   A NEW CHOICE?
</P>
<P>
   Trying a new tack on the abortion debate, Republicans are
rallying around a bill that would force family planning clinics to
talk about adoption with pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., believes such clinics too often turn to
abortion in the cases of unwanted pregnancies. ``We want to make
sure these mothers know that adoption is an option,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Adoption Awareness Act of 1999 would create a new $7 million
grant program to train health care workers on adoption counseling.
</P>
<P>
   While DeMint is a staunch anti-abortion vote in the House, his
bill won the support of the group Republicans For Choice, which
supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   MILKING THE ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   Southern lawmakers are solidly behind a proposal to aid
struggling dairy farmers in the region by forming a new dairy
compact.
</P>
<P>
   Under a measure that could hit the Senate floor in the next few
days, Southern states would be allowed to band together and
establish a regional commission that would set a floor for milk
prices now determined nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy farmers say the compact would lessen the volatility in the
milk market, eliminating drastic price swings that are putting
dairymen out of business. North Carolina, for instance, has lost a
whopping 4,500 dairy farms over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't slow this rate of decline, consumers will see
their local supply of fresh milk dry up, and we will be forced to
rely solely on milk being shipped in from other regions of the
country,'' warned Jim Graham, North Carolina's agriculture
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The compact is opposed by Upper Midwest dairy farmers, who hope
to retain dominance in the milk market. Southern states eligible
for membership in the compact include the Carolinas, Alabama and
Louisiana. Florida must still pass enabling legislation at the
state level.
</P>
<P>
   PARTY POOPER
</P>
<P>
   A Republican U.S. senator running for president abandons his own
party and denounces its platform as ``not worth the paper it is
written on'' in a scathing speech on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   What do his GOP colleagues have to say? Not much.
</P>
<P>
   The defection of Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire from the GOP to
the Independence Party drew barely a yawn on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's his decision,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby, who grabbed
headlines in 1994 when he left the Democratic Party to join the GOP
it they won control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Smith blasted his party as more concerned with ``winning
elections'' than fighting for principles, saying Republicans
candidates are wishy-washy when it comes to fighting gun control or
opposing abortion.

`MORE TEARS': THE PAYOFF IS WORTH YOUR EFFORT

<P>
   ``The truth doesn't have to be accurate,'' says George Findlay.
He should know. As a television news producer with nary a crumb of
ethics, professional or personal, George manipulates the truth
whenever he can.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately George is a fictional character. But he raises
disturbing questions about the meaning of reality in this
media-soaked age. And he does so while offering a chillingly
fascinating tour of his own empty soul.
</P>
<P>
   Actually (to the extent that anything is actual), the questions
are raised and the tour is conducted by George's creator and alter
ego, Ken Finkleman. Finkleman, who introduced George in the
Canadian Broadcasting Corp. series ``The Newsroom,'' brings him
back in a darker CBC satire, ``More Tears,'' which Channel 13 in
New York is showing Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who relished ``The Newsroom,'' which Channel 13 is
rerunning on Sunday nights beginning July 25, may find the
three-hour ``More Tears'' a marathon. While ``The Newsroom,'' a
kind of northern cousin to ABC's fine ``Sports Night,'' was a
series of wry half-hour dramas about the team that puts together a
nightly news program, this is a different animal. Three half-hour
stories build to a 90-minute television film about the making of a
television film in which reality is dissected, reassembled and then
hurled out the window so it lands kersplat at George's feet. And
yours.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff is worth your effort. But this project might be
better appreciated in two sittings. Think of this as an opportunity
to use the VCR.
</P>
<P>
   Finkleman _ the show's writer, director and star _ really has
taken George out of ``The Newsroom.'' He is now a roving news
producer, pursuing the most inanely viewer-friendly drivel with a
vacuous reporter named Diane (Leah Pinsent) and a camera crew.
</P>
<P>
   When first glimpsed, they have gone to a remote farm as part of
a media swarm chasing the tale of a baby girl trapped in a well.
George carefully coaches the willing local politicians and the
girl's compliant young mother about just what to say on camera.
Then the videotape rolls as Diane smarmily asks the mother how she
feels and tells her: ``You're a symbol. Do you know that?'' A
symbol of what? You'll find out.
</P>
<P>
   The on-air blather from Diane and the other television reporters
on the scene is dead on. And George's priorities are clear. He
barks into his cell phone about the baby, ``All we can do is hope
and pray that she comes up in a decent time slot.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is ever uncomplicated for George, who is pursued as well
as pursuer. He has been followed to the farm by both his glum wife,
Andrea (Arsinee Khanjian), and his longtime girlfriend, Nikki (Lou
Thornton), a frequent failure at stand-up comedy and suicide. They
both know he has others. One, who is met later in the proceedings,
is the most appealing character in the series: a free-spirited
artist, played by Larissa Laskin, who is never addressed by name.
She expects no fidelity, so she is the only person, including
himself, to whom George isn't constantly lying.
</P>
<P>
   The other two half-hours follow George and Diane on their
tabloid-type assignments, while George keeps bumping into women who
are only too glad to offer themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Now that you've learned to love loathing George, you're ready
for the main event, in which he throws off the life of an
incompetent television news producer to become the incompetent
writer-director of a television drama about an incompetent news
producer named George. He has written characters based on Andrea
and Nikki, and he has hired Diane the reporter for the role of the
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really think I can play this part?'' she asks. ``She's a
funny, mindless broad.''
</P>
<P>
   George replies, ``Play yourself, and you'll be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane never guesses she's been insulted. If indeed she has been.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? You will be, as the film within a film within a film
spins out of control. But you will finally learn why the series is
called ``More Tears.'' And you'll have cynical fun watching
George's movie unravel, along with his love life and possibly his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   When the actor playing the actor who's playing George tells the
auteur that he wants to ``get inside your head,'' George says:
``Well, it's kind of small and messy. And I'm not sure you'd like
the view.''
</P>
<P>
   Things get a bit heavy at the end. But by the time Finkleman
gives you your own mind back, you'll thank him for shaking it up.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward you may refuse to believe anything you haven't seen
for yourself. Doubt that? Well, see for yourself.

ELDER SWEAT HAS HEALING PROPERTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.J.)   (For release Monday, July 19)  
(js) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've been feeling blue, despondent or just generally in a
bad mood, the cure could be to thrust your nose into the armpit of
an elderly woman.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Monell Chemical Senses Center in Pennsylvania and
Rutgers University in New Jersey believe the body odors of older
people, particularly women, can put others in a happy mood.
</P>
<P>
   The scent, which the researchers called ``l'eau de grandmere,''
could explain the warm, reassuring feeling that elderly women and
grandmothers seem to convey.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Reuters story, scientists tested their theory by
collecting underarm odors on gauze pads from 30 volunteers ranging
from toddlers to 70-somethings and asked more than 300 students to
assess their mood before and after sniffing the samples. (Another
good reason not to volunteer for anything.)
</P>
<P>
   Smells from older people and females in general produced a more
positive mood. Baby odors did not improve moods, and scents from
young men and boys were associated with aggression.
</P>
<P>
   Call me crass and insensitive, but I see a great financial
opportunity here for Florida's huge population of elderly women.
Instead of just sitting around waiting for their next Social
Security check and complaining about the high price of prune juice,
Florida's grannies can get rich selling their sweat.
</P>
<P>
   This being summer, we are in the peak of the ``season,'' so to
speak, which means that your average granny could produce several
quarts a day of high-quality, euphoria-inducing perspiration simply
by performing a little light outdoor exercise such as laying a few
acres of sod or tarring a roof.
</P>
<P>
   For a small piece of the action, say 25 percent, I would gladly
permit a few enterprising grannies onto my property, where they can
work toward financial independence by weeding my garden and digging
post holes for my new fence.
</P>
<P>
   The nice thing is, if I start to feel sad or guilty watching
them do all that work, I can just plunge my face into one of their
armpits and become instantly dizzy with happiness and well-being.
</P>
<P>
   (Of course, I would have to take care not to plunge so
vigorously that I break a sweat as the grannies might get a whiff
of it and start fighting among themselves or, even worse, with me.)
</P>
<P>
   I see a day in the not-too-distant future when Florida's elderly
women become a tourist attraction every bit as big as our white,
sandy beaches and world-class array of speed bumps. Tourists from
Ontario will gladly pay $5 ($10 Canadian) just to sit for a few
minutes in an un-air-conditioned room with an 80-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
   There are some risks in all this, of course. Kidnappings or, in
this case, granny-nappings, would surely increase once the world
became aware of the restorative qualities of geriatric
perspiration. Females over the age of 70 might need bodyguards
every time they venture out into public or else they could try
disguising themselves as young men. There would also, undoubtedly,
be an increase in broken clavicles caused by scent-crazed
individuals ramming headfirst into elderly women's armpits. To
protect themselves, Florida's grannies may want to familiarize
themselves with a few basic karate moves or else invest in a set of
high-quality shoulder pads.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be long, surely, before a factory begins churning
out the first bottles of ``l'eau de grandmere'' perfume, not to
mention the related line of colognes, bath oils, scented talcs and
air fresheners. The term ``sweatshop'' will take on a new and even
grimmer meaning on the day the Herald-Tribune breaks the story of a
heartless, greedy industry that collects the drippings off feeble
grandmothers who are forced to stand for hours in the hot sun so
that pleasure-seeking yuppies can get a buzz off their sweat.
</P>
<P>
   It all might turn out to be a wonderful thing for Florida's
grandmas, but if I were a 70-year-old woman, I think I'd be
stocking up on deodorant.

 &HT;    Journal explores growth of plant biotechnology
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday July 18.
 &HT;    By Rachael Kennedy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can't tell by look, smell or taste, but that delicious cob
of corn you're eating may not be the same corn you're used to
eating.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered a thing of science fiction, genetically modified
foods are a growing part of the world's food supply _ even though
many consumers are not sold on their safety or usefulness, new
research shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plant biotechnology is exploding. There are issues with
production; there are a lot of societal questions coming up,'' said
Brooks Hanson, deputy managing editor of the journal Science, which
explored the pros and cons of GMF in a special edition last week.
``We felt it was time to update the state of the science
surrounding the changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings from three articles in Science:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GMF are becoming commonplace. In 1996, 2 million acres
worldwide were planted with transgenic crops. By 1998, that number
had escalated to 67 million acres. Seventy-four percent of those
acres were in the United States. The only other countries with
large croplands planted with GMF were Argentina, with 15 percent of
the world's production, and Canada, with 10 percent. The five
principal crops include soybeans, corn, cotton, rapeseed/canola and
potato, and 1998 sales amounted to $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Plant biotechnology is not only being used to improve the food
supply, by allowing for bigger and faster crop production, but
recent advances have also led to the development of plants that may
be able to safely remove high levels of toxic metals from soil.
Scientists are also investigating ways plants can be modified for
industrial use.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Americans are more open to GMF than Europeans. A 1997 poll of
more than 1,000 U.S. citizens by the London School of Economics
found that 30 percent support GMF, 11 percent oppose GMF and
another 19 percent are uneasy with their use. A separate poll of
16,500 Europeans by the school found 16 percent support GMF, 22
percent oppose and 15 percent are uneasy with their use.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Americans are more opposed to genetic testing on
humans and genetic medicines than bioengineered food sources, the
school found. Researchers also said that Americans are less
scientifically literate than Europeans and expressed greater trust
in the government regulatory bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Iceland banned GMF altogether and Prince Charles and
the European Community publicly called for more regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Other articles in Friday's special edition of Science explore
the ethical debates surrounding GMF, patent issues, the science
behind modification and how developing nations may benefit from
wider use of GMF.

 &HT;    Mummies and mystery at Egyptian art unveiling
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the basement of Emory University's Michael C.
Carlos Museum, an ancient coffin case, its head swathed in towels,
appears to be primping for its debut in the third floor galleries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's aromatherapy,'' kids Kate Singley, a free-lance
conservator.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Singley is trying to shore up the frail surface of the
head so that it can make it through its Atlanta unveiling without
further damage. On Monday, for one day only, the public can see the
mummies, coffin cases, canopic jars (limestone containers for
internal organs) and other objects that the Carlos purchased this
year from a Niagara Falls, Ontario, curiosity museum. A public
campaign helped raise $2 million to buy the 83 objects, some of
which are at least 3,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
   For this much-anticipated first viewing, several objects will
join the permanent collection of Egyptian art on the first floor
for a six-month rotation. The Carlos also has installed _ again,
for Monday only _ a small sampling of the acquired objects on the
third floor, including three coffins, a mummy still in the crate in
which it traveled to the Carlos in May, a bronze falcon and a
mummified cat.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cinderella, these objects will return to the conservation
lab Tuesday for further work. There is much to do before they are
shown in a large temporary exhibition planned for 2001. In addition
to restoration, the objects will be carefully studied.
Conservators, working with Peter Lacovara, Carlos curator of
ancient art, will shine a black light on the coffins and canopic
jars to see if the varnish and paint is old or new. (New paint
fluoresces.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If the paint on the canopic jars is old, then they are very
rare,'' Lacovara says. ``I only know of a few in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston Egyptologist Joyce Haynes will work to decipher the
hieroglyphs. One of her goals is to figure out the identities of
some of the mummies in the coffins. This will help Lacovara to work
out their genealogy. Emory art history professor Gay Robins will
study the painting styles.
</P>
<P>
   The mummies will go through medical hoops _ CAT scans, X-rays
and DNA testing. In an uncanny coincidence, the mummies have ended
up at one of the few places in the world where such DNA testing is
possible _ in the lab of molecular biologist Douglas Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kismet,'' says Lacovara.
</P>
<P>
   Because they suspect that one of the mummies may be Egyptian
royalty, research will require DNA testing on royal mummies in
Egypt as well as contemporary Egyptians. If the remains turn out to
be Ramses I, the Carlos has promised to return him to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   You can be sure of one thing: The Carlos will make every effort
_ in Monday's display and in its 2001 show _ to avoid any of the
ghoulishness or sensationalism that has always been part of mummy
mania.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to display the remains respectfully,'' says Therese
O'Gorman, the Andrew W. Mellon conservator at the Carlos, ``and we
want to use them as a hook to get people to learn more about
ancient art and society.''
</P>
<P>
   First Impression: A Preview of the Collection of Egyptian
Antiquities
</P>
<P>
   11 a.m.-7 p.m. Monday. Suggested donation: $3. Emory
University's Michael C. Carlos Museum, 571 S. Kilgo St. N.E.
404-727-4282. Large crowds are expected. Parking will be available
at Emory West, 1256 Briarcliff Road N.E., formerly the Georgia
Mental Health Institute, where specially designated shuttles will
provide round-trip rides to the museum. Additional parking may be
available at on-campus parking lots, but space is limited.

NOTES FROM THE TV CRITICS TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The flap over the lack of decent roles for
minorities on the big TV networks came up again Friday at a press
briefing on ``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge,'' an HBO film about
the black actress/singer/dancer who enjoyed stardom in the '40s and
'50s but died mysteriously, probably a suicide, when she was 42.
</P>
<P>
   Halle Berry, who has wanted to tell the Dandridge story for
years, stars in the film and also served as an executive producer.
To the NAACP's charge that the networks are racist, Berry said:
``They're not saying anything I don't already know. Living as a
black woman in everyday society, I'm very much aware of the racism
... so it's disheartening.''
</P>
<P>
   But Berry says the racial divide is not unique to TV. ``I still
don't feel there is a space for a (black) leading lady in Hollywood
because now that I've done this amazing role of a lifetime, ... for
the last six months I've not been able to find a project that can
even compare to the role I've just been able to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Berry shows an amazing capacity for patience in the wait
for colorblind casting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't see it in my lifetime, I'm confident that my part
is very important,'' she said. ``I must live out this moment in
time and, later on down the line, whether I'm here to see it or
not, somebody like me and Dorothy will see that brand new shiny
day.''
</P>
<P>
   _Geraldo Rivera says he's a ``high energy'' guy. Besides his
duties as an NBC News correspondent and as host of ``Rivera Live''
and ``Upfront Tonight'' on CNBC, Rivera host has been sailing the
globe in fits and starts since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever his schedule allows, he and his family hop a plane to
wherever it is they last moored their sailboat, Voyager, and sail
it until events warrant a return to TV for the tillerman.
</P>
<P>
   A two-part film of Rivera's circumnavigation, ``Sail to the
Century,'' will air in mid-December and early next year on Travel
Channel, one of the new kids in the Discovery Networks family.
Rivera's goal is to be among the first to ring in the year 2000 at
the International Date Line.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera says his lust for leaving the office has nothing to do
with the fact that some of the luminaries at NBC News weren't
thrilled when he was named a correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never be `one of the guys' over there,'' Rivera
admitted Friday. ``But NBC is big enough that Brokaw and I can
co-exist.'' After some reflection he added: ``Hopefully, in the
future, the Kosovars and the Serbs will get along.''
</P>
<P>
   _Dan Patrick and Chris Berman each had a say in determining
ESPN's greatest athletes of the century, but neither anchor knows
who will be No. 1 at the end of the year. ESPN this week reached
No. 27 (San Francisco 49ers receiver Jerry Rice) in its countdown
of the top 50. It'll reach the top 10 in December, and the top two
will be announced in a two-hour show on ABC Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for their personal picks, Berman said he'd have Babe Ruth
No. 1, followed by Muhammad Ali and Willie Mays. Patrick also likes
Ruth for first place, with Michael Jordan and Jim Thorpe close
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick said the most vocal reaction of viewers is to the
``SportsCentury'' ranking of Secretariat at No. 35. Even athletes
are keeping score. Berman said he saw former hockey star Bobby Orr
last week, and Orr's first comment was: ``Geez, at least I beat the
horse.''

 &HT;    Interest grows in artifacts of slavery
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A large hand-woven seed basket, made either by slaves
or by emancipated African-Americans just after the Civil War, sits
atop an old bookcase in Nathaniel Norman's antiques shop on
Bankhead Highway. He also has an intricately carved mahogany cane,
whittled either in Africa or by African-Americans. And a one-string
musical instrument popular ``in slavery times.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman, 49, is one of the few black antiques dealers in Atlanta,
catering to blacks who no longer consider their ancestors' history
a time to forget. He's not yet a big bug in the flea market
business, but he has become a go-to guy for Atlanta-area
African-Americans who, while abhorring the oppression of their
forebears, nevertheless want to own reminders of slavery and the
Jim Crow era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people are getting interested in collecting because it
gives you a sense of who we are and where we came from,'' Norman
says.
</P>
<P>
   To stock his store, Norman's Antiques and Collectibles, he
employs a legion of ``hunters'' who bring in everything from canes
and old banjos to swords picked up on Civil War battlefields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people don't throw away nothing,'' he says, holding the
seed basket, which he bought from a 97-year-old woman whose
ancestors were slaves. ``And look at this cane. It's definitely
African. My people have stuff everywhere. There are treasures all
over, still hidden.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Thomas Jr., a 47-year-old Atlanta lawyer, collects
anything he can find from slavery times. He owns a deed describing
the sale of a little boy and a little girl, as well as slave
shackles used in the 1830s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than being a source of embarrassment, there's a
tremendous source of pride to see how far we've come as a people,''
says Thomas, who uses the items as props in frequent talks to
school groups. ``To deny history is not good for our community, or
our kids. If we accept it and explain it, it creates a much
healthier environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the shackles makes children ``really sit up,'' Thomas
says. ``They find it a little hard to believe this really
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Browsing in Norman's cluttered store, John Burrison, 56, a
professor of culture at Georgia State University, is immediately
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Gently touching the seed basket, Burrison, who has a permanent
collection of folk art at the Atlanta History Center, says, ``I've
never seen anything like it.'' Then he sees a hand-carved mahogany
cane, which leaves him breathless. ``It's distinctly
African-American,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Growing interest in relics of slave times has created a market
nationally. Shackles can be purchased on the Internet, and one Web
site recently advertised an ``extremely rare female slave collar''
for nearly $9,000.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, slave deeds and bills of sale could be had for as
little as $50, but those days are gone. Today, such items bring
five to 10 times as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this stuff is just now starting to come out,'' says
Norman. ``Some are just now finding it. And a lot have it but don't
know what to do with it.''

 &HT;    From attic to basement, atlantans' homes are full of intriguing
artifacts
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gingerly, Paul Hineman opens a weathered cardboard
box, slowly unfurling a tattered Old Glory, with 38 stars, that he
says draped the coffin of Ulysses S. Grant in 1886.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Brown, manager of Red Baron's Antiques in Sandy Springs
(Ga.), is _ ahem _ more than a tad dubious. One of the South's
premier experts on antiques, he's constantly fending off excited
patrons trying to peddle valueless junk that they think is
priceless.
</P>
<P>
   But this time it's different.
</P>
<P>
   Hineman, 34, offers documentation: yellowed newspaper clips,
family letters and a 1936 Good Housekeeping magazine article about
the flag, which he inherited from his grandmother. Brown studies
the flag and documents, then scribbles out a $7,000 check.
</P>
<P>
   There may no longer be gold in the hills of Dahlonega (Ga.), but
there's definitely a heap of gold in them thar attics, basements
and long-stored cedar chests all around Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, and especially Southerners, are keepers, Brown says.
Which is why, whether you live in a mobile home or a million-dollar
mansion, the odds are that many of your neighbors could show you
relics you'd be hard-pressed to find in a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in historical artifacts has been heightened by eBay, an
Internet auction site, and PBS's popular ``Antiques Road Show.''
They've sent millions of people rummaging through barns, attics and
basements looking for reminders of the past, to sell or to preserve
for themselves. Dealers such as Brown spend lots of time eyeballing
objects for people who want someone to authenticate, or perhaps
buy, interesting items that they've had for decades or picked up at
garage sales.
</P>
<P>
   Take Henry W. Grady III, 37, an investment specialist and the
great-great-grandson of Henry W. Grady, famous for his editorship
of The Atlanta Constitution in the 1880s. The first Henry Grady's
father, Maj. William S. Grady, was a Confederate cavalryman, and
his Tiffany sword has been passed down for five generations.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Grady took the sword to Frank Walsh, co-owner of
Yesteryear Book Shop in Atlanta and a sometime appraiser for the
``Road Show.'' Walsh said it would fetch somewhere between $5,000
and $10,000 at auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was only curiosity,'' says Grady. ``Obviously, I
wouldn't sell at any price.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans to pass the sword down to his three daughters or donate
it to the University of Georgia, his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Grady and Hineman were among several hundred people who
responded to a notice in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution inviting
owners of pre-World I relics to call us. What metro Atlantans told
us they own ran the gamut, from a 15th-century German prayer book
to the diary of former Georgia Gov. Hoke Smith, from a slightly
used 1800s coffin to a teapot from the Great London Exposition of
1851.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just monetary value that drives most people to hold on
to heirlooms or buy historical relics. Many, like Grady, do so for
sentimental reasons, to maintain a connection with the past.
</P>
<P>
   John Crosswell, 77, of Covington still has a July 2, 1863,
edition of the Vicksburg Daily Citizen that he traded ``a no-good,
broken-down bicycle for'' 65 years ago. ``It's a piece of
history,'' he observes.
</P>
<P>
   Brown says the country is full of such relics, though many
aren't as well cared for as Crosswell's Civil War newspaper has
been.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous amount out there,'' Brown says. ``People
die and move on, go from bigger to smaller houses as they age. They
give things to the grandaughter or son or whatever. And they put it
in the basement because people don't realize its value, or it
doesn't fit in with their lives. It's unbelievable, the things you
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people, however, do realize the value. That's why estate
sales often attract lots of potential buyers. Walsh, of Yesteryear
Book Shop, believes that nostalgia is being fueled partly by the
approaching millennium, which makes many baby boomers feel old, as
they realize that many of their childhood toys, such as original
Mickey Mouse hats, are now considered antiques.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in collectibles is so keen that the Atlanta History
Center has scheduled a collectors' day Sept. 18, at which experts
such as Walsh and Brown will examine relics. And on Aug. 5, when
the American Political Items Collectors hold their national
convention in Atlanta, thousands of owners of old political
ribbons, buttons and posters will converge here from around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we move around so much, and as so many Americans are cut
off from neighbors and ordinary friendliness in daily life, we
treasure these objects that help us feel connected,''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Paul Brown, son of the Red Baron's manager, who also works
for the store: ``With the relics we own, we all become portals to
the past, portals which everyone, whether they are aware or not, is
drawn into. Part of the human condition involves, often on a
subconscious level, being a part of something greater than the sum
of its parts.''
</P>
<P>
   One recent morning, Bob Linzey, an executive with the
Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co., proudly showed Walsh a 431-year-old German
prayer book, printed with carved wooden blocks. The antiques expert
was almost at a loss for words.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is marvelous,'' Walsh whispered. ``Look at this date in
Latin, `MDLXVIII' _ 1568. Look, someone has written in the margins.
The covers are made of wood, and it's bound with brass hinges.
Remarkable!''
</P>
<P>
   Linzey wasn't interested in selling, and though Walsh is an
expert on antique books, he was hesitant to put a value on this
one, suggesting that someone at Emory University's Candler School
of Theology should take a look. Linzey got the thick volume,
containing several thousand pages, from a long-dead friend who had
found it in the eaves of a bombed-out house in Germany during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   In the South, Civil War relics are always hot.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they're even too hot to handle, says Brown. ``I've had
people sell muskets that go off _ they didn't know it was loaded.
And artillery shells are still dug up.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman James, 58, of Newnan (GA.) found his Union artillery
shell on his great-grandfather's farm near the site of the 1864
Battle of Kennesaw Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was plowed up back in the '50s,'' he says. ``I keep it in
my closet. This one was a dud, but it still had black powder in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shells and cannonballs can be found in most antiques stores,
says John Sexton, owner of Stone Mountain Relics, and some can be
worth several hundred dollars to museums or collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emotion in those things is important, especially in the
South,'' he says. ``That's one reason Confederate swords can go up
into the tens of thousands of dollars, easily. They're much more
valuable than Union swords, which aren't as rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Kohlhoff's Civil War-era collection includes two
unredeemed Confederate $1,000 bonds _ which, had the Confederacy
endured, would each be worth $2.6 million today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the South ever rises again, I'll be in high cotton,'' jokes
Kohlhoff, 51. He also owns a quilt made by slaves, a first edition
of ``Alice in Wonderland,'' published in 1865, and Confederate
10-cent scrip printed by Mechanics Bank in Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   Even discharge papers from the Civil War era can fetch several
hundred dollars, Kohlhoff adds, and a copy of the parole issued to
the 30,000 men who surrendered at Appomattox with Robert E. Lee is
easily worth $3,000 or more. Even at that price, he adds, ``they
are almost impossible to find,'' because their owners aren't
interested in selling them.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Kasey Walter, 51, of Marietta (GA.) says,
``There's some things you can't put a price on,'' such as her
husband John's collection of 39 letters, eloquently written in 1864
by his great-great-grandfather, Charles Shepard, a Union soldier
who encountered the legendary Confederate unit Mosby's Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He describes raids by Mosby's Raiders, and what's interesting
is, my great-grandfather was in Mosby's Raiders. They probably
fought against each other!''
</P>
<P>
   Many relics that people consider priceless, however, have little
value on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century coffin owned by Harriet Rowland of Forest Park
(GA.) is ``very strange,'' she says. ``It's made of oak with a
cedar lid. At one time there was a body inside. You can still see
bloodstains. I keep it in my barn because there's a ghost that came
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the private-collection spectrum are items
that many museums would love to have, such as a bronze spoon, now
owned by Jessica Simmons, that was once used by a soldier in the
army of Oliver Cromwell, who led a revolution in 17th-century
England. Her grandfather found it while digging in his garden in
Kent, England, in 1953 and had it authenicated by the British
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Or the 1st century A.D. bowls and jars that Joseph Hassell, 78,
of Acworth (GA.) brought home from Turkey in the 1950s and had
authenticated by the Corning Museum of Glass in New York. Says
Hassell: ``I've had them in a shoe box in my closet ever since.''

 &HT;    Shellman's ex-Mayor Sonny Sammons crafts novels as carefully as
he makes furniture
 &HT;    EDS: Embargoed for Sunday, July 18.
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHELLMAN, Ga. _ It is midafternoon in Southwest Georgia, and
former Mayor Sonny Sammons is conducting a tour of the town that is
at the heart of his two novels.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter that half of the brick stores along the
railroad tracks are vacant, and the name on the water tank is
partially obscured by rust.
</P>
<P>
   The town and characters, as they once were, are burned into
Sammons' memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a bowling alley across the road,'' he says,
maneuvering his SUV along the narrow street, ``and there used to be
a service station on the corner. We had two dime stores and a movie
theater. You know the last picture show they showed there?'' He
pauses and grins. ```The Last Picture Show.'''
</P>
<P>
   Driving past a building that used to be a horse-and-mule auction
barn, Sammons recalls his adventures on a runaway horse when he was
6. Nearly every landmark, every house triggers a story about a
person or event from his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these stories are woven into his 1995 autobiographical
first novel, ``The Keepers of Echowah'' (Cherokee, $18.95), the
story of twin brothers growing up on a hunting plantation in South
Georgia. Still more appear in his latest book, ``Then Sings My
Soul'' (Cherokee, $23.95), a novel based on a true story of
domestic abuse and rural justice in the 1940s. The narrator is a
young boy who is raised by his widowed mother and two grandfathers.
When Grandfather Alex's daughter is brutally abused and her husband
is later found shot to death, Alex is sentenced to die in Georgia's
electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really happened to one of my uncles,'' Sammons says,
declining to name him. ``When his daughter was beaten up pretty bad
_ I think her husband broke both her arms _ my uncle went over to
his son-in-law's house and blew his brains out with a shotgun.''
</P>
<P>
   What was amazing, Sammons says, is that the sheriff never locked
him up and allowed him to go back to work on his farm. About three
days before the scheduled execution, the sheriff sent him a ticket
and he caught the bus to Reidsville State Prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was supposed to be electrocuted at midnight on a Sunday,''
Sammons says, ``but (then-governor) Herman Talmadge called about 15
minutes before they pulled the switch and commuted his sentence.''
He smiles. ``There might have been a campaign contribution made, I
don't know. There were a lot of sentences commuted back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Sammons, 57, sturdily built and sunburned, admits that he began
writing simply to make extra money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read something about how much money John Grisham was making,
so I started reading the best sellers to see what worked. Most of
those guys, like Grisham or Robert James Waller, all they want you
to do is turn the page. I wanted to write like Cormac McCarthy or
Larry McMurtry. With them, you can close your eyes and almost smell
what they're writing about.''
</P>
<P>
   He found it wasn't as easy as it looked.
</P>
<P>
   He was working on ``The Keepers of Echowah'' (pronounced
EK-O-WAH, it's a Creek Indian word for ``where sleeping deer lie'')
in his store in Highlands, N.C., five years ago when Atlanta public
relations writer Patrice Dickey walked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``She asked me what I was doing,'' Sammons says. ``I said,
`Wasting my time writing a manuscript.' She asked to read it and
said she had a friend who was a movie producer.''
</P>
<P>
   The friend was Don Daniels, who was in Atlanta at the time
producing ``Kleptomania'' with Amy Irving. Daniels liked the
manuscript and bought the rights. A year later, Cherokee Publishing
Co. of Marietta picked up the publishing rights for an undisclosed
sum. (Plans for a film are still pending, Sammons says.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me two months to write the first draft and three
months to correct the spelling,'' says Sammons, who flunked out of
every college he attended. ``I wore out two copies of Strunk &AMP;
White making sure I got the structure right.''
</P>
<P>
   Free-lance editor Alexa Selph, who worked with Sammons on the
book, was impressed with his raw talent. ``He hasn't had that much
formal education, but he's incredibly well-read. The only problem I
had with his writing was keeping him from sermonizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishers Weekly, the book industry's trade magazine, praised
the novel's ``lovely balance of lyrical nostalgia and gleefully
coarse humor.'' Others described it as a cross between Olive Ann
Burns' ``Cold Sassy Tree'' and Ferrol Sams' ``Run With the
Horsemen.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel sold more than 8,000 copies _ surprisingly well for a
first novel _ and, at one book signing in Blytheville, Ark., more
than 140 people showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We loved the book,'' says Mary Gay Shipley, owner of That
Bookstore in Blytheville. ``A lot of the people liked it because of
the nostalgia. The two boys in the book had free run of the hunting
lodge. I think there's a real longing for that sense of freedom for
children. And it was a real good little story.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sammons has mastered many skills, he admits he is as
surprised as anyone that he became a writer. Born and raised in a
four-room log house that once served as a stagecoach stop, Sammons
spent his early years roaming the woods and helping his father
farm.
</P>
<P>
   His present house, a 1906 Georgia cottage that he restored, is a
far cry from his rustic childhood home. The hardwood floors are
polished to a soft lustre, the high ceilings are trimmed with crown
moulding, and all of the original plaster has been redone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 9 or 10 when we first got electricity,'' says Sammons,
sitting at an enormous heart pine table that he built himself and
munching on a barbecue sandwich. ``We never did get indoor
plumbing. My father put all of the money he made back into the
farm.''
</P>
<P>
   After his ill-fated college career, Sammons was drafted and
served a hitch in the Army. He came back home, started a peanut
warehouse business, then opened a children's apparel manufacturing
firm and a string of auto parts stores. In 1980, friends talked him
into running for mayor. ``There's not that much prestige in being
mayor of a town of 1,200,'' says Sammons, who held the office for
10 years. ``People call you at 11 o'clock at night complaining
about a dog barking in their yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he was a good mayor, says childhood friend Jimmy
Martin. ``He got a lot of grants for the town. He always could do
anything he set his mind to. He did not make top grades, but he
could have. He had a rough time when his wife got leukemia. She was
a super nice lady.''
</P>
<P>
   The death of Sammons' wife, Chris, in 1986 nearly destroyed him.
Left with a teenage son and two daughters, he was so distraught he
considered selling everything and taking his children to Venezuela,
simply to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to retire and sit around feeling sorry for myself,
until the people I sold one business to went bankrupt, and all of a
sudden I owed the bank a million dollars and I had a $500,000 lien
from the IRS.''
</P>
<P>
   Sammons settled his debts by selling his land and all of his
assets. Starting from scratch, he decided to become a custom
furniture maker, partly because it was something he was interested
in, and partly because it helped him deal with his grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always enjoyed working with my hands, and I'd started
making furniture as a hobby, so the transition was real easy. The
good thing about it was I didn't have any set hours. Every other
business I'd owned had held me captive. When I ran the peanut
business, I had to be there from 7 in the morning until 7 at night.
They owned me. And,'' he adds, ``when you're working on a piece of
furniture, it takes your mind off other things.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did with his writing, Sammons learned to make furniture
simply by doing it until he got it right. ``I busted my thumb a lot
in the early days,'' he says, grinning. ``I stole a lot of designs.
I'd see something I'd like and add some of my own touches.
</P>
<P>
   Using heart pine from old barns, churches and abandoned
buildings, he crafted chairs, cabinets, and tables for customers in
Atlanta and Highlands. He closed his stores in Buckhead and
Highlands when he moved into the construction business, and now he
takes custom orders only and operates the company, Southern Pine,
out of a workshop in Shellman. Demand is so great they are a couple
of months behind, he says.
</P>
<P>
   He made by hand nearly all of the pieces of furniture in the
house _ from an oak secretary to a heart pine hunt board. All are
meticulously crafted and finished, with none of the plywood that is
used in a lot of mass-produced furniture. He rubs his hand along
the polished patina of the table and drapes his arm over a sturdy,
straight-backed dining chair. ``Our furniture is built to last for
generations. These chairs I built, they're uncomfortable as hell,''
he jokes. ``But they look real nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Remarried after his wife's death, Sammons and his wife, Joy, 31,
have adopted a 2-year-old daughter, Laura Joy, an energetic child
who makes Sammons' face light up every time she bounds into his
lap.
</P>
<P>
   Joy, a slim, dark-haired woman who met Sammons at Panama City
Beach nine years ago, laughs shyly about their age difference. ``I
just thought he was nice-looking. I didn't know how old he was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Age has not been a factor in our relationship,'' Sammons adds.
``We like to travel. Joy likes to work in the yard. Now she wants
to go to Georgia State and get her doctorate, so we have to think
about moving. I'll do whatever she wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sammons has turned the furniture-making business over
to his son, John, and plans to continue working on his writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to go back and read authors like Eudora Welty and
John Steinbeck to get some idea of how they did it,'' he says
between sips of homemade lemonade. ``I'd like to keep improving.''
</P>
<P>
   But if he never becomes famous as a writer, at least he has his
political legacy. His proudest accomplishment during his 10-year
stint as mayor, he deadpans, was adopting the motto, ``Shellman,
Georgia: We Have Never Heard of You Either.''

 &HT;    Journal explores growth of plant biotechnology
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday July 18.
 &HT;    By Rachael Kennedy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can't tell by look, smell or taste, but that delicious cob
of corn you're eating may not be the same corn you're used to
eating.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered a thing of science fiction, genetically modified
foods are a growing part of the world's food supply _ even though
many consumers are not sold on their safety or usefulness, new
research shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plant biotechnology is exploding. There are issues with
production; there are a lot of societal questions coming up,'' said
Brooks Hanson, deputy managing editor of the journal Science, which
explored the pros and cons of GMF in a special edition last week.
``We felt it was time to update the state of the science
surrounding the changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings from three articles in Science:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GMF are becoming commonplace. In 1996, 2 million acres
worldwide were planted with transgenic crops. By 1998, that number
had escalated to 67 million acres. Seventy-four percent of those
acres were in the United States. The only other countries with
large croplands planted with GMF were Argentina, with 15 percent of
the world's production, and Canada, with 10 percent. The five
principal crops include soybeans, corn, cotton, rapeseed/canola and
potato, and 1998 sales amounted to $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Plant biotechnology is not only being used to improve the food
supply, by allowing for bigger and faster crop production, but
recent advances have also led to the development of plants that may
be able to safely remove high levels of toxic metals from soil.
Scientists are also investigating ways plants can be modified for
industrial use.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Americans are more open to GMF than Europeans. A 1997 poll of
more than 1,000 U.S. citizens by the London School of Economics
found that 30 percent support GMF, 11 percent oppose GMF and
another 19 percent are uneasy with their use. A separate poll of
16,500 Europeans by the school found 16 percent support GMF, 22
percent oppose and 15 percent are uneasy with their use.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Americans are more opposed to genetic testing on
humans and genetic medicines than bioengineered food sources, the
school found. Researchers also said that Americans are less
scientifically literate than Europeans and expressed greater trust
in the government regulatory bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Iceland banned GMF altogether and Prince Charles and
the European Community publicly called for more regulations.

behind modification and how developing nations may benefit from
wider use of GMF.

 &HT;    Mummies and mystery at Egyptian art unveiling
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the basement of Emory University's Michael C.
Carlos Museum, an ancient coffin case, its head swathed in towels,
appears to be primping for its debut in the third floor galleries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's aromatherapy,'' kids Kate Singley, a free-lance
conservator.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Singley is trying to shore up the frail surface of the
head so that it can make it through its Atlanta unveiling without
further damage. On Monday, for one day only, the public can see the
mummies, coffin cases, canopic jars (limestone containers for
internal organs) and other objects that the Carlos purchased this
year from a Niagara Falls, Ontario, curiosity museum. A public
campaign helped raise $2 million to buy the 83 objects, some of
which are at least 3,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
   For this much-anticipated first viewing, several objects will
join the permanent collection of Egyptian art on the first floor
for a six-month rotation. The Carlos also has installed _ again,
for Monday only _ a small sampling of the acquired objects on the
third floor, including three coffins, a mummy still in the crate in
which it traveled to the Carlos in May, a bronze falcon and a
mummified cat.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cinderella, these objects will return to the conservation
lab Tuesday for further work. There is much to do before they are
shown in a large temporary exhibition planned for 2001. In addition
to restoration, the objects will be carefully studied.
Conservators, working with Peter Lacovara, Carlos curator of
ancient art, will shine a black light on the coffins and canopic
jars to see if the varnish and paint is old or new. (New paint
fluoresces.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If the paint on the canopic jars is old, then they are very
rare,'' Lacovara says. ``I only know of a few in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston Egyptologist Joyce Haynes will work to decipher the
hieroglyphs. One of her goals is to figure out the identities of
some of the mummies in the coffins. This will help Lacovara to work
out their genealogy. Emory art history professor Gay Robins will
study the painting styles.
</P>
<P>
   The mummies will go through medical hoops _ CAT scans, X-rays
and DNA testing. In an uncanny coincidence, the mummies have ended
up at one of the few places in the world where such DNA testing is
possible _ in the lab of molecular biologist Douglas Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kismet,'' says Lacovara.
</P>
<P>
   Because they suspect that one of the mummies may be Egyptian
royalty, research will require DNA testing on royal mummies in
Egypt as well as contemporary Egyptians. If the remains turn out to
be Ramses I, the Carlos has promised to return him to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   You can be sure of one thing: The Carlos will make every effort
_ in Monday's display and in its 2001 show _ to avoid any of the
ghoulishness or sensationalism that has always been part of mummy
mania.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to display the remains respectfully,'' says Therese
O'Gorman, the Andrew W. Mellon conservator at the Carlos, ``and we
want to use them as a hook to get people to learn more about
ancient art and society.''
</P>
<P>
   First Impression: A Preview of the Collection of Egyptian
Antiquities
</P>
<P>
   11 a.m.-7 p.m. Monday. Suggested donation: $3. Emory
University's Michael C. Carlos Museum, 571 S. Kilgo St. N.E.
404-727-4282. Large crowds are expected. Parking will be available
at Emory West, 1256 Briarcliff Road N.E., formerly the Georgia
Mental Health Institute, where specially designated shuttles will
provide round-trip rides to the museum. Additional parking may be
available at on-campus parking lots, but space is limited.

 &HT;    Interest grows in artifacts of slavery
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A large hand-woven seed basket, made either by slaves
or by emancipated African-Americans just after the Civil War, sits
atop an old bookcase in Nathaniel Norman's antiques shop on
Bankhead Highway. He also has an intricately carved mahogany cane,
whittled either in Africa or by African-Americans. And a one-string
musical instrument popular ``in slavery times.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman, 49, is one of the few black antiques dealers in Atlanta,
catering to blacks who no longer consider their ancestors' history
a time to forget. He's not yet a big bug in the flea market
business, but he has become a go-to guy for Atlanta-area
African-Americans who, while abhorring the oppression of their
forebears, nevertheless want to own reminders of slavery and the
Jim Crow era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people are getting interested in collecting because it
gives you a sense of who we are and where we came from,'' Norman
says.
</P>
<P>
   To stock his store, Norman's Antiques and Collectibles, he
employs a legion of ``hunters'' who bring in everything from canes
and old banjos to swords picked up on Civil War battlefields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people don't throw away nothing,'' he says, holding the
seed basket, which he bought from a 97-year-old woman whose
ancestors were slaves. ``And look at this cane. It's definitely
African. My people have stuff everywhere. There are treasures all
over, still hidden.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Thomas Jr., a 47-year-old Atlanta lawyer, collects
anything he can find from slavery times. He owns a deed describing
the sale of a little boy and a little girl, as well as slave
shackles used in the 1830s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than being a source of embarrassment, there's a
tremendous source of pride to see how far we've come as a people,''
says Thomas, who uses the items as props in frequent talks to
school groups. ``To deny history is not good for our community, or
our kids. If we accept it and explain it, it creates a much
healthier environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the shackles makes children ``really sit up,'' Thomas
says. ``They find it a little hard to believe this really
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Browsing in Norman's cluttered store, John Burrison, 56, a
professor of culture at Georgia State University, is immediately
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Gently touching the seed basket, Burrison, who has a permanent
collection of folk art at the Atlanta History Center, says, ``I've
never seen anything like it.'' Then he sees a hand-carved mahogany
cane, which leaves him breathless. ``It's distinctly
African-American,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Growing interest in relics of slave times has created a market
nationally. Shackles can be purchased on the Internet, and one Web
site recently advertised an ``extremely rare female slave collar''
for nearly $9,000.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, slave deeds and bills of sale could be had for as
little as $50, but those days are gone. Today, such items bring
five to 10 times as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this stuff is just now starting to come out,'' says
Norman. ``Some are just now finding it. And a lot have it but don't
know what to do with it.''

 &HT;    From attic to basement, atlantans' homes are full of intriguing
artifacts
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gingerly, Paul Hineman opens a weathered cardboard
box, slowly unfurling a tattered Old Glory, with 38 stars, that he
says draped the coffin of Ulysses S. Grant in 1886.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Brown, manager of Red Baron's Antiques in Sandy Springs
(Ga.), is _ ahem _ more than a tad dubious. One of the South's
premier experts on antiques, he's constantly fending off excited
patrons trying to peddle valueless junk that they think is
priceless.
</P>
<P>
   But this time it's different.
</P>
<P>
   Hineman, 34, offers documentation: yellowed newspaper clips,
family letters and a 1936 Good Housekeeping magazine article about
the flag, which he inherited from his grandmother. Brown studies
the flag and documents, then scribbles out a $7,000 check.
</P>
<P>
   There may no longer be gold in the hills of Dahlonega (Ga.), but
there's definitely a heap of gold in them thar attics, basements
and long-stored cedar chests all around Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, and especially Southerners, are keepers, Brown says.
Which is why, whether you live in a mobile home or a million-dollar
mansion, the odds are that many of your neighbors could show you
relics you'd be hard-pressed to find in a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in historical artifacts has been heightened by eBay, an
Internet auction site, and PBS's popular ``Antiques Road Show.''
They've sent millions of people rummaging through barns, attics and
basements looking for reminders of the past, to sell or to preserve
for themselves. Dealers such as Brown spend lots of time eyeballing
objects for people who want someone to authenticate, or perhaps
buy, interesting items that they've had for decades or picked up at
garage sales.
</P>
<P>
   Take Henry W. Grady III, 37, an investment specialist and the
great-great-grandson of Henry W. Grady, famous for his editorship
of The Atlanta Constitution in the 1880s. The first Henry Grady's
father, Maj. William S. Grady, was a Confederate cavalryman, and
his Tiffany sword has been passed down for five generations.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Grady took the sword to Frank Walsh, co-owner of
Yesteryear Book Shop in Atlanta and a sometime appraiser for the
``Road Show.'' Walsh said it would fetch somewhere between $5,000
and $10,000 at auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was only curiosity,'' says Grady. ``Obviously, I
wouldn't sell at any price.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans to pass the sword down to his three daughters or donate
it to the University of Georgia, his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Grady and Hineman were among several hundred people who
responded to a notice in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution inviting
owners of pre-World I relics to call us. What metro Atlantans told
us they own ran the gamut, from a 15th-century German prayer book
to the diary of former Georgia Gov. Hoke Smith, from a slightly
used 1800s coffin to a teapot from the Great London Exposition of
1851.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just monetary value that drives most people to hold on
to heirlooms or buy historical relics. Many, like Grady, do so for
sentimental reasons, to maintain a connection with the past.
</P>
<P>
   John Crosswell, 77, of Covington still has a July 2, 1863,
edition of the Vicksburg Daily Citizen that he traded ``a no-good,
broken-down bicycle for'' 65 years ago. ``It's a piece of
history,'' he observes.
</P>
<P>
   Brown says the country is full of such relics, though many
aren't as well cared for as Crosswell's Civil War newspaper has
been.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous amount out there,'' Brown says. ``People
die and move on, go from bigger to smaller houses as they age. They
give things to the grandaughter or son or whatever. And they put it
in the basement because people don't realize its value, or it
doesn't fit in with their lives. It's unbelievable, the things you
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people, however, do realize the value. That's why estate
sales often attract lots of potential buyers. Walsh, of Yesteryear
Book Shop, believes that nostalgia is being fueled partly by the
approaching millennium, which makes many baby boomers feel old, as
they realize that many of their childhood toys, such as original
Mickey Mouse hats, are now considered antiques.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in collectibles is so keen that the Atlanta History
Center has scheduled a collectors' day Sept. 18, at which experts
such as Walsh and Brown will examine relics. And on Aug. 5, when
the American Political Items Collectors hold their national
convention in Atlanta, thousands of owners of old political
ribbons, buttons and posters will converge here from around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we move around so much, and as so many Americans are cut
off from neighbors and ordinary friendliness in daily life, we
treasure these objects that help us feel connected,''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Paul Brown, son of the Red Baron's manager, who also works
for the store: ``With the relics we own, we all become portals to
the past, portals which everyone, whether they are aware or not, is
drawn into. Part of the human condition involves, often on a
subconscious level, being a part of something greater than the sum
of its parts.''
</P>
<P>
   One recent morning, Bob Linzey, an executive with the
Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co., proudly showed Walsh a 431-year-old German
prayer book, printed with carved wooden blocks. The antiques expert
was almost at a loss for words.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is marvelous,'' Walsh whispered. ``Look at this date in
Latin, `MDLXVIII' _ 1568. Look, someone has written in the margins.
The covers are made of wood, and it's bound with brass hinges.
Remarkable!''
</P>
<P>
   Linzey wasn't interested in selling, and though Walsh is an
expert on antique books, he was hesitant to put a value on this
one, suggesting that someone at Emory University's Candler School
of Theology should take a look. Linzey got the thick volume,
containing several thousand pages, from a long-dead friend who had
found it in the eaves of a bombed-out house in Germany during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   In the South, Civil War relics are always hot.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they're even too hot to handle, says Brown. ``I've had
people sell muskets that go off _ they didn't know it was loaded.
And artillery shells are still dug up.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman James, 58, of Newnan (GA.) found his Union artillery
shell on his great-grandfather's farm near the site of the 1864
Battle of Kennesaw Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was plowed up back in the '50s,'' he says. ``I keep it in
my closet. This one was a dud, but it still had black powder in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shells and cannonballs can be found in most antiques stores,
says John Sexton, owner of Stone Mountain Relics, and some can be
worth several hundred dollars to museums or collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emotion in those things is important, especially in the
South,'' he says. ``That's one reason Confederate swords can go up
into the tens of thousands of dollars, easily. They're much more
valuable than Union swords, which aren't as rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Kohlhoff's Civil War-era collection includes two
unredeemed Confederate $1,000 bonds _ which, had the Confederacy
endured, would each be worth $2.6 million today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the South ever rises again, I'll be in high cotton,'' jokes
Kohlhoff, 51. He also owns a quilt made by slaves, a first edition
of ``Alice in Wonderland,'' published in 1865, and Confederate
10-cent scrip printed by Mechanics Bank in Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   Even discharge papers from the Civil War era can fetch several
hundred dollars, Kohlhoff adds, and a copy of the parole issued to
the 30,000 men who surrendered at Appomattox with Robert E. Lee is
easily worth $3,000 or more. Even at that price, he adds, ``they
are almost impossible to find,'' because their owners aren't
interested in selling them.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Kasey Walter, 51, of Marietta (GA.) says,
``There's some things you can't put a price on,'' such as her
husband John's collection of 39 letters, eloquently written in 1864
by his great-great-grandfather, Charles Shepard, a Union soldier
who encountered the legendary Confederate unit Mosby's Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He describes raids by Mosby's Raiders, and what's interesting
is, my great-grandfather was in Mosby's Raiders. They probably
fought against each other!''
</P>
<P>
   Many relics that people consider priceless, however, have little
value on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century coffin owned by Harriet Rowland of Forest Park
(GA.) is ``very strange,'' she says. ``It's made of oak with a
cedar lid. At one time there was a body inside. You can still see
bloodstains. I keep it in my barn because there's a ghost that came
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the private-collection spectrum are items
that many museums would love to have, such as a bronze spoon, now
owned by Jessica Simmons, that was once used by a soldier in the
army of Oliver Cromwell, who led a revolution in 17th-century
England. Her grandfather found it while digging in his garden in
Kent, England, in 1953 and had it authenicated by the British
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Or the 1st century A.D. bowls and jars that Joseph Hassell, 78,
of Acworth (GA.) brought home from Turkey in the 1950s and had
authenticated by the Corning Museum of Glass in New York. Says
Hassell: ``I've had them in a shoe box in my closet ever since.''

WOULD-BE GAME PLAYERS TAPPED OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By DAVID BLOOM 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They came. They saw. Their credit cards bounced.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nearly perfect ending for Hollywood Video and Sega, who
combined this week for a late-night promotional gimmick at the
video rental company's Westwood store and four others around the
country as it began renting its Dreamcast gaming machine.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time a new videogame console had ever been
offered for rental before the machine was available for sale, said
Sega of America president and chief operations officer Bernard
Stolar. Dreamcast goes on sale Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 people formed two lines outside the store, where they
waited for up to several hours to be among the first to rent the
next-generation gaming machine at 12:01 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The companies tried to make their wait worthwhile, with pizza
and soft drinks, appearances and autographs by a few pneumatically
generic TV starlets, giveaways (including two Dreamcast machines)
and more.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, when it came right down to actually renting the
machines, for many the spirit was willing but the credit limit was
weak.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Video is requiring a $350 deposit to rent the machine
for two nights (along with $19.99 for the game rental).
</P>
<P>
   For a lot of the scruffy game freaks who'd been waiting for
their chance at the hot new machine, this was way more freight than
their slender credit line could bear.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Entertainment president Jeffrey Yapp said the stout
charge covers the cost of the machine, two controllers and game,
along with a little bit more, to make sure it all comes back.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, nearly a fourth of the roughly 1,300 Hollywood
Video stores won't even have the game machines, solely because
customers in those neighborhoods aren't very good about bringing
stuff back, Yapp said. The machines should be widely available in
Los Angeles outlets, however.
</P>
<P>
   The stout credit requirements whittled the crowd quickly by
midnight, leaving Megan Koplin-Panzer of Beverly Hills and her
family second in line, even though about 20 people had been ahead
of her husband and son when they first showed up around 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, however, her son, D.J., was brandishing the black
plastic briefcase holding the game equipment as they marched out of
the store.
</P>
<P>
   Though only Sonic Adventure was available for rental on
Thursday, three other titles are coming before the machine goes on
sale, said Stolar.
</P>
<P>
   Ready 2 Rumble, a boxing game, and Powerstone, a hybrid
adventure and fighting game, will come out within a few weeks,
Stolar said. And just before Sept. 9, the much-awaited football
title, NFL 2000, will roll out.
</P>
<P>
   The rental package includes the basic Dreamcast machine, two
controllers and an RF converter to connect the machine to a TV set.
Additional rental games will go for $4.99, the same price Hollywood
charges for Nintendo 64 and PlayStation games. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Local waves
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know the Internet is supposed to make everything global.
But lately, I've run across a raft of Los Angeles-based or
-oriented Web sites that are worth checking out. Remember the old
political adage: Everything is local.
</P>
<P>
   One of the new sites is really new. In fact, LA2Nite.com (at
www.la2nite.com) officially opens for business today.
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild of three youthful Princeton grads, the site is
led by chief operations officer Elizabeth Peterson, a long-time
veteran of the Los Angeles music scene as a booker and promoter at
prominent clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The site, she said, will focus on an array of local music
scenes, including Latin, jazz, electronica, pop and more.
Peterson's four-person editorial staff also will report on local
art and culture, particularly in under-covered areas such as the
Eastside and gay scenes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The preview site is handsome enough, and the site is
aggressively marketing itself by giving away tickets and a car, and
co-sponsoring a July 25 concert of dance-music performers at the
John Anson Ford Amphitheatre.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said the site plans to make money by selling tickets to
shows at medium-sized and smaller venues in Los Angeles, and will
be involved in many concerts itself.
</P>
<P>
   I wish them luck, though they'll have plenty of competition for
business, starting with Ticketmaster, the ticket-selling giant
whose offices ironically are just across the courtyard from
LA2Nite's mid-Wilshire office building.
</P>
<P>
   Another site that particularly caught my eye is Inside DVD
(atwww.insidedvd.com), in Altadena. If you're a DVD fan, you should
like this one.
</P>
<P>
   Register for its magazine on-site and you'll be sent a DVD full
of game demos, movie trailers, DVD news, music samplers and, on the
back side of the disc, a complete movie. The films aren't
particularly big-time ones, of course, but they're legitimate
theatrical releases and the price
 &UR; !ital! &LR; is tough to beat.
</P>
<P>
   I had some qualms about information requested in the
registration process, but unlike so many other Web sites, at least
there was a clear return of something of value for my investment.
</P>
<P>
   You can check out the site without getting the magazine, and
there's an array of odds and ends there that may be of use to the
DVD-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of DVDs, disc seller/renter DVD Express
(www.dvdexpress.com) just cut a deal with the Hollywood
Entertainment Museum to create what it's calling the Hollywood
Backlot, an area where entertainment-oriented memorabilia is
auctioned off.
</P>
<P>
   Recent goodies for sale included an autographed guitar from Soul
Asylum (fetching an inexplicably high $1,500 bid at last glance), a

<P>
   DVD Express is branching out a bit, too, selling games for
PlayStation, Game Boy and Nintendo 64, computer games and DVD-ROM
software, and even some gadgets and gizmos that may appeal to DVD
enthusiasts.

<P>
   And speaking of concerts, LA Live (at www.lalive.com) remains a
good choice, especially if you have a faster connection and the
right streaming media plug-ins to enjoy their live concert
transmissions from 15 affiliated venues in the region.

   Finally, another recent local startup is L.A. Woman magazine
(lawomanmagazine.com), based in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher Marjorie Padorr said she wants to make the site a
forum for women with articles, discussion areas, a calendar
section, interviews and more.
</P>
<P>
   A book author and Peabody Award winner for radio reporting,
Padorr said she hopes to publish a hard-copy version of the
magazine someday soon, but will concentrate on the online version
for now.
</P>
<P>
   The site's writing is still a bit raw and the look is
graphically unsophisticated. But the site pointed out films that
may appeal to women and offered tips, for example, on how to
organize the endless paperwork of what was supposed to be a
paperless technology revolution.

HILLARY CLINTON FACES DISPUTE OVER BOMBING RANGE IN PUERTO RICO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 18)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A remote tropical island off Puerto Rico where Navy
and Marine Corps pilots practice their bombing runs may seem a long
way from New York politics and the burgeoning Senate campaign of
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But just wait.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will soon face a ticklish political dilemma in her
exploratory Senate campaign: whether to support Puerto Rico's
demands that U.S. pilots permanently halt bombing the island of
Vieques or the U.S. Navy's contention that the bombing is essential
to America's military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton goes forward with her bid to succeed retiring Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., her decision in the Vieques
controversy could determine whether she wins the enthusiastic
support of two million Puerto Ricans who live in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jose E. Serrano, D-N.Y., the Bronx-based lawmaker who is
the most senior Puerto Rican native in Congress, said Friday that
Puerto Ricans in New York are watching Clinton closely on this
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to hear an agenda for my district, for my state and for
my nation,'' said Serrano, whose congressional district is 60
percent Hispanic. ``I also want to hear about Vieques.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said the outcome of the Vieques
dispute has become a make-or-break issue for Puerto Rican voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all talk about it,'' said Menendez, whose congressional
district is 42 percent Hispanic. ``The bottom line is that this is
a major issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carlos Romero-Barcelo, the former governor of Puerto Rico
who represents the territory's 3.8 million residents as the
non-voting member of Congress, says the future of military
maneuvers on Vieques is ``a defining moment in Puerto Rico's
relationship with the rest of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The island is located eight miles east of mainland Puerto Rico,
a former Spanish colony seized by the United States in the
Spanish-American War in 1898. Residents of Puerto Rico are U.S.
citizens but they pay no U.S. taxes and do not vote for president.
However, if they move to the mainland, they can vote when they meet
local election eligibility rules.
</P>
<P>
   Navy pilots have used a 24,000-acre bombing range on the
33,000-acre island to prepare for every major military operation
since World War II, including the Persian Gulf War and the U.S.-led
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But Vieques has become a litmus test for many Puerto Ricans
since two Marine Corps' FA-18 pilots mistakenly dropped two
500-pound bombs about a mile off-target during night training on
April 19. The bombs killed security guard David Sanes Rodriguez,
35, a civilian employee of the Navy, and injured four others.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Secretary Richard Danzig suspended live fire training on
the island of 9,300 pending the outcome of a Pentagon review
ordered after the mishap.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican demonstrators have occupied the bombing range ever
since the accident. Nearly 50,000 residents protested the Navy's
use of Vieques outside the gates of the Roosevelt Roads Naval Base
in Puerto Rico on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico's political leaders are demanding the Navy's
withdrawal. Romero-Barcelo vows to join the protesters occupying
the training range if live fire training is resumed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not accept bombing under any circumstances,''
Romero-Barcelo said. ``We will do whatever we have to do to stop
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Serrano says he will use his powers on the Republican-led House
Appropriations Committee to ``make the point that dollars should
not be spent on bombing'' Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will make a decision next month on whether to
resume live fire exercises after he receives the recommendations of
a four-member Pentagon review panel appointed at his request on
June 9.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano said that the first lady should weigh in with the
president after he receives the Pentagon report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you are running for the Senate in a state that has
more Puerto Ricans than most cities in Puerto Rico, you definitely
have a role to play,'' Serrano said. ``I really think she should be
alerting the president to the fact that (Navy withdrawal) is
something that should happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Serrano added: ``It certainly would look good to Puerto Ricans
in New York state if she were to help us with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the first lady nor the president has taken a public
position on the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Berry, the first lady's White House press secretary, said
that Mrs. Clinton awaits the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants to have the process proceed and see what the
findings are from the testimony,'' Berry said. ``At some point she
will have an opinion on it and will play a role in the
deliberations.''
</P>
<P>
   Cmdr. Brian Cullin, a spokesman for the secretary of the Navy,
says the Navy anticipates that the White House decision may trigger
congressional hearings into the dispute, no matter what the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers representing Puerto Rican voters in congressional
districts vowed to press for congressional hearings if bombing is
resumed _ a course that assures that the issue will remain in the
spotlight.

<P>
   If Clinton decides to run for the Senate, campaign strategists
say that she must sweep the Hispanic vote in New York City to
offset her Republican rival's expected support in upstate New York
and in the New York City suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   But recent New York elections show Clinton could face
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic support helped re-elect New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, a Republican, who carried 43 percent of the Hispanic vote
in New York City in 1997. Hispanics, including Puerto Ricans, made
up 20 percent of the New York City vote in that election.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is weighing a Senate campaign against Clinton. Other
potential GOP rivals include two congressmen from Manhattan's
suburbs, Reps. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., and Peter King, R-N.Y. ,
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics proved an important factor last year in the ouster of
veteran Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y. Then-Rep. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., swept 82 percent of the Hispanic vote statewide in a
contest in which Hispanics accounted for 6 percent of the statewide
electorate.

   The White House asked the Pentagon to appoint the review panel
on June 9 _ almost two months after the accident and less than a
month before Mrs. Clinton created a fund raising committee to
underwrite her exploration of a Senate campaign from New York.
</P>
<P>
   The four-member panel named by Defense Secretary William Cohen
includes chairman Frank Rush, acting assistant secretary of defense
for force management policy; retired Marine Corps Gen. Richard
Neal, a former assistant commandant of the Marine Corps; retired
Navy Vice Adm. Diego Hernandez, a former commander of the
Japan-based Third Fleet; and retired Rep. Lee H. Hamilton, former
chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee.

 &HT;    CISNEROS JUDGE HINTS HE'LL ALLOW SOME TAPES AS EVIDENCE
 &HT;    BY JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin strongly hinted
Friday that he would allow some secretly recorded tapes of former
housing secretary Henry Cisneros discussing alleged ``hush
payments'' with his ex-mistress to be used as evidence in
Cisneros's upcoming trial.
</P>
<P>
   Concluding a 13-day pretrial hearing that stretched over four
weeks, Sporkin told both sides that he expected to take the
``middle road,'' accepting some, but not the most altered,
recordings made by Linda Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of this is going out,'' Sporkin said of the tapes. ``I
can't buy your argument in total,'' he told the prosecution. ``And
I can't buy their argument in total.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Cisneros argued vigorously that the tapes were
``inauthentic'' because only duplicate recordings exist and Jones
deleted parts of at least four.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a typed letter high in the air, defense lawyer Brendan
V. Sullivan Jr. dramatized his argument by calling the paper
``evidence.'' He tore out the middle paragraphs of the paper and
patched up the rest with cellophane tape, and then asked if what
remained should be accepted in a court of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tapes, as we know, are very powerful evidence,'' Sullivan told
Sporkin. ``And tapes that are altered are powerfully misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan also blasted the contention that Jones, who has
admitted to lying repeatedly to officials, could reliably testify
about the conversations she left out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot rely upon a liar,'' Sullivan told the judge.
Turning up his energy, he later added, ``It's an insult to the
court that she has been brought into this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the prosecution, Jim Fleissner, a professor at
Mercer Law School in Macon, Ga., argued that the tapes fall under
the rules for the best possible evidence available. He asked
Sporkin to let the jury to hear both the tapes and Jones's
testimony and make its decision.
</P>
<P>
   Fleissner cited one edited tape, saying that the court can hear
Cisneros ``talk about his fear of being in contempt of Congress for
making false statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, former mayor of San Antonio, is charged with lying to
federal officials about paying Jones a total of $250,000 in alleged
``hush money.'' At the time, Cisneros was undergoing a security
background check before he was selected by President Clinton in
1993 to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   The case dates to a 1997 indictment that followed a probe by
independent counsel David Barrett. Defense appeals and the

HILLARY CLINTON FACES DISPUTE OVER BOMBING RANGE IN PUERTO RICO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 18)   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``p'' categories)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A remote tropical island off Puerto Rico where Navy
and Marine Corps pilots practice their bombing runs may seem a long
way from New York politics and the burgeoning Senate campaign of
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But just wait.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will soon face a ticklish political dilemma in her
exploratory Senate campaign: whether to support Puerto Rico's
demands that U.S. pilots permanently halt bombing the island of
Vieques or the U.S. Navy's contention that the bombing is essential
to America's military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton goes forward with her bid to succeed retiring Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., her decision in the Vieques
controversy could determine whether she wins the enthusiastic
support of two million Puerto Ricans who live in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jose E. Serrano, D-N.Y., the Bronx-based lawmaker who is
the most senior Puerto Rican native in Congress, said Friday that
Puerto Ricans in New York are watching Clinton closely on this
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to hear an agenda for my district, for my state and for
my nation,'' said Serrano, whose congressional district is 60
percent Hispanic. ``I also want to hear about Vieques.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said the outcome of the Vieques
dispute has become a make-or-break issue for Puerto Rican voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all talk about it,'' said Menendez, whose congressional
district is 42 percent Hispanic. ``The bottom line is that this is
a major issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carlos Romero-Barcelo, the former governor of Puerto Rico
who represents the territory's 3.8 million residents as the
non-voting member of Congress, says the future of military
maneuvers on Vieques is ``a defining moment in Puerto Rico's
relationship with the rest of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The island is located eight miles east of mainland Puerto Rico,
a former Spanish colony seized by the United States in the
Spanish-American War in 1898. Residents of Puerto Rico are U.S.
citizens but they pay no U.S. taxes and do not vote for president.
However, if they move to the mainland, they can vote when they meet
local election eligibility rules.
</P>
<P>
   Navy pilots have used a 24,000-acre bombing range on the
33,000-acre island to prepare for every major military operation
since World War II, including the Persian Gulf War and the U.S.-led
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But Vieques has become a litmus test for many Puerto Ricans
since two Marine Corps' FA-18 pilots mistakenly dropped two
500-pound bombs about a mile off-target during night training on
April 19. The bombs killed security guard David Sanes Rodriguez,
35, a civilian employee of the Navy, and injured four others.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Secretary Richard Danzig suspended live fire training on
the island of 9,300 pending the outcome of a Pentagon review
ordered after the mishap.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican demonstrators have occupied the bombing range ever
since the accident. Nearly 50,000 residents protested the Navy's
use of Vieques outside the gates of the Roosevelt Roads Naval Base
in Puerto Rico on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico's political leaders are demanding the Navy's
withdrawal. Romero-Barcelo vows to join the protesters occupying
the training range if live fire training is resumed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not accept bombing under any circumstances,''
Romero-Barcelo said. ``We will do whatever we have to do to stop
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Serrano says he will use his powers on the Republican-led House
Appropriations Committee to ``make the point that dollars should
not be spent on bombing'' Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will make a decision next month on whether to
resume live fire exercises after he receives the recommendations of
a four-member Pentagon review panel appointed at his request on
June 9.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano said that the first lady should weigh in with the
president after he receives the Pentagon report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you are running for the Senate in a state that has
more Puerto Ricans than most cities in Puerto Rico, you definitely
have a role to play,'' Serrano said. ``I really think she should be
alerting the president to the fact that (Navy withdrawal) is
something that should happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Serrano added: ``It certainly would look good to Puerto Ricans
in New York state if she were to help us with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the first lady nor the president has taken a public
position on the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Berry, the first lady's White House press secretary, said
that Mrs. Clinton awaits the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants to have the process proceed and see what the
findings are from the testimony,'' Berry said. ``At some point she
will have an opinion on it and will play a role in the
deliberations.''
</P>
<P>
   Cmdr. Brian Cullin, a spokesman for the secretary of the Navy,
says the Navy anticipates that the White House decision may trigger
congressional hearings into the dispute, no matter what the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers representing Puerto Rican voters in congressional
districts vowed to press for congressional hearings if bombing is
resumed _ a course that assures that the issue will remain in the
spotlight.

<P>
   If Clinton decides to run for the Senate, campaign strategists
say that she must sweep the Hispanic vote in New York City to
offset her Republican rival's expected support in upstate New York
and in the New York City suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   But recent New York elections show Clinton could face
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic support helped re-elect New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, a Republican, who carried 43 percent of the Hispanic vote
in New York City in 1997. Hispanics, including Puerto Ricans, made
up 20 percent of the New York City vote in that election.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is weighing a Senate campaign against Clinton. Other
potential GOP rivals include two congressmen from Manhattan's
suburbs, Reps. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., and Peter King, R-N.Y. ,
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics proved an important factor last year in the ouster of
veteran Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y. Then-Rep. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., swept 82 percent of the Hispanic vote statewide in a
contest in which Hispanics accounted for 6 percent of the statewide
electorate.

<P>
   The White House asked the Pentagon to appoint the review panel
on June 9 _ almost two months after the accident and less than a
month before Mrs. Clinton created a fund raising committee to
underwrite her exploration of a Senate campaign from New York.
</P>
<P>
   The four-member panel named by Defense Secretary William Cohen
includes chairman Frank Rush, acting assistant secretary of defense
for force management policy; retired Marine Corps Gen. Richard
Neal, a former assistant commandant of the Marine Corps; retired
Navy Vice Adm. Diego Hernandez, a former commander of the
Japan-based Third Fleet; and retired Rep. Lee H. Hamilton, former
chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee.

ANALYSIS: NEW, YET HOPEFUL, TWISTS TOWARD A DELAYED PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Unremarkably, the Rev. Ian Paisley
was on his feet with an objection. His voice rumbled with biblical
fury, his body shook, his finger shot out along its accustomed
accusatory trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   Why, he asked the chair, was he not permitted to speak first?
Across the blue-carpeted well of the Northern Ireland Assembly
chamber stood the man who had been recognized, Gerry Adams, the
president of Sinn Fein, the largely Roman Catholic party that
represents the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   Adams saw his opportunity. With a genial smile, he offered to
yield to Paisley, his sworn enemy, who leads the hard-line
Protestant Ulster Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The response came thundering back: ``I will not speak on the
grace and favor of a member of the IRA military council.'' Paisley
sat down, and Adams told him he was ``disgraceful.''
</P>
<P>
   This mean-spirited little burlesque typified the demeaning
spectacle on Thursday with which the Northern Ireland Assembly held
the most momentous session of its year-old existence and then
promptly shut down indefinitely as fulfillment of the peace
agreement that created it ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   But the histrionic moment also illustrated changes in the public
life of this conflicted British province that give the current
breakdown a chance of ending up as more of a loss of momentum than
an abandonment of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Any kind of dialogue between foes in the same room represents
progress. When Adams and his party joined the talks that led to the
Good Friday Agreement of April 1998, Paisley and his party walked
out.
</P>
<P>
   That the two men should choose to devote their brief quality
time together to rebuking one another is simply dealing in the
local currency. David Ervine, leader of the Progressive Unionist
Party, once remarked, ``Northern Ireland is the only place I know
where someone will drive 100 miles out of his way just to receive
an insult.''
</P>
<P>
   Progress in putting into place the new political arrangements
mandated by the peace settlement ended Thursday when the main
Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, boycotted the Assembly
session that was to nominate the 10 members of the Cabinet to run
the new Ulster government.
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, the leader of the Ulster Unionists and the first
minister of the Assembly, said his party had decided that it could
not enter government with Sinn Fein as long as the IRA refused to
turn over its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing the joint Catholic-Protestant leadership would have
led to the transfer of legislative powers from the British
Parliament to the Assembly on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   That step represented to the sponsors of the peace accord, Prime
Minister Tony Blair of Britain and his Irish counterpart, Bertie
Ahern, the assurance of an irreversible stabilization of public
life in Northern Ireland. In the last 30 years the province has
been regularly convulsed by violence that has taken more than 3,200
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The smoke clearing from Thursday's crash disclosed a political
vacuum that is particularly feared here because of the
opportunities such spaces have always offered Ulster's men of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   But it also showed a reassuring new stability that is a product
of two years of false starts and tortuous negotiations:
paramilitary groups have maintained their cease-fires, and there
has been no saber-rattling from their political representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Construction cranes dot the skyline of Belfast, with growing
business activity creating jobs for the working-class men who, when
unemployed, were easy targets for paramilitary recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Gillespie, chairman of the Northern Ireland Industrial
Development Board, said on BBC Ulster Friday morning that foreign
investment had doubled in the last year because of the perception
of peace. The politicians may pause, he said, ``but business goes
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein has transformed itself into a credible and
increasingly powerful force, attracting growing numbers of voters
and fielding candidates in elections for the British, Irish and
European parliaments. An IRA return to violence would put all that
at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists now speak directly to Sinn Fein delegates,
something they refused to do through the entire negotiation on the
agreement. In a statement directed at Sinn Fein on Thursday night,
Trimble said, ``We know this can't work without you,'' an
unimaginable comment to come from a Unionist leader only a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in London, Blair said: ``People now talk; that is
itself an extraordinary event. Peace is not perfect, but compare it
to five or six years ago and the progress is immense.''
</P>
<P>
   Confidence has always been scarce in Northern Irish politics,
and the frantic recent weeks of missed deadlines, new proposals,
amendments and marathon negotiations have strained even the limited
trust that was evolving.
</P>
<P>
   Blair is widely praised for the energy he has devoted to
Northern Ireland, but he is seen as having overreached and lost his
normally disciplined way in trying to come up with a deal. He
angered the Unionists by forcing Thursday's deadline on them, and
he infuriated Sinn Fein by offering last-minute concessions to the
Unionists.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble's rejectionist stance has strengthened him within his
party, many of whose members are unenthusiastic about the peace
agreement, but it may cost him his job as first minister. It has
diminished the prestige he once enjoyed outside Northern Ireland as
the winner of the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize with John Hume, the head
of the moderate Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   Hume's closest associate, Seamus Mallon, resigned his post as
deputy first minister on Thursday to protest Trimble's boycott.
</P>
<P>
   The confidence building over the next months is essential
because when the parties return to the task of peacemaking they
will almost certainly be facing the same impasse over guerrilla
disarmament and sharing government power with Sinn Fein that
blocked their way this week.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Sinn Fein promised that it would seek IRA
handovers of weapons if it got its Cabinet seats first. The
Unionists promised that they would let Sinn Fein have its
ministries if the IRA turned in some guns first. Their summer job
is to come up with something to make those promises more
trustworthy in the fall.

   APOLLO-MAIN _ CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Thirty years after men
first left Earth to walk on the moon, most of the surviving
moonwalkers gathered here to remember the event. Apollo 11
astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin are among at least seven
Apollo astronauts who were scheduled to appear at a 5:30 p.m. press
conference on Friday. They were also scheduled to speak at an
evening dinner, which will include many of the people who worked on
the Apollo program. But there was a twinge of sadness to the
occasion: one of their members, Apollo 12 astronaut Pete Conrad,
died last week when he crashed his motorcycle. Now only nine of the
12 men who walked on the moon are still alive. (Gaffney, Dayton
Daily News). 30.

   WEISS _ BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Mel Weiss, one of America's premier
lawyers in class-action litigation, will speak in Boca today about
the settlement proposal for Holocaust survivors. For more than
three decades, Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &AMP; Lerach has represented
plaintiffs in some of the biggest and most complex cases in the
history of United States antitrust, consumer, insurance,
environmental and securities fraud class actions. Some are quite
well-known: the Exxon Valdez oil-spill case, which resulted in a
$5.3 billion verdict; the Prudential Insurance deceptive sales
practices case, in which policyholders stand to get back $2
billion; and the Lincoln Savings &AMP; Loan scandal, where Weiss sued
and recovered $240 million lost by stock investors. Weiss now
representing Holocaust survivors in their $20 billion claims
against three Swiss banks accused of storing fortunes plundered by
the Nazis during World War II. His class-action suit led to the
creation of the compensation fund. (Sorentrue/Mack, Palm Beach

   BARAK-PALESTINE - HEBRON - U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak would find a good reality check
for their peace talks in the Street of the Martyrs in Hebron. Here,
the United States literally tried to pave the way to peace and
failed. The 400 meter stretch of road was beautified with $2.5
million in American aid money, but the Israelis, who control this
area of the city, don't allow Palestinians to drive there. The
fortified road blocks on the street divide the city, drag the local
Palestinian merchants into bankruptcy and make them distrust
American intentions, as well as the peace process itself. ``I don't
trust the American administration. They do things just for the
Israelis,'' says shop keeper Monther Shahin. ``This street is a big
example.'' It's not the only example. Throughout the West Bank,
Palestinians are getting impatient waiting for items _ land, roads
and economic perks _ listed in old agreements. (Kaplow, Cox News

Islands is expecting a bumper crop of visitors to its beaches this
year. Hopefully, the kind that lay plenty of eggs. Nesting
leatherback turtles flocked to the island in 1997. The world's
largest turtles breed once every two to three years, so scientists
expect another peak number of turtles in 1999. The nesting season
should peak in June. Leatherback turtles, an endangered species
worldwide, grow to seven feet long and weigh 1,200 pounds. (Emling,

How does somebody in Nebraska come to write a check for an unknown,

JUDGE LIKELY TO PERMIT TAPES IN CISNEROS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge signalled Friday that he would
allow secretly recorded conversations into evidence against former
Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros, but would throw out some of the
most heavily altered tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes are crucial to Independent Counsel David Barrett's
case and damaging to Cisneros, whose lawyers had urged the judge to
throw out all the cassettes because they are duplicates.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros is charged in a 21-count indictment with orchestrating
a conspiracy to conceal the $250,000 he paid to Jones to protect
his nomination to head the Department of Housing and Urban
Development under President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tapes, we all know, are very powerful evidence,'' said Brendan
Sullivan, a lawyer who is defending Cisneros against the conspiracy
charges. ``And tapes that are altered are powerfully misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor James Fleissner argued that the government should be
allowed to use the tapes produced by Linda Jones, with whom
Cisneros had an affair and who worried that the $4,000 he was
paying her each month would be cut off if he became secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Fleissner argued that Cisneros' own statements on the tapes were
key to the government's case, including the recorded admission that
he feared he would be ``in contempt of Congress'' if he lied about
the payments to FBI agents conducting a background investigation
into the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors want to use 26 tapes, but U.S. District Judge
Stanley Sporkin was clearly troubled by four cassettes that were
edited to eliminate details embarrassing to Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of this is going out, as far as I am concerned. It's a
matter of fairness,'' said Sporkin, who must still rule on the
admissibility of the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The judge told prosecutors and defense lawyers he couldn't
accept either sides' ``argument in total.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the 13-day pre-trial hearing, Sporkin said he could
not find that Jones, also known by her married name, Linda Medlar,
violated federal wiretap statutes.
</P>
<P>
   If she had made the tapes with the criminal intent to commit
blackmail or extortion, Sporkin could have thrown out the entire
batch of 88 cassettes she made of conversations with Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin agreed Friday to listen to some of the 26 tapes,
portions of which the government wants to play to jurors when the
conspiracy trial begins on Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Jones pleaded guilty to charges in a 28-count federal indictment
in Texas that outline her role in the conspiracy and acceptance of
funds funneled from Cisneros to her through relatives, who then
bought a home for Jones in Lubbock, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is serving a 3 1/2-year prison sentence at a medical
center in Fort Worth. She agreed to testify against Cisneros in
exchange for a reduction in her sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros was San Antonio mayor from 1981 to 1989 and was housing
secretary from 1993 to 1996. He is currently the president of the
Spanish-language television network Univision in Los Angeles.

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers sought to make Jones the focus in the
pre-trial hearing, bringing in witnesses to testify that she lied
over and over to prosecutors and judges in Texas and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Jones testified that she tampered with several of the tapes at
the direction of her Lubbock lawyers, Bruce Magness and Floyd
Holder. Both men took the stand and denied those charges.
</P>
<P>
   She also lied to the independent counsel, an action that landed
her in prison after prosecutors pulled their original immunity deal
for her cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' lies about the tapes and the unknown portions that have
been tampered with, altered or erased were used by Sullivan to urge
Sporkin to rule against admissibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't rely upon the liar, the government's chief
witness!'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the hearing, the judge separated the trials of
co-defendants _ John Rosales and Sylvia Arce-Garcia, two Cisneros
aides at HUD _ who pleaded not guilty to the conspiracy charges
brought by Barrett. Sporkin severed the cases after Barrett
announced he would drop the charges against the aides within six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros is the second Clinton Cabinet member to face trial on
charges of unethical behavior. Former Agriculture Secretary Mike
Espy was acquitted in December 1998 on charges of bribery and
accepting illegal gratuities.

COMPANY SAYS ORDINARY PHONE CAN BE WEB BROWSER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Engineers at SpeechWorks International Inc. say
they've found a way to make any telephone work like an Internet Web
browser. But instead of pointing and clicking with a computer
mouse, users of the company's SpeechSite software could do their
on-line shopping or researching merely using voice commands.
</P>
<P>
   The product will hit the market late this year. Open Market
Inc., a leading maker of Internet retailing software from
Burlington, Mass., has struck a deal to customize SpeechSite for
use with Open Market software. This will make it easy for hundreds
of Internet retailers to add speech capability to their sites.
</P>
<P>
   SpeechSite, which will sell for $50,000 to $150,000, is a
software interface that will enable existing Web sites to recognize
voice commands. ``It's a do-it-yourself speech version of a Web
site,'' said SpeechWorks chief executive Stuart Patterson, whose
company is in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   SpeechSite will let Web surfers visit their favorite sites
without using a computer. For example, a bank could use SpeechSite
to voice-enable its Web site. A customer could telephone the bank
and have access to all of the features on the bank's Web site,
driven by voice commands instead of a keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can say, not only look at our Web site, but also call our
speech site and ask for information,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   A caller to a SpeechSite service will hear a recorded voice
telling him which options are available. Each option is similar to
a hyperlink on a Web page. But instead of pushing buttons, the
caller will simply say which option he wants. The options are
designed to be simple and easy to remember, so that regular callers
won't have to listen to them over and over again. Indeed, the
software allows the caller to speak at any time, interrupting the
instructions to go directly to the desired service.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson says SpeechSite will also make it easy for companies
to create speech-controlled services, because SpeechSite is linked
to the firm's existing customer databases. There's no need to
duplicate the services, because the Web page and the
speech-controlled service both connect to the same data and merely
present it in different formats.
</P>
<P>
   Open Market's vice president of marketing Jeffrey Bussgang said
customers who shop regularly at particular Web sites will find it
easy to use SpeechSite, because its voice commands are much the
same as the links on the company's Web page. In effect, they'll be
able to ``see'' the Web page in their mind's eye as they're being
talked through the SpeechSite. ``To be able to have that visual
image in your head while you're navigating by voice . . . is
extremely powerful and exciting,'' Bussgang said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a terrific idea,'' said William Meisel, president
of TMA Associates in Tarzana, Calif., a market research firm
specializing in speech-control software products. Meisel said
SpeechWorks and other companies have had only modest success with
speech-controlled telephone products. But he said SpeechWorks may
have found a clever way around this, by designing a system that
works like the World Wide Web, which is now routinely used by about
100 million people in North America.

ARMSTRONG CLINGS TO YELLOW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-FLOUR, France _ For the fifth day in a row, American Lance
Armstrong held on to the leader's yellow jersery in the Tour de
France.
</P>
<P>
   And for the second year in a row, the topic of drugs was raised
at the world's most prestigious cycling race.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong rode aggressively Friday but didn't risk any
breakaways over the hilly, 126-mile 12th stage from Saint-Galmier
to Saint-Flour in the Massif Centrale region of France. Spaniard
David Etxebarria left the pack going up the final climb, 14 miles
from the finish, and won in 4 hours 53 minutes 50 seconds. He was
26 seconds ahead of Frenchman Francois Simon and 12 minutes ahead
of most of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   So it was a good day for second-time Tour participant
Etxebarria, who had never won a stage and will celebrate his 26th
birthday next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't a good day for Armstrong. Despite the fact he
extended his comfortable overall lead over Abraham Olano by two
seconds to 7 minutes 44 seconds, Armstrong once again was embroiled
in drug talk.
</P>
<P>
   French racer Christophe Bassons, who has repeatedly spoken out
against drugs and has been writing a daily diary in a French
newspaper, quit the race before Friday's stage, claiming he had
been told by other riders to keep quiet. Bassons had written
Thursday that Armstrong had suggested he drop out.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong told reporters in the morning, ``I told him there is a
right way and wrong way of dealing with this and that he should
just worry about himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's race became a subplot to a doping controversy in
which the entire Festina team was thrown out of the race and six
other teams withdrew. (Bassons is one of three Festina riders who
tested negative). The drug story persisted over the winter and
reached a crescendo last month when the winner of last year's Tour,
Marco Pantani, was bounced from the Tour of Italy for testing
postive with a high count of red blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   The Tour de France has stepped up its drug testing this year and
has thus far conducted three sets of random tests. Armstrong's US
Postal Service team was among 40 riders tested Friday, all of whom
were negative.
</P>
<P>
   But the leader has been a target of skeptical French press
coverage, where he has been called ``Hallucinating Armstrong'' and
``from another planet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible that they print this. Why do they print
this?'' Armstrong told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The US Postal Service team's director of operations, Dan Osipow,
said that despite all the talk of drugs, Armstrong doesn't consider
it a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's focused on winning the race, and nothing is going to get
in the way of that,'' Osipow said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's lead is causing the American press corps here to
swell. It is a headache for them _ in terms of finding hotel rooms
in already booked small villages_ and for Tour organizers. ``We
usually don't give out credentials in the middle of the Tour, but
we do make exceptions,'' said assistant press officer Sophie Del
Rizzo. At the beginning of the three-week Tour July 3, credentials
had been issued to 750 print journalists, only 15 of whom were
American. Del Rizzo said she expects to have a dozen more requests
from American journalists by the end of next week. Such is the draw
of the yellow jersey . . . Friday marked the first time the town of
Saint-Flour (pop. 10,000) was a host city to finish a Tour stage.
The honor, which attracts thousands of tourists and garners
national attention, does not come cheaply or easily. A city must
pay about $42,000 to host the start of a stage, $75,000 for the
finish, and $116,000 for both . . . Addendum to Wednesday's
spectator story: The fan with the camera who ran in front of
Guiseppe Guerini, almost costing the Italian a stage win, went to
the team's hotel that night to apologize and shake Guerini's hand.
The case is closed, according to race director Jean-Marie LeBlanc .
. . Correction: Tyler Hamilton's bruise from last week is under his
left (not right) eye.

FRANCO DE VITA EXPLORES NEW TERRITORY IN `IGUAL' 
</HEADLINE>
 VITA-MUSIC-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It probably isn't a coincidence that ``Nada Es
Igual,'' the title of Franco De Vita's seventh studio album, means
``nothing is the same.'' The 45-year-old troubadour seems
determined to shake things up this time around.
</P>
<P>
   The Venezuelan singer/songwriter has been a Latin-music mainstay
for more than a decade, with a penchant for piano-based ballads and
socially conscious paeans that straddle the border between pop and
rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nada Es Igual'' is his first offering after a three-year
layoff following the acclaimed, acoustic-flavored ``Fuera de Esta
Mundo.'' And while De Vita's songwriting prowess is as sharp and
vivid as always _ even Ricky Martin has covered some of his tunes _
the musical textures are completely different. Bachata rhythms and
splashy Latin horns replace the jazzy brass section and arena-rock
guitar solos that De Vita usually employs.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is immediately apparent. The album opens with
``Si Tu No Estas,'' a moving confessional in which the protagonist
faces life alone. But while the song begins as a straightforward
ballad, it's soon laced with Spanish guitars. By the time De Vita's
smooth voice hits the chorus, a jaunty horn section kicks in, and
the mood is completely transformed as the song becomes a
understated salsa.
</P>
<P>
   His exploration with different rhythms and textures is exciting,
making this his own little ``Graceland.'' He's never been in a rut,
but he's never seemed this eager to venture to new musical
territories before. It adds up to one of the most intriguing
releases in a career full of fine albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Te Recordare'' features a distinctive reggae groove, with a
Jamaican-style rap offered by Charlie Rou. Bachata king Juan Luis
Guerra co-produces the lovely ``Te Veo Venir Soledad,'' and the
gentle percussion and lonesome harmonica add an extra layer of
melancholy to the winsome lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   That is one thing about the disc: De Vita's songs continually
circle around the subject of loneliness, which makes you wonder if
everything's OK in the guy's personal life.
</P>
<P>
   But things are brighter lyrically _ somewhat _ on the dazzling
``Traigo Una Pena,'' which throws acoustic guitars, horns, burbling
percussion and all-star salseros Gilberto Santo Rosa, Cheo
Feliciano and Victor Manuelle into a vibrant stew that is
thoroughly contagious. De Vita's free-wheeling vocal is delightful,
as he trades off lines with his guest stars.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the genre-busting going on, it's not a complete
world-beat travelogue. The title song and ``Cuento Con Maria'' both
use Beatles-esque harmonies, with the latter even tossing in some
mind-bending chord progressions that seem very '60s. De Vita is a
boomer-aged rocker at heart, after all.  &QL;

BLUSTERY COURSE CONTINUES TO WINNOW BRITISH OPEN FIELD

<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Perhaps, as promised, this major
championship crucible will reveal the cream of the golf world by
Saturday night. If so, it will be whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing with more bluster than the wind tearing through
Carnoustie Golf Club from the North Sea has been the players'
reaction to this 7,361-yard funhouse with its skyscraper rough,
shoestring fairways, and manhole bunkers. Between complaints, many
of the game's most prominent names have been sent drifting out of
here like dead leaves in an autumn gust. Which describes the
conditions here in County Angus on a tame day.
</P>
<P>
   While we're still waiting for greatness to assert itself, the
leaderboard looks as fluky as the climate, a veritable Who's He? of
golf. France's Jean Van de Velde, whose name sounds as if he should
be making action films, fired the round of the tournament, a
3-under-par 68, and assumed sole control of first place at 1-over
143.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde, a 33-year-old journeyman who has won once in eight
years on the European Tour _ the 1993 Roma Masters _ carded four
birdies against a lone bogey in posting matching nines of 34.
Included were two birdies and two pars on the last four holes, a
stretch in which he surrendered four strokes to par during his
first-round 75.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday was a tough finish,'' he said. ``It drains you a lot
to be out there all day, and the holes are playing at least as
difficult downwind as they are into the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   So what in the world is he doing up in the stratosphere?
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard there's always a first time,'' he said. ``I know it's
a major championship, but it's only a golf tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Right behind Van de Velde is the equally well-known Argentine
Angel Cabrera, who shot a 69 for a 144 and actually benefited from
the wind _ it blew in his par putt that seemed to have died on the
lip at the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very fast putt and the wind was pushing,'' said
Cabrera, 29, who has won 15 tournaments in South America but none
in four years on the European Tour, though he was runner-up in the
Irish Open two weeks ago. ``So I touch it and I thought that it was
in. And it was a little short. I was very surprised. And then the
wind came and threw it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde and Cabrera supplanted Thursday's one-day wonder,
Rodney Pampling. The only man to match par in the first round
returned to his proper place in obscurity with an 86_157. He earned
a place in history as well, becoming the only first-round leader to
miss the cut in the 128 renditions of this event.
</P>
<P>
   Lurking behind the vaunted 1-2 punch are some names you might
actually recognize.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden's Jesper Parnevik, twice a runner-up in this event and a
shoo-in to make the European Ryder Cup team that will face the
United States at The Country Club Sept. 26-28, came in at 71_145.
He shared second before bogeying 17, then salvaged par for the last
hole and the round when he chipped from behind the green to within
5 feet and sank the putt.
</P>
<P>
   Like his colleagues, Parnevik considered his round a survival
test, but he meant it literally. He's running a fever, his hand is
bothering him, the heather is wreaking havoc with his allergies,
and he almost walked off the course after five holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt terrible,'' he said. ``I was sneezing constantly. I
just had to time putts and shots between my sneezes. I thought I
was going to shoot 90 or something. To shoot 71 in the end is
beyond my dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he can catch pneumonia overnight and run away with the
title.
</P>
<P>
   The group at 146 includes Greg Norman (70) and Tiger Woods (72),
both poised to make a weekend run. Patrik Sjoland of Sweden (74)
joins them at 4 over, and 1997 British king Justin Leonard (74) is
among those another stroke back.
</P>
<P>
   Norman's round typified the competitors' lament about this
course. After a run of three straight birdies from the 12th through
the 14th, he came to 17 alone at the top at 1 over. But he
proceeded to crisscross the notorious Burma Burn, even fanning on
his second shot, and took a triple-bogey 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``My tee shot was basically three paces off the fairway, and I
never moved the ball with my second shot,'' said the two-time
British champion. ``I don't think hitting a tee shot off the
fairway by 9 feet deserves something like that. In my estimation, I
don't think that's the way the game of golf should be played.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Woods, who bogeyed two of the last three holes, may
be as much masochist as maestro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always enjoyed playing in terrible conditions, rain,
wind,'' he said. ``You have to be more creative. You have to use
your repertoire of shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Those sentiments weren't shared by a host of luminaries whose
repertoires have been canceled or rendered irrelevant for the
weekend. The likes of world No. 2 David Duval (75) and two-time US
Open champion Lee Janzen (74) are hanging around only because the
cut for the top 70 and ties fell at an astronomical 12-over 154.
Gone are Phil Mickelson (76_155), Nick Faldo (79_157), Masters
champion Jose Maria Olazabal (79_157), and Billy Mayfair (80_161),
among others.
</P>
<P>
   At least they have nothing to complain about. They've escaped.

<P>
   AKSU, China _ South of this one-time camel stop on the Silk
Road, bulldozers and men with spades flounder in the wickedly fine
sand, leveling dunes into fields in China's own version of the
taming of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, a stretch of the Taklamakan Desert will be transformed
into an oasis of cotton and rice. And another enclave of ethnic
Chinese will spring up in the mainly Muslim frontier region of
Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
   The men and machines are the advance guard of the Xinjiang
Production and Construction Corps, a huge, little-known
organization that for nearly half a century has led China's drive
to settle _ and secure _ this alien region with a turbulent history
and China's most violent separatist movement.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps, as it is known, is practically a world unto itself.
From scratch, it has built whole cities, and hundreds of farms and
factories producing more than one-third of Xinjiang's cotton and
other goods. With workers and their families numbering 2.4 million,
97 percent of them ethnic Chinese, it runs its own university and
television station, its own militias and prison camps.
</P>
<P>
   In the tradition of settlers anywhere, Corps leaders look on
their works with an exalted sense of achievement _ and seemingly
little understanding of how indigenous people, the dwindling
majority of Muslim Uighurs and others, might respond to the
onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made towns and cities where there was nothing but a vast
wasteland, blank spots on the map,'' said Wang Guizhen, the deputy
commissar. ``That is a source of great pride for the Corps.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Uighurs want economic progress, and have benefited from
regional development, they worry about their culture, and many
resent the Chinese domination of politics, water resources and
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Corps says it's here to help local development, but look
at us, we're still poor,'' said a Uighur teacher. ``Uighurs see the
Corps as a military agency. They don't want us, and we don't want
to work under them.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Corps, by contrast, unabashedly recite its
mission, laid down at its inception in the heyday of militant
communism in the early 1950s: ``To develop Xinjiang, defend the
nation's borders and protect social stability.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Chinese Communists gained control of the northwestern
frontier in 1949, they felt that special measures were required to
hold it. All desert and mountain, Xinjiang accounts for one-sixth
of China's land area, yet even now has a population of little more
than 17 million. Over the last two centuries, it has been the scene
of repeated revolts.
</P>
<P>
   To tame this wild land, the Corps was created as a paramilitary
organization of cashiered soldiers, convicts and volunteers. In
this landscape of scorching summers and sub-zero winters, the early
pioneers endured hardships that are now legendary in China, living
in branch-covered holes and pulling plows with their own shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Some fought die-hard remnants of the defeated Chinese
Nationalists. ``In those days, we held a hoe in one hand and a gun
in the other,'' Wang said in an interview in the provincial capital
of Urumqi.
</P>
<P>
   The mythic struggles of the early pioneers are now being honored
in a dramatic television series, filmed this summer on location and
featuring the adventures of 8,000 female soldiers who were sent to
join the men in the desert in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Corps militias and armed police sometimes aid the
army and civil authorities in quelling riots. But the Corps'
primary contribution to security is more basic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, `defending' became more a matter of occupying real
estate than of bearing arms,'' said James D. Seymour, a China
expert at Columbia University who has studied the Corps. ``It is a
corporation whose purpose is to colonize.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Corps as a spearhead, the number of Chinese in Xinjiang
has grown dramatically. In 1949, there were just 300,000 in the
region, but by 1997, more than 6 million Chinese made up 38 percent
of the total population, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
   Uighurs numbered 8 million, or 47 percent of the total, while
1.2 million Kazakhs and numerous smaller groups rounded out the
total.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the children of the early pioneers have taken over their
parents' jobs, supplemented by a stream of Chinese migrants. But
Corps leaders assert that their overall numbers have largely
stabilized, with new arrivals offset by the return home of
retirees.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps operates in parallel with the provincial authorities,
reporting directly to Beijing. Over the decades, it has created
hundreds of enclaves of Chinese culture within the Islamic Xinjiang
of exotic bazaars, bearded men in skull caps and women in scarves
or veils.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese settlements are concentrated in an arc along the
western border, which in the 1960s and 1970s was _ in Chinese eyes
_ menaced by the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Today that border is with three countries: Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The military menace has diminished as
China has fostered good ties with those governments. But a revival
of cross-border ties among Uighurs and related ethnic groups may be
promoting Uighur nationalism, and Chinese authorities say they have
uncovered weapons smuggled from Central Asia to Uighur separatists
in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
   The showcase of the Chinese effort to bind this vast territory
closer to the rest of China is Shihezi, west of Urumqi, an
all-Chinese model city of 220,000 people, surrounded by Chinese
farming towns.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 174 Corps farming complexes is a Chinese stronghold.
Driven by zeal as much as by economics, the Corps still reclaims
more than 100,000 acres from the desert each year, usually
expanding from existing farms.
</P>
<P>
   For decades this was a project powered by the paramilitary,
communal nature of the Corps. In the new, more market-oriented
China, even the Corps is trying to transform itself into a
corporate conglomerate, battling low farm prices and obsolete
factories by avidly seeking foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Its No. 1 Agricultural Division, with large holdings in Aksu
Prefecture, has even sold shares on the Shanghai exchange to raise
money for new desert clearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pushing back the desert,'' enthused Yang Haihan, vice
commander of the division. ``We are improving the environment.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In centuries past, Aksu was one of the main Uighur oases of
southern Xinjiang. Here, from the desert floor, snow-capped peaks
of the Tianshan Mountains are visible year-round, the source of the
river waters that permit agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent tour, the ethnic divide was evident, along with the
formidable achievements of the Corps. But, accompanied at all times
by several officials, including one who videotaped every encounter,
a foreign reporter was not permitted to have private conversations
with Uighurs or ordinary Corps workers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 1.8 million people crowd into the greater Aksu area,
surrounded by desert. More than three-fourths of them are Uighurs,
mostly living in mud-brick villages where they farm cotton, grains
and melons. The Corps has 264,000 people in the area, divided
between Aksu City and numerous farms.
</P>
<P>
   Aksu City has the look and rhythms of mainstream China: On a
summer evening, pop music blares from the multistory Corps
recreation building and hundreds of Chinese couples and retirees
gather to practice the fox trot.
</P>
<P>
   In the Uighur corner of the city, a modest minaret pokes into
the sky, radios play wailing Uighur ballads and shops offer stacks
of flat breads.
</P>
<P>
   Officials insist that all groups in Aksu are living in harmony.
But on the streets, too, are government signs saying ``Oppose
National Separatism'' and ``Defend Social Stability.'' Here and in
other Uighur centers, with an unknown degree of public support,
festers a violent Uighur movement that seeks an independent East
Turkistan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, according to an article in the Xinjiang Daily, police
in Aksu Prefecture ``wiped out a number of terrorist gangs,
confiscated a number of firearms, demolition devices and
reactionary propaganda materials and discovered a number of
underground-scripture lecturing places and underground
military-skill schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Xinjiang's political leaders have spoken publicly about the
``grim situation'' and ``fierce struggle'' against separatism in
the province. So far this year, the executions of at least 18
Uighurs for bombings, murders of officials, arms smuggling and
other crimes have been reported in newspapers; hundreds of Uighurs,
perhaps thousands, are in prison for political offenses.
</P>
<P>
   A June 2 article in a Hong Kong newspaper with close ties to the
Beijing government says that to fight the ``heinous'' armed
separatist movement in Xinjiang, economic development must speed up
and Chinese immigration via the Corps should accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose is to adjust the proportions of the populations of
different ethnic groups in this region, especially in its southern
part,'' said the article in the newspaper Ta Kung Pao. It is
unclear whether the article reflects a proposal under serious
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, the deputy commissar, said development contributes to
stability by helping all Xinjiang's people.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, living standards have improved with regional
development, even if the Chinese remain better off on average, and
many Uighurs and members of other minority groups benefit from
government projects. In Urumqi and Aksu, Uighur professionals are
visible on the streets, working easily with Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   But many Uighurs have a deeper fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all aware that Inner Mongolia is now only about 14
percent Mongol,'' said Dru C. Gladney, dean of the Asia-Pacific
Center for Security Studies in Honolulu. ``They just don't want
that to happen to Xinjiang. On the other hand, they do want
development.''

 &HT;    JUDGE REDUCES MURDER SENTENCE FOR BROTHER OF FORMER MEXICAN
PRESIDENT
 &HT;    554. Moving on (i) international wires.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY An appeals court judge in Mexico on Friday nearly
cut in half the 50-year homicide sentence given to Raul Salinas,
the brother of former Mexican president Carlos Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction in sentence was the latest twist in the legacy of
Carlos Salinas, who lives in self-exile in Ireland and is widely
blamed by Mexicans for leading the country into a devastating
economic crisis and spreading corruption during his 1988 to 1994
presidential term.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Salinas who used to direct a national supplemental food
agency was sentenced in January to a 50-year term for arranging the
1994 killing of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, one of his political
rivals within Mexico's Revolutionary Institutional Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Judge Tomas Hernandez Franco reduced Salinas' sentence
to 27 years and six months. No reasons for the reduction were
immediately announced, but Salinas' lawyers had argued that
evidence against their client was weak because some witnesses were
paid and evidence fabricated an argument some legal experts here
said was not far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   Also, some legal experts say the 50-year sentence given to
Salinas exceeded the norm in similar cases. Salinas is appealing
his conviction before Mexico's Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's decision was announced just one day after another
Salinas court case was successfully appealed.
</P>
<P>
   The imprisoned Raul Salinas is currently under investigation for
taking millions of dollars in bribes from drug lords. The case is
bolstered by a Swiss investigation into whether $114 million
deposited in Swiss bank accounts by Raul Salinas came from bribes.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday Switzerland's highest court ruled in favor of an
appeal by Salinas' lawyers and found that Swiss prosecutors acted
beyond their reach when they confiscated Salinas' accounts last
year. The court said only local Swiss governments could freeze such
assets.
</P>
<P>
   The money, which Salinas argues is an investment fund, will
remain frozen pending further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Mexicans' wrath is reserved more for Salinas' alleged
misuse of public funds he controlled and allegations that he took
millions of dollars in bribes from drug lords he aided.
</P>
<P>
   But his murder conviction pleased many here because the Salinas
family is so reviled and because of the perception that powerful
Mexicans' crimes usually go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Salinas, who once was hailed by the international elite
as a democratic reformer, is frequently mocked in Mexico in
cartoons, and dolls exaggerate his bald pate and have dollars
clutched in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Carlos Salinas caused a stir in Mexico when he made his
first visit since he left in the country in 1995. He told reporters
at a news conference that one of his motives was to check on his
brother's welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The visit may have also yielded positive results for Raul
Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Salinas submitted a petition requesting that his brother
be transferred to a lower-security prison. The request was granted
after it was reviewed by a chain of command that led up to the
administration of current president Ernesto Zedillo, according to
Mexican news reports.

REMADE SONATA A CONTENDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - With its all-new Sonata, Hyundai has arrived. Finally.
</P>
<P>
   Best-known for selling inexpensive cars with short life spans,
the Korean automaker takes a major leap forward with the redesigned
Sonata. With a new V-6 engine, an attractive new body design,
fairly roomy interior and a sub-$20,000 price tag fully loaded with
luxury features, the Sonata presents a formidable entry in the
broad, competitive class of midsize sedans.
</P>
<P>
   The midsize class is the heart of the market, where Toyota
Camry, Honda Accord and Ford Taurus duke it out every year for
laurels as best-selling automobile. And there are lots of other
cars, ranging from the Chevy Lumina to the Mercedes C-Class, vying
for family-car buyers.
</P>
<P>
   So what secret weapon does Sonata bring onto the field? Price,
for one. As Hyundai's flagship, the Sonata is not cheap, but it
does offer considerable dollar value for those attempting to
finance a new car on a limited budget.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Hyundai is offering the best warranty coverage in the
industry. The powertrain is covered for 10 years or 100,000, and
the entire car is covered bumper-to-bumper for five years or 60,000
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, part of the reasoning here is to counter Hyundai's
reputation for spotty reliability. Many people have unpleasant
memories of self-destructive Excels, so the warranty protection
goes far to assuage those fears.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Hyundai dealers are having a great year, and
a number of would-be dealers are standing in line to snag
franchises. One lure is the new Sonata; another is the upcoming
Santa Fe sport-utility vehicle. And, of course, that warranty.
</P>
<P>
   Sonata is not only the best Hyundai yet, it's also a good sedan
when compared with the competition. I found it to be roadworthy and
likeable, well-equipped and enjoyable to drive.
</P>
<P>
   The test car was a top-of-the-line GLS model with a load of
standard equipment, including power windows, locks and mirrors; V-6
engine; automatic transmission; 100-watt stereo with CD; four-wheel
power disc brakes with anti-lock; low-profile performance tires on
good-looking rims; side air bags and seat-belt pretensioners (rare
in this class of car); cruise control; and a host of other goodies.
</P>
<P>
   The only major option was a leather-seating/power-driver-seat
package, priced at $1,200. Even at that, the total fell
significantly below the $20,000 barrier, probably $5,000 or $6,000
lower than its Japanese and U.S. competitors, comparably equipped.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for the base-model Sonata start at just over $15,000,
with well-equipped models coming in at just a few thousand more.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior styling is conservative but distinctive, looking
low and sporty, with a large cabin area, and sculpted hood and
trunk. One styling clinker is the aluminum strip across the lip of
the trunk, with Sonata embossed in block letters. It's dated and
ugly.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is reasonably roomy with decent head and leg room.
Two inches have been added to the overall width compared with the
last Sonata, and it's readily apparent inside. The styling is,
again, conservative but seemed well-made and properly designed.
</P>
<P>
   The ersatz-wood trim around the console is pretty bad. I don't
think any actual tree product ever looked like this stuff. Hyundai
needs to bury its fake-wood supply and stick with something a bit
more realistic. Look at the interiors of some new Volkswagens for
the kind of surfaces and textures that can replace phony wood.
Forever, I hope.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the interior was pleasant and comfortable, more so
than expected, with nothing that felt cramped or minimalistic.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonata has a smooth, competent ride, though serious road
irregularities will throw it off course. Handling is very good, as
long as you don't meet up with any of those irregularities.
Steering is responsive, and the four-wheel disc brakes stop on a
dime.
</P>
<P>
   The new V-6 cruises nicely, though hard acceleration will make
it roar. The power's pretty good once you get it up in the revs,
but it will bog down at low engine speeds. Compounding this
problem, the automatic transmission seemed reluctant to downshift
unless I pressed hard on the accelerator, making the engine roar
aggressively. I would have much preferred the available stick
shift.
</P>
<P>
   A pretty beefy 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine is the base unit,
cranking 149 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   One thing to consider with the Sonata is that it may not hold
its resale value, the way Camrys or Accords do, because of
Hyundai's spotty past. Time will tell whether Sonata is indeed the
dawning of a new day for Hyundai, or just another false start. &QL;

JEWS' HEROIC ROLE IN BOSNIAN WAR REVEALED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ There were 38 checkpoints, four
armies, and six militias between the besieged city of Sarajevo and
freedom during the long agony of the Bosnian civil war.
</P>
<P>
   On the high ground, Serb artillery and snipers tore at the
fabric of historic Sarajevo at will, terrorizing the residents and
earning the contempt of the Western world. In the city, Muslims and
Croats hunkered down as uneasy allies, sometimes fighting each
other as well as the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Invisible amid it all were the Jews, a once-thriving Bosnian
ethnic minority whose numbers had shrunk to a few hundred under a
succession of Nazi, Communist, and Yugoslav regimes. Alone among
the resident ethnic communities of the besieged city, they could
negotiate the perilous route from the embattled Bosnian capital,
through Croatia, to the Adriatic port of Split. There, the refugees
could reach the refugee camps of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   What the Jews did is just beginning to emerge, nearly four years
after the end of the siege. Details of how they did it still are
under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a little bit of diplomacy, a little bit of bribe, and
some very good Jewish connections,'' said Jakob Finci, one of four
leaders of the Jewish community who led frequent clandestine
convoys in and out of the city during the war, carrying an
estimated 2,500 Sarajevans to safety and returning with medicines
and other essential supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key was to be absolutely honest with all three sides,
always to do exactly what we said,'' said Finci. ``Finally they
understood we were working for all the ethnic groups of Sarajevo.
It was not always easy to get the trust of people who sometimes
were war criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Absolute honesty notwithstanding, the Jews drove out of Sarajevo
in convoys of two or three trucks each, with different documents in
different pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you accidentally showed the Muslims you had a special
permit from the Serbs, or accidentally showed the Serbs you had a
special permit from the Croats, you could be shot on the spot,'' he
said. ``Sometimes the Muslims would say, `Don't take this guy, the
Serbs will arrest him.' And sometimes the Serbs would say, `Please
take these two guys out for us.' But always it was an open game.''
</P>
<P>
   The convoys were organized and operated by La Benevolencija, a
mutual aid society founded by the Jews in 1894. The society also
operated a soup kitchen that remained open throughout the siege,
except on Judaism's three holiest days. Regardless of the siege, an
especially nice table was laid weekly on Saturday, the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now everyone in Sarajevo knows what is Shabbat,'' Finci said.
``It's when there's a good lunch in the Jewish community center.''
The sabbath crowd still averages around 300 people, he said;
``Eighty are Jews, the rest are friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Something similar happened in the Sunday School the Jews started
during the siege. After the second Sunday, a Jewish child said,
`Can I bring my best friend next week? We've spent the last six
months in a shelter.' '' By the end of the siege, there were 20
Jewish children in the school, and 30 best friends.
</P>
<P>
   Passover, when the traditional seder marking the Hebrews' last
night in Egyptian slavery is held at night, had to be observed in
the daytime, lest Serb gunners fire at glimmers of light from the
synagogue in the midst of the darkened city. But this, too, was
turned into a celebration of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Kemal Kurspahic, who was editor-in-chief of Oslobodjenje, the
city's principal newspaper during the siege, attended the seder in
1993, in the hardest of times, a period when the paper was winning
an international reputation for never missing an edition despite
destruction of almost all its facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seder . . . was a huge community event, with leaders of
other religious communities there,'' said Kurspahic, who now is the
newspaper's correspondent in Washington. ``Especially the Passover
lunch, with all the traditional foods, in a city in need of
everything; it was a huge symbol of survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Symbolism aside, he said, ``the Jewish community did things
during the siege that really contributed to the survival of the
city: La Benevolencija's supply of medicine, especially.''
</P>
<P>
   During the siege, the Jews marked the 500th anniversary of the
expulsion of their ancestors from Spain when that country was
retaken from the Moors by Catholics. Many Jews ousted from Spain
resettled in North Africa, Greece, Turkey and the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The commemoration of the migration from Spain to the Balkans
``was a celebration of a spirit of diversity and of the ethnic
cultures of Bosnia,'' said Kurspahic. ``And with all their
experiences of the Second World War and the destruction of Jewish
people and heritage, there was a focus among them of saving people
who otherwise would have been condemned.''
</P>
<P>
   Finci, 55, was born in an Italian concentration camp just before
the end of World War II, making him the first member of his family
to be born outside of Sarajevo in 300 years. A prosperous lawyer
before the war, he now is director of the Soros Foundation's Open
Society Fund for Bosnia and a highly respected citizen of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the four wartime Jewish leaders is mayor of one of
the four municipalities of Sarajevo. But the other two have
emigrated, and Finci is afraid the days of the Jewish community
here may be numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Before World War II, when the population of Sarajevo was 60,000,
there were 12,000 Jews, he said. Only 2,000 returned after the
Holocaust, and half of those left for Israel in the late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the disintegration of Yugoslavia, there were
1,500, the number swelled somewhat by people who reclaimed their
Jewish identity rather than yield to pressure to declare themselves
Serbs or Croats. But 1,000 left during the war, and only 200
returned with the peace. Now, the migration of young people to
Israel is steady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even my own son,'' said Finci, in tone and expression at once
sad and proud.

MITCHELL ASKED TO TRY TO HELP RESTART IRISH PEACE PRCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British and Irish governments have asked former US
senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, who chaired negotiations that
brought about the now-stalled political settlement in Northern
Ireland, to meet informally with the various parties there to coax
them to find a new compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is scheduled to meet Tuesday at 10 Downing St. with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie
Ahern, as the two governments assess how to breathe life back into
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, that process was dealt its most serious blow since
the April 1998 signing of the Good Friday Agreement, presided over
by Mitchell. The Northern Ireland Assembly, which was supposed to
be the institution on which a new, more equitable society was
built, was suspended indefinitely when Protestant unionists refused
to form a power-sharing government with Catholic nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   The largest unionist party, the Ulster Unionists, boycotted the
session, saying it will not sit in a government with Sinn Fein, the
Irish Republican Army's political wing, until the IRA begins
disarming.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's patience is widely credited with winning respect from
the various parties in Northern Ireland, but it was his
decisiveness in setting a deadline that brought about the Good
Friday Agreement, which created the political institutions aimed at
ending the conflict that over 30 years has killed more than 3,500
people.
</P>
<P>
   Blair and Ahern have been less successful using deadlines in
trying to get the parties in Northern Ireland to compromise and
create a power-sharing government before the IRA begins to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, 65, who was in London Thursday to receive an award
from Queen Elizabeth, said he did not want to comment ahead of
Tuesday's meeting. But he issued a statement that said: ``The prime
ministers of the United Kingdom and of Ireland have invited me to
attend a meeting with them on Tuesday in London. I look forward to
discussing with them the current situation in Northern Ireland. If
the prime ministers conclude that I can usefully play a role at
this time, I will do all I can to be helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   The governments have decided that Mitchell might appeal directly
to the party leaders, especially David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the condition he not be identified, a spokesman for
Blair said Mitchell will be used ``more as an interlocutor, rather
than heading something up,'' such as a commission.
</P>
<P>
   Having given four years as an unpaid volunteer to the peace
process, Mitchell bade Belfast farewell in April 1998, saying he
needed to devote time to his Washington law practice to earn money
for his wife and his son, now 1 year old.
</P>
<P>
   Both London and Dublin are aware that Mitchell, given his
responsibilities, is not available for the full-time service he
previously gave.
</P>
<P>
   Blair spoke Friday by telephone with President Clinton for about
20 minutes, updating the president on the situation and about the
plans to use Mitchell as a troubleshooter, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   While each meeting between the parties and Blair and Ahern has
been high-profile, the two governments envision Mitchell being used
in a more low-key manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mitchell can do things behind the scenes, talking to people,''
said the Downing Street spokesman. ``We expect the temperatures to
dip a bit. We got to the stage where every time one of the prime
ministers engages with a party, it was called an Ulster summit.''

HEIRS HOPE FOR REVIVED INTEREST IN BUCKMINSTER FULLER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ Perhaps the most illuminating impression
one gets from a stroll through the Buckminster Fuller Institute, a
cramped warren of offices in the balcony of an old movie theater
here, is how familiar all the artifacts produced by this great
thinker seem today
</P>
<P>
   The geodesic domes, the Dymaxion maps, the tensegrity models and
octatrusses, all Fuller inventions that at one time seemed
radically new, have become ubiquitous in the late 20th century.
Though the terminology may still be obscure to some, his designs
are common in everything from playgrounds to giant shopping mall
roofs to soccer balls. Indeed, Fuller's clever geometric vocabulary
has so insinuated itself into the grammar of contemporary design
that it takes a few moments to realize that some of the objects at
the institute _ a Balinese woven basket, a turtle shell, a spiky
stuffed puffer fish _ that Fuller had collected and studied sprang
from sources other than his awesomely original mind.
</P>
<P>
   It is just as revealing, though, that one of the least familiar
images at the institute may be that of R. Buckminster Fuller
himself. The kindly-looking old man in a business suit with close
cropped white hair and thick glasses, the man who graced the cover
of Time magazine in 1964 as a towering genius and who was widely
known as Bucky, has slipped, much like the institute, from the
public's mind.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the reasons that Fuller's daughter, Allegra
Fuller Snyder, and his grandson, Jaime Snyder, are about to finish
transferring the huge archives at the institute, hundreds of boxes
of letters _ he seems to have saved nearly every one he ever wrote
or received _ manuscripts, photographs, blueprints and videotapes,
to Stanford University in Palo Alto after several years of planning
and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The donation seems unlikely to resuscitate Fuller to the cult
status he had when he wrote ``Operating Manual for Spaceship
Earth'' and was embraced by the Whole Earth Catalog and its
followers in the 1960s. But the family hopes the donation will
foster renewed interest in his extraordinary and at times deeply
subversive ideas about everything from home construction (he
designed a cheap prefabricated house that was suspended from a mast
in the 1920s) and automobiles (in the 1930s he made a three-wheeled
cigar-shaped car that went 120 mph on a 90-horsepower engine) to
political organization (he thought military expenditures a colossal
waste and felt governments generally frustrated a more even
distribution of wealth).
</P>
<P>
   In short, his descendants say it may again be time for people to
be exposed to a romantic visionary who had few commercial
instincts, little use for accepted wisdom and extraordinary
foresight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt he was surfing history in a sense, trying to
anticipate the trends,'' Ms. Snyder said. ``Now some of those waves
have come in. There's also a different kind of chemistry today,
especially among young people, and that opens doors to his thinking
once again.'' The intellectual exile into which Fuller's ideas
seemed to slide and the spark of new interest in his prodigious
work, which Stanford hopes to enhance by organizing and cataloging
his archives, is a commentary on shifting fashions in ideas.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he died in 1983 at 87, Fuller and his work were
already falling out of favor, Ms. Snyder said. He seemed out of
step with a time when there was suspicion of anyone who rejected
traditional thinking so cheerfully and thought in such grandiose
terms. The earth was almost too small a unit, and he frequently
spoke of the universe and man's place in it. His selfless creed was
that people should gather not wealth but information and knowledge
with the purpose of sharing it to make society more successful by
improving living standards.
</P>
<P>
   He hewed to an absolute ethic of technological efficiency, of
producing more with fewer resources, a motivation that created
astounding results but that he regarded as the minimum society
should expect if people liberated their minds as he had. In 1957 a
large geodesic dome auditorium was built so swiftly in Honolulu
that 22 hours after the parts were delivered a full house of
hundreds of people were happily taking in a concert.
</P>
<P>
   When Ronald Reagan became president and the country took a turn
to the right, Fuller became identified with the counterculture. Yet
Ms. Snyder and other experts on his work regard such a
characterization as misleading and argue that he was a victim of
the reaction against the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   E.J. Applewhite, who collaborated with Fuller on his two-volume
behemoth, ``Synergetics: Explorations in the Geometry of
Thinking,'' said that it was true that Fuller was even more radical
than many so-called 1960s radicals. But that had nothing to do with
his lifestyle, which was fairly conventional. He was from an old
New England family and, though twice thrown out of Harvard as a
youth, nearly always wore business suits and spent much of his
career teaching at universities. His grandson, Jaime Snyder,
recalled being taught table manners by Fuller, a staunch New
England Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   What was so unusual about Fuller, Applewhite said, was that he
was completely apolitical and believed not in philosophies but in
principles for problem-solving. What he disliked were impediments
to technological solutions of common problems. Chief among those
impediments, in his view, were tradition and cultural legacies,
which thwarted the clear-eyed thinking needed to invent efficient
ways of improving people's lives. He said change was not only good
but also essential to saving the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I am,'' he once said. ``I know that I am not
a category. I am not a thing _ a noun. I seem to be a verb, an
evolutionary process, an integral function of the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His free thinking appealed to a new generation eager to break
old intellectual models and enticed by the liberating promise of
all kinds of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people, dropouts, loved him because he said you don't
have to earn a living,'' said Applewhite, who collaborated with
Fuller for several decades even though he had spent his career
working for the CIA, which Fuller loathed. ``But these people
generally ignored the rest of what he said, which was that you have
to just do what has to be done. Just see what the needs of society
are, and fill them.''
</P>
<P>
   His thinking was so eccentric that he was often regarded as
something of a crackpot until his ideas started to prove themselves
and found their way into common use. No one ever took him up on his
idea of covering Manhattan with a dome, for instance (he believed
the savings in snow removal alone would pay for the structure), but
the U.S. pavilion at Expo '67 in Montreal was in a memorably giant
geodesic dome and his octatrusses, a lightweight, strong honeycomb
of a structure that can span great distances, are common at
shopping malls and convention centers.
</P>
<P>
   He ultimately had 25 patents, wrote 28 books, received 47
honorary doctorates and was awarded the Presidential Medal of
Freedom. He invented not only objects (he called them artifacts)
but words as well with an eye to literalness. For instance, he
called people earthians, referred to sunsets as sunclipses and
prefaced the names of many of his inventions with the term
Dymaxion, a combination of dynamic, maximum and tension.
Globalization, now a popular concept, was an idea he championed,
along with the development of wind, solar and wave power. In turn,
he became a name: When scientists discovered a new type of carbon
molecule in 1985 that resembles his geodesic dome, they called it a
buckyball.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his life, ever eager to share his vision, he
recorded a 42-hour program on video, ``Everything I Know,'' a
precise catalog organizing his thoughts. It typified his
earnestness and his unshakable confidence that mankind could
accomplish any practical task, assuming people had the patience to
sit through the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his disciples have continued to work on his ideas, and
in Europe he still is a celebrity, at least in some circles. There
is a huge exhibition on him, ``Your Private Sky: R. Buckminster
Fuller and the Art of Design Science,'' at the Zurich Museum of
Design in Switzerland. Ms. Snyder said no show of that breadth has
ever been mounted by a museum in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His descendants are hoping that the transfer of his archives to
Stanford, where they will be more accessible, will allow a new
generation to discover Fuller. His grandson said he believed Fuller
represented a positive, optimistic side of the '60s that has been
obscured by current cultural debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The utopianism he stood for was emblematic of the '60s,''
Snyder said. ``I think Bucky, in the best sense, really believed in
progress. In that sense, the whole '60s thing hasn't gone away.
It's sort of gone underground, and some of these ideas may be
coming to the surface again.''

   CONGRESS-F-22 (Washington) _ The House will vote next week to
cut off funds to produce the $70 billion Air Force F-22, an act
unprecedented in modern times, House leaders said Friday. By Tim
Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-TARIFFS (Washington) _ The House is to vote and likely
pass a bill to eliminate duties on apparel and textiles from
Africa, if the countries commit to economic reform and improve
human rights. The measure, which the Senate has yet to take up, has
divided the black caucus, some of whose members fear the move will
hurt business here. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-HEALTH (Washington) _ Despite all the talk about
protecting people in health maintenance organizations, most people
in HMOs would derive no tangible benefit from many of the
consumer-protection standards approved by the Senate this week as
part of a comprehensive bill to define patients' rights, lawyers
and health policy experts said. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   NY-HEAT (New York) _ With summer trundling its twin siege
engines of heat and humidity back to the metropolitan region for a
prolonged weekend assault, New Yorkers braced for near record
temperatures and hoped to avoid another severe blackout. The city
put its crisis management services on prolonged alert, opening its
Emergency Operation Center, as its combined bunker for police, fire
and medical crisis teams is known, as well as special cooling
centers for anyone who might be afflicted by the heat. By Neil
MacFarquhar.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-VERDICT _ Microsoft Corp. won a convincing courtroom
victory Friday when a jury in Bridgeport, Conn., found that the
company had not violated federal antitrust laws in its dealings
with a small local software maker. The private suit in Connecticut
has no direct impact on the government's antitrust case against
Microsoft. But antitrust experts said the verdict would certainly
hearten the Microsoft legal team in Washington. By Steve Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-WILDWEST (Aksu, China) _ South of this one-time camel stop
on the Silk Road, bulldozers and men with spades flounder in the
wickedly fine sand, leveling dunes into fields in China's own
version of the taming of the West. Soon, a stretch of the
Taklamakan Desert will be transformed into an oasis of cotton and
rice. And another enclave of ethnic Chinese will spring up in the
mainly Muslim frontier region of Xinjiang. By Erik Eckholm.

<P>
   PBS-DONOR-LISTS (Washington) _ The Corporation for Public
Broadcasting said Friday it was trying to determine how many public
television stations had swapped donor lists with the Democratic
National Committee after reports that stations in Washington, New
York and Boston had done so for years. By Katherine Q. Seeyle.
</P>
<P>
   WVA-AGED (Dunbar, W.Va.) _ West Virginia has surpassed Florida
as the state with the oldest per capita residents in the union, and
no one knows this better than Ken Hechler, the 84-year-old elected
secretary of state who has decided he can be the wave of the
future: he's running for his old House seat that he retired from in
the '70s. By Francis X. Clines.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ When ``Gone With the Wind in the Vatican'' first appeared
in bookstores in February, few people noticed the account of
intrigue, homosexuality and corruption within the Vatican
bureaucracy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, however, did pay heed, and readers instantly
followed. Ever since a church tribunal ordered one of the authors,
a priest who is a retired Vatican official, to cease publication
and explain himself before church judges, the book has become a
runaway best seller. It has tantalized readers, infuriated Roman
Catholic Church officials and turned the one acknowledged author
(the others remain anonymous), the Rev. Luigi Marinelli, into a
publishing cause celebre who fears he will be stripped of his right
to say Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Marinelli did not appear before the church tribunal
that had summoned him, via a letter written in Latin, and ordered
him to remove the offending book from stores and stop new printing
runs, ``ne damna graviore forte provocentur'' (to prevent further
serious damage). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I answer?'' Marinelli said. He explained he could not
recant because ``that would be a lie,'' and that he personally has
no authority to remove the books from stores or prevent new
printings or foreign translations. Neither does the Vatican, for
that matter, although it can try to sue the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Italian newspapers have gleefully covered the Vatican's effort
to censor the book, reprinting some of the more colorful anecdotes,
from one about an unnamed priest who tried to smuggle a suitcase
full of cash into Switzerland, to one about a priest who had
engaged in homosexual acts and was reassigned and promoted to sweep
the scandal under the rug. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the more salacious or shocking anecdotes date back decades.
The most recent Vatican scandal, the murder last year of the
captain of the Swiss Guards by a disgruntled junior officer, is
fleetingly mentioned, without any suggestion of sinister subplots. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No dissolute priests or scheming cardinals are identified by
name. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The book does not use people's real names so it is difficult
to accuse the authors of defamation,'' Marinelli said. ``If some
figures want to recognize themselves, then I admire their
humility.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Vatican broke a long official silence by
issuing a statement laying out its position.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a penal law,'' the statement said, ``which, as in the
case of the civil code, foresees crimes against the community
itself as much as against individual persons, as in the case of
calumny, slander and serious offense against the dignity of the
person and his particular office.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement added, ``Thus, this is not a case of sanctions
against freedom of thought, but protection of the intangible rights
of all persons, as is true of civil codes in most states of the
world.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in his apartment, which overlooks the dome of
St. Peter's Basilica, Marinelli, 72, said he felt he was being
unfairly persecuted for telling the truth. He compared his
situation to that of Savanarola, the reformer who was burned at the
stake, and Padre Pio, the mystic friar who was investigated by the
church many times before he was beatified this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marinelli, who for years worked in the Congregation of Eastern
Churches, a department of the Vatican, said that while ``almost
everyone'' in the Vatican bureaucracy had read the book and many
had let him know they privately agreed with a large number of its
criticisms, none of his former colleagues were willing to defend
him publicly. He said friends were afraid to call him at home,
fearing his phone had been tapped. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The book does not question the sanctity of Jesus Christ, the
Eucharist or the Catholic Church,'' he said plaintively. ``It just
points out that the Vatican is made up of men who, like me, are
flawed.'' He said he and many others within the church were
disgusted by the rampant careerism and corruption of some
officials, and felt that a ``purification'' of the church was
needed as it entered the third millennium. ``The book was an act of
love for the church,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marinelli said he had been approached to collaborate on the book
by someone he declined to identify, who had heard him criticize the
inner workings of the Vatican and asked him to put his thoughts on
paper. He said he was interested in presenting his four main
grievances about Vatican operations _ careerism, the secretive
selection of bishops, Freemasons in the Vatican and the lack of a
union for Vatican employees (to encourage reform). The gossipy
details were included ``to illustrate the main principles of the
book.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the anecdotes were what persuaded Lorenzo Ruggiero, the
editor in chief of Kaos, a small publishing house in Milan, to
publish the book. Kaos specializes in anticlerical books and
Vatican exposes. Ruggiero explained he was at first resistant
``because the book was quite religious, too religious for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We changed our minds because we realized that if we didn't
publish it, nobody else would dare,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ruggiero said he had ordered a first printing of 7,000 books and
had expected modest sales. It has now sold out, and he said he has
requests from all over, including the United States, for 100,000
more copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vatican made a huge mistake,'' he said with obvious glee.
``Once they paid attention to the book, everybody paid attention.''

TENNIS' PROMOTIONAL EFFORTS PAYING OFF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Davis Cup matches at the Longwood Cricket Club,
just outside of Boston, this weekend sold out in 52 minutes. Not
bad, considering that for most of the 1990s fans, observers and
corporate sponsors have been searching for tennis's vital signs.
</P>
<P>
   A headline in Sports Illustrated a few years ago asked
plaintively, ``Is Tennis Dying?'' While it appears the patient has
survived, the prognosis is not yet for a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis organizations and promoters have been trying a variety of
marketing techniques _ including the old standby, sex appeal _ and
changes in the structure of the game to entice fans, young players
and the all-important corporate sponsors in an attempt to secure
the sport's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time tennis was really big, the driving sport in this
industry in the late 70s and perhaps early 80s,'' said Dave
Fogelson, the director for public relations at Reebok International
Ltd., in Stoughton, Mass. ``I'm not sure that will ever happen
again, but there are some encouraging signs, especially among the
women. We're certainly thrilled, for example, with our relationship
with Venus Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennis, as both sport and business, is a much limper image than
the vital enterprise that loomed on the sport scene 20 years ago.
Then, tennis rivaled golf as ``the fifth major sport,'' and much of
the country enjoyed watching players like Evert and Connors, while
even those who did not much care for the game wondered if Chrissy
and Jimmy were still in love.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a story line then that the game lacks today,'' said
Bob Williams, president of Burns Sports Celebrity Service, a
Chicago company that links advertisers with athletes for
endorsements. ``If you looked at golf in the late 70s and early 80s
it was struggling sponsor-wise, ratings-wise, just not pulling it
all together, and tennis had the marquee names of Connors and
(John) McEnroe and (Bjorn) Borg, and it was extremely popular. And
now, you look the 1990s have been a role reversal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of requests and contracts coming through this office,
Golf is way up and tennis is way down,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, participation levels have suffered. The Sporting
Goods Manufacturers' Assocation says US participation rates
declined by 17 percent for the 10 years beginning in 1987 _ and by
8 percent from 1996 to 1997 alone. Other analysts say the decline
has been much more precipitous, as much as 40 percent in the
current decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst part of all of this is we are all noticing lots of
empty tennis courts in the neighborhoods as we move around the
country,'' said an executive in one of the major sports marketing
firms. ``We can all remember a time in the early '80s when you just
couldn't reserve court time, and they could not build them fast
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials charged with organizing and promoting tennis have
launched a number of strategies recently, trying to bring the game
back. One initiative began at the grass-roots level, on the empty
courts.
</P>
<P>
   The US Tennis Association joined forces with a number of other
groups in September 1997 to launch USA Tennis Plan for Growth, a
five-year, $50 million, industry-wide initiative to get players _
especially young beginners _ back on the courts. This week in
Boston, marketing officials from the USTA, the ATP Tour for the men
and the WTA Tour for women pressed the results of their survey on
participation into the hands of reporters covering the Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
   According to their survey, the number of frequent tennis players
_ defined as playing more than 20 times a year _ increased by 10.2
percent to 5.4 million from 1996 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, according to the USTA, tennis ball sales were up 11
percent and racket sales up 8.5 percent in the first quarter of
1999, good news for the $1 billion international market in tennis
equipment, which had been in decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire US tennis industry has joined forces to make growth
in the sport possible,'' said USTA President Judy Levering.
</P>
<P>
   The women's tour also is trying to capitalize on it stable of
young, competitive stars _ Martina Hingis, Venus Williams, Serena
Williams, Lindsey Davenport and Anna Kournakova. The WTA Tour has
ginned up a marketing program unlike anything in the history of the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis has appeared on the cover of GQ in a tight, shoulderless
dress with the headline, ``The Champ is a Vamp.'' The Williams
sisters, enveloped in American flags, posed for Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Serena designs her outfits for Reebok that turn heads on the
circuit. And the appeal of Kournakova has assumed Hollywood-starlet
proportions. The young Russian may have difficulty cracking the
tour's top 10 ranking, but People magazine has named her one of the
50 most-beautiful people in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help it if I'm beautiful,'' the pouty Kournakova said,
disarming critics.
</P>
<P>
   The WTA Tour has hired a marketing director, Susan Marenoff, for
the first time, and its television rights were acquired last year
by Arnon Milchan's Regency Enterprises, the producer of the movie
L.A. Confidential. Milchan publicly touts a strategy of merging
sports and entertainment by arranging for screen tests for the
sisters Williams, and inviting some of the women players to the
Cannes Film Festival and Hollywood parties.
</P>
<P>
   Although it all has set off a debate, with some commentators and
former stars like Martina Navratilova urging a focus on skill, the
WTA Tour has turned the corner much faster than the men. An
attendance record of about 3.7 million was set in 1998, and WTA
officials say they are running ahead of that by about 8 percent
this year. Television numbers are up, too.
</P>
<P>
   But even with that success, corporate support remains a tough
pull. When tennis was strong, the name Virginia Slims was almost
more readily associated with tennis than tobacco. But since the
Canadian software manufacturer Corel Corp. dropped its sponsorship
of the tour in 1997, other companies have hesitated to take up the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate America is concerned about the staying power of the
young stars,'' said the marketing executive. ``The quick fades,
like Tracy Austin and Jennifer Capriati, are legendary and no one
wants to associate their brand with a huge, public failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the men's tournament seems to have trouble just
volleying.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi provided a glimmer of hope that an old rivalry
would be rekindled earlier this year, winning the French Open and
meeting Sampras in the Gentlemen's Final at Wimbledon. But
Sampras's destruction of Agassi at center court only reinforced the
fact that the men's tour has but one star _ and Sampras is famously
reticent, and incapable, of publicizing the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no knock on Pete Sampras, who may be the greatest of
all-time,'' Williams said, ``but he would not make anyone's list of
charismatic athletes, and he's said before that endorsements are
not important to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The ATP Tour has been forced to sign a costly marketing contract
and to restructure the competitive rules of the tour.
</P>
<P>
   ATP inked 10-year, $1.2 billion marketing agreement with ISL,
the Swiss-based marketing firm that is lauded for its work on the
Olympics and last year represented the Men's World Cup soccer
tournament. The contract is perceived as a frank admission that the
sport is malingering. After all, it's marketing strategy once
consisted of simply having Connors and Borg, or Borg and McEnroe on
the court.
</P>
<P>
   And in 2000, the men's tour will drastically alter the rules
that govern its rankings, dumping the current point system that
even some dedicated fans find imponderable. Instead, players will
compete in the four Grand Slam events, nine other tournaments _
designated as the Super 9 _ and five tournaments of their choice to
determine the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   The Super 9 events will be mandatory, helping the men's tour
overcome the problem of players choosing their own schedules, with
the frequent result that person best positioned to beat Sampras
opts out of some tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   While ATP officials tout the new competitive scheme and the
marketing initiative as sufficient to produce a renaissance, others
wonder to what extent the situation is salvaegable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The group of young women, including Venus, has been the
perfect antedote to some of the staleness in the industry,''
Reebok's Fogelson said. ``And it would certainly be nice to see
someone come along, in the mold of a McEnroe or maybe a Connors,
who would lend some passion to the men's side, again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, that said, I think that even if that did happen, you
probably would not see tennis return to the heights of the time
when it was a really driving business,'' he said. ``Most people do
not think that would happen.''

 &HT;    Huffy reports profits
 &HT;    By Lynn Hulsey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Huffy Corp. reversed losses from last year and
reported a profit for the quarter ended June 30, but still laid off
140 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Huffy said it earned nearly $5.3 million, or 50 cents a share,
compared with a loss of $26,000 during the second quarter of 1998.
Sales for the quarter dropped 5 percent to $172 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company fell short of analysts' expectations. Analysts
surveyed by First Call Corp. had a consensus estimate of 55 cents
per share.
</P>
<P>
   An increasingly competitive bicycle marketplace has Huffy
consolidating suppliers, streamlining manufacturing, reducing
administrative expenses and upgrading its distribution network to
cut costs and improve service.
</P>
<P>
   During the second quarter, 120 jobs were eliminated at the
Farmington, Mo., plant, and 20 salaried employees lost their job in
Miamisburg, Springboro, Farmington and South Haven, Miss., said
Thomas Frederick, vice president of finance and chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Huffy's service segment saw net sales grow to a record $67
million, a 19.4 percent increase over the same period a year ago.
The company's sporting goods segment, which includes bicycles and
basketball systems, reported a 16.5 percent decline in sales to
$105.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Don R. Graber, chairman, president and chief executive, said
that while the company service segment enjoyed strong sales and
earnings growth, the bicycle unit faced intense competition from
Asian imports.
</P>
<P>
   ``This combined with the overall softness of the sporting goods
market made for a challenging quarter in our Sporting Goods
segment,'' Graber said.

TENNIS' PROMOTIONAL EFFORTS PAYING OFF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Davis Cup matches at the Longwood Cricket Club,
just outside of Boston, this weekend sold out in 52 minutes. Not
bad, considering that for most of the 1990s fans, observers and
corporate sponsors have been searching for tennis's vital signs.
</P>
<P>
   A headline in Sports Illustrated a few years ago asked
plaintively, ``Is Tennis Dying?'' While it appears the patient has
survived, the prognosis is not yet for a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis organizations and promoters have been trying a variety of
marketing techniques _ including the old standby, sex appeal _ and
changes in the structure of the game to entice fans, young players
and the all-important corporate sponsors in an attempt to secure
the sport's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time tennis was really big, the driving sport in this
industry in the late 70s and perhaps early 80s,'' said Dave
Fogelson, the director for public relations at Reebok International
Ltd., in Stoughton, Mass. ``I'm not sure that will ever happen
again, but there are some encouraging signs, especially among the
women. We're certainly thrilled, for example, with our relationship
with Venus Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennis, as both sport and business, is a much limper image than
the vital enterprise that loomed on the sport scene 20 years ago.
Then, tennis rivaled golf as ``the fifth major sport,'' and much of
the country enjoyed watching players like Evert and Connors, while
even those who did not much care for the game wondered if Chrissy
and Jimmy were still in love.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a story line then that the game lacks today,'' said
Bob Williams, president of Burns Sports Celebrity Service, a
Chicago company that links advertisers with athletes for
endorsements. ``If you looked at golf in the late 70s and early 80s
it was struggling sponsor-wise, ratings-wise, just not pulling it
all together, and tennis had the marquee names of Connors and
(John) McEnroe and (Bjorn) Borg, and it was extremely popular. And
now, you look the 1990s have been a role reversal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of requests and contracts coming through this office,
Golf is way up and tennis is way down,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, participation levels have suffered. The Sporting
Goods Manufacturers' Assocation says US participation rates
declined by 17 percent for the 10 years beginning in 1987 _ and by
8 percent from 1996 to 1997 alone. Other analysts say the decline
has been much more precipitous, as much as 40 percent in the
current decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst part of all of this is we are all noticing lots of
empty tennis courts in the neighborhoods as we move around the
country,'' said an executive in one of the major sports marketing
firms. ``We can all remember a time in the early '80s when you just
couldn't reserve court time, and they could not build them fast
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials charged with organizing and promoting tennis have
launched a number of strategies recently, trying to bring the game
back. One initiative began at the grass-roots level, on the empty
courts.
</P>
<P>
   The US Tennis Association joined forces with a number of other
groups in September 1997 to launch USA Tennis Plan for Growth, a
five-year, $50 million, industry-wide initiative to get players _
especially young beginners _ back on the courts. This week in
Boston, marketing officials from the USTA, the ATP Tour for the men
and the WTA Tour for women pressed the results of their survey on
participation into the hands of reporters covering the Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
   According to their survey, the number of frequent tennis players
_ defined as playing more than 20 times a year _ increased by 10.2
percent to 5.4 million from 1996 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, according to the USTA, tennis ball sales were up 11
percent and racket sales up 8.5 percent in the first quarter of
1999, good news for the $1 billion international market in tennis
equipment, which had been in decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire US tennis industry has joined forces to make growth
in the sport possible,'' said USTA President Judy Levering.
</P>
<P>
   The women's tour also is trying to capitalize on it stable of
young, competitive stars _ Martina Hingis, Venus Williams, Serena
Williams, Lindsey Davenport and Anna Kournakova. The WTA Tour has
ginned up a marketing program unlike anything in the history of the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis has appeared on the cover of GQ in a tight, shoulderless
dress with the headline, ``The Champ is a Vamp.'' The Williams
sisters, enveloped in American flags, posed for Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Serena designs her outfits for Reebok that turn heads on the
circuit. And the appeal of Kournakova has assumed Hollywood-starlet
proportions. The young Russian may have difficulty cracking the
tour's top 10 ranking, but People magazine has named her one of the
50 most-beautiful people in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help it if I'm beautiful,'' the pouty Kournakova said,
disarming critics.
</P>
<P>
   The WTA Tour has hired a marketing director, Susan Marenoff, for
the first time, and its television rights were acquired last year
by Arnon Milchan's Regency Enterprises, the producer of the movie
L.A. Confidential. Milchan publicly touts a strategy of merging
sports and entertainment by arranging for screen tests for the
sisters Williams, and inviting some of the women players to the
Cannes Film Festival and Hollywood parties.
</P>
<P>
   Although it all has set off a debate, with some commentators and
former stars like Martina Navratilova urging a focus on skill, the
WTA Tour has turned the corner much faster than the men. An
attendance record of about 3.7 million was set in 1998, and WTA
officials say they are running ahead of that by about 8 percent
this year. Television numbers are up, too.
</P>

 &HT;    DEMOCRATS TO LAUNCH HIGH-TECH MESSAGE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As he stood in a Des Moines hotel parking lot last
month, Joe Andrew flipped open his sleek silver laptop, fired up a
cellular modem, and downloaded a video file from the Internet site
of George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the hotel, the Texas governor was telling supporters that
he favors federal subsidies for ethanol, a grain-based additive to
gasoline and a political priority for Iowa farmers.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers circulated among national reporters, seeking to
assure them that Bush's pro-ethanol stance could be safely ignored
as ``old news.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, insisted Andrew, chairman of the Democratic National
Committee. He showed the reporters the material from Bush's Web
site, evidence that the front-running Republican presidential
candidate had never before broached the ethanol issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly,'' Andrew said Friday, ``the reporters were more taken
with my ability to access all that stuff in a parking lot minutes
after he spoke than with the fact that the Bush people had just
tried to take them for a ride.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cherubic-faced Andrew, who took over the chairmanship
last March, has a wider agenda than being a one-man response team.
If Andrew has his way, the Democrats will enter the 2000 campaign
armed with political cybertools never employed on such a scale in a
national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As the youngest state party chair ever to serve in Indiana,
Andrew blended voter registration files with detailed data about
age, race, income, religion and the like to create a detailed
picture of the state's voting population.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 and again in 1998, he supplied the state's Democratic
county chairman with a steady stream of CD-ROM disks. The local
leaders used the disks to organize targeted mailings and
door-to-door canvassing, substantially increasing Democratic
turnout from prior years.
</P>
<P>
   That helped the party elect more new officeholders last year in
Indiana than in any year since Franklin Roosevelt's landslide
victory in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' Andrew said, striking a some keys on his
desktop computer to bring up a voter database that covers all 92
counties in his native state.
</P>
<P>
   Typing in the name ``John Smith'' as a handy example, Andrew
soon determined that this particular Smith and his wife are both
swing voters who have moved between the Republican and Democratic
camps in successive primaries. Although that makes them unlikely
party volunteers, they are good prospects to receive a series of
highly customized political messages.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Andrew intends to employ the same blend of technology and
targeting on a national scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology really needs no translation from what we have
done in Indiana,'' Andrew said. ``As you know, the presidential
race is not a national race. It is 50 state races. So we'll try to
use that type of technology across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice, a few dozen counties will get most of the attention
from what the Democrats have dubbed the ``Internet Center
Project.'' That name translates into a targeted blizzard of
personalized letters, e-mail, telephone calls, and visits from
like-minded neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's what you're doing,'' Andrew explained in his modest
office, which overlooks the main Amtrak rail line between
Washington and points south. ``You're simply using the Internet to
rebuild a commonality of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew holds that with the breakdown of urban neighborhoods,
civil society, and the ethnic-based ward system, the old politics
of geography has been supplemented by a new politics of shared
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``All politics is local, but local has been redefined,'' Andrew
recently told The New Republic magazine. ``Now people will
associate with fellow gardeners or car enthusiasts wherever they
are, often through the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And while the use of the Internet tends to skew toward white,
high-income persons,'' he adds, ``that's rapidly changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew did not disclose how much the Democrats plan to spend on
the their project. But it's clear that Andrew has already reached
out to untapped pool of contributors to help fund the high-tech
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole new community of people that are willing to
invest in technology because they have made their money in
technology,'' Andrew said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've created something like between 200,000 to 300,000 new
millionaires in the technology community in the last six and a half
years. When you go to people who have made money in this area and
you ask them to make a contribution to the Democratic National
Committee, what they like to see and hear is that their dollars are
going to these kind of projects,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew took over a party organization with financial troubles,
and ``the DNC far exceeded everybody expectations of what we'd be
able to do here,'' he said. ``You have a rookie from the minor
leagues like me coming up _ how the heck, people asked, can he
possibly get the debt paid off?

 &HT;    DEMOCRATS TO LAUNCH HIGH-TECH MESSAGE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As he stood in a Des Moines hotel parking lot last
month, Joe Andrew flipped open his sleek silver laptop, fired up a
cellular modem, and downloaded a video file from the Internet site
of George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the hotel, the Texas governor was telling supporters that
he favors federal subsidies for ethanol, a grain-based additive to
gasoline and a political priority for Iowa farmers.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers circulated among national reporters, seeking to
assure them that Bush's pro-ethanol stance could be safely ignored
as ``old news.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, insisted Andrew, chairman of the Democratic National
Committee. He showed the reporters the material from Bush's Web
site, evidence that the front-running Republican presidential
candidate had never before broached the ethanol issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly,'' Andrew said Friday, ``the reporters were more taken
with my ability to access all that stuff in a parking lot minutes
after he spoke than with the fact that the Bush people had just
tried to take them for a ride.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cherubic-faced Andrew, who took over the chairmanship
last March, has a wider agenda than being a one-man response team.
If Andrew has his way, the Democrats will enter the 2000 campaign
armed with political cybertools never employed on such a scale in a
national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As the youngest state party chair ever to serve in Indiana,
Andrew blended voter registration files with detailed data about
age, race, income, religion and the like to create a detailed
picture of the state's voting population.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 and again in 1998, he supplied the state's Democratic
county chairman with a steady stream of CD-ROM disks. The local
leaders used the disks to organize targeted mailings and
door-to-door canvassing, substantially increasing Democratic
turnout from prior years.
</P>
<P>
   That helped the party elect more new officeholders last year in
Indiana than in any year since Franklin Roosevelt's landslide
victory in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' Andrew said, striking a some keys on his
desktop computer to bring up a voter database that covers all 92
counties in his native state.
</P>
<P>
   Typing in the name ``John Smith'' as a handy example, Andrew
soon determined that this particular Smith and his wife are both
swing voters who have moved between the Republican and Democratic
camps in successive primaries. Although that makes them unlikely
party volunteers, they are good prospects to receive a series of
highly customized political messages.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Andrew intends to employ the same blend of technology and
targeting on a national scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology really needs no translation from what we have
done in Indiana,'' Andrew said. ``As you know, the presidential
race is not a national race. It is 50 state races. So we'll try to
use that type of technology across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice, a few dozen counties will get most of the attention
from what the Democrats have dubbed the ``Internet Center
Project.'' That name translates into a targeted blizzard of
personalized letters, e-mail, telephone calls, and visits from
like-minded neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's what you're doing,'' Andrew explained in his modest
office, which overlooks the main Amtrak rail line between
Washington and points south. ``You're simply using the Internet to
rebuild a commonality of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew holds that with the breakdown of urban neighborhoods,
civil society, and the ethnic-based ward system, the old politics
of geography has been supplemented by a new politics of shared
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``All politics is local, but local has been redefined,'' Andrew
recently told The New Republic magazine. ``Now people will
associate with fellow gardeners or car enthusiasts wherever they
are, often through the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And while the use of the Internet tends to skew toward white,
high-income persons,'' he adds, ``that's rapidly changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew did not disclose how much the Democrats plan to spend on
the their project. But it's clear that Andrew has already reached
out to untapped pool of contributors to help fund the high-tech
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole new community of people that are willing to
invest in technology because they have made their money in
technology,'' Andrew said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've created something like between 200,000 to 300,000 new
millionaires in the technology community in the last six and a half
years. When you go to people who have made money in this area and
you ask them to make a contribution to the Democratic National
Committee, what they like to see and hear is that their dollars are
going to these kind of projects,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew took over a party organization with financial troubles,
and ``the DNC far exceeded everybody expectations of what we'd be
able to do here,'' he said. ``You have a rookie from the minor
leagues like me coming up _ how the heck, people asked, can he
possibly get the debt paid off?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we've clearly exceeded those expectations. One of the
reasons for that is that we have a significantly higher number of
contributors from the technology area. And at least in part that's
because that's my base. I am technology person. I speak the
language that resonates in that community.''
</P>
<P>
   At 39, Andrew remains a practicing intellectual property lawyer
as well as a favorably reviewed author of a post-Cold War thriller
novel. He is a partner in the Anson Group, an Indianapolis-based
biotechnology firm that in turn owns several Internet companies.

 &HT;    MindSpring shares rise again on Dell rumor
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shares of MindSpring Enterprises were up slightly
Friday, again fueled by rumors of a possible deal with Dell
Computer.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring closed at $48.75, up $1.75. The stock went as high as
$49.18 3/4 earlier in the day, fueled by a comment by Dell Computer
Chief Executive Michael Dell at the computer maker's annual
shareholders meeting in Austin, Texas, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Answering a question about a potential linkage with MindSpring,
Dell said the companywill ``aggressively enter the market for
Internet access'' in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   However, he did not say he was in the market to acquire an
Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure buying is the way to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell already offers its own branded Internet service in Europe.
Dell pays a wholesale price for access through a deal with
Excite.com.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Chairman Kevin Rollins said Dell.net in the United States
would ``follow the European model.''
</P>
<P>
   The company says it will roll out Internet access whether or not
it acquires a U.S. service provider. An announcement on Dell's
plans could come as soon as next week.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring refused to comment on any speculation regarding any
possible ``business combinations'' with Dell or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring has been fending off rumors about possible mergers,
acquisitions and other ``business combinations'' since it released
a cryptic announcement June 24 saying it was talking with
unspecified companies about unspecified business deals.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of merger deals are fueled by the fact that both computer
makers and Internet service providers such as MindSpring are facing
stiff competition within their respective industries.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as Free-PC.com, Micron Electronics, IBM and
others are offerering free or deeply discounted PCs to users who
sign up for Internet services such as CompuServe or Prodigy
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile several new start-up companies such as 1stUp.com,
NetGenie and NetZero are offering free Internet access to customers
who agree to view advertisements while they're online.

UNEMPLOYMENT IN BAY STATE AT 3 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HEATHER KAMINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The unemployment rates in Massachusetts dropped to 3.0
percent in June and the number of residents working hit another
high as the state's economy continued its steady expansion..
</P>
<P>
   The national unemployment rate edged up to 4.8 during the same
period, marking 52 consecutive months that the Massachusetts
unemployment rate has fallen below the national average.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate has hovered around 3 percent for the last
six months, reaching a low of 2.8 percent in March and a peak at
3.2 in May.
</P>
<P>
   If current trends hold for the second half of the year, the
annual unemployment figures would be the lowest recorded since the
state began keeping figures in 1970. In 1987, the annual average
unemployment rate came in at 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between booms and bust and a real steady
prosperity,'' said Andre Mayer, senior vice president for
Associated Industries of Massachusetts. ``Having a good labor
market for a long time makes a real difference in bringing people
into (the state), getting the youth unemployment rate down, and
pushing the economic benefits in the core area of Boston out to the
greater metropolitan area.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayer said the last time Massachusetts had a year as good as
this was in early 1988, until the recession hit.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, things look much more stable, said Fred Breimyer,
chief economist for the State Street Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no immediate clouds on the horizon,'' Breimyer said.
``In fact, some of the news has improved as the effects of the
Asian crisis have diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   Job levels in Massachusetts hit an all-time high last month at
3,221,000, as 3,300 new jobs were created. The state has posted
record high employment levels in each of the last five months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth has been very strong in all sectors except in
manufacturing,'' said Elliot Winer, an economic analyst with the
state Division of Employment and Training.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing jobs fell by 700 in June, and are off 3.4 percent
since June 1998. The manufacturing sector, which deals mostly with
exports, was badly hurt by problems in the Asian economy.
</P>
<P>
   The retail sector posted the largest gain in June, adding 1,700
jobs, with a huge gain in specialty retail stores. In the past
year, retail has added 14,500 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Job growth in the service sector slowed a bit, but the number of
jobs increased by 2.4 percent in the past year. Winer said these
numbers have remained strong, though, because these jobs are
usually higher paying.
</P>
<P>
   Construction jobs rebounded a bit in June, adding 700 new
positions, but Mayer said this number is much lower than it was 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that we are seeing an evolution into a
more service-oriented economy,'' Mayer said. ``You see fewer good
jobs for non-college-educated people. This economy does place a
premium on a certain level of education.''
</P>
<P>
   The only negative in the Massachusetts economy, analysts said,
is the shortage of labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were more people to work, there would be more jobs,''
Mayer said. ``Three percent (unemployment) for Massachusetts is
like a full-employment economy.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ ``It is good for everyone to know how to forget,'' the
French historian Ernest Renan observed in 1882, and to preserve
national unity France has often chosen to overlook the most
uncomfortable moments of its past.
</P>
<P>
   But not President Jacques Chirac, who four years ago boldly
acknowledged French complicity in the Nazi-ordered roundup of
thousands of French Jews on July 16, 1942, in the Velodrome d'Hiver
stadium in Paris. And on Friday he went to a village that the
Germans wiped out in 1944 to say that barbarity was possible ``in
all countries and in all times.''
</P>
<P>
   Chirac inaugurated a visitor center in Oradour-sur-Glane, a
village whose ruins are preserved as the SS ``Das Reich'' Division
left them after killing 642 men, women and children on June 10,
1944. In his remarks, he put Oradour in a long list of other
brutalities beginning with the massacres of Protestants in Catholic
France in 1572 and continuing through the killings of Kosovo
Albanian civilians by Serbian forces in Kosovo this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Despite revulsion over the Holocaust, genocide had been
attempted again in Rwanda, he reminded his country. And like
Oradour in France and Lidice in Czechoslovakia, other places like
Srebrenica in Bosnia and the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee
camps in Lebanon have become symbols of human brutality, he said,
alluding to the failure of European peacekeeping forces to stop
Bosnian Serbs from killing Muslims in 1995 and the failure of
Israeli forces occupying Beirut to prevent killings in the
Palestinian camps in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oradour and all the martyrs remind us that barbarity is
possible in all countries and in all times,'' Chirac said. ``Europe
has no higher meaning than to be the contrary of what happened in
Oradour by incarnating a dream of peace and a humanist ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   The SS division that laid waste to Oradour included volunteers
and conscripts from Alsace, a French territory annexed by the
Germans when they invaded. Nine years later, the citizens of
Oradour returned the decorations that had been awarded to the
village by the postwar French government after 14 Alsatians were
first tried and then, after mass protests in Alsace, the Parliament
in Paris voted to give 13 of them amnesty. An Alsatian volunteer
who was sentenced to death was later pardoned.
</P>
<P>
   As an American author, Sarah Farmer, pointed out in her book on
Oradour, ``Martyred Village,'' published by the University of
California Press this year, even Gen. Charles de Gaulle, the
Resistance leader and Chirac's political mentor, had pleaded for
understanding of Alsatian sensitivities in the interests of
preserving national unity.
</P>
<P>
   That concern remained paramount in France as long as Francois
Mitterrand, Chirac's predecessor, was in office; Mitterrand himself
had served in the French collaborationist government in Vichy
during part of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But Chirac's speech in 1995 acknowledging French guilt, and the
trial and conviction of a prominent postwar official, Maurice
Papon, in 1997 and 1998 for crimes against humanity as a Vichy
functionary in Bordeaux, changed the climate.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was the first time elected officials in Oradour, where
2,000 people now live in a new village that was built beside the
ruins of the old one after the war, agreed to let the mayor of
Strasbourg, the Alsatian capital, come and make a gesture of
reconciliation. The French state provided $2 million of the nearly
$10 million it cost to build the visitor center, and gave more than
$200,000 last year to help keep the ruins from crumbling into
oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Lamaud, a guide in the village whose sister, who was 4 at
the time of the massacre, was among the people killed by the Nazis,
tells visitors the lesson of Oradour is the evil of fanaticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the young people among you will learn the lesson and
not let yourselves be indoctrinated,'' he told one group recently.
``What happened here can happen anywhere, and indeed it continues
in other places even today.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamaud, born a year after the massacre, said his parents were at
a wedding in a nearby village on the day of the massacre.
``Otherwise, I wouldn't be here,'' he explained.

RICHARD BORDEN, 89; WILDLIFE PHOTOGRAPHER, WAS AFFILIATED WITH
DISNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Borden, a wildlife photographer who contributed footage
to many motion pictures and TV shows, died Monday at his home in
Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Borden had a long affiliation with the Disney Studios. He
contributed segments to many of the studio's films including ``The
Vanishing Prairie'' and ``The Living Desert.'' He also contributed
to the studio's TV shows and, in 1964, was featured in a segment of
``The Wonderful World of Disney'' in which he was referred to as
``probably the world's foremost bird photographer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Borden's nature work led to commissions to produce films for
several baseball teams. As he explained in 1958, ``In 1951, I was
invited to Fenway Park to appear on television between the halves
of a Red Sox doubleheader. I showed some duck film taken with the
camera gun, which I invented. With the tool of my trade in hand, I
photographed some of the ensuing game with quite exciting results.
After following birds in flight, following a baseball was much more
predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   The appearance led to films on the Red Sox, the Kansas City
Athletics and the Detroit Tigers. He also shot several official
World Series films.
</P>
<P>
   He was the president of the Massachusetts Audubon Society during
the 1960s. For more than 40 years, he lived on an estate in
Concord, Mass. and maintained his 50 acres of ponds, rolling
meadows and woods as a wildlife preserve that is still open to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Borden was born in Fall River, Mass. He graduated from
Harvard College in 1933 and served in the Navy during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, instead of joining his family's textile business,
he joined the staff of the National Audubon Society in New York for
a year, before becoming executive director of the National Wildlife
Federation in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1949, I decided to expand my avocational motion picture
actvities into a full-time business,'' he wrote in the 25th
anniversary report of his class at Harvard. ``The advent of
television opened new areas for wildlife photography and with more
enthusiasm than technical knowledge, I embarked on the project of
producing 30 15-minute television shows under the series title
`Wonders of the Wild. '
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhat to my suprise,'' he wrote, ``the series sold well
enough to keep the infant company, Borden Productions, Inc., going
until I could expand to other fields.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a charming man, who ``always had a twinkle in his eye,''
his daughter, Beatrice Knox-Johnston, said Friday. His contribution
to his Harvard anniversary report may explain why. ``I am working
at the thing I have always wanted to,'' he wrote, ``and my business
allows me to travel to Europe, both for work and pleasure, to shoot
grouse in Scotland, ducks in Manitoba and our grouse and woodcock
in Vermont in the fall. ''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his daughter Beatrice of Nantucket, Mass., he leaves his
wife, Beatrice (Brown); three other daughters, Jane Chermayeff of
Santa Fe, Betsy Carlson of Santa Barbara, and Patricia DuPont of
Rowayton, Conn; four sons, Spencer of Concord, William Sweney of
Santa Barbara, Michael Sweney of Los Angeles, and John Sweney of
Houston; 15 grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.

 &HT;    Recreational lake linked to deaths closes indefinitely
 &HT;    By Jenna Hunt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ An area recreational facility closed its lake
Thursday because of a microscopic organism linked to the deaths of
two swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of Twin Lakes in Beaufort County shut down the swimming
lake Thursday to research the presence of naegleria fowleri, an
amoeba that causes a rare but deadly form of meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   A Pitt County teen became infected with the disease and died
after swimming there last July, health officials said. A 3-year-old
girl from Pitt County contracted the disease and later died after a
swim at the lake in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to do the responsible thing,'' said Twin Lakes
spokesman Herman Gaskins. ``It's closed indefinitely. The owners
made the decision _ they said they were not going to take a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The disease, called primary amebic meningoencephalitis, killed
five people in the United States in 1998: two cases in Texas, one
in Oklahoma, one in Florida and one here on July 24.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 100 cases have been reported in the United States
since the disease was discovered 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meningitis is a potentially fatal inflammation of the membranes
covering the brain and spinal cord. Several types exist, some of
which are extremely contagious and deadly.
</P>
<P>
   The amoebic form of the disease is not contagious, but it is
almost always fatal, said Dr. John Morrow, Pitt County health
director.
</P>
<P>
   The waterborne amoeba forms in any body of freshwater where the
temperatures climb higher than 80 degrees _ especially in still or
slow-moving lakes, ponds and streams.
</P>
<P>
   The amoeba infects people when water is forced deep into the
nasal cavity, usually through diving, jumping or falling into
freshwater. It enters the brain through the nasal tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Beaufort and Pitt county health departments are conducting
public awareness campaigns to inform residents of the risks of
infection from the rare disease. But neither county currently
monitors the quality of water in lakes and ponds, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Regional Division of Water Quality in Washington, N.C.,
monitors river basins in 20 counties in eastern North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do the river basins and it doesn't include smaller lakes or
ponds,'' said Kim Cole, a division environmental technician. ``I
don't know how we determine which waters are monitored.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Recreational lake linked to deaths closes indefinitely
 &HT;    By Jenna Hunt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ An area recreational facility closed its lake
Thursday because of a microscopic organism linked to the deaths of
two swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of Twin Lakes in Beaufort County shut down the swimming
lake Thursday to research the presence of naegleria fowleri, an
amoeba that causes a rare but deadly form of meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   A Pitt County teen became infected with the disease and died
after swimming there last July, health officials said. A 3-year-old
girl from Pitt County contracted the disease and later died after a
swim at the lake in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to do the responsible thing,'' said Twin Lakes
spokesman Herman Gaskins. ``It's closed indefinitely. The owners
made the decision _ they said they were not going to take a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The disease, called primary amebic meningoencephalitis, killed
five people in the United States in 1998: two cases in Texas, one
in Oklahoma, one in Florida and one here on July 24.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 100 cases have been reported in the United States
since the disease was discovered 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meningitis is a potentially fatal inflammation of the membranes
covering the brain and spinal cord. Several types exist, some of
which are extremely contagious and deadly.
</P>
<P>
   The amoebic form of the disease is not contagious, but it is
almost always fatal, said Dr. John Morrow, Pitt County health
director.
</P>
<P>
   The waterborne amoeba forms in any body of freshwater where the
temperatures climb higher than 80 degrees _ especially in still or
slow-moving lakes, ponds and streams.
</P>
<P>
   The amoeba infects people when water is forced deep into the
nasal cavity, usually through diving, jumping or falling into
freshwater. It enters the brain through the nasal tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Beaufort and Pitt county health departments are conducting
public awareness campaigns to inform residents of the risks of
infection from the rare disease. But neither county currently
monitors the quality of water in lakes and ponds, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Regional Division of Water Quality in Washington, N.C.,
monitors river basins in 20 counties in eastern North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do the river basins and it doesn't include smaller lakes or
ponds,'' said Kim Cole, a division environmental technician. ``I
don't know how we determine which waters are monitored.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole said the agency's current methods would not detect the
presence of the microscopic amoeba.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials warn residents to hold their noses while under
water or use nose clips while swimming in any freshwater swimming
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Twin Lakes owners, Jesse and Ottis Crisp, are going to study the
lake with county and state public health officials to decide which
actions to take to ensure the health and safety of swimmers,

CANADIAN DEALERS SUE FORD OVER OUTLET CONVERSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Canada's Ford dealers are suing Ford Motor Co. of
Canada for breach of contract over its plan to convert more than
100 Lincoln-Mercury outlets to the Ford name, creating 25 percent
more Ford dealers across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed Thursday in Ontario Superior Court by the
Canadian Ford Dealers Association on behalf of its members, does
not seek financial damages but demands that the company honor its
franchise agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Some dealers said this was only one reason they were unhappy
with Ford's Canadian subsidiary. They are angry about steps they
say Ford Canada has taken to gain more control over their
businesses, including taking minority equity stakes when
dealerships are sold.
</P>
<P>
   In their suit, the dealers contend that when Ford's blue oval
sign goes up over Canada's Lincoln-Mercury outlets in October,
dozens of existing dealers will have new competition within the
10-mile radius of exclusivity specified in their sales agreements.
</P>
<P>
   One plaintiff, Del Bedard, president of Thorncrest Sherway Ford
in Toronto, said he would have four new Ford dealers within his
franchise area, one about a mile away. ``The issue in Toronto is
that they are doubling the number of Ford dealers, to 32,'' Bedard
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Canada says the move is part of its effort to simplify the
dealer system and eliminate customer confusion over Ford products,
which include Lincolns and Mercurys. The company argues that what
the dealers are calling new competition has been in place for
years. Lincoln-Mercury dealers sell 86 percent of the Ford line,
said John Arnone, a spokesman for Ford Canada. To deal with
confusion among consumers, he said, ``we are just formalizing an
existing situation.''
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, Ford Canada established three types of
dealer chains, with some product overlap, to build market share.
Mercury dealers once sold a car called a Meteor, which was a Ford
with different chrome trim.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the company's dealers now operate under the Ford-Mercury
banner, but some are pure Ford and some are Lincoln-Mercury.
Lincoln-Mercury dealers, however, sell Ford minivans, sport utility
vehicles and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit came after Ford's decision to eliminate the Mercury
brand name as of Oct. 1, 1999, and to allow existing Mercury
dealers to sell all Ford products.
</P>
<P>
   While Ford dealers have taken the unusual step of filing a suit,
many Canadian dealers of other brands are just as unhappy with
their manufacturers. Canada has about 3,500 dealers, giving it
twice the dealer-to-sales ratio as in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sonja Falkenberg, director of the Ford dealers association, said
one result of putting all dealers under the Ford banner would be
that more would fail.
</P>
<P>
   A Ford of Canada spokesman, Joe Arnone, said the company was
merely responding to customer demands that Ford represent itself
under one banner in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers tell us today there is way too much confusion
about where to buy a Ford. This is a simple way to lift this veil
of confusion,'' he said.

TALKS ON CHINESE EMBASSY BOMBING REACH STALEMATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese and U.S. officials wound up two days of
negotiations on Friday, unable to agree on compensation for the
NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in May.
</P>
<P>
   Another round of talks was scheduled for later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate was a disappointment to officials who had hoped an
agreement would clear a persistent stumbling block in relations
between the two as a potential military conflict brews over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents Clinton and Jiang Zemin have each expressed a desire
to recover some of the good will that was lost over sharply
diverging views of the NATO air campaign in Kosovo, and was further
eroded by the embassy bombing. Yet the deadlock, after inconclusive
bickering about money, appeared to represent a clash of midlevel
officials who represent the less forgiving sides of their
respective governments.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official familiar with the talks described the officials'
sharply different approaches as a ``complete disconnect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was lawyers' talking at lawyers,'' the official said.
``Entirely different mind-sets.''
</P>
<P>
   If money was the topic, the underlying issue for China seemed to
be an obsession with regaining national pride that it feels was
wounded in the bombing and harmed further by what it regards as an
utter lack of remorse by the Americans. Beijing has rejected U.S.
explanations that the bombing was an accident.
</P>
<P>
   On the U.S. side, lawyers in the delegation were most worried
about setting a precedent for future compensation cases, to the
extent that they even refused to use the term ``compensation'' in
the talks, saying ``humanitarian payments'' instead.
</P>
<P>
   A legal adviser to the State Department who headed the U.S.
team, David Andrews, issued a short statement that called the
substance of the talks sensitive and complex. Progress was made,
Andrews said, but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   What is so sensitive and complex appears to be the starting
point that Chinese officials still see the bombing as a deliberate
attack on the Chinese nation, making them unwilling to discuss
other bilateral issues until the bombing question has been
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Chinese official, Zhao Qiz-heng, elaborated on the
Chinese view on Thursday at a news conference. He ridiculed the
U.S. explanation that they had hit the wrong target because of
defective intelligence and outdated maps, comparing the odds that
three outdated maps were used simultaneously to rolling dice and
getting triple snake eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of throwing a one, that's 1 out of 6,'' said Zhao,
who heads the Information Office of the State Council, or China's
Cabinet. ``If you roll three dice, it is 1 out of 216. If you add
in other errors, that is like rolling 10 dice. The chances are
close to nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials have demanded compensation for the families of
three Chinese who died in the bombing and for 20 who were injured,
as well as for damage to the building. They have also asked that
those responsible for the bombing be identified and punished.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Americans have demanded reciprocal compensation
for damage to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, where rock-throwing
broke most windows. The U.S. consulate in another city, Chengdu,
was burned in a riot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States hopes to make these payments as soon as
possible,'' Andrews' statement said. ``Both sides also raised their
respective property claims.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy said that Andrews would leave
Beijing on Saturday and that he or someone else would resume talks
at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Without a resolution over the bombing, officials say, it may be
difficult for Washington and Beijing to regain footing on another,
arguably far more significant, issue, China's entry to the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   China's effort to join the organization, desired both by China's
leaders and by the Clinton administration, now looks increasingly
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   For a deal to go through this year, an agreement between the
United States and China would essentially have to be worked out
before Presidents Clinton and Jiang meet in September at the Asia
Pacific Economic Conference in New Zealand. If this year's deadline
is not met, China's entry may be delayed for several years, a
potentially serious setback to China's ability to effect
much-needed reforms in its state-owned industries.
</P>
<P>
   China's top trade negotiator, Long Yongtu, said again this week
that China would not resume trade talks until the bombing issue had
been resolved.

WHEN A ROSY PICTURE SHOULD RAISE A RED FLAG  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With stock prices near their highs and corporate earnings
looking great, investors might think they can take a vacation from
the grunt work of analyzing company financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   Big mistake, says Robert A. Olstein, a 30-year veteran of
financial analysis and the manager of the Olstein Financial Alert
mutual fund. Olstein thinks that investors must be especially
vigilant now against accounting tricks that, while legal, mask a
company's real financial performance.
</P>
<P>
   One reason to be watchful, he said, is that companies may be
reaching to meet analysts' expectations. ``A lot of companies are
using accounting shenanigans to project smooth earnings paths that
rarely exist,'' he said. ``Investors need to look behind the
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission agrees. One commissioner,
Norman S. Johnson, said in a speech earlier this year that
``managed earnings'' are a top enforcement priority. ``Barely a
week goes by without an announcement that another large company is
restating its past results,'' Johnson said. (Last week it was
McKesson HBOC's turn, for the second time this year.)
</P>
<P>
   Olstein's fund aims to buy companies with solid earnings and
bets against those whose financial performance looks more mythical
than real. The fund is up 30.9 percent this year and an average of
28.324 percent a year since it opened in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   During three decades on Wall Street, Olstein has identified a
number of red flags in financial statements. ``What these alerts
help to show is if there are deviations between the statements as
portrayed by the company and economic reality,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EARNINGS VS. CASH FLOW Olstein first examines what a company
generates in cash flow from its operations. A company with excess
cash flow can raise dividends and survive tough times without being
forced to borrow or sell assets.
</P>
<P>
   To calculate a company's cash flow, start with net income. Add
back what it has taken in depreciation expenses and accounts
payable. Then subtract capital expenditures, inventories and
accounts receivable.
</P>
<P>
   Watch out, Olstein said, if net income is much higher than cash
flow. The company may be speeding or slowing its booking of income
or costs, perhaps to meet analysts' earnings forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies Olstein is concerned about is Shared Medical
Systems, which supplies information management systems to the
health care industry. In the first quarter of 1999, the company
reported net income of $18 million and cash flow of $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Why the disparity? Among other things, Olstein found that
accounts receivable were rising almost 50 percent faster than
revenues, while accrued expenses, a reserve set up by the company
for future payments, fell 30 percent in the quarter. The company's
chief financial officer was unavailable for comment last week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BALANCE-SHEET DISPARITIES Sometimes there is a difference
between earnings reported to shareholders and those reported to the
Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   Companies carry two sets of books, one for shareholders and one
for the IRS. Footnotes to financial statements reconcile them by
comparing income taxes currently payable _ the IRS version _ with
the taxes a company has deferred, the results of which shareholders
see.
</P>
<P>
   A company reporting higher earnings to shareholders through the
use of deferred taxes should be scrutinized, Olstein says. He
estimates that about one in six companies fall into this category.
A notable example was in 1997, when the Sunbeam Corp. reported
earnings of $189 million. Current taxes on the income were $8.4
million but deferred income taxes were $66 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an alert that the company was reporting materially
higher earnings to shareholders than to the IRS,'' Olstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam later said it had overstated earnings by wide margins,
and its stock plunged. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNSUSTAINABLE SALES The best revenues are those that continue
year in and year out. Temporary increases are less valuable and
should garner a lower price-to-earnings multiple for a company.
</P>
<P>
   Olstein sees Tricon Global Restaurants, owner of KFC, Taco Bell
and Pizza Hut, as an example of a company booking temporary income.
Last year, it sold restaurant franchises worth $248 million, or 3
percent of sales. ``There's nothing wrong with it,'' Olstein said.
But ``it's not ongoing, so it should carry a lower P/E.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RESERVES TO THE RESCUE? If a company puts aside too much into
reserves that it uses later, that could mask a slowdown in its
business, Olstein said. An example of a company that may use
reserves to smooth out its earnings is Microsoft, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently said that the SEC was investigating the way
it accounts for reserves; industry experts think the commission may
be looking for evidence of so-called cookie-jar accounting, in
which reserves are set aside in case they are needed later to
bolster flagging earnings.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After the announcement, Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial
officer, said, ``We are obviously a company that is known for
conservatism, and I would be surprised if someone was to examine
our books and suggest otherwise.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEFERRED EXPENSES A company's costs should be matched against
the revenues they produce. Companies that defer large amounts of
current expenses to later periods ought to be monitored, Olstein
says.
</P>
<P>
   Deferred expenses show up as an asset on the balance sheet and
are amortized over time. The footnote in which management details
its assumptions on how long these assets will have value is an
important piece of the puzzle and should be checked for economic
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Olstein pointed to America Online as a company that in its early
stages used accounting methods that proved too optimistic. Its
deferred marketing costs in the mid-1990s were greater than its
earnings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers, meanwhile, canceled their accounts more quickly
than America Online wrote them off. The company changed its policy
in October 1996 to recognize marketing expenses as they are
incurred; Olstein said he thought the accounting shift contributed
to the sharp rise in its stock. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ACQUIRED PROFITS Under purchase accounting, an acquisition is
included in the buyer's financial statements from the date of the
purchase. To make sure that a company's earnings gains are not
solely a result of acquisitions, investors can examine pro forma
earnings _ the net income of the combined companies if the
acquisition had been made at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   For example, starting in 1993, HFS, now part of the Cendant
Corp., reported earnings growth rates of more than 30 percent,
owing largely to acquisitions. The rate at which the company's
earnings grew, not including acquisitions, was an estimated 11
percent, Olstein noted, according to figures found in the footnotes
to the financial statements. Reality caught up to the perception of
Cendant's growth rate in April 1997, and its stock fell by half. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INVENTORY AND RECEIVABLES Slower inventory turnover or rising
accounts receivable can signal a sales slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   To calculate inventory turnover, add together a company's
inventory position at the start and end of a period and divide it
in half. Then divide the company's revenues by the result.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts measure receivables by assessing how many days of sales
are held in the receivables category. First, they figure a
company's daily sales, taking the year's revenue and dividing it by
365. Then they take the accounts receivable and divide it by the
daily sales number.
</P>
<P>
   A company recently experiencing both slower inventory turnover
and rising receivables, Olstein said, is Xerox. He had owned the
stock but became concerned at the end of 1998, when ratios in both
inventories and receivables weakened. Jeffrey J. Simek, a Xerox
spokesman, said those were ``just two factors, both inward
looking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a host of other factors we would consider
particularly important,'' Simek continued. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WATCHING WRITE-OFFS Comparing the reported earnings of a company
with its retained earnings _ what it actually nets each year _ is a
revealing exercise for shareholders in companies that take
reorganization or other charges regularly. Such charges, Olstein
said, can distort earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a company's retained earnings before paying dividends are
not growing as much as its reported earnings before write-offs,''
he said, the charges may be masking underperformance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CORE CUTBACKS Some corporate expenses, like those for research
and development at a technology company, are crucial to future
growth and should not be cut, though doing so may make for a
better-looking earnings report.
</P>
<P>
   Olstein cited Eastman Kodak as one such company that has
recently cut important research costs. In the fourth quarter of
1998, it announced a reduction in R&AMP;D costs that contributed 31
percent of its earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Allen, a Kodak spokesman, said the decline was part of the
company's broad effort to cut costs. ``We still spend $1 billion on
R&AMP;D,'' Allen said. ``We have determined that combined R&AMP;D and
sales, general and administrative costs in the neighborhood of 26
percent of revenues is a good financially prudent position for us
to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Olstein is not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology companies,'' he said, ``should not derive their
growth rate from cuts in research.''

THE FOURTH BEST NEWSPAPER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 18, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I agreed last spring to talk to a group of bankers. But as I
drove past Fenway Park on my way to the newspaper, it struck me
that droning on about developments in economics was unlikely to
deeply engage the audience after dinner. On the other hand, a
newspaper is at least as interesting as a baseball club. So I
talked about the future of newspapers in the Internet age instead,
and only one fellow fell asleep.
</P>
<P>
   That meant talking about The Boston Globe. It is the fourth best
newspaper in the United States, I said, and the only one of those
published in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   I quickly explained there are two or three other papers that can
easily lay the ``fourth best'' claim in any given year. There is a
fairly stable hierarchial structure in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the top tier are the two fully national papers, the New York
Times and the Wall Street Journal, so well differentiated that they
compete for the same audience only at the very top of their
enormous markets. Most readers choose one or the other. That means
these papers are highly stable; there is no great liklihood of
readership ``tipping'' from one standard to the other as with, say,
computer software.
</P>
<P>
   There is a hybrid, too: the Washington Post, a highly
profitable, well-run regional paper that happens to be published in
the nation's capital, and therefore has a national audience. It is
no accident that all three papers are family-owned.
</P>
<P>
   The next tier consists of very successful regional papers which,
for reasons of geography and destiny, possess a national voice.
They are the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Globe and
the Philadelphia Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   For many years these papers too were family enterprises. Each is
somewhat less personally chartered now, the creatures respectively
of a family feud, a foundation, and a pair of newspaper chains.
There is always a horse race among them: Who's getting better?
Who's getting worse? What paper in the next lower tier is bidding
to join the club?
</P>
<P>
   The metric here is size and complexity. (That's why I'm omitting
the Christian Science Monitor, an otherwise excellent paper.) To
play in this league, you have to formulate a sufficiently large and
attractive paying audience of readers, plus advertisers who want to
reach them, to field a team of 400 or more reporters and editors.
They must interact daily with readers, each other and the
competition, in order to deliver a distinctive version of ``all the
news.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no narrative engines of comparable power anywhere in
radio, television, the ``info-tainment'' industry or the Internet.
Nor, it seems to me, are there likely to be any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   How did the Globe become one of a handful of brand names in
American journalism? My favorite stop on a tour here used to be the
third floor corner of the building where a series of commemorative
pages from around the turn of the last century were displayed. The
Globe's publishers routinely grouped themselves among the other
``quality'' papers of the day: Greeley's Tribune, Bennett's Herald,
Sulzberger's Times, Pulitzer's World, Medill's Tribune. Even when
they were just starting out, the ambition to be among the best was
always present.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, General Charles H. Taylor, the builder of The Boston
Globe, the man who edited it for 50 years, early on made common
cause with the wave of immigrants. Indeed, for many years during
Boston's Gilded Age, the Globe was know as ``the maid's paper,'' in
contrast to the Yankee Transcript and the commercial Herald. Taylor
had been midwest as a private soldier during the Civil War. He had
some sense of how the opening of the West would shrink New
England's importance in the nation's scheme of things; he
understood how cohesion among its classes could restore some
measure of it.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the 20th century was not a good time for
Boston. In the 1940s and 1950s, the city's papers reaped much
scorn. Boston was ``the poor farm of American journalism,'' gibed
one critic, at a time when New York was downtown and Chicago its
gaudy shopping district. The Globe for many years, preserved some
of the old British ways, with ads on page 1 and editorials signed
``Uncle Dudley.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Davis Taylor and John I. Taylor, two cousins who
shared an office for 30 years, ``took the lid off'' in the 1950s
that the strategy really began to pay off, as the maids'
grandchildren moved to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe moved its operations to the edge of town and became
the low-cost producer, then acquired talent as the Post and
Traveler failed. The paper broke the Herald's cross-ownership of a
lucrative television station, and appointed a new editor, Thomas
Winship. It reinvested profits in the business. That meant
investing in people.
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper is rather like a large symphony orchestra. Its basic
elements are the same from place to place. The editor is like a
conductor, except that he or she requires a raft of deputies,
subeditors, and telephone operators to help cater to the tastes of
the town. Each big paper is distinctive in its own way. Let me
briefly mention a few elements unique to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Alone among the states, Massachusetts' capital was never moved
to a central place from its commercial hub. As a result, politics
may be more intertwined with daily life in Boston than almost any
other place. A cadre of more than thirty editors, reporters and
columnists cover it with zest, campaign to campaign, from the White
House to the State House to City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Sports is the other half of the franchise. Aficionados know that
the Globe's experts _ often three or four deep _ rank at the top
nationally in football, baseball, basketball, hockey, tennis, golf,
soccer, boxing, rowing, skiiing, yachting, high school and Olympic
sports.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe covers culture, high and low. An unusally large number
of staff and part-time critics (twenty five) follow art,
architecture, drama, books, dance, music (classical, jazz and
rock), movies, television, magazines and restaurants. Even more
reporters keep tabs on developments in modern living.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is unusual profusion of Globe columns. Ellen Goodman
is the one everyone knows. (She is carried in more than 300
newspapers.) The late lamented Mike Barnicle and Patricia Smith
were the next best known, before they came to grief. But a strong
new crop has taken root, including Alex Beam, Eileen McNamara,
Michael Holley and Hiawatha Bray.
</P>
<P>
   There is a large and versatile metro staff. A half-dozen
suburban zones. A talented business department. A platoon of
science writers. A corp of investigative reporters big enough to
staff an FBI field office. A small, blue-chip group of foreign
correspondents, many of whom move up to the national papers. A
distinguished editorial page to cogitate and make endorsements. A
lively op-ed page. Photographers and designers galore. And now the
Web heads.
</P>
<P>
   Because it evolved out of an interest in periodical magazines,
the Globe still maintains a separate Sunday department. Besides the
usual magazine, television guide and funnies, there is a seperate
book review, a travel section, a handyman columnist, a food writer,
an automobile writer, a personal finance specialist, and someday, I
hope, a computer writer. These specialists are at the top of their
trades. Add to these news sections containing the cream of the
week's efforts of the rest of the staff and the enormous cornucopia
of advertising. When these three pounds thump on the porch in the
morning, it can seem almost too much to bear.
</P>
<P>
   All four of these fourth-best dailys are losing circulation. So
is the Washington Post. Nobody really knows why. Nor is it clear
when it will stop. The Internet is part of it, so is the rest of
the variety of modern life. The Wall Street Journal, the New York
Times and the Post (with its weekly national edition) are all
expanding in the weekend market against them. Technology is making
it easier to slice away classified and help-wanted advertising to
cheaper more targeted forums. So in all liklihood the cost
structures of these big newspapers will have to change. Nobody
knows how much.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years from now, these regional papers may resemble local
versions of today's Financial Times of London, which circulates
around the world: sleek, slim, packed with high-quality information
and _ this is the key point _ great or even greater in the variety
of coverage.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, the fourth-best papers will saturate their local
markets. They will serve as complements to the national papers for
some readers, substitutes for most. They will trade their memories
of huge mass markets for a proportionately smaller, richer, more
enthusiastic audiences _ just as professional baseball has done so
successfully amid the sports explosion of these last 30 years.

SHARES THAT TRACK ASSETS ADD VALUE AT A COST  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most companies are not shy about doing most anything they can to
increase their stock prices. A growing number have concluded that
the best way to accomplish that goal is to create an entirely new
piece of paper.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking stocks, which first appeared in the early 1980s, have
become hot. Last week, the Walt Disney Co. said it would combine
its own Internet holdings with the Infoseek Corp. and create a new
company that it will control, Go.com. Later this year, the DuPont
Corp. will create a tracking stock for its life sciences business.
</P>
<P>
   And shares of the Microsoft Corp. jumped 5 percent on Friday
after reports that it has been considering a tracking stock for its
Internet businesses. All told, there are dozens of tracking stocks
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Robert Willens, a managing director and analyst at
Lehman Brothers who has served as an adviser to companies with
tracking stocks, discussed the pros, cons and potential pitfalls
for investors in tracking stocks. Here are excerpts: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Tracking stocks have been in the news a lot
recently, but they have been around for some time. Could you give
us a history?(end italics)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Technically, tracking stocks have been around for about 15
years. They were first used with General Motors' acquisition of
EDS, and then again when they bought Hughes Aircraft. Both those
were pretty much the only times they were used in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   What I call the modern era began with USX, when they issued a
stock to track the performance of their oil business, Marathon Oil.
</P>
<P>
   In that instance, the tracking stock was a compromise. Carl
Icahn, who at the time was a big USX shareholder, was exerting a
lot of pressure to separate Marathon from the parent. In order to
protect its debt rating, among other things, USX wanted to keep the
two companies together. So we came up with the tracking stock. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)How do you explain the surge in interest in tracking
stocks? It looks like a number of companies, including Disney, are
merely trying to highlight their Internet holdings.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The Internet probably has a lot to do with it. But a lot of
attention was focused on tracking stocks last February, when the
Clinton administration proposed in its version of the federal
budget to end the use of tracking stocks, and said any company
issuing a tracking stock would be treated as if it had sold the
tracked assets. That would subject the company to capital gains
taxes. Faced with such an onerous tax, it is unlikely anyone would
issue tracking stock should that proposal become law.
</P>
<P>
   But the negative proposal had the odd effect of getting people's
attention. All of a sudden, tracking stock became one of the tools
that corporations focused on. And when they did look at it, they
found it was such a powerful tool that it made sense for almost any
big company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Was this year's sudden rush of tracking stocks an
effort to beat the legislation and get grandfather status?(end
italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The way the administration's proposal was written, a company
would have been grandfathered for the first issuance of tracking
stock, but not for subsequent uses. That would have defeated the
purpose, because companies will want to use the tracking stock to
make acquisitions, to pay dividends and the like. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Is the impetus to issue a tracking stock decreased
if the stock of the parent company is doing well?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, it is. Unlocking value is the impetus here, by forcing
the market to pay attention to a business within a much larger
enterprise. By separating the business and giving it a separate
currency, or stock, you allow them the opportunity to make
acquisitions in that area and to compensate management.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Based on experience, does the issuance of a tracking
stock help to increase the stock price of the parent company?(end
italics)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Usually there is very little effect on the parent company
stock after the tracking stock is created. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What are some potential pitfalls and common
misperceptions about tracking stocks that investors should bear in
mind?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. One theoretical risk is that since these businesses are not
separated in any legal sense, creditors would have claim on those
assets if the parent ever got in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   And that leads to a common misperception. In some quarters,
there is still some confusion about who owns the company. A
tracking stock is not a company that has been spun off. A
shareholder has no direct claim on the tracked assets. And you have
no voting rights, except at the parent company level.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Have tracking stocks performed well?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. For the most part, they have been good investments. In
general, they tend to trade pretty much in line with their
independent peers, which is exactly what people hope will happen.

COMPETITORS CAN TEACH YOU A LOT, BUT THE LESSONS CAN HURT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 18)

<P>
   A few years back, a big pharmaceuticals company _ name withheld
to protect the embarrassed _ benchmarked its delivery methods
against a competitor's. The rival was combining product shipments
from different divisions, enabling it to negotiate bigger, and thus
lower-priced, shipping contracts. The pharmaceuticals company
figured it would do the same.
</P>
<P>
   It never happened. First, its logistics staff insisted that it
already got the lowest prices. Then, its data processing people
insisted that they were too busy to run the historical
transportation cost figures that could have proved otherwise. And
its salesmen insisted that only carriers dedicated to their
products could guarantee timely deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's three years later and the company still hasn't changed,''
said Thomas H. Slaight, a vice president of A.T. Kearney, the
consulting firm, which helped with the initial benchmarking
project.
</P>
<P>
   Ever wonder why companies are so amenable to letting others
study and emulate _ or, in corporate parlance, to benchmark _ those
things they do best? Why give away the family jewels?
</P>
<P>
   Probably because benchmarking, even with competitors, is a lot
less risky than it sounds. ``Chains like Wal-Mart and Target don't
make any secrets about what they do to succeed, because they know
most companies just aren't capable of adopting their approach,''
said Darrell Rigby, a director at Bain &AMP; Co., the consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Rigby should know: He recently helped a floundering discount
store chain benchmark its marketing and customer service procedures
against industry leaders, only to see his client's employees botch
any attempts to implement what they learned.
</P>
<P>
   Time was, just ferreting out who had the best practices, and
setting up teams to study them, was a big deal in itself. But
nowadays, that problem can be solved through trade association
records, Internet and intranet data bases, consultants _ and,
increasingly, managers whose full-time job is coordinating
benchmarking efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing the benchmarking attacks only 10 percent of the
problem,'' said Kevin S. Dehoff, a vice president at Booz Allen &AMP;
Hamilton, the New York consulting firm. ``The other 90 percent
involves changing your culture, your processes, your whole
philosophy so that you encourage your employees to learn and share
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the best-designed benchmark program can founder on many
shoals: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ (italics)Old habits die hard, even ones that employees rail
against.(end italics) When employees complained a few years ago of
slow expense reimbursements, the Xerox Corp. studied 26 companies
to find a way to speed up the payments. Problem was, the new system
entailed new forms, did away with cash advances and required people
to carry more than one corporate credit card.
</P>
<P>
   It took months longer than management expected for employees to
embrace the new system. ``Everyone resisted the changes, even those
that were unhappy with the old way,'' recalled Warren D. Jeffries,
manager of customer services benchmarking for Xerox.
</P>
<P>
   _ (italics)Corporate egos have a dark side.(end italics) It is
never easy to persuade employees that a competitor does something
better, particularly when that rival otherwise has a reputation as
a mediocre company. ``People don't realize that there can be a
pearl in the garbage,'' said Slaight of Kearney.
</P>
<P>
   _ (italics)Compensation systems may be out of sync.(end italics)
The Ford Motor Co. recently benchmarked General Electric's success
in getting managers to share ideas. But there was a hurdle: Sharing
ideas is a basis for bonuses at GE, but not at Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ford emphasized the benefits to the corporation as a
whole, and used its intranet to guide people in implementing an
idea-sharing process, said Mark K. Slagle, Ford's process
benchmarking champion.
</P>
<P>
   _ (italics)Higher-ups may be left out of the loop.(end italics)
``The people who implement the changes have to be the ones visiting
other companies and getting a first-hand look at what can or cannot
be applied to our environment,'' said Kathleen K. Mallette,
benchmarking manager at AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   They must also be charged with prodding the implementation
along, added Jack W. Hugus, vice president for best practices at
Lockheed Martin. ``Maybe they didn't budget for training, or maybe
it just wasn't high priority, but too often the divisional chiefs
let the process of implementing get stuck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is always the problem, too, that corporate
cultures differ. How do you get employees to make quicker decisions
if they have always been rewarded for following orders, or to take
risks when they have seen colleagues fired for failing?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the companies that can best navigate these obstacles are
those in trouble so deep that employees know their jobs depend on
turning things upside down.
</P>
<P>
   When Continental Airlines was swimming in red ink in the
mid-90s, it went to the healthy Southwest Airlines to see if it
could adopt Southwest's practice of ``cross utilizing'' personnel _
for example, using the same people who load baggage to process
customers at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Continental employees grumbled about doing more work for the
same pay. But they did not rebel. ``It's a lot easier to get a
buy-in when people know that, without more efficiencies, you may
have to lay them off,'' said Mark A. Erwin, Continental's senior
vice president of airport services.
</P>
<P>
   But Continental threw in a sweetener. It asked employees to list
all the ``dumb, non-value-added things,'' as Erwin put it, that
they did each day. Continental then dispensed with many useless
chores _ say, filing a daily report of how many tickets they
collected at the gate, when all tickets were sent to accounting for
tallying anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave them extra time to handle the extra duties, so they
didn't feel they had to work harder than before,'' he said.

   Shaping a Spinoff &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that Kansas City Southern Industries' most
valuable asset is the Janus Capital Corp. The question is, what
will the company do with it?
</P>
<P>
   The railroad operator wants to spin off Janus as a publicly
traded company, combining it later this year with the Kansas City
Southern subsidiaries Berger Associates and Nelson Money Managers,
as well as a 32 percent stake in DST Systems, to form Stilwell
Financial.
</P>
<P>
   But Janus officials prefer for Janus to be spun off by itself,
arguing that the market would place a higher valuation on the
stand-alone company's shares. An independent Janus, they add, would
also let them offer stock options as incentives to fund managers
and analysts _ helping it hire and retain talented people _ and
would insure that its huge cash flow goes toward its expansion.
</P>
<P>
   If Janus isn't spun off by itself, will any fund managers bolt?
No, said Thomas Bailey, the chairman of Janus.
</P>
<P>
   The situation should be of interest to Janus fund shareholders,
who have been among the lucky few to beat the broad market indexes
in recent years. According to Kanon Bloch Carre, the mutual fund
consulting firm in Boston, Janus' diversified stock funds have
scored the highest asset-weighted returns of the 10 largest fund
companies for two years running.
</P>
<P>
   Though the managers strongly prefer their plan to the company's,
no one has raised the possibility of leaving if they do not win,
Bailey said. ``We can make either structure work, but to us
unquestionably the best structure is to have Janus as a stand-alone
operating company,'' he said, adding that Janus officials presented
their plan to the Kansas City Southern board last month and were
told that it would be taken under advisement.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Kansas City Southern, Bill Galligan, said the
full Stilwell Financial spinoff was on track. It received approval
this month from the Internal Revenue Service to be tax-free to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proceeding with the plan as is,'' he said, adding that
``if something comes up better or even as good, I think our board
of directors would have to look at it.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Rating Fidelity Managers &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Think Fidelity and you may think Peter Lynch. Or Bob Stansky.
</P>
<P>
   You probably don't think Kenichi Mizushita. But maybe you
should.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lowell, the longtime watcher of Fidelity Investments, rates
Mizushita, manager of Fidelity's Japan Small Companies fund, the
top Fidelity manager in his latest report on the company. Sure,
Mizushita's great recent returns have been driven by a turnaround
in Japanese stocks. But when the Japanese market was down, his fund
didn't fall as far, Lowell noted. And this year, Mizushita was up
114.9 percent though Thursday, compared with 35.5 percent for the
MSCI Japan Small Cap index.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell, editor of the Fidelity Investor newsletter, which is not
affiliated with the fund company, considers the risk-adjusted
returns of each manager compared with those of what he considers
their appropriate benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Among managers of diversified Fidelity funds, Lowell ranks Neal
Miller of New Millennium No. 1, followed by Erin Sullivan of
Aggressive Growth, Charles Mangum of Dividend Growth, Harry Lange
of Capital Appreciation, and Stansky, of the $100 billion Magellan
fund.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the rankings, which are `front weighted'' and thus
give an edge to recent performance, Lowell considers Mangum the
best diversified manager at Fidelity. While some other top Fidelity
managers are ``very aggressive, with concentrated portfolios,'' he
said, Mangum is ``much more diversified and risk-conscious.''

<P>
   Dot-Com Products at Instinet &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Instinet Corp., the Reuters Group unit that operates the
world's biggest private electronic trading network for
institutional investors, plans to offer stock trading, mutual funds
and retirement accounts through a new brokerage firm called the
Instinet.com Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The moves are among several planned by Instinet to offer new
financial products and services including credit cards, mortgages
and company-specific research, according to company filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Instinet's primary business has been its trading system, which
lets brokerage firms and big institutions buy and sell stocks
anonymously. Although it now handles about 20 percent of trading in
NASDAQ stocks, competition from rivals like Archipelago and Island
ECN appears to be pushing Instinet to look for new business
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Instinet officials declined to elaborate on their plans.
Instinet.com's name suggests, though, that the company plans to
provide brokerage and financial services over the Internet.

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It would have been very difficult to
leave the Continental Airlines Arena disappointed on Thursday
night, when Bruce Springsteen began his first American tour with
the E Street Band in 10 years. If Springsteen's work is a journey _
and it is, not just in his close relationship with his fans but
also for the characters whose development he follows from album to
album _ then the three-hour, 26-song show stopped at nearly all
points on the map.
</P>
<P>
   The show was in many ways a return for Springsteen. It was a
return to his home state, New Jersey, and in dedication he
performed a rarely heard song, ``Freehold,'' a funny yet pointed
confessional folk song in which the Boss returns to the town that
still remembers him as a baby.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a return to the Continental Airlines Arena, where he
performed the inaugural concert when the arena opened in 1981 under
its precorporate sponsorship name, the Brendan Byrne Arena.
Thursday's show was the first of 15 sold-out concerts _ the most a
single act has performed at the arena _ in a tour that wraps up on
Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   It was a return to the E Street Band, most of whose members
Springsteen has been playing with since he was a teen-ager in
Asbury Park, N.J. Though he laid off the band in 1989, he keeps
returning to it, as if it were the only way to provide a
counterbalance to his more introspective, psychological solo work.
When the group tried to tackle one of those ballads, ``The Ghost of
Tom Joad,'' it had difficulty. The E Street Band isn't an outfit
that is very good at not rocking. The band, as Springsteen has
said, is a symbolic bridge between him and his audience.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was a return to Springsteen's fans. His career has
tended to cycle between those introspective albums that document
his internal battles with cynicism and despair and the full-band
rock ones that his audience craves. So after he released an
audience-pleaser with new E Street Band songs, ``Greatest Hits,''
in 1995, he turned inward with ``The Ghost of Tom Joad.'' Turning
right back around, during the last year he has given his fans two
things they've been asking for most: ``Tracks,'' a four-CD set full
of the songs he hadn't released over the years, and this tour.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed all in black (even his shoes, belt and wristbands _
everything except his gray hair), Springsteen, 49, didn't just lead
his band, he led people in the crowd, making them believe in the
great illusion of live rock-and-roll: that their participation _
their yelling, clapping, singing along _ is necessary to complete
the music. In ``Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out'' he egged on the crowd
with several minutes of James Brown-like soul-preacher testimony.
``Look out Ricky Martin,'' he joked as he shook his hips. ``I'm
filled with the spirit of the ghost of Tom Jones.'' In ``Murder
Inc.'' he took time for Nils Lofgren, Steve Van Zandt and himself
to solo on guitar after standing aside momentarily for Clarence
Clemons, the master of the rock saxophone solo.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen returns when rock 'n' roll needs him most, when
arenas are filled with manufactured teeny-bopper bands or music for
older teen-agers, white rock bands whose idea of classic pop is
gangsta rap. But what most of these bands, from 'N Sync to today's
Rolling Stones, lack is depth, the quality that keeps three hours
with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band from being nostalgia.
As a man who has always sung of borders psychological and physical,
Springsteen is aware that he stands on this border, and to stay on
the right side he waited until he was 10 songs into the set before
playing an actual hit, ``Badlands.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the show leaned heavily on the 1978 album that
contains ``Badlands,'' ``Darkness on the Edge of Town.'' It was the
perfect way to avoid being a nostalgia act: by sidestepping
nostalgia, going back to the album overshadowed by his surrounding
breakthroughs. It was those songs that contained the keys that
unlocked the themes he has wrestled with throughout his career:
characters balanced on the brink of a decision, staring at the
abyss, ready to jump in with the slim hope that just maybe their
dreams might await them at the bottom. ``I believe in the faith,''
he sang in ``Badlands.'' ``And I pray, that someday it may raise
me/Above these badlands.''
</P>
<P>
   The two recent unreleased songs that he performed Thursday
night, ``Land of Hope and Dreams'' (the show's gospel-derived
closer) and ``Freehold,'' bore out his belief that, yes, he could
rise above it. Springsteen's gift has always been that no matter
how far he has risen, he has never left the ground he is rooted in.

MAKE EVALUATIONS LESS OF A STRUGGLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the most part, performance evaluations are pretty painful.
Most managers hate talking about a subordinate's shortcomings and
no employee likes to get the word that he's anything short of
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   But there are ways to turn evaluations into useful tools to
improve employee performance.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with setting goals and then measuring the results,
said Dick Grote, author of ``Discipline without Punishment: The
Proven Strategy that Turns Problem Employees into Superior
Performers.'' Grote is a human resource consultant who lives in
Dallas and recently spoke to a group of managers at a seminar
sponsored by the outplacement firm Drake Beam Morin.
</P>
<P>
   Once goals are set, the talking part _ which everyone thinks is
the hardest part _ actually is easier.
</P>
<P>
   Before doing the evaluation, ask each employee to jot down his
accomplishments for the year, Grote suggested. That way, key
details won't be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many things more embarrassing than when a boss
forgets a major effort and is reminded during an evaluation when
the employee says, ``What about that Tompkins contract I did?''
</P>
<P>
   It's also really important to explain what it takes to get a
``distinguished'' rating, Grote said. Too often, companies explain
what it takes to get a middling rating but not a top one.
</P>
<P>
   And all that talk about performance evaluations being bogus
because they're subjective? Don't worry, advised Grote.
</P>
<P>
   When it's time for your appraisal, you don't want data, he said.
You want the answer to the question: How am I doing? And that takes
description, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After all, we don't use data when we choose a mate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Focus on one or two main messages you want the employee to hear,
Grote suggested. No one can remember 15 different subjects next
month.
</P>
<P>
   And eliminate some of the pre-evaluation anxieties by giving an
employee a copy an hour before the meeting so he can digest it, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BASE EVALUATIONS ON GOALS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Evaluations should be based on goals set with input from
individual employees. That's especially important in managing
younger employees because empowerment is so important to them, said
Melanie R. Webb, personnel officer with the Harris County Appraisal
District in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   And it's important to have a midterm review to check an
employee's progress toward meeting goals, Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   That way, any shortcomings can be addressed, she said. If a
manager waits until the end of the year, it's not proactive.
</P>
<P>
   The more specific a manager is, the more helpful the information
is to employees. To make it easier for managers to provide details,
Enron, for example, has coaching sessions for its managers.
</P>
<P>
   Managers are given scenarios and asked to write evaluations that
include a lot of concrete examples, said Kathleen Fenninger, senior
director of staffing for Enron Corp. Then they practice explaining
the evaluation to an ``employee.''
</P>
<P>
   During the training sessions, several of the managers discover
exactly what is meant by detail, said Fenninger. Doing an employee
evaluation isn't something that's intuitive, she said. It has to be
learned.
</P>
<P>
   It's also important to talk about career goals at the annual
evaluation, said Len George, executive vice president of NCI
Building Systems, a manufacturer of metal buildings and components.
</P>
<P>
   That way, a production line employee who wants to go into sales
can talk about making a switch, he said. And if the company has its
eye on moving an employee into plant management, the manager can
suggest some skills or courses the employee might need to make the
move.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good motivator, George said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A DIFFERENT APPROACH &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PolySpec Corp., a Houston maker of floor coatings and sealants,
does the traditional evaluations each year but recently added a
quickie quarterly evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Every three months, employees are asked to appear before a
three-member management panel to explain what they've done to
contribute to the success of the company, said company President
M.W. ``Buddy'' Ellisor Jr. The meetings, which last only about five
minutes, were designed to divvy up the quarterly profit-sharing
funds that PolySpec sets aside.
</P>
<P>
   Ellisor said the panel also asks each employee who, with the
exception of himself, contributes to the success of the company.
The answers have been real surprises, said Ellisor, who said five
production employees all identified the same colleague and raved
how great he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't aware of it,'' said Ellisor, who said the employee
got a big bonus and raise as a result. And you can bet that Ellisor
is keeping a close eye on his star performer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all look at him differently,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leaders of both parties said Friday that the House
is prepared to cut off money to finance the Air Force's $70-billion
F-22 fighter program, a highly unusual decision that has stunned
the Pentagon and military contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The stage for a full House vote next week was set Friday when
the House Appropriations Committee unanimously approved a
$268-billion Pentagon spending bill denying the Air Force the $1.8
billion it sought to build the first six F-22s. The cutoff is
supported by Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and key Republican leaders who say the
untested fighter, at $200 million a plane, is simply too expensive
to build.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to concentrate on those things that work,'' Hastert
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon reacted fiercely. ``This decision, if enacted,
would for all practical purposes kill the F-22 program, the
cornerstone of our nation's global air power in the 21st century,''
Defense Secretary William Cohen said Friday in a letter to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing quite like this has happened in decades, according to
senior members of Congress and veterans of Pentagon spending wars.
Congress almost never kills major weapons systems that are about to
reach the assembly line. And the F-22 is the biggest Air Force
weapons program of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a remarkable occurrence, one of the rarest
imaginable,'' said Dale Bumpers, who retired from the Senate in
1998 after 24 years, and now heads the Center for Defense
Information in Washington. ``I'm absolutely amazed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force wanted to buy the first F-22 fighter jets this
year, even though its flight tests have barely begun, its on-board
computers are not ready and its cost has grown to $200 million
apiece, roughly four times the cost of the F-15, the plane it was
intended to replace.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee tried to cut off funds for
the F-22 10 years ago, calling it a financial disaster waiting to
happen. But that was when the plane was in the early stages of
research and development, not on the verge of full production.
About $20 billion has been spent on research and development since
the plane was first proposed in 1981, and two test models have been
built.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon and Congress occasionally scuttle planes, bombs and
missiles on the drawing board, or choose to build fewer weapons
than originally planned once production has started. But very
rarely, if ever, do they block the initial production of a major
weapons system deemed ready to build.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the House tried to kill funds for the B-2 bomber, but
the bill was defeated on the floor. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
killed another Air Force program, the A-12, in the research and
development phase in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The move to kill the F-22 has flabbergasted the Air Force, the
Pentagon and military contractors, who were expecting widespread
congressional support for significant military spending increases
after the war in Yugoslavia. They are already heavily lobbying
senators to countermand the House's move when the military spending
bill comes to a House-Senate conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how they arrived at this specific
decision,'' said Bob Rearden, program manager for the F-22 at
Lockheed Martin, the military contracting giant that is to build
the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this happening? Money, senior House members said.
</P>
<P>
   The recently retired chairman of Lockheed Martin, Norman
Augustine, once predicted: ``In the year 2054, the entire defense
budget will purchase just one tactical aircraft.'' Maybe he wasn't
joking, Congress is now realizing.
</P>
<P>
   The $70-billion price tag on the F-22 program far exceeds this
year's entire budget for buying weapons and represents roughly 25
percent of the annual cost of every government agency outside the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   And the F-22 is only one of three different fighters the
Pentagon wants to buy for the four armed services. They would cost,
all told, $350 billion _ far more than the entire annual defense
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Air Force's money and everything in the Air Force's mind
is focused on the F-22,'' said Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., the
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and a long-time
champion of the F-22.
</P>
<P>
   But Young, who in 29 years in Congress has been a stalwart
advocate of defense spending, said the Air Force needs well-paid
pilots, spare parts and refurbished jets more than it needs the
F-22.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to fix it,'' he said of the Air Force. ``Now, can we
fix it if we put all our money into one basket? No, we can't. It
would be far better to stop, take a look at where we are, and to
make a decision that will last into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be more to the decision than money alone. It might
never have happened if Newt Gingrich were still the speaker,
members said. The plane is to be built in Marietta, Ga., in
Gingrich's old district.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And there are deeper issues involved, some of which may be
personal and political.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee's report on the proposed
Pentagon budget, released Friday, suggests that the Air Force may
have been less than forthcoming with Congress about the F-22's
costs and capabilities, and the urgency to build it.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force told Congress 10 years ago that it could build 750
F-22s for $67.5 billion. It now appears that a similar sum would
buy no more than 339 planes. The cost per plane has gone from $90
million to roughly $200 million, auditors say, and the Air Force
has understated the F-22's true cost by $9 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   The House report said there have been problems with the plane's
wings, brakes, fuselage, fuel lines and engines, and that its
on-board computer systems remain untested. Senior Air Force
officials acknowledged no technical problems with the F-22.
Rearden, of Lockheed Martin, said they have been fixed. ``There are
no show-stopping technical issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials said they face a threat from foreign
aircraft like the Russian MiG-29 that they cannot overcome without
the F-22. ``We can no longer guarantee that we'll be able to
dominate the sky,'' said Maj. Gen. Bruce Carlson, director of Air
Force operational requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee report said that, 10 years from now, ``the
United States will have a 5-to-1 numerical advantage of advanced
fighters against our most challenging adversaries without the
F-22.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee said the F-15, which the F-22 was supposed to
replace, has at least 15 or 20 years of life left in it, and that
the Joint Strike Fighter, which is being developed for the Air
Force, Navy and Marines, will be in service by then.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money's not there,'' said Rep. John Murtha of
Pennsylvania, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee.
``There's no threat like the Soviet threat hanging over us. The
time is right to stop this thing.''

THE BOUNCE FROM STOCK BUYBACKS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 18) 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Please note that the word AT in parentheses has been used in

<P>
   Burned once, shame on you; burned twice, shame on me. That
variation on an old saying explains much investor behavior. It
takes a lot to persuade investors who have already lost money in a
given stock to keep believing in it if it keeps falling, no matter
what its fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the market's typically tepid reaction when a company
says it will be repurchasing its stock on the open market; many
such stocks have taken multiple hits, and are at depressed levels
as the announcements are made.
</P>
<P>
   Officemax, which traded early last year near $20 a share, took
two blows last fall: The overall market had a sharp correction, and
the company missed Wall Street's third-quarter earnings estimates
by a 4 cents a share. The stock fell to below $7.
</P>
<P>
   Though the shares jumped a little after the company announced
two repurchase programs, one late last year and another earlier
this year, the stock is still trading at not much more than half
its 1998 high.
</P>
<P>
   Such a lukewarm reaction notwithstanding, it is difficult to
imagine a more unambiguously bullish sign than a company's decision
to use its spare cash to buy back its shares. After all, when a
company puts its own cash on the line, it must be confident that
the stock will climb. And it often does, beating the market in a
pattern known as the repurchase effect.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have demonstrated the effect. One, covering all U.S.
stocks from 1980 to 1990, found that the average company announcing
a repurchase plan will beat the market by a cumulative 12.6
percentage points for the four years after the announcement. The
average value stock with such a plan does even better,
outperforming the market by 45.3 points, on average, over the next
four years.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, the repurchase effect has another advantage: You
don't have to be a day trader to exploit it. Many other strategies,
by contrast, require almost immediate action. To capitalize on a
surprise announcement in a company's earnings, for example, you
often have to trade within hours of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with stock repurchase plans. Because the market's initial
reaction is so muted, there is generally plenty of potential
remaining for investors who act several weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   It seems too good to be true. So, naturally, a number of
skeptical professors have speculated in recent years that the
repurchase effect is nothing more than a statistical fluke, and
have predicted that it will disappear when studied in other places
and times.
</P>
<P>
   That is why another recent study is good news. Three professors
_ David Ikenberry of the Jones Graduate School of Management at
Rice University, Josef Lakonishok of the University of Illinois and
Theo Vermaelen of Maastricht University in the Netherlands _
focused on another place and time, Canadian stocks in the 1990s,
and found the repurchase effect alive and well.
</P>
<P>
   Another confirmation of sorts is seen in the reverse image of a
repurchase: a corporate decision to issue shares, either through
initial public offerings or secondary offerings. Study after study
has shown that companies issuing shares lag behind the market for
several years thereafter. Moreover, the pattern holds not only in
the United States, but also in several other countries.
</P>
<P>
   An investment newsletter, too, shows the positive results of the
repurchase effect. The Buyback Letter, edited by David Fried, is
the only one that I know to base its approach solely on the effect;
it has had a 32.2 percent return, annualized, from the beginning of
1997, soon after its birth, through May of this year, according to
The Hulbert Financial Digest.
</P>
<P>
   That compares with a 25.3 percent return for the Wilshire 5000,
a broad market index. In contrast, New Issues, published by the
Institute for Econometric Research and perhaps the best-known IPO
newsletter, produced a 19.9 percent annualized return over that
period. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sorry state of Wall Street research is the
subject of much buzz today among longtime investors. With more
analysts than ever following companies _ a 1999 study says there
are 2,427, up 32 percent from 1997 _ why are so many of their
reports unoriginal, unenlightening and unquestioning?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe these folks are too busy signing autographs from adoring
fans to bother with dull financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, analysts are the stars of the moment in the Wall
Street firmament. They are to the 1990s what investment bankers
were to the 80s. Gone are the days when analysts toiled in
obscurity, crunching financial figures onto eye-glazing
spreadsheets. Now they are front and center. And rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Top analysts are truly neck and neck with top investment
bankers, because the two now go hand in hand,'' said Joan
Zimmerman, principal of G.Z. Stephens, an executive search firm in
New York. ``The number of research analysts that had the capacity
to bring in significant numbers of deals was very limited in the
1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   A result, she said, is that compensation among top analysts has
hit $10 million a year, while junior analysts are receiving, on
average, $350,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Propelling many of these paychecks is a flood of stock issuance.
Analysts play an increasingly important role in creating demand for
a company's shares. Issuers ask potential underwriters not only how
their stock will be priced but also who will support it after the
deal is done.
</P>
<P>
   And so, Ms. Zimmerman said, the difference between a top analyst
and an also-ran has become the ability to bring the top 100
investors to the table for a corporation issuing stock.
</P>
<P>
   Selling has always been part of an analyst's job. Now it is a
major part. Consider the findings of a study of major investment
research firms conducted by Tempest Consultants for Reuters Group.
For the study, in its third year, analysts were asked how they
allocated their time.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, time spent on fundamental research has fallen from
47.58 percent to 39.89 percent. Next year, analysts expect to
devote less time yet _ 36.37 percent _ to research.
</P>
<P>
   Time spent on company visits and contact has also dropped, from
17.21 percent to 15.21 percent. But time spent selling to
institutional clients has risen to 23.22 percent from 22.11
percent.
</P>
<P>
   David Eidelman, a money manager at Eidelman, Finger &AMP; Harris in
St. Louis, was head of research for a regional brokerage firm from
1968 to 1975. He said he spent three-quarters of his time as an
analyst on fundamental research and company visits and 10 percent
with institutional clients. Now, when a salesman calls, Eidelman
said, ``He says, `Let me get the analyst on the phone with you.'''
</P>
<P>
   What analysts are selling increasingly today is not the ability
to plumb a company's business and uncover investment gems or scams
but rather the ability to make investors buy the stocks they
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Sure helps explain why so many analysts have been caught napping
recently when earnings shortfalls or accounting gaffes come to
light. It's another bull market phenomenon: Analysts are paid more
and more money to do research that is less and less substantive.
Maybe it should be called Research Lite: More spin, less filling. &QL;

JUDGE ALLOWS NAKED PHOTO SHOOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You can call it the Naked City once more.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ruled Friday, over the protests of City Hall,
that photographer Spencer Tunic can indeed snap pictures of 75
people lying naked on a street in downtown Manhattan Sunday at 5:30
in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the city had argued on Thursday that Tunic's act
might offend the people who live on the block where the shoot would
take place.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge, Harold Baer Jr., ruled: ``The privacy interests
of the residents of this neighborhood, who can avert their eyes,
cannot outweigh the rights of others to exercise their First
Amendment right to artistic expression.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's attorneys immediately went across the street to ask
the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals to stay Baer's ruling, but the
judges there saw no reason to reverse Baer's stand.
</P>
<P>
   Tunic, who is well-known and much-lauded in artistic circles for
his stark photos of naked bodies against empty urban backdrops, has
been arrested by the New York City police four times for his
efforts in recent years _ most famously on a Sunday dawn last
April, when he was handcuffed and dragged away after getting 175
people to lie down naked in the middle of Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   New York State has a law forbidding public nudity _ but
explicitly makes an exception for art and entertainment. Baer ruled
that Tunic's photography fits the exemption.
</P>
<P>
   The city had approved Tunic's application for a permit to
photograph 75 clothed people at 5:30 a.m. Sunday _ but then
rejected another request to take pictures of naked people in the
same place and the same time.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the city's lawyer, Sherrill Kurland, at first
argued that the case was about ``common sense.'' When Baer seemed
to be taking Tunic's side on the constitutional issue, Kurland
shifted tactics and said the real issue was that the proposed photo
site was a ``densely residential'' block. She further said the city
would consider negotiating for a different block.
</P>
<P>
   Tunic's lawyer, Ron Kuby, called Kurland's bluff and said Tunic
would be willing to move the site a few blocks over, to a much
emptier street.
</P>
<P>
   Baer asked Kurland if this was acceptable. She asked for more
time. By Friday morning, she had not come back with an answer, so
Baer ruled in Tunic's favor.

INVESTING WITH ERIN A. SULLIVAN: FIDELITY AGGRESSIVE GROWTH FUND

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 18)

 By WILLIAM R. LONG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Fidelity Investments, known for a willingness to let young
stock-pickers run big funds, and to invest the money aggressively,
Erin A. Sullivan may be the quintessential portfolio manager.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sullivan, 29, has been in charge of the $5.96 billion
Fidelity Aggressive Growth fund since April 1997. In that time, the
fund has posted total returns of 51.83 percent, annualized, versus
33.16 percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, according
to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   This year through July 15, the fund was up 44.34 percent, nearly
tripling the 15.4 percent gain of the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sullivan goes about her business with the self-assurance of
a Harvard graduate, the analytical rigor of a math theoretician and
the vigor of a marathon runner, all of which she is. But she has
not entered a marathon race roughly since she took the reins of
Aggressive Growth. ``It's hard to find time for anything else,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sullivan is kept busy picking new stocks and keeping track
of the 160 to 190 issues that are usually in the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   She joined Fidelity in 1991 as a research associate who followed
initial public stock offerings and medical-device and
hospital-supply companies. As an analyst, starting in 1993, she
covered the retail industry, and she became manager of the Fidelity
Select Retailing Portfolio in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   She managed the Select Software and Computer Services Portfolio
for about five months before taking over Aggressive Growth, which
was then named Emerging Growth. The name was changed last January.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sullivan said many investors had interpreted ``Emerging
Growth'' to mean that the fund held small-capitalization stocks,
though it actually owned many large-cap stocks. ``The fund's
investment style has always been aggressive,'' she said. ``The
style hasn't changed at all.''
</P>
<P>
   She uses computer programs to screen for companies with the
fastest earnings growth. She screens for revenue growth, too, she
said, ``to make sure that I'm not missing opportunities'' in young
companies that reinvest heavily instead of reaping profits.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sullivan also seeks earnings growth driven by gains in sales
volume rather than price increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that get me nervous about companies that are
growing their earnings solely through increasing prices is that
that price power might go away overnight, and then your earnings
stream is in jeopardy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sullivan might sell a stock, she said, if she detects hints
of a downturn in company fundamentals, like a buildup in inventory
or a loss in market share. And she is likely to sell if a company's
stock goes up too fast. ``If a company hits a price target earlier
than I expected, I think it's wise to take profits,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sullivan's focus on fast-growth companies and industries has
resulted in a concentrated fund. She said her top 10 stocks might
account for around 30 percent of total assets. A tally at the end
of June showed that 41.7 percent of the fund was invested in
technology companies, 15.7 percent in telecommunications and 13.9
percent in biopharmaceutical and medical device companies.
</P>
<P>
   Among her top 10 holdings is Exodus Communications, which
operates computer-network and Internet servers for other companies
on an outsource basis. The company is investing heavily in data
centers around the United States and abroad, so it is not yet
profitable, Ms. Sullivan said, ``but they're getting very close,
and the majority of their data centers are cash-flow positive.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that revenues of Exodus had more than quadrupled last
year, to $53 million, from $12 million in 1997, and that in the
first quarter of 1999, they were running at a $120 million annual
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Exodus, based in Santa Clara, Calif., had its initial public
offering last year. The stock has traded as low as $7.75 and as
high as $109; it closed last week at $138.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sullivan began buying Exodus stock in December, at a price
``in the low $30s,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another communications company in the fund's top 10 is MCI
Worldcom. Ms. Sullivan especially likes the company's fast
expansion in data transmission, Internet and international business
services. She said those segments have been growing at 60 percent a
year as the company concentrates on giving corporate customers a
wide range of ``end-to-end telecom services.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Sullivan took over the fund, it had a small holding of
Worldcom stock, then trading in the mid-$20s. She gradually built
up the position. With a big boost from the acquisition of MCI
Communications, MCI Worldcom revenues grew to $17.67 billion in
1998 from $7.35 billion in 1997. The stock is now at $90.125, more
than double its 52-week low of $39.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's top 10 also includes Biogen Inc., the
biopharmaceutical company. She said its healthy performance over
the past year came largely because of Avonex, a once-a-week
injectable treatment for multiple sclerosis. Strong sales of Avonex
contributed to a 38 percent increase in Biogen's second-quarter net
income, and operating earnings exceeded analysts' estimates by 2
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, which split 2-for-1 late last month, closed on Friday
at $71.625, up from a 52-week low of $20.875. Ms. Sullivan first
bought Biogen in September at a split-adjusted price in the high
$30s.

CLINTON NAMES ELAM AMBASSADOR TO SENEGAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Harriet L. Elam arrived in the nation's capital 36
years ago, a Simmons College graduate, and she took a job as a
secretary in the Army. She wanted to leave her native Boston, she
said, ``because I was tired of being the little Elam girl, Harry,
Clarence and Charles' little sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Kid sister Harriet, now 57, has just been nominated by President
Clinton as the next US ambassador to the Republic of Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador-designate must go before Senate confirmation
hearings in the next month.
</P>
<P>
   From a Roxbury family with many stars, including brother Harry,
who was a longtime Boston judge, and late brother Clarence, who
once ran a campaign of former US Senator Ed Brooke of
Massachusetts, she has made her own distinction in years of work
overseas and in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Elam, whose fascination of the ``world beyond Boston'' grew out
of a summer college undergraduate program in France, now is acting
deputy director and counselor of the US Information Agency.
</P>
<P>
   She has served in Greece, Turkey, France, Senegal, Mali and the
Ivory Coast. She learned Greek and Turkish on the job. The Greek
and Turkish governments separately gave her awards for improving US
cultural relations with both countries.
</P>
<P>
   And she was thinking about retiring this fall, more than a
little unnerved by the dangers of being a diplomat overseas. She
had seen colleagues killed in terrorist acts in Greece and Turkey,
and then came the bloody US embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania
last August.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department had talked to her about other
ambassadorships, but she had passed. Then they asked her about
Senegal, and she couldn't say no. Senegal was her first posting
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a particular affinity for Senegal,'' she said Friday
from her home in Arlington, Va. ``And I thought there was something
I could do to allow the Senegalese to know that when President
Clinton went there last year it wasn't just to window dress. He has
a genuine commitment when he talks about trade and not just aid to
Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Elma Lewis, the founder of the National Cener of
African American Artists, was overjoyed with the news of Elam's
nomination. Lewis is a friend of the Elam family and has known
Harriet since the day she was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was born the day I turned 20. That was my birthday
present,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the nomination was long overdue. ``I can't even have
imagined how they waited this long,'' she said. ``She is a Roxbury
girl from the beginning, from the time she was born, from Roxbury
Memorial High School, from St. Mark's Congregational Church, from
Simmons College, she's been a beacon in this community. I love
her.''
</P>
<P>
   John P. Dwyer, deputy associate director of information at USIA,
said many in Washington feel similarly. ``She has a tremendous
number of friends. Harriet is a very principled person,'' he said.
``She is very traditional, very strict, very sort of
work-your-way-up type of attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Elam now is preparing for her Senate confirmation hearings and
studying issues relating to Senegal and Africa. Vast numbers of
African-Americans have traveled to Senegal especially in the past
two decades to learn more about their heritage. For many of the
slaves in bondage for America, the last African stop was the
Senegal island of Goree.
</P>
<P>
   She left Senegal in 1974 as a junior officer. If confirmed, she
could take up her post in October. Such a return, she said, ``would
be particularly sweet.''

FEC DENIES TELLING BUSH CAMP NOT TO FILE CAMPAIGN REPORT
ELECTRONICALLY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's aides said his record $37
million presidential campaign finance report was not filed
electronically this week because the campaign was discouraged from
doing so by the Federal Elections Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But FEC officials said that was not the case at all and that
Bush had actually been encouraged to file electronically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not discourage the Bush campaign from filing
electronically,'' said FEC spokesman Ron Harris. ``We had been
looking forward to them filing electronically.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of his campaign finance reform package, Bush has said he
favors instant disclosure of campaign contributions on the Internet
as soon as a candidate receives them.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said Bush filed paper copies of his report and said the
cover pages have been scanned in for voters to view at the agency's
Internet site: www.fec.gov. But Harris said it will take several
weeks for staffers to type the Bush report into a searchable
database of individual donors.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush campaign spokesmen Mindy Tucker and Scott McClellan
said the FEC discouraged the campaign from filing electronically
because of ``glitches'' in the FEC software and what impact the
massive report would have on the FEC computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were concerns at both ends because of the enormous size
of it,'' McClellan said. ``Apparently there were some concerns
about the download time.''
</P>
<P>
   McClellan noted the report is available on the campaign Internet
site: www.georgewbush.com.
</P>
<P>
   However, that report on the Bush site is a jumbled mess that has
city names in the columns for zip codes; zip codes in the columns
for occupation; and contributions listed in the column for dates of
the donations.
</P>
<P>
   The report also cannot be searched by various categories; for
example, a researcher could not figure out what contributions came
from a particular city or from people of a particular occupation.
</P>
<P>
   A searchable electronic database of Bush's contributions had
been given to the news media by the campaign Thursday, but not to
the FEC or the public at large.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Bush's first flap over campaign finance reports.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1994 campaign for governor, Bush had promised to file
campaign reports electronically with the Texas Ethics Commission.
But he quit immediately after the election. Bush only filled in the
gaps in his electronic filings after being challenged by the
Houston Chronicle on his failure to keep a campaign promise.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had promised in April to file his July presidential
campaign finance report electronically after he missed filing his
first report electronically with the FEC.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said Bush will file his next presidential campaign
report electronically.

 &HT;    Candidates head to Ohio
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ When U.S. Rep. John Kasich withdrew from the
presidential race this week and endorsed George W. Bush, it sent a
signal to other Ohio Republicans that Jeff Jacobson heard loud and
clear:
</P>
<P>
   Get on the Bush bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich, from Westerville near Columbus, dropped out Wednesday.
On Thursday, Jacobson, who had endorsed Kasich, switched to Bush,
the Texas governor and son of former President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's all over,'' said Jacobson, chairman of the
Montgomery County Republican party and a state representative from
Phillipsburg. ``The (county) party does not officially endorse in
presidential races, but I endorsed him as party chairman and as a
state representative.''
</P>
<P>
   Before ``it's all over,'' Bush still must survive a gauntlet of
caucuses and primaries to win the GOP nomination and then defeat
Vice President Al Gore or whomever the Democrats nominate in the
November 2000 general election.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, however, Ohio Republicans are treating a Bush
fund-raiser in Cincinnati on July 22 almost like a coronation.
</P>
<P>
   It's Bush's first campaign visit to the state and the goal was
to raise $500,000 _ a goal that had been exceeded by the middle of
this week, said Buck Niehoff, Hamilton County Republican chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's visit is also the first of three major political
fund-raisers in Ohio within in seven days. President Bill Clinton
will be in Cincinnati for a fund-raiser Friday, July 23, and on
July 29, Gore will be in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Republicans are saying they expect Bush to leave
Cincinnati with $1 million. Tickets are $1,000 a person for the
fund-raiser to be held at the Omni Netherland Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually with fund-raising we're begging and kicking and
twisting their arms,'' Niehoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time, he added. ``It's a seller's market.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush fever has captured the political headlines in Ohio
and across the country, Democrats, too, have stepped up their
campaigning and fund-raising in the state.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Bush's trip, Clinton will be in Cincinnati to raise
money for the Democratic National Committee at the home of attorney
and prominent Democratic fund-raiser Stan Chesley. The event
originally was scheduled for March but was postponed because of the
war in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Then on July 29, Gore will be in Cleveland for a fund-raiser at
the home of industrialist Michael Siegal. Former U.S. Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, Gore's only current opposition for the
nomination, plans to be in Columbus on Sept. 2 for his own money
raising event.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, said political scientist John Green,
presidential politics are settling into their normal pattern in
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohio is as important as it's always been,'' said Green,
director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the
University of Akron. ``If your campaign plays in Ohio, it probably
will play nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Kasich's departure did was loosen up the pocketbooks
of Ohio Republicans, Green said. ``With Kasich stepping out, the
floodgates opened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are ready to open their hearts as well as their bank
accounts, said Jacobson. There's an enthusiasm and feeling that
Bush is a winner. That attitude was lacking in 1996 with former
Sen. Bob Dole, Jacobson said.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, he said, Republicans felt: ``Well, it (backing Dole)
is the only way to go to the convention. At least the convention
will be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's path to the March 7 primary in Ohio will not be obstacle
free, said Ohio Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell, national
chairman for Republican publisher Steve Forbes' presidential
campaign. By the primary, the Republican race in Ohio will be
between Forbes and Bush, Blackwell predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have a clear choice between a status quo-oriented,
establishment candidate (Bush) and an independent tree shaker and
thinker (Forbes),'' Blackwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, not surprisingly, also are unconvinced of the
inevitability of a Bush victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean George W. `Muskie' Bush?'' joked former Ohio
Democratic Chairman Ruvolo. He was referring to former secretary of
state and Sen. Edmund Muskie, who appeared to have the 1972
Democratic nomination locked up only to falter and drop out,
leaving the Democrats with George McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has a network of Ohio supporters _ including contributors _
developed during the 1992 and 1996 Clinton-Gore campaigns, said
Richard Cordray, a former state representative and, with Ruvolo, a
key Ohio contact for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats feel good about the fact that this president-vice
president team has brought the Democrats back to being
competitive,'' Cordray said.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean all of them want Gore to be the nominee, said
Bob McAllister, a Columbus attorney and long-time Democratic
activist. McAllister is helping put together the Sept. 2 event for
Bradley, whose talk on race in America particularly impressed
McAllister.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is there's going to be a (Democratic) primary in
Ohio,'' he said.

<P>
   OXFORD, Miss. _ On a recent steamy day at the University of
Mississippi here, the Prince song ``1999'' blasted from
loudspeakers as high-pitched yells of ``go'' and ``fight'' rose
from a sea of nearly 1,000 brightly clad teen-agers scattered in
clusters in the middle of campus.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one cluster, 21 girls from Mount Pisgah Middle School in
Cordova, Tenn. _ wearing identical yellow shorts, white tops
emblazoned with their school logo, and maroon bows in their hair _
sprang into action. The cheerleaders danced, jumped, back-flipped,
and formed a human pyramid in sync with the music, smiling so
intently that some looked as if their braces might burst through
their cheeks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The scene will be repeated many times this summer as more than
400,000 cheerleaders attend camps like this one on college campuses
around the country to learn new moves, perfect old ones and check
out the competition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The camps, which usually last three or four days and cost just
$150 to $200 per person, combine with regional and national
cheerleading competitions and uniform sales to make up what
insiders call ``the spirit industry.'' And a thriving industry it
is, with more than a million active participants, tens of millions
in revenues and nationwide television coverage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 95 percent of the participants are girls, although there
are plenty of male cheerleaders. In fact, their ranks include
notables like the two U.S. senators from Mississippi, Trent Lott
and Thad Cochran (both cheered at the University of Mississippi),
Steve Martin, Ronald Reagan and Dwight D. Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the national spotlight turns to women in sports like
soccer, volleyball or basketball, cheerleading's popularity does
not seem to have wavered. For in the last 20 years or so, the
spirit industry has evolved into a dynamic business, with
cheerleading growing more athletic, more competitive and more
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has also come to include school dance teams and
pompom squads as well as dance studio participants and cheerleading
squads called all-stars, who do not actually cheer for a team but
exist only to compete. All those groups need uniforms, and many
attend a summer camp at one time or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The camps create the market for us,'' said Jeffrey G. Webb,
49, chief executive of the Varsity Spirit Corporation, based in
Memphis, an industry leader. ``It's a virtual circle of
cross-marketing. We know from our research that most kids enter
that circle through the camps. And we use our camps to promote our
special events _ our competitions. And while we don't sell uniforms
at camps, our sales reps come there, meet with customers and make
presentations.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The strategy has clearly worked on the Mount Pisgah squad. For
six years they have come to camps run by Varsity's camp and
competition division, the Universal Cheerleaders Association. They
buy all their uniforms and gear from the Varsity catalog, and they
compete in the association's national competition every winter at
Disney World in Orlando, Fla., telecast on ESPN. In 1995, they were
the champions of the junior high division. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Smith, 42, one of the mothers who accompanied the squad
to camp this year, along with their coach and their faculty
adviser, said it cost about $5,000 a year for her daughter,
Christie, 12, to be a cheerleader. That includes summer camp, camp
clothes (different matching outfits for each day), uniforms,
warm-up outfits, coaching, gymnastics classes and travel expenses
to regional and national cheerleading competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend most of the year fund raising,'' Ms. Smith said. ``We
do car washes, baby-sitting, sell poinsettias, anything to offset
the cost. Each girl's parents have their own account, and we each
put in at least $200 per month. It is like a car note.'' In her
case, two car loans, since her 16-year-old daughter, Casey, is a
cheerleader at Cordova High School.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting a handle on the actual size of this industry and its
market is difficult.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, while many companies run camps and competitions and many
others sell uniforms and equipment, Varsity Spirit and its main
rival, the National Spirit Group, of Dallas, are the only two that
do all three and have a nationwide scope. Varsity Spirit was bought
in 1997 by Riddell Sports Inc., which makes football helmets (and
whose chairman is Robert Nederlander, of the Broadway
Nederlanders). In 1997, Varsity's last year as a separate company,
its revenues were $90 million, and National Spirit's were estimated
at $80 million.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next, no one is sure just how many cheerleaders are out there.
American Sports Data, a research firm in Hartsdale, N.Y., estimates
3.3 million. That includes all children 6 and older, but Varsity
and the others see their market starting at 11 or 12, the age when
children generally join school squads and are old enough to go to
overnight camps and competitions. Varsity puts the number of
cheerleaders and other spirit team members in that market at 1.5
million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, asking spirit companies about their size or their
markets is not always much help. In typical cheerleader fashion,
they all claim to be the best, the leader, No. 1.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But another indication of the size of the market is a
five-year-old company, Lifestyle Ventures in New York City, which
publishes six related magazines, including American Cheerleader,
with a circulation of 200,000 and a readership of 1.2 million.
Michael Weiskopf, the publisher, said the industry had grown more
sophisticated in the last decade at finding ways to tap into the
spending power of cheerleaders and dance team members, who are
influential within their larger peer group of teen-age girls. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Weiskopf said the corporate cultures at Varsity, National Spirit
and their smaller rivals had peculiarly good and bad aspects. ``You
get the sense the employees, who are mostly former cheerleaders,
would do anything for their company,'' he said. ``They are very
loyal. There is an organic enthusiasm. It is fun. It could be the
model for an IBM. The downside to that is they have that
cheerleading mentality of let's go out and kill the competition, so
there is not a lot of cohesion or coming together for the good of
the industry.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Webb, Varsity's chief executive and a former University
of Oklahoma cheerleader, used to work for his main competition. He
was hired out of college by National Spirit's founder _ the man
credited with creating the spirit industry, Lawrence Herkimer,
known in the cheerleading world as Herkie. Herkimer started the
first cheerleading camps in the 1940s, and in the '50s he came up
with the idea of the pompon and patented it, propelling him into
the uniform business. For years, in fact, his company was the sole
producer of pompons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Webb left National Spirit after two and a half years and formed
Varsity Spirit in 1974, setting up camps in direct competition with
his old employer. In 1979, he started manufacturing uniforms, the
most lucrative segment of the business, generally accounting for
about 60 percent of revenues. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Varsity began national competitions, which were picked
up by ESPN in 1984 and have been televised ever since, with an
average viewership of 500,000 households. Not to be outdone,
National Spirit's camp and competition division, the National
Cheerleaders Association, also developed national competitions that
are now televised on CBS, the USA network and Fox. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now those in the industry are looking to conquer other realms.
Both Varsity and National Spirit mention expanding into uniforms
for other women's and some men's sports. Varsity took a step in
that direction when it signed a U.S. licensing agreement last year
with Umbro, the British soccer uniform manufacturer. For the next
five years, Varsity will manufacture and sell soccer uniforms for
boys and girls, under the Umbro name, to American school and league
markets. Webb said the company hoped eventually to apply the same
cross-marketing model of camps, competitions and uniform sales to
soccer as they had to cheerleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer is more like cheerleading than any other sport,'' Webb
said, ``because it grew up outside the school and doesn't have all
the regulations. Most soccer is played at the club level in this
country. Kids travel to tournaments all the time. And they buy
their own uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school doesn't decide, he added. ``So there is a really
big fashion element to soccer. Fabric and trim and design are
really important.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb said that would fit well with the kind of custom uniforms
the spirit industry was in the business of providing. Just as it is
with cheerleading, he said, ``in soccer everyone wants to have a
really hot look.'' &QL;

HARVARD TO DIP INTO $13B ENDOWMENT TO HELP TEACHING HOSPITALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Harvard University plans to inject more than $20
million into its four major teaching hospitals to prevent medical
students from getting short shrift in their clinical training.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 percent boost in funding, to be spread over five years,
will come from the university's burgeoning endowment, medical
school officials said _ unless the stock market falters.
</P>
<P>
   The money will help support the training of the 400 third- and
fourth-year Harvard medical students who are based in teaching
hospitals at any one time. In a time-honored apprentice system,
students learn at the bedside and in the clinic how to take
patients' medical histories and do physical exams _ the first steps
beyond textbook learning of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's largess is thought to be nationally unique _ largely
because no other university comes close to Harvard's $13 billion
endowment, of which more than $1.5 billion belongs to the medical
school. The medical school has the largest endowment of any Harvard
division.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Medical School Dean Joseph B. Martin said the unusual
increase in endowment payout is designed to relieve pressure on the
financially beleaguered hospitals and on hospital-based Harvard
faculty, who are scrambling to see more patients in less time to
sustain their incomes and subsidize undergraduate medical training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past year we've seen that many of our best teachers
are also the most busy trying to earn their living by seeing
patients,'' Martin said in an interview. ``Each time they step
aside to see students or lecture, that puts increased pressure on
their livelihood.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospitals _ Massachusetts General, Brigham and Women's, Beth
Israel Deaconess and Children's _ are ``under incredible financial
pressures,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare funding has been slashed, managed care's market
penetration has increased, and insurance reimbursements have either
remained flat or have fallen. . .making it difficult for our
hospitals and faculty to carry out their academic missions,'' the
dean said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hospitals are in very grave financial straits,'' he added.
``This isn't just an issue of crying wolf.''
</P>
<P>
   Although other medical schools' investments have also been
buoyed by rising investment portfolios, no other comes close to
matching the 102 endowed Harvard professors based in teaching
hospitals. The medical school has added 25 endowed chairs in just
the last seven years as part of a capital campaign that concluded
last month _ $25 million ahead of its $280 million target.
</P>
<P>
   Each endowed chair at Harvard Medical School is backed by $2.75
million. With the new increase in endowment payout, each chair will
produce $123,750 in annual income. But much of clinical professors'
incomes is derived from patient care.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Rosenblatt, faculty dean for academic programs at
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, called the additional medical
school support ``substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very important move, both in real dollars and
symbolically,'' Rosenblatt said. ``The dean is saying the academic
mission in teaching hospitals is important, and he's standing by us
and doing more than the medical school has done in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear, however, whether many other medical schools can
follow Harvard's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``While other schools have hospital-based professors, in terms
of magnitude Harvard's endowed clinical faculty are substantially
greater than anyplace else,'' said Robert Dickler of the
Association of American Medical Colleges in Washington, which
represents the nation's 125 medical schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's terrific,'' Dickler said of Harvard's decision to
increase support for undergraduate hospital training. ``This is not
an inconsiderable sum of money, and the spirit is significant
because it shows how strong the partnership is.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $4 million a year in additional endowment
funds, the medical school is freeing up as much as $1.9 million a
year in funds previously earmarked for professors' fringe benefits,
if the faculty members also have health insurance and other
benefits through their hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said many clinical professors have had ``essentially
duplicate coverage'' of fringe benefits. ``We're allowing them to
use these funds for academic purposes now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Harvard seven months ago announced it will start
paying out annually an extra $95 million in endowment income
university-wide, of which $11 million will go to the medical
school. This additional payout is in addition to the $20 million
the school has newly earmarked for hospital-based teaching.
</P>
<P>
   The new $20 million endowment payout will be reviewed annually
over five years in light of the performance of the university's
stock portfolio, Martin said. ``If the stock market comes
completely apart, we'd have to modify it each year, but I think we
can be pretty optimistic,'' the dean said. ``I'd hope this would
become a five-year rolling commitment.''

PILOTS MAY BE NEAR DEAL WITH AMERICAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Airlines and its pilots may be close to settling the
dispute that inconvenienced hundreds of thousands of passengers
earlier this year when pilots called in sick, forcing the airline
to cancel nearly 6,700 flights.
</P>
<P>
   The Allied Pilots Association, which represents American's 9,500
pilots, said its 18-member board would consider a proposed
agreement drawn up by George Nicolau, the federal mediator who has
been working with the union and American's parent, AMR Corp. The
seven-month-old dispute stemmed from AMR's acquisition of Reno Air,
a small Western airline, and disparity in pilots' pay.
</P>
<P>
   American, the nation's second-largest airline after United
Airlines, has already agreed to the proposal. But it is still
subject to a vote by the union's board, which will decide in the
next few weeks, said union spokesman Gregg Overman. ``The board
will debate and vote to accept or reject,'' he said. ``Until that
happens, we don't have an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say whether the union's leaders and negotiating
committee would endorse the proposal. Both American and the pilots
union also declined to say what was in the proposed settlement. Two
people with knowledge of the deal said, however, that it included
retroactive salary payments to Reno's 300 pilots and a subagreement
that would spell out how American would handle future mergers.
</P>
<P>
   After AMR took control of Reno on Dec. 23, pilots at American
accused the company of violating a key clause in their contract
that guarantees that all flying be done by members of their union.
They demanded that American immediately begin paying the Reno
pilots at the higher levels of American pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said that pilots' demands would add as much as $50
million to the $124 million cost of the Reno acquisition. It said
that fully integrating Reno into the American network could take up
to 18 months and that it would gradually increase the pay of the
Reno pilots as they assumed their new American jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But hundreds of pilots, fearing that the company was trying to
set a precedent that might hurt them later if AMR acquired a much
larger airline, called in sick in February, and American canceled
thousands of flights at a cost of $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge declared the job action illegal and ordered the
pilots to return to work. He later found the union, its president
and vice president in contempt and ordered them to pay American
$45.5 million in damages. Earlier this week, the union gave formal
notice that it would appeal the order. Any settlement between the
company, which is based in Dallas, and its pilots would not affect
the fine and the court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed accord, which was reported on Friday by The Fort
Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram, would give the Reno pilots retroactive
pay raises dating to March 1 and June 1. A third increase on Sept.
1 would bring them to parity with American pilots. It is not clear
whether a 10 percent increase that the Reno pilots already received
from American on June 1 would count toward the raises negotiated in
the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the proposed accord is approved, other contentious
issues would remain. A big one is resolving how much seniority the
Reno pilots, who are represented by a different union, the Air Line
Pilots Association, will get at American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seniority is everything,'' said one Reno pilot. It determines
where and when they fly, their pay and even the size of their
retirement benefits. The American pilots union has proposed simply
putting the Reno pilots at the bottom of their seniority list,
while the Reno crews want credit for their years at the smaller
airline.

PICKED UP AND DUSTED OFF, A SKI CHAIN STARTS ANEW

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 18)  
 (af)  
 By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By late last week, word had spread around the Killington area in
Vermont, where the economy depends upon the ski trade, that
something even better than a heavy snowfall was on its way. It was
a heavy downpour of cash.
</P>
<P>
   An investment group controlled by the Texas billionaire Robert
Bass had agreed to buy $150 million of convertible preferred stock
in the American Skiing Co., the debt-laden owner of the Killington
ski area and eight other resorts in New England and the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it seemed to be a peculiar move for someone as
sharp as Bass, considering that the stock market value of the
company is slightly less than $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal gives the group, Oak Hill Capital Partners, a 48.5
percent stake in the company and infuses enough money into the ski
conglomerate to help it finish some of its projects and pay off
part of its more than $400 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   The deal came in the nick of time. Coming out of a rough winter
of little snow and few skiers, American Skiing was forced to cut
the pay of some employees in Killington and elsewhere and to lay
off others. It also put an inn, a golf course and other assets up
for sale. With $95 million in accounts payable as of April, and a
$7 million interest payment due this month, scant summer revenues
would not fill the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Wall Street firms that American Skiing had hired to pin
down money, Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and ING Barings, were
coming up empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had shopped around a similar deal, a convertible
preferred, to the usual cast of suspects _ other financial buyers,
strategic partners and existing shareholders,'' said Christine
Lumpkins, a ski industry analyst with Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two months, nothing came through, possibly because
American Skiing's chairman and founder, Leslie B. Otten, who had
built up the company from one resort in 1994, did not want to give
up control. He currently owns 50.1 percent of the stock, and the
restructuring will reduce his stake to 26.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   David O'Leary, who follows American Skiing for Alpha Equity
Research in Portsmouth, N.H., said the deal was a necessary one for
Otten, but not a good one for some American Skiing shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you bought the stock at $18, you've got to be pretty angry
that they are selling half of the company for $5.25,'' he said.
American Skiing made its initial public offering in November 1997
for $18 a share. The stock dropped to a low of $2.375 in April and
closed at $4.8125 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the stock market value of the company was only $146
million on Friday, ``the value of all of those assets is worth more
than that stock is selling for,'' said John J. Rohs, an analyst
with Schroder &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   American Skiing has begun millions of dollars' worth of
development on hotels and time-share apartments at many of its
properties, including Steamboat in Colorado and the Canyons in
Utah, which must be completed for the 2002 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Hollis Rafkin-Sax, a spokeswoman for Oak Hill, said Bass and his
partners were long-term investors who saw potential in the resorts
under construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many are less developed than their competitors, and real
growth opportunities,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary noted that Oak Hill stands to make at least $63.75
million from an 8.5 percent dividend over the next five years,
after which it must convert its preferred stock to common stock.
And if American Skiing has another bad winter this year, he said,
the arrangement means that ``Oak Hill gets paid before Les Otten
gets paid.''

COURT CRACKS DOWN ON ELIGIBILITY OF PETITION FORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a unanimous ruling that will make it more difficult
to get initiative petitions on the Massachusetts ballot, the state
Supreme Judicial Court Friday ruled that any extraneous markings --
even inadverent doodles -- on a ballot signature sheet will
disqualify the signatures on that sheet.
</P>
<P>
   The high court in a opinion written by Justice Ruth Abrams,
ruled against a school choice group seeking to change the state
constitution to permit aid to private and parochial schools. The
group filed the initiative petition last year, but 3,507 of their
signatures were disallowed because they were on sheets which
contained extraneous markings The disallowed signatures left the
group short of the 57,100 signatures needed.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State William F. Galvin said the court's ruling
``puts a great burden on collectors to keep the papers pristine.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, he said, proponents of initiative petitions will
need more signature collectors and the ruling may even spur the
growth of a cottage industry of professional signature collectors
which has already sprung up.
</P>
<P>
   Among the markings on the challenged sheets were the names of
towns and cities where the signatures were collected, the name of
the signature collector, underlining of text in the summary of the
peoposed petition, and highlighting of instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin wanted the court to permit state officials to rule on the
validity of such signature sheets on a case-by-case basis. He said
neutral marks which neither mislead nor advocate should not
invalidate a petition. But Galvin maintained the the court's
``bright line'' rule places to great a burden on the intiative
process.
</P>
<P>
   The court was emphatic, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statute does not permit any alterations of forms whether
by copying machine, petition circulator or petition signer,''
Abrams wrote. ``This burden is not onerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Petitioners are allowed to make copies of the original signature
form issued by Galvin's office but they must be exact copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exact copy means exact copy.'' the court said, rejecting the
argument that it was restraining the right to file a petition or
have one's signature counted.
</P>
<P>
   The court said the law requires ``circulators and signers not to
scribble, doodle, highlight, underline or write extraneous
information on petitions.''
</P>
<P>
   The court noted that the signature forms issued by Galvin's
office contain a clear warning: ``Do no alter this petition form in
any way. Additional markings on this petition will disqualify any
signatures on this page.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Michael C. Gilleran, who represents the school choice
group said the ruling was a temporary setback but will only
galvanize his group to go out and seek even more signatures this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, he agreed with Galvin that the ruling may lead
to more groups hiring professional signature gatherers who ``know
all these arcane rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be carrying their petitions around in glass jars so
that not a rain drop or coffee stain will fall on them,'' he said.

HEWITT COMES THROUGH   THE FURNACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ George Bernard Shaw knew a lot about a lot,
but he didn't know much about sport.
</P>
<P>
   Youth, he should be informed, is not always wasted on the young.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Bill Russell once famously observed, ``Experience don't
mean (expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   If you're good, you're good. It's just that every once in a
while, you've got to do something for the first time, and in this
case it just so happened that this was ponytailed Lleyton Hewitt's
first taste of Davis Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to get out there and play again,'' beamed the
Adelaide-bred 18-year-old. ``It was a fantastic atmosphere out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Backed by a vocal, yellow-clad, face-painted band of Aussie
``fanatics,'' Hewitt ignored both the oppressive heat and the
nationalistic hoopla and simply played a superior brand of tennis.
Experience played no role in what Lleyton Hewitt did to Todd Martin
at Longwood Cricket Club Friday. It was all about talent,
athleticism, heart, and a rare gift for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Two professional tennis players met in triple-figure heat on a
hard court in the first match of the Davis Cup quarterfinals
between Australia and the United States, and the 18-year Australian
just plain whupped the 29-year-old American, and whupped him good.
It was 6-4, 6-7 (1-7), 6-3, and then a crushing 6-0, and if it had
gone on any longer, Martin might have been forced to resort to a
Hingis-like underhand serve in order to keep the match alive.
</P>
<P>
   There may be sports in which age helps, but tennis is not
necessarily one of them. We are numbed to female precocity in the
realm of sport, but in tennis, even the men can be early bloomers.
Boris Becker won Wimbledon at age 17. John McEnroe did most of his
damage well before his 25th birthday. If you are young, you are
likely to be quick, and if you are quick in this game, you have a
huge advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has a way to go before he gets ticketed for the tennis
glue factory, but his legs had 11 more years of wear and tear, and
it showed. He couldn't reach half the balls young Hewitt could, and
that wasn't even the worst part. The kid actually out-moxied him,
thrice dropping clever, point-winning lobs over the 6-foot-6-inch
Martin's head.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there's a tennis brain up there, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can generalize about young guys,'' mused
Martin, ``or even old guys. Lleyton has great nerves. He seizes big
occasions and attacks. He never reacts negatively to any situation.
He's like Pete (Sampras) in that way. It's not because of youth;
it's a nature thing. A 17-year-old can choke on his tail, and a
40-year-old can be a great competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that it never entered Hewitt's mind that he wasn't
going to win. Was he nervous? Absolutely. ``It was actually pretty
tough to go to sleep last night,'' he admitted. ``I was trying to
have an early night, but then really couldn't get to sleep for a
couple of hours. I just got on the phone, called the folks back
home and all the mates.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also comforted by the presence of the irrepressible John
Newcombe as team captain. ``Newc kept me pretty calm,'' Hewitt
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's all well and good, but eventually the moment comes when
the support system lets go, and then it's just you and the other
guy, in this case a not-so-mobile American whom you played in
Sydney six months ago and whose deficiencies dovetail nicely with
your strengths. Yes, Martin won that match, but you were hardly
intimidated. In your heart, you knew you could beat this guy, and
you knew how.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a lot of confidence out of that match,'' Hewitt
confided. ``I was pretty tired at that time and just made the final
at Adelaide; that was the quarterfinals of Sydney and then I came
back and really gutsed that out. I think that was in the back of
Todd's mind _ that I was not going to go away out there today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hewitt game plan Friday was simple, direct, and relentless:
make Martin move. ``His biggest weakness is a lack of mobility,''
Hewitt said. ``I tried to jag him side to side.''
</P>
<P>
   That tactic, when combined with a big serving day and better
overall stamina in the blast-furnace heat, led to what was, in
truth, a rout. Hewitt never lost serve. What he did lose was a
tiebreaker in the second set, but even that buoyed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Todd started to get a little tired during that
set,'' said Hewitt. ``I lost, but I came away with a positive
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   As Martin pointed out, nothing fazes Hewitt, not even losing the
fourth game of the third set to four straight Martin aces. ``That
happens,'' Hewitt shrugged. ``You can always lose a game like that
to a big server. That's what makes (Andre) Agassi great. He'll give
up some aces to a (Mark) Philippoussis or an (Goran) Ivanisevic and
just keep right on going.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the Hewitt response was to win the next three
games, blowing Martin away with his own serve, breaking Martin with
a powerful forehand winner in the next game, and then serving a
40-30 ace to construct an insurmountable 5-2 lead in the pivotal
third set.
</P>
<P>
   So let's not worry about this 18-year-old stuff. That's a man
out there.
</P>
<P>
   So what we know is that he's definitely got game. What we will
need to find out is how badly he wants to be great, because not all
of them do. At the moment, he's just an enchanting growth stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly better now than he was in January,'' assessed
Martin, who has surely seen this type of prodigy before. ``I assume
that progress will continue. But it's hard to say if he'll wind up
as a top-5 player. He will always have the ability to beat top
players. But whether he will be a great player week in, week out
remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a conversation for another day. Friday, when his country
and his mates needed him, Lleyton Hewitt was a great player. To
quote another American coach of note, in the context of this
competition, the Australian future is now.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ ``It is good for everyone to know how to forget,'' the
French historian Ernest Renan observed in 1882, and to preserve
national unity France has often chosen to overlook the most
uncomfortable moments of its past.
</P>
<P>
   But not President Jacques Chirac, who four years ago boldly
acknowledged French complicity in the Nazi-ordered roundup of
thousands of French Jews on July 16, 1942, in the Velodrome d'Hiver
stadium in Paris. And on Friday he went to a village that the
Germans wiped out in 1944 to say that barbarity was possible ``in
all countries and in all times.''
</P>
<P>
   Chirac inaugurated a visitor center in Oradour-sur-Glane, a
village whose ruins are preserved as the SS ``Das Reich'' Division
left them after killing 642 men, women and children on June 10,
1944. In his remarks, he put Oradour in a long list of other
brutalities beginning with the massacres of Protestants in Catholic
France in 1572 and continuing through the killings of Kosovo
Albanian civilians by Serbian forces in Kosovo this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Despite revulsion over the Holocaust, genocide had been
attempted again in Rwanda, he reminded his country. And like
Oradour in France and Lidice in Czechoslovakia, other places like
Srebrenica in Bosnia and the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee
camps in Lebanon have become symbols of human brutality, he said,
alluding to the failure of European peacekeeping forces to stop
Bosnian Serbs from killing Muslims in 1995 and the failure of
Israeli forces occupying Beirut to prevent killings in the
Palestinian camps in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oradour and all the martyrs remind us that barbarity is
possible in all countries and in all times,'' Chirac said. ``Europe
has no higher meaning than to be the contrary of what happened in
Oradour by incarnating a dream of peace and a humanist ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   The SS division that laid waste to Oradour included volunteers
and conscripts from Alsace, a French territory annexed by the
Germans when they invaded. Nine years later, the citizens of
Oradour returned the decorations that had been awarded to the
village by the postwar French government after 14 Alsatians were
first tried and then, after mass protests in Alsace, the Parliament
in Paris voted to give 13 of them amnesty. An Alsatian volunteer
who was sentenced to death was later pardoned.
</P>
<P>
   As an American author, Sarah Farmer, pointed out in her book on
Oradour, ``Martyred Village,'' published by the University of
California Press this year, even Gen. Charles de Gaulle, the
Resistance leader and Chirac's political mentor, had pleaded for
understanding of Alsatian sensitivities in the interests of
preserving national unity.
</P>
<P>
   That concern remained paramount in France as long as Francois
Mitterrand, Chirac's predecessor, was in office; Mitterrand himself
had served in the French collaborationist government in Vichy
during part of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But Chirac's speech in 1995 acknowledging French guilt, and the
trial and conviction of a prominent postwar official, Maurice
Papon, in 1997 and 1998 for crimes against humanity as a Vichy
functionary in Bordeaux, changed the climate.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was the first time elected officials in Oradour, where
2,000 people now live in a new village that was built beside the
ruins of the old one after the war, agreed to let the mayor of
Strasbourg, the Alsatian capital, come and make a gesture of
reconciliation. The French state provided $2 million of the nearly
$10 million it cost to build the visitor center, and gave more than
$200,000 last year to help keep the ruins from crumbling into
oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Lamaud, a guide in the village whose sister, who was 4 at
the time of the massacre, was among the people killed by the Nazis,
tells visitors the lesson of Oradour is the evil of fanaticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the young people among you will learn the lesson and
not let yourselves be indoctrinated,'' he told one group recently.
``What happened here can happen anywhere, and indeed it continues
in other places even today.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamaud, born a year after the massacre, said his parents were at
a wedding in a nearby village on the day of the massacre.
``Otherwise, I wouldn't be here,'' he explained.

 &HT;    24-hour cartoon channel a strategy shift for Turner
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Turner Broadcasting will launch its second cable TV
channel featuring all-day and all-night cartoons next spring.
</P>
<P>
   To be called Boomerang, the channel is to begin airing April
Fool's Day. Boomerang's launch will also mark a shift in strategy
for 7-year-old sister channel Cartoon Network.
</P>
<P>
   Cartoon Network will focus on airing original cartoons, while
Boomerang will feature cartoons from the company's Hanna-Barbera
library.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boomerang will serve baby boomers and kids ages 2 to 7,'' says
Cartoon Network President Betty Cohen. ``These people have told us
they want more of the old Hanna-Barbera cartoons.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Cartoon Network will be marketed more to
middle-graders, teen-agers and young adults. They favor
contemporary animation.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, about 30 percent of Cartoon Network's schedule
consists of original cartoons such as ``Dexter's Laboratory,''
``PowerPuff Girls'' and ``Johnny Bravo.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of these original series run in prime time, 7 p.m. to 9:30
p.m. Monday through Thursday and up to 11 p.m. on Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   To boost original production, Turner Broadcasting is creating a
separate animation studio for Cartoon Network.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Cartoon Network animators work out of the Los
Angeles-based Looney Toons division of Warner Bros. Studio. The
studio is a unit of Time Warner, which owns Turner Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   The size of Looney Toons, one of the world's largest animation
houses, has apparently become a problem for Cartoon Network's
animators.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our creators wanted the feel of a small studio,''
says Cohen. She wants to make her animators happy, because ``the
success of our shows are affected by the talent we can attract.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting will lease a separate building and renovate
it into a state-of-the-art facility in Los Angeles. Cohen says she
hopes to have her animators moved into a new studio by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Boomerang, to be announced today in Los Angeles, comes as the
Cartoon Network is on a roll. The channel won the second-highest
rating on cable TV during the past six months, according to
Nielsen. That rating beat out its biggest competitor, Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   Boomerang's creation is reminiscent of a strategy Turner
Broadcasting followed with its TNT and Turner Classic Movies
channels.
</P>
<P>
   At first, TNT featured old movies from Turner Broadcasting's
vast film library. But the channel switched to airing original
movies, films made in the 1970s and 1980s and live sports
programming as it gained a wider audience.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting then moved its old movies to a new channel,
Turner Classic Movies.

 &HT;    Dole wants more limits on Net
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Trailing badly in the polls and in fund-raising,
Republican presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole brought her
campaign _ and a new campaign issue _ to Atlanta on Friday,
advocating federal restrictions on access to Internet pornography
in public libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Librarians shouldn't use federal tax money to put pornography
on their shelves, and they shouldn't put it on their desktops or
laptops,'' Dole said during a news conference outside the
Atlanta-Fulton County Public Library's main branch.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who appeared in Atlanta the same day as fellow GOP
contender Gary Bauer, endorsed a congressional proposal to require
pornography filters on computers used by children at the 26,000
U.S. schools and libraries that have received $1.7 billion in
federal grants for Internet connections. But she said the
legislation doesn't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under this bill ... pornography is off limits to children, but
it's readily accessible to adults,'' Dole said. ``That's wrong.
That's not what libraries are for.''
</P>
<P>
   Librarians said Dole is trying to solve a problem that doesn't
exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Libraries have appropriate-use policies for the Internet, the
same way they have other policies governing appropriate library
use,'' said Linda Wallace, a spokeswoman for the American Library
Association. ``It's not a widespread problem. That's not what
people use libraries for.''
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent of U.S. libraries have installed software on
their public-access computer terminals that blocks access to online
pornography. But the association contends that the software doesn't
always work as intended; one program, it says, blocks such sites as
one devoted to professional golfer Fred Couples and another on Mars
exploration (the Web address innocuously contains the word
``sex'').
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Atlanta-Fulton County library did not respond
to requests for an interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dole was undeterred by questions about the necessity of the
pornography ban, as she was by questions about her political
viability. A recent poll of Republican voters by CNN and USA Today
showed her running 51 percentage points behind the front-runner,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Through June 30, she had raised $3.5
million, including $75,600 in Georgia. Her total is less than
one-tenth of Bush's $37.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in time, I'd say probably less than 5 percent of
the American public is even engaged in presidential politics,''
Dole said. ``I think that people, when they get involved in the
campaign, are going to be looking at who has the most experience to
bring to the table, not who has the most money.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, who held a news conference Friday outside Fort McPherson
south of Atlanta to advocate higher defense spending, noted that
his campaign had raised $3.4 million, almost as much as Dole's.
</P>
<P>
   But he said: ``Politics is about more than money. If it wasn't,
we would now be finishing Ross Perot's second term.''
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The path to reconciliation in the Middle East can
fairly be said to have begun 21 years ago at Camp David, where
Egypt's Anwar Sadat and Israel's Menachem Begin agreed to end their
nations' enmity and live in peace as neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The next recent stretch of that tortured road to peace may have
been mapped out at Camp David over the past 24 hours, as Israel's
new prime minister, Ehud Barak, described for President Clinton the
steps he intends to take to reach a comprehensive settlement with
the Palestinians and his Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton telephoned from a political trip to Iowa on Friday
afternoon to describe how he and Barak lingered Thursday night in
the cabin where Sadat and Begin concluded their bargain. Barak, the
most decorated soldier in Israel's history, pored over documents
from that time, many with the handwritten annotations of President
Jimmy Carter, who served as midwife for the Egyptian-Israeli
accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``He read it all with great care,'' Clinton said. ``He talked
about Sadat, what a gutsy thing he did when he came to Jerusalem to
talk to the Knesset even before the agreement was signed. He
described the scene and what an important effect it had.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he declined to talk in detail about what he had heard,
Clinton said he was moved by Barak's commitment to peace and by his
awareness of the risks it entails. Sadat was assassinated by Muslim
radicals in 1981. Barak's mentor, Yitzhak Rabin, was murdered in
1995 by an Israeli who opposed his efforts to make peace with the
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   The visit to the cabin where the Sadat-Begin talks took place
was a part of a long evening for Clinton, Barak and their wives.
They talked over a dinner of cold fennel soup and fish for more
than two hours, then Clinton and Barak spent three and a half hours
together, breaking up well past midnight.
</P>
<P>
   They spoke of their families and their politics, history and
health, war and peace, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laughed about a lot of things,'' Clinton said, including
what he called the ``peculiarities of politics.'' He would not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that despite Barak's reputation for dourness, he is
a ``generally cheerful person.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton believes that personalities and relationships can
fundamentally alter history, and he said he is hopeful that this
positive early start with Barak can help lead to substantial, rapid
progress in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he stood ready to do whatever is necessary _
even if that means stepping out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said this week that the United States had played an overly
intrusive role in Middle East talks over the last three years. He
said he would welcome American participation as a ``facilitator''
of dialogue, but not as an arbitrator of disputes or enforcer of
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Friday that he understood Barak's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best peace process is one where critical decisions are
made with parties that have to live with the consequences,''
Clinton said. ``When they hit a bump in the road, someone
facilitates the next step.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you want is for the U.S. to be a genuine facilitator, to
make whatever helpful suggestions we can and be there to provide
whatever support we can for making the most difficult decisions. I
think that is the right thing to do. We can be honest mediators,
fair and sensitive to concerns of both sides, of all the parties.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Barak hope that a close political and personal
bond between the Israeli leader and the American president can be
forged once again.
</P>
<P>
   Relations were cool to the point of frost under Benjamin
Netanyahu, the former prime minister, who made no secret of his
resentment of American interference in Israeli affairs. The Clinton
administration made little effort to conceal its desire for Barak's
electoral victory over Netanyahu in May.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was warm in his assessment of Barak, saying, ``I like
him. I can get along with just about everybody. The main thing is
the Israeli voters basically said, `We want you to pursue peace
with security and we want it concluded.' Because of his
distinguished military career, they were saying to him, `We trust
you to try to put this deal together, to protect our security but
complete the peace process if you can.'''
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli official who spoke with Barak after his White House
and Camp David meetings with the president said the prime minister
was ``most satisfied'' with his discussions with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Barak described the two couples' dinner as ``intimate and
warm,'' and he said the Baraks were quite taken by the beauty and
serenity of Camp David, in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains about 80
miles northwest of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After the dinner, the president and prime minister sat down
privately as their wives engaged in a talk of their own. Mrs.
Clinton and Mrs. Barak share an interest in women's health issues
and in programs for troubled youths. Mrs. Clinton said she would
like to visit Israel soon, according to the Israeli official who
was briefed on their discussion.
</P>
<P>
   They also spoke of their children. Chelsea Clinton is a student
at Stanford University; the Baraks have three daughters, one of
whom works at the New York law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP;
Flom. The other two live in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Baraks and the Clintons had a quick breakfast Friday at Camp
David before flying off in different directions, Clinton to Iowa
for political appearances, Barak to Washington and then to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   They resume their visit on Sunday, at an official dinner at the
White House for 400 guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I took away from it, frankly, was what a lively
intelligence this guy has and what incredible energy he has,''
Clinton said. ``He said a lot of people know a lot of facts about
history but often lose the forest for the trees. You have to
understand the big patterns in history and in politics to make the
right decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know he is a passionate patriot,'' Clinton concluded. ``It
was fascinating to hear him talk about the history of Israel. I
could have stayed up all night listening to him, but we both got
tired.''

research and writing as they struggle to win tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Painting your own house is not something you even think about
anymore,'' said Robert Frank, a tenured Cornell professor today who
did his own painting as an assistant in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Software engineers at Xerox are similarly afflicted. A few
sometimes get their work done by 5 p.m., says Leslie Perlow, a
University of Michigan sociologist who has studied software
engineers at Xerox and other technology companies. But they dare
not go home, fearful that their bosses might conclude they are
shirkers who stick to the easiest assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how to assess the value of a knowledge worker in
these new technologies, so we value those who work into the
night,'' Ms. Perlow said.
</P>
<P>
   There is much debate over whether Americans are spending more
time at work or at leisure, and which activities to call ``work''
and which ``leisure.'' But two things are clear: People on fixed
salaries for a 35-hour or 40-hour week are the fastest-growing
segment of the work force, and increasingly they work beyond their
weekly schedules for no extra pay.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department's surveys have found that workers who say
they toiled 49 hours or more a week have risen to nearly 19 percent
of the private-sector work force, from 13 percent in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Even John Robinson, a University of Maryland sociologist who has
challenged such data, is beginning to come around. He argues that
survey respondents tend to exaggerate when asked to recall how many
hours they have worked, and he prefers data from time diaries, in
which each day's activities are recorded that day. His diary-based
figures showed Americans spending fewer and fewer hours at work
until 1985, but gradually more since then.
</P>
<P>
   People are still exaggerating, Robinson said: they tell
pollsters they worked, say, 60 hours in a week when they actually
worked only 50. ``But there are more people now in the exaggerating
class,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No sector of the work force is growing more rapidly than workers
on fixed salaries: managers, administrators, engineers,
technicians, lawyers, researchers, programmers, consultants. They
constitute roughly 40 percent of all workers today, up from 34
percent in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Such workers rarely get overtime pay, particularly those earning
more than $40,000 a year. And the changing nature of work in
America adds to the pressure on them to work more hours.
</P>
<P>
   The new pressures include some obvious ones: more competition;
more people vying for fewer tenured slots, like those at Cornell;
the reluctance of corporations to offer job security over a
lifetime. But there is also what sociologists describe as a shift
away from routine, repetitive work that can be packaged in
eight-hour days. The new mode is ``project'' work that must be done
in a hurry, often without clearly defined guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Senior managers at the technology companies studied by Ms.
Perlow often bid on software projects by promising to deliver in
two months when everyone knows three months are required, she said.
But even in routine trades like commercial baking, the new mode of
work appears.
</P>
<P>
   For example, many bakeries once filled standing orders from
neighborhood stores, said Richard Sennett, a New York University
sociologist who has studied bakeries. The work was routine.
Supervisors and workers knew their daily tasks. But now many
bakeries vie for orders from all over a city, and the supervisors
find themselves constantly changing work schedules or ingredients,
tasks that add hours to their workdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are manual labor in this process, it shows up in your
hourly wages,'' Sennett said. ``If you are a salaried employee, the
sky is the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing number of hours worked by salaried workers is not
yet reflected in some key Labor Department statistics, leaving the
impression that America's economic performance is better than it
probably is. For example, the nation's productivity _ output for
each hour worked _ has risen rapidly in recent years, suggesting
that corporate America is becoming more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates productivity using
the hours reported by employers, not employees. For salaried
workers, the bureau often is working with scheduled hours, not
actual hours. What's more, the bureau assumes that supervisory
workers in the service sector _ a category where hard numbers are
lacking _ work roughly the same amount of time as hourly,
nonsupervisory workers.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that the hours worked by as many as 16 percent of
all workers are probably underreported, bureau officials said.
Undercounting hours has the effect of exaggerating the nation's
productivity growth and hourly wages.
</P>
<P>
   That is the arithmetic. The psychological aspect is more
ingrained. ``We have incorporated the longer hours into our
self-image,'' said Stephen Rose, a labor economist, ``and we have
come to accept that to be really successful you have to work a lot
of hours.''

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; There was a trace of eulogy in the young day trader's voice as
he reflected on how different the world looked after April, a month
in which once-sizzling Internet stocks began a steep slide that cut
the sector's value by at least 20 percent in just nine weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come to grips with the fact that it's never going to be
as good as it was,'' said John Cassimatis, 27, who has been trading
Internet stocks exclusively ever since they became the dream
machines for the would-be rich last year. ``But I'm just grateful
to have been a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassimatis is one of an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 amateur
investors _ mostly men, mostly young _ who have flocked to more
than a hundred specialized trading rooms around the country to try
their hands at buying and selling stocks quickly for their own
profit. Since early last year, their role in the market has assumed
an almost mythical quality. Some regulators worry that these new
players, who have shown a special affinity for Internet stocks, are
being lured toward the rocks with siren songs of instant wealth,
while others blame them for causing thin, rumor-driven markets to
become so turbulent that less agile investors are drowning.
</P>
<P>
   Like many at-home investors who trade online, day traders were
drawn to the Internet stocks by their volatility and triple-digit
gains, and for many of them, trading in the months before the
spring sell-off was like breaking the bank on some high-tech video
poker machine. Is that time, however, gone for good? Has the
cruelty of April left these new market players wary, wiped out or
disillusioned?
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with self-employed traders across the country suggest
that the Internet slump, however brief, has planted a few doubts in
this preternaturally optimistic community. Managers at brokerage
firms catering to day traders report that in the early weeks of the
sell-off, there were fewer new customers, while existing customers
were trading less actively. Like Cassimatis, many young traders
said they did not expect the near-term future of the Internet
sector to look like its glorious pre-April past.
</P>
<P>
   But a few more experienced voices predicted that this new-found
caution would be forgotten quickly if Internet stocks, which have
regained about half the ground lost in the April slide, move past
their pre-slump highs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think greed is built in,'' said Eyal Shahar, 38, a trader
who manages the Irvine, Calif., branch of Momentum Securities &UR;  &LR; in
Houston, the largest of the day-trading brokerage houses.
</P>
<P>
   Trading Internet stocks is something ``only the very good
traders should get into,'' he said, ``because you can lose so much
so fast, before you learn how to trade.'' But, he added, ``in most
cases, they need to experience it in their own skin before they
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Day traders try to make money by exploiting the
minute-to-minute, hour-to-hour movements in specific volatile
stocks. Nowhere has their impact been felt more keenly than in
Internet stocks, a tiny corner of the market until the fall of
1997, when Yahoo began to attract their hair-trigger attentions.
</P>
<P>
   The sector then comprised only a few companies, each with only a
few million shares available in the market. As enthusiasm for the
stocks spread, demand for shares outstripped the supply. The
resulting price gains of the newborn dot-com stocks became the
stuff of legend.
</P>
<P>
   One young day trader ticked off the milestones, starting with
the date that seemed to capture all that was magical about the
Internet craze: April 9, 1998, when Yahoo announced its earnings,
opened $8 higher, paused and then began a noontime rally that
carried it up another $8, for a total gain of $16, or 16 percent,
on tremendous volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``That started it,'' said Kirk Kazazian, 23, who has been day
trading since receiving his bachelor's degree in finance at the
University of Pennsylvania in 1996 and now trades with Tradescape
in Manhattan. He rattled off the ticker symbols of tiny stocks he
had held onto for brief but steep climbs. ``Everything started in
April,'' he said. ``That was my best month.''
</P>
<P>
   In late summer of 1998, of course, Internet stocks were caught
in a wholesale market panic prompted by the Russian debt default.
But by November, they were showing resilience. On the day before
Thanksgiving, ``things really started to fly,'' Kazazian recalled.
By February of this year, Internet stocks were moving into the thin
stratosphere of pure euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we were both catching the wave and causing it,''
Kazazian reflected recently. ``There weren't but about 30 or 40
stocks. So we'd start bidding them up, and then people at home
would see it going up, and they'd bid it up higher.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's not just us. Everyone wants to get into it and
make a fast buck.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider one stock popular among day traders: Theglobe.com. The
big money on this unseasoned Web-site operator was made last Nov.
13, when its newly minted shares made their debut at seven times
their offering price of $4.50, adjusted for a subsequent split. But
in the post-April slump this year, the stock plummeted from nearly
$40 to less than $14 _ a fairly typical performance in the sector.
It now trades at $17.875.
</P>
<P>
   Many day traders emphasized that a declining market could still
produce profits, so long as it remained volatile and a trader had
more current data and quicker order execution than online brokerage
customers could obtain from their home or office computers. On a
recent day when Theglobe.com closed lower, for example, there were
several points at which a sharp-eyed trader could have pocketed 25
cents a share by buying at one momentary low price and quickly
selling at a slightly higher one.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement and challenge of such trades are what attract
many investors to the trading rooms. Arthur E. Herrmann, 27, first
experienced that thrill from the sidelines when he worked as a
summer intern for a specialist firm on the floor of the American
Stock Exchange. Now, he says, ``this is my career.'' He usually
trades at a Manhattan office of Tradescape, which merged recently
with Momentum Securities but for now continues in business under
the Tradescape name. But he visits other branches, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trade light and fast and generally go out flat,'' he
explained in the patois of the day-trading world. In translation,
that means he buys a relatively small number of shares, holds them
for an extremely short period and ends the day with nothing but
cash in his portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Herrmann said he doesn't worry much about where the Internet
stocks are heading _ if they cool, he said, he'll play in another
neighborhood. Nevertheless, he senses a mood change _ though it
might be only seasonal. ``It has been a really crazy time, and now
it's summertime, and people are probably just going to be more
laid-back for a while,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Herrmann, the real casualty of the post-April slump was the
initial public offering game. ``I have tended to stay away from the
IPO action lately,'' he said. ``It is too much of a frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   What would it take to bring him back? ``I would need another
Theglobe.com,'' he said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Peter C. Earle, an executive vice president of On-Line
Investment Services, allowed a reporter to visit On-Line's
day-trading room near the rehabilitated waterfront in Jersey City,
N.J., on condition that his customers' last names not be used _
``in the interests of maintaining their privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an environment that gives ``business casual'' a new
dimension _ sandals, shorts and rumpled T-shirts were the office
uniform _ but the technology is up to the minute, and more than a
dozen customers were busy trading on a recent afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was Brian, 28, who played drums in a band and
managed a sporting goods store in Boston before gravitating to day
trading more than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As he tells it, he started with $50,000, lost money for six
weeks and broke even for six months. Finally he began to build an
account that now allows him to trade as much as $250,000 of stock
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Like Herrmann, he cashes out at the closing bell and does not
hold stocks overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, it was free money,'' he said, reflecting on
the pre-April paradise. ``There's a lot more nervousness now.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Everyone in the room has been wondering how to
handle this.''
</P>
<P>
   His own trading style has been affected by the current mood, he
said. ``I'm trying to be more picky, more selective _ which I think
everyone, across the board, has been trying to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John, 29, comes in early, usually by 7:30 a.m., and tries to
scout stocks that have been neglected by other traders, building
positions during the day that range as high as $1 million _ ``maybe
for a minute,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the last few months have been a puzzle to him and his
trading-room friends. ``We all feel it's going get tougher and
tougher,'' said John, who began day trading about three years ago,
after trying unsuccessfully to get a job at a big brokerage house.
``I'm a pessimist. Over the past year, the opportunities have been
unbelievable. I'm not going to say it's never going to happen, but
I just don't think Yahoo is going to double or triple from here.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We have been on a great bull run, but a bear market
will wipe out a lot of day traders.'' He acknowledged, ``this isn't
a stepping stone to Goldman Sachs.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, day trading ``grabs you'' and ``it's hard to get
out, especially if you're successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Though day trading has grown more challenging since the Internet
stocks peaked, few day traders have buckled down to doing the kind
of homework that more selective trading demands.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lanigan, 52, who trades with Momentum Securities in
Houston, avoids Internet stocks. Early last week, she was amused to
find that many of the young traders around her, who tend to focus
solely on the internal rhythms of the trading day, were mystified
that Yahoo was slumping despite apparently good earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seen the negative story in Barron's on Saturday,
analyzing the quality of those earnings,'' she said. ``They
hadn't.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``Here, most young traders would rather go to Mexico
for the weekend than read up on stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazazian, the 23-year-old Manhattan trader, was more optimistic
than many, saying recently that ``mid-June looks like it might have
been the bottom.'' But he agreed that the days were gone when one
could play any Internet stock and make money. ``I think the days
ahead will separate the blue chips from the junk,'' he said,
laughing a bit at the notion of using ``blue chip'' to describe
anything as ephemeral as an Internet stock.
</P>
<P>
   The people who make their living by catering to this new
category of self-employed traders have not been daunted by the
recent Internet roller-coaster.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Schwenke, 38, a former corporate marketing executive _ ``I
was once manager of jigsaw puzzles for Golden Books
Entertainment,'' she said _ entered the day-trading world about two
years ago by helping to set up La Salle Street Trading, an
affiliate of Momentum in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to own my own business, but I don't want to
bake bread or frame pictures _ I'm just not very good at that,''
Ms. Schwenke said. ``This is a business I have really grown to
love.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, office start-up chores took up her time. But about
six months ago, she was finally able to begin day trading herself,
using what she calls a ``pure scalping'' style in which she holds
stocks for less than a minute before selling. ``It's been a slow
start,'' she said. ``But I'm learning, and will be ready when
things pick up.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent downturn in Internet stocks ``certainly changed some
people's perspective,'' Ms. Schwenke said. ``You didn't have that
wind at your back, when the volume always seemed to be there. That
has made the market much tougher to trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said, she has gained some customers lately from among
the burgeoning population of active online traders who have left
their home computers in search of better technology and faster
execution of their trades.
</P>
<P>
   James H. Lee, the president of Momentum Securities in Houston
and of the Electronic Traders Association, pointed out that April
was ``an absolutely extraordinary month'' in trading volume and
that May and June might reflect a more normal pattern.
</P>
<P>
   While Lee, speaking on behalf of the association, said he
expected trading volume from on-site day traders to grow, he
acknowledged that the overall number of people involved in day
trading had not changed much in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   But that may merely reflect the arithmetic confronting firms
that cater to day traders, he said. An online brokerage firm spends
roughly $250 for each new customer, Lee estimated. By contrast, he
said, an on-site day-trading firm may spend $30,000 on each new
customer, counting the outlay on equipment, office space and
training. Since the firm charges a fee for each trade, it may not
begin to recoup that investment until the new customer has become
secure enough to trade actively.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of growth Lee claims for the day-trading population
hasn't reduced the criticism from regulators. Early this month,
Massachusetts securities watchdogs sued Landmark Securities Corp.
in Houston, accusing its Boston branch of signing up customers who
should not have been allowed to pursue the risky life of a day
trader and then extending credit to them on usurious terms. Pete
Oppel, a spokesman for Landmark, said the company ``has been and
will continue to discuss the matters with Massachusetts
authorities, but we are not willing to discuss them in the
media.''The case was the sixth that Massachusetts regulators have
filed against day-trading firms.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and others say that most of the evils attributed to day
traders are the work of at-home speculators who trade through
online brokers. Day traders seem to dismiss the regulatory cases as
growing pains. ``They can't turn back the clocks,'' said Chris, 27,
who trades at On-Line in Jersey City. ``Day trading has already
established itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Many traders said they thought the post-April slump would help
their new community to mature _ to hone its skills and judgment.
</P>
<P>
   But every upward leap in the Internet sector may well dislodge a
little bit of the caution that began to take root among day traders
in the post-April sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   People are more selective now, said Brian, the wary young trader
in Jersey City, ``but you only stay cautious until you start making
money.'' Then, he said, ``once some more frenzy starts, people will
go back to the old style.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, with a grin, ``This has been a big reality check, but
people forget.''

COURT HALVES JAIL TERM OF EX-PRESIDENT'S BROTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In a new twist involving this country's most
despised family, a Mexican appeals court Friday cut nearly in half
the prison term for Raul Salinas de Gortari, brother of a former
president, who was convicted of ordering the murder of a political
rival.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, a Swiss court overturned an attempt by
prosecutors to confiscate $114 million of Raul Salinas's assets.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas, 52, the brother of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Mexico's
president from 1988-1994, had been sentenced to serve 50 years in
prison for authorizing the killing of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu,
a former brother-in-law and a leader of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   But an appeals judge, responding to petitions filed in January
by Salinas's lawyers after he was convicted and given the maximum
sentence, cut that term Friday to 27 years and 6 months.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, which was read at a courthouse in Toluca, about
35 miles west of Mexico City where Salinas is being held, Judge
Tomas Hernandez cited the overall weakness of the prosecution's
case and skepticism about the government's use of paid witnesses
who said they heard Salinas order Ruiz's death.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas's conviction was seen as a watershed for Mexico's
chronically corrupt political and judicial systems, where
high-level politicians, their families and associates have always
been considered above the law.
</P>
<P>
   But even the judge in the first trial aknowledged that the
government's case was based mostly on circumstancial evidence and
offered no direct link between Salinas and Ruiz's fatal shooting on
a Mexico City street in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Luongo Creel, one of Salinas' attorneys, told TV Azteca
television network that although they were pleased with the reduced
sentence, ``we will keep fighting because we're confident that in
the end he will be proven innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's Attorney General's Office said it disagreed with latest
ruling, adding that there was ``sufficient evidence found to
sustain'' Salinas' responsibility in the case. Prosecutors also
vowed to keep working on other charges pending against Salinas,
such as illegal enrichment and misuing public funds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Switzerland, a federal tribunal overturned the
confiscation of more than $114 million that Salinas had deposited
into Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   The funds were seized in November by Swiss prosecutors, who
suspected the money was being laundered because it allegedly came
from drug dealers. The tribunal ruled that federal authorities
should have deferred to local officials. The money remains frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Both rulings were seen as victories for the Salinas brothers,
who are still viewed by many Mexicans as symbols of their
government's abuse of power and the cause of a severe 1995 economic
crisis. Carlos Salinas, who has been in self-imposed exile in
Ireland since 1995, staged a brief return to Mexico last month,
when he publicly supported his brother's innocence.

U.S. DRUG CONTROL CHIEF SEEKS $1 BILLION FOR COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>

   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Alarmed by recent advances by Colombian
guerrillas who are involved in drug trafficking, the Clinton
administration's top anti-drug official is asking that the United
States make $1 billion in emergency assistance available to the
Colombian government to strengthen its efforts against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The request by Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of the Office of
National Drug Control Policy, comes as Colombia's defense minister
and the chief its armed forces are in Washington on an official
visit. In meetings on Thursday and Friday, the Colombian military
officials said they were seeking an additional $500 million in U.S.
aid over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are preparing modern armed forces that, if peace can be
achieved, will guard our borders and natural resources,'' Defense
Minister Luis Fernando Ramirez said on Thursday. ``That is the
country we dream of. But we are also preparing the armed forces for
war, if need be.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of attacks beginning July 8, units of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the country's principal
left-wing guerrilla group, came within 25 miles of the capital
before being driven back. On July 10, President Andres Pastrana
imposed a limited curfew in 10 of Colombia's 32 provinces but has
also said he plans to go ahead with peace talks with the guerrillas
that are scheduled to begin on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey's recommendation, which would dramatically increase
U.S. support for Pastrana if approved, calls for $1 billion in
``emergency drug supplemental'' assistance for Colombia and other
drug-producing countries during the fiscal year beginning in
October.
</P>
<P>
   The request is contained in a letter and discussion paper he
sent to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Attorney General
Janet Reno, copies of which were obtained by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said Friday that Albright had
received the letter but that no decision on the request had been
made. Congressional Republicans have generally assistance for the
Colombian government in drug eradication efforts and in its
campaign against guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting with Ramirez and Gen. Fernando Tapias in
Washington Friday, McCaffrey said he would ``not publicly discuss
the details'' of any recommendations he has made to other U.S.
officials. But he made it clear that he strongly favors the
Colombians' request for increased U.S. support and announced plans
for a three-day visit to Colombia at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia is in a near-crisis situation,'' he said. ``This is
an emergency.'' He added that, because ``criminal trafficking
organizations have done serious damage to Colombian national
security over the past few years,'' the United States has an
obligation to ``support the Colombian government as it attempts to
reassert democratic control over its drug-producing regions.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing Thursday at the School of the Americas at Fort
Benning, Ga., Gen. Charles Wilhelm, commander-in-chief of the U.S.
Southern Command, played down recent guerrilla gains. He said the
insurgents ``have not had a single real tactical success.'' But at
the same time he seemed to acknowledge the Colombian military's own
problems on the battlefield, saying they are ``not losing'' their
war against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Formally, all U.S. aid to Colombia, which produces most of the
world's cocaine and most of the heroin consumed in the United
States, is intended for anti-drug rather than counter-insurgency
efforts. But in practical terms, the distinction is fading, as
Tapias made clear Thursday when he said, ``The aid we are seeking
is to fight drug-traffickers and any group that helps them.''
</P>
<P>
   After meeting several U.S. senators on Thursday, Ramirez said
Colombia wanted the money to buy more military helicopters,
interceptor planes and radar equipment. In remarks carried in
Friday's newspapers here, he said the Colombian government also
``hopes to obtain on loan some of the equipment the Southern
Command had at Howard Air Force Base in Panama'' before closing
operations there in May.
</P>
<P>
   But the McCaffrey proposal would provide much more aid in a
shorter time than the Colombians are seeking. According to the
letter, the emergency aid would include $360 million to bolster
existing anti-drug operations in southern Colombia, and an
additional $130 million ``to establish Colombia's ability to
interdict in southern Colombia,'' a region increasingly dominated
by the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The United States argues that eradication efforts have
substantially reduced coca growing in the Guaviare region, a
traditional cultivation area. But recent satellite images indicate
a surge in coca and heroin poppy cultivation in the Putumayo and
Caqueta areas, which are largely under guerrilla control,
contributing to a 25 percent increase in the past year in the
acreage devoted to growing drugs in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Under the McCaffrey proposal, Colombia would also receive $30
million to ``enhance regional intelligence programs'' in order to
``increase collection and improve assessments'' of information
obtained by satellites, radar and electronic intercepts. An
additional $200 million would also be earmarked for improving U.S.
interdiction efforts in the air and sea lanes north of here.
</P>
<P>
   A study published by the Government Accounting Office last month
revealed that the United States had begun sharing intelligence on
guerrilla activities with the Colombian government in March.
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Benning on Thursday, Wilhelm acknowledged that U.S. and
Colombian military officials had been in constant communication
throughout the weekend, appearing to confirm Colombian news reports
that devastating bombing attacks on the guerrillas were based on
information provided by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Any increase in aid to Colombia would have to be approved by
Congress, which has sought to bolster the Pastrana government ever
since it came to office last August.
</P>
<P>
   With the enthusiastic support of leading Republicans like Rep.
Benjamin Gilman, Congress agreed last November to more than triple
U.S. assistance to the government here to $289 million, making
Colombia the largest recipient of U.S. security aid after Israel
and Egypt.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When he was 8, Leo Marks broke his first code, a cost
code in a signed first edition of ``The Gold Bug'' by Edgar Allan
Poe. He was looking at the book in his father's London bookstore at
84 Charing Cross Rd. (yes, the store in Helene Hanff's popular
memoir of that title). From then on, he said, he had two ambitions,
to learn as much as he could about codes and to be a writer,
possibly of movies, his favorite Saturday afternoon pastime.
</P>
<P>
   In a lifetime filled with excitement, Marks, now 78, fulfilled
both goals. As a code maker for the British government during World
War II, he played a pivotal role in his country's sabotage
operations against Germany. Years later he wrote the film ``Peeping
Tom,'' about a cinematographer as a serial killer, a movie that
Martin Scorsese linked with Fellini's ``8{'' as ``two great films
that deal with the philosophy and the danger of filmmaking.''
</P>
<P>
   As a third chapter in his life, Marks has written a book,
``Between Silk and Cyanide: A Codemaker's War, 1941-1945'' (Free
Press, $27.50), about his wartime exploits. Working for the
mysterious Special Operations Executive, he created secret codes
for British agents gathering information behind enemy lines. In
contrast to Alan Turing, Britain's most famous code breaker, Marks
spent most of his time inventing codes that others tried to break.
</P>
<P>
   As the author recalled during a recent interview over lunch in
New York, he was only 22 when he signed on with the agency. In 1940
Winston Churchill gave that code center a mandate to ``set Europe
ablaze'' with sabotage. The headquarters on Baker Street, where
Marks spent four years, was considered ``an open house for
misfits,'' he said. In keeping with that perception, he was
outspoken and mischievous and therefore often in trouble with his
superior officers. But he had a genius for his assigned task, which
was to make codes and also find new methods to protect agents if
they were captured by the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   The basic code system was based on poetry, with each agent
choosing five words from a poem. To create a code, the letters were
changed to numbers according to a series of rules. The message was
understandable only to someone who knew the original code. Marks
wrote many of the poems himself, leading him to say in his book,
``I hadn't thought that writing poetry would be my contribution to
Hitler's downfall.''
</P>
<P>
   As Marks discovered, one weakness with this method was that the
slightest error in transmission could result in the message being
indecipherable and furthermore, because the agent was supposed to
memorize the code, he could be tortured into revealing it.
</P>
<P>
   His solution was something he called Worked Out Keys, or WOKs,
with a series of codes transferred to a piece of silk. Each code
would be used to send only one message. Then it would be cut from
the silk and burned. In other words, with WOKs the code kept
changing, and, he concluded, it could not be tortured out of the
agent because he would not know the actual one until he used it.
Furthermore, the silk could be hidden under clothing and would be
undetectable in any initial body search.
</P>
<P>
   When Marks was asked what effect silk codes would have on agents
in the field, he answered that it was the difference ``between silk
and cyanide.'' The assumption was that if an agent was caught, he
would not have to swallow a suicide pill but could hide behind the
silk.
</P>
<P>
   In common with Marks' other innovations, it was not easy to
convince officials of the efficacy of his project. Help came from
Col. Elder Willis, who was an expert on camouflage. He created a
process by which a code would be invisible on the silk until it was
struck by an ultraviolet flashlight. He also invented a pencil that
if passed over the surface would completely erase the letters.
Marks finally overcame the officials' skepticism, and his method
was accepted.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, he says that Anthony Quayle was the only actor who
was a successful spy. Most actors were hopeless, he said, because
they had a tendency to overdramatize. ``We even had Noel Coward for
a while,'' he said. ``He was a genius in his way, but as an agent,
he hopelessly overacted.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the cryptographers were safely ensconced in their
building on Baker Street and never saw action, it was, he said, an
excruciating time of his life. ``When an agent was tortured, we
experienced the torture with him. All that mattered was bringing
him back.'' But the relief of being able to rescue some agents was,
he said, ``nothing compared with the knowledge that they were
tortured by the thousands.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When the war ended, Marks accepted one brief government
assignment, then left coding behind. ``It was a saturation point,''
he said. He never thought about entering his father's business for
at least one odd reason. He loves books, he said, ``but I don't
love books that have been used by agents,'' and agents had checked
the books at 84 Charing Cross Rd. to find poems to use for codes.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Marks finally met Churchill. He told him he was
glad to move from coding into writing. He remembered Churchill's
response: ``I too wish I could have devoted further time to my
writing, but other events intervened.''
</P>
<P>
   Marks wrote a play that was produced on the West End in London
in 1948, then he became a screenwriter. Explaining the shift in his
career, he said, ``There comes a moment when there are other codes
to be broken than those that are cryptographic.'' One of those
other codes became the movie ``Peeping Tom.'' It was, he said,
conceived in the war. ``While watching a group of Norwegian agents
without appearing to, I concluded that cryptographers were
voyeurs.'' Because at the time he was obsessed with photographing
codes on silk, he decided to write a film script about a
photographer. But in the film the voyeur resorts to violence. ``It
was my impression that code-making and code-breaking are also
concerned with violence,'' he said. When ``Peeping Tom'' was
released in 1960, it was a shock to fans of the director, Michael
Powell, who was known for such artful, romantic films as ``The Red
Shoes'' and ``I Know Where I'm Going!'' The reception in London
destroyed the director's career for the next 14 years. Marks
continued to write films, but ``Peeping Tom,'' which has since been
accepted as a classic film, remained the hallmark of his movie
career. Years later he was the voice of the Devil in Scorsese's
``Last Temptation of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   About 10 years ago, he decided that it was time to tell the
story about his days and sleepless nights as a code maker. ``When
you think about facing the Supreme Indecipherable,'' he said with
his customary dramatic flair, ``it's almost an obligation to tell
certain things.'' He had kept some of his papers and assumed that
he would be able to refer to three long reports he had written for
the code agency during the war. But two of them had disappeared,
along with his box of poems for agents. The only report that
remained was a curious paper called ``Ciphers, Signals and Sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his code work actually helped win the war, he said:
``It helped preoccupy the Germans and waste their valuable time.
Perhaps the most satisfying part of the job was Operation Gift
Horse, deliberately making our codes look easy to break, giving the
enemy all the clues they were looking for and hoping to waste their
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The work of agents, he said, ``set a standard of courage,
endurance, ingenuity and integrity, which was not matched in
peacetime.'' He added that the wartime experiences had a crippling
effect on some people: ``Nothing seemed worthwhile or interesting
after what they had survived. There were those who determined to do
what they could to ensure that it wouldn't happen again.'' One of
those, of course, was Marks, who wrote his book to illustrate ``the
spirit of resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the interview, he took out a bundle of silks, all
lettered with codes. He placed the silks on the table, handling
them with delicacy as if displaying precious ornaments. As he
explained his method, he pretended to be talking to an agent on
assignment: ``The enemy is all around you,'' he warned. ``If you're
caught, they'll try to break you.'' Hearing those words, the couple
at the next table glanced at him in astonishment.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The novel collaboration between Dow Chemical and
environmentalists in Midland, Mich., to curb toxic chemical
releases, can be traced back to a 1991 gripe session over drinks in
a bar in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Greer, a policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense
Council, and Richard A. Olson, then an environmental manager at
Dow, had been among the lobbyists locked in clause-by-clause combat
over proposed hazardous waste disposal regulations that the
government began developing in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had spent the last year fighting over the definition of
solid waste and agreed that neither of us was doing anything for
the environment,'' Ms. Greer recalled. They felt that the
regulations were not only too complex but also misguided,
addressing wastes after they were created instead of preventing
them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Greer did not believe Olson, though, when he contended that
existing regulations actually prevented Dow from reducing its waste
production. She asked for real-world proof. And after some internal
debate, Dow and the NRDC agreed to study the company's polyurethane
factory at La Porte, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The study had many elements of the Michigan project, including
the central role of Bill Bilkovitch, an outside consultant hired to
ferret out pollution-reduction opportunities. It found that
pollution could be reduced profitably, and that business practices
_ not regulations _ were preventing the reductions. Still, none of
Bilkovitch's proposals were adopted.
</P>
<P>
   One weakness was that the proposals were filtered through the
factory's environmental, health and safety managers rather than
taken directly to the business managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, it looks amateurish,'' Ms. Greer reflected.
``We had no direct contact with the people who have to write the
checks.''
</P>
<P>
   David T. Buzzelli, who was a vice president in charge of
environmental affairs at Dow, told Ms. Greer that he thought the
company could do better if a project was designed with action
rather than research in mind. And Dow has proved that point in
Midland, Ms. Greer said. Now she is wondering how to insure
progress where environmental groups are not so directly involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to think about what kind of regulation might make it
happen with less hand-holding,'' she said. ``It's not obvious to me
yet.'' &QL;

BOSTON DOCTOR SUCCESSFULY SEPARATES JOINED TWINS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- When they first arrived at Children's Hospital in
March, identical twins Hassan and Hussein Mohamed were a cranky,
crying pair of infants, said Dr. Hardy Hendren, the legendary
pediatric surgeon who treated them.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all,'' noted Hendren recently, ``they were in each
others' face all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   They had no choice. The infants, born last December, were joined
front-to-front from their chests to their genital areas. Only by
arching their backs could they gain some individual space. Inside
their bonded bodies, their abdominal tissues were fused, their
urinary tracts were tangled, and they had but one penis between
them.
</P>
<P>
   But in late June, the boys lay apparently content in individual
carriers being readied for the trip to their home in Abu Dhabi.
They now seemed much like any other six-month-olds: happy and
mellow, with shining eyes and cheerful gurgles.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan and Hussein were separated on April 5 in a complex,
25-hour operation led by Hendren, known for his skillful repairs of
some of the most severe birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic case wasn't disclosed until Friday because the
parents agreed to release the story first to media in Abu Dhabi
upon their return.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hendren who performed the first separation of Siamese
twins in Boston 30 years ago at Massachusetts General Hospital.
Those twins, Maureen Ann and Marie Elizabeth Kobierski of Danvers,
Mass., were joined in a similar fashion as Hassan and Hussein. The
Kobierskis are still living in the Danvers area.
</P>
<P>
   The name Siamese twins comes from the most famous of
``conjoined'' male twins, Chang and Eng, born in Siam of Chinese
parents in 1811. They became exhibits in P.T. Barnum's circus for
many years; although never separated, they married and fathered a
total of 22 children. They died within 2 hours of each other in
1874.
</P>
<P>
   Separating conjoined twins remains a rare procedure. Hendren, a
former World War II Navy fighter pilot, has now separated 15 pairs
in his long career. He noted that his main operating room nurse at
the time of the Kobierskis' operation, Dorothy Estes, was on hand
to assist him in the surgery on Hassan and Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Separating Siamese twins is always a difficult and risky
undertaking. The operation to free Hassan and Hussein from each
other was especially complex because the urinary and reproductive
organs were so abnormally situated.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are `thinking' cases,'' said Hendren, who at age 73 is
still renowned for his stamina and creative problem-solving in
treating the most devastating birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to see what you have to work with, and think about
what you're going to do. It's improvisation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The team led by Hendren included the chief surgical resident,
Dr. Ann Fischer, and the chief urological resident, Dr. John Park.
</P>
<P>
   The gruelling operation began at 7:30 a.m. April 5 and didn't
conclude until 8:30 a.m. the following day. ``You can't stop until
you get all the parts figured out,'' said Hendren, who said from
the surgeons' point of view it was like ``doing two liver
transplants back to back.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the twins' hearts were not joined. Still, Hendren
and his team had to separate the two livers and two stomachs as
well as two small intestines. They divided the single large
intestine and gave half to each infant.
</P>
<P>
   The most time-consuming part, said Hendren, was cutting and
reconnecting the ureters _ small tubes that carry urine from the
kidneys to the bladder _ which had been formed in the wrong
configuration, and solving the problems created by the absence of
one of the penises.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the surgical team needed to use a large expanse of
artificial skin to cover the extensive openings in the infants'
chests and abdomens resulting from their separation. The artificial
covering was removed as the infants' skin was stretched over the
wound, leaving only a long scar on each child.
</P>
<P>
   In a Solomonic decision, Hendren divided the sole penis
lengthways, giving one half to each boy: they'll have to undergo
considerable reconstructive surgery in the future, but the surgeon
believes they will have functioning male organs.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, Abdulla and Fatma Mohamed, learned that their twins
were conjoined when Fatma, 27, was four months pregnant. Siamese
twins are a rare event, occurring when a single fertilized egg
fails to completely divide to generate identical twins. Conjoined
twins can be attached to each other in many configurations.
Frequently, one or both twins die. But in some cases, they can be
freed from each other and live relatively normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through an interpreter, Fatma said she believed that
God would guide their future. And she said that some family members
told her _ wrongly _ that the twins would separate naturally while
still in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, initially
thought they could perform the surgery but later declined and
recommended the couple come to the United States. The US Embassy in
Washington steered them to Children's Hospital in Boston, the
couple said.
</P>
<P>
   Abdulla, who is a policeman, and Fatma said that the costs of
the surgery and transportation were being paid by the Abu Dhabi
government, and they are thankful to God and to Sheik Khalifa ben
Zayed Al Nahayan, the son of the president of the United Arab
Emirates. The son approved the couple's trip and authorized
government funds to pay all expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The successful outcome also came as good news to parents
belonging to Conjoined Twins International, a three-year-old
support group in Prescott, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a separation in which both twins lives is very rare,''
said Will Degeraty, whose daughter, Michelle Roderick, had Siamese
twins that were separated in California three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The support organization includes about 40 sets of twins and
their families, and the group is in touch with some individual
survivors, said Degeraty. In four cases, the twins remain
conjoined, and the other 36 have been separated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conjoined twins occur in about 4 of every 400,000 births, he
said. ``Of those four, three will be born dead. Of the remainder,
about 70 percent will die or go through life with serious medical
problems. The 30 percent that are left is what we are dealing with
today,'' said Degeraty.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter said that her twins, Shawna and Janelle, nearly
three years old, are doing fine. ``They know they were together _
we have pictures on the wall of when they were together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawna points to them and says, this is me and my sister when
were together,'' said Roderick. ``They have pride in the fact that
this is how they were.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of the stories are more grim, as in cases when one or
both twins dies. Degeraty said the support group knows of one woman
in her 20s who was the sole survivor of a pair of conjoined twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a big loss for her,'' said Degeraty. ``She picks a
rose every day and puts it on her bed _ that's her sister for
her.''

   WASHINGTON _ Despite all the talk about protecting people in
health maintenance organizations, most people in HMOs would derive
no tangible benefit from many of the consumer-protection standards
approved by the Senate this week as part of a comprehensive bill to
define patients' rights, lawyers and health policy experts said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's basic consumer protections would apply to 48 million
people in group health plans regulated exclusively by the federal
government. Few HMOs are in that category, according to data
published recently in the journal Health Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 48 million people, it appears, get their health care
through traditional fee-for-service arrangements or through loosely
organized forms of managed care, which are less restrictive than
the HMOs whose patient care decisions angered many consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators said repeatedly this week that they did not
want to usurp the states' authority to regulate insurance. In
general, they said, they wanted to set federal standards for health
plans that could not be regulated by the states _ ``self-insured''
health plans established by employers for their employees.
</P>
<P>
   The study in Health Affairs, by two economists at the Rand
Corp., Susan Marquis and Stephen H. Long, found that only 2 percent
of employers offer HMOs that would be covered by the standards of
the Senate bill. And only 9 percent of employees are in such HMOs,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Copeland, a research associate at the Employee Benefit
Research Institute, a nonpartisan organization, said Friday that
``only a small number of the 48 million people are in HMOs _ at
most 10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   In a ``self-insured'' health plan, the employer insures itself,
bearing the financial risk for its employees' medical costs and
often paying the claims out of the assets of the business. By
contrast, most HMOs bear the financial risk for their members. In
return for fixed monthly premiums, the HMOs promise to provide
whatever care is needed and covered under the insurance contract.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Timothy S. Jost of Ohio State University, the
co-author of a treatise on health law, said, ``Usually if a plan is
an HMO operation, it would be fully insured and therefore exempt''
from many standards in the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   An HMO is one type of managed care. In other forms of managed
care, patients may receive a discount if they use certain doctors
and hospitals, but they are not required to do so. Republicans said
that many people in these managed-care plans would gain protection
from the Senate-passed bill.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been fewer complaints about these plans because
they are less restrictive and generally do not require patients to
get permission to see a specialist or to go outside the network of
doctors recommended by the health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic senators often complained this week that the
Republican bill was a sham, but it was impossible to evaluate those
assertions until the full text of the legislation became available
Thursday night. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., offered
a substitute for the legislation considered in four days of debate,
and that substitute was the measure passed by a 53-47 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Several miscellaneous provisions of the bill, largely overlooked
in the debate Thursday night, drew sharp criticism Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One provision would kill an experimental program for HMOs in
Phoenix, Ariz. The demonstration project would require HMOs to
compete with one another and bid for the privilege of serving
Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., had joined HMOs in opposing the project.
But Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., Florida, said it was outrageous to
block a program that sought to use the free market to save money
for taxpayers and for the Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language to destroy this pilot project was buried in a
250-page bill, and nobody was given an opportunity to read it,''
Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Another provision of the bill would allow high-income people to
transfer money from an individual retirement account to a new type
of account known as a Roth IRA. Such rollovers are now allowed for
taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $100,000 a year or less.
The bill would increase that limit to $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the change would raise several billion dollars
of revenue in the next few years. Democrats said the proposal had
nothing to do with patients' rights, was a tax break for the
wealthy and would drain money from the Treasury over time.
</P>
<P>
   As lawmakers sorted through the legislation Friday, one thing
seemed clear. If the Senate bill becomes law, patients and
employers could be unsure of their rights and obligations because
they depend on the details and structure of the particular health
insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   Employees working side by side could thus have different rights
and remedies, depending on whether they were in an HMO, a
traditional insurance plan or some hybrid.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate Republican bill, all group health plans would
have to have procedures allowing individuals to obtain ``an
independent external review'' of decisions to deny coverage on the
ground that a particular service was medically unnecessary or
experimental.
</P>
<P>
   At least 18 states already mandate such appeal procedures,
according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Adrienne Hahn, legislative counsel for Consumers Union, said the
Senate bill would supersede the state laws, including some that
provide patients with more protection.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republican aides said they did not know if the bill would
pre-empt state laws that give patients more extensive appeal
rights. And the bill itself does not say.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The effort to define patients' rights takes Congress into a
legal swamp that surrounds a landmark 1974 law, the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act, known as ERISA. The law, which
governs health plans covering 125 million Americans, has been
described by the Supreme Court as ``an enormously complex and
detailed statute.''
</P>
<P>
   A major purpose of the law was to establish uniform federal
standards for health and pension plans, on the theory that
employers would be deterred from providing such benefits if they
had to comply with conflicting state laws.
</P>
<P>
   Many provisions of the Senate-passed bill are framed as
amendments to ERISA. But it is difficult to know for sure who would
be protected under provisions of the bill that would, for example,
guarantee access to emergency care, obstetricians and other medical
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these standards applies, in the words of the bill, to
``a group health plan (other than a fully insured group health
plan).''
</P>
<P>
   Other standards, which establish procedures for patients to
appeal a denial of coverage, apply to ``every employee benefit
plan.'' Still other standards apply to ``a group health plan'' or
an insurance company that offers coverage in connection with a
group health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Weinhaus, a St. Louis lawyer who often represents
patients, said these provisions of the bill were ``an invitation to
mischief.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one really knows, with any precision, what is meant by the
terms `self-insured' and `fully insured,''' Weinhaus said.
Employers and insurers often share the risk of paying for
catastrophic medical expenses, he added.
</P>
<P>
   One of the stronger provisions in the Senate bill would require
all health plans to pay for overnight hospital stays after breast
cancer treatments, including mastectomy, if a woman and her doctor
agreed that such a stay was ``medically necessary and
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other provisions, this one would cover anyone with
private health insurance.

IRAN DISPLAYS CONFLICTING VIEWS OF U.S. INFLUENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHERAN, Iran _ At Friday Prayers here at noon, America was
presented as the all-powerful hidden hand behind the worst civil
unrest in Iran's 20 years of revolutionary history.
</P>
<P>
   In a docudrama on Iranian television a few hours later that
included clips of Jimmy Carter and Sam Donaldson, America was
presented as an inept, pagan military giant that could not even
rescue its own hostages in 1980 because God was on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   The two vastly different characterizations underscore the
contradictions in the official Iranian view of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the United States is blamed as the evil
mastermind behind every misfortune _ the recent political unrest,
the crippled economy, the dramatic fall of Iran's currency and the
cultural pollution of the youth. On the other, the United States is
scorned as the helpless superpower that has tried over the years to
destroy the Islamic republic but has failed miserably.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is a third view, espoused by the reformist newspapers
that back President Mohammad Khatami, that Iran can no longer play
the role of victim and has to solve its own problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do we accuse the foreign enemy, instead of acknowledging
the truth and finding our own weakness?'' an editorial in the
Khordad newspaper asked about the violent street demonstrations of
the last week. ``Do we have a foreign enemy that is so strong that
it managed to penetrate and riot even in the most central streets
of Tehran?''
</P>
<P>
   But that was not the view expressed at Tehran University, the
country's biggest official platform. There, the government sent
Hassan Taheri Khoramabadi, the most junior of the four rotating
speakers at Friday Prayers, to address the tens of thousands of
worshipers.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. meddling was part of a plot to destroy Iran's economy, the
cleric said. ``America wants to prove to the European and our
neighboring countries and the Middle Eastern countries that there
is no stability in Iran, that there's anarchy here,'' he said.
``That way the others would not have relations and do business with
Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Death to America!'' the crowd chanted.
</P>
<P>
   Khoramabadi said nothing less than the demise of the revolution
was the goal of the American-backed protesters. ``It is the
revolution that they have taken aim at,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death to America!'' the crowd chanted again.
</P>
<P>
   He asked the country's top leaders to define ``a red line for
the revolution'' that no one would be allowed to cross.
``Differences in a family can be tolerated, but there have to be
unbreakable limits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death to America!'' the crowd chanted again.
</P>
<P>
   So it went all through the sermon.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen months ago at the same pavilion on the first
anniversary of his election, Khatami had a quite different message,
a call to end the clergy's tight hold on power. He silenced a group
of students when they uttered the familiar, ``Death to America!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer to talk about life, not death,'' he said, to cheering
and clapping, considered an un-Islamic and Western affectation.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy did not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regime is like a shop that is selling this slogan,'' said
a political science professor at Tehran University who a few days
ago was willing to speak on the record but is no longer. ``If they
lose this slogan, they have nothing left to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   On the docudrama Friday afternoon, one of the most popular
viewing times of the week, a different sort of anti-Americanism was
on display, ``Sandstorm,'' an officially produced film about the
failed military raid by the United States to free American hostages
in April 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The use of television footage from the crisis lent an
authenticity to the film. It showed Carter in his signature
cardigan sweater in the Oval Office, consulting with Vice President
Walter Mondale and other top aides; Donaldson, with long sideburns,
reporting the seizure of the U.S. Embassy on ABC News on Nov. 4,
1979, and an English-speaking hostage taker who interviewed blacks
and women among the hostages. The hostages were released ``on
humanitarian grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The rescue mission was a horrific combination of bad luck and
poor planning. The plan was to raid the embassy from a staging area
deep in the Iranian desert. The mission was called off after three
of the eight helicopters involved had been put out of action by
technical problems. In the evacuation, a helicopter collided with a
C-130 transport plane. Eight Americans died. The evacuating
Americans left behind a battlefield scene of burned and abandoned
equipment, and the bodies of their comrades.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute film portrays the Americans as ruthless,
obscenity-spouting veterans of Vietnam eager to free the hostages _
and perhaps restore the monarchy in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``By tomorrow, we will have Iran in our hands,'' the commander
said in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me, old soldier, do you mean we're going to have a
military coup?'' asked the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you think we're going with no plan and no invitation into
the heart of the enemy?'' the commander replied.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the film was accurate. It portrayed a team of U.S. spies
posing as journalists as they watched the embassy from a hotel
across the street.
</P>
<P>
   But like any docudrama, distortions abounded. The main
Persian-speaking spy was a Zionist, who wears a yarmulke. When an
American commando tried to pray, his commander did not let him
finish.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the film showed actual film of the rescuers' crash
site and the eight bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who stopped Carter's helicopters?'' a male voice asked at the
film's end, a quote from the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the
father of Iran's revolution. ``We stopped it. The sands stopped it.
They were God's messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   In the reformist newspapers, a different sort of ``dialogue'' is
being conducted.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown against the protesters and the pledge by the
authorities to use all necessary means to prevent more trouble may
have stilled the students, at least for the moment. But the move
has emboldened commentators in several newspapers, who are writing
in ways that they would not have dared even a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers have become a voice of the country's conscience,
demanding that Iran look at home, not abroad, for the reasons
behind the unrest.
</P>
<P>
   One argument is that the years of restrictions have prompted the
youth of Iran to rebel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our kids are at school, they only hear things like, `Do
not do this, do not do that,''' Shahla Ezazi, a sociologist, wrote
on Thursday in Neshat. ``Instead of learning to become independent
citizens capable of living in society, they react this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Other commentators dared to compare the protesters to the
revolutionaries in 1979. In an article on Thursday in Khordad, ``I
Went to Prison for Freedom,'' a commentator, Minoo Badi, wrote that
at Tehran University ``I saw boys and girls who were shouting just
like their parents did, the same 21-year-old faces, as though
history were repeating itself.''

BOSTON DOCTOR SUCCESSFULY SEPARATES JOINED TWINS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- When they first arrived at Children's Hospital in
March, identical twins Hassan and Hussein Mohamed were a cranky,
crying pair of infants, said Dr. Hardy Hendren, the legendary
pediatric surgeon who treated them.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all,'' noted Hendren recently, ``they were in each
others' face all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   They had no choice. The infants, born last December, were joined
front-to-front from their chests to their genital areas. Only by
arching their backs could they gain some individual space. Inside
their bonded bodies, their abdominal tissues were fused, their
urinary tracts were tangled, and they had but one penis between
them.
</P>
<P>
   But in late June, the boys lay apparently content in individual
carriers being readied for the trip to their home in Abu Dhabi.
They now seemed much like any other six-month-olds: happy and
mellow, with shining eyes and cheerful gurgles.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan and Hussein were separated on April 5 in a complex,
25-hour operation led by Hendren, known for his skillful repairs of
some of the most severe birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic case wasn't disclosed until Friday because the
parents agreed to release the story first to media in Abu Dhabi
upon their return.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hendren who performed the first separation of Siamese
twins in Boston 30 years ago at Massachusetts General Hospital.
Those twins, Maureen Ann and Marie Elizabeth Kobierski of Danvers,
Mass., were joined in a similar fashion as Hassan and Hussein. The
Kobierskis are still living in the Danvers area.
</P>
<P>
   The name Siamese twins comes from the most famous of
``conjoined'' male twins, Chang and Eng, born in Siam of Chinese
parents in 1811. They became exhibits in P.T. Barnum's circus for
many years; although never separated, they married and fathered a
total of 22 children. They died within 2 hours of each other in
1874.
</P>
<P>
   Separating conjoined twins remains a rare procedure. Hendren, a
former World War II Navy fighter pilot, has now separated 15 pairs
in his long career. He noted that his main operating room nurse at
the time of the Kobierskis' operation, Dorothy Estes, was on hand
to assist him in the surgery on Hassan and Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Separating Siamese twins is always a difficult and risky
undertaking. The operation to free Hassan and Hussein from each
other was especially complex because the urinary and reproductive
organs were so abnormally situated.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are `thinking' cases,'' said Hendren, who at age 73 is
still renowned for his stamina and creative problem-solving in
treating the most devastating birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to see what you have to work with, and think about
what you're going to do. It's improvisation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The team led by Hendren included the chief surgical resident,
Dr. Ann Fischer, and the chief urological resident, Dr. John Park.
</P>
<P>
   The gruelling operation began at 7:30 a.m. April 5 and didn't
conclude until 8:30 a.m. the following day. ``You can't stop until
you get all the parts figured out,'' said Hendren, who said from
the surgeons' point of view it was like ``doing two liver
transplants back to back.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the twins' hearts were not joined. Still, Hendren
and his team had to separate the two livers and two stomachs as
well as two small intestines. They divided the single large
intestine and gave half to each infant.
</P>
<P>
   The most time-consuming part, said Hendren, was cutting and
reconnecting the ureters _ small tubes that carry urine from the
kidneys to the bladder _ which had been formed in the wrong
configuration, and solving the problems created by the absence of
one of the penises.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the surgical team needed to use a large expanse of
artificial skin to cover the extensive openings in the infants'
chests and abdomens resulting from their separation. The artificial
covering was removed as the infants' skin was stretched over the
wound, leaving only a long scar on each child.
</P>
<P>
   In a Solomonic decision, Hendren divided the sole penis
lengthways, giving one half to each boy: they'll have to undergo
considerable reconstructive surgery in the future, but the surgeon
believes they will have functioning male organs.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, Abdulla and Fatma Mohamed, learned that their twins
were conjoined when Fatma, 27, was four months pregnant. Siamese
twins are a rare event, occurring when a single fertilized egg
fails to completely divide to generate identical twins. Conjoined
twins can be attached to each other in many configurations.
Frequently, one or both twins die. But in some cases, they can be
freed from each other and live relatively normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through an interpreter, Fatma said she believed that
God would guide their future. And she said that some family members
told her _ wrongly _ that the twins would separate naturally while
still in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, initially
thought they could perform the surgery but later declined and
recommended the couple come to the United States. The US Embassy in
Washington steered them to Children's Hospital in Boston, the
couple said.
</P>
<P>
   Abdulla, who is a policeman, and Fatma said that the costs of
the surgery and transportation were being paid by the Abu Dhabi
government, and they are thankful to God and to Sheik Khalifa ben
Zayed Al Nahayan, the son of the president of the United Arab
Emirates. The son approved the couple's trip and authorized
government funds to pay all expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The successful outcome also came as good news to parents
belonging to Conjoined Twins International, a three-year-old
support group in Prescott, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a separation in which both twins lives is very rare,''
said Will Degeraty, whose daughter, Michelle Roderick, had Siamese
twins that were separated in California three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The support organization includes about 40 sets of twins and
their families, and the group is in touch with some individual
survivors, said Degeraty. In four cases, the twins remain
conjoined, and the other 36 have been separated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conjoined twins occur in about 4 of every 400,000 births, he
said. ``Of those four, three will be born dead. Of the remainder,
about 70 percent will die or go through life with serious medical
problems. The 30 percent that are left is what we are dealing with
today,'' said Degeraty.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter said that her twins, Shawna and Janelle, nearly
three years old, are doing fine. ``They know they were together _
we have pictures on the wall of when they were together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawna points to them and says, this is me and my sister when
were together,'' said Roderick. ``They have pride in the fact that
this is how they were.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of the stories are more grim, as in cases when one or
both twins dies. Degeraty said the support group knows of one woman
in her 20s who was the sole survivor of a pair of conjoined twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a big loss for her,'' said Degeraty. ``She picks a
rose every day and puts it on her bed _ that's her sister for
her.''

NEW REVELATION UPS CONCERN OVER USE OF PBS DONOR LISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A public television station in California admitted
Friday it exchanged donor lists with not only the Democratic
National Committee but also Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer,
heightening concern on Capitol Hill over a pattern of list-swapping
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Republicans in Congress increased their calls
for a formal investigative hearing, and Representative W.J.
``Billy'' Tauzin, chairman of the subcommittee that oversees
funding for public broadcasting, expanded his inquiry into
list-swapping to include stations in Los Angeles, Chicago and New
York.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH-TV, the Boston public television channel, and two other
stations admitted to list-swapping with political parties earlier
in the week. Only WNET in New York said its swapping included
Republican groups as well as Democratic ones.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican, said the
latest disclosure that KQED-TV in San Francisco worked directly
with a politician _ swapping donor names with Boxer's reelection
campaign twice in 1997 _ was the most troubling so far. Spokesman
Ken Johnson called it the equivalent of ``putting a billboard on
your head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are beginning to hear disturbing reports that these lists
are being brokered to individual politicians around the country,''
he said. ``This may shake the foundations of donor-swapping
practices nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Boxer declined to comment. David Shaw, a
spokesman for KQED, said Friday's discovery of list-swapping with
the Boxer campaign, along with two exchanges of donor names with
the Democratic National Committee in 1996, prompted a review of
station policy. KQED officials immediately announced a tightening
of their rules and will no longer allow the station's list broker
to swap names with any political party or advocacy group, Shaw
said.
</P>
<P>
   KQED and several other stations also swapped donor names with
liberal-leaning advocacy groups, according to a ``list card,'' the
profile sheet used by list brokers to promote an organization's
demographics. KQED, for example, has swapped lists with the
American Civil Liberties Union. WETA-TV in Washington, in addition
to swapping lists with the Democrats, has also shared information
with Handgun Control Inc. and Planned Parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of trading donor lists between public stations and
political parties was thrown into the national spotlight on
Tuesday, when news that WGBH had swapped lists with the DNC was
circulated at a House Commerce subcommittee meeting. Republican
members immediately blocked plans to debate a $525 million funding
increase for the national public broadcasting system. Now, that
funding might be be sharply reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the umbrella
organization that receives federal funding and distributes it to
member stations across the country, has asked its inspector general
to investigate the list-swapping.
</P>
<P>
   Several House Republicans said they also want the Internal
Revenue Service to examine whether the stations violated federal
tax laws, which prohibit tax-exempt groups from working exclusively
with one political party and not the other.
</P>
<P>
   The full extent of the list-swapping continued to unfold as the
House subcommittee prepares to hold a hearing Tuesday to question
various officials, including Robert Coonrod, president of the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting. House Republicans had
initially planned to call WGBH officials as the first witnesses.
After it became clear that at least one station had exchanged lists
with Republican groups, the panel changed plans and wants to
question the whole system and not just one station.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday night, WGBH officials were not expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, the top
Democrat on the subcommittee, said he told Tauzin of the bipartisan
nature of the controversy. With both parties involved, Markey said,
there was a greater likelihood the subcommittee could reconsider
the funding increase for public broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might be able to return to the status quo,'' Markey said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But that seemed unlikely Friday night, as Republicans continued
to focus on the majority of list-swapping incidents that involved
Democrats. The news that Boxer's Senate campaign committee was
among the organizations that used KQED's donor list only fueled the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DNC is a political organization trying to elect Democrats,
and Barbara Boxer is one Democrat trying to elect a Democrat,''
said Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Collins.
``What is apparent is that the Democratic Party regards public
broadcasting as a branch office, as a wholly owned subsidiary.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for WBUR, a public radio station in
Boston, said the station has followed its longstanding policy of
not sharing its donor lists with any organizations. The Republican
National Committee and the Massachusetts Republican Party also said
they had not swapped lists with any public broadcasting stations.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a spokeswoman for WGBH said the station had
dismissed its list broker, the outside manager who oversaw the
trading of some 32,000 donor names with the DNC between 1993 and
February 1999. The spokeswoman would not identify the firm and
declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Alan D. Solomont, the former DNC finance chairman and a major
contributor to the Democratic Party as well as a member of the WGBH
board, said that compared with most campaign fund-raisers, ``GBH is
a prude.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomont _ whose wife, Susan Lewis, worked at WGBH for 15 years
and was last employed there full-time as its director of
development _ said if there had been any desire by WGBH to link
itself with the Democratic Party, station officials would have
approached him first. Despite their ties to both WGBH and the
Democratic Party, both Solomont and his wife said in interviews
this week that they never saw any partisan activity on the part of
the public station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has absolutely nothing to do with any political
collusion,'' Solomont said. ``Direct mail is a business unto
itself. People trade lists all the time. There was a prohibition
against trading lists with a political organization at 'GBH and it
shouldn't have been done, but it was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, people will try to now exploit this for
political reasons when there's really nothing of that nature here.
And a very, very valuable asset _ public broadcasting _ will be
damaged as a result.''

NEW REVELATION UPS CONCERN OVER USE OF PBS DONOR LISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A public television station in California admitted
Friday it exchanged donor lists with not only the Democratic
National Committee but also Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer,
heightening concern on Capitol Hill over a pattern of list-swapping
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Republicans in Congress increased their calls
for a formal investigative hearing, and Representative W.J.
``Billy'' Tauzin, chairman of the subcommittee that oversees
funding for public broadcasting, expanded his inquiry into
list-swapping to include stations in Los Angeles, Chicago and New
York.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH-TV, the Boston public television channel, and two other
stations admitted to list-swapping with political parties earlier
in the week. Only WNET in New York said its swapping included
Republican groups as well as Democratic ones.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican, said the
latest disclosure that KQED-TV in San Francisco worked directly
with a politician _ swapping donor names with Boxer's reelection
campaign twice in 1997 _ was the most troubling so far. Spokesman
Ken Johnson called it the equivalent of ``putting a billboard on
your head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are beginning to hear disturbing reports that these lists
are being brokered to individual politicians around the country,''
he said. ``This may shake the foundations of donor-swapping
practices nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Boxer declined to comment. David Shaw, a
spokesman for KQED, said Friday's discovery of list-swapping with
the Boxer campaign, along with two exchanges of donor names with
the Democratic National Committee in 1996, prompted a review of
station policy. KQED officials immediately announced a tightening
of their rules and will no longer allow the station's list broker
to swap names with any political party or advocacy group, Shaw
said.
</P>
<P>
   KQED and several other stations also swapped donor names with
liberal-leaning advocacy groups, according to a ``list card,'' the
profile sheet used by list brokers to promote an organization's
demographics. KQED, for example, has swapped lists with the
American Civil Liberties Union. WETA-TV in Washington, in addition
to swapping lists with the Democrats, has also shared information
with Handgun Control Inc. and Planned Parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of trading donor lists between public stations and
political parties was thrown into the national spotlight on
Tuesday, when news that WGBH had swapped lists with the DNC was
circulated at a House Commerce subcommittee meeting. Republican
members immediately blocked plans to debate a $525 million funding
increase for the national public broadcasting system. Now, that
funding might be be sharply reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the umbrella
organization that receives federal funding and distributes it to
member stations across the country, has asked its inspector general
to investigate the list-swapping.
</P>
<P>
   Several House Republicans said they also want the Internal
Revenue Service to examine whether the stations violated federal
tax laws, which prohibit tax-exempt groups from working exclusively
with one political party and not the other.
</P>
<P>
   The full extent of the list-swapping continued to unfold as the
House subcommittee prepares to hold a hearing Tuesday to question
various officials, including Robert Coonrod, president of the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting. House Republicans had
initially planned to call WGBH officials as the first witnesses.
After it became clear that at least one station had exchanged lists
with Republican groups, the panel changed plans and wants to
question the whole system and not just one station.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday night, WGBH officials were not expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, the top
Democrat on the subcommittee, said he told Tauzin of the bipartisan

there was a greater likelihood the subcommittee could reconsider
the funding increase for public broadcasting.

RAUL SALINAS' SENTENCE IN MEXICO MURDER IS CUT TO 27{ YEARS
</HEADLINE>
   (ko) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ An appeals court Friday reduced the murder
sentence against Raul Salinas de Gortari, the brother of the former
president, by nearly half, to 27{ years, from 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   That bit of relatively good news for Salinas, who was convicted
on Jan. 21, came with another pleasant surprise. The highest court
in Switzerland announced Friday that it had overturned the
confiscation of more than $90 million of his money, a rebuke to
Swiss Attorney General Carla del Ponte.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss court found that Mrs. del Ponte had no authority to
seize the money on the supposition that it included proceeds from
drug trafficking. But the ruling was based on the intricacies of
Swiss law and did not absolve Salinas of the money-laundering
charges.
</P>
<P>
   His money in Switzerland remains frozen, and local authorities
there can still prosecute him, even though the attorney general
cannot.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mexican ruling on his sentence, the appeals court in
Toluca, about 50 miles west of Mexico City, said it had halved
Salinas' sentence, which had been the maximum under Mexican law,
because the prosecution had failed to show any motive for him to
have committed the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mexican law, the lack of a motive is not a basis for
acquittal in a homicide case but may, as in this one, lessen the
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas was convicted in the 1994 assassination of Jose
Francisco Ruiz Massieu, a prominent politician who had once been
his brother-in-law. The appeals judge found that since Salinas had
been convicted as the instigator and not the gunman, he should not
be given the maximum sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court also doubted the credibility of a witness on
whom the prosecution relied heavily, Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez.
Rodriguez was convicted of murder for hiring the gunman. His family
received payments of about $500,000 from prosecutors just before he
changed his testimony to implicate Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas' murder conviction marked a historic break with a
tradition in Mexico of impunity for the rich and politically
powerful. But the case raised new doubts about Mexican justice,
because it relied heavily on witnesses who had been paid by
prosecutors or had been caught in clumsy attempts to frame Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Luengo Creel, Salinas' defense lawyer, visited him
Friday morning and emerged from prison to say Salinas had once
again insisted that he was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never came up with a motive for him to do it,'' Luengo
said Friday. ``He had nothing to do with that crime.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there would be a further appeal, which would eventually
end up in the Supreme Court. But he said that first he had to
restudy the 131,164-page record of the original case and the 7,819
pages of the appellate decision.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that the final appeal might not be filed under
2001, when President Ernesto Zedillo, who ordered the prosecution
to go forward, leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Luengo was especially pleased about the Swiss ruling that any
money-laundering investigation was a matter for cantonal
authorities and not federal ones like Mrs. del Ponte.
</P>
<P>
   The court barred Mrs. del Ponte from any further investigation
in the case and ordered her to pay $15,000 to Salinas' lawyers and
$3,000 in fees to the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``She acted as though we were living in the age of the
Inquisition,'' Luengo said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. del Ponte carried out her investigation in secret, giving
Salinas no opportunity to present a defense. She traveled several
times to the United States to interview jailed drug dealers who
said they knew of Salinas' ties to traffickers, finding 80
witnesses who said Salinas had met with traffickers and introduced
them to other Mexican politicians.
</P>
<P>
   But in the formal complaint that Mrs. del Ponte presented in the
proceeding in which she seized Salinas' money, most of the
witnesses were not identified by name.

BILL WOULD EXPAND HUNT FOR RIGHTS VIOLATORS IN US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A bill introduced by Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a
Vermont Democrat, would expand the role of the US Justice
Department's anti-Nazi unit to hunt down other alleged war
criminals whose presence in the United States was documented in a
three-part Globe investigation last May.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Special Investigations, which was created in 1979,
is authorized to pursue only Nazi war criminals who slipped into
the United States after World War II. But Leahy said the Globe's
findings demonstrated the need to expand the unit's
responsibilities to cover human rights offenders from countries
such as Haiti, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just do not want the United States to be seen as a safe
haven for these war criminals,'' Leahy said in an interview. ``In
fact, I want the United States to be as inhospitable a land as
they'll face anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Leahy, the leading Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee,
said he expected the committee to hold hearings on the bill later
this year. No hearings have been scheduled, but officials said they
are hopeful the committee could take up the issue in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy's pursuit of the bill stems in part from a Globe story
reporting that a 39-year-old Bosnian refugee living outside of
Burlington, Vt., is a former member of a notorious Bosnian Serb
paramilitary unit that has been accused of atrocities in the former
Yugoslavia. Zijad Music has denied his involvement with the group,
known as El Manijakos. He is under investigation by the Immigration
and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe also reported that a broad range of other immigrants,
including Haitians, Somalis and Salvadorans, have been granted
residency in the United States despite substantial evidence of
their involvement in human rights crimes, including torture. In
some cases, the alleged war criminals entered the United States
with the knowledge and assistance of US officals.
</P>
<P>
   The INS responded to the Globe investigation by tightening the
screening procedures for some 20,000 refugees admitted to the US
during the recent crisis in Kosovo. But INS officials contend that
they lacked sufficient resources to pursue human rights criminals
in the US and are hampered by immigration laws that make it
difficult to deport them once they are discovered.
</P>
<P>
   As introduced by Leahy, the Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act
would:
</P>
<P>
   -- Allow US immigration officials to deny entry and deport all
``aliens who have engaged in acts of torture abroad.'' The
Immigration and Nationality Act is currently limited to
participants in Nazi persecutions and aliens who have engaged in
genocide.
</P>
<P>
   -- Greatly expand the role of OSI to investigate, deport,
prosecute and revoke the citizenship of any immigrant who
participated in torture abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979, OSI has been regarded by its supporters as the most
effective anti-Nazi unit in the world. Information gathered by the
unit has helped strip 61 Nazi persecutors of their US citizenship,
has led to the deportation of 49 others and denial of entry to
another 150 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their mandate is limited,'' said Leahy. ``I don't want to
detract from that. But there are new Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said the bill would provide for additional funding for OSI
to meet its new responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about the future of OSI has increased in recent
years as the remaining Nazi collaborators have continued to age.
The unit is currently handling some 20 cases, but OSI officials
acknowledge that at some point the unit will become obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights monitors have suggested expanding OSI's role to
address the growing problem of alleged human rights criminals who
have used the United States as safe haven from more recent global
conflicts. The scope of the problem is unclear. The Center for
Justice and Accountability, a San Francisco group funded by Amnesty
International, has compiled information on dozens of cases and
believes the numbers may be in the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   INS official believe the problem is less serious, but is
growing.

SYMPATHIZERS PROTEST RIGHTS CRACKDOWN IN IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reacting to the crackdown on pro-democracy
supporters in Iran, thousands of Iranian-Americans demonstrated
near the Capitol Friday to decry the Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
   The rally followed a weeklong wave of protests against Islamic
rule in Iran, where scores of students were arrested in a bloody
clash with government police.
</P>
<P>
   Waving Iranian flags and singing Iran's national anthem,
protesters called for the overthrow of President Mohammad Khatami,
the moderate Iranian leader who denounced the student protests.
Khatami, elected two years ago in a landslide, had been expected to
push for change in his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all here in support of democracy,'' said Farzad Ghorbi,
37, of Boston. ``I owe it to my family. I owe it to my people. I
owe it to all the people in Iran who suffer everyday in the name of
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   At the rally, several members of Congress urged the Clinton
administration to support Mujahedeen Khalq, the resistance group
that the State Department has labeled a terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The State Department and the adminstration would like us to
believe this fairy tale,'' said Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,
a Florida Republican. ``But siding with the tyrants who are
terrorizing the people of Iran will go absolutely nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   While both Iranian leaders and the Clinton administration call
the Mujahedeen terrorists, Ros-Lehtinen said the majority of
Congress supports the resistance group.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, told the
crowd he believed democracy will eventually win in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people want to stop this dictatorship in Iran and they
will succeed,'' he said. ``We stand with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mina Entezari, 37, who came from Phoenix just to attend the
demonstration, said, ``The events of last week is proof that we
can't work with Khatami. He has shown his true self to us and we
know that he does not stand for what we stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanya Kianfard, 17, of Atlanta summed up the protest: ``All we
are doing is fighting for freedom _ the one thing we don't have in
Iran. We want to free our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The clash between the Islamic fundamentalists and pro-democratic
students began July 8 after the shutdown of a liberal newspaper in
Tehran sparked a massive student protest. Security forces stormed
dormitories at Tehran University, throwing students out of windows.
As many as eight students died.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations spurred a counterprotest by supporters of
Islamic rule, who marched in the streets of Tehran on Wednesday to
back Khatami and Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's protest organizers criticized the US government for its
inaction following the student demonstrations in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the leaders in this country blind?'' said Soona Samsami,
of the Paris-based National Council for Resistance of Iran, the
group that oversees the Mujahedeen and the National Liberation
Army. ``How many years does this have to go on? How many people
have to die, be hanged in public and persecuted for the leaders
here to pay attention to what is happening in Iran?''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, who have been trying to establish
dialogue with Khatami with little success, said they were concerned
about any appearance of US interference in Iran.

   But What if It Turns Out It Only Runs on Windows? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates' golden touch reaches well beyond his personal
wealth, which edged up by $6 billion-plus last week to more than
$100 billion. It was also a good week for the stray cats and dogs
in Redmond, Ore., who may soon be sleeping more comfortably thanks
to the allure of a car Gates once owned.
</P>
<P>
   The burgundy Lexus LS400 sedan, a 1990 model driven 82,000
miles, was auctioned over the Web site of Carscene.com, with the
proceeds to benefit the Humane Society of Redmond, a fast-growing
town of 12,000 in central Oregon that is not to be confused with
the similarly named Washington State hometown of a certain software
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The car, making its second appearance in a charity auction since
Gates gave it up in 1995, was donated by Philip and Jo Weigand of
Powell Butte, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Weigand bought the car a year and a half ago for $18,000 at a
society benefit in Portland, Ore., for Pacific Crest Outward Bound.
This time, a bidder in Pennsylvania made the top offer of $38,000.
Weigand said he would donate the proceeds, minus some expenses, to
the humane society, where his wife works in the thrift shop on
Mondays. The group, which is facing a potential rent increase to
$20,000 a year, from a nominal $1, hopes to relocate its shelter.
</P>
<P>
   So what does one get in a nine-year-old $38,000 car? Tan leather
seats, compact disk changer, built-in phone and antenna, original
Washington plates (696 CVV), additional Oregon tags (SOFTWR) and a
letter from the world's richest man attesting to his use of the car
from 1990 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokeswoman would not say what Gates currently
drives, or whether he has a chauffeur, because of security
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe you have your own '90 LS400? The Kelley Blue Book sets
the trade-in value at $11,725 and the retail price at $18,030.
Gates premium not included.

   James G. Cobb &QL;

</P>
<P>
   He Just Keeps On Drilling &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John R. Stanley, whose oil-patch booms and busts echo more
loudly than almost anyone else's, is at it again. After a third
corporate bankruptcy filing in 20 years, he has lined up his
creditors behind a reorganization plan submitted on Friday that
would let him drill for natural gas once more. But they took his
biggest toy away.
</P>
<P>
   In April, his Trans Texas Gas Corp. filed for bankruptcy
protection under Chapter 11 as low energy prices kept it from
paying its bills. But now prices are bouncing back.
</P>
<P>
   As tenacious as Stanley, 60 and 6 feet 2 inches tall, may be, he
has lost control of a thousand-acre refinery in Norco, La., that he
had spent $2 billion improving. The largest addition to the
nation's refining capacity in two decades, it confronted cost
overruns. To complete the project, he had to give his creditors a
70 percent share, keeping the rest. Stanley, for whom the refinery
was a passion, has been reduced to a largely passive role as one of
five directors of the company that owns it.
</P>
<P>
   Agis Salpukas &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just Don't Expect a Coupon &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No, he wouldn't be so crass as to change his Web site's address
to Buydiana.com. But anyone wanting electronic suggestions on
buying the right clothing, jewelry and gifts can now rely on the
same man Princess Diana used as her personal shopping companion.
Roberto Devorik, the London retailing and fashion consultant (to
clients like Versace, Christian LaCroix, Missoni and Oscar de la
Renta) and man about town, has just joined Bestselections.com, the
New York-based Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   The Bestselections Web site modestly claims to sell ``only the
best of everything from around the whole world.'' As president of
the international division, Devorik will pick stores and
merchandise to feature on a site that already offers a $180 beaded
bikini and a $77,000 emerald and diamond ring.
</P>
<P>
   In turning his free advice into a source of income, Devorik said
in a telephone interview (using the royal pronoun), ``We're not
interested in just the priciest, but the best.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Princess Diana, he has regularly shopped for
Princess Michael of Kent, Jacqueline Bisset and Gordon Campbell
Gray, owner of the One Aldwych Hotel in the City of London.
</P>
<P>
   Devorik, 50, a native of Buenos Aires, grew up making shopping
trips with his mother to New York as casually as most folks would
go to the local mall. He plans to move within a month, with hopes
of buying a town house on Manhattan's Sutton Place for himself and
his Jack Russell terrier. No need to ask him what's the best breed
of dog.

ECONOMIST LAUREATE, QUILL IN HAND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SYLVIA NASAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ At 90, John Kenneth Galbraith has just
published his 34th book, ``Name-Dropping,'' (Houghton Mifflin, $26)
a memoir featuring FDR and Eleanor, Jack and Jackie, Adlai and LBJ.
He has been speaking to packed auditoriums, and now he is ready to
hop on a plane to London, where he will be giving a speech on ``The
Unfinished Business of the Century.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is already hard at work on Book No. 35. ``I get uneasy
unless I've spent part of every day writing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Economics may have become a science, but for the better part of
this century, Galbraith has shrewdly insisted on treating it as a
branch of belles lettres. In several books over the last couple of
decades, Galbraith, who was perhaps the only economist at Truman
Capote's 1966 Black and White Ball, has been mining a rich vein of
history: his own.
</P>
<P>
   He writes from memory _ ``I never kept a diary,'' he says. His
beginnings belie his born-to-the-manor manner and the grand
Victorian, a few hundred yards from Harvard Square, where he lives.
</P>
<P>
   He describes himself as a southern Ontario farm boy who to this
day never wakes up without a feeling of satisfaction at having
escaped ``hard, tedious, boring toil.'' Interestingly, it was his
grasp of the realities of that life that gave him entree, back when
farm politics dominated American politics, into Washington and
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   His memories are less of his long academic career than of his
glamorous political assignments. During the Depression, he was
briefly a junior speech writer for President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
An early sojourn at Cambridge University made him a disciple of the
British economist John Maynard Keynes, of whom he says, ``I
discovered that his advice was always right, but politically
disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
   An initial stint at Harvard in the '30s proved less than a
triumph. When he left briefly to visit Princeton, he got a telegram
from his dean saying, ``Accept any available offer!'' He did take
one, but the exile at Princeton _ ``still back in the
pre-Keynesian, classical era,'' he said _ was mercifully brief,
thanks to the outbreak of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Hired by the Department of Agriculture, he was ultimately
charged with keeping a lid on all prices. He recalls his experience
as price czar as the highlight of his career. ``In terms of
authority and power,'' he said with a grin, ``life has been
downhill ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the war ended, President Harry S. Truman sent
Galbraith to Germany to interrogate Albert Speer, Hitler's economic
minister. In contrast to other Hitler henchmen, notorious drug
addicts and drunks, Speer proved to be a suave master of spin, in
command of snappy American idiom and, in Galbraith's eyes, the only
Nazi who made the enemy ``worth the wartime effort and sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon back at Harvard, Galbraith wrote speeches and served as an
economics tutor to every liberal democratic presidential candidate
from Adlai Stevenson and John F. Kennedy to George McGovern. At one
point, Galbraith thought he might like to become a senator from
Massachusetts, though the idea didn't go far.
</P>
<P>
   His imposing height of 6 feet, 8 inches was always an advantage,
he acknowledges. So was the colossal self-assurance. When he once
complained to President Kennedy that he didn't see why The New York
Times had to call him arrogant, Kennedy replied: ``I don't know why
not, Ken. Everyone else does.''
</P>
<P>
   He came by his success as an author after relentless practice
and some false starts. When one of his first efforts, blaming the
rise of monopolies for the Depression, was still at the printing
press, he wanted to pull it back. As soon as he read Keynes, he
said, ``I decided the book was wrong, but it was too late.'' Later,
he quietly dropped it from his list of publications.
</P>
<P>
   It was ever upward from there, with classics of social criticism
like ``The Affluent Society'' (1958) and ``The New Industrial
State'' (1967). His biggest hit was ``The Triumph'' a novel of
State Department intrigue published in 1968 and optioned four times
by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Time hasn't mellowed him much. Galbraith's new book, like so
many of his old ones, pokes at fellow economists and what he sees
as their erroneous but convenient beliefs. He plans to call it
``The Economics of Innocent Fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he didn't think the 1990s were a lot like the
golden '60s, he sat up very straight. `There is no comparison!'' he
nearly shouted, launching into a riff on the dangers of unchecked
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a much greater speculative bulge than in the '60s,''
he said. ``Prices are going up, so people buy. That justifies the
expectation, so they buy more. It's a classic bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   He refrains from predicting how the current economic boom will
end, explaining: ``All my wrong predictions will always be
remembered. My right ones not.''

GIULIANI SPARS WITH CALLER TO HIS RADIO SHOW
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The caller to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's weekly radio
show Friday morning identified herself as Margarita from the Bronx,
the mayor's aides said, and told the station workers who screen his
calls that she wanted to talk about Con Edison, the utility that
the city is suing over a blackout in northern Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The caller, in fact, was Margarita Rosario, and while she is
from the Bronx, what she wanted to talk about was her son Anthony,
an 18-year-old robbery suspect who was shot dead by two police
detectives in January 1995. Her nephew, Hilton Vega, 21, was also a
suspect and was also shot dead.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief exchange of pleasantries, Mrs. Rosario identified
herself and what followed was a heated exchange in which Giuliani
lectured Mrs. Rosario and, by extension, other parents and society
in general about taking responsibility for raising children
properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure you remember me,'' Mrs. Rosario began.
</P>
<P>
   There was no doubt; Mrs. Rosario has become a fixture at
protests against police brutality, and she has loudly blamed the
mayor for the actions of the police. When she got on the air during
the mayor's hourlong call-in show on WABC-AM, she started by
accusing him of mischaracterizing her son's case.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani quickly cut her off. ``Maybe you should ask yourself
some questions about the way he was brought up and the things that
happened to him,'' Giuliani said, defending the detectives who shot
her son and his cousin. He added: ``Trying to displace the
responsibility for the criminal acts of your son onto these police
officers is really unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   The detectives had been called to an apartment in Morris Heights
4 1/2 years ago by two tenants who said three men had robbed them
the day before and had vowed to return that night. The detectives
waited for the men and confronted them. One of the three men had a
gun but never fired a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Although an autopsy found that Anthony Rosario and his cousin
were lying face down when they were shot multiple times by the
detectives, a grand jury declined to press charges and police
officials said they found the shootings to be justified. The police
said that the detectives felt they were in imminent danger of being
shot, and that the suspects did not obey orders to drop to the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   But the Civilian Complaint Review Board, which investigates
police brutality, expressed concerns that the detectives had used
excessive force by firing 22 shots at Rosario and Vega. The third
suspect, who was shot in the leg but not killed, said that they had
gone to the apartment not as robbers but to collect a debt.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that he felt terrible for Mrs. Rosario but also
accused her of distorting the facts of the case, of ignoring her
son's criminal past and refusing to face her own responsibilities
as a parent.
</P>
<P>
   And later, at his daily news conference, Giuliani quoted remarks
Mrs. Rosario made on television last month during a congressional
hearing, in which she said New Yorkers should riot to protest
police brutality. He again expressed regret for her loss but
defended his remarks as ``quite sensitive and quite honest.''
</P>
<P>
   During the radio exchange, as Mrs. Rosario kept trying to ask
Giuliani questions, the mayor flashed some of the aggressive
prosecutorial skills for which he was famous as U.S. attorney.
``Mrs. Rosario, didn't he return to the place where he had robbed
these people the day before?'' the mayor asked. ``And he told them
that if they didn't have more money for them, he was going to kill
them, isn't that correct? And didn't your son have a criminal
record of violence?'' The police say that Rosario had had previous
arrests for robbery and assault.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Rosario finally stopped trying to speak, the mayor
turned to his larger points of defending the police and of urging
parents to take more responsibility for their children. He said
society needed to confront such matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry that I have to be as definitive about it,'' he
said. ``But I think I also have an obligation to deal with the hurt
and the harm done to these police officers who were put in a
position where they had to kill your son because he was a criminal
that wanted to kill other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rosario said that she was abruptly cut off during the
mayor's comments. In an interview later, she called the mayor's
remarks ``hurtful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't know my family,'' she said. ``He never actually
came to even apologize or even find out who we are or what we are
about.'' She added, ``We did not raise our children to be
criminals, as he is saying.''
</P>
<P>
   His press secretary, Sunny Mindel, said the mayor does not
control the calls and would not have cut her off. She said that
when the show returned from a commercial break, Mrs. Rosario was no
longer on the line.
</P>
<P>
   After the commercial break, the mayor continued on the same
theme: ``Those are actually the basic fundamental questions that
need to be asked, that often aren't and then we displace the
responsibility to the police. What about the parents? How was the
child brought up? What values were they given? What ethics were
they taught? What happened in their church? What didn't happen?
These are the basic things that create a lawful society, a decent
society.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``So we have a real hard time in New York City and
elsewhere asking these questions because they are more difficult so
we displace responsibility to other things, which sometimes have
validity but most often they are escaping the more painful
questions that need to be asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani then seemed to remember his role as talk show host and
went to the next caller. ``Now,'' he said, as coolly as if he had
just been talking about potholes and cracked sidewalks, ``we are
going to go to Meshulam in Brooklyn.''

CAN THIS SOFTWARE BE SAVED?

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: I have a Sony PCV-90 that came with a recovery
CD that will reinstall everything, including Windows 95. I
currently have Win98 Second Edition. Every time I start my
computer, I get an error that causes me to start up in Safe Mode. I
need to install the original software, but the drive has been
converted to FAT32. I have asked Sony to help me on this, but they
said it is impossible to go back. I am not a computer genius, but I
am not computer-stupid. I do know it can be done. I think they were
just too lazy. _ Helpless
</P>
<P>
   Dear Helpless: No, ``lazy'' would indicate at least a modicum of
proficiency that the Sony tech was simply unwilling to employ to
help you. ``Grossly incompetent'' comes much closer to the mark.
</P>
<P>
   Without getting too technical, FAT32 is Microsoft's new,
improved way to store stuff on your hard drive, replacing FAT16.
Because data are stored more efficiently, you can fit more data on
the drive, and programs are supposed to start faster. Windows 98
and the latest version of 95 have a handy drive converter in the
System Tools menu. The only catch is that once you convert, you
can't go back to FAT16 without buying a third-party utility like
Partition Magic. If everyone will wake up now, we'll move along. I
think I may even write something nasty, so pay close attention.
</P>
<P>
   Your registry is hammered. Sure, you could go in and twiddle
with it, but chances are you'll goober things up even worse than
they are. It's time to drop the big one.
</P>
<P>
   First you need to get rid of any trace of FAT32. I like to start
with a bootable DOS 6.22 (or earlier) floppy, but a Windows
start-up disk will work as well. There's a utility to make one in
Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel. The disk you make should
have Fdisk.com and Format.com on it. If you need drivers to make
your CD drive work, add them as well. The Win98 utility does all
that for you.
</P>
<P>
   Boot with the floppy and run Fdisk. Follow the menu, and remove
all partitions. Create a new partition, and make it active. Stop
whining, and read the on-screen instructions. Now reboot with the
floppy still in the drive. When the computer comes back up, type in
``Format C: /s'' at the prompt and have a beer while the drive is
reformatted. Don't type in the quotes. Did I really have to tell
you that? Sigh. ...
</P>
<P>
   You have a recovery CD-ROM, which quite possibly will eliminate
all the hard work. A few years ago, the better computer makers
started including these, knowing that users are idiots who will
invariably massacre their software. The recovery CD is a do-over.
Usually, you have to tell your computer to try booting from the CD
drive first (oh, go read your manual) or the CD will come with a
bootable floppy. Have another beer while the CD finishes its work.
You'll have a pristine set of software, and the computer is in just
about the same state as it was when you stole it from the loading
dock at work. Sorry, I was thinking about a little plan of my own
there.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, once your Sony is humming along on Win95, you'll have to
upgrade to 98 all over again. Then, when everything looks OK, run
the FAT32 converter and have some more beers. By this time you
ought to be feeling good enough to call Sony and give it a piece of
your mind.

verge of going under. But a smart management team helped whip it
into shape and it is now successfully rolling out stores across the
country. One of the retailer's greatest strengths is ironically the
thing that seems bizarre about it at first blush: its mix of
merchandise, which includes both home furnishings and gourmet food
and wine. Industry experts say the comestibles keep customers
coming back regularly, giving Cost Plus a competitive advantage
over its nearest competitor, Pier One, which carries similar home
goods but no food and wine. Cost Plus is giving Pier One a run for
its money as it expands outside California. By Carol Emert

   WASHINGTON _ Reacting to the crackdown on pro-democracy
supporters in Iran, thousands of Iranian-Americans demonstrated
near the Capitol Friday to decry the Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
   The rally followed a weeklong wave of protests against Islamic
rule in Iran, where scores of students were arrested in a bloody
clash with government police.
</P>
<P>
   Waving Iranian flags and singing Iran's national anthem,
protesters called for the overthrow of President Mohammad Khatami,
the moderate Iranian leader who denounced the student protests.
Khatami, elected two years ago in a landslide, had been expected to
push for change in his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all here in support of democracy,'' said Farzad Ghorbi,
37, of Boston. ``I owe it to my family. I owe it to my people. I
owe it to all the people in Iran who suffer everyday in the name of
freedom.''

   At the rally, several members of Congress urged the Clinton
administration to support Mujahedeen Khalq, the resistance group
that the State Department has labeled a terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The State Department and the adminstration would like us to
believe this fairy tale,'' said Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,
a Florida Republican. ``But siding with the tyrants who are
terrorizing the people of Iran will go absolutely nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   While both Iranian leaders and the Clinton administration call
the Mujahedeen terrorists, Ros-Lehtinen said the majority of
Congress supports the resistance group.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, told the
crowd he believed democracy will eventually win in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people want to stop this dictatorship in Iran and they
will succeed,'' he said. ``We stand with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mina Entezari, 37, who came from Phoenix just to attend the
demonstration, said, ``The events of last week is proof that we
can't work with Khatami. He has shown his true self to us and we
know that he does not stand for what we stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanya Kianfard, 17, of Atlanta summed up the protest: ``All we
are doing is fighting for freedom _ the one thing we don't have in
Iran. We want to free our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The clash between the Islamic fundamentalists and pro-democratic
students began July 8 after the shutdown of a liberal newspaper in
Tehran sparked a massive student protest. Security forces stormed
dormitories at Tehran University, throwing students out of windows.
As many as eight students died.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations spurred a counterprotest by supporters of
Islamic rule, who marched in the streets of Tehran on Wednesday to
back Khatami and Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's protest organizers criticized the US government for its
inaction following the student demonstrations in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the leaders in this country blind?'' said Soona Samsami,
of the Paris-based National Council for Resistance of Iran, the
group that oversees the Mujahedeen and the National Liberation
Army. ``How many years does this have to go on? How many people
have to die, be hanged in public and persecuted for the leaders
here to pay attention to what is happening in Iran?''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, who have been trying to establish
dialogue with Khatami with little success, said they were concerned
about any appearance of US interference in Iran.

 JETER RUMOR IS FULL OF HOLES, BUT HE ISN'T  
(DW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yankee officials were concerned. There had been a
report on an unidentified radio station that the star shortstop
Derek Jeter had been shot. As 4 p.m. came and went Friday, the time
that most Yankees are expected to be in their Yankee Stadium
clubhouse for a night game, Jeter had not been sighted. But at
4:08, the clubhouse door opened and he walked through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glad to see you,'' said Rick Cerrone, the Yankees' director of
media relations.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter nodded, but as he arrived at his locker, he noticed two
reporters approaching him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know,'' one asked, ``that you were reported to have
been shot?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shot today?'' Jeter said, laughing. ``No, I didn't get
shot today.''
</P>
<P>
   In an olive T-shirt, jeans and black-trimmed white sneakers, he
strolled into the players' lounge, but soon he returned and sat at
his locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shot? Where?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Informed that the report had emanated from Newark, he shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asleep today, man,'' he said. ``I got up at 1 o'clock.
Maybe somebody got shot with the same name. Maybe I better call my
mom.''
</P>
<P>
   As he put on his Yankee uniform, Jeter chuckled. ``This is a
first,'' he said. ``Did I live?''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter turned to Jorge Posada, the Yankee catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jorge, when we were in the car coming up here, did you hear my
name?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Posada shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard it,'' Jeter said. ``I didn't hear the first name. I
figured it was somebody with the same name. But sometimes they say
when you get shot, it takes a little time for you to feel it. But
now I know why, when I walked in, somebody said, `Glad to see you
today.'''

   NEW YORK _ Shares of Reuters Group &UR;  &LR; PLC rose Friday a day after
it said that federal prosecutors would not charge the company with
improperly obtaining information from a big competitor, Bloomberg
LP.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters American depository receipts _ each representing six
shares of the British company _ rose 62.5 cents Friday, to $86.625,
in Nasdaq trading. In London, Reuters shares rose 15 pence, to 918
pence.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in New York has been investigating the
relationship between a Reuters subsidiary, Reuters Analytics, and
Cyberspace Research Associates Inc., a New York company set up
several years ago by a former Bloomberg employee.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were looking into whether Cyberspace Research
assisted Reuters Analytics Inc. in improperly obtaining Bloomberg
data that could have allowed Reuters to copy Bloomberg's analysis
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters said on Thursday that the U.S. attorney had told the
company that prosecutors had closed the investigation. The U.S.
attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of Reuters, Peter Job, told The Associated
Press the company was gratified that no charges would be filed.

MICROSOFT VALUE TOPS $500 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Microsoft Corp. is the first company in history valued
at more than $500 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That's half a trillion dollars, nearly 50 percent more than the
assessed value of all the real estate in the state.
</P>
<P>
   It's the value of every U.S. dollar circulating throughout the
world on any given day. It's the cost of 1,100 Safeco Fields. Or
the Gross Domestic Product of Thailand, plus $45 million in change.
</P>
<P>
   The software giant hit that mark at about noon Friday, when the
price of its shares reached 97 31/32.
</P>
<P>
   Later its stock climbed even higher in heavy trading, to 99
7/16, adding another $7.5 billion to the company's market value.
</P>
<P>
   Market value is figured by multiplying the share price by the
number of shares issued.
</P>
<P>
   As the stock continues to soar, the Microsoft holdings of
chairman Bill Gates are nearing $100 billion. His 991.7 million
shares, representing 19.4 percent of the company, will hit the
$100-billion mark when the stock reaches 100 27/32. That could
happen Monday if the trend continues.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft ``continue(s) to drive the personal computer
revolution,'' said Robert Finch, a portfolio manager with Aeltus
Investment Management Inc., New York, which owns more than 7.9
million shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``They plan to go beyond the PC platform to drive the benefits
of microcomputing to a whole host of products and devices that
people are only just starting to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock has been buoyed by reports that it will
issue a tracking stock to pay for and reflect the value of its
Internet businesses. Though its performance was damped earlier this
year by a pending federal antitrust suit, it recently rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   The stock was also helped when Microsoft won a legal battle
Friday. A jury unanimously found it didn't violate federal
antitrust laws in denying access to its source code to a small
Connecticut software company, Bristol Technologies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's shares have risen almost 500-fold since it went
public in 1986, fueled by the explosive growth of personal
computers and the fervor of co-founder Gates, 43, the world's
richest person.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1985, Microsoft consistently posts earnings growth
and profits of 30 percent or more. Shares have more than doubled in
value over the past year. Its fourth-quarter results, to be
released Monday, are expected to beat analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The market has made Microsoft's value equivalent to the amount
of U.S. currency circulated worldwide every day, said Carol Eckert,
a spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   All of Washington State's private real estate was assessed at
$352 billion last year, $148 billion shy of Microsoft's value.
Safeco Field cost a relatively paltry $436 million to build. Only
15 countries have Gross Domestic Products greater than $500
billion. Australia, Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands are not
among them.
</P>
<P>
   Gates co-founded Microsoft with school friend Paul Allen in
1975. Allen in June owned 135.9 million shares, or 2.47 percent of
Microsoft, valued at $13.5 billion at Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Gates, Finch said, ``It's business acumen that's
driven his success, more than just raw technology. He's been able
to leverage good technology and make it the dominant technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The relentless rise of Microsoft stock has made millionaires out
of an estimated 5,000 current and former employees. An investment
of $100 made at the initial offering would be worth $50,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   The company's steady rise catapulted Microsoft ahead of General
Electric Co. as the world's most valuable company back in September
1998. GE is now valued at $388.9 billion.

 &HT;    Even triple-bogey doesn't thwart stormin' Norman
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Maybe a shoulder rebuilt 15 months ago is
the difference. For the second time in three major championships
this year, Greg Norman is contending seriously entering the
weekend, standing three shots off the halfway lead through the
128th British Open.
</P>
<P>
   It is the major that has enabled Norman to find whatever
ingredient always seems to be lacking at the other three.
Continually thwarted in the Masters, where he finished third in
April, Norman is a two-time British Open champion. He shot a
1-under 70 in Friday's wind-blown second round, despite a
triple-bogey 7 at the perilous par-4 17th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I've always said, once you get yourself in position, you
feel like you get back on the bike, and a flood of good stuff comes
back your way,'' Norman, 44, said. ``All of a sudden, you have a
real aggressive swing going and you've got a wonderful touch with
your putter.''
</P>
<P>
   Out in the nasty rough of the Carnoustie Golf Links, it wasn't
always so wonderful. After driving only three yards off the fairway
at the 17th, Norman had to flail from high rough with a sand wedge.
The Shark swooshed, but the ball never moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to classify it as an air swing, because I
didn't feel it hit the clubface,'' Norman said. ``I don't know what
happened to it. I think it just went back in the divot hole, and
either the club went right underneath it or the club never reached
the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman had no complaint with the width of the fairway _ just the
closeness of unplayable rough to the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   ``God (must have) come down and put fertilizer in this rough,''
Norman said. ``I've never seen grass this lush and this green that
(near) the edge of the fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman's clubs have some history in them, literally. After two
sets were stolen by a construction worker from his Hobe Sound,
Fla., home recently, Norman is using the ones he brandished for his
victory in the 1993 British Open at Royal St. George's.
</P>
<P>
   Monty ready to move on
</P>
<P>
   Scotland's Colin Montgomerie has done a swift mental exit from
the tournament, considering last Sunday at Loch Lomond he termed
his game in perfect shape for Carnoustie. Deflated by a
second-round 76, but certainly not eliminated at 8-over 150, Monty
nonetheless declared himself finished. ``I'm out of the tournament
now,'' Europe's dominant player said, ``and now I look forward to
the U.S. PGA, the next major. This is gone now. I'm just playing
for numbers, unfortunately, now.'' After a birdie at the 14th,
Montgomerie bogeyed three holes in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap slips but makes cut
</P>
<P>
   Scott Dunlap slipped to a 77 but is in decent shape at 7-over
149. He double-bogeyed the par-3, 250-yard 16th hole, which was
downwind enough for a 6-iron that caught the right bunker. Dunlap
splashed to the rough, chipped to five feet and missed the putt.
``I'm still trying to figure out which one of the five shots that I
hit was bad,'' he said. During two days, Dunlap said, he has been,
``collectively off line by about four yards'' at the 16th hole and
lost three strokes to par.... Atlanta's Billy Andrade (75-84_159)
and Duluth's Stewart Cink (82-80_162) both missed the cut.... Nick
Faldo missed the cut for the first time in 24 appearances, and his
second-round 79 was his highest ever in this event. ``Played bad,
putted lousy, that's all I can tell you,'' Faldo said.

 &HT;    'Carnasty' hangs tough
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Finding a summation of the 128th British
Open required just a visit with Atlanta resident Billy Andrade late
Friday afternoon at the Carnoustie Golf Links. Andrade withstood a
13-over-par 84 to miss the cut by five shots, then left the course
for a root canal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' said Andrade, ``is the state of my golf right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to be an appropriate example. After 36 holes at the
place they are calling Carnasty, the leaderboard is almost as weird
as Andrade's week.
</P>
<P>
   Out in front by one stroke at 1-over-par 143 is 33-year-old
Frenchman Jean Van de Velde, a qualifier who managed a 3-under-par
68 in taking advantage of less wind in the morning hours.
</P>
<P>
   One stroke behind him at 2-over 144 is Argentine Angel Cabrera,
an obscure South American Tour player who had a 69.
</P>
<P>
   The first familiar name is Sweden's Jesper Parnevik, who added a
71 to his opening 74 and is at 3-over 145. Then comes the trio of
American Tiger Woods (72), two-time British Open champion Greg
Norman (70) of Australia and Sweden's Patrik Sjoland (72) at 4-over
146.
</P>
<P>
   The cut came at 12-over-par 154, ending play for defending
champion Mark O'Meara (83-74), three-time champion Nick Faldo
(78-79), 1996 champion Tom Lehman (76-80), 1975 Carnoustie champion
Tom Watson (82-73) and Spanish sensation Sergio Garcia, who
finished last in the field at 89-83_172.
</P>
<P>
   What happened Thursday did not necessarily affect Friday.
Australia's Rodney Pampling (71-86) became the first player in Open
Championship history to lead after the first round and miss the
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Americans Len Mattiace (74), Justin Leonard (74), the 1997
British Open champion, and 1998 runner-up Brian Watts are tied for
seventh at 147, along with Australian Bradley Hughes (71), just
four shots off the pace.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the order on the leaderboard, there's no doubt
about today's featured pairing _ Woods and Norman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in very good shape,'' said Woods, 23, who finished a
stroke out of the playoff at Royal Birkdale last year.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde, who lists Disneyland as a sponsor, started playing
golf as a youngster. He asked his parents during trips to their
summer home in Biarritz to drop him off at a nearby spot to play
``mini-golf.'' Or, as he called it, ``funky golf.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while,'' he said, ``they brought me to the real
game.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, this week, back to funky golf. Not that Carnoustie's
ribbonlike fairways and high rough have confounded Van de Velde,
who has the appearance of a French Fred Couples. Anyone playing in
the morning Friday had a great advantage over the afternoon, when
the wind stiffened heavily. However, the average score was down for
the day, from 78.3 to 76.9.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde, whose best Open finish is a tie for 34th in 1993,
seized the opportunity, making four birdies and a bogey. While
Woods and Norman faltered coming home, Van de Velde birdied Nos. 16
and 18, with a 45-foot birdie on the par-3 16th and a wedge to a
foot at the finish.
</P>
<P>
   Of the most significant weekend of his professional life, the
Frenchman said calmly, ``I heard that there is always a first
time.... I know it's a major championship, but it's just a golf
tournament.... It's just a matter of staying focused to what I have
to do, stay within myself and try not to do anything silly.''
</P>
<P>
   While unknown to the American audience, Cabrera is not without
credentials, finishing second to Garcia two weeks ago at the Irish
Open. Not without good fortune Friday, he was helped to a par at
the 18th when the wind blew a putt in from the lip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can play with big names,'' Cabrera said, through an
interpreter, of the star players around him. ``I'm playing within
my game and I only see the course. I don't know who is behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik, who has two seconds and a fourth in the British, said
he is suffering from a sore hand, a fever and hay fever and ``would
have taken a 78 or 79'' on Friday. ``To shoot 71 is beyond my
dreams, actually,'' he said.

 &HT;    U.S. still no shoo-in in doubles
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Pete Sampras is in and Todd Woodbridge is
out, but it doesn't mean that the United States is favored to win
the doubles point today.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras has played doubles four times in Davis Cup, winning
twice with John McEnroe in 1992 and once with Todd Martin in 1995,
but Sampras and Martin were beaten by Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde
in the 1997 semifinal against Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can play good doubles,'' Sampras said. ``It's still the same
sport out there _ keep it in the lines and serve big and return
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aussies were weakened when Woodbridge took himself off the
team last week, citing a sore arm and poor confidence. He was
replaced by Sandon Stolle, ranked No. 4 in the world in doubles and
winner of the U.S. Open with Cyril Suk.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' partner, Alex O'Brien, has lost both of his Davis Cup
doubles matches, including a five-set defeat against England's Tim
Henman and Greg Rusedski in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Cup rules allow captains to change their doubles pairings
as close as an hour before the scheduled match, which would be 1
p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   The legends of Longwood
</P>
<P>
   The Longwood Cricket Club is known as the oldest tennis club in
the country and the site of the first Davis Cup competition, but
neither claim is precisely correct. Bud Collins calls Longwood
``the oldest significant tennis club in the U.S.,'' which probably
doesn't appease the New Orleans Lawn Tennis Club, established a
year before Longwood in 1876. The first Davis Cup competition,
between the United States and a British Isles team, was played at
Longwood's original location in 1900. The club was moved a few
blocks to its present site in 1922 and still provides lawn tennis
to its members.
</P>
<P>
   Winning on principle
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gullikson's decision to adhere to Sampras' wishes to play
only doubles opens the way for criticism if the U.S. team doesn't
win. It is reminiscent of another sporting but unusual move by the
1971 U.S. captain, Ed Turville. The United States was going to play
Romania in the final in Charlotte, and Turville didn't think it was
fair to put the Romanians on hardcourts, which favored the
Americans. So he ordered clay to make it ``entertaining for the
fans.'' Cliff Richey quit the team in protest, but his replacement,
Frank Froehling, defeated Ion Tiriac in five sets, and Stan Smith
upset Ilie Nastase, and the U.S. prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   The United States leads the Davis Cup series with Australia
25-19, although the Aussies lead in finals 15-14. ... The U.S. team
is 9-3 when Sampras plays, 9-3 when he doesn't. ... The 362 media
credentials issued represent a record for a U.S. Davis Cup match,
which was sold out in 81 minutes and attracted scalpers asking for
$250 a ticket. ... Former President George Bush attended Friday's

 PLUS _ SF CHRON  
 Cost Plus' Quirkiness Pays Off  
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Ray Duplain, a history lecturer from Australia, stops in at the
Cost Plus World Market on Fisherman's Wharf every time he's in San
Francisco.
<P>
   Earlier this week, Duplain picked up a bottle of wine, some
Pelligrino, and two hand-carved figurines. ``You wouldn't find that
anywhere else,'' said Duplain, fingering a small wooden cat with
rope knees and dangling legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I`ve never seen another shop like it, and I've been all over
the world,'' said Duplain, who has visited the store periodically
since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Duplain's purchases embody, in microcosm, the unique formula
that is propelling Cost Plus from a quirky California business that
was near insolvency five years ago to an up-and-coming national
retailer and Wall Street darling.
</P>
<P>
   Cost Plus, headquartered in Oakland, features two very different
categories _ gourmet comestibles and home furnishings with two
common qualities: they're eclectic and they're inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   Although marrying two seemingly unrelated categories under one
roof is an unusual retailing strategy, it has a major, hidden
advantage: the wine, European cookies, Texas rice mixes and other
gourmet treats bring shoppers into the store more frequently than
if they were looking only for home furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   The edibles also attract the 50 percent of the shoppers that
doesn't generally relish looking for home goods: men.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the door, both male and female shoppers typically wander
through the store and pick up things for the house, like a
fish-shaped umbrella stand, a knickknack shelf from Indonesia, an
Italian butter dish, some wrapping paper or a wrought iron candle
holder.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is merchandise that appeals to a person who has their own
sense of style,'' said Murray Dashe, Cost Plus' chief executive
officer. ``It is unconventional because, frankly, conventionality
is the kiss of death for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The wine department is strategically located in the back of the
store to maximize impulse buying along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Impulse items ``are where the opportunity lies'' for Cost Plus,
said Helen Bulwik, director of global retailing for Anderson
Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Bulwik regularly buys wine at Cost Plus and generally winds up
with more in her shopping cart. Recently, for example, she took
home a $100 deck umbrella. ``I had no intention of buying a deck
umbrella,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Retailing analyst Ralph Jean calls the food and beverage
department Cost Plus' ``secret weapon.'' The treats give Cost Plus
a competitive advantage over its closest rival, Pier 1 Imports of
Fort Worth, Texas, which carries similar home items but no food, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Another Cost Plus advantage is that prices of comparable
merchandise tend to run 10 to 15 percent cheaper than at Pier 1,
said Jean, with First Union Capital Markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Cost Plus formula seems to be working: Although 37 percent
of the Oakland retailer's revenues come from small-ticket food
products, its stores generate sales of $260 per square foot,
significantly higher than Pier 1's $200 per square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Cost Plus is rolling out stores around the country, ``I
think Cost Plus will systematically take market share from Pier
1,'' Jean said.
</P>
<P>
   Jean's enthusiasm is typical on Wall Street, where Cost Plus
shares have more than tripled over the past 18 months. Shares have
risen to $46.50 at yesterday's close from $15 in January 1998, when
Dashe took the company's helm.
</P>
<P>
   Pier 1's shares, meanwhile, have fallen to &UR;  &LR; $9.69 from about $15
over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   That's largely because Cost Plus, with 94 stores, has ``huge
growth potential,'' said Elizabeth Pierce, an analyst with the
Siedler Companies.
</P>
<P>
   Cost Plus' store count is growing by 20 to 25 percent annually,
and Dashe aims to eventually hit 400 _ with possible international
expansion after that. It now operates in 16 states as far east as
Ohio and is on a steady march toward the Eastern Seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   Pier 1, meanwhile, operates 730 stores in 49 states and about 70
abroad. Pier 1 Chief Financial Officer Steve Mangum said his
company is shopping for a higher-end furnishings chain to satisfy
growth-oriented investors and revive its stock.
</P>
<P>
   Pier 1 is also taking on Cost Plus by lowering its prices, a
strategy that reversed sales declines in a few markets where it
competes with Cost Plus, said Mangum. However, in most markets
where the two companies both operate, Pier 1's sales have not been
affected, he added.
</P>
<P>
   As Cost Plus moves into more Pier 1 markets, Mangam forecasts
minimal impact. ``If they get uppity, maybe I'll buy them,'' he
said with a leisurely Texas drawl.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Pier 1 and Cost Plus share common roots. In the
early 1960s, when Cost Plus ran about a dozen locations, Tandy
Corp. bought a handful of Cost Plus franchise stores, renamed them
Pier 1 and expanded the chain quickly.
</P>
<P>
   While Pier 1 grew, Cost Plus, which was founded in 1958 with the
Fisherman's Wharf store, stuck closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Bartlett and Jack Amthor, the chain's founders, ran Cost
Plus successfully until the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Cost Plus changed hands twice and lost its
direction, accumulating $40 million in debt during a leveraged
buyout. Ralph Dillon, the president of Family Dollar Stores, was
named chief executive and began a turnaround in 1990. &UR;  &LR; However,
because of its debt load, Cost Plus was on the brink of insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   Two new investors, Goldman Sachs and ING Capital, bought the
debt and restructured it in 1994, and Cost Plus went public in
April 1996. Cost Plus' performance has exceeded the wildest
expectations of the early investors, said Ed Mul &LR; e(CQ accent over &LR; 
the e please) &LR; , a Goldman Sachs managing director and former Cost
Plus board member.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Pierce estimates that Cost Plus' sales will grow to
$389 million and hit $477 million in 2000. Net income is projected
to rise to $17.7 million in 1999 and $22.2 million the following
year. The company has exceeded analysts' earnings estimates for
five consecutive quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cost Plus is not home free. Managing a national expansion
is a far more complicated endeavor than running 40 stores in and
around California, the position Cost Plus was in as recently as
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And it is always possible that Cost Plus, like any retailer,
could lose sight of consumers' tastes and start making bad
merchandising decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no glaring problem on the horizon that they they have
to be concerned about, but you always have risk with respect to
merchandising and execution,'' Mul &LR; e &LR;  of Goldman Sachs said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's management team, led by Dashe, is extremely
strong, said Mul &LR; e &LR; . For example, Kathi Lentsch, who has worked at
both Pottery Barn and Pier 1, runs the merchandising operations.
John Hoffner, the chief financial officer, is a veteran of Dayton
Hudson and Federated Department Stores.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  One change ahead is the company's name. Amthor and Bartlett
dubbed their first store Cost Plus because the merchandise was sold
at cost plus 10 percent. Today the World Market moniker seems more
fitting, and in new markets such as Indiana and Ohio stores are
simply called World Market.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area stores may never do away with the Cost Plus name
altogether. But over the next 18 months, store signs will be
changed to highlight the World Market theme.

HOUSE PASSES BILL TO HELP AFRICA IMPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ind., Mich., Miss., Mo., N.C., N.Y., S.C., Texas) (rk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Friday approved a far-ranging American
economic initiative for Africa that offers enhanced trade benefits
in exchange for the adoption of free-market practices by African
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, passed by a vote of 234-163, would authorize
quota-free and duty-free imports from 48 sub-Saharan African
countries, including some of the world's poorest nations, for 10
years, with a particular focus on textiles and apparel.
African-made textiles currently face import taxes of 15 to 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   If the legislation, known as the African Growth and Opportunity
Act, were to become law, it would be the first major
trade-promotion measure enacted in the United States since the 1994
North American Free Trade Agreement that established duty-free
commerce between Canada, the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The African legislation has been quietly percolating along
through Congress for months. President Clinton, who has strongly
supported such a measure since he visited Africa in 1998, began a
concerted effort to push for passage earlier this year. House
Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois is also a strong supporter.
</P>
<P>
   But the legislation still faces big opposition in the Senate,
which rejected a similar measure last year. It also comes against a
backdrop of increased trade protectionism in the United States,
where companies in industries such as steel and textiles fear a
rising tide of inexpensive imports could hurt profits and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the African legislation argue that U.S. trade with
Africa is relatively small and any increased imports from Africa
would have no harmful effects on the healthy American economy.
American merchandise exports to the region totaled $6.7 billion in
1998 while imports from Africa amounted to $13.4 billion. By
comparison, U.S. trade with Japan alone totaled $180 billion last
year, according to Commerce Department figures.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's supporters also contend that removing all quotas and
taxes on African products would stimulate economic growth in the
region and nurture the increasing number of fledgling democracies
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will open a new era in for U.S. relations with
sub-Saharan Africa,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who heads the
House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's vote, Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade
representative, said in a statement that the House had taken ``a
vital step toward promoting further economic growth and reform in
Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for Senate passage are unclear, even though its
version of the bill is more restrictive. It would require, for
example, that African nations use American raw materials in the
manufacture of their textile exports to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version is also incorporated into broader trade
legislation that includes a Carribean Basin Initiative, backed by
Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. policy has virtually ignored Africa,'' said Sen. Richard
Lugar, R-Ind., who is the Senate's main sponsor of the measure.
``This bill encourages a transition from aid to trade for
sub-Saharan countries committed to economic and political reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill does not affect foreign aid to African countries.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition in the House and Senate comes largely from
Southeastern lawmakers whose districts have large numbers of
textile workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here wants to help Africa, but we don't want to do it
on the backs of U.S. workers,'' said Rep. Richard Burr, R-N.C.,
whose district around Winston-Salem includes 22,000 textile
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Textile and apparel imports from sub-Saharan Africa represented
less than 1 percent, or $383 million of the $46 billion worth of
all such imports in 1996, according to the International Trade
Commission. A commission study found that even if all quotas and
duties were removed, African textiles would still likely remain
below 2 percent of total U.S. textile imports over the next 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say they do not fear direct competition from African
businesses. Rather, they are concerned that large quantities of
inexpensive textiles from countries like China may be shipped
illegally through Africa to the United States. Supporters insist
the bill includes tough safeguards against that practice, called
transshipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a national holiday in China when we pass this
bill,'' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The trade bill divided House Democrats, many of whom complained
that the Africa legislation failed to include adequate protections
for African workers and the environment. In Friday's vote, 136
Republicans and 98 Democrats supported the bill, while 63
Republicans, 99 Democrats and one independent opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, voted for
the bill, while Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic whip,
or No. 2 official, voted against it. Gephardt, however, opposes a
Caribbean Basin Initiative and would oppose combining it with the
Africa bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Black Caucus was also badly split over the
bill. Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the ranking Democrat on Ways
and Means, has championed the Africa trade bill over the past
several years, and he personally lobbied several wavering
Democrats, House aides said.
</P>
<P>
   But 14 of the black caucus' 36 members opposed the bill Friday,
led by Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill. These critics say that
multinational companies will exploit African workers, and that the
bill did not address other key issues like debt relief and AIDS in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me where in this bill it says multinationals must hire
African workers?'' Jackson said during Friday's debate on the House
floor.

 EBay Frowns on New Online Auction Browser  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
An Indianapolis software company has come out with an ``auction
browser'' designed to help eBay junkies track bidding contests and
to sound a warning if a particular auction is coming down to the
wire.
<P>
   EBay is not amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lawyers are looking at it closely,'' Kevin Pursglove, a
spokesman for the San Jose online auctioneer, said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The auction browser _ essentially a modified version of
Microsoft's Internet Explorer _ was released via the Web on
Thursday night by ZCurve Software. It sells for $19.95, and a
30-day demo version is available in a free trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction has been extremely positive,'' said ZCurve
President Bob Hays. ``We've gotten a high amount of traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the idea for the auction browser came from his own
experience bidding for movie and computer collectibles. He realized
that the real action came only in the last five minutes of bidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're away from your computer, you miss that,'' Hays
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   To remedy this situation, he said the auction browser will sound
an alarm when the bidding grows heated. It also will allow users to
combine separate auctions in a single tracking window, thus
permitting a bidder to keep tabs on both that hard-to-find Steve
Lawrence album and that must-have Wonder Woman Pez dispenser.
</P>
<P>
   Two special buttons on the browser are marked with eBay's name:
One takes users directly to eBay's site and the other takes users
to eBay's search window. There are also buttons for adding auction
items to the tracking window.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay's name is featured prominently as well in a press release
issued by ZCurve.
</P>
<P>
   Hays admitted that he never discussed either creation of the
browser or its marketing with eBay officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have appreciated the courtesy of advance notification
about using the eBay name so liberally,'' Pursglove said, noting
that the company's attorneys are looking into whether ZCurve may
have violated copyright or trademark laws.
</P>
<P>
   No less significantly, the auction browser allows users to
continue following an eBay bidding war even while visiting other
Web sites. This means ``eyeballs'' have left the auctioneer's
content _ and ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things that take people off our site are not good things,''
Pursglove said.
</P>
<P>
   ZCurve's Hays said he hadn't contacted Microsoft in advance
either, but in this case it doesn't seem to be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encourage developers to take bits and pieces of the IE code
for their own applications,'' said Mike Nichols, a Windows product
manager at the Redmond, Wash., software giant. ``We build the
software in such a way that you can build on top of it.''
</P>
<P>
   EBay may not be as understanding, at least if a recent company
announcement for a new eBay magazine and a pair of how-to books on
online auctions are any indication.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every mention of the firm's name is accompanied by a
trademark or copyright symbol, and the fine print sternly warns
that ``designated trademarks and brands are the property of their
respective owners.''

 Providian Withdraws Online Ad Contested by Rival NextCard  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Providian Financial Corp., the nation's ninth-largest credit card
company, has offered an olive branch to an online rival that sued
it for allegedly ripping off the look of its Internet ad.
<P>
   In a Thursday letter to NextCard's attorney, Providian's lawyer
said the company had stopped running the ad in question and hoped
``to discuss a possible accommodation to put this matter finally to
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   NextCard, the largest all-Internet credit card issuer, filed
suit in U.S. District Court in San Francisco Wednesday accusing
Providian of copying one of its online banners showing a
thermometer to symbolize falling interest rates. Banner ads allow
Internet users to click on an image and jump directly to the
advertiser's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The case has drawn wide attention because it could help
determine how copyright and trademark laws apply to online
advertising. Both NextCard and Providian are based in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Providian yesterday made available correspondence between its
attorney and NextCard's showing it had offered to settle the matter
before the suit was filed. At the same time, Providian said
NextCard's suit had no merit.
</P>
<P>
   In a press release issued yesterday, Providian said the
thermometer ad was one of more than 20 banners it tested. The
company said it dropped the banner after one week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no reason to believe that consumers associate
thermometers uniquely with any company or product,`` Providian said
in its release.
</P>
<P>
   A NextCard spokesman confirmed the company's attorney had
received Providian's Thursday letter and said the suit is still
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Providian launched Aria, its special Internet brand, in May. It
said it looked to Internet sales as one of its principal growth
avenues.

RAUL SALINAS' SENTENCE IN MEXICO MURDER IS CUT TO 27{ YEARS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to correct coding.)   (ko) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ An appeals court Friday reduced the murder
sentence against Raul Salinas de Gortari, the brother of the former
president, by nearly half, to 27{ years, from 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   That bit of relatively good news for Salinas, who was convicted
on Jan. 21, came with another pleasant surprise. The highest court
in Switzerland announced Friday that it had overturned the
confiscation of more than $90 million of his money, a rebuke to
Swiss Attorney General Carla del Ponte.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss court found that Mrs. del Ponte had no authority to
seize the money on the supposition that it included proceeds from
drug trafficking. But the ruling was based on the intricacies of
Swiss law and did not absolve Salinas of the money-laundering
charges.
</P>
<P>
   His money in Switzerland remains frozen, and local authorities
there can still prosecute him, even though the attorney general
cannot.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mexican ruling on his sentence, the appeals court in
Toluca, about 50 miles west of Mexico City, said it had halved
Salinas' sentence, which had been the maximum under Mexican law,
because the prosecution had failed to show any motive for him to
have committed the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mexican law, the lack of a motive is not a basis for
acquittal in a homicide case but may, as in this one, lessen the
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas was convicted in the 1994 assassination of Jose
Francisco Ruiz Massieu, a prominent politician who had once been
his brother-in-law. The appeals judge found that since Salinas had
been convicted as the instigator and not the gunman, he should not
be given the maximum sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court also doubted the credibility of a witness on
whom the prosecution relied heavily, Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez.
Rodriguez was convicted of murder for hiring the gunman. His family
received payments of about $500,000 from prosecutors just before he
changed his testimony to implicate Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas' murder conviction marked a historic break with a
tradition in Mexico of impunity for the rich and politically
powerful. But the case raised new doubts about Mexican justice,
because it relied heavily on witnesses who had been paid by
prosecutors or had been caught in clumsy attempts to frame Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Luengo Creel, Salinas' defense lawyer, visited him
Friday morning and emerged from prison to say Salinas had once
again insisted that he was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never came up with a motive for him to do it,'' Luengo
said Friday. ``He had nothing to do with that crime.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there would be a further appeal, which would eventually
end up in the Supreme Court. But he said that first he had to
restudy the 131,164-page record of the original case and the 7,819
pages of the appellate decision.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that the final appeal might not be filed under
2001, when President Ernesto Zedillo, who ordered the prosecution
to go forward, leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Luengo was especially pleased about the Swiss ruling that any
money-laundering investigation was a matter for cantonal
authorities and not federal ones like Mrs. del Ponte.
</P>
<P>
   The court barred Mrs. del Ponte from any further investigation
in the case and ordered her to pay $15,000 to Salinas' lawyers and
$3,000 in fees to the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``She acted as though we were living in the age of the
Inquisition,'' Luengo said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. del Ponte carried out her investigation in secret, giving
Salinas no opportunity to present a defense. She traveled several
times to the United States to interview jailed drug dealers who

 Schwab's Profit Nearly Doubles From Year Ago  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Charles Schwab Corp. said yesterday its second-quarter profit
nearly doubled from a year ago, as customers set up accounts and
moved money to the firm at a sizzling pace.
<P>
   But the San Francisco brokerage warned it will spend more on
advertising and technology in the months ahead, squeezing profit
margins. That spooked investors who pushed Schwab's shares down
yesterday $2.94 to $52.44.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, the nation's largest discount and online broker,
reported net income of $151 million (18 cents a diluted share) for
the quarter ended June 30, up 98 percent from $76.3 million (9
cents) in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's revenue leaped 54 percent as customers sharply
stepped up their trading activity compared with last year. During
the quarter, Schwab handled an average of 203,700 trades a day
compared with 127,400 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Schwab's stock was vulnerable to the warning on
profit margins because it trades at such a lofty level, about 75
times estimated earnings or roughly three times the level of the
average stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have the right business model, but when you have
a stock priced like that, there's always the potential for
weakness,'' said J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Michael
Freudenstein.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in Schwab's business reflected an accelerating stock
market boom that's been fueled by the growing popularity of online
trading. More than two-thirds of Schwab's trade orders were entered
by computer in the second quarter, the highest proportion ever.
</P>
<P>
   In the year ended June 30, assets held by Schwab customers
jumped 38 percent to $592 billion, including $242 billion in mutual
funds. Accounts grew to 6.2 million from 5.3 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab said its revenue grew so fast that it overwhelmed its
ability to reinvest cash in its business. That in turn kept profit
margins artificially high.
</P>
<P>
   ``More money fell to the bottom line, where we would normally
ramp up our investment program,'' said co-Chief Executive Officer
David Pottruck.
</P>
<P>
   The firm plans to step up spending for marketing, international
expansion and services to ethnic communities in the United States,
Pottruck said. For example, Schwab will boost the number of
branches targeted at Chinese language speakers to 12 from five over
the next year.
</P>
<P>
   While far above last year's levels, customer trading volume in
the second quarter actually fell 4 percent compared with the
beginning of the year. Propelled by Internet stock mania, stock
market volumes smashed all records during the first three months of
1999, overwhelming the ability of Schwab and other retail brokers
to serve customers.
</P>
<P>
   A trading dip in May and June gave Schwab a respite, during
which it upgraded its computers and hired hundreds of employees.
</P>
<P>
   Even though trading volume fell, Schwab increased its profit 5.7
percent from the first to the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That's because other forms of income more than offset lower
commission revenue. Those income sources included higher mutual
fund fees, interest on margin loans extended to customers and
income generated as a wholesale stock trader for institutional
clients.  &LR;

U.S. DRUG CONTROL CHIEF SEEKS $1 BILLION FOR COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to correct coding.)  (ko) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   with CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Alarmed by recent advances by Colombian
guerrillas who are involved in drug trafficking, the Clinton
administration's top anti-drug official is asking that the United
States make $1 billion in emergency assistance available to the
Colombian government to strengthen its efforts against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The request by Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of the Office of
National Drug Control Policy, comes as Colombia's defense minister
and the chief its armed forces are in Washington on an official
visit. In meetings on Thursday and Friday, the Colombian military
officials said they were seeking an additional $500 million in U.S.
aid over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are preparing modern armed forces that, if peace can be
achieved, will guard our borders and natural resources,'' Defense
Minister Luis Fernando Ramirez said on Thursday. ``That is the
country we dream of. But we are also preparing the armed forces for
war, if need be.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of attacks beginning July 8, units of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the country's principal
left-wing guerrilla group, came within 25 miles of the capital
before being driven back. On July 10, President Andres Pastrana
imposed a limited curfew in 10 of Colombia's 32 provinces but has
also said he plans to go ahead with peace talks with the guerrillas
that are scheduled to begin on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey's recommendation, which would dramatically increase
U.S. support for Pastrana if approved, calls for $1 billion in
``emergency drug supplemental'' assistance for Colombia and other
drug-producing countries during the fiscal year beginning in
October.
</P>
<P>
   The request is contained in a letter and discussion paper he
sent to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Attorney General
Janet Reno, copies of which were obtained by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said Friday that Albright had
received the letter but that no decision on the request had been
made. Congressional Republicans have generally assistance for the
Colombian government in drug eradication efforts and in its
campaign against guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting with Ramirez and Gen. Fernando Tapias in
Washington Friday, McCaffrey said he would ``not publicly discuss
the details'' of any recommendations he has made to other U.S.
officials. But he made it clear that he strongly favors the
Colombians' request for increased U.S. support and announced plans
for a three-day visit to Colombia at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia is in a near-crisis situation,'' he said. ``This is
an emergency.'' He added that, because ``criminal trafficking
organizations have done serious damage to Colombian national
security over the past few years,'' the United States has an
obligation to ``support the Colombian government as it attempts to
reassert democratic control over its drug-producing regions.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing Thursday at the School of the Americas at Fort
Benning, Ga., Gen. Charles Wilhelm, commander-in-chief of the U.S.
Southern Command, played down recent guerrilla gains. He said the
insurgents ``have not had a single real tactical success.'' But at
the same time he seemed to acknowledge the Colombian military's own
problems on the battlefield, saying they are ``not losing'' their
war against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Formally, all U.S. aid to Colombia, which produces most of the
world's cocaine and most of the heroin consumed in the United
States, is intended for anti-drug rather than counter-insurgency
efforts. But in practical terms, the distinction is fading, as
Tapias made clear Thursday when he said, ``The aid we are seeking
is to fight drug-traffickers and any group that helps them.''
</P>
<P>
   After meeting several U.S. senators on Thursday, Ramirez said
Colombia wanted the money to buy more military helicopters,
interceptor planes and radar equipment. In remarks carried in
Friday's newspapers here, he said the Colombian government also
``hopes to obtain on loan some of the equipment the Southern
Command had at Howard Air Force Base in Panama'' before closing
operations there in May.
</P>
<P>
   But the McCaffrey proposal would provide much more aid in a
shorter time than the Colombians are seeking. According to the
letter, the emergency aid would include $360 million to bolster
existing anti-drug operations in southern Colombia, and an
additional $130 million ``to establish Colombia's ability to
interdict in southern Colombia,'' a region increasingly dominated
by the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The United States argues that eradication efforts have
substantially reduced coca growing in the Guaviare region, a
traditional cultivation area. But recent satellite images indicate
a surge in coca and heroin poppy cultivation in the Putumayo and
Caqueta areas, which are largely under guerrilla control,
contributing to a 25 percent increase in the past year in the
acreage devoted to growing drugs in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Under the McCaffrey proposal, Colombia would also receive $30
million to ``enhance regional intelligence programs'' in order to
``increase collection and improve assessments'' of information
obtained by satellites, radar and electronic intercepts. An
additional $200 million would also be earmarked for improving U.S.
interdiction efforts in the air and sea lanes north of here.
</P>
<P>
   A study published by the Government Accounting Office last month
revealed that the United States had begun sharing intelligence on
guerrilla activities with the Colombian government in March.
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Benning on Thursday, Wilhelm acknowledged that U.S. and
Colombian military officials had been in constant communication
throughout the weekend, appearing to confirm Colombian news reports
that devastating bombing attacks on the guerrillas were based on
information provided by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Any increase in aid to Colombia would have to be approved by
Congress, which has sought to bolster the Pastrana government ever
since it came to office last August.
</P>
<P>
   With the enthusiastic support of leading Republicans like Rep.
Benjamin Gilman, Congress agreed last November to more than triple
U.S. assistance to the government here to $289 million, making
Colombia the largest recipient of U.S. security aid after Israel
and Egypt.

 Labor Relations in S.F. Approaching Flash Points  &HT;     By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Forget the cold fog: This could be a hot summer for labor relations
in San Francisco.
<P>
   Two of San Francisco's biggest and most activist unions _
representing hotel workers and janitors at downtown office
buildings _ each have citywide contracts that are set to expire
within the next four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Local 87 of the Services Employees International Union, which
represents 3,500 janitors at about 300 office buildings, has a
contract that will expire on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Local 2 of the Hotel Employees &AMP; Restaurant Employees Union,
which represents 4,000 workers at 11 Class A hotels, has a contract
that will expire on August 14. In addition, Local 2 represents
another 4,000 workers at about a dozen other hotels with separate
contracts that will expire shortly after that.
</P>
<P>
   Both unions have been holding rallies the past several weeks to
mobilize their members and they plan an unusual joint rally next
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Both hope to take advantage of the current booming economy to
win significant wage and benefit increases.
</P>
<P>
   The janitors, for instance, say claim that  &LR; their current wages
of $9.80 to $14.05 per hour have lagged behind inflation by 9
percent since 1988. They're seeking ``catch-up'' raises in addition
to cost of living increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all American unions, in 1999 these unions are asking for
more money than three or five years ago when the economy appeared
to be in a different place,'' said Stuart Korshak, a lawyer for the
11 hotels with the joint contract, including the Hilton, Sheraton
Palace, Fairmont and Westin St. Francis.
</P>
<P>
   However, the issues in both sets of talks go beyond
dollars-and-cents issues.
</P>
<P>
   One big issue in the janitorial talks is the union hiring hall.
The janitorial companies are asking for an end to the decades-old
hiring hall practice, where the union dispatches workers to meet
employers' staffing needs.
</P>
<P>
   The companies say that the hiring hall process makes staffing
unnecessarily complicated and that the union sometimes sends them
workers with bad performance records. They want to be free to hire
whomever they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janitors have been fired for theft or sexual harassment, but
then they go back to the hiring hall and get recycled to a
different employer,'' said Robert Ford, a lawyer representing the
half-dozen janitorial firms involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   But Local 87 officials say the hiring hall protects workers
against favoritism. They say the companies are trying to make it
easier to lay off senior, highly paid workers and replace them with
new lower-paid staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, if a senior worker is laid off they can at least
get a job through the union,'' said Richard Leung, President of
Local 87. ``Without the hiring hall, they will have no protection.
Employers will be able to fill all the jobs with people who have
less seniority, at a lower wage scale.''
</P>
<P>
   The non-wage issues in the hotel talks include pension
improvements and housekeepers' workload.
</P>
<P>
   Local 2 also wants some provisions to help it organize other
hotels. For instance, Local 2 wants the companies to allow workers
to unionize at any new hotels they may open simply by signing union
cards not going through the longer process of a National Labor
Relations Board election.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel owners are seeking changes in some job descriptions
and work rules that they say will give them greater flexibility in
meeting guests' needs.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the hotel talks seems to be moving more smoothly
than the janitors' talks. That may be partly due to the fact that
Local 2 and the hotel owners launched a labor-management
``partnership'' five years ago aimed at working together more
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we reject a lot of their proposals, the discussions are
cordial and respectful,'' said Local 2 President Mike Casey.
</P>
<P>
   Local 87 and the janitorial firms, meanwhile, seem to be finding
little common ground on issues such as the hiring hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been bargaining for weeks now and time is running out,''
said Leung of the janitors' union. ``People don't want to strike.
But they feel they have no choice but to fight back if their job
security and standard of living is under attack.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNBAR, W.Va. _ Ken Hechler may be the only active candidate in
the post-Monica era of American politics who gets away with
singling out female strangers in a crowd of constituents, holding
out his arms, and grinning as he gently asks, ``May I give you a
hug?''
</P>
<P>
   In receiving multiple hugs one day this week for his daring,
Hechler, West Virginia's elected secretary of state for the past 15
years, was helped by the fact that he is an 84-year-old political
legend who was wooing a gray-haired sea of retirees at the crowded
Kanawha Valley Senior Services picnic.
</P>
<P>
   The tableau was revealing. For West Virginia now has the oldest
per capita population in the union _ having overtaken Florida in
1996. Its senior residents, in the upper half of a population with
the median age of 38.6 (Florida's is 38.3), include a record tide
of returning natives who choose to come home to retire after
careers elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``A significant factor in their return is the intrinsic bond in
the Appalachian culture between the people and their land,'' said
Thomas Dudley, research director for the state Bureau of Senior
Services. Recent studies, he said, have established the state as
leading the nation in attracting back original residents for
retirement. They come in particular from urban areas in the East,
attracted by West Virginia's lower cost of living and its rural,
recreational spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The current estimate is that with the elderly now accounting for
15 of every 100 state residents, the graying trend will continue
upward to almost 25 per 100 by the first quarter of the new
century. The state, which is widely recruiting non-native retirees
the way Florida does, is making adjustments, with its seniors far
more politically active than its young.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that Hechler, unfinished with a political career
seeded in the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, has decided that
a politician as old as he is can be the wave of the future. Though
he would seem a shoo-in for state re-election, he has decided to
run once again next year for his old seat in Congress, which he had
retired from after 18 years in 1976 when he turned to statewide
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is a series of challenges and I don't want to just coast
along here,'' said Hechler, a classic maverick who already has
banjo-picking campaign ads on the radio. To counter any bias that
he is too old, he is offering his four younger primary challengers
free baseball throws at him next week when he sits in the dunking
stool at the Berkeley County Democratic picnic.
</P>
<P>
   He campaigns from a signature red jeep, always with young people
at his side, often mentioning the four games of tennis he plays
each week. ``I'm saving golf for my old age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With the oldest age average in the country, we don't expect
any age bias in our politics,'' said Robert Perelman, the president
of the rapidly growing state chapter of the American Association of
Retired Persons. He is a 77-year-old former chemical plant
supervisor who teaches skiing in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Hechler is not alone as a political patriarch. The state's
governor, Cecil Underwood, is 76 and a popular phenomenon himself,
having been the nation's boy wonder governor in 1956 at the age of
34, and then returning to politics in 1996 to be elected as the
oldest governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning seniors do vote, but also that politicians will
live longer and be more active, too,'' Earl Jarvis, director of
Kanawha Valley Senior Services, said of the evolving lesson of West
Virginia. ``I'm encouraging more of my people to run for public
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Hechler has lived a rich life as a college professor, researcher
for Roosevelt, speechwriter for President Truman, book writer
(``The Bridge at Remagen,'' a best seller about the World War II
crossing of the Rhine), and elective politician in Congress. There,
he bucked the state's coal industry and capped a career with the
landmark Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to go back to Washington for far more than the obvious
issues brought up at the seniors' picnic _ keeping Social Security
and health-care programs effective for the elderly. He passionately
campaigns for stronger controls on political fund raising and
handguns and for a half-dozen other issues, telling voters he can
hardly be seeking a long, safe House career anchored in
poll-tailored evasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``God will be setting my term limit,'' says Hechler rather
nonchalantly. ``But I don't want to be known as the candidate of
the seniors,'' he insists. As a native New Yorker, he moved here in
the 1950s, fresh from working in the idealistic campaigns of Adlai
Stevenson, to teach political science at Marshall College and try
to engender fresh interest in politics among the young.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a legend,'' said Bill Walker, a 24-year-old political
science student from Marshall working the picnic crowd at Hechler's
side as a summer intern. ``Just to someday look back and say I
learned politics from Hechler is a great honor,'' said the student.
He exuded the dedication of one of the young interns in the special
state program in which elderly mountaineers have been reinstilling
the art of fiddle playing lost by earlier generations who had to
emigrate for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, people my age are soured on politics lately,''
said Walker, who is determined to run for political office at the
earliest opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   As the elderly come to the fore, state politics are shifting to
consider issues like how the revenue base will hold up as more
retirees claim special tax abatements. ``Most studies show incoming
retirees are actually increasing the economic base,'' said Dudley
of state senior services. ``They bring in an average of $250,000 in
liquid assets, and they're a tremendous resource in volunteer work,
politics and civics.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all the states, West Virginia faces the potential trauma
from the retirement of a wide swath of talent when the baby boomer
generation hits 65. ``We'll feel it a little quicker,'' said
Dudley. But he noted there are all sorts of variables, including a
slow but promising downturn from the state's traditional loss of
young workers, plus a redefinition of retirement itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Close to half of the governor's Cabinet came out of retirement
to serve,'' noted Dudley, who is busy preparing for Underwood's
regional conference in September on the problems and opportunities
of the elderly. Next year, West Virginia will play a principle role
in the United Nation's International Year of the Older Person when
it hosts the conference on rural health.
</P>
<P>
   Hechler appreciates those issues but puts more passion into
railing against mechanized mountain-top coal mining and its effects
on the environment, citizenry and general attractiveness of West
Virginia now that all the retirees are flocking in. He has been
hiking the state on this issue, just as he has been hiking
nationally for campaign finance reform, a buoyant old New Dealer
come round one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's Ken Hechler,'' an elderly woman told her friend as
the candidate confronted them at the picnic. ``You ought to know
him _ he's been around 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Hechler, a whippet on the hustings, instantly responded: ``One
hundred years! Whoopee!'' And he asked if he might give the woman a
hug.

PARNEVIK MANAGES PAR   AMID HIS SNIFFLING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Sweden)   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Jesper Parnevik usually plays well when
he doesn't feel well. He started Friday's second round of the
British Open with a high temperature and was bothered by allergies.
Little wonder that he shot an even-par 71, leaving him at 3 over
par for the tournament (145), just two strokes off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 2 over after six holes, and actually close to walking in
after five,'' said Parnevik, who has three top-five finishes at the
British Open since 1994 without a victory. ``I would have taken a
78 or a 79. To shoot a 71 is beyond my dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik played most of his round with tissue stuffed in one
nostril to stop his nose from running.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal coming here was to give myself a chance,'' Parnevik
said. ``If I can be there on the back nine Sunday having a chance,
then I'm pleased with what I have achieved this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Just Happy to Be Here
</P>
<P>
   Patrik Sjoland, tied for fourth place at 4 over par through two
rounds, found himself in contention at a major for the first time.
But Sjoland never takes golf for granted. In 1992, he was nearly
killed when he was thrown through the sun roof of his car in an
accident. Sjoland spent a month in intensive care. His spleen was
removed, and his career was in jeopardy. But at 28, the native of
Sweden has developed into one of the top players on the European
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the tournament all Europeans would like to win,''
Sjoland said. ``When I was injured in my car crash, it was moments
like this which kept me going. I never gave up. I didn't hit a golf
shot for five months. I said to myself I was lucky to be alive.
Playing good golf is a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval Can't Figure It Out
</P>
<P>
   David Duval (79-75) has endured a difficult two days, including
a terrible finish on his last four holes Friday _ bogey, bogey,
double-bogey, bogey. Having barely made the cut, the world's No.
2-ranked player will leave Carnoustie still looking to win his
first major championship.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would take from his Carnoustie experience, Duval
said: ``The hope that you don't have to encounter it again. I don't
know what you can learn. Maybe sitting back later I might figure
something out, but I don't know right now. Obviously, I need to hit
it a lot better than I did and make more putts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't dislike the golf course. I just think it's really,
really tough right now. You can't judge your game on this course.
Good shots end up in the hay. Bad shots end up on the green. I
think my game's OK, but I really couldn't tell you.''

 &UR; DETECTIVES  &LR;  _ The Internet may be a godsend for people doing
research or managing their finances. But the ready availability of
online information has been a blow to those who make their living
snooping into other people's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Some private detectives say their business has fallen off
dramatically as potential clients conduct their own investigations
on the Net. San Francisco's venerable Lipset Service, which has
been poking into the city's shadows for more than 50 years,
estimates that its business has declined 40 percent since ordinary
people have been able to conduct searches online. By David Lazarus

   &UR; AT&AMP;T _  &LR; On a recent visit to San Francisco, C. Michael
Armstrong, the chairman of AT&AMP;T, seemed remarkably calm about a
controversial issue that's pitted his company against America
Online in a nasty and public fight. Last month, a federal judge in
Portland, Ore., ordered AT&AMP;T to open its cable lines to competitors
in that city so others could offer high-speed Internet access over
AT&AMP;T's lines. AOL, along with other Internet service providers, is
a vocal proponent of ``open access'' which would allow the giant
service to give its customers a superfast on-ramp to AOL's content
and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong, the visionary leader of what will soon be the
nation's largest cable operator, is unfazed. ``I'm not concerned
this ruling will stand,'' Armstrong said. ``It's against the law,
it's against any rational behavior and it's against the contract we
have with the city of Portland.'' By Deborah Solomon

   &UR; STAMPS &LR;  _ After months of testing, the Postal Service is set to
put its, er, stamp on a plan that would allow customers to buy
stamps over the Internet and print them directly onto envelopes and
mailing labels. PC Postage, the Postal Service's first big step
into electronic commerce, could be available nationwide by the end
of summer, Patricia Gibert, the agency's vice president for retail
sales, said during a demonstration on Wednesday.The program targets
an estimated 8 million small business and home office customers who
find stamps inconvenient, but don't want to buy or rent a mail
metering machine. By Henry Norr

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ Perhaps the most illuminating impression
one gets from a stroll through the Buckminster Fuller Institute, a
cramped warren of offices in the balcony of an old movie theater
here, is how familiar all the artifacts produced by this great
thinker seem today.
</P>
<P>
   The geodesic domes, the Dymaxion maps, the tensegrity models and
octatrusses, all Fuller inventions that at one time seemed
radically new, have become ubiquitous in the late 20th century.
Though the terminology may still be obscure to some, his designs
are common in everything from playgrounds to giant shopping mall
roofs to soccer balls. Indeed, Fuller's clever geometric vocabulary
has so insinuated itself into the grammar of contemporary design
that it takes a few moments to realize that some of the objects at
the institute _ a Balinese woven basket, a turtle shell, a spiky
stuffed puffer fish _ that Fuller had collected and studied sprang
from sources other than his awesomely original mind.
</P>
<P>
   It is just as revealing, though, that one of the least familiar
images at the institute may be that of R. Buckminster Fuller
himself. The kindly-looking old man in a business suit with close
cropped white hair and thick glasses, the man who graced the cover
of Time magazine in 1964 as a towering genius and who was widely
known as Bucky, has slipped, much like the institute, from the
public's mind.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the reasons that Fuller's daughter, Allegra
Fuller Snyder, and his grandson, Jaime Snyder, are about to finish
transferring the huge archives at the institute, hundreds of boxes
of letters _ he seems to have saved nearly every one he ever wrote
or received _ manuscripts, photographs, blueprints and videotapes,
to Stanford University in Palo Alto after several years of planning
and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The donation seems unlikely to resuscitate Fuller to the cult
status he had when he wrote ``Operating Manual for Spaceship
Earth'' and was embraced by the Whole Earth Catalog and its
followers in the 1960s. But the family hopes the donation will
foster renewed interest in his extraordinary and at times deeply
subversive ideas about everything from home construction (he
designed a cheap prefabricated house that was suspended from a mast
in the 1920s) and automobiles (in the 1930s he made a three-wheeled
cigar-shaped car that went 120 mph on a 90-horsepower engine) to
political organization (he thought military expenditures a colossal
waste and felt governments generally frustrated a more even
distribution of wealth).
</P>
<P>
   In short, his descendants say it may again be time for people to
be exposed to a romantic visionary who had few commercial
instincts, little use for accepted wisdom and extraordinary
foresight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt he was surfing history in a sense, trying to
anticipate the trends,'' Ms. Snyder said. ``Now some of those waves
have come in. There's also a different kind of chemistry today,
especially among young people, and that opens doors to his thinking
once again.'' The intellectual exile into which Fuller's ideas
seemed to slide and the spark of new interest in his prodigious
work, which Stanford hopes to enhance by organizing and cataloging
his archives, is a commentary on shifting fashions in ideas.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he died in 1983 at 87, Fuller and his work were
already falling out of favor, Ms. Snyder said. He seemed out of
step with a time when there was suspicion of anyone who rejected
traditional thinking so cheerfully and thought in such grandiose
terms. The earth was almost too small a unit, and he frequently
spoke of the universe and man's place in it. His selfless creed was
that people should gather not wealth but information and knowledge
with the purpose of sharing it to make society more successful by
improving living standards.
</P>
<P>
   He hewed to an absolute ethic of technological efficiency, of
producing more with fewer resources, a motivation that created
astounding results but that he regarded as the minimum society
should expect if people liberated their minds as he had. In 1957 a
large geodesic dome auditorium was built so swiftly in Honolulu
that 22 hours after the parts were delivered a full house of
hundreds of people were happily taking in a concert.
</P>
<P>
   When Ronald Reagan became president and the country took a turn
to the right, Fuller became identified with the counterculture. Yet
Ms. Snyder and other experts on his work regard such a
characterization as misleading and argue that he was a victim of
the reaction against the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   E.J. Applewhite, who collaborated with Fuller on his two-volume
behemoth, ``Synergetics: Explorations in the Geometry of
Thinking,'' said that it was true that Fuller was even more radical
than many so-called 1960s radicals. But that had nothing to do with
his lifestyle, which was fairly conventional. He was from an old
New England family and, though twice thrown out of Harvard as a
youth, nearly always wore business suits and spent much of his
career teaching at universities. His grandson, Jaime Snyder,
recalled being taught table manners by Fuller, a staunch New
England Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   What was so unusual about Fuller, Applewhite said, was that he
was completely apolitical and believed not in philosophies but in
principles for problem-solving. What he disliked were impediments
to technological solutions of common problems. Chief among those
impediments, in his view, were tradition and cultural legacies,
which thwarted the clear-eyed thinking needed to invent efficient
ways of improving people's lives. He said change was not only good
but also essential to saving the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I am,'' he once said. ``I know that I am not
a category. I am not a thing _ a noun. I seem to be a verb, an
evolutionary process, an integral function of the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His free thinking appealed to a new generation eager to break
old intellectual models and enticed by the liberating promise of
all kinds of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people, dropouts, loved him because he said you don't
have to earn a living,'' said Applewhite, who collaborated with
Fuller for several decades even though he had spent his career
working for the CIA, which Fuller loathed. ``But these people
generally ignored the rest of what he said, which was that you have
to just do what has to be done. Just see what the needs of society
are, and fill them.''
</P>
<P>
   His thinking was so eccentric that he was often regarded as
something of a crackpot until his ideas started to prove themselves
and found their way into common use. No one ever took him up on his
idea of covering Manhattan with a dome, for instance (he believed
the savings in snow removal alone would pay for the structure), but
the U.S. pavilion at Expo '67 in Montreal was in a memorably giant
geodesic dome and his octatrusses, a lightweight, strong honeycomb
of a structure that can span great distances, are common at
shopping malls and convention centers.
</P>
<P>
   He ultimately had 25 patents, wrote 28 books, received 47
honorary doctorates and was awarded the Presidential Medal of
Freedom. He invented not only objects (he called them artifacts)
but words as well with an eye to literalness. For instance, he
called people earthians, referred to sunsets as sunclipses and
prefaced the names of many of his inventions with the term
Dymaxion, a combination of dynamic, maximum and tension.
Globalization, now a popular concept, was an idea he championed,
along with the development of wind, solar and wave power. In turn,
he became a name: When scientists discovered a new type of carbon
molecule in 1985 that resembles his geodesic dome, they called it a
buckyball.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his life, ever eager to share his vision, he
recorded a 42-hour program on video, ``Everything I Know,'' a
precise catalog organizing his thoughts. It typified his
earnestness and his unshakable confidence that mankind could
accomplish any practical task, assuming people had the patience to
sit through the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his disciples have continued to work on his ideas, and
in Europe he still is a celebrity, at least in some circles. There
is a huge exhibition on him, ``Your Private Sky: R. Buckminster
Fuller and the Art of Design Science,'' at the Zurich Museum of
Design in Switzerland. Ms. Snyder said no show of that breadth has
ever been mounted by a museum in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His descendants are hoping that the transfer of his archives to
Stanford, where they will be more accessible, will allow a new
generation to discover Fuller. His grandson said he believed Fuller
represented a positive, optimistic side of the '60s that has been
obscured by current cultural debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The utopianism he stood for was emblematic of the '60s,''
Snyder said. ``I think Bucky, in the best sense, really believed in
progress. In that sense, the whole '60s thing hasn't gone away.
It's sort of gone underground, and some of these ideas may be
coming to the surface again.''

 &HT;    U.S. in deep hole in Davis Cup
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Maybe it was the honorable thing to do,
keeping Pete Sampras on the bench Friday, but now the U.S. Davis
Cup team is in a hole that it hasn't dug itself out of in 65 years.
</P>
<P>
   With Sampras watching, using a towel to shade himself from a
brutal summer swelter at the Longwood Cricket Club, the pony-tailed
Lleyton Hewitt wore down Todd Martin 6-4, 6-7, 6-3, 6-0, and
two-time U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter beat Jim Courier 7-6,
6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. trails Australia 2-0, a deficit an American team has
overcome just once in 29 tries this century, most recently against
Australia in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, an 18-year-old in his Davis Cup debut, made the graying
Martin, 29, look old and tired in the opener. Martin gave Hewitt
most of his points on errors, 79 in all, and was unusually loose on
service returns. Hewitt routinely ran the slow-footed Martin from
corner to corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best win I have ever had,'' said Hewitt, who also has
victories over Andre Agassi and Rafter (twice), but never on such a
grand stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first match was a key one for them,'' said Australian
captain John Newcombe, who theorized that the gravity of replacing
Sampras as the lead singles player weighed on Martin's mind
</P>
<P>
   Martin denied it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Pete weren't the initiator of all this, then I would be a
little bit uneasy,'' Martin said of Sampras' insistence on playing
only doubles here.
</P>
<P>
   Courier played OK, but Rafter showed why many regard him as the
best hardcourt player in the world, certainly the most gifted at
capturing the net.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter yielded only 13 points in his final 10 service games.
Courier won two-thirds of the points when he wasn't aced or when
Rafter was kept at the baseline, but there was no fending off the
world's No. 2 player, who won 30 points at the net (24 with clean
winners on overheads and volleys). Sampras enters the fray today,
paired with Alex O'Brien against Mark Woodforde and Sandon Stolle.
</P>
<P>
   Even after a winless opening day, U.S. captain Tom Gullikson
remained firm that the Sampras decision was sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning and losing doesn't change that,'' he said.

THREE PBS STATIONS ADMIT SHARING DONOR LISTS WITH DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y., D.C., La.)  (th) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At least three public television stations in the
nation's largest markets say they have been sharing donor lists
with Democratic fund-raising groups, a practice that may be legal
but one that some congressional Republicans suggest could
jeopardize public financing of all public television and radio
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting have
condemned the practice and said Friday that they were trying to
determine its extent in preparation for a congressional hearing set
for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Public television stations in New York, Washington and Boston
acknowledged that they had sold or swapped donor lists with
Democratic groups in the past, but added that they had stopped
doing so and fired those who were responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The admissions by the stations _ WNET in New York, WGBH in
Boston and WETA in Washington _ have angered Republicans on Capitol
Hill, who view them as confirmation of long-held convictions that
public television leans to the political left and should not be
financed with tax dollars. The federal government provides about 15
percent of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting's $200 billion
annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofit organizations are prohibited from engaging in
political activity. But the Internal Revenue Service says that such
organizations can sell or rent their mailing lists to candidates or
parties if they makes the lists available to all candidates and
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the stations said that, in some cases, they had
made their lists available to both Democratic and Republican
groups. But they said they were concerned about possible
misperceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that our viewers and listeners could reasonably
interpret as a partisan act, we shouldn't engage in,'' said Robert
T. Coonrod, president of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
``The health of public broadcasting is built on the trust we have
with our viewers and listeners, and anything we do that might erode
that trust is just not smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Coonrod said the practice of list-swapping was common in
industry, but that it was not common with political organizations.
He said the corporation did not condone the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Collins, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee,
said that his organization had ``never leased a public broadcasting
list,'' but he said that in rare cases it had used lists from
charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's reckless,'' he said. ``It puts these public broadcasters
in a very embarrassing position with regard to their donors and a
dangerous one with regard to the IRS.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Backus, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National
Committee, said the practice of list-swapping was common and that
the television stations had done nothing unusual. She said the list
broker employed by the DNC had provided a list of 123 organizations
from which the committee had selected 62, including WGBH.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any way of knowing that WGBH had an internal
policy against this,'' she said. ``This is standard practice
conducted on the open market.''
</P>
<P>
   But many public stations prohibit work with political
organizations. WNYC, the public radio station in New York, is one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't make our list available to political organizations,''
said Ted Roebuck, a WNYC spokesman. ``We have to turn down those
requests pretty often, and just last week we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about list-swapping were first raised when The Boston
Globe reported in May that WGBH had exchanged membership lists with
the Democratic National Committee on two occasions _ a move that
Republicans said initially appeared to be isolated. But Friday,
officials at public stations in New York and Washington
acknowledged that they, too, had shared their fund-raising lists.
</P>
<P>
   Stella Giammasi, a spokeswoman for WNET in New York, said that
an internal investigation revealed ``that without our knowledge and
through some misinterpretation of our policy, the list brokers we
employ had made our list available to both Democratic and
Republican organizations,'' which she would not name. ``We can only
guess this was done as a purely commercial gesture. It did not
reflect station policy, and they were fired,'' she said. She would
not name the list broker.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Giammasi said there had been more than one instance of
list-swapping but the matter was still being investigated. Still,
she sought to assure the station's donors that their names were not
being sold for political purposes by noting that donors are given
the chance to ``opt out'' of having their names given to other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Giammasi acknowledged that this still posed a political
problem for public stations in general. ``We're always worried
about our funding,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans came to power four years ago attacking public
broadcasting as liberal and elitist and promising to eliminate
federal contributions. But broad public support for programs like
``Sesame Street'' helped silence Republican hostility.
</P>
<P>
   As Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La.,
chairman of a subcommittee that oversees public broadcasting, put
it: ``From a practical political standpoint, it was a public
relations nightmare for Republicans to talk about shoveling dirt on
Big Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Congress increased its support for public
broadcasting. And earlier this month, Tauzin's committee was
preparing to raise the authorization for next year to $300 million
from $250 million. It was also providing money to help public
television with its $1.7-billion conversion to digital broadcasting
in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   But the disclosures that the stations have shared their donor
lists with Democratic interests, including the Democratic National
Committee, have prompted Tauzin to scale back federal
contributions. He has also vowed to impose restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels betrayed, misled and lied to,'' said Johnson. ``We
had many members committed to some type of increase for fiscal
2000, only to have this blow up in our faces. It reinforces the old
stereotypes, it picks the scab off the wound and it opens up public
broadcasting to another big fight on Capitol Hill.''

ANALYSIS: SOUND, FURY, STALEMATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mont., Okla., Mass.)  (With CONGRESS-HEALTH) 
(mk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By the time the Senate's four-day debate over
managed care ended Thursday night, each party had won something.
The Democrats had put the Republicans on record against some
emotional health care proposals _ stands which they expect to
highlight in the next campaign. The Republicans, for their part,
passed a modest health care bill that they believe will shield them
from attack next year.
</P>
<P>
   The ones likely to be left empty-handed were members of the
American public. President Clinton's threat to veto anything
resembling the Senate bill means there is little likelihood that
any legislation on managed care will become law this year unless
the House takes an unexpected course.
</P>
<P>
   As Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said at one point Thursday morning:
``The debate that's going on now is one of the most partisan and
the most vacuous, the most devoid of effort to try to reach a
solution that I've heard in a long time _ and that's saying
something.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the off-year between congressional
elections was considered the period in which political passions
cooled enough for serious work on legislation. But these days, with
an all-campaign-all-the-time atmosphere in the capital, that is no
longer the case.
</P>
<P>
   So managed care, for all the sound and fury, is more likely than
not to become just another example of the kind of stalemate
gripping this Congress. The sparring over the issue was so intense
that one measure on which everyone in the Senate chamber agreed _
an effort to bar insurance companies from forcing women to undergo
mastectomies as out-patient surgery _ could not gain a unanimous
vote. The Republicans voted for their amendment on the measure and
the Democrats voted for their own version.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a gun control bill collapsed in the House under
similar circumstances as Democrats chose to vote against a modest
Republican gun control measure that they considered flawed rather
than allow Republicans to say they had done something in the
aftermath of the Littleton, Colo., massacre.
</P>
<P>
   An overhaul of the Social Security system is stalled both
because the two parties violently disagree over how to change the
system and because each side resists giving the other any kind of
credit for saving the popular retirement program. And with the
Republicans once again making a major tax cut the crown jewel of
their legislative agenda, the parties have fallen into their
familiar fight, with the Democrats accusing the Republicans of
putting tax cuts ahead of protecting the Medicare system.
</P>
<P>
   This year's intense partisanship is partly caused by the
Republicans' slim hold on power in the House, where a Democratic
gain of just six seats next year could put them in the majority.
But it is also the case that the political mood of the country is
causing Democrats to be more aggressive and the Republicans more
defensive than in years past.
</P>
<P>
   And that has created its own odd dynamic on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent poll conducted jointly by Ed Goeas, a
Republican, and Celinda Lake, a Democrat, congressional Democrats
currently hold their traditional advantage over Republicans on
issues like health care, Social Security, Medicare and education,
while Republicans in the aftermath of the Clinton scandal have a
sharp lead over Democrats on the issue of values.
</P>
<P>
   Because of such findings, Democrats have tried to push to the
fore their own agenda to draw public attention to issues where they
have a lead, and Republicans have tried to undermine the effort by
blunting the differences between the parties on such issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have had the most leverage over the agenda in the
Senate, because the chamber's arcane traditions and rules allow the
minority to cause paralysis. So the Republican leadership has bowed
to Democratic demands that gun control and managed care come up for
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   But the subsequent debates have been less about legislating than
about shadowboxing for the next campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the Republicans responded to the Democrats with
more limited measures designed to defuse the issue. But in the case
of the gun control debate, the amendments the leaders crafted were
so weak that enough Republicans bolted from their party to give the
Democrats victory in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   This week, on managed care, the Republicans were far more
masterful, in part because they had known they would face a battle
over this issue for months. Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the majority
whip, assembled a health care task force and worked hard for weeks
to satisfy both Republican moderates and conservatives. His work
produced party unity, and on the final vote, only two Republicans
abandoned the party.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill they produced went nowhere as far as the Democrats'
version. While many consumer protections in the Republican bill
would not apply to most of the people in health maintenance
organizations, the Democratic version would have applied to all 161
million Americans with health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Clinton and his Democratic allies to weigh whether
to accept a small step and try again another year. But that would
mean giving Republicans an achievement they could cite in their
campaigns, even though they had done much less than what the
Democrats themselves wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   So the president and Vice President Al Gore both signaled that
they would opt for a veto _ and a campaign issue _ unless some
markedly different bill emerges from the House. Said Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., ``This isn't an issue that's going to go away.''

SENATE TAX PROPOSALS SHOW POTENTIAL FOR COMPROMISE
</HEADLINE>
   (ko) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans and Democrats in the Senate laid out
dueling tax-cut proposals Friday, but both sides said they saw room
for eventual compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The tone was a marked contrast to the fight over taxes in the
House, where both parties have laid out hard-line positions without
making any attempt at finding common ground.
</P>
<P>
   In a first move toward a possible deal, Democrats on the Senate
Finance Committee introduced a plan that would cut taxes by $295
billion over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic plan is far smaller than the $792 billion cut
proposed by Sen. William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., chairman of the
Finance Committee. But in a nod to Republican priorities, the
Democratic plan is built around a broad-based cut in personal
income taxes, an approach President Clinton has been resisting.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana said Friday that he was one of a
number of Democrats open to a reduction substantially larger than
the $295 billion, though nothing as large as Roth had in mind. Like
other Democrats, he said a deal was possible in the end, although
both parties believe serious talks will come after Congress passes
and Clinton vetoes some version of the current Republican plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who has been around longer than five days in this
business knows that any kind of a major tax bill is ultimately the
result of compromises by everybody who is involved in writing the
package,'' Breaux said.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of any deal will be complicated. Not only are there
the obvious differences between the parties, but there are tensions
within each party as well. Among House Republicans a small band of
moderates is pressing the party's leadership to scale back their
$864 billion tax cut, saying money should remain available for
other issues including Medicare and spending programs.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Friday that the House bill, which was approved
by the Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday, may well be trimmed
back to the size of the $792 billion Senate version.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason, they said, would be to avoid parliamentary
complications arising from a dispute between the House and Senate
budget committees over how large a tax cut this year's budget
outline provides for. But the chance to mollify moderate
Republicans in the House, where the party's slim 223-211 majority
means even a handful of defections can endanger its chances of
passing legislation, would be an added benefit, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is just as complicated in the Senate, where Roth
laid out details of his proposal on Friday. It includes a reduction
of the bottom income tax bracket to 14 percent from 15 percent,
steps to eliminate the so-called marriage penalty that makes
two-income couples pay more taxes if they file jointly and
expansions of Individual Retirement Accounts and the 401(k)
retirement savings program.
</P>
<P>
   Roth said his plan was already a step toward compromise, since
in deference to Democratic preferences its income tax cut was
designed to benefit low- and moderate-income people as much as the
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to put something together here that I thought
would appeal across the aisle, as well as with my own
Republicans,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Committee has a long history of bipartisan
pragmatism, and if there is to be a crucible for a compromise on
taxes this year, the committee is a likely candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But Roth has to watch his right flank, where conservatives are
grumbling about his decision to leave out of his bill some of their
priorities, including a reduction in all income tax rates and a cut
in the capital gains tax.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, some of the most influential Democrats on the
committee, like Breaux and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, are more open to
a big tax cut than many of their colleagues in the party as a
whole, and it is unclear how much resistance there will be among
Senate Democrats to a split-the-difference deal.
</P>
<P>
   The $295 billion proposal set out Friday by Democrats does not
move very far from the plan advocated by the White House, which
calls for a $250 billion tax cut in the form of incentives for low
and middle income households to save more for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   It is based on the principle that the projected budget surplus _
nearly $1 trillion over the next decade, excluding money earmarked
for Social Security _ should be evenly divided between tax cuts,
new spending and Medicare, said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New
York, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee. Clinton uses
much the same formulation.
</P>
<P>
   But its main component is one more attractive to Republicans
than the retirement savings plan offered by Clinton. It would
reduce the income tax bill for many taxpayers by substantially
increasing the standard deductions. For a married couple filing
jointly, for example, the standard deduction would increase to
$11,550 from $7,200, resulting in an annual saving of as much as
$650 for a family in the 15 percent tax bracket and as much as
$1,200 for those in the 28 percent tax bracket.

 &HT;    Forbes camp slams Bush on Iowa donations
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Six wealthy backers of George W. Bush, all
barred from giving more money to his presidential campaign because
they have reached the federal limit, have pitched in $50,000 to
help Bush at next month's Iowa straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   The news drew immediate fire from the Steve Forbes campaign,
which complained Friday that the Bush backers found a way to pump
more money into the already cash-rich Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The supporters sent checks of $10,000 or $5,000 directly to the
Iowa Republican Party to pay for the rally site leased by Bush near
the coliseum where the Aug. 14 event will be held.
</P>
<P>
   The $43,500 rental fee was set this month when the Bush campaign
was the high bidder in an auction for the sites. No other campaign
spent more than $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Though the purchase was made by the Bush campaign and the site
will directly benefit his efforts, the fee is being paid by the six
donors, all of whom have made the $1,000 maximum contributions
federal law allows _ prompting questions of legality by the Forbes
camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had a campaign determine the value of that land by
bidding. They determined it was worth $43,500. Now they have
contributors write the checks,'' said Forbes aide Bill Dal Cal.
``They are using it for campaign activities. That's got to be a
campaign check to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign and the Iowa Republican Party say it's
legal, ethical and appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual contributions were made to the Iowa Republican
Party. All of the money goes to the Iowa Republican Party. None of
it comes to the Bush campaign,'' said Bush spokeswoman Karen
Hughes. ``We were happy to encourage our donors to support the Iowa
Republican Party because strong state parties help all Republican
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the campaign looked for contributors who already had
hit the $1,000 limit ``and said they would be happy to help in any
other way.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to paying for the rally site, the money will be used
for other straw-poll related expenses, including paying the $25
admission fee for participants.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Stewart, the Iowa GOP's executive director, said the straw
poll is nothing more than a fund-raising event for the state party.
There are no limits on how much a person can donate to the party,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not an election,'' he said. ``We appreciate presidential
candidates raising money for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said the money from the Bush backers provides no direct
benefit to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is not an election how does it directly benefit a
candidate?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's not running an election, the Iowa GOP has been
generous in pitching the straw poll as a crucial landmark in the
2000 presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will only succeed in the Iowa Caucus if you do well in the
straw poll,'' Iowa GOP Chairman Kayne Robinson said earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   A June 10 memo from the Iowa GOP told candidates the party would
accept ``individual, political candidate committee and political
action committee checks'' to cover the cost of rally sites at the
coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Four Bush backers each sent $10,000; Dallas investor Ray Hunt,
Los Angeles investment banker Bradford Freeman, Detroit businessman
Heinz Prechter and Michigan real estate investor C. Michael
Kojaian. Five thousand dollar checks were sent by Dallas investor
Louis Beecherl and Florida homebuilder John Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Bush reported Thursday that he has raised more than $37 million,
a record, for his campaign. He has about $30 million in the bank.
No other GOP contender has more than $3 million.

THE APOCRYPHAL Y1K PROBLEM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:   Texas, Ill., Mass.)   By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Patricia Bernstein, a Houston writer long fascinated by the
Middle Ages, began research for an article about the year 1000, she
was under an impression shared by many educated Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The turn of the last millennium, she believed, was a time of
apocalyptic panic, fevered preaching, penitential excesses and, for
the Christian faithful, ominous signs and wonders. Daily work was
set aside and property, even family, abandoned as Christian Europe
waited in both dread and hope for the end of the world and the Last
Judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Y1K problem. All very exotic, very dramatic and, as
it turned out, very likely untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bernstein had barely begun her research when she found that
historians generally dismiss this vision of what happened at the
turn of the last millennium. More surprising yet, they had been
dismissing it for more than a hundred years.
</P>
<P>
   To mimic Gilbert and Sullivan, this climax apocalyptical was
actually quite apocryphal. It was a tale, the historical consensus
went, that was concocted out of far more imagination than evidence.
``Alas for human fallibility!'' lamented George Lincoln Burr, an
American historian, as early as 1901.
</P>
<P>
   At the most elementary level, there was the problem of the
calendar. More than four centuries before the year 1000, Dionysius
Exiguus, a monk and mathematician, devised a calendar that numbered
years forward and backward from what he thought was the date of
Christ's birth, rather than from various dates in Roman history or
other starting points. But as Europe approached the millennium,
this calendar was still not universally used.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did everyone agree on the date when one year ended and the
next began _ whether it was Christmas, Jan. 1, March 25, Good
Friday or Easter. Rural life was measured less by years than by the
cycles of planting and harvesting, holy days and the feast days of
saints.
</P>
<P>
   So were there religious terrors and overwrought expectations of
the Final Judgment in the year 999? Absolutely. Also in the years
899, 1199, 1299 _ you name it. One might as well turn the question
around and ask, ``How could it have been otherwise?''
</P>
<P>
   In the period before the millennium, Christian outposts in
Europe were struggling against wave after wave of invaders, among
them Muslim Saracens and pagan Vikings and Magyars. In addition,
there were the usual run of famines and epidemics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medieval folk lived in a more or less constant state of
apocalyptic expectation,'' said Bernard McGinn, a leading scholar
of medieval religion at the University of Chicago. The problem,
McGinn wrote in the ``Encyclopedia of Apocalypticism'' (Continuum,
1968), which he edited, is that ``it is by no means clear that
fears of the end were more general circa 1000 than at other periods
in the Middle Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   So how did the idea of millennial frenzy a thousand years ago
originate, and why?
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Bernstein, that became the real question. The answer, as
she recounts it in the most recent issue of Smithsonian magazine,
has a lot more to do with modern beliefs than medieval ones.
</P>
<P>
   Her search for an explanation led to the year 1605 and Caesar
Baronius, a Roman Catholic cardinal. Writing a church history after
Reformation-era upheavals and polemics, Baronius said that at the
turn of the first millennium rumors of the coming of the Antichrist
abounded.
</P>
<P>
   Working its way into many standard accounts, the cardinal's
statement was further elaborated by Protestant and rationalist
historians who were predisposed to contrast their own Age of Reason
with what they viewed as Catholic superstition in the earlier Dark
Ages.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Jules Michelet, a 19th-century French historian, who
etched this tale into modern consciousness. In his epic accounts of
the Middle Ages and the French Revolution, Michelet portrayed the
French people as a kind of collective Romantic hero struggling
against the tyranny of priests and kings.
</P>
<P>
   In his multivolume ``History of France,'' Michelet painted a
vivid picture of the year 1000, with prisoners, serfs, monks and
lords universally awaiting the trumpet blast announcing the end of
the world, and painfully torn between fear of divine wrath and
anticipation of divine justice. It was a picture that perfectly
expressed Michelet's outlook, equating religion with superstition,
endowing ordinary people with a potentially revolutionary energy
and satisfying the Romantic taste for melodramatic conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on an analysis of the Y1K problem by the historian Peter
Stearns of Carnegie-Mellon University, Ms. Bernstein reports that
Michelet's successors indulged ``an even stronger antichurch
rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Later French writers suggested that greedy churchmen had
encouraged millennial fears deliberately so that people would give
their material possessions to the church in hopes of salvation,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Writer after writer added macabre and colorful details, and the
story migrated into poems, plays and popular novels even as
historians began to pick it apart.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not all historians. Michelet has something of a defender
in Richard Landes, a medievalist who directs the Center for
Millennial Studies at Boston University and who presents his case
on the center's Web site (www.mille.org). As Ms. Bernstein
acknowledges, Landes maintains that apocalypticism did reach a
crest _ if not exactly around the year 1000, then in the decades
before and after.
</P>
<P>
   If there is scant documentary evidence for that, Landes says, it
is because the churchmen who wrote the history and preserved the
records were embarrassed by the fact that the world did not come to
an end. More importantly, they were constrained by church teaching
that condemned efforts to predict exactly the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a conspiracy of silence and censorship is
intriguing. In one respect it turns the earlier argument upside
down: instead of a church malignly whipping up apocalyptic fervor
in order to seize the flock's belongings, here is a church sternly
stamping out apocalyptic fancies in order to preserve its own
credibility and to discourage any radical visions that could
threaten its established status. Either way, of course, the church
is the villain.
</P>
<P>
   But McGinn told Ms. Bernstein that Landes' ``hidden
millennialism is a figment of his imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   That appears to remain the prevailing view.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be, therefore, that the fears and hysteria surrounding
the coming of the year 1000 were nothing compared to those
surrounding the coming of the year 2000? If so, who is living in
the Dark Ages?

 &HT;    Apollo astronauts reunite for 30-year anniversary
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Thirty years from the day humans first
left Earth to walk on the moon, several Apollo astronauts gathered
here at Kennedy Space Center to remember the event _ including
Ohioan Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, almost as famous for his intense privacy as his
historic first lunar footstep, even joined an afternoon press
conference with three Apollo comrades _ Buzz Aldrin, who landed on
the moon with him and was the second man to walk on the moon; Gene
Cernan, who commanded the last lunar mission in December 1972 and
was the last Apollo astronaut on the moon; and Walter Cunningham,
who checked out the lunar module in earth orbit on the first manned
Apollo flight.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's privacy has become legendary in the three decades
since he stepped off the landing pad of the lunar module Eagle and
declared, ``That's one small step for man, one giant leap for
mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the news conference, asked if he would trade his historic
achievement for more privacy, Armstrong said, ``Never.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has long frustrated the news media for his extreme
reluctance to grant interviews. But Cernan chided the throng of
reporters for resenting Armstrong's privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just like to say, you know, it could have been anyone
who walked on the moon. ... But I can't think of anyone _ anyone _
who having had that opportunity could have handled it with as much
grace and as honor and dignity as Neil Armstrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of his colleagues, and to the disappointment of many
space-exploration advocates, Armstrong has never been a strong
public lobbyist for returning to the moon or sending people to
Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a compelling reason for society to go back to the
moon. That case will not be made by anyone here,'' but by
scientists, Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   He said America is still making giant leaps in space
exploration, including the International Space Station. He added,
``If I picked one that was important to me, it would be going to
Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts were in town for a gala anniversary dinner that
included an estimated 1,000 NASA employees and contractors who
worked on the program, and took part in a host of other activities
that will run through Tuesday, the 30th anniversary of the first
moon landing.
</P>
<P>
   The ground here shook at 9:32 a.m. on July 16, 1969, as a
towering Saturn V rocket rose majestically skyward with the Apollo
11 space vehicles perched atop it.
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, Armstrong and Aldrin landed the lunar module
Eagle on the Sea of Tranquility while Michael Collins waited in the
orbiting command module Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later, the pioneering astronauts and their
achievements still drew world attention.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said the enduring interest has been ``a pleasant
surprise,'' but Aldrin said the juxtaposition of the anniversary
with the end of the millennium has combined to heighten interest
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham said Americans old enough to remember the flight of
Apollo 11 look back for a particular feeling it gave them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think back to that feeling you had that Americans could do
anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner was held in NASA's Saturn V Center, where tables were
set under a mighty Saturn V rocket just like the ones that hurled
humans to another world.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles to the east, space shuttle Columbia stood poised to
light the night sky just after midnight on Tuesday when it roars
off its launch pad to deliver the Chandra X-ray space observatory
into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   In marked contrast to the male-dominated Apollo era, Columbia's
five-person crew will be commanded by a woman, Air Force Col.
Eileen Collins. Another woman, former Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base research chemist Lt. Col. Catherine G. ``Cady'' Coleman, is a
mission specialist making her second shuttle flight.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong expressed no doubts about Collins' ability to do the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``From everything I've heard, Eileen Collins is a very well
qualified and very able commander,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In his early life, Rabbi Geoffrey Dennis felt God's presence
following him, just over his shoulder but out of immediate reach.
</P>
<P>
   God followed Dennis through his Protestant childhood _ one
influenced by a mother whose charity, spirituality and
understanding of the Bible modeled for him the characteristics of a
religious life.
</P>
<P>
   God was seated over his shoulder when Dennis, as a teen, needled
the pastor of the Lutheran church his family attended with tough
questions during Confirmation class.
</P>
<P>
   But God was also out of immediate reach as Dennis contemplated
the story of Jesus in Gethsemane, as depicted in church
stained-glass windows, and pondered why his suffering was
considered different from the suffering of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit that right from the very beginning, I felt a
certain disconnect with the church,'' Dennis said. ``It was
difficult to find my connection to God through Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Dennis said, he found a connection to God at a local
synagogue, a discovery that marked an end of years of searching and
led him to convert from Christianity to Judaism when he was 23.
</P>
<P>
   The transition placed Dennis, 39, in an emerging group of
Americans who leave the faiths of their families to find a new
spiritual home among a variety of religious traditions imported to
a predominantly Christian United States by generations of
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   For many who change faiths, this process is a journey to a new
spirituality, community and culture. Dennis, who this month became
the first full-time rabbi at Congregation Kol Ami in Flower Mound,
a Dallas suburb, is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   He looked, for example, to Sikhs, Taoists, Buddhists and
American Indian religions before finding a glimmer of a connection
after reading a book on Judaism while in college. The connection
was really ignited later, as Dennis plowed through the stacks at
the temple library at Congregation Albert in his hometown of
Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had been a lost soul who found a place to come
home,'' Dennis said.
</P>
<P>
   Judaism's emphasis on moral responsibility and personal
accountability felt comfortable to him and also appealed to him
intellectually, an aspect of religion that wasn't communicated to
him in the churches he attended, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Judaism, God does not treat us like children,'' Dennis
said. ``He expects us to be adults and be responsible for our
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Jewish understanding of family and community
and their importance as the centerpiece of a person's life ``spoke
powerfully'' to him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America, we are so individualistic that we lose sight of
the fact that human beings are communal animals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After becoming what some call a Jew by choice, Dennis eventually
entered Hebrew Union College and committed himself to a life of
teaching and leading a Jewish community. He spent three years as an
assistant rabbi in Indianapolis before taking the Flower Mound
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious that his process of conversion was more than
just a matter of fact, an element to fill some sort of
requirement,'' said Rabbi Paul J. Citrin, who was a mentor for
Dennis at Congregation Albert, where Dennis converted. ``He got
into it very personally and very deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis described converting to Judaism as a gradual process of
explanation, study and understanding. It does not come thundering
down as a revelation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, scholars of Judaism have argued about whether the faith
really accepts converts, said Egon Mayer, director of the Jewish
Outreach Institute at the Graduate School of the City University of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, Judaism is not a conversionary faith,'' Mayer
said. ``It has never sought converts, certainly not in the past
2,000 years. But that tradition has begun to change in a curious
way since about 1979. The principal reason is interfaith
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, a survey showed that up to 5 percent of American Jews
were Jews by choice, and the trend appears to be continuing, Mayer
said.
</P>
<P>
   But conversion is hardly a door-to-door enterprise for Jewish
congregations. Instead, it is part of the tradition that starts in
a way that would make the average evangelical blanch. The Talmud
specifically states that a rabbi's first obligation when talking
with someone who wishes to convert is to discourage the person.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis says he responds to potential converts by encouraging
them to first take a six-month class in which they read Jewish
texts. The study is also a time to let the passion cool and allow
reason and discovery of faith to set in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Judaism prefers its converts to come with a
reflective, informed consent,'' Dennis said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the lack of evangelistic ardor is that Jews believe
anyone can have a relationship with God, Dennis said, and
membership in a synagogue is not a requirement to know God.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Judaism, there is no need to make people Jewish,'' Dennis
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Talmud offers a five-part conversion process that follows a
formal discouragement with extensive education. Next, a Beit Din, a
community of at least three members, gathers to discuss Judaism and
witness the conversion. Then males are circumcised or are asked to
offer a ceremonial drop of blood. Lastly, the convert is immersed
in a bath, Dennis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baptism _ they got it from us,'' he said, referring to the
Christian initiation ritual.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of conversionary zeal also has a cultural side.
Converting to Judaism is taking on a community that has known
persecution but also enjoys a rich history and close bonds. Most
Jewish rituals are practiced in the home, and many require the
participation of other Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The family of Dennis' wife, Robin, helped to enrich his
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a cultural peace that comes with being Jewish that
one needs to learn,'' Dennis said. ``I had a very involved Jewish
family to be my mentors. They made my entree into Jewish life very
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since coverting to Judaism, Dennis says, God is not over his
shoulder, behind him or out of his reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the place where I felt I was speaking to God face to
face,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leaders of both parties said Friday that the House
is prepared to cut off money to finance the Air Force's $70-billion
F-22 fighter program, a highly unusual decision that has stunned
the Pentagon and military contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The stage for a full House vote next week was set Friday when
the House Appropriations Committee unanimously approved a
$268-billion Pentagon spending bill denying the Air Force the $1.8
billion it sought to finance the first six F-22s. The cutoff is
supported by Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and key Republican leaders who say the
fledgling fighter is simply too expensive to build at about $200
million a plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to concentrate on those things that work,'' Hastert
said.
</P>
<P>
   The move against the F-22 came from some of the most
military-minded senior Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., who is chairman of the Appropriations
Committee and a long-time champion of the F-22, said Friday in an
interview, ``The Air Force's money and everything in the Air
Force's mind is focused on the F-22.''
</P>
<P>
   But Young, who in 29 years in Congress has been a stalwart
advocate of defense spending, said the Air Force needs well-paid
pilots, spare parts and refurbished jets more than it needs the
F-22.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to fix it,'' he said of the Air Force. ``Now, can we
fix it if we put all our money into one basket? No, we can't. It
would be far better to stop, take a look at where we are, and to
make a decision that will last into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon reacted fiercely. ``This decision, if enacted,
would for all practical purposes kill the F-22 program, the
cornerstone of our nation's global air power in the 21st century,''
Defense Secretary William Cohen said Friday in a letter to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing quite like this has happened in decades, according to
senior members of Congress and veterans of Pentagon spending wars.
Congress almost never kills major weapons systems that are about to
reach the assembly line. And the F-22 is the biggest Air Force
weapons program of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a remarkable occurrence, one of the rarest
imaginable,'' said Dale Bumpers, who retired from the Senate in
1998 after 24 years, and now heads the Center for Defense
Information in Washington. ``I'm absolutely amazed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force wanted to buy the first F-22 fighter jets this
year, even though its flight tests have barely begun, its on-board
computers are not ready and its cost has grown to $200 million
apiece, roughly four times the cost of the F-15, the plane it was
intended to replace.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee tried to cut off funds for
the F-22 10 years ago, calling it a financial disaster waiting to
happen. But that was when the plane was in the early stages of
research and development, not on the verge of full production.
About $20 billion has been spent on research and development since
the plane was first proposed in 1981, and two test models have been
built.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon and Congress occasionally scuttle planes, bombs and
missiles on the drawing board, or choose to build fewer weapons
than originally planned once production has started. But very
rarely, if ever, do they block the initial production of a major
weapons system deemed ready to build.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the House tried to kill funds for the B-2 bomber, but
the bill was defeated on the floor. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
killed another Air Force program, the A-12, in the research and
development phase in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The move to kill the F-22 has flabbergasted the Air Force, the
Pentagon and military contractors, who were expecting widespread
congressional support for significant military spending increases
after the war in Yugoslavia. They are already heavily lobbying
senators to countermand the House's move when the military spending
bill comes to a House-Senate conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how they arrived at this specific
decision,'' said Bob Rearden, program manager for the F-22 at
Lockheed Martin, the military contracting giant that is to build
the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this happening? Money, senior House members said.
</P>
<P>
   The recently retired chairman of Lockheed Martin, Norman
Augustine, once predicted: ``In the year 2054, the entire defense
budget will purchase just one tactical aircraft.'' Maybe he wasn't
joking, Congress is now realizing.
</P>
<P>
   The $70-billion price tag on the F-22 program far exceeds this
year's entire budget of $53 billion for buying weapons and
represents roughly 25 percent of the annual cost of every
government agency outside the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   And the F-22 is only one of three different fighters the
Pentagon wants to buy for the four armed services. They would cost,
all told, $350 billion _ far more than the entire annual defense
budget.
</P>
<P>
   There may be more to the decision than money alone. It might
never have happened if Newt Gingrich were still the speaker,
members said. The plane is to be built in Marietta, Ga., in
Gingrich's old district.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And there are deeper issues involved, some of which may be
personal and political.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee's report on the proposed
Pentagon budget, released Friday, suggests that the Air Force may
have been less than forthcoming with Congress about the F-22's
costs and capabilities, and the urgency to build it.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force told Congress 10 years ago that it could build 750
F-22s for $67.5 billion. It now appears that a similar sum would
buy no more than 339 planes. The cost per plane has gone from $90
million to roughly $200 million, auditors say, and the Air Force
has understated the F-22's true cost by $9 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   The House report said there have been problems with the plane's
wings, brakes, fuselage, fuel lines and engines, and that its
on-board computer systems remain untested. Senior Air Force
officials acknowledged no technical problems with the F-22.
Rearden, of Lockheed Martin, said they have been fixed. ``There are
no show-stopping technical issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials said they face a threat from foreign
aircraft like the Russian MiG-29 that they cannot overcome without
the F-22. ``We can no longer guarantee that we'll be able to
dominate the sky,'' said Maj. Gen. Bruce Carlson, director of Air
Force operational requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee report said that, 10 years from now, ``the
United States will have a 5-to-1 numerical advantage of advanced
fighters against our most challenging adversaries without the
F-22.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee said the F-15, which the F-22 was supposed to
replace, has at least 15 or 20 years of life left in it, and that
the Joint Strike Fighter, which is being developed for the Air
Force, Navy and Marines, will be in service by then.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money's not there,'' said Rep. John Murtha of
Pennsylvania, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee.
``There's no threat like the Soviet threat hanging over us. The
time is right to stop this thing.''

MICROSOFT PREVAILS IN SUIT BY SOFTWARE MAKER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn.)   (See also MICROSOFT-WEALTH) 
(rk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a David versus Goliath case, a courtroom confrontation
between a struggling little software maker and the mighty Microsoft
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was accused of befriending the fledgling company when
it suited its interests and then callously casting the company
aside when it was no longer useful, denying it access to
Microsoft's technology on fair terms. The tactic, the plaintiff's
lawyers argued, was a violation of federal antitrust laws and all
but a death sentence for Bristol Technology Inc., of Danbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Friday, as an uptick in Microsoft's stock price lifted the
personal wealth of Bill Gates to nearly $100 billion, a Connecticut
jury of five men and three women, ranging in age from 21 to late
60s, whose job status ran the gamut from unemployed to corporate
executive, sided with Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   The jury in U.S. District Court in Bridgeport, Conn., found that
Microsoft had not violated antitrust laws in its dealings with
Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   The private suit in Connecticut has no direct impact on the
major antitrust challenge Microsoft faces _ the federal case
brought by the Justice Department and 19 states. The charges and
evidence are different.
</P>
<P>
   But antitrust experts said Friday's verdict would certainly
hearten the Microsoft legal team in Washington. Despite the
differences, Microsoft has been portrayed in both cases as an
overreaching monopolist who used its market power as a club _ a
characterization supported by piles of Microsoft e-mail and
internal documents that spoke forcefully of destroying rivals and
leaning on partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a decisive triumph for Microsoft, and it has to be
shot of adrenalin for the Microsoft lawyers working on the
government case,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at the George
Washington University law school. ``This verdict may not have any
direct effect on the government case, but it shows Microsoft that
it can win these cases, even when much of the evidence in court is
unflattering.''
</P>
<P>
   In celebrating their victory, the Microsoft lawyers certainly
echoed the same themes of the company's defense in the government
case _ that its business practices are merely the rough-and-tumble
of modern capitalism, and that the computer software market moves
so rapidly that Microsoft can scarcely be considered an entrenched
monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The considered opinion of the community in which Bristol
operates is that Microsoft did nothing wrong,'' said David Tulchin,
a partner at Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell who was Microsoft's lead trial
lawyer. ``All that Microsoft did was compete hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Aeschbacher, a senior corporate lawyer at Microsoft, said
that the verdict strongly suggested that the jury was ``impressed
by all the evidence in the record of the intensity and dynamism of
competition in the software industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol had sought a stiff financial penalty against Microsoft _
damages ranging from $130 million to $263 million, which, if
Microsoft was found to violate antitrust laws, would be tripled.
</P>
<P>
   The jury did find that Microsoft had violated a Connecticut law
prohibiting ``deceptive practices,'' like making misleading
statements to a business partner. But for that unspecified
transgression, the jury awarded Bristol a mere $1.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not even a parking ticket,'' observed Kovacic of George
Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   Not even that for Microsoft, which has nearly $22 billion in
cash on hand, according to its most recent financial statement.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol said it disappointed by the outcome and that it was
``exploring'' the option of appealing the verdict. ``We still
firmly believe that Microsoft engaged in anti-competitive behavior
against Bristol,'' said Keith Blackwell, the chief executive of
Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Lynch, a partner at O'Melvany &AMP; Myers and lead counsel
for Bristol, said: ``This is a case of great importance to the
entire computer industry. While the ruling is disappointing to
Bristol, this is an issue that is not going to go away. Microsoft's
abuse of its dominant position has to be addressed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, antitrust experts say the Bristol suit was a high-risk
legal case from the outset. First, they say, the case focused on
the software markets for computer work stations and so-called
server computers, which feed data out to desktop machines in
computer networks. In those markets, Microsoft is not nearly as
dominant as it is in the market for desktop operating systems for
personal computers, where its Windows software runs more than 90
percent of PCs sold.
</P>
<P>
   Second, antitrust experts note that Bristol relied on the
antitrust theory that Microsoft had a ``duty to deal'' with
Bristol. And the experts point out that duty-to-deal cases, which
regard the plaintiff almost as a regulated utility, have been
difficult to win in recent years. The main exceptions, they note,
have been in industries with traditions of regulation, like
telecommunications, or businesses involving natural assets, like
ski slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, for its sweeping antitrust case, the government
did depose Blackwell of Bristol. But the Justice Department chose
to focus instead on Microsoft's use of its market power derived
from its dominance of the PC operating system market. The
government has charged that the company used its Windows monopoly
to stifle competition from the rise of Internet software. And the
government also steered clear of any duty-to-deal claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bristol chose to bring a case in one of the most pro-defendant
areas of antitrust,'' said Robert E. Hall, a professor at Stanford
University. ``Courts have been very reluctant to say that companies
must share their intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol makes software that allows programs written for
Microsoft's Windows to run on work stations or servers that use
Unix, an industrial-strength operating system popular among
corporate users. In 1994, when Microsoft was still having trouble
cracking into the market for corporate computing, it signed a
three-year licensing deal with Bristol. It allowed Bristol broad
access to Microsoft's Windows technology.
</P>
<P>
   But three years later, when Microsoft's own powerful operating
system, Windows NT, was making strong inroads into the corporate
market, the deal offered to Bristol was very different. Microsoft
wanted corporate customers to switch from Unix to Windows NT, and
Bristol alleged that its ``translation'' software _ once an asset
for Microsoft _ was now seen by Microsoft as a potential impediment
to the migration of customers to Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   So when renegotiating the contract, Microsoft offered Bristol a
new license, but at four times the price and with far less access
to Microsoft technology. ``Microsoft's dealings with Bristol are a
classic bait-and-switch,'' Lynch, the Bristol lawyer, asserted
before the trial began in June.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft did not deny that its license terms had changed, but
it explained that was because the market conditions changed.
Besides, Microsoft says that another company, Mainsoft Inc.,
accepted the same terms that were offered to Bristol. Microsoft
argued that Bristol was trying to elevate a garden-variety contract
dispute into an antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Inc. magazine ranked Bristol 140th among the 500
fastest-growing companies in the nation, with a payroll of 70
people and estimated revenues of $8 million. But the failure to
renew its Microsoft license has placed Bristol's future in doubt,
and it has spent heavily on its suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bristol's mistake was that it chose to litigate instead of
negotiate,'' said Aeschbacher of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The jury in Connecticut agreed.

 &HT;    Mission is giant step for women
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ NASA will be launching more than a space shuttle
when it sends Eileen Collins into orbit Tuesday to command her
first space mission.
</P>
<P>
   NASA Administrator Dan Goldin said Friday he has directed NASA
to work closely with a locally based organization to encourage more
women to take up aviation or technical careers.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Baty, president of Women in Aviation International Inc.,
met with Goldin in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday to discuss a
``partnership'' with NASA to prepare educational materials that
members will distribute in school programs around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Baty runs the organization from her home and private airstrip in
West Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said the partnership was an idea he put to Women in
Aviation last march when he spoke at their annual convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I challenged them to have each one of them spend an hour a
week going to schools around the country to talk to students,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin called the lack of scientists and engineers in America
``a national problem,'' but he said women represent a virtually
untapped pool of talent because they make up only a small
percentage of the professionals in those fields.
</P>
<P>
   Baty said she plans to attend the shuttle launch Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's historically significant because this is the first time a
woman has served as commander of a space shuttle mission,'' Baty
said. ``I think this will serve as an inspiration to young people,
particularly young women, to pursue careers in aviation and
aerospace.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, who will be making her third space shuttle flight, was
the first woman to be trained as a space shuttle pilot, and she has
been active in Women in Aviation since 1994, Baty said. Baty joined
Collins at the White House last year when First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton announced Collins' assignment as mission commander.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said he is still considering the idea of flying an
all-female space shuttle mission, but he said it's still under
review.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he doesn't want to offend some women astronauts by
proposing something that might be regarded as a political stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of women who fought hard to get into the
astronaut corps, and we don't want to demean their roles.''

QWEST'S DEAL   FOR U   S WEST   APPEARS SET  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Mass.)   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The board of U S West Inc., the smallest of the regional Bell
telephone companies, met Friday night to approve a merger with
Qwest Communications International Inc., the fast-growing
long-distance communications carrier, in a deal worth more than $30
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The companies could announce a deal as soon as this weekend,
according to executives close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   With this deal, a resolution of Qwest's battle against Global
Crossing Ltd., an undersea fiber-optic communications company, to
acquire U S West and Frontier Corp., the big long-distance carrier,
will probably begin to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Qwest, which characterized its previous two
offers for U S West as acquisitions, will instead call its deal
with U S West a merger of equals. U S West's previous deal to join
forces with Global Crossing had been called a merger of equals and
it appeared that U S West was not willing to step back from that
terminology in dealing with Qwest. Qwest and U S West will appoint
equal numbers of members to the combined company's board.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, it appears that Solomon D. Trujillo, U S
West's chairman, who had not been assured a substantial operational
role in the combined company under Qwest's earlier offers, will
become a member of a newly formed office of the chairman, to be led
by Joseph P. Nacchio, Qwest's chief executive. Nacchio and Trujillo
could also potentially share the title of chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But although Qwest appeared to make concessions on executive
leadership and structure, it did not appear that Qwest agreed to
raise its bid for U S West above its latest public offer of $69 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   U S West had earlier agreed to merge with Global Crossing for
$60 a share, plus a special $1 dividend for each U S West share.
After U S West announces a deal with Qwest, Global Crossing will
have five business days to make a counter-offer.
</P>
<P>
   But executives close to the talks said Friday that Qwest and
Global Crossing had struck a deal under which Global Crossing would
not contest Qwest's deal with U S West and Qwest would withdraw its
bid for Frontier. Global Crossing would also agree to a reduction
in the breakup fee it would be owed by U S West for backing out of
their original deal, to roughly $425 million from $850 million, and
part of it would be paid in the form of network services instead of
cash, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Global Crossing would acquire only Frontier, which
would give Global Crossing an advanced nationwide long-distance
communications network, an asset that at some level would seem to
mesh more easily with Global Crossing's undersea network than would
U S West's far-flung local systems. By splitting U S West and
Frontier, both Qwest and Global Crossing would be able to declare
victory. Global Crossing would gain a network in the United States,
and Qwest would gain millions of customers. U S West, which is
based in Denver, provides local telephone service in 14 western and
southwestern states.
</P>
<P>
   But while the swirl of deals seemed to include something new for
everyone _ except, perhaps, Frontier, which would not become the
subject of an even more prolonged bidding war) _ some
communications analysts were picking winners and losers Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big win for Qwest because it's proving that you can
acquire your way into local access,'' said Mark R. Bruneau,
president of the business strategy group at Renaissance Worldwide,
a consulting firm in Boston, ``and it's a big loss for Global
Crossing because it has a limited time to convert its lofty market
valuation into a real, sustainable revenue engine and operation.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the companies involved would comment.

<P>
   As companies plan to sell shares in their Internet operations to
the public, they face a quandary: whether to limit the potentially
huge stock benefits in the spinoff to the unit's employees or
managers, or to share the wealth throughout the company.
</P>
<P>
   The first solution helps keep the Internet staff from leaving to
join start-up companies that have their own stock benefits. The
second helps keep others in the company from feeling cheated _
especially if the Internet operation distributes work they created.
</P>
<P>
   Experts and consultants generally advise companies to
concentrate on attracting and keeping the best Internet managers,
instead of worrying about perceptions of fairness. In practice,
though, companies facing the decision often try to keep everybody
at least a little happy.
</P>
<P>
   Many public companies are considering Internet spinoffs _
usually selling only a portion of the shares to the public _
because of investors' passion for these issues.
</P>
<P>
   When about 18 percent of Barnesandnoble.com, owned by Barnes &AMP;
Noble and Bertelsmann AG, was sold to the public in May, Barnes &AMP;
Noble employees who already owned stock through an existing
benefits plan had the opportunity to buy the spinoff's shares at
the offering price of $18. (It closed on Friday at $19.1875.)
</P>
<P>
   As part of their compensation, many employees of
Barnesandnoble.com have received stock options over the last two
years for as little as a quarter of the offering price. But like
parents trying to discourage jealousies among children, Barnes &AMP;
Noble executives vigorously discouraged comparisons of the benefits
their employees received.
</P>
<P>
   The privately held Bertelsmann, one of the world's largest media
companies, decided not to give its employees a similar plan for
Barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   But apart from the spinoff, Bertelsmann decided this month to
give 550 senior managers throughout the company ``virtual shares,''
redeemable for cash in five years. Eighty percent of the shares'
value will depend on performance of the managers' own operations;
the remainder will depend on performance of the whole company,
including gains in value from future spinoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Engstrom, president of Random House Inc., a Bertelsmann
unit, is one of the plan's designers and participants. He called it
an improvement over a previous plan that offered the parent
company's managers no rewards for a spinoff's success. Now, he
said, ``people who had no ability to participate can.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other companies _ media concerns in particular _ are
facing or are likely to face similar questions over how to share
the Web's wealth. Among them is Walt Disney. It announced on
Tuesday that it would create a single business, Go.com, combining
its Internet holdings with Infoseek, the search service.
</P>
<P>
   Shares tracking the performance of Go.com could then be used to
make acquisitions or to attract Internet managers, whom Disney has
had trouble keeping. Disney has not decided how it will distribute
stock benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said last week that it was looking at issuing shares
that track its Internet operations, and Forbes Inc. is exploring
the possibility of an initial public offering of Forbes.com. One
person at Forbes, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
employees have been told informally that they would share the
benefits. ``Everyone at Forbes has contributed to the success of
Forbes.com, and that fact will be reflected were an offering to
occur,'' this person said.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation consultants say that large, established companies
too concerned about fairness will be at a disadvantage relative to
independent Internet start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``If companies set out to prevent hurt feelings, then they will
fail to create a rich-enough package to attract top-notch talent,''
said David R. Brodwin, a compensation specialist for Andersen
Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Middelhoff, chairman and chief executive of Bertelsmann,
does not see those goals as mutually exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann, with projected revenues of $18.5 billion this year,
has operations including Bantam Doubleday Dell, RCA Records, Arista
Records and Family Circle and McCall's magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Middlehoff said he hoped to take as many as five Internet
divisions public in the next three years. He has cited
Springer-Verlag, which publishes technical and medical journals on
paper and on line, as a likely spinoff candidate, with plans to
expand its Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   Internet spinoffs are essential to the company, he said, because
the parent, long privately held, has no proceeds from an offering
of its own with which to make acquisitions or reward employees.
</P>
<P>
   Middelhoff added that the plan for virtual shares was in keeping
with the company's philosophy of high salaries and fairness. And,
he said, he wants to avoid creating two manager classes: the
wealthy and the disgruntled: ``As Bertelsmann is split into two
elements _ the core business and the Internet start-ups _ we are
asking, `What does it mean for executives who work for the core
business?'''

LENDERS REGARD MEXICAN ECONOMY WITH SUSPICION
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico's stock market and economic statistics are
among the healthiest in Latin America. But the failure of two major
companies to meet debt payments this week focused attention on the
plight of scores of other heavily indebted businesses, marooned
without credit by the country's four-year banking crisis.
</P>
<P>
   One of Mexico's largest construction companies, Bufete
Industrial SA, announced that it could not meet a $100 million debt
payment that had been due on Thursday. Grupo Dina, the country's
largest bus and truck manufacturer, missed a $6.6 million bond
payment the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's largest steel maker and its other two largest
industrial builders have also either defaulted on debt payments or
announced major losses in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the developments illustrated how Mexico's economy
was increasingly divided into a robust sector of elite companies
that have free access to foreign credit and scores of lesser ones
that can attract capital only at disadvantageous terms or are cut
off altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The string of defaults here this year could make the financial
challenge faced by most Mexican companies even more formidable as
foreign lenders look with increased suspicion at the Mexican
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telmex, Cemex, Alfa, Televisa, huge companies like that are
really special cases because they have long histories of dealing
with foreign banks, and have no problem getting foreign credit,''
said Pedro Javier Gonzalez, an economist at Mexico City's Institute
of Political Studies. ``But there are dozens of businesses in good
condition that will have more difficulty getting credit because of
the reputation Mexico now has for defaults.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's economy grew by 4.8 percent in 1998 and is expected to
grow perhaps 3 percent this year, showing more robust strength than
any other major Latin economy. The Mexican stock market's main
index is up nearly 58 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the banking and construction sectors still have not
recovered from the 1994 peso crisis, said Damian Fraser, head of
Mexico research at Warburg Dillon Read.
</P>
<P>
   The government has spent $65 billion since 1995 to clean up 13
collapsed banks, and last month authorities announced that they
would have to inject huge new sums into two more, Grupo Financiero
Serfin SA and Bancrecer SA, to restore their solvency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet credit has fallen every year, and there's still no sign of
recovery by the banks,'' Fraser said. ``Construction companies,
which need to borrow heavily to finance projects, have been hit
hard by the lack of credit, by a squeeze in public sector
investment and by foreign competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Grupo Tribasa SA, the country's second-largest builder, missed a
$26 million payment on a $150 million bond in March. Over the weeks
since, Tribasa has sought to restructure its debts by selling
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Altos Hornos de Mexico SA, the country's largest steel
manufacturer, announced that it had missed a $39 million loan
payment. The company, burdened by $1.8 billion in debt and plunging
steel prices, is negotiating a merger with a Monterrey
conglomerate, Grupo Imsa.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Bufete Industrial announced that it would seek to
restructure $140 million in short-term debt, but on Wednesday it
announced that it could not meet a $100 million Eurobond payment
due on Thursday. The company specializes in building oil rigs and
electric power stations, and one of its biggest customers, the
state-owned electricity generating company, CFE, has been short of
cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oil prices have been low, and the government has cut the
budgets of Pemex and the CFE, Bufete's biggest clients,'' said
Sobani Warner, a construction industry analyst at Bear Stearns in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Grupo Dina, the bus and truck manufacturer, also has been
attempting to restructure a crushing debt load. In June it sold a
61 percent stake in MCII Holdings, a motor coach company based in
Des Plaines, Ill., raising $125 million.
</P>
<P>
   The string of missed payments is aggravating nervousness among
foreign lenders about the solvency of all but the largest Mexican
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's having trouble getting foreign credit now, and
weaker companies really may have trouble financing,'' said Victor
Manuel Herrera, a managing director of Standard &AMP; Poor's in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there are defaults, it affects the image of the
country,'' he said. ``Healthier companies will have to convince
investors and banks that there's no generalized problem in
Mexico.''

GIVE WOMEN A SPORTING CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I think I played kickball once.
</P>
<P>
   As I understand it, that isn't exactly the same as soccer, but
it's the closest I'll ever get to the game that put America on top
of the world this month.
</P>
<P>
   And you might say it's as close as I'll ever get to being an
athlete. I think I was OK with that until the U.S. women's soccer
team defeated China to win the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls rule! Boys drool! Soccer's cool,'' the chant went.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't cared much for sports since I stopped drooling for
Jimmy Carstafnur and stopped cheering for the McComb High School
Tigers back in 1975. But while watching the replays and the
jubilation surrounding the U.S. team's victory, I had this sudden
urge to play a sport, to be part of a winning team.
</P>
<P>
   I think I played softball once. What I remember most is that no
one wanted me on their team.
</P>
<P>
   Briana Scurry. Brandi Chastain. Sunday, I was one of them,
albeit much older and with a lot less athletic talent. They and
their teammates are America's new female role models and heroes.
There are even two 31-year-old mothers on the team, real soccer
moms. We've come a long way. Or have we?
</P>
<P>
   You think so until something like this happens, and you're
reminded of how slowly the clock ticks for us. Women's sports still
get less news coverage and female professional athletes (and, I
might add, women in general) still make less money than their male
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   A news story said that these pioneers, for instance, will make
less for winning the World Cup (a $12,500 bonus) than Los Angeles
Dodgers pitcher Kevin Brown gets for retiring one batter.
</P>
<P>
   And at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, women's soccer was deemed not
ready for prime-time television. The United States defeated China
2-1 before 76,000 to win the medal, but NBC aired only 10 minutes
of previously taped highlights.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't the sort of thing you want to read about if you're a
mother of two little girls. Not in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, you soothe yourself with the gains that have been made.
The triumphant women in the photographs, smiling at you from the TV
screen, that's you and what you might become.
</P>
<P>
   That's your hope for your little girls. If you have lived long
enough, though, you know from experience that some doors are still
shut because of gender. Because it happened to you, someone will
look at them, and whether they say it or not, decide that a man
needs the job more because he's got a family to support.
</P>
<P>
   A guy told me once to ``stop b-------.'' Funny, we still live in
a world where men offer ``constructive criticism,'' but a woman is
called a complainer or worse for doing the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   When I got off a plane from Seattle and saw Scurry and Chastain
and their teammates on the front page of this newspaper, for a
brief moment thought I might be dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   I can't play soccer, but maybe my daughters will one day. Maybe
they'll be paid the same respect, the same dollars as men. Maybe
one day I can imagine people opening ALL the world's doors to them,
as a mother imagines for her sons.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe one day I won't have to dream. It'll just be.

   France: Libya Pays $31 Million for Bombing Plane &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Libya has transferred $31 million to France to compensate
families of the 171 people killed when a French airliner was blown
up over the African desert in 1989, officials said. A French court
that convicted six high-ranking Libyan officials in absentia this

occurred at a time of tension between the two countries over Chad.
The French Foreign Ministry said the payment was acknowledgment by

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, July 18, will move Saturday in the `a' category. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SUPERPOWER-REVIEW _ It is hard to pinpoint the moment when
America's successes in the 1990s moved from a subject of grudging
admiration in capitals around the world, to a source of annoyance
at Washington's triumphal-sounding pronouncements, to a cause of
real apprehension. But surely the capstone came with Kosovo.
Intentionally or not it demonstrated to allies and potential
adversaries alike how the Americans had exploited new military
technologies since the Gulf War. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-BARAK-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ Ehud Barak, the new prime
minister of Israel, is determined to be the great peacemaker of his
country's history, to resolve century-old conflicts once and for
all. But the former general does not spout a vision that could even
remotely be considered utopian. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-REVIEW (Tehran, Iran) _ Things are not always what they
seem in this country of high walls and black veils. Invasions,
occupations, foreign meddling and arbitrary rule over the centuries
have scarred the collective memory of the Iranian people and taught
them keys to survival: improvisation, role-playing and even
deception. By Elaine Sciolino.
</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN-CHINA-REVIEW (Beijing) _ Here's a riddle: How do you make
a country richer and more democratic and at the same time
outmaneuver a huge, luggish neighbor that wants to ``reunify'' with
you? Here's an answer (and Beijing won't like this): ask the
president of Taiwan, Lee Teng-hui. By Seth Faison.

   KOSOVO-REVIEW (Srebrenica, Bosnia-Herzegovina) _ Four years ago
this month, Bosnian Serb soldiers hunted down and killed as many as
7,000 mostly unarmed Muslim men in the rugged hills surrounding
Srebrenica, a town the United Nations declared a ``safe area'' and
vowed to protect. Since the war ended in 1995, local Serb
nationalists have used tactics ranging from endless negotiations to
rock-throwing mobs to prevent the town council from meeting. But in
a scene difficult to imagine only a few months ago, two dozen
Muslim politicians calmly sat down with 20 of their Serb
counterparts in the lobby of a local hotel on June 29 and held the
inaugural session of the town council of what they called the ``new
Srebrenica.'' By David Rohde.

<P>
   EMBASSY-CLOSINGS-REVIEW (Washington) _ The closing of American
embassies, those flag-flying symbols of American power and
influence, was once about as common as a snowstorm on the
palm-shaded beaches of Madagascar. But in the year since terrorist
bombs destroyed American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, 67
American embassies and consulates have been closed for some period
of time for security reasons. By Philip Shenon.
</P>
<P>
   RECYCLED-TV-REVIEW _ These days, it's no longer a question of
which television shows, no matter how crummy, become movies. The
question now is which ones don't. And the answer, increasingly, is
precious few. By Thomas Vinciguerra.
</P>
<P>
   PUNITIVE-DAMAGES-REVIEW _ Sending messages is the purpose of
punitive damages, defined by law as punishment for especially
outrageous conduct. But do juries go too far? By William Glaberson.
</P>
<P>
   AIRLINE-SAFETY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Pleas for justice are
routine after an airplane crash, and they are generally played out
in civil courts, where survivors and relatives of victims sue for
damages. But last week, in a surprising move, prosecutors won
criminal indictments against a maintenance company, two mechanics
and a superior in the crash of a Valujet plane in the Everglades in
1996. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-CARE-REVIEW (Washington) _ After listening to the
rancorous debate in the Senate over health-care reform last week,
it would seem obvious that differences between Democrats and
Republicans are profound. But removed from the context of
election-year politics, combatants on both sides make it clear
there is plenty of room to compromise on a way to give Americans
some protection from health-care plans that wrongly skimp on
coverage. By Michael Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-BILLBOARDS-REVIEW _ Whether it rains or freezes, and
even if you don't have a plastic Jesus on the dashboard of your
car, you might have a hard time avoiding reminders of the Lord on
highways across the country this summer. Since last fall,
billboards and signs bearing specific messages have appeared on
roads in some 40 states from Alaska to Texas. But not everyone's
ecstatic. By Tom Kuntz.

<P>
   SUPERPOWER-REVIEW _ It is hard to pinpoint the moment when
America's successes in the 1990s moved from a subject of grudging
admiration in capitals around the world, to a source of annoyance
at Washington's triumphal-sounding pronouncements, to a cause of
real apprehension. But surely the capstone came with Kosovo.
Intentionally or not it demonstrated to allies and potential
adversaries alike how the Americans had exploited new military
technologies since the Gulf War. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-BARAK-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ Ehud Barak, the new prime
minister of Israel, is determined to be the great peacemaker of his
country's history, to resolve century-old conflicts once and for
all. But the former general does not spout a vision that could even
remotely be considered utopian. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-REVIEW (Tehran, Iran) _ Things are not always what they
seem in this country of high walls and black veils. Invasions,
occupations, foreign meddling and arbitrary rule over the centuries
have scarred the collective memory of the Iranian people and taught
them keys to survival: improvisation, role-playing and even
deception. By Elaine Sciolino.
</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN-CHINA-REVIEW (Beijing) _ Here's a riddle: How do you make
a country richer and more democratic and at the same time
outmaneuver a huge, luggish neighbor that wants to ``reunify'' with
you? Here's an answer (and Beijing won't like this): ask the
president of Taiwan, Lee Teng-hui. By Seth Faison.

 &HT;    Y2K status of key services uncertain
 &HT;    By Julie B. Hairston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A summary of 8,000 reports to the state on the readiness of
computer systems for the next millennium appears to raise concern
about such critical institutions as hospitals and law enforcement
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. Roy Barnes and state officials who reviewed the summary
report Friday expressed confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable enough in this process that I'm not digging a
bomb shelter out at the Governor's Mansion and stocking it with
water and rice cakes,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Only a third of police, fire and 911 units statewide returned
the surveys. Gary McConnell, director of the Georgia Emergency
Management Agency, said he is meeting with police chiefs and
deputies around the state about their Y2K readiness. He predicted
that by Sept. 15, when the next report is issued, the response rate
will be between 80 percent and 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals had a high response rate, but almost a third of those
responding received red, or ``danger,'' scores, while less than 4
percent received green, or ``ready,'' scores. The Georgia Hospital
Association is working with its members to improve the outlook,
according to Executive Director Joseph Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the green range were most water systems, electric
companies and telephone systems.
</P>
<P>
   The State of Georgia Citizens' Y2K Task Force, appointed by the
governor, sent 8,000 surveys to organizations in 29 categories
statewide, including emergency services, law enforcement agencies,
utilities and pollution control plants. The surveys asked how much
progress had been made toward dealing with the ``Y2K bug.''
</P>
<P>
   Some computers and computer programs are designed only to
recognize the last two digits of the year. So, when the year 2000
clicks in, they will recognize it as 1900. This could cause
computer problems ranging from miscalculations to complete
shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said Georgia is unique among states in its effort to
compile, analyze and disseminate comprehensive data on the state of
Y2K preparations for essential services.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys are intended to determine what local governments and
utilities are doing to prevent the Y2K bug from interrupting
essential services, including hospitals; police and fire
departments; power, gas and water companies; and water and
wastewater departments. ``If you're not ready for Y2K, or if you
did not respond to this survey, so that we can make sure that
you're ready, it is time to get to work,'' Barnes said. ``The
people of Georgia are going to hold all 8,000 of these entities
accountable on January the first.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said the task force will issue two more reports before
the end of 1999 and agencies that refuse to respond may be subject
to legal sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The worst response rate was among police and fire departments.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes speculated law enforcement officials may have been too
busy to worry about filling out the survey. ``I don't think it's a
matter of intent,'' he said. ``It's just a matter of priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's police, fire and 911 agencies were all rated in the
red, as were Gwinnett County's police and 911 departments.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities not only had a high response rate, but most,
particularly the state's largest electric and telephone companies,
reported they are either Y2K compliant or soon will be.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals, heavily laden with high-tech equipment, are working
feverishly to become Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very confident that we are on track for our target date
of Sept. 30, `` said Pat Bowers, communications director for
Atlanta's Northside Hospital. ``We're taking care of people's
lives, so we're making sure we're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Information from the surveys has been posted on a Web site at
www.year2000ga.org ``so that all citizens of this state can hold
their providers of essential services responsible and accountable
for where they stand in regard to Y2K,'' Barnes said. Barnes said
overall he is comfortable with the level of Y2K readiness _ and
plans to spend New Year's Eve in Georgia.

GATES HITS $100 BILLION MARK, MORE OR LESS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass., Wash.)  (See also MICROSOFT-VERDICT) 
(rk) 
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month, in the largest gift ever by a living person to a
charitable foundation, Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft Corp.,
donated $5 billion to support education and health care causes.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, in a few hours of stock market trading, Gates' holdings
surged by just about that amount, brushing $100 billion for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   The mixture of awe and dismay that has long characterized
America's fixation on Gates' personal wealth was perhaps best
summed up Friday by Vincent Malgapo, a contributor to the Silicon
Investor electronic discussion forums: ``Bill Gates MSFT stock
worth $100 Billion right now!'' read the comment, which was posted
at 11:41 a.m. ``WOW!''
</P>
<P>
   Gates, who owns 19.4 percent, or about 1 billion shares, of the
company he co-founded in 1975, owes his world record to the
remarkable performance of Microsoft's stock. Shares of the software
company climbed 5.4 percent Friday to a record high of $99.4375, on
expectations that it will establish a separate tracking stock for
its Internet properties.
</P>
<P>
   The company is the first to top $500 billion in market value. If
it were a country it would have the ninth-largest economy in the
world, behind Spain, which has a gross domestic product of $553
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the ballooning of Microsoft's stock price simply does not
hold the same fascination as that of its chairman's brokerage
account.
</P>
<P>
   ``He finally did it,'' said Paul Saffo, director of the
Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif. ``This is what we've
all been waiting for. How much interest do you suppose it
generates? I bet it's a 747 per day.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Greenspun, creator of the Bill Gates Personal Wealth
Clock, a Web site that continuously calculates the value of Gates'
Microsoft stock, had a more pointed speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this will convince my students they shouldn't work so
hard to become rich,'' said Greenspun, a researcher at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's laboratory for computer
science. ``Because they're probably not going to be richer than
Bill Gates, so they might as well do something interesting and
valuable to society instead.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time of sustained economic prosperity, America's proclivity
to celebrate wealth is reflected in the high marks Gates still
receives in national opinion polls. And the 43-year-old executive,
who lives in a $60 million mansion on the shores of Lake Washington
with his wife and two children, has recently begun to contribute
more to philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   But the $100 billion mark may also mark a change in popular
perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gates has crossed a psychological marker, and it's going to
increase pressure on him to recycle more and more of that money
through his foundations,'' said Ron Chernow, an economic historian.
``There will be more attention focused on the extraordinarily
lopsided distribution of wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Gates is not the only software entrepreneur to become
fabulously wealthy in recent years. Microsoft's co-founder, Paul
Allen, and its chief executive, Steve Ballmer, are among the
world's five richest people, along with investor Warren E. Buffett,
whose 39.9 percent stake in the investment holding company
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is valued at about $42.5 billion, making
him second to Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of founders of fledgling Internet companies have become
worth millions on paper in a matter of months.
</P>
<P>
   And by some calculations, Gates is less wealthy than John D.
Rockefeller, who had in excess of 2 percent of the gross national
product at the peak of his wealth in 1913.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it may not be long before Gates passes another milestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is when he reaches a trillion,'' said Lewis D'vorkin,
an executive editor at Forbes magazine, which publishes an annual
list of the world's 400 richest people. ``If Microsoft share price
grows in the next five years as fast as it has in the last five, he
hits the big one in 2004.''

SUSPECT DOES NOT BELIEVE TEXAS LAWMEN `BETRAYED' HIM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By STEVE BREWER 
and MARIA LUISA PEREZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Mexican authorities said Friday that accused serial
killer Angel Maturino Resendez told them he did not feel Texas
law-enforcement officials had ``betrayed'' him by not ruling out
the death penalty in return for his surrender.
</P>
<P>
   He said, rather, that he had been promised `humanitarian'
treatment and did not believe that includes the death penalty, said
Marco Dosal, press attache for the Mexican Consulate in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendez's brother told reporters Thursday that the
family felt the officers who arranged the surrender had
``betrayed'' them by not taking the death penalty off the table.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Consul Jose Mendoza Caamano and Federico Guerra from the
consul's protection office met with Maturnio Resendez and his
attorney, Allen Turner, for two hours Friday in the Harris County
jail in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendez, a 39-year-old Mexican citizen previously
known as Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, is charged in Harris County with
the burglary of the home of Dr. Claudia Benton, but he is expected
to be charged with her murder soon. He has also been linked to
eight other slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner acknowledged Friday that the betrayal his client's family
feels was probably rooted in a disagreement over semantics, a
difference in cultures and their naive lack of understanding of
Texas law.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner said the family has told him that no Texas lawmen ever
promised that the death penalty would not be pursued. As strange as
it sounds, he said, they simply feel that the word ``humanely''
means no death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people in Texas and around Texas know that it's a big
death penalty state,'' Tanner said. ``A lot of people in Mexico
might not know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dosal said the two consular officials had a ``cordial''
interview with Maturino Resendez, whom they described as ``very
calm'' and ``non-expressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject of his guilt or innocence did not come up, he said.
``The main objective was just to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Dosal said he asked the consulate to help his defense and was
told that officials would observe the legal process and ensure that
he is treated the same as any defendant.
</P>
<P>
   The two officials also asked him how his last name is spelled
and were told ``Resendiz.'' Maturino Resendez said he had several
names because his family registered in Mexico under different
names, for ``personal'' reasons that he declined to explain.
</P>
<P>
   But in court papers, the formal charge still spells it
``Resendez.''
</P>
<P>
   Dosal said Maturino Resendez had asked to be served kosher food
while in jail ``because he described himself as
''Christian-Jewish.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanner has said he hopes the consulate can make some type of
legal or diplomatic plea to help Maturino Resendez avoid the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the FBI denied that there was any arrangement that
Mexican authorities ignore U.S. efforts to capture the fugitive or
get him to surrender on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Don K. Clark, head of the FBI's Houston
office, said. ``In fact, I personally kept in contact with the
consul general here in Houston to advise him, to the extent that we
could, on what transpired so the Mexican government would not be
surprised. We had talked to the Mexican government, but this was
not a turn-your-back type of situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican police said Maturino Resendez never tried to surrender
to them, which could have started an international dispute over his
extradition.
</P>
<P>
   The state judicial police commander in Ciudad Juarez, Armando
Castillo, said, ``We tried to interview him, but we didn't find him
or even see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Castillo confirmed that his officers tried to find Maturino
Resendez in Juarez after receiving reports that he had been seen
there.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was no arrest warrant in Mexico for Maturino
Resendez, Castillo said authorities had been asked by the Interpol
office in Mexico City to detain him long enough to determine his
identity.
</P>
<P>
   He denied any prior knowledge that Maturino Resendez was going
to surrender. He also said he never heard of any bounty hunters
searching for Maturino Resendez.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been charged with a capital murder in the East Texas
town of Hughes Springs, is a suspect in five others in Texas,
including two in Harris County, and has been linked to murders in
Kentucky, where he has been charged, and in Illinois, where he has
not.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County is holding him in the Dec. 17 burglary of the West
University Place home of Benton, who was stabbed, raped and beaten
to death. West University Place is an enclave of Houston.
Prosecutors are not going to charge him with her murder until they
receive DNA test results, although Anderson says fingerprints
already have placed him at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA tests also could link Maturino Resendez to the death of
Noemi Dominguez, 26, who was killed in her Houston home in June.
Prosecutors also could file capital murder charges in that case,
but the evidence is more likely to be used in the punishment phase
of a trial for Benton's murder, if there's a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County Assistant District Attorney Lyn McClellan, who
will likely help lead prosecutor Devon Anderson in the case, said
Maturino Resendez complaint about ``humanitarian'' treatment is
just symptomatic of what a lot of criminal defendants experience _
a regret at having cooperated in any way with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   A promise that Maturino Resendez would not get the death penalty
would only be a problem for prosecutors if he had given authorities
a confession based on that, McClellan said, but that did not
happen.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said someone's nationality makes no difference in
prosecuting any case, and pleas from other governments for leniency
don't do any good either.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said he knows of no state law that requires local
authorities to advise foreign nationals of their right under the
1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations to ask their
government for help.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, Maturino Resendez was advised of that right
twice _ once in El Paso after he surrendered and again Thursday in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was done out of an abundance of caution because that
issue is being raised all the time now,'' McClellan said.
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
Advising people of those rights was an issue in the case of Joseph
Standley Faulder, the first Canadian in almost a half-century to be
executed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder was executed in Texas in June despite pleas from the
Canadian government and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder's attorneys tried to argue that Canadian officials
should have been told sooner of his arrest and detention and Texas
authorities should have informed Faulder of his right to contact
the Canadian government for help.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, Arizona executed Jose Roberto Villafuerte, a
45-year-old Honduran, for killing a woman in 1983. His government,
the Vatican and the State Department maintained he was denied his
rights as a foreigner under the Vienna Convention.
</P>
<P>
   A similar case in Virginia reached the U.S. Supreme Court.
Paraguayan national Angel Francisco Breard argued that his death
sentence for stabbing a woman to death was illegal because his
country did not know of his arrest or conviction. The Supreme Court
refused to block his execution.

 &HT;    Smoltz's return set vs. Phillies
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Given his good outing on Thursday night and the way
he felt Friday, the Braves plan to move ahead with the idea that
John Smoltz will be activated from the 15-day disabled list and
pitch the second day the Braves are in Philadelphia, on Saturday,
July 24.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox and Smoltz talked three times by telephone
Friday to set up what happens next as Smoltz makes his way back
from an inflamed elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz pitched two perfect innings for the Class AA Greenville
Braves in his rehabilitation assignment on Thursday, including four
strikeouts, using all his pitches. He is planning to go a couple of
more innings today. If all goes well, he'll join the Braves in Fort
Lauderdale on Wednesday, throw a side session there and then start
next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that is subject to change, but with the way he threw and
how he feels today, he's ready to go,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Cox is planning to use rookie Bruce Chen in the second game of
the doubleheader in Philadelphia on Friday. Chen will likely be
sent back to Class AAA Richmond when Smoltz is activated.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez may wait to catch
</P>
<P>
   Cox may scrap his original plans to have Javy Lopez catch today,
waiting instead until the Braves are in Toronto on Sunday or
Monday, or even as late as Florida next Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After playing for the first time in three weeks on Thursday
night as the Braves' designated hitter, Lopez said his knee was
fine. The only problem he had was feeling tentative on the
basepaths. His hard single in his first at-bat, he said, normally
would have been a double. Lopez went 2-for-4 in the game with two
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swinging was no problem at all,'' Lopez said. ``I can play DH.
I can hit without any pain.... I was careful running the bases.
That's not the way I run the bases. It's all about getting used to
it. Once I lose the fear of running the bases, I'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez ready for second half
</P>
<P>
   Odalis Perez will be making his first start today in almost two
weeks _ since July 5. He was sick the last time his spot was up in
the rotation. Perez pitched on the side at home in the Dominican
Republic over the All-Star break and said he's ready for a better
run in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie pitcher finished the first half without a win in his
last five starts to fall from 4-2 with a 4.48 ERA to 4-5 with a
5.28 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter how long it's been,'' Perez said. ``The
second half is my time to let them know I'm here and I want to do
better for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrill for McGlinchy
</P>
<P>
   Rubbing the head of the Babe Ruth statue in Monument Park was a
good memory for Braves rookie reliever Kevin McGlinchy, but he got
a better one on Thursday night when he struck out Derek Jeter. He
came back from a 2-0 count to strand Chuck Knoblauch at third base
and save the Braves a run in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first two pitches I was probably trying to throw too
hard,'' said McGlinchy, who threw Jeter all fastballs working both
sides of the plate. ``After the break, I was feeling pretty
good.... I knew I had a good fastball. I was going to go with it no
matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   For McGlinchy, who grew up in Malden, Mass., a Red Sox fan and
therefore a Yankee hater, it was his first time pitching in Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always good to beat the Yankees,'' McGlinchy said.

a spot recently re-named Gun Hill on military maps because of the
intense mortar fire that has been lobbed from its rocky summit.
Just as they have with the bodies of others, the Indians offered
them to Pakistan, but Pakistan, caught in what much of the world
believes is an elaborate fiction, cannot accept the dead from an
invasion force it has disavowed. (AFP for the New York Times) LITE

LITTLE LATE FOR SAMPRAS TO DOUSE AUSSIE FIRE

<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Today only: Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours late.
</P>
<P>
   When United States Davis Cup captain Tom Gullikson gets around
to dialing 911 and asking for Sheriff Sampras, the burglars named
Hewitt and Rafter are already sitting in the Aussie gang's hideout
counting the loot. It adds up to Australia 2, USA 0.
</P>
<P>
   It also adds up to a destructive blaze consuming the US Davis
Cup team at Longwood Cricket Club, where Friday 5,342 witnesses
were toasted like marshmallows on a 97-degree afternoon, and it was
even more Hadesian for the toilers on a hard-paved court, where
thermometers registered 126.
</P>
<P>
   Into this blaze, at this late date in a best-of-five series,
goes Sampras _ reduced to a mere fire extinguisher when he could
have been a a rescuing hook and ladder truck.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the best tennis player on the planet sat on the
sidelines as the US burned just about to the ground. Is this as
weird as a wombat, or what? Sampras, who should have been the
firemaker himself, grilling a few Australians over the weekend,
appears in a cameo role: a doubles player alongside Alex O'Brien.
Presumably they have been introduced to one another, although
that's not certain. What's certain is they've never coalesced on a
tennis court.
</P>
<P>
   This is playground pickup-game stuff. They walk onto the court.
One guy says, ``Hi, I'm Pete Sampras. Which court would you like to
play?''
</P>
<P>
   The other guy says, ``Oh, I've heard of you. I'm Alex O'Brien.
Say, don't you play singles anymore?''
</P>
<P>
   Not this week.
</P>
<P>
   Only a cameo. Sampras and O'Brien, trying to keep their side
breathing, though unlikely. It's Arnold Schwarzenegger and Don
Knotts, in tandem, hoping to save the farm from Aussies swarming
like locusts. In this 100th year of the Davis Cup, we have the
strangest American drama of all with Sampras cast as an extra.
Wilfred Brimley when he might have been Gielgud.
</P>
<P>
   His colleagues have voted Pete the greatest ever in their game,
but he didn't make his reputation in doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Pete says this is his choice. ``I didn't want to horn in on Jim
Courier and Todd Martin's show. I said if they'd have me I'd play
doubles. My decision. I made it. Not Gully.''
</P>
<P>
   A bad decision _ and acceptance by Gullikson. It's Nomar
Garciaparra, before a playoff series, saying to Jimy Williams, ``I
think I'll just pinch hit.'' Williams replies, ``Fine, Nomar. It's
pretty hot out there, starting and playing nine innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Or Luciano Pavarotti showing up for a performance of ``Aida'' at
the Met and telling the boss, ``I'm tired of being Rhadames. Guess
I'll just sing in the chorus, or carry a spear.''
</P>
<P>
   Puh-leeze!
</P>
<P>
   In their hour of need, prior to the opening-round series in
Birmingham, England, and after much pleading, Gullikson and the
team were turned down by Sampras. Then Martin and Courier waged
that magnificent 3-2 victory, and it became Sampras's hour of need.
``Inspired by those guys,'' Pete said, he wanted to enlist. But, he
insisted, only for the doubles cameo.
</P>
<P>
   But once they took the prodigal back into the fold, saying, as
Courier did, ``He'll strengthen us,'' he should have been a team
member in good standing. Not a spare part.
</P>
<P>
   For my money, Martin settled the issue after his Wimbledon
defeat by Patrick Rafter by saying, ``Pete should play singles in
Boston in my place.'' Extraordinarily selfless. Very Martin. But
also correct, if this is, as I understand it, a very well-paid
professional team. You need 3 points to win, and Sampras is a
potential 3-pointer as he was in the splendid 3-2 title-round
victory over Russia in Moscow four years ago. Sampras won both
singles plus the doubles with Martim, a solid mix.
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson was in the captain's chair. He should know that when
you've got a Pedro Martinez in the house, you don't put him on
short relief.
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson is an admirable guy, a fine ambassador for his
country, but he's the captain. Captains are supposed to lead, not
listen too much to the enlisted men such as Pete. Once Martin
cleared the way for Pete, you expected Gullikson to say, ``Pete, we
may need you to go three days, like Moscow. If you can't offer more
than doubles, check back with us next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine how this played out in, say, Davenport, Iowa, (possibly
named for Wimbledon champ Lindsay Davenport?)
</P>
<P>
   Maw and Paw are watching the US being torched on ESPN. Maw says,
``I'm a little puzzled, Paw. Remember Wimpleton and how good those
two guys Agassi and Sampras was. Ain't they Americans?''
</P>
<P>
   Paw says, ``I thought so. But, yeah, Maw, so why ain't they
playing today for the USA if they're good enough to do that at
Wimpleton? Sampras was fantastic. Ain't he on this team?''
</P>
<P>
   Not that you'd notice, but it's a good question, Paw.
</P>
<P>
   However, today only: Pete Sampras.

<P>
   GUN HILL (POINT 4875), Kashmir _ Up and down some of the
steepest peaks in the Himalayas are dozens of freshly dug graves of
unknown soldiers, men who India insists are Pakistanis and whose
nation dares not claim them.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian army buried five more bodies here Friday near the
crown of a mountaintop 16,500 feet high, a spot recently renamed
Gun Hill on military maps because of the intense mortar fire that
has been lobbed from its rocky summit.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they have with the bodies of others, the Indians offered
them to Pakistan, but Pakistan, caught in what much of the world
believes is an elaborate fiction, cannot accept the dead from an
invasion force it has disavowed.
</P>
<P>
   For two months, Pakistan has insisted that the hundreds of
invaders who had dug into mountaintop positions just inside
Indian-controlled Kashmir were mujahedeen, Muslim holy warriors,
though on Friday its army chief, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, told BBC
that Pakistani troops occasionally engaged in ``aggressive
patrolling'' on the Indian side. The Indians have from the
beginning maintained that the infiltrators were largely Pakistani
army regulars, a view increasingly accepted by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this terrible?'' asked Maj. Deepak Rampal, one of the
Indian officers who led the charge up Gun Hill. ``No government or
army ought to disown their people. Think of the humiliation for the
families at home _ the religious sentiments that will never be
fulfilled, the sons who will never know how and why their fathers
laid down their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months of intense fighting in these barren heights have
wound down to occasional fire. Whoever the invaders actually are,
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan asked them to withdraw, and
for nearly a week they have been doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Originally the Indians said all the interlopers had to be gone
by Friday, but they have since agreed to allow another 24 hours or
so.
</P>
<P>
   Now for India, with its war won, winning the news media seems
important. Hence, Friday's trip for reporters. ``Most of the bodies
we bury where we find them, but these we brought back up to the top
of Gun Hill to show the media,'' said Maj. J.A. Arif.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, glorying in victory, ferried a flock of reporters
up to the funeral atop the narrow peak, no easy expedition. Only
the smallest of helicopters could land on the one tiny wedge of
flat terrain. Eighteen visitors had to be flown in one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   A Muslim cleric from the army presided over a respectful if
abbreviated minute-long service. When he chanted ``Allah akbar,''
``God is great,'' six Hindu soldiers dutifully answered, ``Allah
akbar.''
</P>
<P>
   The bodies, covered with Pakistani flags, were then lowered into
a grave barely 2 feet deep. It is hard to gouge out a resting place
here. Up this high, the Himalayas are like a moonscape of
outcroppings and craters, their colors changing from brown to black
to purple. The surface is covered with sharp chips of slate. Not
far below is solid rock.
</P>
<P>
   The five men had been dead for at least 10 days. As they were
placed into the hole, the flags were removed. One man's leg
fluttered about as if no solid bone was left to hold its shape.
Another had but the smallest remnant of a right foot.
</P>
<P>
   The dead, by India's account, were among 53 of the enemy who had
been killed during a two-day battle for the peak that ended on July
6. The invaders had used what was then known as Point 4875 as a
perch for shelling a key Indian highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We advanced on them inch by inch under the cover of artillery
fire and flame throwers and rocket launchers,'' said Maj. Vikas
Vohra. ``When we finally came upon them, some were taking meals.
Their tea was piping hot. They were caught completely unawares.''
</P>
<P>
   None of those buried Friday were identified by name, but the
officers atop Gun Hill showed off several items that they presented
as proof of a Pakistani military presence. There were
identification cards from Pakistan's 12th Northern Light Infantry
and army pay books. There was a letter from a soldier to his
family.
</P>
<P>
   Such evidence is easy to falsify, as the Pakistanis have
charged. And indeed nothing that was presented by the Indians was
conclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Indians worked hard at making their case. Not far
from Gun Hill, at the Indian military base at Dras, a display had
been laid out of ammunition, weapons and gas masks _ all supposedly
standard issue of the Pakistani army.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Mohinder Puri made brief remarks. He was eager to
speak of the confiscated items, and eager to set the record
straight on something else: ``We have observation-post logs which
give us the details of when the Pakistanis arrived, which was some
time in the first week of April,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   That is important because some reports put the invaders in the
mountains as early as February. Indian intelligence agencies have
been heavily criticized for not discovering the intrusion until
May. If the invaders had been there for but a month, then India had
only been caught with its pants down around its knees, not its
ankles.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, better surveillance is required, and perhaps a
permanent presence in these peaks, Puri said, adding, ``We will
analyze a lot of things before deciding what type of deployment we
will have.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hale talk of victory, there was something melancholy
in the air. An air force commander confided that there had been
great glory in sending his men off on so many sorties, and he was
sorry to see the excitement end.
</P>
<P>
   Col. S.V.E. David, the army's deputy commander at Dras, said in
a conversation about the invaders, ``If you come eight, nine
kilometers inside your enemy's territory, why do you bloody run
away like a dog with its tail down?'' He seemed to feel his
opponent had quit the game at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have fought it out for longer,'' David said.
``They had the supply lines. They had the men. They could have
lasted 10, 15 more days. What they lacked, I think, was leadership.
Whoever was running things just couldn't keep the act together.''

<P>
   A jury in Bridgeport, Conn., found that Microsoft had not
violated antitrust laws in its dealings with Bristol Technology.
Despite the differences between that case and the federal antitrust
case brought by the Justice Department and 19 states, Microsoft has
been portrayed in both cases as an overreaching monopolist who used
its market power as a club. Steve Aeschbacher, a senior corporate
lawyer at Microsoft, said that the verdict strongly suggested that
the jury was ``impressed by all the evidence in the record of the

<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Thursday, July 15,
about a conference in Geneva on Jewish settlements in
Israeli-occupied territories misstated the outcome. The conference
did not declare that the settlements were illegal; it said that the
Fourth Geneva Convention, which forbids transferring populations in
occupied territories, is applicable to the territories occupied by
Israel and that its provisions should be fully respected in those
territories.

</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Friday, June 25,
about the religious connections of Martin Frankel, the fugitive
money manager from Greenwich, Conn., referred incorrectly to
restrictions imposed by the Archdiocese of Washington on the Rev.
Peter Jacobs, a Roman Catholic priest involved in Mr. Frankel's
dealings. In 1983 the archdiocese suspended Father Jacobs's
authorization to function as a priest, an action that invalidates
marriages he may have performed since then. The action did not
invalidate other sacraments possibly performed by Father Jacobs,
like baptisms or the celebrations of Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The article also misstated the clerical title of William E.
Lori, an official of the archdiocese who described the
restrictions. He is a bishop, not a monsignor.

BURTON S. DREBEN, NEGOTIATOR IN TENSE SITUATIONS AT HARVARD, DIES
AT 71 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ohio)   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Burton Spencer Dreben, a former Harvard dean who brokered some
of the most difficult negotiations between the Harvard
administration and leaders of the student uprisings there in the
late 1960s, died of lymphoma on Sunday at Massachusetts General
Hospital. He was 71 and lived in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A professor of philosophy at Harvard when both faculty and
students were debating fiercely contentious issues like the Vietnam
War, links with the federal government and the military, and the
student strike of spring 1969, Dreben, in his capacity as
parliamentarian of the faculty, preserved order at faculty meetings
by insisting on fair and open procedures.
</P>
<P>
   From 1973 through 1975, he served as dean of the Harvard
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. One of his policies was
cutting graduate school admissions by 25 percent on the principle
that only as many students as the school could afford to aid and
teach properly should be admitted.
</P>
<P>
   From 1976 to 1990, he was chairman of the Society of Fellows,
overseeing the selection of candidates for Harvard's most
prestigious postdoctoral fellowships.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as a mathematical logician, he focused on the historical
study of 20th-century philosophy. He was known for his witty
lectures at Harvard and, later, Boston University, where he taught
from 1991 to his death.
</P>
<P>
   Dreben, born in Boston in 1927, graduated from Boston Latin
School in 1945. He received a bachelor's degree from Harvard in
1949 and a master's degree from there in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   He taught at the University of Chicago from 1955 to 1956 and at
Harvard from 1956 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Dreben's first marriage, to Raya Spiegel, ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Juliet Floyd of Brookline; a
brother, Arthur, of Marblehead, Mass.; two children from his first
marriage, Jon, of Cambridge, Mass., and Elizabeth, of University
Heights, Ohio; and two grandsons.

`RETAIL POLITICS' IN IOWA INDICATES BUSH CAMPAIGN IS THE REAL
THING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Verv is cq)

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ As Gov. George W. Bush walked away, Gregg
White assessed his performance: ``He was good. He's a natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Good politician? Natural campaigner? No. Good, natural pancake
flipper.
</P>
<P>
   And baby-kisser and hand-shaker and autograph-signer and patient
listener _ even when a young man insists on discussing the
esoterica of soil conservation.
</P>
<P>
   After the tumult of his first presidential campaign trip to
Iowa, Bush on a second swing through the state Thursday and Friday
settled into ``retail politics,'' which even in the television age
is considered a requirement as the presidential season kicks off in
the small, manageable states of Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's refusal to set foot in either state until the Texas
Legislature adjourned at the end of May gave his competitors hope
that perhaps the governor's high-flying campaign was a political
chimera. But now, Bush declared in eight stops across Iowa, his
effort is clearly the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   So he showed up at a pancake breakfast in Tower Park on Friday
morning to ``mix and mingle,'' as the schedule called it, and flip
a few with White, a professional pancake master. For the record,
Bush landed six on the plate of Kelly Engenberger of the Des Moines
park department before one went awry and landed on the concrete
slab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, George, get out of the way, we want some pancakes,''
a man in the lengthening line called out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a voter, I'm getting out of the way,'' Bush shouted
back.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he has told his campaign officials he wants to meet
people when comes to Iowa, not ``give the speech and retreat as
soon as possible,'' as he told a drive-time interview with radio
station WHO Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that shaking hands with as many people as are willing
to come out in the hot sun to say hello to me is retail politics,''
Bush said Thursday in Waterloo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first trip was much more kind of an event,'' Bush said.
``This one is much more grass-roots politics in the sense that I've
gotten to shake a lot of hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to look them in the eye,'' he said. ``I want to
hopefully confirm that I'm their man.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not hard to do in the audiences that gathered for Bush's
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Huff was impressed in Waterloo, even more so after
Bush gave her a kiss as he finished shaking hands with almost 250
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped,'' said Huff, a former schoolteacher who is not
often involved in partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was already talking about a number of issues and
would get to more over the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a pace to a campaign that's important to maintain,''
said Bush, who has been giving he same basic stump speech for six
weeks. ``We've got a strategy, and by the time the main events
begin, I will have laid out what I intend to lay out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bush were to camp out in Iowa until the Aug. 14
Republican presidential straw poll, there would be several
candidates who would top his number of campaign days in the state.
Bush offers no apology for remaining in Texas through the
legislative session, although he now takes pains to tell Iowans how
their state has now seized his attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know that I'm coming to your state a lot,'' Bush
said as he started his tour Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Off the Bush bus (dubbed ``Asphalt One``), it's not hard to find
local Republican officials who are not committed to any
presidential contender and who are not awed by or sold on the
governor _ at least yet.
</P>
<P>
   Verv Davidson, GOP chairman in Hardin County, said he wondered
where Bush's strong polling numbers were coming from, and ventured
a guess that it was the work of the media and Republican
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what's happening,'' said Hardin, a retired
speech and English teacher. ``I feel like that this is all being
controlled too much from the top. They don't think the grass roots
out here has anything to do with it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl Winter, co-chairman of the Winneshiek County Republican
Party, said many in his area regard Bush as ``the glamour boy, the
idol of the media, who doesn't give a hang about Iowa. ... They
feel he's in the pockets of big oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the straw poll next month would reveal how his Iowa
campaign was progressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am told by my people that we are pretty darn well-organized,
and that a lot of people have been contacted,'' Bush said. ``But
that's going to be the interesting part of (the straw poll), to see
how well candidates are organized.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Hare, a member of the Black Hawk County Republican
central committee, said Bush's approach is ``retail'' if compared
with seeing a candidate only on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the groups are smaller than this,'' Hare said,
surveying the couple hundred folks gathered in front of the
Veterans Memorial Hall for the first stop on Bush's two-day tour.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller, indeed. When Bush's father started making the
presidential rounds in Iowa 20 years ago, he would often meet with
fewer than 10 folks in a crossroads coffee shop and consider
himself lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Even four years ago, this early in the process, Hare said, ``you
wouldn't have seen this many people.'' And it may be candidate
specific, Hare argued: ``Four years ago, we didn't have anyone as
exciting as Bush, frankly.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of sparring with Benjamin Netanyahu,
there was a palpable sense of embrace in President Clinton's
description Friday of his first extended encounters with the new
prime minister of Israel, Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The two men _ the president eager to seize some final
accomplishment as his term nears its end, and the prime minister
seeking peace and pursuing it _ lingered together Thursday night
amid the history at Camp David in the cabin where Anwar Sadat and
Menachem Begin concluded the brave bargain 21 years ago that set
the course for Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, the most decorated soldier in Israel's history, pored
over documents from that time, many with the handwritten
annotations of President Jimmy Carter, who served as midwife for
the Egyptian-Israeli accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``He read it all with great care,'' Clinton said in a telephone
interview Friday afternoon from Iowa. ``He talked about Sadat, what
a gutsy thing he did when he came to Jerusalem to talk to the
Knesset even before the agreement was signed. He described the
scene and what an important effect it had.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was moved by Barak's commitment to peace and by
his awareness of the risks it entails, for him personally and for
the Israeli people. Sadat was assassinated by Muslim radicals in
1981. Barak's mentor, Yitzhak Rabin, was murdered in 1995 by an
Israeli who opposed his efforts to make peace with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   The visit to the cabin where the Sadat-Begin talks took place
was part of a long evening for Clinton, Barak and their wives. They
talked over dinner for more than two hours. Then Clinton and Barak
spent three and a half hours together, breaking up well past
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   They spoke of their families and their politics, history and
health, war and peace, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laughed about a lot of things,'' he said, including what he
called the ``peculiarities of politics.'' He would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that despite Barak's reputation for dourness, he is
a ``generally cheerful person.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton believes that personalities and relationships can
fundamentally alter history, and he said he is hopeful that his
positive early start with Barak can help lead to substantial, rapid
progress in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he stood ready to do whatever is necessary _
even if that means stepping out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said this week that the United States had played an overly
intrusive role in Middle East talks over the last three years. He
said he would welcome American participation as a ``facilitator''
of dialogue, but not as an arbitrator of disputes or enforcer of
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Friday that he is happy to play a less central
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best peace process is one where critical decisions are
made with parties that have to live with the consequences,''
Clinton said. ``When they hit a bump in the road, someone
facilitates the next step.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you want is for the U.S. to be a genuine facilitator, to
make whatever helpful suggestions we can and be there to provide
whatever support we can for making the most difficult decisions. I
think that is the right thing to do. We can be honest mediators,
fair and sensitive to concerns of both sides, of all the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Barak hope that a close political and personal
bond between the Israeli leader and the American president can be
forged once again. Relations were cool to the point of frost under
Benjamin Netanyahu, the former prime minister, who made no secret
of his resentment of American interference in Israeli affairs. The
Clinton administration made little effort to conceal its desire for
Barak's electoral victory over Netanyahu in May.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was warm in his assessment of Barak. ``I like him,'' he
said. ``I can get along with just about everybody. The main thing
is the Israeli voters basically said, `We want you to pursue peace
with security and we want it concluded.' Because of his
distinguished military career, they were saying to him, `We trust
you to try to put this deal together, to protect our security but
complete the peace process if you can.'''
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli official who spoke with Barak after his meeting at
the White House on Thursday and his stay at Camp David said the
prime minister was ``most satisfied'' with his discussions with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Barak described the two couples' dinner as ``intimate and warm''
and said the Baraks were quite taken by the beauty and serenity of
Camp David, in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains about 80 miles
northwest of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After the dinner, Clinton and Barak sat down privately as their
wives engaged in a talk of their own. Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Barak
share an interest in women's health issues and in programs for
troubled youths. Mrs. Clinton said she would like to visit Israel
soon, according to the Israeli official who was briefed on their
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The Baraks and the Clintons had a quick breakfast Friday at Camp
David before flying off in different directions, Clinton to Iowa
for political appearances, Barak to Washington and then to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   They resume their visit Sunday, at an official dinner at the
White House for 400 guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I took away from it, frankly, was what a lively
intelligence this guy has and what incredible energy he has,''
Clinton said. ``He said a lot of people know a lot of facts about
history but often lose the forest for the trees. You have to
understand the big patterns in history and in politics to make the
right decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the new prime minister possesses a bracing
combination of ``energy, intellect and leadership capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know he is a passionate patriot,'' Clinton concluded. ``It
was fascinating to hear him talk about the history of Israel. I
could have stayed up all night listening to him, but we both got
tired.''

NEW YORK CITY BRACES FOR ANOTHER HEAT WAVE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City, barely recovered from a deadly heat
wave that plunged whole neighborhoods into darkness 11 days ago,
braced for more scorching weather this weekend with its Emergency
Operations Center on alert and Con Edison trying to assure a
jittery population that its engineers could avert a blackout this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the demand for power is not expected to hit the
record levels reached earlier this month, largely because the brunt
of the heat wave is to come during the weekend, when office
buildings and businesses are operating at less than full capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The thermometer was predicted to hit 98 on Saturday and 96 on
Sunday, which, when combined with high humidity, makes it feel like
105 degrees, said Todd J. Miner, a meteorologist at Penn State
University.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis of early July had a combined heat and humidity
reading, known as the heat index, of more than 110 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Many city residents are feeling especially vulnerable now
because a combination of high temperatures and a surge in demand
for electricity led to an 18-hour blackout on July 6 for 200,000
people in Manhattan north of 155th Street.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Both city officials and Con Edison said no specific
neighborhoods are considered vulnerable to a blackout this weekend.
But they said they would be closely monitoring the situation in
Washington Heights, where 7 of 14 of Con Edison's high voltage
cables called feeders had failed the last time.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Con Edison said they were in better shape going
into this heat wave than the last one, with just six feeder cables
down in the entire system of more than 1,150 such cables _ two in
suburban Westchester County and four in scattered parts of the
city. The officials would not specify which neighborhoods those six
cables served.
</P>
<P>
   On July 2, before the previous blackout, 13 feeder cables were
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will make every effort to insure that it doesn't happen
again,'' said R. William Donohue, the vice president for
distribution engineering at Con Edison. ``But there are no
guarantees in life.''
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   The city of New York filed suit against Con Edison this week,
without seeking a specific amount of damages, arguing that the
power failure was caused by the utility's failure to properly
maintain its cable network.
</P>
<P>
   The city Medical Examiner's Office attributed 31 deaths to the
last bout of blistering temperatures. To help people endure the
heat, the city is again opening 80 cooling centers at its public
housing projects and has offered to transport anyone deemed
vulnerable to the nearest such room.
</P>
<P>
   Fire, police and emergency medical services officials who
gathered in the emergency center in the World Trade Center complex
were also prepared to open 15 air-conditioned schools at night if
those afflicted by the heat needed a cool place to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said Friday that his department
had put enough off-duty police officers on call to be able to
deploy 500 to any area of the city within an hour. Several hundred
plainclothes officers already scheduled to work this weekend have
also been asked to don uniforms in case they were needed for street
patrols during a blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks with lights and generators have been deployed in various
neighborhoods, and extra 911 operators are ready to work if needed,
Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said other steps being considered included asking the
owners of large buildings like the Empire State Building,
illuminated throughout the last crisis, to lower their lights, and
even muting the glitter of the Great White Way of Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   There was some evidence that customers, especially those without
air-conditioners, were feeling a bit exposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be somewhere where there is AC, probably at the movies,''
said Mary Catanzaro, 29, a party planner from Brooklyn who does not
have any form of cooling device in her home, car or office. ``Last
heat wave I tried to go to the movies, but the theater's AC broke
down, so I could find no refuge.''

COURIER'S TROUBLES BALLOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE _ The display of frustration started with a
controversial line call and concluded when Jim Courier rolled his
eyes upon leaving his postmatch press conference. A
brightly-colored blimp floating above the Longwood Cricket Club and
a reporter digging for dirt on the Pete Sampras situation did not
escape outbursts by the red-headed, red-faced Courier.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was not Courier's day _ a 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-4, loss to
Australian Patrick Rafter attested to that. And it was also a
difficult day for the US Davis Cup team _ an 0-2 deficit at the end
of Day 1 did nobody on the home side proud. It took only 2 hours 19
minutes for Courier to fall from savior-in-waiting to the second
example of American singles failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had a task to handle, and I knew it was going to be a
difficult one _ regardless of what happpens in the first match,
I've still got to go out and play,'' he said. ``So I am prepared to
play either way. I felt fine when I woke up this morning. I felt
fine when I went on the court. I feel fine now. Somewhere in the
middle there, something went askew.''
</P>
<P>
   The first sign that something failed to follow a straight line
came in the ninth game of the third set, with the score four games
apiece. With Courier hoping to hold serve and soon thereafter take
a set from Rafter, a return by the American was called out.
</P>
<P>
   Courier thought the ball was good and spent 20 seconds staring
down the line judge. Once he lost the game and went down a decisive
break, he served a ball in the direction of the lineswoman before
switching sides. Rafter held serve in the 10th game and won the
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know on the tape it is going to be good, because my eyes are
a lot better than the linespeople. Otherwise, they would be
playing,'' said Courier. ``If their eyes were as good as mine, they
would be playing for a living instead of calling lines. It's funny
how players are rarely wrong. But it is pro tennis. It happens, and
unfortunately it went against me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally on a home Davis Cup tie, I am going to get those
calls. Seems like when we play away ties, I never get them. I think
that would balance out. But it didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The next object of Courier's wrath was the Monster.com blimp.
The airship spent the day dipping over the show court and
distracting servers. No one was more disturbed than Courier, who
thought of a new website address for the company. He referred to
the blimp as ``that Monster (expletive).com.'' When the player
learned the site helped people find jobs, he rolled his eyes and
held up his left hand as if he wanted to hear no more. The press
laughed, and Courier said, ``Whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the press conference, the questions focused on
Saturday's doubles match, pairing Americans Alex O'Brien and Pete
Sampras against an Australian pair that might now include Rafter.
But the American audience wanted to know whether Todd Martin might
replace O'Brien. The query was addressed to team captain Tom
Gullikson, but Courier decided to answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold on a second,'' said Courier, practically cutting off
Gullikson. ``Who is the captain? Are you the captain?''
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson went on to calmly answer questions about the doubles
pairing. To his right, Courier tossed the cap to his water bottle,
crossed his arms, and tapped his hands impatiently on his elbows.
The captain recapped the tough American start. Courier shook his
head and rolled his eyes.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Safeco Field, the most costly single-sport stadium in
North America, opened for Major League Baseball on Thursday night,
a $517 million expanse of art and green grass cradled by the marine
air of Puget Sound and the hopes of fans long blanketed in misery.
</P>
<P>
   But what was once heralded as a grand local celebration of the
national pastime is now soured by protests, legal threats and a
growing squall over how much the public should pay for stadiums
that enrich private owners.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the battle here is the Seattle Mariners' ownership
group. The owners, who include Microsoft billionaires, promised to
cover all cost overruns on the new park but have now stunned even
the team's strongest allies by asking for tax dollars to pay for
most of an overrun totaling $100 million, on top of $372 million
that taxpayers have already contributed to the stadium's cost.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, team owners including Ross Perot Jr., who is using
tax money to build an arena for his Dallas Mavericks basketball
team, and George W. Bush, who saw the value of his stake in
baseball's Texas Rangers rise to $15 million from $600,000 after
the public financed a new stadium for the club, have figured in a
debate that entwines the emotional threads of sports with the
strands of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the public is at its limit,'' said Thomas M. Finneran,
the Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, who led
the fight to curb the amount his state would pay to keep the New
England Patriots. The team is staying in Foxboro, Mass., with the
help of $70 million in state road improvements, after backing out
of a $375 million stadium deal with Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts are with the home team,'' Finneran said. ``But more
and more, people are saying enough of this kind of corporate
welfare. And I think the sports owners asked for the backlash,'' by
making exorbitant demands.
</P>
<P>
   The new home of the Mariners, with its Internet kiosks, views of
the Olympic Mountains and signature sculptures of baseball symbols,
has been hailed by fans and design critics alike as a wondrous
addition to Seattle. The 47,000-seat stadium _ which replaces the
drab, 23-year-old-Kingdome _ has a retractable roof, grass that can
be automatically heated to bring it out of its dormancy in the
spring and, hanging in a rotunda behind home plate, a chandelier of
1,000 translucent bats.
</P>
<P>
   Without the new stadium and the additional revenue that is
expected as a result, it is unlikely that baseball could have
remained in the city, said Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   But Safeco Field also has the distinction of being the first
ball yard built with public money after voters said no to paying
for it. It is a kind of dubious forerunner to stadiums that are
scheduled to open in Milwaukee next year and in Pittsburgh in 2001,
each built with tax dollars despite overwhelming, though
nonbinding, votes against using taxes for them.
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, what started as an effort to give one team, the
Pittsburgh Pirates, a new stadium to keep it from leaving one of
baseball's oldest venues ended up this year in the state's approval
of public financing for a new home for each of four teams _ two in
Pittsburgh, two in Philadelphia. The four stadiums will cost about
$1 billion, at least two-thirds of which will be public money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pennsylvania is a major league state, and we proved it
today,'' Gov. Tom Ridge, a second-term Republican, said after
guiding the stadium financing package through the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But many others were outraged, particularly in the Philadelphia
region, which had not been given a chance to vote on spending local
tax dollars for new stadiums, and in Pittsburgh, which had been
given the chance and rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It boils down to politicians' giving more money to certain
special interests that outweigh whatever voters may say,'' said
Jake Haulk, director of the Allegheny Institute, a conservative
public-policy organization in Pittsburgh. ``They used to justify
this on the grounds that these new stadiums were great economic
generators, but they have abandoned that line. Now they just say,
`We need to be a world-class city, and taxpayers will have to pay
for it.'''
</P>
<P>
   At least 15 major sports complexes around the country are to
open in the next three years, all but one, in San Francisco,
financed by the public. Through the 1990s, nearly $11 billion in
public money has been spent building and renovating sports centers.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, both the Yankees and the Mets have asked the public
to underwrite new baseball parks for them, although it appears that
the Yankees will now most likely stay put in 76-year-old Yankee
Stadium if $189 million in renovations are made in and around it.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by the runaway stadium plans of his home state, Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., has introduced a bill that would require
Major League Baseball and the National Football League to pay at
least 50 percent of the construction costs of new stadiums for
their teams. For parks already being built, the owners are
generally paying 10 percent to 30 percent, with the lone exception
of San Francisco, where the Giants are privately financing the
entire cost of $255 million Pacific Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Specter's bill has bipartisan support on the Senate Judiciary
Committee but is strongly opposed by baseball and football owners,
and other senators say it has only a slim chance of winning
passage.
</P>
<P>
   But a revolt, of sorts, is under way in a number of states. Gov.
Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, for instance, has drawn a line against
state financing of a new stadium for the Minnesota Twins despite
ownership's repeated threats to move the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``No pushing things down people's throats,'' said Ventura, who
last month set up a fund for Minnesotans who want to apply their
state tax rebate toward construction of a new stadium. ``This will
be the state's contribution,'' the governor said. ``It's called put
your money where your mouth is.''
</P>
<P>
   And in May, Arizona voters turned down a request by the owners
of the Cardinals to finance a new football stadium. The vote
followed by a year the opening a $354 million stadium in Phoenix
for baseball's Diamondbacks, a park financed largely by a sales tax
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The economics of major league sports, in which even mediocre
players demand long-term contracts of $50 million or more, is
largely behind the need for new stadiums and their
revenue-enhancing features, like luxury boxes, corporate suites and
innovative, interesting designs that can swell attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could owners build and pay for their own stadiums?'' said
Allen Sanderson, a professor of economics at the University of
Chicago, who has written extensively about sports financing. ``Yes,
of course they could. But then they would make less money. So they
go to the public instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's voters in 1995 narrowly turned down a proposal to
raise the sales tax to build a new home for the Mariners. But later
that year the team went on a magical run, coming from 13 games out
of first place late in the season to win the division title and
then beating the Yankees in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A fan frenzy and the Mariners' demand for a new stadium prompted
an emergency session of the legislature, which gave the green light
to a new taxing proposal. That proposal then went not to the voters
but to the governing King County Council, which approved it.
</P>
<P>
   The team's owners, a consortium of 16 members whose wealth is
drawn largely from local high-technology enterprises and the
Japanese-owned Nintendo Co., agreed to pay $45 million toward the
new stadium _ most of which they raised by selling to the Safeco
Corp. the right to name the park _ plus any cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   The owners say they have been losing more than $10 million a
year, and with the prospect of $20 million in new annual revenue
generated by Safeco Field, they ordered it rushed to completion.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just three weeks before it opened, they declared that tax
dollars should be used to pay at least $60 million of the $100
million overrun. They are threatening suit for that amount against
the Public Facilities District, the public agency that owns the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Political and business leaders who supported the team are
furious. ``I think all the unmitigated gall on the face of the
earth right now resides at Mariner headquarters,'' said Cynthia
Sullivan, a member of the King County Council.
</P>
<P>
   Although they earlier promised to cover overruns, the team's
owners say a close legal reading of the stadium financing contract
supports their claim for additional public money. They have refused
to respond in detail to questions about their position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize there are a lot of people who don't agree with us,''
said Howard Lincoln, a Mariner director who is chairman of Nintendo
of America. ``But even baseball owners are entitled to their day in
court.''
</P>
<P>
   The baseball commissioner, Selig _ whose family, owner of the
Milwaukee Brewers, is getting its own publicly financed stadium
next year _ praised the Mariner owners, saying they were ``heroes''
who had lost $80 million since they bought the team seven years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, they are the people that saved baseball in Seattle,''
Selig said. ``Without them, there's no team here.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, protesters marched outside the Mariners'
inaugural game at Safeco Field, holding signs reading, ``No More
Corporate Welfare'' and ``Keep Your Word.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Locke offered advice to fans who feel conflicted. ``It
is not a contradiction,'' he said, ``to say we love this stadium,
and it's gorgeous and going to make people of the Pacific Northwest
love baseball, but still insist that a contract is a contract, a
deal is a deal.''

MICROSOFT PREVAILS IN SUIT BY SOFTWARE MAKER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert missing word in 7th graf.)  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn.)   (See also MICROSOFT-WEALTH) 
(rk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a David versus Goliath case, a courtroom confrontation
between a struggling little software maker and the mighty Microsoft
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was accused of befriending the fledgling company when
it suited its interests and then callously casting the company
aside when it was no longer useful, denying it access to
Microsoft's technology on fair terms. The tactic, the plaintiff's
lawyers argued, was a violation of federal antitrust laws and all
but a death sentence for Bristol Technology Inc., of Danbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Friday, as an uptick in Microsoft's stock price lifted the
personal wealth of Bill Gates to nearly $100 billion, a Connecticut
jury of five men and three women, ranging in age from 21 to late
60s, whose job status ran the gamut from unemployed to corporate
executive, sided with Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   The jury in U.S. District Court in Bridgeport, Conn., found that
Microsoft had not violated antitrust laws in its dealings with
Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   The private suit in Connecticut has no direct impact on the
major antitrust challenge Microsoft faces _ the federal case
brought by the Justice Department and 19 states. The charges and
evidence are different.
</P>
<P>
   But antitrust experts said Friday's verdict would certainly
hearten the Microsoft legal team in Washington. Despite the
differences, Microsoft has been portrayed in both cases as an
overreaching monopolist who used its market power as a club _ a
characterization supported by piles of Microsoft e-mail and
internal documents that spoke forcefully of destroying rivals and
leaning on partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a decisive triumph for Microsoft, and it has to be a
shot of adrenalin for the Microsoft lawyers working on the
government case,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at the George
Washington University law school. ``This verdict may not have any
direct effect on the government case, but it shows Microsoft that
it can win these cases, even when much of the evidence in court is
unflattering.''
</P>
<P>
   In celebrating their victory, the Microsoft lawyers certainly
echoed the same themes of the company's defense in the government
case _ that its business practices are merely the rough-and-tumble
of modern capitalism, and that the computer software market moves
so rapidly that Microsoft can scarcely be considered an entrenched
monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The considered opinion of the community in which Bristol
operates is that Microsoft did nothing wrong,'' said David Tulchin,
a partner at Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell who was Microsoft's lead trial
lawyer. ``All that Microsoft did was compete hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Aeschbacher, a senior corporate lawyer at Microsoft, said
that the verdict strongly suggested that the jury was ``impressed
by all the evidence in the record of the intensity and dynamism of
competition in the software industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol had sought a stiff financial penalty against Microsoft _
damages ranging from $130 million to $263 million, which, if
Microsoft was found to violate antitrust laws, would be tripled.
</P>
<P>
   The jury did find that Microsoft had violated a Connecticut law
prohibiting ``deceptive practices,'' like making misleading
statements to a business partner. But for that unspecified
transgression, the jury awarded Bristol a mere $1.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not even a parking ticket,'' observed Kovacic of George
Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   Not even that for Microsoft, which has nearly $22 billion in
cash on hand, according to its most recent financial statement.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol said it disappointed by the outcome and that it was
``exploring'' the option of appealing the verdict. ``We still
firmly believe that Microsoft engaged in anti-competitive behavior
against Bristol,'' said Keith Blackwell, the chief executive of
Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Lynch, a partner at O'Melvany &AMP; Myers and lead counsel
for Bristol, said: ``This is a case of great importance to the
entire computer industry. While the ruling is disappointing to
Bristol, this is an issue that is not going to go away. Microsoft's
abuse of its dominant position has to be addressed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, antitrust experts say the Bristol suit was a high-risk
legal case from the outset. First, they say, the case focused on
the software markets for computer work stations and so-called
server computers, which feed data out to desktop machines in
computer networks. In those markets, Microsoft is not nearly as
dominant as it is in the market for desktop operating systems for
personal computers, where its Windows software runs more than 90
percent of PCs sold.
</P>
<P>
   Second, antitrust experts note that Bristol relied on the
antitrust theory that Microsoft had a ``duty to deal'' with
Bristol. And the experts point out that duty-to-deal cases, which
regard the plaintiff almost as a regulated utility, have been
difficult to win in recent years. The main exceptions, they note,
have been in industries with traditions of regulation, like
telecommunications, or businesses involving natural assets, like
ski slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, for its sweeping antitrust case, the government
did depose Blackwell of Bristol. But the Justice Department chose
to focus instead on Microsoft's use of its market power derived
from its dominance of the PC operating system market. The
government has charged that the company used its Windows monopoly
to stifle competition from the rise of Internet software. And the
government also steered clear of any duty-to-deal claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bristol chose to bring a case in one of the most pro-defendant
areas of antitrust,'' said Robert E. Hall, a professor at Stanford
University. ``Courts have been very reluctant to say that companies
must share their intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol makes software that allows programs written for
Microsoft's Windows to run on work stations or servers that use
Unix, an industrial-strength operating system popular among
corporate users. In 1994, when Microsoft was still having trouble
cracking into the market for corporate computing, it signed a
three-year licensing deal with Bristol. It allowed Bristol broad
access to Microsoft's Windows technology.
</P>
<P>
   But three years later, when Microsoft's own powerful operating
system, Windows NT, was making strong inroads into the corporate
market, the deal offered to Bristol was very different. Microsoft
wanted corporate customers to switch from Unix to Windows NT, and
Bristol alleged that its ``translation'' software _ once an asset
for Microsoft _ was now seen by Microsoft as a potential impediment
to the migration of customers to Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   So when renegotiating the contract, Microsoft offered Bristol a
new license, but at four times the price and with far less access
to Microsoft technology. ``Microsoft's dealings with Bristol are a
classic bait-and-switch,'' Lynch, the Bristol lawyer, asserted
before the trial began in June.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft did not deny that its license terms had changed, but
it explained that was because the market conditions changed.
Besides, Microsoft says that another company, Mainsoft Inc.,
accepted the same terms that were offered to Bristol. Microsoft
argued that Bristol was trying to elevate a garden-variety contract
dispute into an antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Inc. magazine ranked Bristol 140th among the 500
fastest-growing companies in the nation, with a payroll of 70
people and estimated revenues of $8 million. But the failure to
renew its Microsoft license has placed Bristol's future in doubt,
and it has spent heavily on its suit.

   ``Bristol's mistake was that it chose to litigate instead of
negotiate,'' said Aeschbacher of Microsoft.

<P>
   The jury in Connecticut agreed.

SPORTS COLUMN: MAKING A CASE FOR BOOMER
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger Clemens was back in Boston on Tuesday evening, but not to
play in the All-Star Game. Instead, the former Red Sox-turned-Blue
Jay-turned-Yankee was on hand to share a larger honor. He was being
introduced as a member of Baseball's All-Century Team. When his
name was called, Clemens, who for 13 seasons was the Red Sox' best
pitcher since Babe Ruth, was roundly and harshly booed.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has got used to being booed in Boston, but the more
bothersome boos were the ones that cascaded down on him at Yankee
Stadium on Thursday evening after he was knocked out and lost, 6-2,
to Tom Glavine and Atlanta. Asked whether he noticed the booing,
Clemens quickly and tersely said, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time earlier this season when even polite boos would
have been considered blasphemous. After all, the Rocket is a future
Hall of Famer. But in a shrine like Yankee Stadium, only a few
icons are beyond the fray _ and they are all in bronze. Anyone else
is fair game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just doesn't seem like he's in a comfort zone,'' Yankee
Manager Joe Torre said of Clemens. ``It's taken him longer than he
expected to fix this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the surest sign yet that the concern had reached the top of
the organization, George Steinbrenner paid Clemens a visit before
Friday night's game to see how he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   There is talk about the fans' patience wearing thin. The team is
in first place but not playing the flawless baseball it did last
season. Yankee fans ought to stop. After what the Yankees
accomplished last season, the good graces will last for another
season at least. Complaining about the Yankees takes fan
entitlement to a level of silliness unbefitting sophisticated
baseball followers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, much of the fan rancor is directed at Clemens, not the
team. Clemens said he came to New York to win a championship. Right
now, the team is simply marking time until the playoffs; then and
only then will we see whether Clemens is part of the solution or
part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has been erratic, and the fans' patience is definitely
wearing thin with his lack of control. They have waited half a
season for the Rocket to pitch like the Rocket. But Clemens is
following a tougher act than he realized. He comes to a storied
franchise, plays in a legendary stadium on a team coming off the
greatest season in baseball history. He is also playing in a city
of dreams and drama where night after night actors and actresses
outdo themselves on and off Broadway with transcendent
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Fans have come to baseball's theater and waited for Hall of Fame
performances, waited for Clemens to respond to big moments the way
David Wells responded before being traded to Toronto for Clemens.
Fans are waiting for the magic. So far, Clemens has brought neither
magic nor inspiration. Inspiration, of course, was Wells' forte.
</P>
<P>
   Now fans scratch their heads, wondering ``what's wrong'' with
the Yankees and ``what's missing.'' But nothing is wrong; Wells is
what's missing. He has what the Yankees need this season: soul.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, for all their Clemens-esque efficiency, have become
the American League version of the Atlanta Braves: cold and
calculating, but without fire. If you think I'm saying that Wells
needs to be back in New York, you're right. Wells needs to be back
in New York. But not in the Bronx with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells needs to be in Queens with the Mets. He is the spark
than can push this scuffling Mets franchise over the barrier that
has blocked the way for far too long. If Mets General Manager Steve
Phillips is the whiz kid he was cracked up to be _ and we haven't
seen all that much yet _ the Mets will find a way to make Toronto
part with Wells before the July 31 trading deadline. Yes, get Wells
even if it means parting with Roger Cedeno.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Mike Piazza, there are no untouchable
players on this Mets team. The Mets are not the Yankees coming off
a World Series victory and having to think about improving on near
perfection. These are the haven't-won-a-World Series-in-13-years
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The argument against trading a young player like Cedeno is that
he represents the future. The Mets' future is now. Cedeno, with all
his talent, will not take the Mets to a pennant this year. Wells,
backed by stellar defense, motivated by wounded pride, just might.
More than his pitching, the Mets need Wells' unpredictability and
irreverent presence.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade the Mets have sat and watched and wondered
how to steal the Yankees' thunder. Now they have their answer:
bring in the Boomer!

US FALLS BEHIND, 2-0, IN SWELTERING DAVIS PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The day straight off the charcoal grill
sizzled to an end with Australian Patrick Rafter tossing, throwing,
and drop-kicking tennis balls into the stands filled with wilted
Americans, followed by Rafter's shirt. Tennis buffs loved the
souvenir balls, women the shirt, and Australians the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to get any better than this,'' said Rafter,
after dispatching one of the few Americans who didn't wilt under
the heat or pressure, Jim Courier. ``We're going to have a great
dinner and a couple of laughs, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe some chuckles, too, being up on the United States Davis
Cup team, 2-0, after Day 1 of the Cup quarterfinals Friday at the
Longwood Cricket Club. Rafter overcame Courier in deceptive
straight sets, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-4, while 18-year-old Lleyton
Hewitt immediately put the US in dire straits by toppling Todd
Martin in the opening match, 6-4, 6-7 (1-7), 6-3, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Sampras _ yes, that Pete Sampras, the Pete Sampras who sat
on a very hot seat behind the American bench all day _ will team
with Alex O'Brien in Saturday's doubles match the US must win. But
since this is Longwood, where history oozes, consider this bit of
Americana: Only once (in 1934) has a US Davis Cup team extricated
itself from an 0-2 abyss.
</P>
<P>
   As wilted as any fan, as wilted as Martin, as wilted as the
American hopes was the US's approach of having a player tell the
coach who should play. But Sampras _ the world's best player _
insisted on playing just doubles out of deference to his teammates,
who have devoted more of their time to the Davis Cup than he.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision was made on principle,'' said US captain Tom
Gullikson, after the grim results guaranteed question after
question about his best player sitting out the first day's matches.
``Whatever you want to write or whatever you want to think is fine
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The asphalt court was frying at temperatures as high as 126
degrees when Martin and Hewitt opened their equipment bags shortly
after noon. The strategy for Martin was clear, for both physical
and psychological reasons. He had to jump on the nervous Australian
youngster quickly so as not to deplete his stamina and not allow
Hewitt to begin feeling comfortable in this pressure-packed
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game plan was for (Martin) to go out and dominate the kid
in his first Davis Cup,'' said Gullikson. ``We figured he would be
a little bit nervous and hopefully Todd would get off to a good
start and attack (Hewitt's) second serve and play more aggressive.
But the ball was flying on (Martin).''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an early turning point for Martin came when he was up,
2-1, in the opening set with three break points. It appeared he was
ready ``to dominate the kid.'' But Martin could not capture the
decisive point and instead of being up, 3-1, he lost that game and
then was broken by Hewitt to go down, 2-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``First set, I was up, love-40 on his serve and he got out of
that game and broke me right away,'' said the American. ``That was
a big momentum change.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt not only went on to win the first set, he had won the
confidence that he belonged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it was pretty tough for me to go to sleep (Thursday
night),'' said the Australian. ``I was trying to have an early
night but then I couldn't get to sleep for a couple of hours. So I
just got on the phone, called the folks back home and all the
mates.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, the fans, some 20 of whom were treated by Brookline
paramedics, were wilting in the heat. But Martin persevered in the
second set, escaping triple break point at 5-5, his final save
coming when he was finally able to get to one of Hewitt's magical
lobs and backhand a return that the 18-year-old drove into the net.
The two finally reached a tiebreaker and the American, to the
surprise of most, cruised to the first 6 points and won, 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won that set,'' said Martin, ``but listen, it would have
been much better to have won that set holding my serve throughout
the rest of the set than playing a very good tiebreaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Hewitt were 2-2 in the third when the American
crashed four winning serves, all the momentum apparently his. But
that pinnacle was followed by a sudden and steep fall over the
cliff as Martin could win only one more game the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was feeling the momentum,'' said Martin, ``more
because I had won the second set than because I was able to hit
four aces. Four aces is dumb luck, but the next game was where I
got broken. I thought I might have let down there just a couple of
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, said Hewitt, ``I felt Todd was starting to get a
little bit tired. I was thinking that whatever I am feeling, I am
sure he is feeling a lot worse than I am. So I went out there with
that attitude the rest of the match.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt (``I think Lleyton is one of the very few people in the
tennis world that have very, very great nerves,'' said Martin) then
dominated, taking the remainder of the third set easily and the
final at love.
</P>
<P>
   When Courier and Rafter took the court for the second match,
former president George Bush had fleed his first-row seat in search
of shade.
</P>
<P>
   The first set between Courier and Rafter was the brightest of
tennis jewels. Courier broke Rafter to go up, 3-1, but Rafter
lifted his play and won the next three games. At 5-6, Courier took
a splendid deuce point after a long and vigorous rally when his
shot apparently clipped the back of the baseline. Rafter didn't
agree, one of several calls the players would question. Courier
took the next point, the game, and stepped reached the tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   A tiebreaker, said Rafter, that ``was a comedy of a lot of
unforced errors. We were both trying to give that tiebreaker away
there for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The play had improved when the crucial point came at 5-4
Courier. A Rafter shot to the baseline was ruled in, while a
Courier return of that shot was called out. Rafter thought
Courier's shot was in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both had some bad line calls at some really crucial
times,'' said Rafter. ``His turned out to be more crucial than
mine.'' Courier said Rafter's ball ``just skidded off the back of
the line. That was a good call.''
</P>
<P>
   Courier gave the sixth point to Rafter on another unforced error
and then Rafter took the set with a winning serve. ``I think if Jim
had won that first set,'' said Gullikson, ``he would have gotten
some momentum going and hopefully the crowd would have gotten into
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The second set went to Rafter, 6-4, and the next crucial call
came at 4-4 in the third when another deep shot by Courier was
ruled out. Courier advanced to the net and stood there staring at
the lineswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see the videotape on that one,'' he said. ``I know
on the tape it's going to be good because my eyes are a lot better
than the linespeople. Otherwise, they would be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   So the US is down, 0-2, and the best advice _ the only advice _
to give the team was bestowed by Sidney Wood, a member of the 1934
team that is still the only US team to recover from being down two
matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Win the doubles, first of all,'' said Wood.

JOE HYMAN, 77, ESTABLISHED BRITISH TEXTILE EMPIRE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON Joe Hyman, a British magnate who took a brand name
associated with cozy pajamas and turned it into one of the great
textile empires of the 1960s, died July 6 at the age of 77.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of his success, he was seen as a swashbuckling,
impatient autocrat and as a pioneering proponent of corporate
growth by bold acquisition. But, after a tense board room coup in
1969 that ended his control of Viyella International _ the company
he had built into one of Britain's best-known conglomerates _ he
was unable to repeat his success in subsequent ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman was born in Manchester, in the industrial north of
England, on Oct. 14, 1921, into a family that had made a living in
textiles dating back to a great-grandfather in Russia. But when he
left the North Manchester Grammar School at age 16 he was reluctant
to work in the family business and struck out on his own. Working
from a small office in Manchester, he bought clearance garments
from manufacturers and sold them to wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   In the postwar era, Britain's textiles industry was dominated by
two giant groups _ Imperial Chemical Industries and Courtaulds Ltd.
_ that commanded the technology for synthetic materials at a time
when nylon was widely seen as a miracle ingredient for the garment
business.
</P>
<P>
   But while the companies produced the synthetic materials, Hyman
was widely seen as the entrepreneur who grasped the commercial
implications of brushed nylon and polyester-cotton mixes for the
1960s market. ICI, although often uneasy, invested in Hyman's
Gainsborough-Cornard company as an ally in its battle with rival
Courtaulds, helping him realize his vision of a textiles giant that
controlled every step, from spinning and weaving to finishing and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman's breakthrough came in 1961 when, after a bumpy start, his
company bought out a business called William Hollins of Nottingham,
which owned the Viyella trademark for a pajama fabric made by
blending wool and cotton.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the brand was associated by many people with
nightclothes worn by the very young and the very old. But Hyman's
ambition at that time, as he once remarked, was to get Viyella
associated with ``color, sex, romance, fast cars, that sort of
thing.'' He succeeded, proclaiming later, ``I got Viyella worn by
the jet set.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, ICI committed 13 million pounds to Hyman's business
ventures, and he went on a spree of acquisitions, including Van
Heusen shirts in Britain and leading businesses in spinning,
dyeing, finishing and weaving. By 1967, the 40 companies under the
Viyella International umbrella controlled great pieces of the
British textiles industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman's fall was even more rapid than his rise. In December
1969, board room resentment of his imperious management peaked,
and, at a late-night meeting his fellow directors ended his
chairmanship of Viyella International. The company was bought soon
afterwards by ICI. After a series of mergers, it has traded since
1986 as Coats Viyella.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman's subsequent career was less stellar. In the 1970s, as
recession deepened, he struggled with the woolens and worsteds
business, heading a Yorkshire company called John Crowther until
1980, when he retired to build a country estate in Surrey.
</P>
<P>
   For all his buccaneering reputation, he had never fitted the
cliche image of a bare-knuckled Lancashire textiles magnate.
Friends remembered him as polished and cultured with a love of
music and concerts. He was a trustee of the Pestalozzi Children's
Village Trust and a governor of the London School of Economics.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman first married in 1948 but the marriage ended in divorce.
In 1963, he married Simone Duke, who survives him. He is also
survived by four children, Howard, Penelope, Spencer and Daphne.

COMMENTARY: IS MIKE WALLACE READY FOR HIS CLOSE-UP? 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when the American media had checked out of Monicagate
rehab, secure in the knowledge that only shut-ins have time for the
press-bashing panels on C-Span or the ecclesiastical prose of
Brill's Content, along comes Hollywood to ruin everything. In
November, the country will be bombarded with the most high-profile
screen account of big-time, brand-name journalism since ``All the
President's Men,'' and while it may well prove a hit, it's not
going to set off another stampede to the nation's journalism
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, titled ``The Insider,'' is an up-to-date antidote to
its classic predecessor. In place of Robert Redford and Dustin
Hoffman as crusading reporters who take on a president to the
cheers of their editors at The Washington Post, we have Al Pacino
as Lowell Bergman, Mike Wallace's longtime producer at ``60
Minutes,'' who takes on Big Tobacco only to find his scoop
squelched by his network bosses. The movie doesn't celebrate a high
point representative of American journalism in the '70s but
dissects a low point that may be all too representative of the
'90s. Even when the hero's big story is belatedly aired, he feels
more disillusioned than vindicated and leaves ``60 Minutes'' for
good _ eventually to seek freedom as a free-lancer, with
assignments from PBS' ``Frontline'' and The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Well before its release, ``The Insider'' has kicked up its own
news in a string of publications, including The New York Times,
because of Wallace's objections to its portrayal of him in an early
draft of the script that he read. Wallace has not yet been shown
the film. I have seen it and talked to the warring and semi-warring
parties, including him, Bergman, Don Hewitt (the ``60 Minutes''
executive producer), Michael Mann (the film's director and
co-author) and Marie Brenner (whose Vanity Fair story spawned the
screenplay).
</P>
<P>
   They can and perhaps will debate until next year's Oscars about
the dramatic license ``The Insider'' takes with what happened at
``60 Minutes'' four years ago, but it won't matter. Its
Hollywoodisms notwithstanding, this movie does show what can happen
to journalism _ especially on TV, the prime source of news for
two-thirds of Americans _ in an era when a network news division is
just another entertainment profit center, like theme parks and
logo-laden tchotchkes, in a megacorporation.
</P>
<P>
   No one, including Wallace and Hewitt, can dispute the big
picture presented by ``The Insider.'' In 1995, CBS lawyers and
executives did in fact overrule its journalists and spike an
interview with Jeffrey Wigand, a former Brown &AMP; Williamson tobacco
executive turned courageous whistle-blower. The piece was killed
not because it was false or libelous but because it might have
brought a disruptive lawsuit at the time the network was being sold
by Laurence Tisch to Westinghouse. If The Washington Post had
cowered before Attorney General John Mitchell the way CBS did
before Big Tobacco, the Watergate cover-up might have remained in
place and Diane Sawyer might have spent decades fielding calls from
Bebe Rebozo instead of taking her own leap into TV news.
</P>
<P>
   While ``The Insider'' fudges chronology and makes Pacino's
Bergman into a superman that even the real-life prototype finds a
bit ``too neat,'' it is no more fictionalized than was ``All the
President's Men,'' or, for that matter, ``Schindler's List.''
Hewitt is presented as caving in to the film's barely veiled
versions of CBS's then general counsel, Ellen Kaden, and news
division president, Eric Ober (now president of the Food Network) _
and he's publicly acknowledged on camera that he did so, in a 1998
PBS ``American Masters'' documentary. ``I was somewhat of a bowl of
Jell-O,'' he said of what was ``not (his) proudest moment.'' As for
Wallace, he is portrayed as reluctantly toeing the corporate line
at first, then joining Bergman's crusade to get the story out. It's
a plausible interpretation of his public posture at the time, and
not remotely as damning on screen as he fears. He's played by
Christopher Plummer, who can make even the character's occasional
prima-donna moments elegant. (``The fact that Mike has a temper is
not a state secret,'' says the real-life Bergman.)
</P>
<P>
   The real-life Wallace is celebrating his 60th anniversary in
broadcasting this month, and doesn't want to be ``memorialized'' in
a Hollywood ``morality play'' about this one story. He won't be.
The movie won't alter his reputation as the outstanding
correspondent on TV's first and still best news-magazine show. But
the shock of the Wigand incident _ an anomaly for ``60 Minutes''
but not for network news _ was real, and from his long historical
perspective he sees its significance as clearly as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   As Wallace says, the killing of the interview ``would have been
unthinkable under Dick Salant,'' the CBS News president of the '60s
and '70s. ``Bill Paley (then the CBS chairman) was not happy
sometimes with us or with the Watergate stuff Cronkite was doing,
but Salant insulated us. When I got the documents on the Pinto _
and Ford was our biggest sponsor on `60 Minutes' _ there wasn't a
whimper from Salant, not a whimper.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems like a distant era, and, as Hewitt is quick to point
out, even a film like ``The Insider'' is not free of the conflicts
that now emerge when news and entertainment meet in unholy synergy.
The movie's producer, Disney, owns ABC News, which itself
capitulated to Big Tobacco in 1995 by apologizing to Philip Morris
for a news-magazine piece that many feel the network could have
successfully defended in court. That incident, though preceding the
Wigand interview, is happily forgotten in ``The Insider.'' Hewitt
is also not shy about saying that he considered doing a ``60
Minutes'' expose about how ABC News killed a ``20/20''
investigation into pedophilia at Disney theme parks last year.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't just corporate conflicts and self-censorship that
account for what's happening to news right now. The more pervasive
crisis is the usurpation of news principles by the esthetics of
show biz. As Hewitt concedes, the success of ``60 Minutes'' has cut
both ways. By demonstrating that a news broadcast could be hugely
profitable _ instead of just red-ink public service, subsidized by
sitcom hits _ his program spawned the countless imitators that now
fill up prime time. By proving news could borrow from the arsenal
of show-biz techniques _ including a correspondent star system and
slam-bang dramatic storytelling _ ``60 Minutes'' paved the way for
the abuse of those tools by its ubiquitous progeny.
</P>
<P>
   At their worst, TV news magazines use the same fictionalizing
sweeteners as movies like ``The Insider'' _ injecting music and
melodrama, smoothing out moral nuances _ but, unlike Hollywood's
entertainments, they present themselves as documentaries while
doing so. Sometimes (and not just in the case of Peter Arnett's
``Tailwind'' fiasco) the ``correspondents'' on TV news magazines
are merely telegenic fronts who have little involvement with the
reporting of their stories _ which is to say, they're star actors
playing a role. Though Wallace is an active collaborator in his
pieces, ``The Insider'' accentuates the large off-camera
contributions of producers by casting its biggest name, Pacino, as
Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   As with ``All the President's Men,'' history gives ``The
Insider'' a happy ending of sorts. Jeffrey Wigand, played by
Russell Crowe, does finally expose Big Tobacco much as Deep Throat
did Richard Nixon. But the ending doesn't feel happy, and the movie
doesn't seem like settled history. While CBS and ``60 Minutes''
have rebounded since this breach, the reporting of news
increasingly seems beside the point on television. There's no
profit to be had in independent high-powered investigations of,
say, Fortune 500 sponsors, and so there isn't much. Soft features
and softball interviews, with questions negotiated by celebrity
subjects in advance, are proliferating. News divisions are now
often so impotent within their own corporations that, as was
reported last week, the president of ABC News got nowhere when he
tried to prevent ABC Radio from hiring Matt Drudge.
</P>
<P>
   There are many more behind-the-scenes stories waiting to be told
about TV news. If Hollywood can make a movie about the
grandfatherly gang of ``60 Minutes'' sexy to a mass audience, maybe
a backstage examination of Stone and Jane at ``Dateline NBC'' can
be marketed along the lines of ``Eyes Wide Shut.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDLAND, Mich. _ They all played their classic roles once word
got out last November that a Dow Chemical Co. contractor had
repeatedly spilled toxic dust intended for Dow's incinerator.
</P>
<P>
   Denunciations poured forth from outraged environmentalists like
Diane K. Hebert, chairwoman of a local group called Environmental
Health Watch. ``We are shocked by the carelessness and indifference
that allowed these dangerous spills to occur,'' Ms. Hebert told The
Detroit Free Press. ``Dow's negligence has endangered our
community's health.''
</P>
<P>
   Dow was a predictable corporate heavyweight, announcing that it
was cooperating with an investigation by state regulators and
barred from saying much. Local coverage, trotting out old
descriptions of the wastes at the plant site, made it appear that
Jeffrey Feerer, the environment, health and safety manager for the
manufacturing operations here, was minimizing the presence of
dangerous dioxin by characterizing the spills as little more than
``sand and dead microbes.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as the adversaries squared off in public, they quietly
continued collaborating on a novel two-year drive to slash toxic
chemical emissions from Dow's vast chemical complex on the eastern
edge of town. The two sides were out to discover whether
environmentalists armed with detailed information about a company's
business needs and processes could help it find and carry out
profitable ways to cut waste.
</P>
<P>
   It was an uncomfortable alliance, fraught with risks for both
sides. Some people at Dow feared that giving some of their harshest
critics such an intimate look at operations would blow up into a
public relations nightmare or lead to leaks of confidential
information to competitors. Ms. Hebert and the other
environmentalists involved agonized over whether Dow might exploit
the exercise to make itself look environmentally responsible
without producing meaningful changes.
</P>
<P>
   As the November clash and previous public battles over a new
waste-water treatment project here proved, even the most successful
collaboration could not paper over all of the adversaries'
longstanding differences. (The spill investigation is pending.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, everyone stayed the course. By the time the project was
completed, on April 30, Dow was on track to cut production of a
list of toxic chemicals selected by the environmentalists by 37
percent and to reduce the release of the chemicals to the air or
water by 43 percent. To the surprise of both sides, the project had
beaten a goal of 35 percent reductions on both measures, which had
seemed a stretch in the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Dow's investment of $3.1 million to make the changes
is expected to save it nearly $5.4 million a year and, for some
businesses, improve product quality or add to production capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Companies and environmental groups have worked together in the
past on pollution prevention. But the depth and length of Dow's
relationship with the environmental activists is prompting talk of
a new era of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This partnership will almost certainly become a model
nationally among companies looking to improve the environment and
improve their bottom line,'' said Carol M. Browner, administrator
of the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Mongan, manager of environmental stewardship for DuPont,
the nation's largest chemical company, said he was impressed by
what he heard at a recent Dow briefing for the industry in
Washington. ``It looks promising,'' Mongan said.
</P>
<P>
   The groundwork for the project was laid in 1996 by Dow and the
Natural Resources Defense Council, the environmental policy group
based in New York. They recruited five longtime local critics of
Dow, a step that both agreed was crucial to the project's
credibility and impact on local managers.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge was to find big reductions that would actually
save Dow money _ a search for so-called low-hanging fruit. In
addition to Ms. Hebert, the critics were Mary Sinclair, who led
protests that squelched Dow's efforts to have a nuclear power plant
built here in the 1970's; Terry Miller of the Lone Tree Council in
Bay City, Mich.; Anne Hunt of Citizens for Alternatives to Chemical
Contamination in Lake, Mich., and Tracey Easthope, director of
environmental health at the Ecology Center in Ann Arbor.
</P>
<P>
   Dow believed there were few opportunities for reductions,
because the site had been working on pollution controls for two
decades. The environmentalists, assuming that businesses were adept
at spotting profit-enhancing environmental projects, also had their
doubts.
</P>
<P>
   But Dow managers and their new environmentalist advisers quickly
found a startling array of prospects that had been routinely
overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Dow, for example, discovered that introducing new chemical
catalysts and making other innovations in the manufacture of
resins, combined with modifications in the processing equipment,
eliminated a nasty byproduct, formaldehyde-laced tars. The one-time
cost of the project was $330,000, while the savings at Dow's
waste-treatment plant totaled $3.3 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Dow managers became especially intrigued by the money-saving
moves turned up by Bill Bilkovitch, a tireless environmental
engineering expert based in Tallahassee, Fla., who spent more than
two years at the site. In one embarrassingly simple case,
Bilkovitch pointed out that Dow could save $34,000 annually and cut
34,000 pounds of emissions of a toxic chlorine compound used in
making Saran plastic products by transferring it to storage tanks
twice a day instead of all at once. By filling only half the tank
the first time, vapors no longer had to be vented to the
incinerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these projects were too small to be seen as real
business opportunities,'' said Linda E. Greer, an environmental
toxicologist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, who worked
with Dow to recruit the local environmentalists and organize the
project.
</P>
<P>
   As surprising as the savings were, the most provocative aspect
of the project was the crucial role the environmentalists played
and Dow's willingness to lower its guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a heroic decision to bring in their most vocal
critics,'' Ms. Greer said.
</P>
<P>
   Dow let the environmentalists choose which toxic chemicals to go
after. It accepted their list of 26 without argument, even though
many were selected mainly because they can produce dioxin when
burned. That required stifling any impulse to defend the company's
longstanding position that critics exaggerate dioxin's health risks
and industry's role in creating dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   The company also accepted the aggressive, 35 percent reduction
target and, with many qualms, the environmentalists' refusal to
sign any confidentiality agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists reviewed and signed off on Dow's desire to
use Bilkovitch as an independent expert in hunting for
pollution-prevention opportunities. Both sides agreed on retaining
John Ehrman, a mediator with the Meridian Institute, a nonprofit
group in Dillon, Colo., to keep them focused on the narrow goal of
reducing toxic wastes. To insure that the environmentalists felt
confident about the data they were receiving, Dow agreed that they
could hire Steven Anderson, an environmental consultant based in
Bordentown, N.J., to review Dow records and advise on technical
matters.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most unusual, Dow told the production managers and
technicians who actually produced the plastic packaging,
pesticides, drugs and myriad other products at the complex's 40
plants that they would have to present their pollution prevention
projects directly to the environmentalists for approval and, once
the projects were started, to show them their progress reports.
Normally, employees in the operating trenches are shielded from the
scrutiny of outside critics by health and safety intermediaries
like Feerer.
</P>
<P>
   As the months went by, the apprehensive Dow managers were
surprised by the cordiality of the environmentalists and their
interest in the intricacies of the businesses. The
environmentalists were not always equally relieved, especially when
listening to managers who they said seemed uninterested in the
impact of toxic chemicals as long as their operations were
complying with all environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready to bite my tongue in half listening to some of the
presentations,'' said Ms. Hebert of Environmental Health Watch.
``They really didn't understand why we were concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the tension, though, the exercise bore fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Dow clearly wanted the Michigan Source Reduction Initiative, as
the project was formally known, to succeed. It took pains to get
that message across to the midlevel managers involved. Senior
executives like Vince Smith, the site manager, and Jerry Martin,
the corporate vice president in charge of environmental affairs,
attended every quarterly meeting with the environmentalists to
underscore the company's commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Face time with senior management and the chance to impress
them is a great incentive for many young managers,'' Feerer said.
</P>
<P>
   One manager, Michel Piche, the head of a latex-manufacturing
unit, said he was struck by the thoroughness of Bilkovitch's
research into Dow's problems with butadiene, a chemical used to
make rubber and resins. To gather data proving that Dow could cut
the amount of butadiene it loses to incineration if a supplier
would refrigerate it before shipment, Bilkovitch studied 1,000
rail-car loads of the highly reactive chemical to show how
concentrations of an unreactive form of butadiene called dimer
build up with time and heat.
</P>
<P>
   Dow now knows that refrigeration will slow the buildup of dimer,
enough to improve the efficiency of a recycling system in the latex
operations that has to be flushed when dimer levels threaten to
clog it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very often you collect ideas but lack the resources to pursue
them,'' Piche said.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the gains from the project came not from new
ideas but from making sure that old ones were executed. For
example, Dow had installed a $750,000 steam-based system in 1995 to
recover toluene and chloroethane, two toxic chemicals needed to
make Ethocel, a stabilizing and binding agent used in products as
varied as construction materials and time-release drugs. But the
Ethocel production group had put off figuring out how to adjust the
size of the Ethocel granules to make the recycling system
efficient, and the system had often been bypassed for weeks at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, said Dave A. Midkiff, manager of the unit, the production
adjustments have been made, and if the recovery unit goes down for
a shift, technicians are called in even if it means paying
overtime. Midkiff said he had tied a portion of his engineers' pay
this year to the performance of environmental equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The fragile trust established by so much effort hung in the
balance for several weeks after news of the waste spills last
November. In the end, thanks largely to the counseling of Ehrman,
the mediator _ who had been hired in anticipation of just such a
crisis _ no one walked away.
</P>
<P>
   The project can point to achievements beyond its stated goals
and deadlines. There have been major reductions in emissions of
chemicals not specifically selected for the project. Also, the
gains reported for the selected chemicals did not include those
expected from proposed improvements that did not have budget
approval by April 30. Other projected gains _ like a plan to reduce
wastes by shipping toxic chemicals to Dow recycling plants in other
states _ were excluded from the official results because the
environmentalists oppose putting hazardous materials on the roads.
</P>
<P>
   Dow is laying plans with Bilkovitch and Ms. Greer to duplicate
the Midland experiment at its even larger petrochemical complex in
Freeport, Tex.
</P>
<P>
   One hope is that next time around, Dow and the environmentalists
can achieve a goal they call ``institutionalization.'' Basically,
that means measurably changing the corporate culture so that
low-level managers routinely look for the kinds of improvements
made here _ something that everyone involved agrees eluded the
Midland project.
</P>
<P>
   Such mental readjustments are tougher to track than waste
reductions. The Midland project conducted a survey early this year
on the attitudes of business managers toward pollution, but the
project failed to figure out how to link the data to
institutionalization.
</P>
<P>
   The company and its environmental critics agree that pollution
prevention is likely to stall if business managers do not embrace
it. Businesses have many reasons to forgo waste-reduction
opportunities. For instance, other undertakings may offer greater
returns on investment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, testing to prove the value of a pollution
prevention plan may take too much engineering time, or the changes
could interrupt production.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, environmentalists say, the financial payoff from
being environmentally friendly is too small to make much of an
impression on the corporate mind-set. They say that the projected
annual savings of $5.4 million from the three-year waste-reduction
program here represents just five-tenths of a percent of the $1.31
billion Dow earned last year on sales of $18.44 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's spit in the ocean,'' said Ms. Easthope of the Ecology
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Dow executives say such comments underestimate how much
environmental savings add up. They also say that their commitment
to pollution prevention goes far beyond today's bottom line,
citing, for instance, corporate goals for cutting worldwide
emissions of hundreds of toxic chemicals by 50 to 90 percent in the
10 years ending in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows exactly what a sustainable company looks like,
but pollution prevention has to be a first step,'' Feerer said.
</P>
<P>
   Dow's environmental partners here worry that reports of the
project will ``greenwash'' Dow, making it look more environmentally
responsible than they think it is. They also fear that critics of
regulation, if not Dow itself, will trumpet the success as an
argument for depending on voluntary measures to improve the
environment. Cooperation like this project, they say, should not
hide the need for stricter government oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect we'll get criticism from environmentalists over
this,'' Ms. Easthope said. ``I'll probably agree with a lot of
it.''

FEARS OF MILITARY CONFRONTATION WITH CHINA SHAKE TAIWAN FINANCIAL
MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Fears of a military confrontation with China swept
through financial markets in Taiwan Friday, causing the biggest
single-day plunge in the stock index in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   In a panicky wave of selling that began on rumors of Chinese
military action against Taiwan, the Taipei stock index fell 6.4
percent, or 506 points, to close at 7,411. The jitters spread
across the region, with stock markets' dropping in Tokyo, Hong
Kong, and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between China and Taiwan have been growing since last
weekend, when President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan unexpectedly dropped
the long-held premise that Taiwan and China are separately governed
parts of the same country. Lee declared that the countries ought to
negotiate on a ``state-to-state'' basis.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government responded with denunciations of Lee and
warnings that it was ready to use military force to stop Taiwan
from declaring independence from China. The warning led newspapers
in Hong Kong to report that China might seize a couple of islands
off Taiwan as a show of force.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials in Taiwan flatly denied the reports, saying
they had detected no Chinese military movements. But the damage was
done. Despite aggressive buying of shares by the government this
week, Taiwan's market has fallen more than 13 percent since the
dispute erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic politics has deepened the instability. A popular former
governor of Taiwan, James Soong, announced Friday that he would
break away from the governing Nationalist Party and run for
president next year as an independent. Although Soong's move was
widely expected, it exposed a fissure in the Nationalists, who have
governed Taiwan for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said they worried that prolonged instability could
derail the economy, which managed to get through the Asian crisis
largely unscathed and had been picking up steam lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting a low-intensity confrontation across the
straits, which could last until the presidential elections next
year,'' Dong Tao, a regional strategist at Credit Suisse First
Boston in Hong Kong, said. ``Obviously, the longer it lasts, the
more negative the impact on the economy would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Tao said Taiwan was more vulnerable to a crisis of confidence
than other countries, because a large percentage of people's wealth
is tied up in stocks. So a further drop in share prices could cause
a decline in consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's economy is driven by exports, particularly
semiconductor chips and other computer components. A growing
confrontation could prompt computer companies in the United States
to cancel orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened in 1995, it could happen again,'' Tao said,
referring to a dispute in which China conducted military exercises
and tested ballistic missiles near Taiwan. That crisis, defused
after President Clinton sent two aircraft carrier groups to the
region in 1996, had measurable negative effects on the country's
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Before the verbal fireworks this week Taiwan had emerged as the
economic star of Asia. Although the country never fell into a
wrenching recession like its rivals Hong Kong and Singapore, its
growth slowed, from 6.8 percent in 1997 to 4.8 percent last year.
After a shaky start this year, analysts said, Taiwan's domestic
spending and exports had picked up strongly.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Credit Suisse First Boston predicted that Taiwan's
economy would grow 3.5 percent in 1999. In May, it raised its
forecast, to 5.2 percent. Tao said the firm had been on the verge
of raising it again, to 6 percent. Now, however, he said it would
hold off until the end of the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``From time to time, China finds ways to make Taiwan feel
uncomfortable,'' Tao said. ``I don't think it would go so far as to
fire missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Few experts said they believed that the tension would escalate
into a shooting war. Some even said the sharp drop in the Taiwanese
market is a good opportunity to invest. But the sell off was a
reminder that the Asian recovery is a fragile phenomenon, driven by
market psychology, as well as economic fundamentals.

IN IOWA, CLINTON MAKES CASE FOR SCHOOL SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ President Clinton on Friday pitched his $24.8
billion plan to modernize 6,000 schools, saying students could not
do their best work in buildings ``where kids walk up the steps and
they see broken windows every day, where there are rooms, in some
cases whole floors they can't even go on.''
</P>
<P>
   He also commiserated with Iowa's small farmers who have been hit
hard by crop prices that have fallen below the cost of production
in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   Joking that he was the only noncandidate Iowans had seen in
weeks, Clinton spoke in a newly refurbished, but sweltering,
gymnasium at Amos Hiatt Middle School, a 74-year-old building where
recent repairs were paid for through an $18 million federal
demonstration project. A line about how some schools do not even
have working heating and air-conditioning systems got a huge laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tied the need for school construction, through
interest-free bonds, to the broader debate about how to spend the
budget surplus. ``I believe before we pass a big tax cut we should
save Social Security and Medicare and add a prescription drug
benefit to Medicare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the outlook for Clinton's proposal in Congress is uncertain.
It was defeated as an amendment to a tax bill this week in the
House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time of confidence and pride,'' Clinton said of the
current economic boom. ``But the time to fix the roof is when the
sun is shining, and that is literally true in the case of school
construction.''
</P>
<P>
   These are not boom times in Iowa, though, and Clinton
acknowledged that farmers were among those who have not shared the
wealth. Only a day earlier, he was criticized by George W. Bush,
the Texas governor and Republican presidential candidate, for
ignoring the plight of farmers during his cross-country tour last
week to highlight pockets of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Clinton said, ``The big problem on the farm is we've had
four years in a row of worldwide record harvest for the first time
in history, and an economic collapse in 1997 in Asia, so markets
shrink, the products go, prices collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, a woman in the crowd shouted out, ``Freedom to
Farm!'' referring to the Freedom to Farm Act, a 1996 law that
phased out most direct crop subsidies and encouraged high
production at a time when the Asian financial crisis had limited
the buying power of overseas customers.
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, Bill Sherman, a local lobbyist for the
teachers' union, said the farm crisis had, among other things, made
it much harder to pass bond issues for school construction. ``Until
farmers can make a decent living, it will be very difficult to get
decent facilities, especially in rural areas,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the afternoon, Clinton had a closed meeting with a
group of farmers who planned to talk to him about the importance of
pushing for changes in the Freedom to Farm law, with the soft
prices and bumper crops causing a repeat of the farm crisis in the
1980s, but with much less national attention.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was also to appear at two evening fund-raisers for Sen.
Tom Harkin, who said in an interview that it was important for the
president to come to Iowa to hear about the farm crisis firsthand.
``This is the worst I've seen,'' he said. ``It's worse now than in
the mid-'80s.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the Agriculture Department projected the
average prices for corn and soybean for this year at about half the
prices of only a few seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   With commodity prices falling below production costs, Harkin
said, an aid package for struggling grain farmers and livestock
producers was desperately needed. ``Every day we wait is going to
cost us more,'' he said.

FRENCH QUALIFIER IS OVER PAR, BUT AHEAD OF THE FIELD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Australia, Sweden)   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ The final four holes at Carnoustie may be
the toughest finishing holes in the world. Ask Greg Norman, who
triple-bogeyed No. 17 Friday. Or Tiger Woods, who bogeyed No. 16
and No. 18. But on the same holes where Norman and Woods faltered,
an unexpected leader emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Van de Velde, a 33-year-old Frenchman who won a Monday
qualifier just to earn a spot in the British Open, is leading the
tournament and living a dream. Shooting the best round of the Open
so far, a 3-under-par 68, Van de Velde was 1 over for the
championship after two rounds (143). He was also 1 stroke ahead of
Angel Cabrera of Argentina, who shot a 69 Friday, and 2 ahead of
Jesper Parnevik of Sweden, who shot a 71. Norman and Woods, who
will be paired Saturday for the first time in a major, were tied
for fourth place with Patrik Sjoland of Sweden at 4 over par. A
host of players will begin the weekend in contention, including
Justin Leonard (5 over) and Davis Love III (6 over).
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde became the first 36-hole leader at a major
championship to be over par since the 1974 United States Open at
Winged Foot Country Club in Mamaroneck, N.Y., when the leaders were
tied at 3 over par. Van de Velde had the highest 36-hole leading
score at the British Open since 1968 at Carnoustie, when Tony
Jacklin, Bob Charles and Brian Barnes shared the lead at even-par
144, when Carnoustie was par 72.
</P>
<P>
   However, the hopes of many players were answered Friday, as the
wind, which gusted to 30 miles an hour Thursday, subsided to 10 to
15 m.p.h. throughout the morning before increasing later in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Not that playing Carnoustie was easy. It never is. Rodney
Pampling, the only player to shoot as well as even par on Thursday,
became the first opening-round leader in British Open history to
miss the cut, falling apart today with an 86. But at least standing
on the tee box didn't feel like standing in front of an airplane
propeller. Friday's average score was 76.9, compared with 78.3 on
Thursday. Van de Velde, Cabrera, David Frost (69) and Costantino
Rocca (69) all broke 70, and players who were at their best showed
that it was actually possible to make birdies.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde saved his best work for last, making birdies at
both No. 16 and No. 18 to snatch the lead and to gain the golf
world's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I was not that nervous,'' said Van de Velde, who
could become the first player from France to win the British Open
since Arnaud Massy in 1907. ``I know it's a major championship, but
it's just a golf tournament. Now, I have to try not to do anything
silly. If it's my week, it's my week.''
</P>
<P>
   The week has been embarrassing for many of the world's best
players, who have lost their games and their composure on a
demanding course that can control your mind. The 36-hole cut was a
mind-boggling 12 over par, yet many of the game's top players did
not make it, including Phil Mickelson (13 over), Tom Lehman (14
over), the defending champion Mark O'Meara (15 over), Jose Maria
Olazabal (15 over), Steve Elkington (15 over), Mark Calcavecchia
(17 over) and Vijay Singh (19 over).
</P>
<P>
   Nick Faldo (15 over) missed his first British Open cut in 24
appearances Friday, shooting his highest Open round, a 79. The
five-time Open champion Tom Watson (13 over) was also rudely
dismissed. And 19-year-old Sergio Garcia's score looked like a
misprint: 30 over par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will try to forget this,'' said Garcia, who followed his
first-round 89 with an 83 Friday and finished last. ``I can't
remember when I last shot an 89. For the first time in 10 years, I
don't think I will watch the British Open on TV. I don't think it
deserves it. You have probably the toughest golf course in the
world and 12-yard-wide fairways. I almost hurt my wrist on No. 7. I
missed the fairway by 2 yards and it was unplayable.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Van de Velde danced around Carnoustie's potential trouble
like Fred Astaire, avoiding the engulfing rough, playing the
shifting winds to perfection and completing a beautiful round that
included 4 birdies and just one bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde has enjoyed a solid year on the European Tour, but
who expected this? Fatigued after Monday's qualifying event, he
played just one practice round at Carnoustie before Thursday's
first-round 75. Perhaps that was a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the place, because I played in the Scottish Open,''
said Van de Velde, who has two top-10 finishes in Europe this year
but has never contended in a major. ``I don't think the more you
play Carnoustie, the better you're going to play. The more you play
it, the more fairway you're going to miss, and the more you're
going to worry.''
</P>
<P>
   The highlights of Van de Velde's round came at the par-3,
250-yard No. 16 and the par-4, 487-yard No. 18. Van de Velde made a
45-foot putt for birdie at No. 16 that brought a huge roar from the
gallery. Then at No. 18, which played downwind, he hit a
magnificent 2-iron approach shot that nestled 3 feet from the cup
for an easy birdie and sole possession of the lead. Meanwhile,
Norman and Woods had tougher finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Starting the day at 5 over par, Norman made a vintage charge. He
was spectacular through the first 16 holes, playing them 4 under
par and leaving himself tied for the lead. But Carnoustie's
intimidating No. 17 _ par 4, 459 yards into the wind _ got the best
of Norman. His drive drifted just into the right rough, settling in
deep hay. Norman took a wedge and hacked at the ball on his next
shot. The ball barely moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either the club went underneath it, or the club never reached
the ball,'' Norman said. ``I don't think hitting a tee shot off the
fairway by 9 feet deserves something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   He hacked across the fairway into the left rough on his next
shot, hacked back into the fairway, hit an approach shot that
landed short, then chipped and putted for a 7.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Woods, who hit a 6-iron shot through the green at
No. 16, chipped to 15 feet, then missed the putt. At No. 18, his
8-iron approach shot also went over the green, and after his chip
to 10 feet, he missed another putt that would have saved par. Yet,
just 3 strokes off the lead, Woods liked his chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in very good shape,'' he said. ``This golf course is going
to penalize you whether you hit good shots or bad shots. It's just
the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   It will not change this weekend, which means almost anything
could happen with two grueling rounds to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you win or lose, we're playing some beautiful shots
that we really don't practice at all,'' Norman said. ``We'll
probably wake up Monday morning and say, `God, I had a lot of fun.'
But right now, in the heat of the moment, we don't like it.''
</P>

CATERPILLAR SEES PROFIT GROWTH SLOWING IN '99 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ After months of hinting at a turnaround, Caterpillar
Inc., the maker of construction and earth-moving equipment, warned
investors Friday that profit growth would continue to slide this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The warning came after Caterpillar said its second-quarter
profits had fallen 36.5 percent from a year earlier because of
slumping demand for heavy machines and equipment. It was the fourth
consecutive quarterly profit decline for Caterpillar.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Caterpillar fell 18} cents, to $58.9375, on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it had revised its outlook because sales of
more profitable machines and equipment, like mining trucks, dipped
while sales of less profitable equipment, like truck engines,
gained, upsetting the more favorable profit mix that had been the
basis for an earlier projection.
</P>
<P>
   Second-quarter sales were $5.1 billion, Caterpillar said, down
from $5.6 billion in the second quarter of last year, and profits
in the latest quarter were $283 million, down from $446 million a
year earlier. Earnings per share were 78 cents, slightly below Wall
Street expectations and down from $1.20.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said they were disappointed by the results
and by the company's warning, but several analysts said investors
were already looking ahead to early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caterpillar, at this point, is a 2000 story,'' said David
Bleustein, an analyst at Paine Webber. ``We expect the benefits of
the global recovery to more than offset any slowdown there might be
here in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   That turnaround, however, was expected to come earlier this
year. In March, Caterpillar executives sounded an upbeat note at a
convention in Las Vegas, saying signs of a recovery in Asia,
corporate belt-tightening and a push to diversify its business
could put the company on sound footing in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, the company pushed that optimism further out, saying
that it did not expect a big jump in profits until the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to fix this,'' said F. Lynn McPheeters, chief
financial officer at Caterpillar, which is based in Peoria, Ill.
``We thought the mix of business would turn a little earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Caterpillar says its warning grew out of a slowdown in
the sale of more profitable mining and oil exploration equipment,
the company pegged its yearlong profit slump to a recession in
parts of Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East and
weakness in the mining and oil exploration industry.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those problems, Caterpillar executives say the company
has made great strides in diversifying its mix of businesses,
noting gains in things like solar turbines, truck engines and
financial services.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue in 1998 was a record $21 billion, and this year the
company expects revenue to be slightly below that figure. Profits,
though, could be down 20 percent to 25 percent because of fierce
competition and the unexpected slump in some of the company's most
profitable products, the company said. Although profits dipped last
year to $1.5 billion, it was the third consecutive year the company
recorded a profit of more than $1 billion. Even with a sharp
slowdown, the company could still earn $1 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have profits that are down but reasonable, considering
the recession we've had in many of our businesses,'' McPheeters
said Friday in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the company had already seen a slight upturn
in Asia, the only region where sales gained from a year earlier,
and that Caterpillar had not yet benefited from a Federal highway
bill that recently went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would continue to benefit from cost
reduction put into place a year ago, and there are expectations for
a solid fourth quarter, with some analysts estimating a profit jump
of 40 percent or more from a year ago, when Caterpillar suffered a
steep decline.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts, though less optimistic in March than the
company was at that time, now say they believe the company's
fortunes will turn in 2000. While several analysts dropped their
third-quarter and year-end estimates, according to the First Call
Corp., which surveys analysts, no analyst altered a prediction for
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is being seen as a one-quarter problem,'' said Charles
Hill, director of research at First Call. ``This is a pretty mild
analyst reaction.''

and a monster V8 from Ford for muscle, the Panoz Roadster was bound
to turn a few heads. And of course, it graced the covers of
car-buff magazines with lots of pages to fill each year. But
curiosity quickly morphed into respect, with the early reviews

REVENUES CAN GROW WITH TAX CUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Capitalism's critics must have suffered a good deal of cognitive
dissonance as a result of efforts over the past two decades to
shrink capital gains tax rates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, pro-government liberals are generally happy
about anything that enhances government revenue. They are, however,
generally opposed to any tax break perceived to be inordinately
generous to the rich. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With capital gains tax relief, however, less has proved to be
more, which creates a problem for anyone framing the capital gains
tax debate in a class warfare context. The hard-core class
warriors, though, overcome their cognitive dissonance by pretending
that capital gains tax cuts neither add to Uncle Sam's coffers nor
enhance economic fortunes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some dismiss the latest GOP bid to ease the capital gains tax
bite as welfare for the country clubbers. The most comprehensive
initiative is that of House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer,
whose tax-relief package includes a proposal to pare the top
individual capital gains tax to 15 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The estimate of tax savings for those who would take profits
under the proposed lower rate is nearly $52 billion over 10 years.
Some critics use this number to justify their opposition, saying
affluent investors don't deserve this sort of government
generosity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a budget expert noted recently in The Wall Street Journal,
however, a cut in the capital gains tax rate is likely to increase
the capital gains revenue take rather than diminish it. At least
that's been the experience in the aftermath of previous cuts in
capital gains tax rates. Moreover, when the capital gains tax rate
was increased, revenue collections suffered. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies for the Cato
Institute, pointed out that as a result of the 1981 capital gains
rate cut from 28 percent to 20 percent, revenues from this tax
surged by nearly 50 percent from 1980 to 1983. Coincidentally, both
the recession and the bear market bottomed out in 1982. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Moore recalled, when the 1981 capital gains
reduction was sacrificed to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and the
capital gains tax rate went back up, capital gains revenues
plummeted. The $50 billion capital gains tax take of 1986, the last
year of the 20 percent rate, had fallen to $25 billion by 1991,
presumably due to the higher rate. Meantime, the economy went into
recession from mid-1990 to the spring of 1991. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the rate was returned to 20 percent in 1997, Moore said,
revenues from capital gains realizations surged again. Capital
gains receipts rose by 27 percent in 1997, and an analysis by
economist Lawrence Kudlow shows a two-year rise of 40 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for the collateral benefits of a lower capital gains rate,
Moore says one study credits 25 percent of the stock market's rise
of the past two years to 1997's capital gains tax relief. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The argument that capital gains tax relief benefits only the
rich is anachronistic. While it's true that the rich may benefit
more, growing affluence and the increasing investment pursuits by
average Americans have expanded the effects of capital gains
taxes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of relief include not only a lower tax burden, but
also the growth that makes the U.S. economy the envy of a
struggling world. &QL;

MINOR LEAGUES HAVE A PLAN WITH REPLACEMENT UMPIRES
</HEADLINE>
   (ko) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Faced with an implicit threat of an umpires strike of their own,
the minor leagues have made arrangements for replacements, a
high-ranking official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Pat O'Conner, vice president for administration for the National
Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, said that the minor
leagues would proceed with their ``normal course of business'' but
that presidents of the 16 leagues under the association were
instructed to have replacements ``available as needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The replacements may be needed as early as next week because
umpires from each minor league are scheduled to have a conference
call Monday with Richie Phillips, the Philadelphia lawyer who heads
the Major League Umpires Association and the newly formed Minor
League Umpires Association.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he and the umpires had a one-hour conference call
Friday and decided to talk again Monday. The umpires, who are
signed to individual one-year contracts, are expected to decide in
that call whether to walk out.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions involving the minor league umpires follow the
announcement three days ago by the major league umpires that they
would resign effective Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said minor league umpires were ``fighting a battle for
better pay and improved working conditions.'' He said umpires in
the lowest level of the minors earned $4,500 a year and received
$15 a day for meals. At the highest level, he said, the annual
salary is $12,500 and meal money is $20 a day.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, he said, the AHL, which is a minor league for the
NHL, pays officials a $41,000 starting salary and $59 a day in meal
money.
</P>
<P>
   O'Conner said a letter from Phillips that was received July 9
contained ``an implicit threat that some sort of job action might
take place. Based on that, we've made arrangements for
replacements.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that as a matter of course, each league had alternate
umpires available in case an umpire missed a game or was summoned
to work in a higher league.
</P>
<P>
   Triple-A leagues, like the major leagues, use a four-umpire
system. Double-A leagues have three umpires, and all other leagues
use two. Phillips has said 220 of 228 minor league umpires voted to
form a union. In his letter, O'Conner said, Phillips said he
represented the new union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good-faith doubt that claims Phillips made are
accurate,'' O'Conner said, ``and we've asked him to go to the
National Labor Relations Board and file a petition. If there's a
union certified by the NLRB, we have a commitment to deal with that
union in good faith.''

FLUSH BUSH TURNS TO SOFT MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa) (mk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although George W. Bush has amassed a huge
political war chest from small donations, he has apparently found a
novel way to give major Republican donors an opportunity to support
his campaign with large amounts known as soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Texas governor and candidate for the Republican
presidential nomination, bid a remarkable $43,500 earlier this
month to rent a prime spot to court participants in next month's
Iowa straw polls. But to pay that amount, Bush did not tap into the
$37 million he has raised in donations that are restricted by law
to $1,000 or less.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his campaign said Friday that the money was paid by six
donors, four of whom gave $10,000 and two who gave $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's perfectly legal,'' Karen Hughes, his spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hughes said the straw poll, to be conducted in Ames next
month, is essentially a fund-raising event for the Iowa Republican
Party. As such, she said, it falls under the part of the law that
allows donors to provide unlimited contributions for party-building
activities. Such donations are commonly called soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Stewart, the executive director of the Iowa Republican
Party, agreed. ``From our perspective it is a fund-raiser,''
Stewart said in an interview. ``We're well within the law in taking
these funds.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of Steve Forbes, a Bush rival, did not see it quite
the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Appell, a Forbes spokesman, accused the Bush campaign of
abusing the fund-raising rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``This raises a serious question about how ethical a Bush
administration would be,'' Appell said, ``especially when we know
he's raised a gazillion dollars from Washington special-interest
lobbyists.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the campaigns have leased space outside of Hilton
Coliseum in Ames to throw parties for supporters showing up for the
straw poll, considered an early test of candidate strength. Bush
secured the prime plot outside the arena after outbidding Forbes by
$600. Forbes wound up paying $8,000 for a smaller space, and other
candidates spent from $1,000 to $5,500.
</P>
<P>
   To cover Bush's bid, the Iowa party received pledges of $10,000
from Ray Hunt, Bradford Freeman, Heinz Prechter and C. Michael
Kojaian, as well as $5,000 donations from Louis Beecherl and John
Collins.

SEVERAL CITIES WILL CUT Y2K REPAIRS CLOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES and FINN BULLERS  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly half of the nation's 21 largest cities won't complete
work on their Y2K computer repairs until the final three months of
the year, according to a a congressional report released this
week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two cities, Dallas and Boston, have finished work to ensure that
their computers will continue to function on Jan. 1, 2000. Nine
others expect to be fully ready by Sept. 30, and 10 cities say they
will be ready between Oct. 1 and the end of the year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City is roughly 80 percent complete. Although not
included in the survey by the General Accounting Office, Y2K
coordinators in Kansas City say they will be ready by Oct. 1, at a
cost of $17.5 million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Don Eatherton, the city's Y2K coordinator, concedes that not
all departments will meet that target date. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Work at Kansas City International Airport won't be complete
until December. It's the same story at the Public Works Department,
where the greatest challenge is fixing 231 traffic signals with bad
software or clocks. Plan B calls for all signals to default to
four-way flashing red, or for four-way stop signs to be rolled out
at main intersections. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The city also reports that work at Metropolitan Ambulance
Services Trust won't be complete until Nov. 1. Of the 15 critical
areas to fix, none have been completed, the city reports at its Web
site _ {www.kcmo.org//y2k.htm}. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Y2K work is well under way at MAST, says Associate Director
Jim Jones. The ambulance service is awaiting software upgrades to
its billing and collection systems before it can be certified as
Y2K-compliant, he said. The upgrades are expected in September. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still on the Kansas City to-do list: securing backup generators
to power the airport for up to four months; developing new software
for animal licenses; completing wiring and testing of emergency
police fuel pumps; continuing to monitor emergency preparedness,
bioterrorism and communicable-disease responses; contingency plans;
and reconstructing the Mayor's Christmas Tree database for
charitable giving. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, federal agencies are generally thought to be in good
shape, but Y2K watchers in Washington are more concerned about the
efforts being made by state and local governments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas, Missouri and 44 other states entered fiscal year 2000 on
July 1 without big problems. Kansas City, too, experienced few
problems when it faced the 2000 fiscal year on May 1. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report noted that although most cities won't be totally
prepared until later in the year, many have made substantial
progress. El Paso, Texas, and Baltimore are the only cities
expecting December completion dates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cities saying they will be Y2K-ready by Sept. 30 are New York;
Houston; Philadelphia; San Diego; San Jose, Calif.; Indianapolis;
Jacksonville, Fla.; Memphis, Tenn.; and Milwaukee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those that will finish work in the final three months of the
year are Los Angeles; Chicago; Phoenix; San Antonio; Detroit; San
Francisco; Baltimore; Columbus, Ohio; El Paso; and Washington,
D.C. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's mission-critical contingency plans will be worked
on right up until Dec. 31. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who stops working on it and says they're done is a
fool,'' said Eatherton. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Russian roulette &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only one-third of Russia's vital computer systems are ready for
the millennium, and the government probably won't have the money to
fix the rest in time, officials said this week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finance Ministry officials told a Cabinet meeting that Russia
needs at least $187 million to prepare its computers for the Year
2000, reported the ITAR-Tass news agency. The figure was
dramatically lower than previous figures, which said Russia would
need $1 billion to $3 billion. The Finance Ministry did not explain
the discrepancy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, the money will be hard to find. Moscow probably will have
to give priority to defense and security sectors while withholding
money from other agencies, Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Russian government agencies have 28,000 vital computer systems,
one-third of which are Y2K-compliant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Russia plans to reduce the number of airplane flights Dec. 31,
halt some hazardous industrial processes and switch others to
manual control. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bug byte &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Irony of ironies. The prosecutor who hunts down bad checks in
Monroe County, Ind., is the same man responsible for issuing two
whopping rubber checks in June _ one for $50 million and another
for $49 million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blame the bug. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It seems the decimal point bounced around a bit after the county
installed new software designed to fix Y2K problems. The numbers in
the upper right-hand part of the checks were correct _ in this case
$50 and $49.01. But the wording ``fifty million'' and ``forty-nine
million'' appeared on the center lines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I dearly love this,'' said wrecker service owner Gary Koontz,
who is considering framing the check he received. ``I told my wife
we were millionaires for a day.'' &QL;

INDEPENDENCE, MO., WOMAN DETERMINED TO KEEP PET MONKEY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people stand up to City Hall. Mellisa Chapman danced around
it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Told by the city of Independence, Mo., that she had to get rid
of Lucy, her long-tailed macaque, Chapman decided to build a
separate house for the animal in unincorporated Jackson County. The
house is in a neighbor's yard, just beyond the Independence city
limits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By next week, Lucy should be in her own house. It's no dump,
either. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chapman is spending nearly $3,000 on an 8- by 8-foot structure
complete with a large cage, a skylight, air conditioning and a
television. Jungle wallpaper, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucy is a beloved family pet,'' she said. ``I couldn't just
give her to someone else.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   City and county officials say the new digs are legal, unless
Lucy returns to Independence for a visit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chapman knew when she bought Lucy that she couldn't keep a
monkey in Independence. So last year, her family moved to a house
with a Blue Springs mailing address. That city does not ban
monkeys. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The catch: Chapman's house is within Independence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Faulk, Jackson County's animal control officer, said he
had seen stranger pets than Lucy _ but not a stranger solution. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing to compare to this little facility she is
going to be erecting,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once Lucy moves, Independence will have no jurisdiction, said
Tom Heinkel, manager of the city's animal control department.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If that monkey is outside city limits...there is not much I
can say,'' Heinkel said. ``But if the monkey comes over to visit,
that's illegal.'' &QL;

ACTOR, DANCE, SEMINARIAN: A YOUNG MAN FINDING HIS PLACE IN LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POPPER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a hot summer day in 1997, Kent O'Connor, a young actor and
dancer then appearing in ``Gypsy'' at the New Theatre Restaurant in
Overland Park, Kan., had a strange experience with a familiar
song. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the time he was driving on Interstate 435 listening to a tape
of mixed music made for him by one of his brothers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the songs was one by REO Speedwagon that included the
repeated line, ``I can't fight the feeling anymore.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That line caught me so off guard I almost had to stop the
car,'' O'Connor said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For at the moment the song began, O'Connor was pondering the
resolution of a quandary that had begun in his childhood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It had begun with a feeling he could no longer fight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This summer O'Connor is appearing at the New Theatre, playing a
featured role in ``Hello Dolly.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But he is playing another role as well, and his photograph
appears not only in the theater program. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is displayed as well on the bulletin board at Holy Cross
Church in Overland Park. The wording beneath his picture there
identifies him as a seminarian and future Catholic priest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now living in the church rectory for the summer, O'Connor
devotes the time between stage performances to working with the
church's summer youth program. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, for example, he helped lead a group of
elementary-school children as they prepared for an upcoming musical
show. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He sang along as they rehearsed, and despite the fact that his
singing was subdued, his strong tenor voice reached from the altar
to the rear pew. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His is a trained voice, for although he is only 24, he has been
working in the theater for 17 years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When he was 7 and growing up in Topeka, when his mother asked
``if I'd like to be in the Nutcracker Suite. And I said, `Sure,'
without even thinking about it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He began dance training that year and soon was involved with
community theater, sometimes with as many as three productions at a
time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a busy kid,'' he said. ``I was always in dance classes
or rehearsals. And I loved it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He threw himself into performing with such vigor and elan that
his mother, Marilyn O'Connor, sometimes feared that he would hurl
himself off the edge of the stage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time his theatrical fervor began to blossom,
another seed was planted, one that grew more slowly but whose
roots, perhaps, went deeper. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 7 or 8, I was sitting in church as the priest was
talking about religious vocations,'' O'Connor said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember looking into a flickering candle in the sanctuary
and thinking, yes, I'll be a priest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't mention it to anybody, because I didn't really know
what it was all about. But I sensed it was a lasting commitment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``And that seemed strange to me, because my church life was
limited then. I did little except go to Mass. And yet that day I
began to feel something that has never gone away, and that I'm
still trying to understand.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While O'Connor was in high school, he began to believe that what
he was experiencing was a ``calling,'' an almost inexplicable
summons to the priesthood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I literally heard God call my name,'' he said
recently. ``It was more of a constant nagging in the back of my
head, an endless questioning: Am I on the right path? Is my life
going to be complete?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His mother, sensing something, joked that if he chose dance as a
career he could always become a priest when his legs gave out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But though he laughed, he still wouldn't talk about that idea
with anybody. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``For one thing, I wanted a social life,'' he said. ``And what
girl would date a guy who says he's going to be a priest?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the theatrical world still beckoned. And so instead
of entering a seminary, O'Connor went to the University of Kansas,
where he studied dance and theater. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During spring break in 1997, his senior year in college,
O'Connor traveled to New York City to try his luck in the
cattle-call world of theatrical auditions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I went with this funny notion that the theater actually needed
me,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His reception was positive, his talent recognized. After five
auditions he made the final cut for one show, was called back for
another, and received a job offer from a ballet company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But despite that success, he reached an unexpected conclusion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not doing anyone a big favor by being here,'' he thought.
``The theater will do just fine without me.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly frustrated with what he calls the ``self-centeredness''
of the dance world, feeling like a trained dog performing tricks,
he began to think he was wasting his other talents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was spending so much time training my body that my intellect
was going to pot,'' he said. ``Something important was missing. I
decided I needed to make a change in my life.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And so he attended a religious retreat in Atchison, Kan., and
then visited Mundelein Seminary near Chicago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with it,'' he said. ``I knew immediately it was
where I needed to be. And so I applied.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He soon discovered that simply applying to Mundelein, a seminary
devoted to training diocesan priests, is a rigorous process. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Every candidate first has to be approved by his own diocese,''
said Thomas Tank, a Catholic priest and vicar-general of the
Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``And that involves a twofold process of discernment. One is on
the part of the individual, who is counseled in ways to examine his
personal sense of calling.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The other, he said, is undertaken by church committees that
evaluate a number of qualities to determine whether the candidate
has the aptitude to serve the church. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All candidates go through extensive psychological evaluation and
are then screened by both diocesan and seminary acceptance
committees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After running that churchly gauntlet, O'Connor was finally
accepted and has now completed his first sequence of seminary
course work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not positive about my choice,'' he said this week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have four more years before taking any vows, and I may
discover I should be doing something else. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm in the right place. And I know that however it turns
out, the nagging question will have been answered.'' &QL;

COURTESY AND GRACIOUSNESS IN SHORT SUPPLY IN SENATE, ANALYSTS SAY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To hear some people talk Friday, members of that
exclusive and powerful club known as the U.S. Senate should pay a
visit to Miss Manners. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scholars and others who study or practice politics said at a
forum sponsored by the Robert J. Dole Institute for Public Service
and Public Policy that civility had declined in the Senate and that
deliberation was more rancorous. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Civility does make a difference,'' said Burdett Loomis,
interim director of the institute, which is based at the University
of Kansas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Civility will draw better people to politics and improve the
decision-making process, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some speakers at the daylong forum in a Senate office building
said senators today tended to be more partisan, publicly critical
of each other and more consumed with getting re-elected than with
working together. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Senators increasingly use filibusters and other divisive
maneuvers to stifle legislation, such as budget bills, speakers
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to confess to being worried and concerned about the
future,'' said Sen. Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican elected in
1996 after serving 16 years in the House. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately the tendency to fuss, cuss and fight rather than
discuss has become a reflex for legislators,'' Roberts said. ``Some
approach legislation almost like a campaign for election _ you
either win or lose. Debate suffers; policy suffers; people lose.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ten scholars submitted papers at the conference Friday on the
subject of civility and deliberation in the Senate. The Dole
Institute, which holds his congressional papers, will make a report
based on the scholars' papers and the forum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Loomis said Dole, the retired senator from Kansas, was an
example of civility and deliberation in the Senate of old. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He could get people in a room, get them to deliberate, get
them to decide and come out in a reasonably productive and civil
way,'' Loomis said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dole said the trend toward less civility and more deliberation
in the Senate was no surprise at a time when Senate debate is
televised live and when there is 24-hour news coverage of
politics. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are, after all, a representative democracy _ a mirror held
up to America,'' Dole told the gathering of about 50 persons
Friday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said there was nothing wrong with senators having
disagreements. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In a democracy, differences are not only unavoidable, (but) if
pursued with civility as well as conviction, are downright
healthy,'' Dole said. ``Put another way, I'd rather deal with
honest contention than creeping cynicism. Yet that's exactly what
afflicts our society today, when millions of citizens regard all
politicians as puppets on a string, dancing to the music of
spinmeisters.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said the decline in civility in the House and Senate
reflected a similar decline in society in general, an argument
several other speakers made Friday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Roberts said another reason might be that lawmakers do not
spend as much time getting to know each other as they did years
ago. Today, most of them go home every weekend and are in
Washington only when votes are taken. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many in Congress today do not develop close relationships
with colleagues and others in the policy process,'' Roberts said.
``They do not develop an appreciation of senators, let alone their
views on issues.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dole said he learned during his years in the Senate ``that an
adversary is not always an enemy.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keith Kennedy, former longtime staff director of the Senate
Appropriations Committee who is now in private law practice, said
partisanship was taking a growing toll on the Senate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are losing is productivity,'' Kennedy said. ``There
seems to be almost as much of a premium on being an obstructionist
as on producing something.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican who succeeded Dole, said
the Senate proved it could be civil and nonpartisan at the
impeachment trial of President Clinton last winter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All 100 senators met in private to work out a trial schedule and
then managed to hear the case with much less public bitterness and
partisanship than the House. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The impeachment trial actually built more communication,''
Brownback said. ``I think that trial was conducted on a civil,
bipartisan basis.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harry C. McPherson, former special counsel to President Lyndon
B. Johnson and now a partner in the Washington law firm where Dole
is employed, challenged the idea that civility and deliberation
were paramount. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters usually are not focusing on the most polite candidate
or the one who takes the most time making up his or her mind on
legislation,'' McPherson said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the greatest senators have been persons of such force
of personality, such power of will, such intellectual arrogance and
such irresistible energy that they were able to ram their work
through the ranks of much more polite and willful members. And the
nation benefited from that.'' &QL;

FRANCE'S SIMON IS STILL SECOND IN SIBLING RIVALRY  
(DW) 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. FLOUR, France _ Francois Simon has something that none of
his three brothers achieved as professional bicycle racers: the
blue, white and red jersey of the French national champion. But
they have something he has not yet achieved: a stage victory in the
Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Simon, who rides for the Credit Agricole team,
gave it his all Friday but fell short of the achievements of his
brothers Pascal (1982), Regis (1985) and Jerome (1988).
</P>
<P>
   He finished 25 seconds behind David Etxebarria, a Spaniard with
ONCE who completed the hilly 201.5-kilometer (125-mile) jaunt from
bucolic St. Galmier to the perched village of St. Flour. Etxebarria
was timed in 4 hours 53 minutes 50 seconds, or an average speed of
25 miles an hour in sunny and warm weather.
</P>
<P>
   The race's leaders let low-ranked riders gambol for the second
successive day, and there was only a small change at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong, the leader of the U.S. Postal Service team,
remained in the first-place yellow jersey by 7:44 over Abraham
Olano, a Spaniard with ONCE, who lost two seconds, and by 7:47 over
Alex Zuelle, a Swiss with Banesto.

NEWSPAPER COLUMNIST SUSPENDED FOR BUYING STOCK THROUGH FRIEND
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A San Jose Mercury News business columnist was suspended
indefinitely Friday for taking advantage of a friend's offer to buy
shares of a fledgling company at a price not available to the
general public.
</P>
<P>
   The columnist, Chris Nolan, told one of her editors about the
offer before she bought 500 shares of Autoweb.com at the initial
offering price of $14, but he offered no explicit approval or
disapproval, Ms. Nolan said. The columnist, whose ``Talk Is Cheap''
column focuses on the gossip of Silicon Valley's high-tech
industry, said she made about $9,000 by selling her stock in the
first two days after Autoweb.com first offered stock for sale to
the public in March.
</P>
<P>
   David Yarnold, the executive editor of the Mercury News, said
Friday that he felt ``she clearly placed us in a situation where
the public could perceive the Mercury News to have a conflict of
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's ethics policy forbids staff writers to ``make
news decisions about companies in which they have a financial
interest.'' It also stipulates that business writers should not
invest in local businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nolan's situation, which was first reported in The Wall
Street Journal, reflects the way quick profits from initial stock
offerings has become a routine part of Silicon Valley life. It also
shows the value of being invited to be one of the small group of
investors who can buy stock at the offering price.
</P>
<P>
   What has not changed, however, are newspaper and newsmagazine
ethics policies. They remain strict in forbidding business
reporters and editors from having any financial stake in the
companies they cover.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nolan's case troubles some because she did seek her editors'
guidance and permission. Ms. Nolan said in an interview that the
chief executive of Autoweb.com, Dean DeBiase, ``has been a friend
for many years'' and that ``I felt this was an offer from a
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nolan is a member of the local chapter of the Newspaper
Guild, and a union executive confirmed that he is investigating the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nolan also said Friday that she had also sold Fortune
magazine a first-person account of her experience with Autoweb.com,
a freelance arrangement that she said her editors had approved.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Yarnold said Friday night that while Ms. Nolan had mentioned
the article to editors ``in a passing way,'' she ``did not have
affirmative permission to sub-mit the article to Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   While some colleagues said there was some sentiment among
reporters that the editor's reactions were overly harsh, the one
reporter who spoke on the record, Jonathan Rabinovitz, the
economics correspondent, said: ``I like Chris. I think Chris is a
great reporter. But you don't do that. It's that simple.''

STATES SEEK TO PUSH FORWARD PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1976, the presidential campaign was so long and arduous that
a book about the race was titled ``Marathon.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The book on the 2000 race surely will have a different name _
like ``Sprint'' or ``Dash.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eager to wield influence in the nomination process, or just
excited about grabbing some of the big money that presidential
campaigns toss around, states are stumbling all over themselves to
schedule early primary dates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   California, tired of waiting until June to award its huge caches
of delegates, leaped to March 26 in 1996 but found out the race was
over by then. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next year, California will try March 7. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michigan wants to jump from March 19 in 1996 to a date in
February. Ohio is advancing from March 19 to March 7. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Iowa, which conducts the traditional kickoff, probably will move
its caucuses from February to January. New Hampshire, now slated
for Feb. 8, just adopted a new law allowing it to move to 1999 if
necessary to keep its first-in-the-nation primary status intact. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're committed to making sure we remain a week before any
other state,'' said New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, a Democrat pushing to advance Michigan's date,
thinks that's unfair. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``No state should be allowed to dictate that they go first every
time,'' he told The Associated Press. ``It's wrong.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in South Carolina and Delaware are looking at a Feb.
19 date, and Virginia may go to Feb. 29. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana, which held its largely ignored caucus even before
Iowa's last time around, may try to get out front again this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to, we'll be singing `Jingle Bells' while we're
selecting the next nominee,'' said Louisiana GOP Chairman Mike
Francis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely out of control,'' said Kansas Secretary of
State Ron Thornburgh about the rush to the front of the calendar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ridiculous,'' chimed in Massachusetts Secretary of State
William Galvin. ``The problem is, everybody can't be first. When
everybody is first, nobody is first and there is no process.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In all, about 15 states and territories wanting more say in
presidential selection are seeking to push forward, and how the
parties handle the crush remains to be seen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Missouri switched from a caucus to a primary for 2000, but kept
the same March date. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas did not have a primary in 1996; in 2000, its primary is
relatively late _ April 4. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nomination process, effectively over in about six weeks in
1996, could be over in four this time. By the end of February,
about 40 percent more delegates will have been chosen than by the
same time in the last elections. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Too fast, experts say. Voters don't have enough time to look
over the field. Candidates don't have enough time to learn about a
state or region. And what happens, some wonder, if a fatal flaw is
exposed in a front-runner a few weeks into the race? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans could face the prospect of being stuck
with a critically wounded candidate from March until Election Day
in November. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no chance for reconsideration,'' said Galvin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Others point to an even bigger problem. Candidates are being
forced to raise huge amounts of cash early so that they literally
can run a national contest and compete in all of the early states
at once. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, well-heeled candidates, such as Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, who recently reported raising more than $36
million, are deemed formidable although millions of Americans know
little about him. Others, such as Elizabeth Dole, Lamar Alexander
or Pat Buchanan, who trail far behind in the money race, are deemed
longshots. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some advisers to Alexander, the former Tennessee governor who
made a respectable showing in 1996, are now urging him to drop out
to save face _ long before a single vote is cast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And candidates who are not well-known nationally? Experts say
the days of a Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush or Bill Clinton
emerging from the pack may be over. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be Chicken Little and say the sky is falling,
but if this continues for another decade or two I really do think
democracy is at stake in the way we elect our presidents,'' said
Thornburgh. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The front-loaded nomination schedule is helping to turn a
seemingly innocuous event _ the Aug. 14 Iowa Straw Poll _ into a
significant political date. Normally a glorified fund-raising tool
for that state's Republican Party, the event is now viewed as make
or break for second-tier GOP contenders, who are said to have to
finish near the top or drop out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Iowa and New Hampshire cling to tradition, there's more at
stake in being first. Nearly one in five of New Hampshire residents
got to meet a presidential candidate and the tiny state saw more
than $200 million pumped into the local economy by the campaigns,
according to some estimates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the overvalued significance of Iowa and New Hampshire (69
Democratic delegates combined) was what irked California. Its 367
delegates represent more than 10 percent of those needed to win the
nomination, yet the state often ended up being irrelevant for
primary candidates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because California has moved to March 7, the same as New York
and 10 other states, some 30 percent of all convention delegates
will be awarded that day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, Republicans are tentatively planning their primary
for Feb. 22. The national Democratic Party, however, just nixed a
plan of Michigan Democrats to hold their caucus 10 days earlier.
When that party will hold its election next year is unclear. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After much hand wringing over the 1996 process, Republicans
adopted a system for 2000 that awarded bonus convention delegates
to states that held late primaries. Only three states took the
bait, and the plan has been viewed as a failure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now Jim Nicholson, the GOP National Committee chairman, who
complains that the current schedule is so compressed that ``it goes
off like a string of firecrackers once it starts,'' has appointed a
panel to look again at ways to spread out the process in 2004. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One plan backed by the National Association of Secretaries of
State calls for four regional primaries spaced about a month apart.
The schedule would rotate every four years to allow each part of
the country a chance to be first. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Iowa and New Hampshire would be allowed to remain first out of
respect for both states' political traditions and in appreciation
for the type of one-on-one, ``retail'' campaigning that candidates
must employ to win there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every state, however, would have to sign off on the idea. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a big fan of turning it over to Congress,'' Thornburgh
said. ``But if the next election cycle is as big a train wreck as I
think this one will be, Congress may be forced to take action.'' &QL;

NAACP SUES GUN MAKERS FOR SHOOTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joining a parade of cities and gunshot victims, the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Friday
filed the latest lawsuit that places the blame on gun makers for
shootings with illegally obtained handguns.
</P>
<P>
   But the action _ filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn and
naming nearly 100 gun manufacturers as defendants _ does not seek
monetary damages, as the other suits generally have. Instead it
asks the court to order the manufacturers to change marketing and
distribution practices that the NAACP says foster an underground
market in illegal handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Among the gun makers named are some of the biggest in the
country, including Smith &AMP; Wesson, Colt's Manufacturing, and Sturm,
Ruger &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The group asked the court to prohibit gun wholesalers and
retailers from selling more than one handgun to the same person in
any 30-day period.
</P>
<P>
   It also asked that the manufacturers be ordered not to supply
dealers who sell handguns at gun shows, where, critics of such
shows say, regulations of gun sales are often skirted. And the suit
asks that the gun makers be ordered to conduct quarterly
inspections of their wholesalers and retailers to insure compliance
with the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The steps are needed, the civil rights group contends, because
the manufacturers have been ``failing to regulate, supervise and
otherwise exercise reasonable control over the marketing,
distribution and sale of their handguns.'' Because of this failure,
the group says, many of the guns eventually end up in the hands of
illegal traffickers who sell them to ``criminals, juveniles, the
mentally ill'' and others not authorized to have them.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed for the NAACP by the law firm of Weitz &AMP;
Luxenberg. The court papers say that the NAACP, which announced
this week that it would file the suit, is bringing the action ``to
protect the well-being and security of its membership, which has
been disproportionately injured'' by illegal handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NAACP is particularly concerned about the level of handgun
violence in African-American communities,'' the court papers say.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for one defendant, Glock Inc., said that the
allegations underlying the suit were baseless. In any case, said
the lawyer, John F. Renzulli, a court is not the place in which to
seek the kind of changes the suit asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would appear to me that the relief they are requesting
should be directed to the Legislature and not the court,'' Renzulli
said. ``When you are talking about restrictions like one sale a
month'' to individuals, ``isn't that something that should be
debated in the Legislature?''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, more than a dozen cities and counties have
filed suits against the gun industry that generally seek to recoup
law enforcement and hospital costs stemming from gun violence. And
in February, in the same court where the NAACP filed its suit
Friday, a jury in a precedent-setting verdict ordered several gun
makers to pay more than $500,000 to a Queens teen-ager, Steven Fox,
who was shot and severely wounded with an illegally obtained
handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Although the gun used in that shooting disappeared, the jury
found that the companies _ which all make .25-caliber guns like the
one that ballistics evidence indicates was used to shoot Fox _ were
collectively liable because of negligent marketing and distribution
practices. The verdict is being appealed.

FEAR OF ATTACK CANCELS COHEN'S TRIP TO ALBANIA
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defense Secretary William Cohen canceled a trip to
Albania this week, in part because of fears of a terrorist attack
there by followers of Osama bin Laden, Clinton administration
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials would not say if there was evidence of a
particular threat against Cohen, but they said Albania had long
been seen as a potential terrorist staging area because of the
presence of followers of bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of
masterminding the bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have said the United States foiled a
plot last August by Islamic militants loyal to bin Laden to attack
the U.S. Embassy in Tirana, the Albanian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of visiting Albania, where he had been expected to meet
with U.S. troops serving near the border with Kosovo, Cohen
traveled to Bosnia, where he spoke to American soldiers serving in
the peacekeeping mission there.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with reporters on his return to the United
States after a six-nation trip to Europe, Cohen was asked if the
threat of an attack had played a role in the decision to cancel his
visit to Albania. The defense secretary acknowledged there had been
security concerns but said they were not the sole reason for the
cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always taken into account the threats,'' Cohen said.
``That is why we have such security wherever we go.'' He said the
``principal reason'' for the decision to shift the trip to Bosnia
was the presence of so many American soldiers ``who have served
there so long.'' Many of the U.S. troops now assigned to Albania
have been in that country only a short time and will soon leave.

GRAND JURY REFUSES TO INDICT MAN IN AN ASSISTED SUICIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn.)  (af) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Manhattan grand jury has declined to indict an
Upper East Side veterinarian who admitted to the police last fall
that he injected a dying colleague with a fatal dose of
phenobarbital at her request, a day or so before she was to be
moved from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center into a hospice.
</P>
<P>
   The veterinarian, Dr. Marco Zancope, would not comment, except
to express his gratitude. But his lawyer, Robert G. Smith, called
the grand jury's refusal to indict his client ``a breath of common
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about Jack Kevorkian here,'' Smith said.
``He was drawn into a situation; she was ravaged by cancer and
asked someone to help her.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision also drew praise from George Delury, a New York
writer and editor who was also arrested for assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thankful the grand jury had more sense there,'' said
Delury. He eventually pleaded guilty to attempted manslaughter and
served four months in jail for giving his wife, Myrna Lebov, who
suffered from multiple sclerosis, lethal amounts of drugs and
suffocating her with a plastic bag in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan district attorney's office sent out a terse
statement, saying the grand jury had arrived at its decision after
listening to 48 witnesses. District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau
could not be reached, and press officers at the office would not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Zancope was accused of hastening the death of Cara Beigel, 33,
his office manager and friend, as she lay in a hospital bed,
terminally ill with the breast cancer she had struggled with for 13
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was in tremendous pain and agony,'' said Phillip Beigel,
her father, a retired television producer and businessman from
Connecticut, in an interview shortly after Zancope's arrest last
October. ``She said, `I don't want to carry on like that. It's
over, it's over.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Beigel could not be reached at his home in Connecticut Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a videotaped statement to police, Zancope said he injected
the barbiturate into an intravenous drip tube that fed into Ms.
Beigel's arm on Aug. 28, 1997. Zancope said he was ``solely
responsible'' for administering the drugs. Law enforcement
officials say he was alone with her at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Zancope told the police that her family and friends were aware
of her decision to end her life and had gathered by her bedside
shortly before her death. In the October interview, Beigel
indicated that the veterinarian had acted in accordance with his
daughter's wishes, saying: ``If Cara could have, I think she would
have done it herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Though very few cases are reported to law enforcement officials,
medical experts say that many terminally ill people seek help in
ending their lives, especially people who, like Ms. Beigel, are in
intractable pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it happens frequently,'' said Marilyn Webb, whose
book, ``The Good Death: The New American Search to Reshape the End
of Life'' explores the legal and moral aspects of
physician-assisted suicide. ``These are rational decisions people
make. Doctors quietly help people. It has to do with `don't ask,
don't tell.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, she said, the decision is made in secret, a painful,
private pact often involving the dying person and some combination
of family members, close friends and a trusted doctor.
</P>
<P>
   In Delury's opinion, a major reason that Zancope was able to win
the sympathy of the grand jury was the support he had from Ms.
Beigel's family. ``The whole family backed him,'' he said. ``I
didn't have that.'' Also, he said, Ms. Beigel was terminally ill,
in the final stage of cancer, whereas Ms. Lebov would probably not
have died from multiple sclerosis for years, though it might have
left her blind and paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Zancope's role in the death of Ms. Beigel went undetected, or at
least unreported, for nearly a year. He was arrested after the
medical examiner's office received a report from officials at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering that phenobarbital, a drug frequently used
to euthanize pets, had been found in a toxicology report from an
autopsy performed five months before. It is not clear what caused
the delays.
</P>
<P>
   Avice Meehan, a spokeswoman for the hospital, would not comment
on the grand jury's decision.

 RONALD YURCAK, JUNK BOND TRADER, DIES AT 57  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NICK RAVO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ronald N. Yurcak, a pioneering junk bond trader at Salomon
Brothers who later worked closely with Michael R. Milken during
Drexel Burnham Lambert's heyday in the late 1980s, died Tuesday. He
was 57.
</P>
<P>
   Yurcak suffered a heart attack in his car after jogging near his
home in Far Hills, N.J., his wife, Marilyn Chin, said.
</P>
<P>
   Yurcak attended Rutgers University on an athletic scholarship
and was an all-American lacrosse player; he graduated in 1965. He
was an Air Force captain and a navigator in the Vietnam War and won
the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross and other medals.
</P>
<P>
   Impressed with his military background, Ross Perot, the founder
of Electronic Data Systems Corp., the computer-services company in
Dallas, hired Yurcak in 1971 as a systems engineer. Yurcak also
worked as Perot's personal assistant and in the brokerage
subsidiary of EDS. He later moved to Kidder Peabody &AMP; Co. and to
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co..
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Yurcak went to Salomon Brothers, where he started and
managed the high-yield bond trading and sales department.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was instrumental in moving Salomon into this area,'' Milken
said, ``and this was a significant achievement because Salomon was
known for its high-quality bonds, and it was a big culture
change.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Yurcak moved to Drexel Burnham Lambert in Beverly
Hills, Calif., where Milken had moved the firm's junk bond
operations, which he headed.
</P>
<P>
   There Yurcak was one of eight traders who sat at the office's
X-shaped desks, buying and selling billions in junk bonds, which
are debt securities issued by corporations with poor credit
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   After the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert, Yurcak went to
work for a succession of financial companies in the United States
and in Hong Kong: Greenwich Capital Markets, Paine Webber, NJP
Services and most recently Miller Tabak Hirsch.
</P>
<P>
   An active alumnus of Rutgers, he was named two weeks ago to the
Rutgers University Foundation Board of Overseers. He also helped
build its soccer and lacrosse field, which was named the Ronald N.
Yurcak Field in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Yurcak is survived by his mother, Pauline
Yurcak of Edison, N.J., and two daughters, Jennifer Yurcak and
Patricia Jessica Yurcak, who uses the name P.J., both of Far Hills.

 GEORGE E. BROWN Jr., 79, DIES;  CONGRESSMAN FOR 18 TERMS  
(af) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. George E. Brown Jr., an 18-term California
Democrat who used his seniority and influence to promote science in
general and space exploration in particular, died early Friday in
Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland. He was 79 and lived in San
Bernardino, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Brown had heart valve replacement surgery in early May and
seemed to recover, returning to work part time only days afterward.
But in mid-June he was re-admitted to the hospital with what his
office described as a post-operative infection.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who represented California's 42nd Congressional District,
which consists of most of San Bernardino and several other
communities east of Los Angeles, was chairman of the House Science,
Space and Technology Committee from 1991 until the Republicans took
control of the House in 1995. He then became the ranking minority
member of the renamed science committee. He was also the
second-ranking Democrat on the agriculture committee.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was the oldest current member of the House and the
longest-serving member of the House or Senate in California
history, his office said. In the nearly 35 years that he served in
Congress, Brown was generally liberal on domestic issues. He
opposed U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia and
consistently voted against military-spending bills in the last
years of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his political longevity, Republicans thought he was
vulnerable in recent elections. Brown was re-elected in 1992, 1994
and 1996 with slim majorities. By far his toughest victory was that
of 1996, when his opponent was Linda Wilde, a superior court judge
and wife of a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilde campaigned on a law-and-order platform, accusing the
congressman of being soft on crime and lax on efforts to change the
welfare system. He replied that he had worked hard to put more
police officers on the streets and fight drug abuse, and he
ridiculed her opposition to gun control with a radio advertisement
featuring staccato gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown nearly self-destructed while debating his opponent.
``I imagine Linda, because she is a lady, is afraid of math,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not at all, replied Ms. Wilde, who had taken advanced statistics
courses in graduate school. Brown sheepishly apologized. He won by
996 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, against a less formidable opponent, he won
comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was a friend of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. Although he leaned toward unmanned space
exploration, he fought efforts to cut money for the space station.
</P>
<P>
   But he strongly opposed military uses of space. In the early
1980s, he spoke out loudly and often against President Ronald
Reagan's ``Star Wars'' plan to build a space-based defense against
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Brown supported creation of the Environmental Protection Agency
and development of solar energy and alternative fuels.
</P>
<P>
   A Quaker who served in the Army in World War II from 1944 to
1946 after initially objecting on religious grounds, Brown spoke
out against the confinement of Japanese-Americans early in the war,
when he worked in a Civilian Conservation Corps camp in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was born in Holtville, Calif., 10 miles north of the
Mexican border, and graduated from the University of California at
Los Angeles. He was a management consultant before winning election
in 1954 as a councilman in the Los Angeles suburb of Monterey Park.
He became mayor the next year, then won election to the state
assembly.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to Congress in 1962 from a district encompassing
much of East Los Angeles, and re-elected three times before running
against Rep. John V. Tunney in the Democratic senatorial primary in
1970. Brown derided his opponent as the ``lightweight son of the
heavyweight champ,'' but he lost.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, after the post-census reapportionment created a
new congressional seat close to his childhood home, Brown was
returned to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A special election will be held to fill the remaining 18 months
of his term.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is survived by his wife, Marta; two sons, David and Dale;
four stepsons, Samuel, Armando and Miguel McQueen and Howard
Cincotta, and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

SEC CIVIL SUIT SAYS FAXES ABOUT 12 STOCKS WERE FALSE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ill., Fla., N.Y.)   (ko) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the sort of thing that would grab some investors'
attention: a letter mistakenly faxed to them _ written on
Prudential Securities stationery and marked ``confidential'' _
predicting that shares of three companies would soon triple because
``major announcements are coming out this month.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission say
there was no mistake. The letter was bogus, they said, and faxing
it was an attempt by stock manipulators to dupe investors.
</P>
<P>
   The commission filed a civil lawsuit on Thursday in federal
court in Miami accusing Globus Group Inc. of Miami and its
principal, Anthony DiMarco, of fraudulently promoting the shares of
a dozen tiny, thinly traded companies, known as micro-caps. The SEC
officials said DiMarco, who used to be known as Bruce Gorcyca, is a
former Internal Revenue Service agent who served more than three
years in prison in the 1980s after pleading guilty to bribing a
public official and making fraudulent statements to the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, SEC officials said, DiMarco has been sending faxes that
trumpeted stocks to unsuspecting people. They said he created bogus
documents _ made to appear as if issued by leading securities firms
including Prudential, Citibank Global Asset Management and Merrill
Lynch _ predicting that the shares of 12 companies would climb. He
also issued false news releases for six of the companies, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also accused DiMarco and Globus of offering
investments through a Web site that fraudulently stated that the
investments were ``authorized by the U.S. government,'' carried
little or no risk and would generate returns of 17.5 percent to 35
percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   DiMarco and Globus officials did not return a call to one number
seeking comment. At a second number, a woman who answered the phone
said they had moved out.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the 12 companies, Trans-Global Holdings of Des Plaines,
Ill., and China Food and Beverage of Kew Gardens, New York, were
also sued by the SEC, which accused them of allowing false news
releases without seeking to correct them.
</P>
<P>
   John Lamonica, Trans-Global's chief executive, said his company
was getting into the time-share business and had hired Globus ``to
tout our company.'' He said the SEC charges were not true. ``We
certainly didn't do anything wrong, and we certainly didn't lie,''
he said; he was not named in the SEC complaint.
</P>
<P>
   A Trans-Global director whom the commission did sue, Jacques
Verhaak, said, ``We don't think we've got a problem here.''
</P>
<P>
   China Food's chief executive, James Tilton, who was also sued by
the SEC, said, ``I don't know of anything that we did that could
have brought something like this on.'' He said the company owned a
brewery in China.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 other companies whose stocks the SEC said were promoted
were: Tmanglobal.com, North Wave Communications, Lasertec
International, Chill Tech Industries, Micromem Technologies,
Converge Global Juniper Group, LaJolla Diagnostics, Aquagenix and
Top Image Systems. They were not named in the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said U.S. District Judge Alan S. Gold in Miami had
issued a temporary restraining order Friday prohibiting Globus and
DiMarco from violating the antifraud provisions of federal
securities laws and freezing their assets.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, July 16 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: BREAST
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 55-45, an amendment to larger
health care legislation that would require managed-care plans to
cover a woman's stay in the hospital following breast cancer
surgery. Supporters said it would ensure that her medical need will
dictate how long a woman stays in the hospital after undergoing
surgery. Opponents said the amendment does not go far enough in
giving women options concerning treatment for breast cancer. A
``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: ACCESS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday rejected, 48-52, an amendment to larger
health care legislation that would ensure that the so-called
``Patients' Bill of Rights'' applies to all patients with health
insurance. Supporters said that it would give all insured patients
access to the rights they deserve. Opponents said expanding the
rights to all patients would only raise insurance premiums. A
``yes'' vote supports the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: SPECIAL
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday rejected, 47-53, an amendment to larger
health care legislation that would give patients easier access to
specialty care. Supporters said there are too many hurdles between
patients and the specific care they may need. Opponents said the
amendment would increase health care costs and interfere with the
rights of states to set their own health care regulations. A
``yes'' vote supports the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: PATIENTS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 53-47, a Republican-sponsored
``Patients' Bill of Rights'' that gives 48 million people expanded
rights when dealing with their health insurance providers by
setting up an appeals process when care is denied. The bill also
provides easier access to emergency room medical specialists and
enables women to stay in the hospital longer after breast cancer
surgery. Supporters said the bill improves health care without
raising insurance premiums. Opponents said the protections are not
strong enough and do not cover enough people. A ``yes'' vote favors
the bill.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: MINING
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 273-151, an amendment to the
Interior Department spending bill that would limit mining on
federal lands by requiring companies to heed the 1997 Interior
Department ruling that limits the disposal of mining waste to five
acres. Supporters said mining operations need to be limited on
federal lands. Opponents said the amendment is yet another assault
on the mining industry and that the Interior Department does not
have the jurisdiction to make such laws. A ``yes'' vote supports
the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: RELIGION
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday passed, 306-118, a bill that protects
religious activities from government interference. The bill
protects an individual's right to follow their religious practices
even if it violates state or local laws. Supporters said the bill
will stop the erosion of religious freedoms that is taking place
across America. Opponents said the bill would let people use their
religious practices as an excuse to subvert other civil rights
laws. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: SALARY
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday passed, 276-147, a measure that would
raise House members' salaries by $4,600. The amendment, which
increases members' salaries to $141,300, is the first time
lawmakers have raised their salaries since 1993. The amendment
sparked little debate on the House floor. A ``yes'' vote favors the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: PRESIDENT
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 82-334, an amendment to the
Treasury and Postal Service spending bill that would have stricken
a provision to double the president's salary to $400,000.
Supporters of raising the salary said the president, who has not
received a raise since 1969, deserves it because he has the most
important job in the country. Opponents said the president's
current salary is adequate because the job has many perks. A
``yes'' vote opposes giving the president a raise.

WOMAN IN SERVITUDE CASE WAS CLEARED IN '88 INQUIRY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JACQUES STEINBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A New York City child abuse investigator accused this
week of keeping a Nigerian girl in servitude was exonerated in a
1988 investigation of possible neglect involving a second Nigerian
girl, child welfare officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator, Ifeoma Ezeonu Udogwu, was named in a complaint
of possible child abuse in 1988 after fire marshals investigated a
fire in her home which the second girl was suspected of starting,
fire officials have said. The marshals called a state child-abuse
phone line, suspecting that the girl, then 13, whose identity has
not been made public, was not properly supervised and not enrolled
in school, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials began investigating the complaint in August 1988
_ soon after the fire, and soon after the hiring of Ms. Udogwu as a
caseworker at the city's child welfare agency.
</P>
<P>
   The case was closed six months later, in February 1989, after
investigators interviewed the girl and determined that the
marshals' concerns were ``unsubstantiated,'' said Leonora Wiener, a
spokeswoman for the agency, now known as the Administration for
Children's Services. ``She asserted that she was not being
mistreated and that she was doing well with the family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wiener said child welfare officials were still trying to
piece together the records regarding the 1988 complaint and did not
yet know whether the investigators had spoken to anyone other than
the 13-year-old girl in pursuing the accusations. At some point the
girl is believed to have returned to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wiener said it was not clear whether the girl started the
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Udogwu, who is in her 30s, and her husband, Prosper Udogwu,
48, were charged on Wednesday with keeping Beatrice Okezie, a
Nigerian who is now 23, in forced servitude in their Bronx home for
nine years and beating her. Lawyers for the Udogwus deny the
charges and cite records showing that Miss Okezie, who graduated
from Evander Childs High School in the Bronx in 1994, had an
attendance record of better than 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Udogwus, originally from Nigeria, are accused of luring her
into the United States in 1989, when she was 13, by promising to
send her to trade school, only to force her to work as their
unpaid, live-in maid, according to a complaint filed in U.S.
District Court here.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News reported Friday that an anonymous letter alleging
abuse against Miss Okezie had prompted child welfare officials to
investigate Ms. Udogwu again in 1992, a case in which she was also
cleared. A person with knowledge of that case, who insisted on
anonymity, confirmed that account, but would provide no details.
Ms. Wiener said her office had yet to unearth any information
related to that complaint or its outcome.

GOP CONGRESSMAN EXPECTED TO DEFECT TO DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rep. Michael Forbes, a Long Island, N.Y., Republican
who has regularly found himself at odds with his party leaders in
Washington, is expected to defect to the Democratic Party,
Democrats in Washington and New York said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The highly unusual defection creates a complication for
Republicans _ who hold a six-seat majority _ as they prepare for
elections next year in which control of the House of
Representatives is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who was elected to Congress in 1994, told Democratic
Party leaders in New York and Washington Friday that he would
disclose his decision at a news conference in Suffolk County, Long
Island, Saturday afternoon. He refused Friday night to discuss his
intentions with a reporter, other than to acknowledge that he had
scheduled a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is all kind of speculation out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reported defection by Forbes, who observed his 47th birthday
Friday, comes after what has been three years of up-and-down _
though mostly down _ relations with Republican leaders in Congress.
He was the first Republican to oppose Newt Gingrich's selection to
a second term as House speaker in 1996, an act of defiance that
poisoned his relations with many of the party's most influential
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, even given Forbes' difficult history, the notion
that an experienced politician would leave the party that controls
the House baffled both Republicans and Democrats in New York and
Washington on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't figure it out,'' said one astonished House Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes reportedly decided to make the change after intense
lobbying over the last 18 months by Reps. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the
minority leader in the House, and Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Rangel, who is from New York City, declined to
say whether Forbes had agreed to switch parties, saying that it was
``an extremely private matter'' that should be left to the
congressman to announce.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very sensitive decisions and it takes a lot of time
and courage to make these decisions,'' Rangel said. ``I will say
that I have become increasingly aware of the discomfort of many
Republican members of the New York delegation to the right-wing
dogmatism of their leaders and the attempt to whip into line all
Republicans whether they agree with their leaders or not.''
</P>
<P>
   While a Republican defection would move congressional Democrats
closer to their goal of regaining control of the House, there were
indications Friday night that some Democrats in New York were not
in complete agreement on what Forbes might add to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is generally viewed as conservative, even in Republican
circles. He is opposed to abortion rights and has voted against
many gun control measures. He also voted in favor of the articles
of impeachment against Clinton last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one that would be done holding our noses,'' a senior
New York Democratic official said. ``When you have a pro-gun,
pro-life, pro-tobacco, pro-articles-of-impeachment congressman,
that's not quite the Democratic way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Judith Hope, the Democratic state chairwoman,
expressed cheer at Forbes' anticipated announcement. ``We welcome
him into the Democratic Party,'' she said. ``It's a bellwether of
what's going to happen in the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been growing sentiment among Democratic officials in
Suffolk County that they might be able to defeat Forbes in an
election next year.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Bullock, a former Suffolk County legislator who is chief of
staff to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., had been considering
seeking the Democratic nomination to run against Forbes next year.
As soon as he learned of Forbes' planned news conference, Bullock
called a reporter to make clear that if he could not run against
Forbes in a general election, he was more than prepared to
challenge him in a Democratic primary.

KC SCHOOL BOARD, DEMPS AGREE ON CONTRACT PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Benjamin Demps Jr. reached agreement Friday night with the
Kansas City Board of Education on a two-year contract worth about
$200,000 annually. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Board members voted 7-1 with one abstention to approve the
11-page agreement, which includes an annual base salary of
$156,420. Demps could earn $17,380 more each year if he meets
certain performance goals, such as improving student test scores
and attendance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over,'' board member Connie Clark shouted, raising her
hands in triumph shortly after the vote. ``This has been a trying
time for the board and for Mr. Demps. We need to take a long, deep
breath and contemplate what lies ahead.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court-appointed Desegregation Monitoring Committee must
still approve the deal, and Demps won't sign until after that.
Board members did not know when the committee would act, but they
expected it to do so before a court hearing scheduled for 10 a.m.
Monday before U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charles McClain, a member of the monitoring committee, declined
to comment late Friday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   School board members said they wanted to introduce Demps to the
judge at the hearing. Demps would not make any community
appearances until after the hearing, they said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A selection committee spent months identifying and interviewing
applicants before recommending four finalists to the school board.
Demps was the third person to be offered the job in the past three
weeks. The two others _ retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Jay T. Edwards
and former U.S. education commissioner Pascal Forgione Jr. _
withdrew after they could not agree on a contract. The other
finalist, Grandview superintendent John Martin, also withdrew. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Board members Clark, Lee Barnes Jr., Lance Loewenstein, Sandy
Mayer, Helen Ragsdale, Terry Riley and John Rios voted for the
contract. Board member Patricia Kurtz voted against. Board member
Fifi Wiedeman did not attend the meeting at the offices of
Blackwell Sanders Peper Martin, a law firm for the district. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The vote ended a day of discussions between district lawyers and
Demps over contract language. Demps also received about a four-hour
briefing on the status of the desegregation lawsuit and court
orders aimed at improving academic performance in the district. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Board members then spent about an hour in private, reviewing the
proposed contract. About 7:15 p.m. Demps entered the meeting. The
doors opened a few minutes later, and board members surrounded
him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz, the board's vice president, said Demps had the
``confidence, support and blessing'' of the school board. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Demps said that he was looking forward to working with the board
and that he was excited to get started. He declined to comment
further and was quickly escorted from the room. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Demps, 65, is a retired Federal Aviation Administration official
who also served as director of the Oklahoma Department of Human
Services in the early 1990s. The Harlem native is semiretired and
living in Oklahoma City, where he operates an aviation consulting
business. He is married and has two grown children. He said his
wife, a lawyer, intended to stay in Oklahoma City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz, who cast the lone dissenting vote, said she was concerned
whether Demps' personality, which she described as somber, would be
a good fit for Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the district is a sick entity that needs healing and
uplifting,'' she said. ``I don't sense an energetic spirit. Maybe
it's there. I just didn't see it in the interviews.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She also said she thought Demps became the superintendent by
default. But she said she would do everything she could to support
him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ragsdale said she understood Kurtz's frustration with the
selection process. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They can continue to be disgusted at the process _ so am I,''
said Ragsdale, who served on the candidate screening committee with
the three-member monitoring committee. ``It's been a long struggle
to bring forward someone qualified and that this board could
accept. But now we need to concentrate on educating the
children.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his base salary and incentives, Demps would
receive a car allowance up to $600 a month, and the district would
pay $12,000 into a tax-sheltered annuity. The district would also
provide a $300,000 life insurance policy and pay a disability
insurance premium of up to $5,000 annually. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Demps would be eligible for annual raises of no more than 5
percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He would receive 20 days of sick leave and 20 days of vacation.
He would be required to take an annual medical exam. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The district hired Henry Williams as superintendent in 1996 at a
base salary of $164,500 plus benefits that brought the package to
about $190,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous superintendents, Demps got no days to do
independent consulting work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Demps got the board to remove language giving it final approval
over all appointments at the department director level and above.
Demps must consult with the board before such selections but does
not need its approval. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Board members said they would immediately begin compiling a list
of goals for Demps. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mayer thanked the judge for extending the school board's
deadline for naming a superintendent. She said the extra time
allowed board members to visit Oklahoma City this week to meet with
Demps' associates, co-workers and others. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found out,'' she said, ``is that this is the man that
we need at this time.'' &QL;

FOR TRUMP, A RACE SO SHORT AND SWEET  
 IN SEARCH OF A FIGHT ...  
 ... AND STUMBLING INTO ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ It was one of the shortest presidential
campaigns in history.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a Democratic polling firm released a survey of
members of the Reform Party showing Donald J. Trump tied for third
place among its possible nominees for president. Then on Sunday,
puffing up a single paragraph from its new issue, Newsweek put out
a news release with the headline, ``Friend: Trump Thinking about
Reform Party Nomination for President.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump says he had given no thought to the possibility, but he
decided to play along. On Monday, he issued his own news release,
lauding the Reform Party, founded by Ross Perot, and criticizing
the two major parties. ``If the Reform Party nominated me, I would
probably run and probably win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   News organizations around the world ran with the story. A
headline in The Washington Post said, ``Trump Ready for Call From
Reform Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility was especially delicious in Connecticut, since
Trump had a boisterous feud with a former governor, Lowell P.
Weicker Jr., who is seriously considering seeking the Reform Party
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1994, when Trump wanted to build a casino in the state,
Weicker referred to Trump as ``that dirt bag,'' and Trump called
Weicker ``a fat slob who couldn't get elected dog catcher.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Trump-for-president stories proliferated, Trump, a
Republican who also supports Democrats, finally decided he had had
enough fun. He has never been known for subtlety, but his statement
did include the sentence, ``If I won, I would ask for an immediate
recount.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth, he said by telephone from the 68th floor of Trump
Tower in Manhattan, is that he has no plans or desire to run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so unlikely that you shouldn't bother asking the
question,'' he said. ``I'm honored and I'm flattered, but the fact
is I've never had more fun than I'm having right now, building the
most spectacular buildings in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in his inimitable style, he went on to enumerate why he
would be a formidable candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Weicker, on the other hand, is pressing ahead with his Reform
Party exploration, and said he would make a decision about whether
to run in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He disclosed Friday that he would not attend the Reform Party
convention in Michigan next weekend. Although party leaders have
said that attending would elevate his standing among members, he
said he did not want to be become embroiled in the leadership fight
to be hashed out at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not touching that with a 10-foot pole,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Search of a Fight ... &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Curry, a Democrat who has been a Connecticut state senator
and the state comptroller, plans to announce a new campaign before
summer's end. But what to run for?
</P>
<P>
   He is torn, he said, between a bid for governor in 2002, and a
challenge next year to Rep. Nancy L. Johnson, the nine-term
Republican from the sixth district.
</P>
<P>
   Either race could wind up being a rematch for Curry, who lost
narrowly to Mrs. Johnson in 1982 and to John G. Rowland in the 1994
governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   The state has no term limits for a governor. Rowland, a moderate
Republican who is broadly popular, says he has not decided whether
to run for a third term, but many Republican leaders doubt he will.
</P>
<P>
   Curry, of Farmington, is one of the few prominent Democrats who
have been willing to criticize Rowland publicly on any topic,
including his generous stadium deal with the New England Patriots,
which ended in humiliation for the state when the team walked away
in April. (``If John Rowland had been at Yalta,'' Curry would say
with relish, ``we'd all be speaking Russian.'')
</P>
<P>
   Curry, 47, said he planned some intense soul-searching in a few
weeks, after he finishes a book _ a combination of memoir and
policy critique _ about his two years in the White House as a top
political adviser to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Curry already has a catchy, if debatable, story line for a
congressional race: ``Former presidential adviser runs against
impeachment-voting Republican impostor.'' But he added, ``What's
always been in my heart has been the governorship.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ... And Stumbling Into One &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Michael P. Peters of Hartford, a former city firefighter,
is hoping to win a fourth term this fall, but he faces at least one
challenge at a Democratic nominating convention on Thursday. He has
rocky relations with the city's minority groups, and 10 billboards
around town promote his challenger as ``Leadership for the Next
Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Then last week, Peters was served with a lawsuit by a former
city council aide who accused him of discussing sexual acts he
would like to perform on her, ``placing his hand under her dress on
one occasion'' and displaying Playboy magazines in her presence.
</P>
<P>
   Peters, 50, issued a statement calling the allegations
categorically untrue. But the case has received heavy news
coverage, and the timing could be politically costly.
</P>
<P>
   The challenger with the billboards, Juan A. Morales, 34, said
the issue should help bolster points about credibility and morality
he had long planned to make at the convention. ``Bring your
football helmet and shoulder pads,'' he said gleefully.

HEAT IS ON U.S. TEAM AS AUSSIES WIN TWO
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. _ The Australians wore ponytails and white
war paint under their baseball caps, immune to the 126-degree
swelter on the hard courts and to the dress code at the
122-year-old Longwood Cricket Club.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Rafter and Lleyton Hewitt, along with the green-haired,
yellow-faced fans they call the Fanatics, were not here to make a
fashion statement Friday. And they were immune to the desperate
attempts of Jim Courier and Todd Martin, on whose behalf Pete
Sampras benched himself, to prove their worth as the United States
singles players for the weekend's Davis Cup quarterfinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every match is historic, mate, in Davis Cup,'' Rafter said
after downing Courier, the Davis Cup iron man, who has never played
for a losing squad in 13 previous appearances, to give Australia a
2-0 lead over the United States.
</P>
<P>
   This was a Davis Cup centenary celebration in which the most
celebrated star who was present sat out while two lesser lights _
both of whom had done more for the United States' Davis Cup cause
lately _ fought valiantly but ineffectively. The host nation was
left facing elimination in the best-of-5-match format, which
continues Saturday when Sampras and Alex O'Brien face Australia's
Mark Woodforde and Sandon Stolle in doubles.
</P>
<P>
   The only time a U.S. Davis Cup squad recovered from such dire
straits was 1934, when the Americans came back to defeat Australia
by 3-2; overall, the United States is 1-28 when facing a deficit
like the one that Hewitt and Rafter inflicted on them Friday.
</P>
<P>
   First came a swaggering Davis Cup debut from the 18-year-old
Hewitt, a scrambler whose 6-4, 6-7 (1-7), 6-3, 6-0 demolition of
Martin reduced the American veteran to an immobile puddle of
perspiration by the final set. Then the second-ranked Rafter, whose
two U.S. Open titles make him a perfect fit for these hardcourts,
smoothly served and volleyed his way past the pugnacious Courier,
7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Though Rafter described their first-set tie breaker as ``a
comedy of errors'' in which the returner wielded all the power, he
won it with a service winner and then kept his momentum intact by
breaking Courier in the ninth games of the second and third sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologically it can get tough out there if you get down in
all that heat,'' Rafter said. ``It was brutal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter described his teammates as ``very up'' and added: ``Not
going to get any better than this. We want to try to do this
three-nil.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter felt that Hewitt benefited from facing Martin, and not
Sampras, at No. 1 singles. But Sampras remained a sanguine
cheerleader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice enough for Jim and Todd to let me be a part of the
team; it is Todd's show and Jim's show,'' Sampras said.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, in a make-or-break doubles encounter that will
clinch the competition for Australia or prolong it until Sunday for
the reverse singles, it will be Sampras' show.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can keep us alive,'' said Tom Gullikson, the U.S. captain,
who reiterated that his decision to use Sampras for doubles was
only a matter of principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't see how he can walk out there and believe he can
play good doubles,'' said Woodforde, Australia's doubles anchor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously he's a great player, but I much prefer to see him
across the net in doubles than in singles,'' said Stolle, a regular
partner of Alex O'Brien's, Sampras' doubles teammate for this cameo
appearance in the quarterfinals. ``I don't think Pete is as
comfortable playing doubles. We will see on the day how he plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Sampras, 3-1 in Davis Cup doubles, plays the hero
Saturday and rescues the United States from its predicament, Martin
implied that the team would sink or swim on Sunday with him and
Courier, the same singles players who delivered the United States
to the quarterfinals by upsetting Britain in round one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all where we feel like we should be, and go about our
business,' Martin said. ``If we're good enough, we're good enough,
and if we're not, better luck next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin admitted that until the team held its final meeting this
week, he felt Sampras was a lock for a singles slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the decision was made for me to play singles, and I wanted
to play,'' Martin said. ``As for what everybody else thinks, I
don't know how to put it without digging myself a bigger hole. If
Pete weren't the initiator of all this, yeah, sure, then I'd be a
little bit uneasy. As soon as I hit the first ball today, I forgot
Pete wasn't playing singles; it was all just my match.''
</P>
<P>
   To be more accurate, it was all Hewitt's match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Lleyton is one of the few people in tennis with very,
very, very great nerves; he sees big occasions and he attacks
them,'' Martin said. ``It's like Pete. One of the reasons Pete is
such a great player is he has got fabulous nerves.''
</P>
<P>
   But they went to waste today.

 JUDGE RULES FOR BLACK PARENTS IN EMBRYO MIX-UP CASE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A justice of the state Supreme Court in Manhattan
ruled Friday that a black baby who was born to a white Staten
Island woman after an embryo mix-up at a fertility clinic belongs
in the permanent custody of his biological parents.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Diane S. Lebedeff ruled that the biological parents,
Deborah Perry-Rogers and Robert Rogers, a black couple from
Teaneck, N.J., should have custody of the 8-month-old boy they have
named Akiel.
</P>
<P>
   The baby's birth parents, Richard and Donna Fasano, had filed
suit to force the Rogerses to live up to a visiting agreement. Mrs.
Fasano gave birth to the boy and to her own biological son last
December after a Manhattan fertility clinic mistakenly placed
fertilized embryos from both couples in her womb. The Fasanos said
they wanted the two boys to know each other as brothers, and they
had reached a visiting agreement with the Rogerses before they
turned the boy over in May.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Fasano and her lawyers contended in court that the boy
should be considered both her son and Mrs. Perry-Rogers' son. But
Justice Lebeduff ruled Friday that the Rogerses were the sole
parents. Lawyers for the Fasanos said they would not contest the
judge's decision.
</P>
<P>
   But one aspect of their dispute remains unresolved. In a
short-term victory for the Fasanos, Lebedeff ruled that the two
babies should visit each other for four hours every other week for
the next two months. During that period, psychologists chosen by
each couple will determine whether the two boys formed links as
``brothers'' during nine months in the womb and five months in the
Fasanos' home.
</P>
<P>
   The Fasanos have claimed that the two infants reached out to
each other during visits, and contended that they should maintain
contact as they grow up. Lawyers said the psychologists would
determine whether the visits were constructive or destructive based
on the infants' body language during and after the visits.
</P>
<P>
   Lebedeff scheduled a hearing on the visits for Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The justice thanked both couples, and tried and to put the best
face on a difficult case. ``I've talked with both sets of
clients,'' Lebedeff said. ``All four are very impressive people and
I'm struck by how they've handled a very difficult situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But outside the courtroom, the two sides continued to snipe over
what, exactly, was the relationship between Mrs. Fasano and the
baby she had carried for nine months. Ivan Tantleff, the Fasanos'
lawyer, insisted she had a tie to the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call them whatever you want,'' he said. ``The boys
were brought into life by Mrs. Fasano. Whatever legal terms you
want to say, she'll always in her heart feel she is the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rudolph Silas, the Rogerses' lawyer, said the biological
mother was the child's only true mother. Mrs. Rogers, he said, was
unfairly punished for a clinic's error.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone made a terrible mistake,'' he said. ``To diminish Mrs.
Rogers' right as a parent as a result is not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Both families have filed negligence lawsuits against the
fertility clinic involved, IVF New York. A state inquiry released
in April found that the embryologist, Michael Obasaju, knew that
another couple's embryos were being implanted in Mrs. Fasano's
womb, but failed to inform anyone at the time or move to correct
his mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits accuse Obasaju, the clinic and two other
physicians, Dr. Lillian D. Nash and Dr. Dov B. Goldstein, of
malpractice, negligence and breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   The state inquiry found that soon after Obasaju told Nash of the
mistake in May 1998, she informed both couples. The dispute over
what happened next continued Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Rogerses again accused the Fasanos of having
avoided contact with them after learning that one of the children
Mrs. Fasano was carrying might not be hers. They said the Fasanos
had agreed to discuss the matter only after the Rogerses filed a
lawsuit in March seeking custody of the child.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Fasanos denied any wrongdoing. After DNA tests
showed the baby belonged to the Rogerses, the Fasanos turned the
child over to them in May, and both sides agreed to have him spend
one weekend a month with the Fasanos.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the Rogerses said the visits went awry when Mrs.
Fasano insisted on calling the baby by the name she had given it _
Joseph _ and on referring to herself as the boy's ``mommy'' when
speaking to him. They said such conduct would not be tolerated
during future visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly object to that,'' Silas said. ``We will fight that
to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   But both sides expressed the hope that the intense publicity and
turmoil surrounding the case would now subside and that the two
children would be allowed to grow up in peace. Douglas Reiniger,
another lawyer representing the Fasanos, said their only remaining
wish was that the two boys remain in contact.
</P>
<P>
   Silas said the Rogerses, too, were interested in moving forward.
If their psychologist concludes that visits between the two boys
are beneficial, he said, the Rogerses will not object. ``If they
say it's truly in the child's best interest,'' he said, ``we're all
for it.''

PAK   MANAGES TO MAINTAIN HER LEAD AND HER COMPOSURE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Korea)   By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. _ By the time Se Ri Pak reached her final
green Friday, the crowd had grown at least five deep on every side.
After a bogey that left her with a one-stroke lead in the Japan
Airlines Big Apple Classic, she was pushed through the gallery by
security guards. A crowd of Asian journalists waited, and then a
long session with the American news media.
</P>
<P>
   But Pak smiled her way through it, just as she had her missed
putt on the ninth green. The pressures that came with being a
mythic figure back home in South Korea before she turned 21 no
longer haunt her. She smiles, accommodates the crowds and goes back
to her hotel to prepare to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   For the second day in a row, Pak headed the field at Wykagyl
Country Club, following up a 66 in Thursday's first round with a 69
Friday and maintaining her tenuous lead. Two of the LPGA Tour's top
players, Karrie Webb and Meg Mallon, made rushes and were among
four players in second place at 6-under par. Even though a pair of
bogeys in the final three holes reduced her cushion, Pak maintained
an air of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am getting more confident,'' Pak said. ``I think I am
getting closer and closer. That's why I am here. Win or not, I
don't need to push myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday, the tournament's biggest crowds had been for the
U.S. women's soccer players Mia Hamm, Julie Foudy and Brandi
Chastain. But Pak knows what it is like to be the center of
attention, after winning a pair of majors in a dominating rookie
season last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people say I am, in my country, more than Michael Jordan
is here,'' Pak said. ``I didn't know that until someone told me.
Last year, after the win, I'd wear a different hat, clothes,
glasses, try to make myself not like Se Ri, but still people know.
It's pretty amazing. Sometimes it's pretty good. I go to a
restaurant and they make me special food.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, it seemed as if the pressures might ruin Pak
as she struggled on and off the course. She fired her coach and
business manager and did not crack the top 10 in her first 12
tournaments. But Pak, who speaks regularly with her father, who has
been the biggest influence on her performance, and who was joined
here this week by her sister, did not crack. She hired the
International Management Group to handle her off-course affairs and
slowed the pace of her hectic schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Pak remained confident that success would come again. It has,
with a fourth-place finish in the Wegman's Rochester International,
her first victory of the season at the Shoprite LPGA Classic, a
seventh-place finish at the McDonald's LPGA Championship and then
another victory in the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic.
</P>
<P>
   She remains focused on the task at hand. On Thursday she said,
``Every week is the same: golf course, hotel, dinner, golf course,
hotel, dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a schedule she will keep this weekend, too.

M. LAWRENCE NOYER JR., WHO PROSECUTED BROTHER OF D'AMATO, DIES AT
40  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Conn.)   By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   M. Lawrence Noyer Jr., a former federal prosecutor who headed
the mail fraud case against Armand P. D'Amato, the brother of
former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, died July 7 at the Albert Einstein
Medical Center in the Bronx. Noyer, who lived in Larchmont, N.Y.,
was 40.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a pulmonary embolism, his mother, Mary Noyer,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Noyer was best known for his four-year-long investigation of
Armand D'Amato, a Long Island lawyer and the younger brother of the
senator. Armand D'Amato was convicted in 1993 of mail fraud, but
the conviction was later overturned on the ground of insufficient
evidence. Senator D'Amato was never a defendant in the case, which
nonetheless prompted a two-year Senate Ethics Committee
investigation of allegations that he engaged in influence peddling.
</P>
<P>
   Noyer was born on Aug. 11, 1958, in Manhattan, a son of Maurice
L. Noyer, a lawyer, and Mary Noyer, a real estate broker. A 1980
graduate of Georgetown University, Noyer was editor of the law
review at Fordham Law School and a clerk for Joseph McLaughlin,
then a judge for the Eastern District.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Noyer joined the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern
District, where he spent eight years. In 1994, he returned to
private practice, and eventually became general counsel of Barclays
Bank PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Noyer is survived by his mother, Mary Noyer of Westhampton
Beach, N.Y.; his wife, Pamela Davis; a son, Griffin; a daughter,
Claire; his brother, Charles Noyer of Larchmont, and four sisters,
Christine Seaver of Palo Alto, Calif., Elizabeth Feld of Plandome,
N.Y., Mary Ann Noyer of Westport, Conn., and Nadine Rote of
Larchmont. &QL;

AGREEMENT AT LAST IN ALBANY ON $73 BILLION BUDGET DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Three-and-a-half months after the state budget
was due, legislative leaders and Gov. George E. Pataki have agreed
to the outlines of a $73 billion deal, legislators and top aides
said Friday. The plan would salt away $1.8 billion to pay for
future tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, and the Senate majority
leader, Joseph Bruno, told legislators Friday to return on Monday
to convene conference committees to draft a detailed budget over
the next week or two.
</P>
<P>
   The news follows one of the most rancorous iterations of what
has become a uniformly rancorous process. For months, Silver has
accused the governor of sacrificing New York's needs to his
ambitions for national office, while Pataki has charged that the
speaker was trying to spend so much that the state would rack up
huge deficits and have to forgo promised tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time, a state law provides that
legislators' salaries will be withheld as long as the budget is
overdue, adding friction to an already heated atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Legislature passed a spending plan that pleased
nearly everyone, only to have the governor veto $1.6 billion worth
of items in it, most of them programs prized by the Democrats. That
experience cast a long shadow over this year's budget talks, with
Silver determined not to repeat it.
</P>
<P>
   This week's breakthrough, officials said, rested in part on
Pataki's assurances that he would not make widespread use of his
veto pen this year _ though some vetoes remain likely _ as long as
the Legislature remains within the agreed-to boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative leaders had agreed weeks ago to spend about $1.1
billion more than Pataki proposed in January, but the governor had
indicated that their figure was a few hundred million dollars too
high. In the last few days, Pataki agreed to the $1.1 billion in
additions, but how one arrives at that number relies heavily on
widely varying estimates of what some programs will cost, and he
insisted on calculating more conservatively than Silver had hoped.
There is still no accord on precisely how to reach that number, and
officials warned that the agreement could fall apart on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki appears to have achieved one of his two primary goals for
this budget: the state's $1.8 billion surplus from the fiscal year
that ended March 31 will be saved, not spent, to ensure that the
state will have enough money to absorb tax cuts that are already in
law, and are to go into effect over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether he reached his other goal, to keep the
spending increase under the rate of inflation. It is an important
claim for a man who would like the national Republican Party to
consider him for the vice president's spot on next year's ticket
and who, after last year's 6 percent overall spending increase, is
trying to reassert his credentials as a fiscal conservative.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Pataki called for a 1.8 percent increase. Officials
are saying the budget outline that the leaders have agreed to raise
spending by more than 3 percent. But state lawmakers routinely
overestimate expenses when drafting budgets.

EDITORIAL: BREAKING A GUN-CONTROL BARRIER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, July 17:
</P>
<P>
   A group of about 95 Colorado teen-agers visited the Capitol this
week to talk about the shootings at Columbine High School and the
need for more stringent restrictions on firearms. They left with
the unmistakable impression that the Republican-led Congress has
yet to grasp the devastation caused by gun violence. Fortunately,
the Democratic presidential contenders do grasp the problem.
Marking a possible turning point in the gun-control debate, Vice
President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley have offered
gun-control plans that go beyond anything being considered by
Congress and even beyond the sound but limited measures put forth
by the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Braving a longstanding political taboo, the two contenders have
begun to broach the core issues of gun licensing and registration.
Last week Bradley laid out an agenda that includes a ban on the
cheap handguns known as ``Saturday night specials,'' a requirement
that all would-be gun purchasers first pass a safety course and
obtain a license, and another that all guns be registered with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Gore stopped short of Bradley's call for universal gun
registration. Instead he proposed a new system of photo licensing
and testing for handgun purchasers, and a system that requires
dealers to report the serial numbers of all handguns sold, in order
to help police trace guns used in crimes. But presumably the names
of the purchasers would not be furnished, so the police would still
have to rely on gun-shop owners to do any records searches _ a
potentially time-consuming step that Bradley's full-fledged
registration plan would avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Gore apparently believes that his plan will be more palatable to
voters in those states where the National Rifle Association is most
influential. But the NRA cares little for such differences. It has
already attacked Gore's plan as a step toward an all-out handgun
ban.
</P>
<P>
   The existing system for regulating guns is an inefficient
patchwork. National polls show that there is extensive support for
the dramatic changes that both Democratic candidates have now
endorsed, and the Gore and Bradley camps are betting that it is
good politics to respond aggressively to the widespread hunger for
real reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican front-runner, George W. Bush, has so far taken
another approach. Portraying himself as a moderate, he has
nonetheless backed the watered-down gun-show provision offered by
the NRA's friends in Congress. He recently signed a measure in
Texas to bar localities from suing gun manufacturers for
irresponsible marketing practices. Bush says such suits are based
on exotic legal theories concocted by greedy lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, these suits have applied traditional negligence
standards to hold gun makers accountable for the damage caused by
their products _ a point U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein
underscored in his recent ruling upholding last spring's jury
verdict against gun dealers in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley have added something new to the Democratic
race. They have also made it harder for Bush to ignore the strong
popular support for strict gun control.

METS,   9, DEVIL RAYS, 7, AS REED HOLDS ON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Luck must be on Rick Reed's side this
season because he sure hasn't been all that good.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-game winner a year ago, Reed earned his seventh victory
Friday night after the Mets hung on to beat the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays, 9-7, at Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   In his first game after the All-Star Game break, Reed (7-3) was
hoping for a fresh start. Instead, it was more of the same problems
that plagued him during the first half of the season: inconsistent
control, untimely hits, another big home run.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Reed won, as the Mets (52-39) improved to 25-11 since
June 6.
</P>
<P>
   Reed allowed eight hits and five runs in six innings. The
33-year-old right-hander squandered leads of 3-0 and 5-3, but the
Mets' offense, which banged out 15 hits, kept bailing him out.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza had three hits and drove in two runs, and Matt
Franco hit a two-run home run. But the Mets' offense really turned
on the tandem of Rickey Henderson and Roger Cedeno.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, batting leadoff, and Cedeno, hitting ninth, combined
for five runs, five stolen bases, three walks, four singles and a
double.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno's two steals give him 50 in the Mets' 91 games, tying him
for third most in a season in franchise history. Lance Johnson
stole 50 bases in 1996, and Mookie Wilson stole 54 in 1983 and a
club-record 58 in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Henderson stole three bases Friday night. It
was the first time he had done so since Sept. 7, 1997, and he has
27 steals for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The two have hit top and bottom the last two nights thanks to
the designated hitter in the American League park. Henderson even
drove in Cedeno with the go-ahead run in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   That was fortunate for Reed, who has a 4.96 earned run average,
which is almost a run and a half worse than his ERA last season,
when he struggled the final month.
</P>
<P>
   Reed's signature, his pinpoint control, has been anything but
precise this year. After issuing a pair of walks Friday night, Reed
has walked 34 in 98 innings, more walks than he gave up in 1998 (29
in 2121/3 innings) and 1997 (31 walks in 2081/3 innings).
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he analyzed his problem. ``I really think it's just
been mechanics,'' said Reed, who allowed a two-run, game-tying
homer to Herbert Perry in the fifth. ``One game, I've got it. The
next game, I don't. If I could just string together two or three
good games, that might get me on a roll.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Mets to make a run at a post-season berth, they will
probably need just that.

LAWMAKERS BACK SUING OF CON ED  
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Lawmakers from both major parties have proposed
legislation that would make it easier for New York City to sue
Consolidated Edison over the power failures that darkened upper
Manhattan last week.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration filed a
lawsuit against Con Edison, seeking to recover the costs of
providing additional police officers, firefighters and other city
employees during the blackout. The administration also accused the
utility of gross negligence.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear how the courts will respond to the suit. The
state's highest court ruled in 1984 that Con Edison did not have to
pay the city the roughly $20 million that it was seeking in a
similar lawsuit for the additional police and fire protection it
provided during the blackout of 1977, during which riots and
looting broke out.
</P>
<P>
   It cited litigation involving the 1979 reactor accident at the
Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania and other cases in
ruling that there was no explicit legislative action authorizing
recovery of such public expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   So lawmakers here in the state capital are seeking to insure
that the city's current lawsuit moves ahead, proposing legislation
that would require all utilities to pay for additional public
services that are provided during power failures resulting from
``gross negligence.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill's main sponsors are leaders from both parties: Assembly
Speaker Sheldon Silver and Guy J. Velella, the senior deputy
majority leader in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Velella, who represents part of the Bronx, said the legislation
would remove the most significant legal hurdle to the city's
lawsuit against Con Edison. He said taxpayers should not be
required to pay for additional city services that were needed as a
result of the utility's failure.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Liipfert, a spokeswoman for Con Edison, declined to
comment on the matter, saying she had not reviewed the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 people in upper Manhattan lost power at the
height of an intense heat wave last week, when underground power
lines that bring electricity from substations to the neighborhoods
failed and several power lines caught fire. Con Edison said it was
forced to shut off all electricity north of 155th Street in
Manhattan.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, July 16 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: BREAST
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 55-45, an amendment to larger
health care legislation that would require managed-care plans to
cover a woman's stay in the hospital following breast cancer
surgery. Supporters said it would ensure that her medical need will
dictate how long a woman stays in the hospital after undergoing
surgery. Opponents said the amendment does not go far enough in
giving women options concerning treatment for breast cancer. A
``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: ACCESS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday rejected, 48-52, an amendment to larger
health care legislation that would ensure that the so-called
``Patients' Bill of Rights'' applies to all patients with health
insurance. Supporters said that it would give all insured patients
access to the rights they deserve. Opponents said expanding the
rights to all patients would only raise insurance premiums. A
``yes'' vote supports the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: SPECIAL
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday rejected, 47-53, an amendment to larger
health care legislation that would give patients easier access to
specialty care. Supporters said there are too many hurdles between
patients and the specific care they may need. Opponents said the
amendment would increase health care costs and interfere with the
rights of states to set their own health care regulations. A
``yes'' vote supports the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: PATIENTS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 53-47, a Republican-sponsored
``Patients' Bill of Rights'' that gives 48 million people expanded
rights when dealing with their health insurance providers by
setting up an appeals process when care is denied. The bill also
provides easier access to emergency room medical specialists and
enables women to stay in the hospital longer after breast cancer
surgery. Supporters said the bill improves health care without
raising insurance premiums. Opponents said the protections are not
strong enough and do not cover enough people. A ``yes'' vote favors
the bill.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: MINING
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 273-151, an amendment to the
Interior Department spending bill that would limit mining on
federal lands by requiring companies to heed the 1997 Interior
Department ruling that limits the disposal of mining waste to five
acres. Supporters said mining operations need to be limited on
federal lands. Opponents said the amendment is yet another assault
on the mining industry and that the Interior Department does not
have the jurisdiction to make such laws. A ``yes'' vote supports
the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: RELIGION
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday passed, 306-118, a bill that protects
religious activities from government interference. The bill
protects an individual's right to follow their religious practices
even if it violates state or local laws. Supporters said the bill
will stop the erosion of religious freedoms that is taking place
across America. Opponents said the bill would let people use their
religious practices as an excuse to subvert other civil rights
laws. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: SALARY
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday passed, 276-147, a measure that would
raise House members' salaries by $4,600. The amendment, which
increases members' salaries to $141,300, is the first time
lawmakers have raised their salaries since 1993. The amendment
sparked little debate on the House floor. A ``yes'' vote favors the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: PRESIDENT
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 82-334, an amendment to the
Treasury and Postal Service spending bill that would have stricken
a provision to double the president's salary to $400,000.
Supporters of raising the salary said the president, who has not
received a raise since 1969, deserves it because he has the most
important job in the country. Opponents said the president's
current salary is adequate because the job has many perks. A
``yes'' vote opposes giving the president a raise.

COETZER DEFEATS KOURNIKOVA AT A&AMP;P CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
 (ko) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAHWAH, N.J. _ Amanda Coetzer ignored the pleas of a partisan
crowd yelling encouragement for Anna Kournikova Friday night, and
with a steady game won, 6-4, 6-4, to advance to the semifinals of
the A&AMP;P Tennis Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Coetzer, at 5 feet 2 inches, is 6 inches shorter than
Kournikova, but she does not give up on her shots.
</P>
<P>
   And while the 19-year-old Kournikova is 9 years younger than
Coetzer, she was unable to develop a power game Friday. Her
forehand strokes were not formidable enough to allow her to charge
the net.
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova also appeared to be in physical distress most of the
evening. She bent often to stretch her legs, or squatted as if she
was trying to stretch her muscles. After the match she received
medical treatment, and did not appear at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had severe dehydration,'' said John Korff, the event's
director. ``She practiced a lot today and has cramps from both her
feet to her whole body. They're giving her lots of fluids.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather was in the 90s during the day when she practiced and
in the 80s when the match began. Still, it was uncomfortable for
spectators, let alone players.
</P>
<P>
   It almost seems as if Kournikova brings her own cheering section
_ young men who root for the tall and tanned Russian teen-ager. One
group of four shirtless young men, in fact, spelled out her first
name, each with a letter emblazoned on his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Kournikova's popularity, Coetzer said with a smile,
``Nobody painted my name on their chest.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Coetzer, a South African, overcame Kournikova, though
Kournikova nearly forced a third set. She was down, 5-1, in the
second set when Coetzer began to tire. Or perhaps Kournikova
finally began to hit winners instead of the unforced errors that
hounded her through much of the match.
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova pushed Coetzer to five match points before losing.
Coetzer faces Chanda Rubin on Saturday in one semifinal, while
Jennifer Capriati meets Erika deLone in the other. DeLone toppled
Nicole Pratt, 7-5, 7-6 (7-1), Friday. The first semifinal starts at
noon.
</P>
<P>
   Coetzer said she was hitting the best strokes of her life right
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm among the oldest players,'' said Coetzer, the world's
ninth-ranked player, ``and what keeps me going is the fact I
haven't reached my full potential. I've made some racquet changes
and over the last few months I'm hitting the ball harder.''
</P>
<P>
   This event used to count toward the WTA Tour point standings but
became an exhibition in 1990, when Steffi Graf won it for the
fourth time.
</P>
<P>
   Graf, who won her sixth A&AMP;P Tennis Classic title last year,
returned to her home in Florida Friday after her withdrawal because
of illness in a quarterfinal match with Capriati on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Graf's agent, Phil de Picciotto, said Graf was still suffering
from the effects of bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is no more serious than it was,'' de Picciotto said of
Graf's condition.
