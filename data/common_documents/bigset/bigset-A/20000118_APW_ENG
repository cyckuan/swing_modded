<HEADLINE> Stranded Dolphins Helped Tut to Sea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAYTON, Fla. (AP) -- Divers and snorkelers formed a quarter-mile-long human
chain to help push about 20 stranded dolphins back out to sea after the mammals
became trapped in shallow water off one of the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
	   Rescue efforts concluded late Monday off Long Key, with all of the dolphins
clear of the shore and rescuers hoping they would stay in deeper water, said
Lisa Henley, an officer with the Florida Marine Patrol.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 23 bottle-nosed dolphins died after becoming stuck in tidal flats
Sunday night during low tide, said Steve Acton, an officer with the marine
patrol.
</P>
<P>
	   One dolphin remained under observation in a holding tank, and others in the
herd seemed reluctant to leave while the disabled dolphin remained in the area,
Acton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The trapped dolphins were part of a group of up to 100 that began coming
ashore Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents went into the water to keep the dolphins from coming into the
shallows of the bay, where some scratched themselves on the jagged, rocky
bottom.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it weren't for their efforts, the majority of the animals would have
died,'' Acton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials with the National Marine Fisheries Service were leading rescue
efforts and an investigation to find out why the dolphins were coming ashore. At
least one of the dead dolphins appeared to have a tumor, but it was not known if
that was related.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 100 dolphins died in late 1999 after being stranded. Examinations
of stranded dolphins that died in north Florida showed the animals had lesions
in their lungs and respiratory tracts. Red tide toxins have been suspected in
those cases.

<HEADLINE> Income Gap Widens for U.S. Families  </HEADLINE>
   By SHANNON McCAFFREY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The boom on Wall Street is widening the income gap
between the poorest and richest U.S. families, according to a report by two
Washington think tanks.
</P>
<P>
	   The earnings for the poorest fifth of American families rose less than 1
percent between 1988 and 1998 but jumped 15 percent for the richest fifth, the
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Economic Policy Institute said in
their report issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Income for the poorest families -- defined as two or more relatives living
together -- rose $110 to $12,990 during the 10-year period. For the richest
families it increased by $17,870, to $137,480, more than 10 times that of the
poorest sector, the report found.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The benefits of this (economic) growth have not been evenly distributed,''
said Elizabeth McNichol, one of the study's authors. ``The incomes of the poor
and middle class have fallen or stagnated.''
</P>
<P>
	   McNichol attributed the widening gap to Wall Street's long-running bull
market, which favors wealthy investors; lower-paying service jobs replacing
manufacturing jobs; and the largely stagnant minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
	   The gap between rich and poor was widest in New York, with the poorest fifth
earning $10,770, down $1,970, while the wealthiest group earned $152,350, up
$19,680. Income was most evenly distributed in Utah, where the poorest families
had incomes of $18,170 and the richest $125,930.
</P>
<P>
	   The income gap narrowed in just three states -- Alaska, Louisiana and
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen Moore, director of social policy for the Cato Institute, said the
study contorted data to put a negative face on a ``spectacular economy.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The rich are getting richer but the poor are getting richer too in this
expansion,'' said Moore, who nonetheless suggested cutting the tax on capital
gains income to further spur investment and job creation.
</P>
<P>
	   The income gap has made its way into presidential politics. Last weekend,
Arizona Sen. John McCain lashed out at the tax plan of his Republican rival,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, saying it would do nothing to alleviate the widening
gap between the ``haves and the have-nots.'' The Bush campaign countered that
McCain was engaging in ``class warfare.''
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley also have talked about the need to ensure
that the nation's poorest residents aren't left behind by the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
	   McNichol said increasing the minimum wage would help bridge the gap. Ten
states and the District of Columbia currently have minimum wages above the $5.15
national rate. The Senate last year passed a $1 minimum wage increase over three
years but the House failed to act on the measure.
</P>
<P>
	   McNichol also suggested strengthening states' and social safety net programs
for low-income workers, such as providing transportation and child care.
</P>
<P>
	   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Economic Policy Institute
are nonprofit, nonpartisan organizations pushing for changes in tax laws and
other federal policies to benefit low-and moderate-income families.
</P>
<P>
	   The study used before-tax data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The figures were
adjusted for inflation.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New Hampshire Democrats think Vice President Al Gore has
the best shot at winning the presidency in November and the state's Republicans
give the nod to Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a new poll says.
</P>
<P>
	   But challengers Bill Bradley and Sen. John McCain get a lot of respect from
New Hampshire voters, and the Democratic and Republican races for the state's
first-in-the-nation primaries Feb. 1 remain too close to call, according to an
ABC-Washington Post poll published in Tuesday editions of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those planning to vote in the GOP primary, the Arizona senator had 40
percent to 36 percent for Bush. On the Democratic side, Bradley, a former
senator, claimed the support of 48 percent while Gore was the choice of 47
percent. The differences in both races were within the poll's error margin.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll, of 2,223 New Hampshire adults -- including 733 likely Republican
primary voters and 534 likely Democratic primary voters -- was conducted
Thursday through Sunday. The error margin for the Republican and Democratic
samples was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain and Bradley do well when voters give their overall impressions of the
candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain fares very well with those who say they are likely to vote in the GOP
primary. He was viewed more favorably than Bush on nine of 11 traits measured in
the poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly three in four say the former Vietnam prisoner of war is ``an
inspiring candidate,'' while barely half say Bush inspires them. Similarly, more
Republicans see McCain as a strong leader, able to ``bring needed change to
Washington,'' and the most likely to tell the truth to the American people
``even if it's not politically popular.''
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, Democrats in New Hampshire rate Bradley as superior to Gore on a
majority of the traits measured, including bringing change to Washington, saying
what he thinks even if it's unpopular and being a more inspiring candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bush and Gore, front-runners in national polls, are both perceived by
those in their own parties as having the best chance of success in November, a
factor possibly balancing the good traits voters attribute to McCain and
Bradley.

Gore, Bradley Battle in 6th Debate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley challenged Vice President Al Gore
Monday night to demand the administration issue an immediate order banning
racial profiling, but Gore shot back in campaign debate, "I don't think
President Bill Clinton needs a lecture from Bill Bradley" on standing up for
blacks and Hispanics. Perched on stools on a debate stage in Iowa's capital
city, both men said firmly they oppose racial profiling, the practice by which
some police offers target racial minorities for traffic stops. A number of
racially sensitive issues came up in the hour-long televised debate on the
federal holiday honoring the late Martin Luther King, Jr.

<HEADLINE> Castro Had Fought Custody Battle  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- If Fidel Castro seems to be taking the case of 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez personally, it may be because he was party himself to a custody
battle involving his first-born son more than four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Elian, Fidelito Castro Diaz had parents with very different visions of
their child's future. Then, as now, the situations underscore the politics and
passions that for more than two generations have torn apart Cuban families
living on both sides of the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
	   While Castro recently blamed ``the extremist and terrorist mafia of South
Florida'' for keeping Elian in Miami and blocking his return ``to his legitimate
family and homeland,'' the battle over Elian is not between the Cuban and U.S.
governments. It is a fight within the Cuban family -- one that has even touched
Castro's.
</P>
<P>
	   According to biographers, Castro's ex-wife, Mirta Diaz-Balart, filed for
divorce in the mid-1950s, when he was imprisoned in Cuba for an attack on a
Santiago military barracks that launched the Cuban revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the divorce was final, Mirta Diaz left for the United States with
Fidelito, who was then 5.
</P>
<P>
	   During the divorce battle, the mother was granted custody, but Castro
insisted that the child be returned to Cuba, Tad Szulc writes in ``Fidel: A
Critical Portrait,'' a biography published in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   Castro's wife's brother, Rafael Diaz-Balart, was an official in the
government of President Fulgencio Batista, which Castro was trying to overthrow.
Castro worried about the influence the Diaz-Balart family would have on his son,
one of eight children Castro is known to have fathered.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I refuse even to think that my son may sleep a single night under the same
roof sheltering my most repulsive enemies and receive on his innocent cheeks the
kisses of those miserable Judases ... To take this child away from me, they'll
have to kill me ... I lose my head when I think about these things,'' Castro
wrote in a letter to his elder half-sister, Lidia.
</P>
<P>
	   After leaving prison, Castro continued to fight for custody, saying that if
he lost in court ``it would reaffirm my principles and my determination to fight
until death to live in a more decent republic.''
</P>
<P>
	   After being released from prison, Castro went to Mexico to prepare for a
guerrilla war against the Batista government.
</P>
<P>
	   While there, Castro persuaded Mirta Diaz-Balart to send him the boy for a
two-week visit. He never sent him back, Robert E. Quirk writes in the 1993
biography ``Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Castro turned the boy over to a couple in Mexico he trusted, with
instructions to sign him up for piano lessons.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, when Castro's sisters visited and took Fidelito for a stroll in
Mexico City's Chapultepec Park, three armed men jumped from a car and grabbed
the boy, Quirk wrote. Then Mirta Diaz-Balart flew to Mexico to pick the child
up.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite protests from Castro's sisters, the Mexican government said the
mother had custody rights to the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   By then, Castro was in eastern Cuba, fighting against Batista's troops.
After his successful 1959 revolution, the boy returned to live in Cuba with his
father, studied nuclear science in the former Soviet Union, and lives in Havana
today with his own family. He is 50.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the Diaz-Balart family eventually emigrated to Miami, with the
exception of Mirta Diaz-Balart, who was last known to be living in Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   Her nephew, U.S. Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., has been instrumental in
the battle to keep Elian in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's ... ironic that Castro's talking about having the interests of a
small child at heart when he kidnapped even his own son from his mother who had
custody in 1956,'' Diaz-Balart told CNN on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clutching an inner tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25.
His mother died in the fateful ocean crossing to the United States, and his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, is waging a fierce battle to repatriate the boy to
Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Airline Being Pummeled  </HEADLINE>
    By KARREN MILLS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- For Northwest Airlines, life always seems to be a series
of peaks and valleys with choppy air in between. Recently, the nation's
fourth-largest airline seems to be hitting some turbulence.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline is being pummeled from several directions, giving stockholders a
rocky ride as it spars with flight attendants over an alleged sickout, faces
criticism for leaving passengers aboard a plane delayed by weather and deals
with a programmer who left credit card numbers unprotected on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   Add to that a 22-year veteran pilot who left a plane full of passengers
before takeoff and caught a cab to an off-site restaurant because the special
meal he wanted wasn't put aboard the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilot was fired. Northwest isn't saying anything about the errant
programmer, but coughed up 5,000 frequent flier miles for each customer whose
credit card numbers were not secured.
</P>
<P>
	   The passengers stranded on the tarmac for 3 1/2 hours at Minneapolis-St.
Paul International Airport before their flight was canceled got an apology
letter and a free ticket after the fact.
</P>
<P>
	   But the public is left with the impression of an airline in turmoil, a
company dealing with loose-cannon employees in an industry hit by soaring fuel
prices and notoriously unstable fares.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest stock, which traded as high as $35.25 last July, now trades around
$22.
</P>
<P>
	   "This airline has got problems and you can quote me on that," said Charles
Hockert, a Twin Cities accountant whose flight to Las Vegas was delayed for an
hour in early December because flight attendants didn't show up on time. "They
called it a miscommunication over scheduling."
</P>
<P>
	   However, Hockert said he sympathizes with Northwest's flight attendants, who
have been seeking a new contract since September 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge also thought that was way too long without a settlement.
Although U.S. District Judge Donovan Frank ordered Teamsters Local 2000 to
prevent its flight attendants from staging a sickout over stalled contract
negotiations, he also ordered Northwest and the union to resume talks that had
been stalled since Dec. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge pulled back from the second order within a day after the National
Mediation Board wrote him a letter maintaining he had no jurisdiction. The board
has called the union to a status conference in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 25 and
Local 2000 President Billie Davenport said no developments in the contract
dispute are expected until after the conference.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're just busy getting our proposals together," Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
	   Davenport said Monday the union has prepared a new set of bargaining
proposals, which it will present to the board at that Jan. 25 meeting in
anticipation of new contract talks. Her news release gave no details of the
proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   "The judge's order gives us an excellent opportunity to restart contract
talks," Davenport said. "We are prepared and we hope that the company will take
the judge's order seriously and come back to the table prepared to bargain."
</P>
<P>
	   Members of Local 2000, which represents 10,800 Northwest flight attendants,
rejected a tentative agreement in August.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest maintains that the series of incidents that has kept the airline
in the news since November does not indicate the carrier is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every company has a series of streaks of stuff that they wish wasn't in the
news," spokesman Jon Austin said. The security breach on the Web site resulted
in calls from "a few people who've been ticked off and I think that's
reasonable. But most were pleased that we notified them and even more pleased
about the 5,000 World Perks miles that we included."
</P>
<P>
	   Austin said a company is in trouble when it stops responding and trying to
remedy complaints.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the thing not to do for a company is to get gun-shy about not doing
the right thing," he said. "We will make other mistakes. When we do that we owe
it to people to own up to them."

<HEADLINE> Ben-&AMP;-Jerry's Sale Opposed  </HEADLINE>
    By ROSS SNEYD AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Ben &AMP; Jerry's has a powerful following not only for
its gourmet ice cream, but also for its brand of corporate social activism.
</P>
<P>
	   So an unsolicited bid last month to take over the Vermont company has
generated several grassroots campaigns to block it, reflecting the near-cult
status that has grown up around the company.
</P>
<P>
	   "People who love our ice cream love the fact that there really is a Ben and
there really is a Jerry," said Michael Garrett, owner of four Ben &AMP; Jerry's
franchises in Connecticut and New York. "They don't want to see their heroes
selling out."
</P>
<P>
	   Garrett wouldn't lose his franchises if Ben &AMP; Jerry's were sold, but he said
he's worried about losing the identity of the business. He's got a message for
any suitors: "If by some miracle you are able to take us over, we're not
changing. You have to change," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade Inc., known for serving flavors like Rainforest
Crunch and embracing the liberal causes of the former hippies who founded the
business, revealed last month that it was being courted, although it did not say
who was doing the bidding.
</P>
<P>
	   The common thread of those fighting to preserve Ben &AMP; Jerry's is that its
board consider more than just the financial impact on its shareholders when it
evaluates a takeover bid. They want the company also to consider how a sale
would affect its corporate culture, its customers and the communities where it
operates.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ben &AMP; Jerry's was a groundbreaker in raising consciousness that capital
can, in fact, be caring," said Judy Wicks, owner of the White Dog Cafe in
Philadelphia and a proponent of socially responsible business practices.
</P>
<P>
	   She's also helping a group calling itself the Coalition to Save Ben &AMP;
Jerry's to organize a series of rallies across the country next week. The
rallies are designed to generate support for Ben &AMP; Jerry's remaining
independent.
</P>
<P>
	   Rallies are planned outside Ben &AMP; Jerry's scoop shops in New York,
Washington, San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, Montreal and Baltimore. Arrangements
are being made for rallies in Chicago and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides that, a majority of the 206 Ben &AMP; Jerry's franchise stores are
encouraging customers to send postcards to the company's board members urging
them to reject any takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
	   There are two Web sites dedicated to Ben &AMP; Jerry's independence.
</P>
<P>
	   An independence rally was held outside the company's flagship store in
Burlington last month. Gov. Howard Dean has practically declared the company a
symbol of the state it calls home.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ben &AMP; Jerry's is a signature company for Vermont," he said. "It is like
maple syrup. Ben &AMP; Jerry's has probably done more to market Vermont than any
company in the last 20 years."
</P>
<P>
	   But it's much more than marketing that creates such a loyal following for
the manufacturer of super premium ice creams, frozen yogurts, sorbets and other
frozen foods. It's the notion of corporate social responsibility that Ben Cohen
and Jerry Greenfield made a cornerstone of their business.
</P>
<P>
	   Not only does Ben &AMP; Jerry's donate 7.5 percent of its pretax profits to
charity, it maintains a so-called double bottom line dedicated to earning a
profit and promoting social good. That includes buying milk from small family
farms and its nuts from sustainable farms in the South American rainforests.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was Ben &AMP; Jerry's, Ben specifically, that came up with the concept of
the double bottom line," Wicks said.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were the teachers and they have been teachers and continue to be

that business can serve the common good and not just the financial interests of
businesses and stockholders," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   That -- in addition to funky ice cream flavors such as Cherry Garcia and
Wavy Gravy -- are what has drawn thousands to buy stock in Ben &AMP; Jerry's and to
sell its products.
</P>
<P>
	   "I got into this business 12 years ago and, truly, that's why I got into
it," Garrett said. "I could have gotten a Haagen-Dazs franchise."
</P>
<P>
	   Ben &AMP; Jerry's may be able to take advantage of a change in Vermont corporate
law that allows companies to consider the interests of its employees, suppliers,
creditors, customers and the economy of the state in deciding a takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
	   It's unclear whether that's being weighed by directors. The company has
declined to comment. Greenfield, reached at home Monday, said Securities and
Exchange Commission regulations prevented him from discussing board
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't say anything about this," Greenfield said. "No decisions have been
made; no implications should be drawn."

<HEADLINE> Job Cuts From Drug Merger Expected  </HEADLINE>
    By GARY D. ROBERTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. (AP) -- It is far too early to tell about any
job cuts that could result from the merger of drug makers Glaxo Wellcome PLC and
SmithKline Beecham PLC, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, both companies affirmed their commitment to both their respective
campuses in Research Triangle Park, N.C., and Philadelphia areas, while the
merged company's U.S. headquarters will move to the New York metro area.
</P>
<P>
	   The British parents of the two companies announced Monday a long-awaited $76
billion stock deal that would create Glaxo SmithKline, the world's largest
pharmaceutical company, with products from Aquafresh toothpaste and Contac cold
medicine to Zyban and NicoDerm smoking cessation products.
</P>
<P>
	   Some cutbacks are expected from duplicate positions within the companies,
but Glaxo spokesman Rick Sluder refused to comment on a British newspaper report
that the new company expects to cut 10 percent of its combined 106,000-member
work force.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's premature to speculate on what size any of the operations will be,"
Sluder said Monday. "It may take weeks or months before a total is determined."
</P>
<P>
	   But Sluder reaffirmed the new company' commitment to North Carolina and
Pennsylvania, saying the operations are "important for a company in which it has
almost half of its revenue originating in the U.S. market."
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said they expected any cutbacks to fall heaviest in the United
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
	   Neil Sweik, a pharmaceutical analyst with Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co. in New York,
expects few job cuts in the companies' research and development and
pharmaceuticals sectors, which bodes well for Philadelphia and Research Triangle
Park.
</P>
<P>
	   "The U.S. accounts for 60 percent of company profits. It's not an uncommon
figure in this market, which is by far their largest sales market," said Sweik.
</P>
<P>
	   SmithKline Beecham urged its 9,000 Pennsylvania employees Monday to be
patient as they await word on the impact of the company's merger with Glaxo
Wellcome on individual jobs and departments.
</P>
<P>
	   "These questions cannot be answered in the first few weeks or months," said
a notice of the merger that greeted employees arriving in the lobby of
SmithKline's U.S. headquarters in downtown Philadelphia. "The months ahead will
be challenging and stressful."
</P>
<P>
	   Several employees in the lobby said they had been asked not to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   SmithKline employs 2,000 workers at Philadelphia headquarters as well as
2,800 at two research operations in the suburbs, 3,600 jobs in its consumer
health care business in Pittsburgh and several hundred scattered sales and
marketing jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   A Glaxo employee who refused to give her name expressed optimism about the
mega-merger.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's great. If it's good for the business, It's good for me," a worker said
while waiting for a traffic light to change at Glaxo's campus entrance here.
</P>
<P>
	   About 4,800 of Glaxo Wellcome's 5,900 employees in North Carolina work at
Research Triangle Park; the rest are employed at Glaxo's manufacturing plant in
Zebulon, where products such as ulcer medication Zantac are produced.

<HEADLINE> Houseware Makers Introduce Products  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- From aroma lamps to waterfalls, some of the catchiest
products on display at the world's largest trade fair for housewares aren't
particularly useful. But they sure are fun.
</P>
<P>
	   In search of the next hot item -- or the next cool one -- in the $63 billion
U.S. housewares industry, an estimated 60,000 buyers and sellers are at the
International Housewares Show this week.
</P>
<P>
	   The emphasis is not on must-have items but on innovations and high-end
quality, reflecting the boom times.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's reflective of the economy that we're in, and of demographics -- baby
boomers getting older and having more disposable income," said Philip Brandl,
president of the National Housewares Manufacturers Association, which sponsors
the show.
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Weiskopf of Midwest Tropical Inc. agrees that consumers these days have
"a little more money to spend on accessories." Often, he said, they look to
spend it on something "new and eye-catching."
</P>
<P>
	   That explains why these are such good times for coffee tables with plastic
fish floating in them.
</P>
<P>
	   Weiskopf's company, based in Lincolnwood, Ill., just north of Chicago, makes
those, along with CD bubble racks, indoor waterfalls and the hot-selling "aqua
palm" -- an 8 1/2-foot-tall artificial tree with fluorescent water bubbles
cascading through a transparent trunk.
</P>
<P>
	   The waterfalls -- trickling down a facade like the black monolith from the
movie "2001" -- have been sold to offices for a few years. But thanks to a
booming economy, they suddenly are flowing into living rooms in significant
numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   A new, smaller (5-foot) version of the so-called aqua fall on display at the
industry-only trade show goes for a "mere" $399, the first opportunity for Joe
Consumer to buy a waterfall for less than $1,000. It features recirculating
water systems and halogen lighting with interchangeable red, blue, yellow and
green lenses.
</P>
<P>
	   The fish tables retail for $999 to $1,199.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've put more of this stuff in people's living rooms in the last year or
so than ever before," Weiskopf says, almost gleefully.
</P>
<P>
	   Another innovation drawing attention at the show is a lamp alarm clock that
can be programmed to gradually brighten your room just as the rising sun does.
</P>
<P>
	   The user can set the Rise &AMP; Shine light and sound alarm clock for a 15- or
30-minute wake-up cycle, with the choice of eight programmable sounds, including
birds singing, a brook babbling or horses' hooves clip-clopping in a country
town.
</P>
<P>
	   If you get desperate, you can even turn off all the gizmos and use it as a
regular lamp and buzzer alarm clock. Retail price: about $199.
</P>
<P>
	   Representatives of Stamford, Conn.-based Verilux, who were touting the
product Monday, called the innovation "a quality-of-life issue."
</P>
<P>
	   Pampering is the issue with HoMedics, a Commerce Township, Mich.-based
company that was displaying indoor mini-fountains for $20 to $100, aroma lamps
for $19.99 and bubble jet bath massagers -- a sort of everyman's Jacuzzi -- soon
to go on the market for $100 to $179.
</P>
<P>
	   The recently introduced "relaxing fountains" have proved so successful that
HoMedics has 13 new versions of the items, in which water gurgles over a small
display of stones worthy of a Zen monastery.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're all about relaxation -- we're about 'Get off the Internet,"' said
marketing director Paulette Abraham. "De-stressing is wellness."

<HEADLINE> 70 Homes Torched in Fla. Arson Spree  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Arsonists in two Tampa neighborhoods have burned 70
vacant houses that were to be repaired, moved or bulldozed as part of urban
renewal and highway construction projects.
</P>
<P>
	   No one has been injured in the two-year spree, but residents in Tampa
Heights and Ybor City neighborhoods worry that could change.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a lot of fear and a lot of sorrow,'' said Sandy Ramos, a
Neighborhood Watch leader. ``We all live in wood houses. We don't want to see a
loss of life. If there's a firebug living amongst us, we have to know.''
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the fires in the adjoining neighborhoods remain unsolved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We haven't come up with any wonderful information that would lead us
somewhere,'' said Assistant Fire Marshal Todd Spear.
</P>
<P>
	   Ybor City, home to the early Cuban immigrants who worked in the city's cigar
factories, and Tampa Heights, which housed the city's elite at the turn of the
20th century, are due for a renaissance.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonprofit agencies are buying run-down homes in Tampa Heights. Thirty-two
cottages in Ybor City's federal historic landmark district will be moved out of
the way of highway construction, and about half will be restored.
</P>
<P>
	   Some in the neighborhoods suggest the city isn't serious about stopping the
fires, seeing them as a cheap alternative to bulldozing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We take pains to put these fires out,'' Mayor Dick Greco said. ``Our
firefighters' lives could be at risk over something that isn't worth a dime.''

<HEADLINE> TV Head Praises U.S. Drug Policy  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The head of the WB television network, the most
popular one among teen-age girls, is applauding government efforts to insert
anti-drug messages in the plots of comedies and dramas.
</P>
<P>
	   The network twice sought the advice of President Clinton's anti-drug
counselors on scripts for its prime-time shows. But Jamie Kellner, the WB's
chief executive, said the network received no financial benefit for pushing a
message that discourages drug use.
</P>
<P>
	   "I look at this as the government being very clever in trying to find a way
to get a message out that we totally support," Kellner said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The WB consistently has one of network TV's youngest audiences, appealing
particularly to teen-age girls with shows like "Dawson's Creek." The two
programs where it sought government advice on scripts were "The Wayans Brothers"
and "Smart Guy."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's Office of National Drug Control Policy never asked to see WB
scripts in advance; in the two applicable cases, the network volunteered them,
Kellner said. ABC executives said over the weekend that they became
uncomfortable with Clinton's advisers asking to see scripts of shows before they
aired.
</P>
<P>
	   The WB routinely consults with experts outside government for advice when
producing shows, on such issues as teen pregnancy, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We enjoy doing something that is pro-socially responsible, especially since
we reach a younger audience," Kellner said. "I think people should applaud the
government for being clever. Normally they pay $500 for a toilet seat."
</P>
<P>
	   Kellner said the WB wouldn't have any problems talking to the White House
about scripts in the future, though the network may seek help outside the
government to avoid public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to advice, Clinton's drug advisers offered broadcasters
financial benefits for including anti-drug messages within the plots of
entertainment programs. Under the arrangement, the government would let networks
out of a commitment to air some anti-drug public service announcements, enabling
them to sell the commercial time to other clients.
</P>
<P>
	   While the WB ran fewer public service ads after it produced anti-drug
programming, it did not use the extra time to sell more commercials, Kellner
said. Instead, the network ran promotional announcements or other PSAs.

<HEADLINE> The New-World Buzzword Is 'Content'  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN CUNNIFF AP Business Analyst
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The newest pursuit in mergers is content. As a provider of
Internet access you need content to survive. As a seller of content, you need
Internet access to reach customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Content is, in old world terms, the oil that flows through the pipeline. In
the new world, it's information, entertainment and, as they say, much, much more
that races through cable, wires and air.
</P>
<P>
	   Existing apart, a content producer is a merchant without an outlet, and an
Internet provider is a storefront without much merchandise. Join them and you
create a synergistic powerhouse. You know, two and two equals five.
</P>
<P>
	   It's the new-world version of an old, old thesis that married life is more
productive than single. And while that is likely to be true in personal affairs,
is may or may not be in business.
</P>
<P>
	   Entered with the greatest expectations in the past, business mergers often
were followed by divestitures, or a recognition that sometimes a company is
better by itself than in combination.
</P>
<P>
	   It was so as recently as the 1960s and 1970s, when conglomerates were
assembled and then torn apart, the hope then being that the cyclical strength of
one company would offset that of another.
</P>
<P>
	   While that didn't always turn out to be so, there were other problems too,
among them cultural -- companies that had strong pre-merger identities couldn't
avoid conflicts with one another. And there were problems with synergy; so often
it just didn't exist.
</P>
<P>
	   The expectation today is that you the consumer want content, at least as
much as that already available on the newsstands, in record stores, on magazine
racks and television and radio and ...
</P>
<P>
	   All this is for you, and of course it is all aimed at making your life
easier and more enjoyable. Or at least that's the claim.
</P>
<P>
	   But the big question already being asked is who can absorb so much content.
Even today some people are taking defensive positions against what they see as
an existing content attack on their homes. V-chips in TV sets, for example. And
censorship of publications.
</P>
<P>
	   With broadband communication lines able to carry many times more information
than before, content is destined to become the universe's next Big Bang,
exploding into everyone's consciousness.
</P>
<P>
	   Some will be useful, extremely so, and likely to make life easier, more
productive and less time-consuming, and to be rewarding in myriad other ways.
Some of it, groceries, stocks and banking on line, for example, are already
here, but are still only a sampling.
</P>
<P>
	   Much may not be so welcome, and therein, say critics, lies one of the
potential weaknesses of the latest merger concept.
</P>
<P>
	   It is the acceptance of the notion that people have an unlimited desire for
content and an equally vast ability to absorb it, like it or not. Sort of like
the goose being prepared for foie gras.
</P>
<P>
	   It may be a different story with business, which may be far more willing to
change its ways. It has the capacity to absorb new ways of doing business. It
has the profit motive to attract it to change, and the survival instinct pushing
it.
</P>
<P>
	   Big Business, however, has the ability to create its own systems for dealing
with the new world as Ford and General Motors have already shown by planning to
offer their online supply system for other companies to use.
</P>
<P>
	   And consumers too have their defense. The Internet provides them with
enormously more options, even if it means they must pan through the flow of
material to find a shiny gold nugget here and there.

<HEADLINE> Dairy Farmers Face Bankruptcy  </HEADLINE>
    By SETH HETTENA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- East Coast dairy farmers say a precipitous drop in
milk prices has left many of them facing financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising production in the Western United States lowered the federal minimum
price of milk to $9.63 per 100 pounds last month, a drop of more than $6 since
September. The last time prices were this low was in 1978.
</P>
<P>
	   George Donnon, who tends 80 cows near Rising Sun, said he is losing $5,000
per month in income.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am not sure how long I can survive at this price," Donnon said.
</P>
<P>
	   Beleaguered dairy farmers from Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York and Alabama
set aside their chores Monday morning to rally in the cold outside the Maryland
State House for fairness in milk pricing.
</P>
<P>
	   They were joined by representatives of the Maryland Chapter of the Sierra
Club, who say preserving the 830 dairy farms in Maryland is a key to curbing
urban sprawl and preserving open spaces.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of Maryland dairy farms is down from 1,140 in 1991, according to
the Maryland Farm Bureau.
</P>
<P>
	   "Maryland's dairy farmers are in danger of disappearing," said Chris
Bedford, chairman of the Sierra Club's Water, Food and Farm Campaign. "That
affects everybody."
</P>
<P>
	   The low milk prices could have been averted had Congress allowed Maryland to
join the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, said Myron Wilhide, president of
the Maryland Dairy Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want a compact," he said. "It takes the highs and the lows out."
</P>
<P>
	   The compact allows a federally authorized organization of six New England
states to set milk prices above the federal minimum. Last year, Congress
extended the compact for two years but locked out prospective new members,
including Maryland, in a compromise between Northeastern and Midwestern
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryland farmers need milk prices of at least $14.40 per 100 pounds of milk
(about 12 gallons) in order to survive, Wilhide said. The Sierra Club, citing
federal studies, said farmers need about $18.80.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama dairy farmer Joe Heurion welcomed the support of the environmental
group.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm sick and tired of working myself and my family to death to make
corporate America billions of dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some farmers have begun dumping milk to protest the low prices, said New
York State dairyman Fred LeClair.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifth-generation Amish dairyman Daniel Dienner says all 30 of the families
in his Lancaster County, Pa., church district used to support themselves with
dairy farms. Now, the number is down to seven and Dienner said he feels his way
of life is threatened.
</P>

<P>
	   WAUSAU, Wis. (AP) -- Faced with low prices for ginseng, some Marathon County
growers are turning to an alternative crop, called goldenseal, which is growing
in popularity as an herbal remedy for sore throats and colds.
</P>
<P>
	   "We feel there's a benefit in herbs," said Bob Veers, a grower in Stratford.
"We use them ourselves."
</P>
<P>
	   Jerry Petrowski, a ginseng grower from Marathon and also a state
representative, said ginseng prices are so low -- between $8 to $12 a pound --
that growers looking for alternatives are attracted to goldenseal because it
grows easier than ginseng and sells for $30 to $40 a pound.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Bandli, an agriculture marketing consultant with the state Department
of Agriculture, said raising goldenseal is another way for farmers to diversify
and "insulate themselves from fluctuations in the marketplace."

<HEADLINE> End To Annual Budget Battle Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In what has become an annual rite of pain, Congress last
fall again failed to complete its budget work on time and had to resort to
hectic negotiations that lumped together hundreds of programs in one giant bill
that almost nobody liked or understood.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, an increasing number of lawmakers say the best way to restore some
order to this chaos is to switch to a two-year budget cycle.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., has more than 240 co-sponsors, well over half
the House, supporting a resolution stating that a biennial budget process should
be enacted this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Significantly, one of Dreier's chief partners in the resolution is
Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla. Appropriators, who are
responsible for steering the 13 federal spending bills through Congress every
year, have been the most resistant to a two-year budget, fearing it would weaken
their control over the process.
</P>
<P>
	   The idea has other powerful proponents. Vice President Al Gore and leading
Republican presidential candidates Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John
McCain of Arizona have expressed support, and Senate Budget Committee Chairman
Pete Domenici, R-N.M., is a longtime advocate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm like a lot of Americans who are concerned about the constant budget
hassles that seem to dominate the Thanksgiving season,'' Bush said in November.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Annual budgeting encourages budgeting by brinkmanship,'' McCain has said.
</P>
<P>
	   Only twice in the past quarter-century has Congress completed action on the
13 spending bills by the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year. Republicans gained
control of Congress in 1994, and they in particular have been receptive to
changes in the system since they took much of the blame for the lengthy
government shutdown in the winter of 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Republicans also feel President Clinton forced them into accepting
unwanted spending in end-of-year negotiations the past two years. In 1998 that
produced a 4,000-page, 40-pound document. Last year, some 50 days after the
fiscal year began, Congress hurriedly passed a $390 billion bill financing seven
cabinet departments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If anybody here can say with an honest expression on their face that they
know what everything is in that bill, well, God save you,'' Rep. Gil Gutknecht,
R-Minn., told his colleagues in the final debate on the package.
</P>
<P>
	   The main premise of the several biennial budget bills that have been
introduced is that the president would propose, and Congress approve, a two-year
budget in the first year of a congressional session. Congress could then devote
the second year to its other constitutional responsibility, oversight of federal
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   It would ``remove the bulk of the appropriations and other budgeting
processes from election-year politics,'' said Rep. Charles Bass, R-N.H., sponsor
of one of the bills.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Bixby of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan group that crusades for
balanced budgets, noted that many states and federal agencies such as the
Pentagon already do their budget planning on a two-year or multiyear basis, and,
after the budget fiascos of the past several years, ``the case for a two-year
budget has never been stronger.''
</P>
<P>
	   One long-standing argument against the biennial budget is that it would make
it harder to deal with sudden economic changes, international crises such as
Kosovo or natural disasters. But Bixby said Congress can always handle
unexpected events with emergency spending bills.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, getting a biennial budget bill passed this year will be an uphill
fight in the House, which traditionally has been leery of getting only one shot
at federal spending during a two-year session. There has always been more
sympathy for the idea in the Senate, where senators have six years to affect
policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is one of the greatest overhauls to the operation of the federal
government in a long time,'' Dreier said in acknowledging the difficulties
ahead. But the budget battles of the past couple of years have ``led us to think
there's got to be a better way.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Rejects U.N.'s Iraq Inspector  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Russia has formally objected to Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's decision to appoint Rolf Ekeus of Sweden chief weapons inspector
for Iraq, throwing the nomination into doubt and marking an ominous start to a
new U.N. policy for Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov sent a letter Monday evening to the
Security Council president informing him that Moscow ``cannot agree with the
proposal,'' a U.S. official said, reading from the letter.
</P>
<P>
	   The president, U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, scheduled council
consultations for this afternoon to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan told the council earlier Monday that, after a monthlong effort to find
a new chief inspector, he had decided Ambassador Rolf Ekeus of Sweden should be
appointed to head the new agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency, called the U.N. Monitoring and Verification and Inspection
Commission, was formed in December to replace the U.N. Special Commission, or
UNSCOM, which pulled out of Baghdad in December 1998, ahead of U.S. and British
airstrikes. Iraq has said UNSCOM inspectors cannot return.
</P>
<P>
	   Ekeus was the original executive chairman of UNSCOM, which was created in
1991 in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War to rid Iraq of its weapons of mass
destruction. He stepped down in 1997 to become Sweden's ambassador to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   While his successor, Richard Butler of Australia, incurred the wrath of the
Iraqis during his tumultuous two-year term, Ekeus also was harshly criticized by
Baghdad's leadership, particularly toward the end of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
	   Before its outright rejection, Russia along with China told Annan on Friday
that they opposed nominating Ekeus because he wouldn't be acceptable to Iraq.
France also indicated it preferred other candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia, France and China -- along with Malaysia -- abstained from the
December vote that created the new commission, UNMOVIC. Their opposition to
Annan's candidate signaled that efforts to restart weapons inspections in Iraq
would be long and difficult.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq questioned Ekeus' nomination altogether on Monday, saying it amounted
to putting ``old wine in new bottles.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``How can they appoint a new commission and then name its former head to
lead it?'' Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz asked reporters after a
meeting in Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   Aziz accused Ekeus of deliberately prolonging the U.N. trade sanctions
imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Under U.N. resolutions, sanctions can only be lifted once inspectors report
Iraq is free of its biological, chemical and nuclear weapons and missiles used
to deliver them.
</P>
<P>
	   Aziz also said the Swedish diplomat allowed inspectors to spy on Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
	   Aziz, however, did not say whether Iraq would cooperate with Ekeus if his
nomination was approved.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't immediately clear whether Russia's rejection doomed Ekeus'
chances. U.N. officials said it would be up to the council and its president to
decide today how to proceed -- whether to ask Russia to reconsider or to request
Annan try again.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan had considered a list of about 25 candidates over the course of a
month, but failed to secure unanimous council consensus on any one. ``So he put
forward the name of the person he thought best for the job,'' spokesman Fred
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ekeus' six-year tenure as chief U.N. inspector was marked by several
important developments, including the uncovering of Iraq's biological weapons
program.
</P>
<P>
	   But Ekeus also raised eyebrows at the United Nations when he cut a deal with
the Iraqis to gain access to so-called ``sensitive sites'' in 1996, setting up
special procedures for access that weren't specified in U.N. resolutions. Some
at the United Nations believe that deal was the first step in UNSCOM's downfall,
setting the stage for future Iraqi attempts to prevent or complicate inspectors'
access to certain sites.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, Ekeus was known to be Annan's top choice from the beginning.
In fact, Annan told a press conference in December that his ideal candidate was
``somebody like Rolf Ekeus.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ekeus was scheduled to retire as Sweden's U.S. ambassador in June, and was
set to take up a five-year position as chairman of the governing board of the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Talks Grind to a Halt  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA ABU-NASR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was supposed to have been a nine-day recess during
which Israel and Syria would quietly review and suggest amendments to a
U.S.-drafted working document before they resumed U.S.-brokered peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   But publication of the document by an Israeli newspaper led to the kind of
public negotiating and posturing the Americans had tried hard to prevent. And
high-level negotiations between the two parties that had been set to reconvene
on Wednesday have been postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
	   The main obstacle remained the extent of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, a strategic border plateau that Israel captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria's Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa told Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in a telephone conversation over the weekend that his evaluation of the
second round of talks, requested by Albright, was that the Israelis were not
serious about peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Al-Sharaa told Albright the Syrians would not participate in a third round
until the Israelis were prepared to demarcate a new border at the pre-1967 war
lines, a Syrian source close to the Syrian government said.
</P>
<P>
	   The source said if that issue were resolved, there would be little left to
negotiate: ``When they are serious, in one round we will finish the entire
operation of peace.''
</P>
<P>
	   Damascus' insistence on demarcation of borders is not new. But leaking of
the document has made it almost impossible for the Syrians to return to
negotiating without first getting Israel to clarify its position regarding
withdrawal from the Golan. Otherwise it would look as if Syria were addressing
Israel's worries without tackling its main concern: land.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, the document indicated Syria already has been flexible on the issue
of normal peaceful relations, such as the establishment of open frontiers,
promotion of bilateral trade and tourism, and an exchange of ambassadors -- even
before wresting a commitment from the Jewish state on borders.
</P>
<P>
	   In the document, Israel said it wanted to hold off on a border discussion
until it knew more about security arrangements and the type of peace Syria would
offer.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior U.S. official said that if the United States had insisted on going
ahead with talks Wednesday, they would have been held. But with the two sides
sharply disagreeing on how to proceed, each wanting his priority demands dealt
with first, the outlook for progress was not bright.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Israel and Syria each agreed to send two experts to Washington to
nibble away at issues that are not central to land-for-peace negotiations. After
that, the administration will decide how to proceed, said the official, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright blamed neither side for the postponement but said in a statement
their approaches differed to the U.S.-prepared document, which the Americans had
hoped would form a basis for an accord.
</P>
<P>
	   As'ad AbuKhalil, an associate professor at California State University at
Stanislaus, said the Syrians were unhappy because they ``felt that the leaking
of the document took place at the expense of the negotiating posture of the
Syrian government.''
</P>
<P>
	   But AbuKhalil said if the talks freeze at this point, the Syrians can turn
the deadlock into a victory by saying they had adhered to their steadfast
position. That would be bolstered by the fact that the Syrians avoided any
appearance of being chummy with the Israelis: they don't shake hands, they don't
engage in pleasantries, and they don't rush to embrace like Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
	   William Quandt, a professor at the University of Virginia who participated
in the Egyptian-Israeli peace talks in 1978, said those negotiations were on the
verge of collapse half a dozen times before they succeeded.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the midst of one of these crises, you never know whether it's the kind
of last ... posturing before the final deal is struck or whether it's actually
going to create prolonged delay,'' said Quandt, a member of President Carter's
National Security Council staff.
</P>
<P>
	   But he added that he was optimistic that the Syrian-Israeli negotiations are
still on track.
</P>
<P>
	   Quandt said it would be up to President Clinton to help create conditions in
which both sides see it is in their interest to come back to the table.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Democrats Hold Edge Over GOP  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- One-fourth of George W. Bush's supporters trend
Democratic on the issues, according to an internal Republican poll that
indicates that victory in the presidential race wouldn't necessarily be enough
to keep the House in GOP hands.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans must ``open a new issue front,'' as well as ``redefine some key
existing issues'' more to their political advantage heading into the fall
elections, according to the survey findings, shared recently with several dozen
rank-and-file Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Twenty-five percent of Bush's vote prefers Democrats on the issues by a
significant margin,'' according to the material circulated at a communications
workshop convened by Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., the fourth-ranking member of the
GOP leadership. The poll was conducted for Securing America's Future for
Everyone (SAFE), an organization Watts set up to assist him in his leadership
post.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans hold a narrow 222-212 majority in the current House, with one
Democratic-leaning independent. A switch of five seats would deliver control to
the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey found Republicans must make a greater effort to develop their
``brand,'' much as any organization must do as it competes for market share.
Democrats were favored, 44 percent to 31 percent, when the survey asked
potential voters which party cares more about them, according to the poll shown
recently to about 50 GOP members of the House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They've got to connect ideology to solving problems. That's their
mission,'' said David Winston of the Fabrizio McLaughlin firm, which conducted
the poll. The 1,000-person survey was conducted in November, at a time when Bush
was outpolling Democratic contenders by wide margins. It has a margin of error
or plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   On three of the top five issues, as identified by potential voters,
Democrats hold an edge, the poll reported. They lead on education, the
top-ranked issue, by 16 percentage points; on health care by an even bigger
margin; and strongly on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans are favored by a wide margin on moral values. As for handling
the economy, neither side held a statistically significant advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   On six other issues tested, which the voters defined as somewhat less
important, Republicans hold a narrow advantage on taxes and a more substantial
edge on foreign policy and defense as well as on crime and drugs. Democrats are
favored on Medicare and the environment. Campaign finance was a statistical tie.
</P>
<P>
	   The margins for Democrats were ``much higher'' than for the GOP, the poll
found.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans were urged to adopt a strategy that includes stressing new
issues, such as government waste and a plan to eliminate the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Top leaders have mentioned both in recent days, and Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., is expected to lay out a plan in the next several days to retire the
national debt by 2015.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Republicans were urged to ``redefine key issues,'' and handed a
blueprint on one of them -- education.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats have led in polling on the subject by wide margins in recent
years, in part because several Republicans who came to power in 1995 advocated
eliminating the Education Department.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll taken for Watts' organization found that Democrats enjoy a 16-point
gap on the issue, but the material circulated to the lawmakers suggested a
reversal was possible.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey said Republicans who stress a message of better education for
children by giving local schools flexibility to ``hire new teachers, purchase
new books, provide teacher training, buy computers and repair classrooms''
outpoll Democrats who advocate funding for ''100,000 new teachers'' to reduce
class size.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announcing New Gun Program  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is asking Congress for $280 million in
additional funds to hire 500 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents and
inspectors and create a program to track guns through ballistics testing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're at a moment where crime rates across the country are going down, but
the message that we feel is important to send is that we've got to keep our
vigilance up,'' said Eric Liu, the White House deputy domestic policy adviser.
``We have to do all that we can to strengthen our enforcement efforts and crack
down on gun criminals.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was announcing the program to hire 500 more ATF personnel today in
Boston. The appearance at the Orchard Gardens Community Center in Boston's
Roxbury section also was expected to highlight Clinton's community policing
initiative.
</P>
<P>
	   The emphasis on law enforcement represented a subtle shift in the
administration's efforts to curb gun violence.
</P>
<P>
	   After a spate of high-profile shooting attacks by troubled killers at high
schools and community centers, Clinton pushed for tougher gun-control measures
in Congress. But legislation has stalled over such issues as how to extend Brady
law background checks to gun shows or whether to require safety locks on
handguns.
</P>
<P>
	   Outlining plans for his final year in office, Clinton last week alluded to
new projects aimed at curbing gun violence. The administration already announced
a request for $10 million to develop ``smart guns'' that fire only when held by
their owners. A similar request died in Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The new plans for the budget for fiscal year 2001, which begins Oct. 1,
represent an effort to invest more in enforcement of existing laws on the
illegal use and possession of firearms, a priority for Republicans and groups
such as the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These things are all overlapping armor,'' said Liu. ``I don't think it
makes sense to focus on one piece to the exclusion of others.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton intended to ask Congress to hire the new ATF agents and inspectors
and 1,000 more federal, state and local prosecutors to focus on gun-related
crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   He also will seek to expand an existing gun-tracing program from 38 to 51
cities and ask for $30 million to create a National Integrated Ballistics
Information Network to track ballistics data of guns used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   By maintaining records of unique markings each gun barrel leaves on bullets,
investigators could track firearms used in crimes to their purchasers, even if
that person had passed the weapon to another individual.
</P>
<P>
	   Boston's homicide rate dropped to a 38-year low in 1999, thanks in part to a
program that allied law enforcement, the clergy, community leaders and gang
members against crime.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston Pilot Project is credited with the homicide toll dropping from
132 slayings in 1990 to 31 in 1999. A strong economy and declining use of crack
cocaine also contributed to improved neighborhood security.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Thomas Menino, Rep. Michael Capuano, and Massachusetts Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, all Democrats, and several religious and community leaders were
expected to attend the address at the Orchard Gardens, in an area where crime
was down more than 65 percent last year, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   In his Roxbury appearance, Clinton also was expected to stress the success
of his 1994 crime-fighting package, which provided money for 100,000 community
police officers. The fiscal 2000 budget includes funds for 50,000 more.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, Clinton was addressing a Democratic National Committee
fund-raising reception at a private residence in a Boston suburb.

<HEADLINE> US Keeping Eye on Iran Nuke Program  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- National security officials are increasingly worried that
Iran, with help from Russia, may be closer than previously believed to producing
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the chief concerns, said administration officials, is the continued
flow of technology to Tehran, primarily from Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials reacted with alarm to reports over the weekend that Iran may
order an additional three nuclear reactors from Russia. Russian engineers are
already building one reactor at a site in southern Iran under an existing
contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Moscow and Tehran insist that the reactors are only intended for power
generation and there has been no diversion to weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
	   But U.S. intelligence analysts have become more skeptical as Iran acquires
more nuclear materials and technology.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've said all along that we are concerned about Iran's efforts to develop
ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction,'' White House national
security spokesman David Leavy said on Monday. ``We will continue to work hard
to block those efforts.''
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Times, in Monday's editions, reported that the Central
Intelligence Agency could no longer rule out that Iran may already be able to
make a nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
	   CIA Director George Tenet has been briefing U.S. policy makers on the new,
more worrisome CIA assessment, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   CIA and other national security officials declined on Monday to comment
directly on the report. But they agreed that the possibility of a nuclear-armed
Iran is a growing worry.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
United States was closely watching ``the issue of the availability of fissile
material to Iran. It has always been a concern to us.''
</P>
<P>
	   That concern has grown in the face of unsuccessful White House efforts to
persuade Russia not to provide missile and nuclear-power technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   Western military commanders regard Russia's still-huge nuclear arsenal with
trepidation and worry about declining military controls over the forces.
</P>
<P>
	   The new concerns come amid increased tensions between the United States and
Russia in the aftermath of the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia and the
expansion of NATO into former Warsaw Pact nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Moscow last week issued a new national-security doctrine that places more
emphasis on nuclear forces and takes a harder line toward the United States and
its allies.
</P>
<P>
	   Iran, meanwhile, has become a top customer of Russia's ailing defense
industry, purchasing fighter jets, missiles, tanks and submarines.
</P>
<P>
	   Intelligence analysts disagree on the pace of Iran's nuclear program and the
degree to which Tehran may be attempting to divert nuclear materials.
</P>
<P>
	   One reason for differing estimates, officials said, is difficulty in
monitoring the flow of these materials and technology into Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   As recently as last year, intelligence-community officials told
congressional intelligence panels that Iran might be able to test a missile that
could reach targets in the United States by 2010.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials now suggest the timetable might have to be shortened in light of
recent developments.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel, meanwhile, has accused China and North Korea of also selling Iran
the technology and know-how to build nuclear weapons and missiles to carry them.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon officials as well as military-minded members of Congress have used
the possibility of nuclear attacks from ``rogue'' nations like Iran or North
Korea as a major rationale for developing a national missile defense.

<HEADLINE> Profile of George W. Bush  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- His footsteps slowed by a nagging hangover, George W.
Bush paid little heed to the majestic Rockies rising nearby as he made his daily
three-mile run. He was feeling worse than usual after a boisterous night of
drinking with friends.
</P>
<P>
	   The night before, Bush, his wife and a half-dozen close friends from
Midland, Texas, had enjoyed a festive dinner at the elegant Broadmoor resort in
Colorado Springs, Colo., ordering five or six bottles of a pricey Cabernet
Sauvignon as they raised their glasses in successive toasts. They were there
that July 1986 weekend to celebrate the 40th birthdays of Bush and a pal,
Midland oilman Don Evans.
</P>
<P>
	   The evening, which came after 18 holes of golf and a visit to the Air Force
Academy's chapel, was ``nothing crazy,'' Evans recalled, just a group of
friends, fueled by wine, taking sentimental stock of their lives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We just had a loud, long dinner that night,'' said childhood friend Joe
O'Neill. ``We weren't asked to leave or anything.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the aftereffects dogged Bush's footsteps the next day. ``This run was
different,'' he recalled in his recent autobiography.
</P>
<P>
	   About halfway through, he made a decision: He would quit drinking.
</P>
<P>
	   When he told his wife Laura, she was skeptical. ``I'm not sure she believed
me, at first,'' said Bush, who was known for being the life of the party since
his days as a frat boy at Yale.
</P>
<P>
	   A spiritual awakening that had begun a year earlier ``helped me quit
drinking,'' Bush, 53, said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. So
did a growing realization that drinking could jeopardize his relationships, his
health and his career. Bush's Texas oil business was going through tough times
as well, with severely depressed oil prices bringing an uncomfortable level of
debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Friends have suggested that Bush's decision was driven partly by concern
that he not do anything to embarrass his father, George Bush, the vice president
who was gearing up for a run for the White House. Months after the Broadmoor
dinner, the younger Bush would uproot his family from Midland and move to
Washington to serve as his father's ``loyalty enforcer'' and the campaign's link
to religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   The younger Bush, now in the midst of his own campaign, offers a different
explanation.

	   ``I am a person who enjoys life, and for years, I enjoyed having a few
drinks,'' the Texas governor wrote in his book. ``But gradually, drinking began
to compete with my energy. I'd be a step slower getting up. My daily runs seemed
harder after a few too many drinks the night before.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, who had a fondness for bourbon and beer, also had some awkward run-ins
while drinking.
</P>
<P>
	   In one episode, The Wall Street Journal's then-Washington bureau chief, Al
Hunt, recalled being accosted by a ``clearly lubricated'' Bush in a Dallas
restaurant in 1986, and sworn at for some perceived slight against Bush's
father. Bush called Hunt to apologize after the anecdote surfaced in a Bush
biography, ``First Son,'' published in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush credits his wife, who had been nudging him to quit drinking, with
helping him. But Laura Bush says he is solely responsible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everyone quits everything by themselves,'' she said in an interview. ``So
he did that. George is very disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
	   The decision, which Bush describes as a turning point in his life, came
during an unusually introspective period.
</P>
<P>
	   The previous summer of 1985, a fireside chat about religion with the Rev.
Billy Graham at the Bush family retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine, launched Bush
on a spiritual quest that friends say sharpened his interest in public service.
Graham had been staying with the family for a weekend, and one night the elder
Bush asked the evangelist to answer questions on faith.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't remember the exact words. It was more the power of his example,''
the younger Bush wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush long had attended church, taught Sunday school and served on church
committees. But it wasn't until the meeting with Graham that he began to deepen
his faith in what one Bible study classmate, Don Jones, called ``a long struggle
up a steep hill.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think George sensed that there was a spiritual void in his life,'' said
Jones, a Midland oil and natural gas company executive. ``I think a lot of
people who are Christians or proclaim to be Christians really and truly haven't
been converted.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, who describes Graham as his religious mentor, said the famous
evangelist ``planted the seed in my heart that grew over time.''
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview at his Austin campaign headquarters, Bush said: ``I was a
married man, raising kids, prior to forty. I'd been a Sunday school teacher, I'd
been a Little League coach, running a business. I had a life that was a
responsible life. But there was something missing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My acceptance of Christ has provided kind of a sense of comfort and
strength, a renewed purpose that I hadn't had in my life prior to that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, who has been faulted by some for injecting religion into politics by
stating that Jesus Christ was the most influential thinker in his life, rejects
the criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If people want to know me, they've got to know that's an integral part of
my life -- my acceptance of Christ. It changed me,'' he told a reporter. ``But I
want people to hear this: That's not a reason to vote for me, and it wasn't a
reason for people to vote for me for governor. .... It's just a part of my life,
it's just part of the calculations that people are going to have to make about
me.''

<HEADLINE> Experts Continue Israel-Syria Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Israel and Syria each will send a pair of experts to
Washington to try and whittle away at their differences on how to reach a
land-for-peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   But with full-scale negotiations suspended indefinitely, the outlook is
cloudy.
</P>
<P>
	   All main issues remain in dispute -- borders, peace terms, security, water
-- and top Clinton administration officials are searching for a formula to put
the talks back on track.
</P>
<P>
	   At the windup of a round of negotiations last Monday in Shepherdstown,
W.Va., a nine-day recess was set to give Israel and Syria time to consider a
U.S.-drafted document designed as a basis for an eventual accord.
</P>
<P>
	   In a setback to American diplomacy, however, the administration was forced
Monday to call off the scheduled next round amid sharp disagreement between the
Middle East neighbors over a projected Israeli pullback on the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and senior U.S. mediator Dennis Ross
telephoned Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa to
try to find a way to move ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   The indefinite suspension was announced in Jerusalem, where Barak had been
preparing to return to Shepherdstown for the scheduled round of talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it isn't comfortable for the Syrians to come now, and they need some
time, they should take the time,'' Barak said. ``We will come when there are
discussions, and the delay, if in fact it is agreed on, does not bother us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Syria had hesitated over the weekend. It was frustrated that the
negotiations did not met its territorial demands, a promised pullback by Israel
from all of the Golan, a strategic border plateau.
</P>
<P>
	   Disclosure via an Israeli leak that Syria had offered Israel diplomatic
relations, as well as arrangements on trade, tourism and transportation, may
have contributed to Syria's frustration.
</P>
<P>
	   In Damascus, an informed Syrian source said Monday that Syria had not
suggested the delay, but al-Sharaa concluded from telephone conversations with
Albright that Israel was not serious.
</P>
<P>
	   Al-Sharaa told Albright the Syrians would not participate in a third round
until the Israelis were prepared to demarcate a new border at the line prior to
the Six-Day War in 1967, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Had the United States insisted on proceeding with the negotiations
Wednesday, a senior U.S. official said at the State Department, they would have
been held. In fact, he said, Israel and Syria had not proposed changes in the
U.S.-prepared document.
</P>
<P>
	   With the two sides in sharp disagreement on how to proceed, however, each
insisting its priority demands be dealt with first, the outlook for progress was
not bright.
</P>
<P>
	   For Syria, that demand is recovery of the Golan Heights, which Israel
captured in 1967, all the way to the Sea of Galilee, Israel's water source.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel and Syria agreed to send two experts from each side to Washington to
work on issues that are not central to the negotiations. After that, the
administration will decide how to proceed, said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Albright blamed neither side for the postponement. She said
only that their approaches to the U.S.-prepared document differed.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, before the talks were postponed, Clinton sounded an
optimistic note.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The good news is, I'm convinced that both still want to do it,'' he said
during a Martin Luther King Jr. Day appearance. ``And they are not as far apart
as they might be. They're not as far apart as they have been.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prodding Israel and Syria to the negotiating table after an impasse of
almost four years was considered a diplomatic accomplishment for the
administration. It raised hopes that Clinton might be able to preside over the
closing of the circle of peace in the Middle East with Israel coming to terms
with both Syria and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   The president is due to meet Thursday at the White House with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat. A deadline for the outline of an overall settlement with
Israel is less than a month away.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak and Arafat had planned a three-way meeting with Clinton if the
negotiations with Syria were held.

US Keeping Eye on Iran Nuke Program
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- National security officials are increasingly worried that
Iran, with help from Russia, may be closer than previously believed to producing
nuclear weapons. Among the chief concerns, said administration officials, is the
continued flow of technology to Tehran, primarily from Russia. U.S. officials
reacted with alarm to reports over the weekend that Iran may order an additional
three nuclear reactors from Russia. Russian engineers are already building one
reactor at a site in southern Iran under an existing contract.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Russia has formally objected to Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's decision to appoint Rolf Ekeus of Sweden chief weapons inspector
for Iraq, throwing the nomination into doubt and marking an ominous start to a
new U.N. policy for Baghdad. Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov sent a letter
Monday evening to the Security Council president informing him that Moscow
"cannot agree with the proposal," a U.S. official said, reading from the letter.
The president, U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, scheduled council
consultations for this afternoon to discuss the matter.

	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley challenged Vice President Al Gore
Monday night to demand the administration issue an immediate order banning
racial profiling, but Gore shot back in campaign debate, "I don't think
President Bill Clinton needs a lecture from Bill Bradley" on standing up for
blacks and Hispanics. Perched on stools on a debate stage in Iowa's capital
city, both men said firmly they oppose racial profiling, the practice by which
some police offers target racial minorities for traffic stops. A number of
racially sensitive issues came up in the hour-long televised debate on the

Income Gap Widens for U.S. Families

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The boom on Wall Street is widening the income gap
between the poorest and richest U.S. families, according to a report by two
Washington think tanks. The earnings for the poorest fifth of American families
rose less than 1 percent between 1988 and 1998 but jumped 15 percent for the
richest fifth, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Economic
Policy Institute said in their report issued Tuesday. Income for the poorest
families -- defined as two or more relatives living together -- rose $110 to

Bradley and Sen. John McCain get a lot of respect from New Hampshire voters, and

Ecuador Indians Want President Out

the resignation of President Jamil Mahuad. Mahuad has been the target of
increasing calls from across the political spectrum to resign because of his

point short of the club record for most consecutive points scored and it helped

emotional night when the team tried to take another step in its recovery from
the shock of losing Phills.

<HEADLINE> GM To Start Child-Seat Checkup Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- A minivan will appear in every state soon with equipment
to check whether parents have installed child seats correctly in their cars.
</P>
<P>
	   General Motors Corp. is supplying the Chevrolet Venture minivans -- one for
each of the 50 states plus a minivan for the District of Columbia. The National
Safe Kids Campaign will be hosting the traveling car-seat checkups at GM
dealerships, day care centers and shopping malls throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The mobile minivans will start up the week of February 13, GM said today.
</P>
<P>
	   Each year, frustrated parents struggle to install about 70 models of child
car seats in hundreds of types of cars with different back seat shapes.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 80 percent of child seats are improperly installed in automobiles,
and about 30 percent of children ride completely unrestrained. Properly used
child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in half, according to government
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1996, GM has worked with Safe Kids, a nonprofit group that promotes
child safety, to host weekend or daylong child safety seat checks at GM
dealerships. More than 25,000 car seats have been checked during the
multimillion-dollar campaign at about 1,500 GM dealerships, GM said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the next step. We need to go into the communities," said Kate
Milner of Safe Kids. "There are so many parents who don't live near a
dealership."
</P>
<P>
	   Milner said parents should contact their local Safe Kids coalition for
details about when the minivan would be in their area.

<HEADLINE> Fuel 'Gunk' Grounds Aussie Planes  </HEADLINE>
   By ROHAN SULLIVAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- From Wagga Wagga to Wee Waa, Rockhampton to
Lightning Ridge, towns in the vast Australian Outback depend on small planes to
deliver the mail, dust crops, round up cattle, shuttle schoolchildren, bring in
doctors and evacuate medical emergencies.
</P>
<P>
	   For more than a week, half the nation's light aircraft have been grounded
because of contaminated aviation fuel that thickens when it contacts copper and
brass engine parts, raising the risk of clogged fuel lines and motors stalling
in flight.
</P>
<P>
	   Nobody knows how many planes actually carry the bad fuel. The source of the
contamination -- Mobil Oil Australia Ltd., a subsidiary of U.S.-based Exxon
Mobil Corp. -- has no test to find out, and there is no known method to clean
contaminated systems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a contamination crisis of a magnitude that has never been seen
before anywhere in the world,'' said Mick Toller, safety director for the Civil
Aviation Safety Authority, which ordered the planes grounded.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists are working on a three-stage field diagnosis they hope will
identify which aircraft have tainted fuel. But pending further tests, grounded
planes would not be in the air before Thursday, Toller said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The fuel contaminant affects piston-driven engines that turn propellers in
aircraft ranging from single-engine Cessnas up to planes that carry a dozen or
so passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   Bigger turboprop aircraft are not affected, so there is no disruption to
major airlines. But hundreds of charter services and flight training schools
have shut down. In Victoria state, wildfire-fighting crews scaled back
operations, as did the national Royal Flying Doctor Service.
</P>
<P>
	   The air force grounded three of its 14 Caribou transport planes, including
one in East Timor, where Australia is leading the peacekeeping force, until
engine parts were replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   Just before Christmas, pilots started reporting discoloration in some fuel.
The aviation authority told the pilots not to fly until they had checked and, if
necessary, cleaned their fuel systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, on Jan. 10, the authority grounded all aircraft that had filled their
tanks from batches of Avgas 100/130 produced at Mobil's plant in Altona, a
suburb of Melbourne, from Nov. 21 to Dec. 23. The affected fuel had been
distributed throughout Australia's eastern states. Scientists had found the
tainted fuel could set off a chemical chain reaction, producing a viscous
material that can clog fuel lines and cause motors to stall.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What dreadful gunk,'' Bill Hamilton, president of the Aircraft Owners' and
Pilots' Association, said as he examined the substance last week. ``You wouldn't
put that in your lawn mower, would you?''
</P>
<P>
	   Mobil says it inadvertently altered the refining cycle for Avgas 100/130 at
the plant Nov. 21 and added corrosion retardants out of the proper sequence,
which left traces of ethyl diamine in the finished product. The thick
contaminant forms when the ethyl diamine reacts with copper and brass engine
components, Mobil said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fuel crisis is crippling Australia's network of small airports, flight
schools, charter services and bush pilots, an industry worth $330 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
	   In hangars and on runways across eastern Australia, planes stand idle and
owners are canceling orders and laying off pilots and mechanics. Operators say
weekly losses are running at $8 million. Airport owners on Friday threatened
legal action against Mobil to recover losses.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, lawyers for two aircraft operators lodged class-action lawsuits
against Mobil to recover losses.
</P>
<P>
	   Airport owners have threatened to do the same.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides potential compensation claims, Mobil faces a huge cleanup bill and a
government investigation into the cause of two helicopter crashes during flight
tests.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Mobil announced a $10 million financial-assistance plan for
operators who ``face immediate financial hardship'' as a result of the crisis.
But the company said it was not admitting liability, and measures to fix
clients' business losses were yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal Transport and Safety Bureau says it is looking into reports that
the contamination occurred before Nov. 21, and that it contributed to the two
helicopter accidents, both of which occurred before that date. The flight tests
were near ground level, and no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Mobil has said it will pay cleanup costs where contamination is found. At a
meeting with pilots last Thursday, however, the company refused to discuss
compensation, said Hamilton, the head of the pilots and owners group.
</P>
<P>
	   Acting Prime Minister John Anderson said the government would defer fees for
air traffic control services and has urged banks not to foreclose on small air
operators who miss loan repayments.

<HEADLINE> Crane Seeks Committee Chairmanship  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER LOVEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Philip Crane is the most senior Republican in the
House and holds the second-ranking slot on one of Congress' premier committees.
</P>
<P>
	   The former presidential candidate has for decades been a passionate advocate
of such rock-ribbed conservative principles as smaller government and the
elimination of federal arts funding.
</P>
<P>
	   All that would seem to put the 16-term congressman from Chicago's northwest
suburbs firmly in line to take over the tax-writing House Ways and Means
Committee next year when the current chairman, Rep. Bill Archer of Texas,
retires.
</P>
<P>
	   Think again.
</P>
<P>
	   Crane likely faces a stiff challenge from Rep. Bill Thomas, the hard-driving
Californian who heads its health subcommittee and is the third-ranking
Republican on Ways and Means.
</P>
<P>
	   Crane does not relish the contest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have fought the good fight for 30 years,'' he said. ``Historically, we
didn't have to go through these battles. I have waited for that job for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
	   If he becomes chairman, Crane intends to focus on trade and a massive
overhaul of the tax code. He's been pressing for a flat tax for more than two
decades.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have an atrocious tax system, the bureaucracy is unconscionable and we
need reform,'' Crane said.
</P>
<P>
	   Though congressional observers say otherwise, a Thomas spokesman insists the
11-term congressman hasn't committed to seeking the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's been focused on streamlining Medicare, cutting taxes and working to
increase our majority in the House,'' Jason Poblete said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other names further down the committee roster also have been mentioned
as possible successors: Rep. Clay Shaw, a 10-term veteran from Florida, and Rep.
Rob Portman of Ohio, a relative newcomer and Archer protege.
</P>
<P>
	   Of course, all the behind-the-scenes maneuvering would be moot if Democrats
regain control of the House in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, some see a heated battle between Crane and Thomas, and regard the
floating of less-senior alternatives as a sign that neither is a shoo-in.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP lawmakers vote for chairmen, after recommendations by a steering
committee. But the decision will be shaped primarily by House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, Crane's Illinois colleague and friend.
</P>
<P>
	   The loyalty factor certainly will come into play, as will the long-standing
tradition of having the most senior committee member take over a vacant
chairmanship. Deviating from that practice could invite jostling on other,
lesser committees.
</P>
<P>
	   Committee watchers are loathe to discuss the tussle. But many say privately
it presents a tough choice: Crane has done the time but has not been forceful on
many key tax debates, while Thomas has worked hard but made enemies with his
aggressive style.
</P>
<P>
	   Crane, as chairman of the Ways and Means trade subcommittee, has fervently
promoted U.S. trade with China as well as the nations of sub-Saharan Africa and
the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
	   But he has never established a reputation as a real player in the
legislative process and he ran into trouble with former Speaker Newt Gingrich,
who felt he raised too little money for fellow Republicans to deserve the
chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas, meanwhile, is the House Republicans' point man on Medicare and other
contentious, high-profile health issues. He also is chairman of the House
Administration Committee, which oversees congressional operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Though he raises money prodigiously for other members -- giving $550,000 to
GOP candidates in 1998 -- Thomas has a reputation for belligerence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a hands-on policy person,'' Poblete said. ``He's tough. But you don't
win anything in this town by being a wallflower.''
</P>
<P>
	   Crane believes he's never been given proper credit for his work on trade and
his fund-raising efforts. But, to boost his profile, he has raised more money --
donating $98,000 in 1998 and $47,000 in the first half of 1999 -- and
established a political action committee dedicated solely to bringing in cash
for GOP candidates.

<HEADLINE> 100 Sioux Seize Pine Ridge Office  </HEADLINE>
   By CHET BROKAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PINE RIDGE, S.D. (AP) -- About 100 Oglala Sioux who have taken over tribal
headquarters to protest alleged financial mismanagement are refusing to budge
until the governing council steps down.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not giving up here until these demands are met,'' group spokesman
Dale Looks Twice said Monday. ``But we don't anticipate violence unless they
pursue the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're a peaceful group. We've got women and children in this building.
We're unarmed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The group, which is allied with tribal President Harold Dean Salway, took
control of the building on the Pine Ridge Reservation on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters are calling for an audit and have demanded the immediate
resignation of Treasurer Wesley ``Chuck'' Jacobs and all 17 members of the
council. They also have asked the FBI to seize tribal records dealing with law
enforcement, housing and other programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The bottom line is, we want accountability and responsibility by our
elected officials,'' Looks Twice said.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the council have voted to throw the protesters out of the
building and have tribal law officers enforce bans on the spread of false
propaganda and actions that interfere with council business.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, federal agents seized paper files and computer records from the
Oglala Sioux Housing Authority. U.S. Attorney Ted McBride said the warrant was
related to an investigation of programs funded by the Department of Housing and
Urban Development.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Seek AIDS Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aiming to step up AIDS treatment and prevention programs,
President Clinton will ask Congress to increase federal spending against the
disease by $175 million in his 2001 budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Administration officials said on Monday that Clinton will request $125
million over this year's spending level for Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS
Resources Act grants and $50 million additional for prevention efforts at the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
	   CDC prevention programs are to receive $695 million in 2000 and the Ryan
White grant program $1.6 billion this year, although budget cuts Clinton agreed
to with Congress last year could reduce those amounts.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ryan White program, which marks its 10-year anniversary this year,
provides money for health clinics treating low-income AIDS patients and for
training for those caring for HIV-infected individuals.
</P>
<P>
	   Named after an Indiana teen whose battle with AIDS attracted national
attention, the program has received $6.4 billion in federal funding since it
began in 1990, the year White died. More than 500,000 people -- many of whom
have no insurance -- have received care each year.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC supports state, local and community-based prevention programs.
Administration officials say the $50 million proposal for the fiscal year that
begins Oct. 1 is the largest increase in prevention money that Clinton has ever
sought. AIDS groups that have been pressuring the White House to boost funding
for prevention say it's not enough.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a disappointment,'' said Steven Fisher, spokesman of the advocacy
group AIDS Action. ``We think $100 million is needed to make a dent.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is to unveil his budget Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC estimates that as many as 900,000 people are infected with HIV in
the United States, with new infections holding steady at roughly 40,000 a year
for the last decade. AIDS killed 17,047 people in 1998, down dramatically from
1995, when 49,351 died from the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   While AIDS deaths are down thanks to new treatments, the disease is hitting
minority groups and women hard.
</P>
<P>
	   Blacks, who make up about 13 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for
49 percent of AIDS deaths in 1998, according to the CDC. Thirty-two percent of
deaths were among whites and 18 percent were among Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 23 percent of AIDS diagnoses reported in 1998 were among women.

<HEADLINE> Gays in Military Ads To Be Aired  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to influence public opinion and the presidential
debate, a gay rights group is airing a new television ad that goes after
Republicans who would keep them out of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad, being unveiled today in New Hampshire and Iowa, responds to a
campaign by the Republican National Committee spotlighting the controversy
surrounding Vice President Al Gore's position on gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Republican presidential candidates are so busy fighting about who can
and cannot serve in the military, they may have forgotten the values we actually
fight for,'' says the 30-second ad produced by the Human Rights Campaign, a
Washington-based gay advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
	   The group is spending $30,000 to air the ad over five days in Iowa beginning
today and four days in New Hampshire starting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The group accuses Republicans of exploiting Gore's position on the issue and
hopes the ad campaign will help focus attention on the merits of his views --
that gays should be allowed to serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   In a debate this month, Gore said he would require officers on the Joint
Chiefs of Staff to share his position on the matter. He later backtracked,
saying that his appointees would simply be required to implement his policy.
</P>
<P>
	   But the clarification did not stop the RNC from running $10,000 worth of ads
accusing Gore of setting up a litmus test that former Gens. Colin Powell and
Norman Schwartzkopf couldn't pass.
</P>
<P>
	   The gay rights ad does not name any one Republican, but includes footage
from a GOP debate of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer. Bush and McCain have said they would continue
President Clinton's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, which allows gays to serve
in the military as long as they do not acknowledge their homosexuality. The
other GOP candidates want to ban their service altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   The RNC ad features shots of soldiers at work, of Powell and Schwartzkopf
and ends with: ``Call Al Gore. Tell him the only litmus test ought to be for
patriotism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, who have essentially the same position on
the issue, are competing for liberal voters who participate in Democratic
primaries and are generally supportive of gay rights. But the RNC hopes the
issue will come back to hurt the eventual nominee in the general election, when
the competition is for more moderate voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Human Rights Campaign is hoping to influence not just the
debate but public opinion.
</P>
<P>
	   Its ad says the military is fighting for core values: ``Equality, fairness,
freedom, justice -- for all Americans, including gay Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The purpose of this campaign is to refocus the debate on the core values
we think should drive it,'' said David M. Smith, the group's spokesman. ``The
debate has been sorely lacking of any substance. The candidates have basically
gotten away with simply platitudes.''

<HEADLINE> Details Fuzzy in Democratic Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Race relations was the focus of the latest Democratic
presidential debate, and most of the talk was about vision and philosophy. But
on the nuts and bolts of health and education policy, the details didn't always
square with the facts.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore continued to misrepresent the details of his rival's
Medicaid plan and Bill Bradley neglected to say the 600,000 new public school
teachers he is promising would take a decade to arrive.
</P>
<P>
	   The sharpest difference between the two continues to concern health care.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley wants to replace Medicaid, a system run by the states, with
subsidies allowing people to buy health insurance from the system that serves
federal employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore repeated his assertion that Bradley's plan would give them just $150
per month to buy a health plan. But the $150 figure is the average subsidy for a
single person, not a family. A family actually would get $417 per month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is a serious misrepresentation in this debate,'' said Kathleen Hall
Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of
Pennsylvania, who has been monitoring the debates.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also stretched the facts on health care, saying the new Children's
Health Insurance Program isn't working because only a fraction of eligible
children are enrolled.
</P>
<P>
	   The program, which just finished its second year, doubled enrollment in 1999
to about 2 million kids, but there isn't enough money to serve all of the
eligible children anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   Plus, there's no guarantee that Bradley's plan, which would be administered
by the federal government, would do a better job at signing families up for
insurance. In fact, it might be harder, since managing it from Washington would
create new challenges.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore promised to sign an executive order banning racial profiling, where
police stop drivers or question certain people because of their race. But after
the debate, Gore's own campaign noted that most law enforcement agencies are run
by state and local governments and wouldn't be affected by a presidential order.
</P>
<P>
	   On education, Bradley touted his plan to put 600,000 ``qualified, great
teachers'' into public schools. Jamieson called it an exaggeration. ``He has no
way to guarantee they are going to be qualified or great,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   And Bradley didn't mention that it would take 10 years to pay for all of
them.
</P>
<P>
	   Moving to school vouchers, which provides public money for kids to go to
private schools, Gore's camp made an error that Bradley didn't correct. Like
many Democrats, Gore opposes school vouchers, saying they drain dollars from
public schools, and he regularly notes that Bradley has supported a variety of
voucher experiments.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said in the debate that he was encouraged that Bradley now opposes
vouchers. But, in fact, Bradley has not said he opposes them -- only that he
doesn't think they are the answer to the problems of public education.
</P>
<P>
	   Both men noted several times that the debate was taking place on Martin
Luther King Jr. Day, and Gore added that this was the first year that New
Hampshire is calling its holiday just that. He credited Gov. Jeanne Shaheen --
one of his supporters -- for making it happen. But her Republican predecessor,
Gov. Steve Merrill, also fought to name the holiday after the slain civil rights
leader.
</P>
<P>
	   And while Gore tried for extra credit by noting that the first baby born in
Iowa this year was black, it may have backfired. ``Latino!'' came a cry from the
audience.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Iowa's millennium birth was to a Latina woman.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Clash on Racial Profiling  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- In their final debate before Iowa voters launch the
presidential nominating season with the caucuses next week, Democratic rivals Al
Gore and Bill Bradley scuffled over the issue of racial profiling but agreed
that the Confederate battle flag should no longer be allowed to fly above the
South Carolina Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Gore and Bradley, a former senator, also stated their support
for affirmative action policies during the hourlong forum on racial issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Both men pledged to quickly end racial profiling, but the liveliest moment
of Monday evening's debate came when Bradley pressed Gore to demand that
President Clinton issue an executive order immediately ending the practice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want you to walk down his hallway, walk into his office and say 'sign
this executive order today,''' Bradley said, drawing a sharp retort from Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think President Bill Clinton needs a lecture from Bill Bradley on
how to stand up and fight for African-Americans'' and Hispanics, said Gore, who
argued that Clinton has set records in appointing minorities to key
administration posts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's one thing to talk the talk, it's another thing to walk the walk,''
said Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Racial profiling is a police practice where some officers target minority
group members for traffic stops. Bradley has made boosting racial harmony a
centerpiece of his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The focus on minority issues, in a debate televised nationally by the cable
channel MSNBC, came hours after protests in South Carolina, where civil rights
leaders demanded that the Confederate battle flag be lowered from atop the South
Carolina Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   Both rivals firmly agreed that the flag should be lowered, but Gore said he
had no plans to boycott the state as some leaders have suggested.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do not think a president of the United States should ever boycott an
individual state,'' said Gore, who criticized Republican presidential candidates
as being about the only base of support for keeping the flag flying. None of the
GOP candidates have called for the flag's removal; most of them say the people
of South Carolina should decide.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's only the Republican candidates for president who are so scared of the
right wing that they will tolerate the intolerant, lest they offend the
offensive,'' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is an offense to our common humanity,'' Bradley said of displaying the
flag.
</P>
<P>
	   Both also condemned Atlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker, under fire for
making racist remarks about minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would not be disappointed if they fired him,'' said Bradley. ``Certainly
suspension is in order.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said Rocker's comments were reprehensible and disgusting. ``And I
condemn it without any reservation, of course,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The debate came on the federal holiday honoring slain civil rights leader
Martin Luther King Jr., and both men were sounding their themes of racial unity
at a wider audience, since Iowa's minority population is under 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the sixth face-to-face exchange between the two competitors and it
came as most polls show Gore with a significant lead of 20 percentage points or
more in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   After the debate, Gore went to an African-American church jammed with about
700 people, declaring ``I felt the spirit'' as the choir sang. Gore stood in
front of the choir swaying with the music and clapping in time.
</P>
<P>
	   He praised the debate, arguing that ``these are issues that should be raised
in every state in every city across the nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   An ebullient Bradley headed for a post-debate party at the local Painters
union hall that rocked to the groove of Michael Jackson's music. With blue
curtains hanging from the wall and lights glaring, the place had been
transformed into a temporary TV studio as a campaign film crew gathered footage
for the next round of ads.
</P>
<P>
	   On other issues, the two rivals:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Agreed that the father of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy at the
center of an international dispute, should come to the United States to seek
custody of him. Both candidate's positions have evolved on the issue of the
youngster's future.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Said they favored the policy that allows Cuban refugees who successfully
reach this country to remain here, unlike those from other nations, such as
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Emphasized their commitment to minority issues. Bradley noted that his
German-born wife Ernestine ``would be the first immigrant first lady in the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   -- Pledged to be strong on appointing minorities to administration posts.
``I will make sure that the administration I lead will present the diversity of
the country,'' said Bradley. Gore said he was very proud to be a part of the
``Clinton-Gore administration that has broken every record'' on diversity.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Renewed their fight over health care. Gore routinely argues that
minorities would suffer under Bradley's proposal because Medicaid would be
eliminated. Bradley demurred when asked whether the charges amounted to
``race-baiting.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``No, I don't think they border on race-baiting,'' he said. ``I do think
they tend to divide people.''

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Battle Over Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Locked in a tight presidential contest with Sen.
John McCain among New Hampshire voters, George W. Bush pressed on with his
criticism of the Arizona senator's tax plan, hoping it will put him ahead in
public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's about six polls out, most of 'em showing us close, but there's a
lot of time, I've got a lot of work to do,'' Bush, the Texas governor, said
Monday night upon arriving here after a one-day break from the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I like my chances, I like my message. I like the idea of pointing out that
his tax reform is going to raise taxes on people here in this state, and I
intend to make that an issue,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two rivals for the Republican presidential nomination renewed at a
distance the argument that began Saturday when Bush said in a debate that
McCain's tax proposal would impose ``a $40 billion tax increase'' on certain
employer-provided benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   The architect of McCain's plan said Monday that Bush was wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Spitzer, a Phoenix tax attorney, said McCain's proposal is to end the
deductions employers can now take on tax-exempt benefits they give their
workers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It does nothing to the employees,'' said Spitzer, an Arizona state
senator.
</P>
<P>
	   The New Hampshire primaries are Feb. 1, eight days after the Jan. 24 Iowa
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   A new ABC News-Washington Post poll showed McCain in a statistical dead heat
here with Bush, leading 40 percent to 36 percent among likely Republican primary
voters -- but within the 4-percentage point margin of error. The survey was
conducted Jan. 13-16.
</P>
<P>
	   A Dartmouth College-Associated Press poll, conducted Jan. 9-12 and released
Sunday, showed McCain leading Bush 42 percent to 33 percent among likely
Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain says Bush has mischaracterized his proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're talking about income taxes,'' said McCain campaign spokesman
Howard Opinsky. ``We're talking about payroll taxes.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign based its assertion on Congressional Research Service
estimates of the revenue loss due to the tax-free treatment of non-retirement
fringe benefits aside from health insurance coverage and child care, which
wouldn't be affected.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's $40 billion claim reflects those estimates extended for five years
after the next administration takes over. But the numbers are based on taxes
paid by individuals, not their employers.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush advocates a five-year, $483 billion tax cut, and says the only way to
be certain that projected budget surpluses aren't spent by Congress is to refund
most of the money to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's alternative is a $237 billion overall cut, the closing of what he
calls tax loopholes to offset part of the cost, and the commitment of additional
budget surpluses to secure the financial future of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was campaigning in New Hampshire today and part of Wednesday before
returning to Iowa to campaign there exclusively until Monday's caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   He also was expected today to be endorsed by former Virginia Gov. George
Allen. Virginia's GOP primary is Feb. 29 and Bush already has been endorsed by
Gov. Jim Gilmore and other state Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who is not actively campaigning in Iowa, planned to spend most of
the week in New York and New England, attending fund-raisers and other campaign
events.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire on Monday, McCain said he can identify gay people by their
behavior and attitudes, the Washington Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   The topic came up as McCain engaged in freewheeling discussion -- as has
become his custom -- with the traveling press corps. He said he served in the
Navy with many gays, although he hadn't been told of their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked how he knew they were homosexual, McCain said: ``Well, I think we know
by behavior and by attitudes. I think that it's clear to some of us when some
people have that lifestyle.'' He later backtracked when pressed, saying ``I said
I had suspicions, and I think that -- I was told that they were (gay),'' the
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Poll Show Races Close in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican John McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley score
high marks with New Hampshire voters, who also think George W. Bush and Al Gore
give their respective parties the best chance for a November presidential
victory, a new poll says.
</P>
<P>
	   Both races are too close to call with two weeks to go before the nation's
first presidential primaries Feb. 1, according to an ABC-Washington Post poll
released today.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those planning to vote in the GOP primary, McCain, an Arizona senator,
had 40 percent to 36 percent for Bush. On the Democratic side, Bradley, a former
senator from New Jersey, claimed the support of 48 percent to Gore's 47 percent.
The differences in both races were within the poll's error margin.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey, of 2,223 New Hampshire adults -- including 733 likely Republican
primary voters and 534 likely Democratic primary voters -- was conducted
Thursday through Sunday. The error margin for the Republican and Democratic
samples was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain and Bradley do well when voters give their overall impressions of the
candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain fares very well with those who say they are likely to vote in the GOP
primary. He was viewed more favorably than Bush on nine of 11 traits measured in
the poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly three in four say the former Vietnam prisoner of war is ``an
inspiring candidate,'' while barely half say Bush inspired them. Similarly, more
Republicans see McCain as a strong leader, able to ``bring needed change to
Washington,'' and the most likely to tell the American people the truth ``even
if it's not politically popular.''
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, Democrats in New Hampshire rate Bradley as superior to Gore on a
majority of the traits measured, including bringing change to Washington, saying
what he thinks even if it's unpopular and being a more inspiring candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bush and Gore, front-runners in national polls, are both perceived by
those in their own parties as having the best chance of success in November, a
factor possibly balancing the good traits voters attribute to McCain and
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   More than seven in 10 New Hampshire voters, and a similar majority in the
national poll, said they want their next president to take ``small, steady
steps'' toward solving the nation's problems. Only one in five said they favor a
chief executive who would have ``big, new ideas.'' Bradley has said he is the
candidate of bold proposals, especially on health care.
</P>
<P>
	   Taxes, Social Security and Medicare top the issues that New Hampshire
Republicans say are important to them this election year. Among voters most
interested in taxes, Bush holds a double-digit lead over McCain. However,
Republicans are divided over whether Bush can cut taxes and keep the budget
balanced. And McCain has an advantage among GOP voters most concerned about
Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   Education, Social Security and Medicare were the issues most important to
the largest proportion of Democratic voters in the state. Gore has a modest
advantage over Bradley on education, while neither candidate had the edge on
Social Security, Medicare or health care reform.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Share Prices Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices fell Tuesday when investors cashed in on
the market's surge the previous day. The dollar dipped against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nikkei average of 225 issues closed at 19,196.57 points, down 240.66
points, or 1.24 percent, from the previous day. On Monday, the average rose
480.68 points, or 2.54 percent, to a 29-month high.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's gains marked the Nikkei's highest close since Aug. 8, 1997, when it
ended the day at 19,604.46 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was trading at 104.98 yen at 3 p.m. (1 a.m. EST) Tuesday, down
0.20 yen from late Monday's rate of 105.18 yen, but above its late London level
of 104.78 yen overnight. Financial markets in New York were closed Monday for a
national holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, high-priced, export-oriented blue chips saw some of the
biggest declines Tuesday, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Individual investors in particular moved to lock in gains following
Monday's surges. Many individual investors had especially been seeking to sell
off technology stocks after watching these issues remain top-heavy recently,"
said Hidenori Karaki, general manager of equities at Tokyo-Mitsubishi Personal
Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares in exporting companies were also hard hit by the yen's rise against
the greenback, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   A strong yen hurts Japanese exporters when they bring their
dollar-denominated profits back into Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section closed 61.13 points lower, down 0.96 percent, at 1,665.84. The TOPIX
closed up 33.73 points, or 2.05 percent, the day before.

	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Faced with a 110-degree temperature swing all in
one day, Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush could do little else
but cry.
</P>
<P>
	   After a day of rest at his Texas ranch, Bush got a bitter taste of the
brutal New England winters as he returned to New Hampshire to resume
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   Tears, brought on by cold weather, rolled down the Texas governor's face
Monday night as he stepped from his jet after a flight from Austin, where the
weather had been a balmy 75 degrees at takeoff.
</P>
<P>
	   Upon arrival in Manchester, N.H., the temperature was about 3 degrees. But
with the wind it felt more like 35 degrees below zero.
</P>
<P>
	   After taking a few questions from a shivering press corps, Bush hustled off
to his motorcade. ``Welcome to politics,'' he called out with a laugh.
</P>
<P>

	   BY THE NUMBERS:

<P>
	   47 -- percentage of Americans who were not aware that Bill Bradley played in
the National Basketball Association. (Pew Center, December 1999)
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   VOTER VOICE:
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm kind of impressed with what (Bill) Bradley has done. He's a Washington
insider but he's brought another approach to the race. It's almost like you can
plan on what Gore says before he says it.'' -- Tim Mason, 35, a
Republican-leaning software developer from Des Moines, Iowa, before Monday's
Democratic debate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I had to choose any of the Democrats I'd probably choose Gore because
of his Washington experience. If a Democrat would make it into office, Gore
would be the one.'' -- Susan Thompson, of Panora, Iowa, before the debate.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   THIS DATE FOUR YEARS AGO:
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan criticized rival GOP contender Steve Forbes' flat tax proposal
in an opinion piece in The New York Times. Bob Dole cautiously welcomed the
effort to find a ``fairer, flatter, simpler approach,'' to the federal tax code
but warned that any change must not shift more of the tax burden from the rich
to the middle class.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole made his remarks in Washington after a presentation of a report by a
panel headed by former Housing Secretary (and presidential contender) Jack Kemp.
Forbes said he saw the Kemp tax commission plan as ``a step forward.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   MONDAY ROUNDUP:
</P>
<P>
	   In their final debate before the Iowa caucuses, Democrats Bill Bradley and
Vice President Al Gore argued over the issue of racial profiling but agreed that
the Confederate battle flag should not fly above the South Carolina Capitol.
Prior to the debate, Gore attended the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial service
at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church and Bill Bradley attended events honoring
King in Iowa, suggesting King would think the Clinton administration's efforts
to end child poverty were ``not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush and John McCain continued haggling over their respective tax
plans. Bush said in an interview with the AP that he would ``continue to press
the issue'' by highlighting differences. McCain, in New Hampshire, said, ``Every
time we pass a tax bill, we put in a special deal, a special benefit for a
big-money-contributor special interest.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   TODAY'S TRAIL:
</P>
<P>
	   Democrat Bill Bradley will visit a high school in Iowa City before flying to
New Hampshire. Vice President Al Gore also will be in Iowa for rallies with
supporters before flying to New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush will spend the day campaigning in New Hampshire, including a
tour of a factory in Pittsfield. Sen. John McCain addresses the Nashua, N.H.,
Chamber of Commerce before heading to Rhode Island for a town hall and New York
for a fund-raiser. Steve Forbes continues his Iowa bus tour. Orrin Hatch will be
in New Hampshire where he will visit two schools and attend a forum on health
care.
</P>
<P>
	   Reform Party hopeful Pat Buchanan will discuss immigration policy at a
border town in Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Change Comes to Hispanic Group  </HEADLINE>
   By MADELINE BARO DIAZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) -- For 70 years, members of the League of United
Latin American Citizens' founding council prided themselves on unity, proud of
being the only such group in town.
</P>
<P>
	   The league -- which started fighting for desegregation and is now involved
with voter registration, education and immigration issues -- has more than 600
chapters nationwide. Many cities have multiple branches.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet in Corpus Christi, where the group was born in 1929, LULAC has always
had one local council.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, in September, Council No. 4444 was created by a past president of
Council No. 1 and 25 others who said they want to do more hands-on work in the
community.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's way past due,'' said Gonzalo Tamez, former president of LULAC's
founding council and now first vice president of the new group.
</P>
<P>
	   LULAC ``is the oldest organization and has continued to be very active,''
said Jose Hinojosa, a University of Texas political science professor. ``It
certainly stands out in its track record of achievement.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hinojosa says the Corpus Christi split shows leaders have found no middle
ground in their differing opinions about the direction of the group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There has always been a certain pride because it was the original founding
LULAC council there in Corpus,'' he said. ``In the past, it has been very
strong.''
</P>
<P>
	   Creation of the new chapter sparked talk that the move was prompted by the
election of Mary Helen Salazar as the founding council's president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the first woman president and these men couldn't work with a
woman,'' Manuel Gonzales, a board member for Council No. 1, told the Corpus
Christi Caller-Times.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Salazar said ``We didn't split,'' declining to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Villareal Way, the new council's president, said the panel wants to work on
scholarships, education and community involvement, while the founding council
sees civil rights issues as a higher priority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We saw that there was a void,'' he said. ``There's a lot of different
cities the same size as ours or bigger that have multiple chapters.''
</P>
<P>
	   The new council has close to 40 members, is sponsoring the startup of an
affiliated youth council and is planning a major event this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Brent Wilkes, LULAC's national executive director, said the last attempt for
a second council in Corpus Christi failed after a year in the early 1990s. Under
the organization's national delegate system, the more councils per city the more
representation they have, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides, he said, a city the size of Corpus Christi -- with a population of
260,000 -- typically has around four or five councils. And to Wilkes, more
groups won't dilute the power of the council that started it all.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's a natural evolution,'' he said. ``Different councils focus on
different things. There's nothing wrong with it and it's entirely healthy.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. To End Haiti Military Presence  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL NORTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Army Pfc. David Arndt had never seen a dead
body in the street before he came to Haiti. Army Sgt. Michael Hope will never
forget how children beamed with gratitude when U.S. soldiers handed them bottles
of water.
</P>
<P>
	   They are members of the U.S. Support Group, whose mission -- building roads
and bridges, drilling wells and giving health care to the poorest of slum
dwellers -- is ending. The support group is all that remains of the U.S.
contingent of 20,000 troops President Clinton sent to Haiti in 1994 to restore
the elected government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
</P>
<P>
	   Without fanfare, the U.S. flag will be lowered Thursday at Camp Fairwinds
for the last time, and the camp is scheduled to close the next day. The group's
242 Haitian employees will be laid off by Jan. 31, and the camp will be handed
over to the Airport Authority and may be used for Haitian police training.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Haitians fear the end of a permanent U.S. military presence will
increase the risk of unrest as Haiti prepares for local and legislative
elections on March 19. A police-training mission run by the United Nations is
scheduled to end March 15, at which time an unarmed mission is to take over.
</P>
<P>
	   But U.S. officials say Haiti has largely policed itself since 1995 with a
local police force deployed under U.N. supervision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We haven't been involved in internal Haitian security problems. There's no
reason to believe security will worsen after our departure,'' said Hope, one of
110 guards for the 197-member Support Group, which at one time had more than 400
members.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States also planned to start rotating units of between 150 and
200 noncombat troops -- engineers and medics -- on humanitarian missions around
the northern city of Cap-Haitien and the southern port of Jacmel. The first
``New Horizons'' mission is scheduled to run from Jan. 15 to March 31 in the
Cap-Haitien area, and a second from May to October.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics in the U.S. Congress say the Support Group mission, which has cost
$20 million a year since it began in 1996, hasn't promoted democracy in Haiti,
where elections were postponed after a fraud-marred 1997 vote. Congress also
opposes widespread U.S. deployments at a time when the military is having
problems recruiting and retaining troops.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Haitian politicians demanded the U.S. withdraw its troops, saying their
presence is an affront to national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been few overt expressions of hostility to the U.S. soldiers.
Haitians celebrating in the street once threw rocks at a U.S. patrol, Hope said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the soldiers defend their work here, saying they've gained key field
experience and have made a difference in the lives of many in this desperately
poor nation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I get a little sad when people back home say we shouldn't be here. I've
seen firsthand what we did, and I'm proud,'' said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Lana Hampton,
35, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   Support Group medics treated 138,000 Haitians in Port-au-Prince's slums and
at the base camp field hospital near the international airport. Troops
distributed more than 85 tons of donated goods and clothing and 180 tons of
other supplies. They also repaired 170 water wells -- desperately needed in
Haiti -- and drilled 40 more.
</P>
<P>
	   Group engineers built or repaired 50 schools, and constructed or repaired 12
miles of roads, a bridge and a boat ramp.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1992, Hope, a 28-year-old from Union Springs, N.Y., was assigned to the
U.S. Navy base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, guarding Haitian boat people who had
fled repressive military-backed rule. Haiti's bloodshed and refugee exodus to
Florida stopped after the 1994 U.S.-led invasion.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, hopes for a better life have dimmed. Haitians' poverty endures.
</P>
<P>
	   Arndt, 19, from Columbus, Ohio, looked out over the sandbags in his fox
tower at Camp Fairwinds. He said he'd been shaken up by the sight of bodies left
to rot on the roadside, victims of illness, accidents or crime. He also said
he'd been moved by the sympathy Haitians showed each other during the medics'
visits to Port-au-Prince's slums.
</P>
<P>
	   Those visits ended Dec. 8, and 45 of 66 medical personnel have been sent
home.
</P>
<P>
	   A giant sign in front of Camp Fairwinds depicts two arms, in the Haitian and
U.S. national colors, joined by a friendly handclasp. It will be pulled down
before the last four Support Group soldiers fly home Jan. 31.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- On the eve of what could be a record day in salary
arbitration, nine more players settled Monday and free agent John Burkett agreed
to a deal with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventy-eight players were set to exchange proposed salaries with their
teams Tuesday and the focus was on a pair of New York Yankees: shortstop Derek
Jeter and closer Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeter won $5 million in arbitration last winter and Rivera $4.25 million. It
was possible Jeter could exceed the record amount requested, $9 million by
teammate Bernie Williams in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   New York countered Williams at $7.5 million that winter, the most offered by
a team, and the sides settled at $8.25 million. After the season, when Williams
was a free agent, the Yankees signed him to an $87.5 million, seven-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Last January, when just 38 players swapped numbers with their teams, the
most asked for was $6.5 million, by Toronto first baseman Carlos Delgado.
</P>
<P>
	   Most players and teams settle before hearings. The highest award by an
arbitrator was the $5.3 million pitcher Jack McDowell got from the Chicago White
Sox in 1994 -- when he lost his case.
</P>
<P>
	   Settling Monday were San Diego right-handers Donne Wall ($2 million for two
years) and Brian Boehringer ($830,000); Padres outfielder Ruben Rivera
($700,000); Toronto first baseman David Segui ($4,325,000); Blue Jays
right-hander John Frascatore ($1.85 million for two years); San Francisco
right-hander Felix Rodriguez ($1.4 million for two years); Chicago Cubs
left-hander Felix Heredia ($625,000); Cincinnati left-hander Gabe White
($630,000); and Milwaukee outfielder Mark Sweeney ($515,000).
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati also got around to announcing a $1.6 million, one-year contract
with left-hander Ron Villone, a deal agreed to before players filed for
arbitration Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay, seeking to bolster its pitching after trading Rolando Arrojo,
agreed to a minor league contract with Burkett, who would get an $850,000 deal
if he's added to the roster and the chance to make $2,175,000 more in
performance bonuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Burkett, a 35-year-old right-hander, went 9-8 with a 5.62 ERA in 30 games
for Texas last year, including 5-1 with a 3.51 ERA in his last seven outings.
</P>
<P>
	   In 10 seasons with the Rangers, San Francisco and Florida, Burkett has
averaged 12 wins, 31 starts and 194 innings while going 119-101 with a 4.31 ERA.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the end of the season, the Devil Rays have acquired third baseman
Vinny Castilla from Colorado and signed pitchers Juan Guzman ($12.5 million for
two years) and Steve Trachsel ($1 million guaranteed), and outfielders Greg
Vaughn ($34 million for four years) and Gerald Williams ($5.75 million for two
years).
</P>
<P>
	   Catcher Tyler Houston, cut by Cleveland last month, agreed to a $835,000,
one-year contract.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Reports: Pack To Make Sherman Coach  </HEADLINE>
    By GREG BEACHAM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Mike Sherman, the Seattle Seahawks' offensive
coordinator and a former Green Bay assistant, will be hired as the new coach of
the Packers, a team source told The Associated Press on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The team scheduled a news conference at 10 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   A longtime college assistant coach with just three years of NFL experience,
Sherman suddenly emerged as general manager Ron Wolf's choice when the GM's
early favorites -- former Chiefs coach Marty Schottenheimer and Rams offensive
coordinator Mike Martz -- took themselves out of the running.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post-Crescent of Appleton and ESPN first reported Sherman's hiring.
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman and his agent were on their way to Green Bay on Monday night, the
source told The AP, speaking on condition of anonymity. Wolf was returning to
Green Bay from Mobile, Ala., where he was scouting at the Senior Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf fired Ray Rhodes and his staff on Jan. 3 after the Packers completed an
8-8 season, Rhodes' first in Green Bay. The GM cited a team-wide lack of
discipline and focus, and he vowed his new coach would create a
"well-disciplined, tough and hard-nosed football team."
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman, who has no head coaching experience, spent two years as Mike
Holmgren's tight ends coach in Green Bay before moving to Seattle with Holmgren
last January, where he doubled as offensive coordinator and tight ends coach.
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman apparently made a strong impression when Wolf interviewed him in
Green Bay on Saturday. Wolf said the search for Rhodes' replacement would be "a
lengthy process," yet he settled on Sherman just two weeks after firing Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf and team president Bob Harlan, who was traveling, did not return phone
calls Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Holmgren in 1992, Sherman comes to the Packers with no head coaching
experience, but a background in the disciplined, hard-nosed style of football
favored by Wolf.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf apparently chose a coach who would keep the West Coast offense that
brought the Packers their recent success and which three-time MVP quarterback
Brett Favre is most comfortable running.
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman was popular with Green Bay's players, including tight end Mark
Chmura, who made the Pro Bowl during each of Sherman's two seasons with the
Packers. Chmura missed all but two games of the 1999 season with a neck injury,
but expects to return next season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Packers missed the playoffs under Rhodes for the first time since 1992,
the first of Holmgren's seven years in Green Bay. Holmgren, who also came to the
Packers with no head coaching experience, led the Packers to consecutive Super
Bowl appearances in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The Packers broke off talks with Schottenheimer over the weekend, apparently
because Schottenheimer's salary demands would have been more than Wolf was
willing to pay. The Packers owe Rhodes and his staff at least $2 million next
season.
</P>
<P>
	   Martz signed a two-year extension with the Rams on Monday and removed
himself from consideration for any new jobs. Unlike Schottenheimer or Martz, the
Packers will not need to offer Sherman's former team compensation for his
services.
</P>
<P>
	   San Francisco head coach Steve Mariucci and Oakland head coach Jon Gruden,
both former Packers assistants liked by Wolf, would have been unable to get out
of their current contracts. Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez took himself out of
the running last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Before joining Holmgren in Green Bay, Sherman was an offensive line coach at
Texas A&AMP;M and UCLA from 1989-96.
</P>
<P>
	   He was hired as Texas A&AMP;M's offensive coordinator in 1997, but left for the
Packers before the season began. Sherman also was an assistant at Holy Cross,
Tulane and Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman was the offensive coordinator at Holy Cross from 1985-88. In
Seattle, he coordinated the team's offense but Holmgren called the plays, just
as Holmgren did with offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis during his seven
seasons in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman was one of eight assistant coaches Holmgren took with him from Green
Bay to Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Charismatic is Horse of the Year  </HEADLINE>
By ED SCHUYLER JR.-
AP Racing Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	Charismatic, who broke a leg while straining for a victory in the Belmont
Stakes and the Triple Crown championship, was honored as the Horse of the Year
for 1999 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	The strapping chestnut colt, a claiming horse in February and a Kentucky Derby
and Preakness winner in the spring, won the Eclipse Award as racing's top
performer in a split vote with Europe-based Daylami, winner of the Breeders' Cup
Turf on Nov. 6 in his only U.S. start.
</P>
<P>
	Bob Lewis, who with his wife Beverly, owns Charismatic, said he was guardedly
optimistic about the colt's chances.
</P>
<P>
	``I have to say to you, quite frankly, when you win two-thirds of the Triple
Crown and finishes third in the Belmont under conditions he did he deserves the
honor,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic finished third in the Belmont Stakes, 1 1/2 lengths behind winner
Lemon Drop Kid, while sustaining two fractures of his left front leg. The
breakdown apparently happened with about an eighth-mile remaining. His record
for the year was four wins, two seconds and a third, with earnings of
$2,007,404.
</P>
<P>
	Eclipse Award winners were honored Monday night at the Beverly Hills Hilton in
Beverly Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic registered 21 points to 16 for Daylami, who won the King George II
and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in England and the Irish Champion Stakes. Overall,
Daylami had four wins in seven starts.
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic received 10-point first-place votes from the Daily Racing Form and
the National Thoroughbred Writers Association, and one point for a third-place
vote from the National Thoroughbred Racing Association. Daylami got 10 points
from the NTRA, five from the DRF and one from the NTWA.
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis and trained by D. Wayne Lukas, was
the unanimous choice as 3-year-old champion, while Daylami was unanimous pick as
male turf champion.
</P>
<P>
	Daylami is owned by the Godolphin Racing operation of brothers Mohammed,
Maktoum and Hamdan al Maktoum of Dubai of the United Arab Emirates, and trained
by Saeed bin Suroor.
</P>
<P>
	``I think he deserves it,'' trainer Bob Baffert said of Charistmatic's Horse of
the Year victory.
</P>
<P>
	Baffert trained Silver Charm and Real Quiet, who won the Derby and Preakness
and finished second in the Belmont, respectively, in 1997-98. They won
3-year-old titles, but did not get Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
	Two Baffert horses won Eclipse Awards on Monday night, and Baffert beat Lukas
for Trainer of the Year. Baffert got the votes of the DRF and NTRA while the
NTWA voted for Lukas. Each vote in the human Eclipse categories was worth one
point.
</P>
<P>
	Baffert's Eclipse champions were Chilukki, 2-year-old filly, and
Silverbulletday, 3-year-old filly.
</P>
<P>
	Other equine winners were Anees, 2-year-old colt or gelding; Victory Gallop,
older colt, horse or gelding; Beautiful Pleasure, older filly or mare; Artax,
sprinter; Soaring Softly, female turf horse; and Lonesome Glory, steeplechase
horse.
</P>
<P>
	All of them were unanimous selections except Victory Gallop, who got 25 points
on first-place votes by the DRF and NTRA. Behrens got the NTWA's first-place
ballot and totaled 20 points.
</P>
<P>
	Other human award winners were Jorge Chavez, jockey; Ariel Smith, apprentice
jockey; Frank Stronich, owner; and William S. Farish and partners, breeder.

<HEADLINE> Spurs 99, Clippers 93  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- David Robinson scored a season-high 38 points and Tim
Duncan added 23 as the San Antonio Spurs held off the late-charging Los Angeles
Clippers 99-93 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Duncan had 13 rebounds and Robinson had 11 for the defending NBA champions,
who beat the Clippers for the eighth straight time and dealt them their fifth
straight loss overall.
</P>
<P>
	   Maurice Taylor had 22 points and 12 rebounds, and Derek Anderson added 17
points for the Clippers, who have lost nine of 10.
</P>
<P>
	   The Spurs pulled away to a 94-81 lead with an 11-2 spurt, capped by Malik
Rose's layup with 6:13 to play. During the run, Robinson accidentally elbowed
Duncan in the left side of the head while going for a defensive rebound --
forcing Duncan to the sidelines for about four minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Clippers guard Eric Piatkowski scored seven straight points to trim the
Spurs' lead to 96-88, then sank three free throws with 1:24 remaining after
Avery Johnson fouled him beyond the 3-point stripe. But 96-93 was as close as
the Clippers got, as Johnson redeemed himself with a clinching layup with 29
seconds remaining and Duncan pulled down two critical defensive rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor received a cut over his left eye when he was fouled by Mario Elie
with 8:55 left in the third quarter and the Clippers trailing 63-59. The Spurs
increased their margin to 75-65 over the next 5 1/2 minutes while the Clippers'
leading scorer was getting stitched up.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after Taylor returned, he banked in a 13-footer in between 3-point
shots by Piatkowski and Troy Hudson as the Clippers closed to 75-73. But
Robinson responded with a short hook shot, a dunk and a 14-foot jumper in the
final minute of the quarter for an 81-75 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson, who scored 71 points against the Clippers at the L.A. Sports Arena
in the 1993-94 season finale to clinch his first NBA scoring title, powered the
Spurs to a 58-52 halftime lead with 25 points on 12-for-17 shooting. It was the
highest total for one half by a Clippers opponent this season, two more than
Shaquille O'Neal had for the Lakers on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers led 33-27 after one quarter despite Robinson's 16 points and
five rebounds. San Antonio trailed by as many as seven before taking its first
lead, 40-39, on a 15-foot running jumper by Antonio Daniels with 6:41 left in
the half. Robinson's 17-footer less than 2 1/2 minutes later gave the Spurs a
44-43 lead they would not relinquish.

Experts To Continue Israel-Syria Talks

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Israel and Syria each will send a pair of experts to
Washington to try and whittle away at their differences on how to reach a
land-for-peace accord. But with full-scale negotiations suspended indefinitely,
the outlook is cloudy. All main issues remain in dispute -- borders, peace
terms, security, water -- and top Clinton administration officials are searching
for a formula to put the talks back on track. At the windup of a round of
negotiations last Monday in Shepherdstown, W.Va., a nine-day recess was set to

Confederate battle flag should no longer be allowed to fly above the South
Carolina Capitol. Vice President Gore and Bradley, a former senator, also stated
their support for affirmative action policies during the hourlong forum on

demand that President Clinton issue an executive order immediately ending the

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aiming to step up AIDS treatment and prevention programs,
President Clinton will ask Congress to increase federal spending against the
disease by $175 million in his 2001 budget. Administration officials said on
Monday that Clinton will request $125 million over this year's spending level
for Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Act grants and $50 million
additional for prevention efforts at the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. CDC prevention programs are to receive $695 million in 2000 and the
Ryan White grant program $1.6 billion this year, although budget cuts Clinton
agreed to with Congress last year could reduce those amounts.

continued flow of technology to Tehran, primarily from Russia. U.S. officials
reacted with alarm to reports over the weekend that Iran may order an additional
three nuclear reactors from Russia. Russian engineers are already building one

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- National security officials are increasingly worried that
Iran, with help from Russia, may be closer than previously believed to producing
nuclear weapons. Among the chief concerns, said administration officials, is the
continued flow of technology to Tehran, primarily from Russia. U.S. officials
reacted with alarm to reports over the weekend that Iran may order an additional
three nuclear reactors from Russia. Russian engineers are already building one
reactor at a site in southern Iran under an existing contract.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Russia has formally objected to Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's decision to appoint Rolf Ekeus of Sweden chief weapons inspector
for Iraq, throwing the nomination into doubt and marking an ominous start to a

Monday evening to the Security Council president informing him that Moscow
"cannot agree with the proposal," a U.S. official said, reading from the letter.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The boom on Wall Street is widening the income gap
between the poorest and richest U.S. families, according to a report by two
Washington think tanks. The earnings for the poorest fifth of American families
rose less than 1 percent between 1988 and 1998 but jumped 15 percent for the
richest fifth, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Economic
Policy Institute said in their report issued Tuesday. Income for the poorest
families -- defined as two or more relatives living together -- rose $110 to
$12,990 during the 10-year period.

<HEADLINE> Garth Brooks Wins 2 AMA Trophies  </HEADLINE>
    By BETH HARRIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The path to the podium at the American Music Awards is a
familiar one for Garth Brooks.
</P>
<P>
	   The top selling artist of the 1990s began the new decade by winning two AMA
trophies Monday, for best country male artist and country album for "Double
Live." He has raised the possibility of retiring at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not sure that people don't need a breather from Garth," he said after
also receiving a special honor as artist of the 1990s. "You look at your three
children, and really, that's your calling.
</P>
<P>
	   "Also, Sandy and my relationship deserves the time to be worked on," he said
of his marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   Veteran musicians like Brooks held their own Monday against a wave of young
up-and-comers, including the Backstreet Boys, the Dixie Chicks and Lauryn Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   The first honor of the night went to the sentimental favorite, 52-year-old
rock guitarist Carlos Santana, who received a standing ovation after accepting
the favorite pop-rock album award for "Supernatural."
</P>
<P>
	   After thanking his family, Santana brought his co-producer, Clive Davis,
onstage to share the honor. Davis has been in a high-stakes power struggle over
his future with the company that owns Arista Records.
</P>
<P>
	   Backstage, Santana said, "a lot of people told me they didn't want to work
with me because I'm old. Mr. Davis believed in me. We both believed we had a
masterpiece in our belly."
</P>
<P>
	   "Supernatural," which put Santana atop the charts for the first time in his
30-year career, beat out two teen sensations, the Backstreet Boys' "Millennium"
and Britney Spears' "... Baby One More Time."
</P>
<P>
	   Longtime collaborators Brooks &AMP; Dunn were named best country band, duo or
group, beating out Diamond Rio and the Dixie Chicks, who also lost out against
Brooks for best country album.
</P>
<P>
	   Shania Twain won for pop-rock female artist and country female artist. Hill
was honored as favorite soul-rhythm and blues female artist while "The
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" won for soul-R&AMP;B album.
</P>
<P>
	   Including the artist of the decade honor, Brooks has 16 trophies, tying him
with Lionel Richie for fourth place on the all-time list of American Music Award
winners.
</P>
<P>
	   DMX won for favorite rap-hip hop artist. On stage he thanked Jesus, but
backstage, he grumbled that with two hit albums out previously, he should have
already won an honor. "I feel I should have won a few awards," he said. "Give it
all to me."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitney Houston, who tied with Twain and Spears for most nominations with
three, was shut out and didn't attend. Awards spokesman Paul Shefrin said her
absence was unrelated to an incident in Hawaii last week, when airport security
guards said they found marijuana in her bag.
</P>
<P>
	   Tyrese took the honors for new soul-rhythm and blues artist.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm a living example of if you put your mind to it and let God do his work,
it'll work out for you," he said, dedicating his award to the gritty
neighborhood in the Watts section of Los Angeles where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
	   Nominees for the 27th annual awards were chosen by music industry
representatives. The winners were decided in voting by about 20,000 music fans
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   The show also featured results of an Internet poll that named Elvis Presley
favorite artist of the 1950s, the Beatles of the 1960s, Stevie Wonder of the
1970s and Michael Jackson of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariah Carey received an Award of Achievement for her "rare and
distinguished accomplishments." Michael Jackson and Prince are the only previous
winners of that honor.
</P>
<P>
	   An Award of Merit went to Gloria Estefan, who was honored with a musical
tribute featuring 'N Sync.

<HEADLINE> Canada TV Station Fires News Anchor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TORONTO (AP) -- A Canadian television network fired a news anchorwoman after
she made comments considered offensive to the disabled and ethnic minorities
without realizing she was on the air.
</P>
<P>
	   CTV News announced the dismissal of Avery Haines on Monday, after receiving
complaints from viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   Haines had been having difficulty reading a script during a CTV Newsnet
broadcast on Saturday. Apparently mocking her mistakes, she said: "I kind of
like the stuttering thing. It's like equal opportunity, right?"
</P>
<P>
	   "We've got a stuttering newscaster. We've got the black, we've got the
Asian, we've got the woman. I could be a lesbian, folk-dancing, black woman
stutterer."
</P>
<P>
	   She apologized twice on air during the day. Nevertheless, CTV News issued a
news release Monday announcing Haines had been fired.
</P>
<P>
	   "The nature of her comments did not leave CTV News with any alternative,"
said Henry Kowalski, the vice president of CTV News.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Curzon, vice president of corporate communications at CTV, said Haines
began working as an anchor for CTV Newsnet, a national all-news channel, two
months ago. He was unable to provide her age.
</P>
<P>
	   Advocacy groups said Monday that Haines' comments showed that bigotry
against minorities exists in Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   "I find it disturbing that Avery Haines' remarks are only attracting
attention because she was caught in the act," said Moy Tam, executive director
of the Canadian Race Relations Foundation. "Would CTV even consider apologizing
for her comments if she had made them off the air?"
</P>
<P>
	   Kowalski said Haines showed "considerable journalistic talent," and that CTV
regretted having to dismiss her.
</P>
<P>
	   "However, her remarks were disrespectful and unprofessional and cannot be
excused," he said.

<P>
	   "The Mighty King of Love" (Shanachie) -- Phil Lee
</P>
<P>
	   The debut album by 49-year-old former long-haul trucker Phil Lee has one of
the best album names ever, but the superlatives should not stop there. "The
Mighty King of Love" rocks with a deep, rootsy twang. It's music for working up
a sweat in a crowded roadhouse on a rural highway, the sort of place where no
one asks, "Are these guys country or what?" as long as the band plays loud and
hard, and the longnecks are cold.
</P>
<P>
	   But there's more, which is what takes "The Mighty King of Love" all the way
to greatness. Lee does more than rock. He thinks, and his lyrics reflect the
process. The title song is not a boast, but an admission of failure and
self-doubt. "Someone Oughta Do Something About That Guy" reveals, in tidbits,
that the singer hasn't always been perfect either even as he criticizes a jerk.
Better still, the singer might not even recognize how similar his behavior has
been at times.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Mighty King of Love" is simply great, the sort of album that will take
up residence in your CD player and refuses to leave.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   "The Hurting Business" (Hightone) -- Chuck Prophet
</P>
<P>
	   Let's say Bob Dylan and Keith Richards went out drinking and found Tom Waits
and Johnny Cash at the bar, then they all went over to Paul Westerberg's house
where he was jamming in the basement with some cheesy '60s band like the
Turtles, and you happened to be there sitting on the sofa. The guy you never saw
before swaggering up to the microphone like he owned it would be Chuck Prophet.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Hurting Business" mixes roller-rink organ, ferocious guitar riffs,
mellotron and scratchy turntables as Prophet sings of pain and rising again in a
voice that is thoroughly convincing and a bit haunting. And where Beck, for
example, also mixes every strand of pop music into a blender, Prophet does not
traffic in irony the way Beck does. Whether singing about a broken relationship
or a woman whose son has died, he nails every emotion straight on, and is not
afraid to look them in the eye. A great album.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed on Interest Rate Worry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened mixed today as worries about rising interest
rates competed for investors' attention against some strong fourth-quarter
corporate earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 61.74 at 11,661.24. The Nasdaq composite index was up 8.55 at
4,072.82.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 8.46 at 1,456.69
</P>
<P>
	   Several Fortune 500 companies today reported stronger than expected
fourth-quarter earnings, including pharmaceutical firm Pfizer and financial
services companies Citigroup and PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer was off 9/16 at 36 9/16, while Citigroup was up 9/16 at 58 9/16 and
PaineWebber rose 5/16 to 38 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   But many investors were distracted by concerns about interest rates. The
yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond was up to 6.73 percent today from late
Friday's 6.69 percent, reaching levels not seen since July 1997. The financial
markets were closed Monday for the holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts expect the Federal Reserve to boost interest rates a quarter point
when it meets Feb. 1-2. The Fed's three rate hikes last year did little to slow
the economy, and the central bank is expected to raise rates again this year to
prevent inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 142.5 million shares, down from Friday's
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index was off 0.80 at 506.76.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.2 percent. In afternoon
trading, Germany's DAX index was down 2 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down
2.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 2.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Court OKs Good Fri. School Closings  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Maryland law that requires the annual closing of all
public schools from Good Friday to the Monday after Easter survived a Supreme
Court challenge today.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal in which retired teacher
Judith Koenick said the law violates the constitutionally required separation of
church and state.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirteen states designate Good Friday as a legal holiday but only three --
Maryland, Illinois and North Dakota -- require all public schools to close on
Good Friday. A federal appeals court has struck down the Illinois law.
</P>
<P>
	   A challenge to Indiana's Good Friday law is pending before the justices, who
have not yet said whether they will fully review that dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   In other cases acted upon today, the court:
</P>
<P>
	   --Rejected appeals by Quakers who say the Internal Revenue Service violates
their religious freedom by charging fees and interest for delays in paying the
portion of their federal tax that funds the military. The justices, turning away
arguments by three Religious Society of Friends members from New England and
Pennsylvania, let the tax agency impose the late fees and interest in addition
to the back taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   --Refused to hear an appeal from a former Indianapolis policeman who says he
had a right to carry a gun even after pleading guilty to a domestic-violence
crime. The court rejected Gerald Gillespie's constitutional challenge to a 1996
federal law that took away his gun and cost him his job. Today's action marks
the second time in the past three months the nation's highest court has let
Congress continue banning anyone -- including police officers -- from possessing
a gun after a domestic-violence conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   --Turned away a challenge to the fees charged for registering and annually
renewing Internet domain names. The justices, without comment, turned away
arguments that the fees are exorbitant and that a former practice of designating
a portion of the fees for a federal agency's use amounted to an illegal tax.
</P>
<P>
	   --Refused to hear an appeal from Vincent ``Chin'' Gigante, the imprisoned
``Oddfather'' who led the nation's No. 1 crime family while his bizarre behavior
fended off a criminal trial for seven years. The justices let stand Gigante's
1997 conviction for racketeering and murder conspiracy, and the 12-year prison
sentence it drew.
</P>
<P>
	   The Maryland Good Friday law ``sends the message to non-Christians that the
state finds Good Friday, and thus Christianity, to be a religion worth honoring
while their religion or nonreligion is not of equal importance,'' Ms. Koenick's
appeal said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That message is particularly significant in this case because it is being
sent to schoolchildren,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal trial judge and the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected
that argument. '' The four-day holiday around Easter is supported by a
pragmatic, legitimate secular purpose,'' the appeals court ruled last August.
</P>
<P>
	   That purpose, it said, is to avoid the anticipated high absenteeism among
teachers and students on the days surrounding Easter, the holiest of Christian
holidays.
</P>
<P>
	   While still a teacher, Ms. Koenick sued the Montgomery County, Md., Board of
Education in 1996 as a taxpayer. Ms. Koenick, who is Jewish, said the law
``sends a message of inclusion to Christian children and a message of exclusion
to their Jewish, Muslim and nonbelieving classmates.''
</P>
<P>
	   Montgomery County schools also are closed on Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of
Atonement, and the first day of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year. But those
policy decisions are based on findings that large numbers of students would be
absent if schools were open on those days.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryland law does not require school closings for any Jewish holiday. A
state law designates these public school holidays: Thanksgiving and the day
after; Christmas Eve through Jan. 1; the Friday before Easter through the Monday
after; Memorial Day; and primary and general election days.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices were told that state and federal courts are divided over the
legitimacy of laws or governmental practices dealing with Good Friday, which
commemorates the crucifixion of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Ms. Koenick urged the court ``to bring order to the lower
courts' chaotic decisions concerning governmental recognition of Good Friday.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the county school board's lawyers urged the court to reject her appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Noting that the four-day Easter break dates back to 1865, they said it ``is
no different than the four-day Thanksgiving and nine-day Christmas breaks.''
</P>
<P>
	   The holiday ``is anchored around the increasingly secularized holiday of
Easter, which is a traditional time for Marylanders, like many other Americans,
to begin Easter-related travel,'' the school board's lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 13 states listed as having Good Friday laws are Delaware, Florida,
Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina,
North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
	   California and Kentucky have laws establishing part of Good Friday as a
holiday for government employees, and in Texas the day is an ``optional
holiday'' for state employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Koenick vs. Felton, 99-816.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Allowed To Segregate AIDS Cons  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today let a few states continue, at
least for now, segregating inmates who have the AIDS virus from most activities
available to their general prison populations.
</P>
<P>
	   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal in which Alabama inmates with
the Human Immunodeficiency Virus argued that the state's policy violates federal
laws banning discrimination against the disabled.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices were told that only Mississippi and South Carolina similarly
require such extensive segregation of HIV-positive inmates.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's action does not set a legal precedent and does not preclude the
possibility the nation's highest court someday may review such a state policy.
The denial of review leaves intact a federal appeals court ruling that said
Alabama's policy does not run afoul of the federal anti-bias laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers representing inmate Arion Davis and all other HIV-positive Alabama
prisoners sued the state 14 years ago over its policy of barring them from
participating in various educational, vocational, recreational and religious
activities along with non-infected inmates.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit said the policy violated the federal Rehabilitation Act. Since
then, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 also became law.
</P>
<P>
	   After a 1994 trial, a federal judge ruled that HIV-positive inmates were not
protected by the federal laws because they were not ``otherwise qualified'' to
participate in such programs.
</P>
<P>
	   That ruling was upheld by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year.
The Atlanta-based appeals court, voting 9-3 against the inmates, said the policy
was valid because HIV-positive inmates pose a ``significant risk'' to others.
</P>
<P>
	   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the Alabama inmates said the lower
courts wrongly based such a risk on the ``possibility'' of someone transmitting
the virus. Those courts failed to consider the ``probability'' of that
occurring, the appeal said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama's lawyers urged the justices to reject the appeal. The federal laws'
definition of people with disabilities ``does not include an individual who has
a currently contagious disease or infection and who ... would constitute a
direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked by the court for its views, the Clinton administration said the appeal
should be denied.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Justice Department lawyers said the appeals court may have erred in
not more closely examining the risks involved in HIV-positive inmates'
participation in specific programs, they said its ruling ``does not conflict
with any decision of any other court of appeals and does not warrant full
review.''
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Davis vs. Hopper, 98-9663.

<HEADLINE> Liddy Can Be Sued for Defamation  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- G. Gordon Liddy failed today in his Supreme Court bid to
fend off a defamation lawsuit by a woman he linked to an alleged call-girl ring
at the Democratic National Committee at the time of the 1972 Watergate break-in.
</P>
<P>
	   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal in which Liddy argued that
the woman should be considered a public figure who would have to prove ``actual
malice'' to win her lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Liddy arranged the June 17, 1972, burglary of Democratic Party headquarters
at the Watergate office building that led to President Nixon's 1974 resignation.
He served four years and four months in prison and now is a radio talk-show
host.
</P>
<P>
	   Liddy is among those who say the purpose of the break-in was not to repair a
telephone tap installed earlier but to gather information on an alleged
call-girl ring at the Democratic headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   During public speeches, Liddy has said that DNC secretary Ida M. Wells' desk
held photographs of prostitutes that were shown to visiting men.
</P>
<P>
	   Wells filed a $5 million lawsuit against Liddy in 1997, contending he
defamed her by suggesting she procured prostitutes for DNC visitors.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge in Maryland ruled for Liddy. The judge said Wells must be
considered an involuntary public figure who would have to prove that Liddy spoke
with actual malice -- knowledge his statements were false or reckless disregard
of whether they were true.
</P>
<P>
	   But the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated Wells' lawsuit, saying
she was a private figure and need not meet that high standard of proof.
</P>
<P>
	   Private citizens need only prove that a statement was defamatory, false and
made negligently.
</P>
<P>
	   An involuntary public figure is someone who tried to stay out of public
discussion of an important controversy but nevertheless was a central character
in that event, the appeals court said. Wells was only ``a very minor figure'' in
Watergate, it added.
</P>
<P>
	   In the appeal acted on today, Liddy's lawyers said the 4th Circuit court's
ruling will chill discussion of public events by making it easier for some
people to sue.
</P>
<P>
	   Wells' lawyers urged the justices to reject Liddy's appeal. They said she
played no role in Watergate aside from being ``an innocent victim of (Liddy's)
criminal activity.''
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Liddy vs. Wells, 99-870.

<HEADLINE> Court Orders Restudy of Equal Pay  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a surprising move, the Supreme Court today ordered
lower courts to restudy rulings that said states and their agencies must abide
by a 1963 federal law requiring employers to give men and women equal pay for
equal work.
</P>
<P>
	   The court, issuing brief orders in cases from Illinois and New York, said
those rulings should be reconsidered in light of its decision last week that
said state employees are not protected by a federal law banning age bias.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's orders are surprising because last week's decision emphasized that
age bias is not subject to the same level of judicial scrutiny as race and
gender bias.
</P>
<P>
	   In one of the cases acted on today, Illinois State University officials seek
to get out from under a 1995 class-action lawsuit that accuses the school in
Normal, Ill., of paying its female professors less than their male colleagues.
</P>
<P>
	   School officials contend the federal Equal Pay Act, when applied to state
employees, violates states' 11th Amendment immunity from being sued in federal
courts.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit, filed by professors Iris Varner, Teresa Palmer and Paula
Pomerenke, also accused Illinois State of violating a federal anti-bias law
known as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. That law, and that part of
the lawsuit, was not at issue in the appeal acted on today.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal trial judge and the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the
university's contention that it could not be sued under the Equal Pay Act. The
school's lawyers argued that Congress lacked the authority, and never intended,
to make the law nullify states' 11th Amendment immunity.
</P>
<P>
	   The university officials contend that state employees invoking the federal
law must sue in state courts.
</P>
<P>
	   In the second case, officials at the State University of New York at New
Paltz are trying to escape an Equal Pay Act lawsuit by Dr. Janice W. Anderson, a
tenured associate professor in the school's communications and media department.
</P>
<P>
	   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the school and said
Anderson could invoke the federal law because Congress had wiped out New York's
11th Amendment immunity in such cases.
</P>
<P>
	   The cases are Illinois State University vs. Varner, 98-1117, and State
University of New York at New Paltz vs. Anderson, 98-1845.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as worries about rising interest
rates competed for investors' attention against some strong fourth-quarter
corporate earnings reports. Profit-taking following last week's rally also
contributed to some selling.
</P>
<P>
	   At midmorning on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down

	   Pfizer was off 1 at 36 1/8, while Citigroup was down  1/2 at 58 and
PaineWebber rose  7/8 to 38 13/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Leading the Dow lower was General Electric, down 4 to 147 1/4 and American

</P>
<P>
	   The Dow rose 200 points on Friday for its first finish about 11,700.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a pause to refresh, and I would use it as a buying opportunity,"
said Al Goldman, director of market analysis, A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Many investors were distracted by concerns about interest rates. The yield
on the Treasury's 30-year bond was up to 6.74 percent today from late Friday's
6.69 percent, reaching levels not seen since July 1997. The financial markets
were closed Monday for the holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts expect the Federal Reserve to boost interest rates a quarter point
when it meets Feb. 1-2. The Fed's three rate hikes last year did little to slow
the economy, and the central bank is expected to raise rates again this year to
prevent inflation from accelerating.
</P>

Stock Exchange, where volume came to 322.5 million shares, up from Friday's

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Appeal by Psychics  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to revive a lawsuit in
which 16 former employees of a California psychic hotline accused ABC television
of unlawfully using a hidden camera to videotape them at work.
</P>
<P>
	   The court, without comment, turned away the former employees' argument that
they should be allowed to sue ABC under a federal eavesdropping law.
</P>
<P>
	   The secret recordings were used by ABC's ``Prime Time Live'' program for a
1993 expose on whether employees at the hotline believed in the service. An ABC
reporter had gotten a job at the Psychic Marketing Group, which advertised
telephone psychic advice for $3.95 a minute.
</P>
<P>
	   The employees sued ABC under a federal eavesdropping law that lets people
tape conversations in which they are a party, unless the taping is intended to
help commit a crime or damage another person.
</P>
<P>
	   Five of those who sued were shown in the broadcast, while the rest were
videotaped but did not appear in the program.
</P>
<P>
	   The former employees also accused ABC of fraud, defamation and invasion of
privacy under California law. Those claims were dismissed because they were
added after the deadline to sue.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge ruled for ABC on the eavesdropping claim, concluding that
recording a conversation for news-gathering purposes would not violate the
wiretapping law.
</P>
<P>
	   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling. Journalists do not
get a blanket exemption, the appeals court said, but taping for news-gathering
purposes do not violate the law so long as there was no accompanying unlawful
goal.
</P>
<P>
	   In the appeal acted on today, the former employees said ABC committed a
number of offenses under California law, such as fraud and invasion of privacy.
The network therefore could be held liable under the eavesdropping law, the
appeal said.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC's lawyers said state law provided a remedy for the type of damage
claimed by the employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month a California appeals court upheld a $635,000 verdict against ABC
in an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit by two other employees of the hotline.
</P>
<P>
	   The case acted on today is Sussman vs. American Broadcasting Company,
99-840.

<HEADLINE> Alan Alda on Quest for Longevity  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Alan Alda's lunch is under scrutiny by Dr. Roy Walford,
an expert in diet and longevity, and the verdict isn't good.
</P>
<P>
	   The turkey sandwich (hold the mayo), pretzels and pickles are high in
cholesterol and sodium and low in nearly every nutrient, Walford tells Alda in
"Never Say Die," an episode of PBS' "Scientific American Frontiers."
</P>
<P>
	   "Your heart would sink if I took out the frozen yogurt," Alda says. "No,
yours would," Walford shoots back in the program, airing 8 p.m. EST Tuesday,
Jan. 25 (check local listings).
</P>
<P>
	   The good doctor doesn't leave Alda or us without hope: Walford contends we
can live longer, healthier lives simply by eating less and better, making sure
every bite is rich in vitamins and minerals. Walford, now 75, figures to make it
to 110.
</P>
<P>
	   His research and the work of other scientists prying into the aging process
are detailed in the hourlong special, with Alda serving as an enthusiastic and
inquisitive tour guide.
</P>
<P>
	   "What if I told you that you wouldn't have to check in here until you were
150 years old, 200, 250?" the actor asks as he strolls through a cemetery.
"Right now, a lot of serious, smart scientists are beginning to say that's
what's possible."
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the work in progress at universities and research firms sounds
almost more science fiction than fact.
</P>
<P>
	   In experiments, mice being fed the kind of calorie-restricted diet advocated
by Walford are friskier and younger-looking than their gluttonous counterparts,
an indication the aging process has slowed.
</P>
<P>
	   We learn about telomeres, protective tips at the end of chromosomes that are
likened to the plastic sleeves covering shoelace ends. When telomeres wear out,
cells become vulnerable and the stage is set for diseases of aging, including
cataracts and arthritis.
</P>
<P>
	   At Geron Corp., a California biotech company, scientists are experimenting
with a gene that restores telomeres, using what Alda colorfully describes as a
"Frankenstein-like shock" to force new material into old cells.
</P>
<P>
	   Nematodes are the focus of Cynthia Kenyon, a University of California
researcher who has doubled the two-week life span of some of the microscopic
worms with genetic tampering.
</P>
<P>
	   If such research ultimately can be applied to humans, however, does it
necessarily follow that everyone would want to take advantage?
</P>
<P>
	   "Some people are encouraged by the notion of living a long time, and some
people are scared," Alda said in an interview. "I see real emotion when people
say, 'I don't want to live that long.' They don't know that scientists are
talking about living in a healthy state.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think people are so accustomed to seeing frailty in old age, that's not a
concept that comes easily."
</P>
<P>
	   The potential of a 150-year life span is tempting to Alda, 63. His resume so
far includes films, the hit series "M-A-S-H," a recent acclaimed turn as an
Alzheimer's-stricken doctor on "ER" and seven years as host of "Scientific
American Frontiers."
</P>
<P>
	   "I think there's an opportunity and almost an obligation that time forces on
you, an obligation to learn to do a whole new thing probably two or three times
in your life. That'll be very interesting to see people start whole new
careers," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked how he would spend his bonus years, Alda briefly mulls the question.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've been trying to teach myself Chinese for 10 or 15 years and I haven't
gotten very far with it," he said. "If I knew I had an extra 100 years, maybe
I'd go live for a few years in China."
</P>
<P>
	   For now, Alda devotes time to his seven grandchildren and his "Frontiers"
adventures. Despite memories of suffering glass pipette cuts in lab class ("I
should have come in when they were using plastic"), he is a fan of science and
its practitioners.
</P>
<P>
	   "One of the nice things about the show for me never shows up on camera.
That's spending the whole day with the scientists, talking with them and seeing
how their brains work," Alda said.
</P>
<P>
	   He recalled an interview with one scientist who was tucked away under a
mountain in Italy with a huge device built to capture neutrinos from space.
</P>
<P>
	   "I asked him a question at 8 in the morning and at 2 o'clock he hadn't
finished the sentence yet. It was just a stream of wonderful information -- some
of which I understood."
</P>
<P>
	   Alda enjoys helping turn such complexity into simplicity.
</P>
<P>
	   "We get scientists to just try to explain it to me, and not to the camera,
to keep them from going into a lecture mode. It's very colloquial and very
personal; they're just trying to get me to understand it."

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Challenge EU Aircraft Rules  </HEADLINE>
   By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is putting the European Union
on notice that it intends to challenge regulations that would prohibit aircraft
with engine mufflers known as ``hush kits'' from European skies. Administration
officials contend the rules discriminate against U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
	   David Aaron, the Commerce Department's undersecretary for international
affairs, told reporters Tuesday the administration plans to file a complaint
with the International Civil Aviation Organization in Montreal in the ``next
several weeks.'' The complaint will seek the repeal of the EU's regulations,
which have been adopted but are not slated to take effect until May 4.
</P>
<P>
	   Ella Krucoff, an EU spokeswoman here, said the regulations -- which have
already been postponed once -- are not discriminatory. The EU won't postpone
them again if the United States files the complaint, Krucoff said. ``We would
regard this as a very unhelpful step,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aaron said he planned to fly to Montreal on Tuesday to present the
administration's case to the international aviation organization, which sets
standards for flights around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States wants the group ``to rule that hush kit regulations are
inconsistent and incompatible with ICAO rules'' and order the regulations be
withdrawn, Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some U.S. airlines have fitted their aging jets with hush kits to muffle
their existing engines in order to comply with a new federal noise standard that
took effect in the United States on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   EU officials have said that while reducing noise pollution, the kits are
ineffective at controlling pollution. As a practical matter, the regulations'
biggest impact would be on American airlines and equipment suppliers.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU's regulations could have a $2 billion effect on the United States,
Aaron said. It would devalue airplanes in the U.S. fleet, often resold in
Europe, and harm hush-kit makers, all of whom are American companies.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Allowed To Segregate AIDS Cons  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several states may continue segregating inmates who have
the AIDS virus from their general prison populations, at least for now, because
the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to Alabama's policy Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The court, acting without comment, turned away arguments by Alabama inmates
with the human immunodeficiency virus that the state is violating federal laws
banning discrimination against the disabled.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices were told that only Mississippi and South Carolina similarly
require such extensive segregation of HIV-positive inmates.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's action did not set a legal precedent and did not preclude the
possibility the nation's highest court someday may review such a state policy.
But it left intact a federal appeals court ruling that said Alabama's policy
does not run afoul of federal anti-bias laws, including the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's unsettling that no one with the power to influence Alabama's prison
policy -- including the Alabama Legislature and all branches of the federal
government -- is willing to address this total undermining of the ADA's language
and intent,'' said Catherine Hanssens of the Lamda Legal Defense and Education
Fund, a gay-rights advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers representing inmate Arion Davis and all other HIV-positive Alabama
prisoners sued the state 14 years ago over its policy of barring them from
living with non-infected inmates or from participating in various educational,
vocational, recreational and religious activities with them.
</P>
<P>
	   After a 1994 trial, a federal judge ruled that HIV-positive inmates were not
protected by the federal laws because they were not ``otherwise qualified'' to
participate in such programs.
</P>
<P>
	   That ruling was upheld by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year.
The Atlanta-based appeals court, voting 9-3 against the inmates, said the policy
was valid because HIV-positive inmates pose a ``significant risk'' to others.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked by the court for its views, the Clinton administration said the appeal
should be denied.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Justice Department lawyers said the appeals court may have erred in
not more closely examining the risks involved in HIV-positive inmates'
participation in specific programs, they said its ruling ``does not conflict
with any decision of any other court of appeals and does not warrant full
review.''

services companies Citigroup and PaineWebber.

Uniphase and E-Tek Dynamics, two companies that make components used in optical

were closed Monday for the holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts expect the Federal Reserve to boost interest rates a quarter

again this year to prevent inflation from accelerating.

<HEADLINE> Court OKs Good Fri. School Closings  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court is letting Maryland require public
schools to close on Good Friday, but the legitimacy of that law and Good Friday
laws in more than a dozen states remains clouded.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices, acting without comment Tuesday, rejected an appeal in which a
retired Maryland teacher said the school-closings law violates constitutionally
required separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
	   In separate action, the nation's highest court turned away appeals by
Quakers who say the Internal Revenue Service violates their religious freedom by
charging fees and interest for delays in paying the portion of their federal tax
that funds the military.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the states with Good Friday laws, only Maryland, Illinois and South
Dakota require all public schools to close on that day each year. A federal
appeals court struck down the Illinois law.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices still have before them a challenge to an Indiana law
designating Good Friday a state holiday. They have not yet said whether they
will grant full review to that dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not going away,'' said Dwight Sullivan, an American Civil
Liberties Union lawyer in Baltimore. ``You have the Constitution being applied
differently in different states.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Maryland law ``sends the message to non-Christians that the state finds
Good Friday, and thus Christianity, to be a religion worth honoring while their
religion or nonreligion is not of equal importance,'' contended an appeal by
former teacher Judith Koenick.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That message is particularly significant in this case because it is being
sent to schoolchildren,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lower courts rejected her argument. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
said the long weekend's legitimate purpose is to avoid anticipated high
absenteeism among teachers and students on the days surrounding Easter, the
holiest of Christian holidays.
</P>
<P>
	   Good Friday, always two days before Easter Sunday, commemorates the
crucifixion of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
	   Montgomery County schools also are closed on Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of
Atonement, and the first day of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year. Those policy
decisions are based not on anticipated absenteeism but on findings that large
numbers of students would be absent if schools were open on those days.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryland law does not require school closings for any Jewish holiday. State
law designates these public school holidays: Thanksgiving and the day after;
Christmas Eve through Jan. 1; the Friday before Easter through the Monday after;
Memorial Day; and primary and general election days.
</P>
<P>
	   State and federal courts are divided, the justices were told, over the
constitutionality of laws or governmental practices that deal with Good Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Ms. Koenick urged the court ``to bring order to the lower
courts' chaotic decisions concerning governmental recognition of Good Friday.''
</P>
<P>
	   But lawyers for the Montgomery County Board of Education said the four-day
holiday ``is anchored around the increasingly secularized holiday of Easter,
which is a traditional time for Marylanders, like many other Americans, to begin
Easter-related travel.''
</P>
<P>
	   The justices were told that 13 states have Good Friday laws: Delaware,
Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, North
Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
	   California and Kentucky have laws establishing part of Good Friday as a
holiday for government employees, and in Texas the day is an ``optional
holiday'' for state employees.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Quakers' case, the court turned away arguments by three Religious
Society of Friends members from New England and Pennsylvania. The action let the
IRS continue charging late fees and interest in addition to their back taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals filed on behalf of Gordon and Edith Browne, who have homes in
New Hampshire and Vermont, and Priscilla Lippincott Adams of Philadelphia did
not contest having to pay 100 percent of their tax bill when the tax agency
forces their hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the Quakers cited a ``religious hardship'' and argued that they
should be able to pay the back taxes without any penalties or interest.
</P>
<P>
	   They said that as a result of religious faith and study, they cannot
voluntarily pay that portion of their federal income taxes which they determine
are dedicated to war and war-related activities.
</P>
<P>
	   In rejecting those arguments, lower courts relied on a 1982 Supreme Court
decision that said, ``The tax system could not function if denominations were
allowed to challenge (it) because tax payments were spent in a manner that
violates their religious belief.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Turns Attention to 4 Countries  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the Clinton administration heads into its final year,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright singled out four countries -- Colombia,
Nigeria, Indonesia and Ukraine -- for special attention and U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Each can be a major force for stability and progress in its region, and
each is at a critical point along the democratic path,'' Albright said in a
speech on democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright did not say how much assistance the administration planned for the
four countries beyond $1.6 billion for Colombia that she announced on her trip
to the South American country last weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The struggle in Colombia is not between right and left, rich and poor, or
between one ethnic group and another,'' she said. ``It is between those who want
to pursue prosperity and social development democratically and those addicted to
criminality, violence and corruption.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nigeria, she said, has had its U.S. aid nearly quadrupled under President
Clinton in an effort to help Nigerians deal with threats to stability and
democracy. The African country is faced with a high-stakes test of democracy,
Albright said, and ``we must do all we can to help them succeed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indonesia's President Abdurrahman Wahid deserves support as he tries to
stabilize the economy, deepen civilian control of the military, establish the
rule of law, maintain national unity and respect human rights, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   She called Ukraine a partner and friend of the United States threatened with
economic decline, corruption and crime. ``We will continue to help our partner
move down the path to deeper reform, fuller freedom and sustained growth,'' she
said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Object to Gene Patent  </HEADLINE>
    By EMMA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- British scientists who did much of the research that led to
the discovery of a gene involved in breast cancer objected Tuesday to a U.S.
company's attempt to obtain European patents for the gene.
</P>
<P>
	   Sir Walter Bodmer, a geneticist with the Imperial Cancer Research Fund
involved in early research on the gene, called on the British government to
challenge the patent application, saying Myriad Genetics Inc.'s claim to the
BRCA2 gene is dubious.
</P>
<P>
	   Myriad, a Utah-based gene discovery company, holds U.S. patents for the
gene, as well as for another breast cancer gene known as BRCA1, which works in
tandem with BRCA2. There is no dispute about Myriad's claim of discovery to
BRCA1.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has applied for a patent for both genes in Britain and other
European countries, where it wants to provide genetic testing services. Testing
for mutations of these genes has been shown to be a strong indicator of a
woman's predisposition for breast and ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrew Read, chairman of the British Society of Human Genetics, said a real
question exists as to whether the gene was discovered by Myriad or the
London-based Institute of Cancer Research.
</P>
<P>
	   "The whole area of gene patenting is controversial because it gives the
prize to the person who put the last brick in the wall," said Read, adding that
scientists at the British institute had identified the gene, but that Myriad
beat them to the U.S. patent office in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   "Evidence accumulates," Read said. "In this case, there was no inventive
step. Any Ph.D. student could write down how to do it."
</P>
<P>
	   While the contribution of other researchers who worked on the gene cannot be
minimized, "it's generally the case that the group that wins the race has the
patent. That's just the way it works," said William Hockett, director of
corporate communications for Myriad. "We claim to have discovered the sequence
of the gene."
</P>
<P>
	   Britain's Department of Health said it would not be able to challenge Myriad
until after a patent had been granted. Some companies patent genes in order to
develop commercial health products.
</P>
<P>
	   British scientists also are worried the company could control access to
genetic testing at a price Myriad dictates. But Hockett said that tests should
not cost any more or be harder to come by because of the patent.
</P>
<P>
	   Bodmer, who is also head of Oxford University's Hertford College, said
Myriad is claiming it contributed far more than it actually achieved. As result,
he said, "there is a lot of feeling of unfairness" among British
scientists.

<HEADLINE> Arab-Americans Criticize Survey  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL SHEPARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Arab-American group is criticizing a Transportation
Department plan to ask airline passengers about their ethnicity and religion --
an effort intended to test the level of discrimination felt by fliers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When we start down the road of asking people to provide this kind of
information, where does it take us?'' asked James Zogby, president of the Arab
American Institute, a Washington-based Arab-American interest group.
</P>
<P>
	   The department intends to gather the ethnic and religious background and
citizenship information to help it determine if passengers feel they were
singled out for scrutiny by security officials for no good reason.
</P>
<P>
	   In light of the concerns voiced by the Arab American Institute, department
spokesman Bill Mosley said Tuesday that no final decision has been reached on
whether the surveys will be distributed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We just want to ensure that no discrimination occurs,'' Mosley said.
</P>
<P>
	   The surveys, to begin in April at airports in Detroit, would be given to all
passengers on selected flights to gather information on which passengers felt
harassed.
</P>
<P>
	   Zogby said transportation officials asked his group to help inform the
Arab-American community about the surveys and help promote them. But Zogby said
his group couldn't support asking people intimate questions about their religion
or ethnicity because some in his community would feel they were being picked on
or would question what would be done with the information.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You mean they want to just start asking people their names and religion
and ethnicity. I told them people are going to freak,'' Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
	   Zogby said the method of airport security now in use called the
Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System has produced fewer complaints of
discrimination in his community than the earlier selection system.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the computer-based system, passengers are selected for luggage
searches or more extensive X-ray scans of carry-on baggage under a secret
criteria that does not include information on race or religion.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the computers were used, airline officials, again using secret
criteria, determined who would be pulled out of line for more extensive
searches. Zogby said people who appeared to be Arab were pulled out of line at
disproportionately high rates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've proposed they hold some focus groups to see how people feel about
being asked those questions,'' Zogby said. ``But the new system seems to be
working better. I don't see why they have to start asking people all these
questions.''

<HEADLINE> Internet-Names Challenge Rejected  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A challenge to the fees charged for registering and
annually renewing Internet domain names was rejected Tuesday by the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Without comment, the court turned away arguments that the fees are
exorbitant and that a former practice of designating a portion of the fees for a
federal agency's use amounted to an illegal tax.
</P>
<P>
	   The court's action set no legal precedent, but it nonetheless was a victory
for the National Science Foundation and Network Solutions Inc., the Herndon,
Va.-based company that serves as keeper of the master list of World Wide Web
addresses.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Science Foundation, an independent federal agency, provides
federal financial support for scientific research and science education
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Under an agreement with the agency, Network Solutions has registered on a
first-come, first-served basis more than 5 million addresses since 1992 for the
top-level domains -- those with ``com,'' ``org'' and ``net'' suffixes.
</P>
<P>
	   Internet domain names can be worth plenty. For example, a Houston
businessman recently sold the domain name business.com for $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Beginning in 1995, Network Solutions charged a registration fee of $100 and,
after an initial two-year period, a $50 annual renewal fee for each domain name.
</P>
<P>
	   Network Solutions received 70 percent of all fees for its services; the
other 30 percent was designated for the National Science Foundation's use for
Internet development and research. The 30 percent portion was discontinued in
1998, and the respective fees now are $70 and $35.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of Web site owners sued in 1997. Their federal lawsuit, seeking
millions of dollars in refunds, said the National Science Foundation's take was
an illegal tax unauthorized by Congress and that the fees collected by Network
Solutions far exceeded the nominal costs it incurred as keeper of the domain
names registry.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge initially said the 30 percent portion was an illegal tax,
but Congress in 1998 passed a law explicitly authorizing that portion. The judge
subsequently threw out the lawsuit, and a federal appeals court upheld the
dismissal last May.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeal acted on Tuesday argued, among other things, that Congress cannot
retroactively authorize a tax that was illegal when first imposed.

<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- Vanessa Redgrave will take on one of her most intriguing
roles yet -- playing the decidedly male magician-ruler Prospero in "The Tempest"
at Shakespeare's Globe this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   "I do want to find things for great actors, and Vanessa's a great actor,
male or female," Mark Rylance, artistic director of the Globe, said Tuesday in
announcing the restored Elizabethan playhouse's summer lineup.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Redgrave, 62, on "vocal rest" because of a virus, was unable to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Rylance said casting Ms. Redgrave as the exiled magician, one of the Bard's
most melancholy parts, made sense.
</P>
<P>
	   "Vanessa has always had a very passionate interest in people in exile and
has often encountered people who are in that very situation that Prospero is
in," Rylance said. "I think she'll bring her experience of the world's troubles
to the part."

</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces New Gun Program  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- In a city that drove its homicide rate down by emphasizing
community policing and aggressive enforcement of firearms laws, President
Clinton today called for $280 million worth of new steps to combat gun violence.
</P>
<P>
	   The president said his package of proposals was designed to send an
unambiguous message to criminals: ``If you commit crimes with guns or violate
gun laws, you will pay a heavy price.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton spoke to a group of lawmakers, law enforcement officers and
community leaders at the Orchard Gardens Community Center in Boston's Roxbury
section, an area notorious for drug-related violence that officials said has
directly benefited from efforts to get illegal guns off the streets.
</P>
<P>
	   The new measures Clinton seeks -- 500 new Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms agents and inspectors and creation of a program to track guns through
ballistics testing -- represents a subtle shift in administration strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   After a spate of high-profile shooting attacks by troubled killers at high
schools and community centers, Clinton pushed for tougher gun-control measures
in Congress. But legislation has stalled over such issues as how to extend Brady
Law background checks to gun shows or whether to require safety locks on
handguns.
</P>
<P>
	   Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association, which had accused Clinton
of seeking new gun controls instead of strictly enforcing existing firearms
laws, questioned the administration's sincerity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While I applaud what they're doing -- they seem to be embracing it -- I
want to look real hard at this to see that they have had a change of heart and
want to make this a way of life,'' LaPierre told ABC.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration already has announced a request for $10 million to
develop ``smart guns'' that fire only when held by their owners. A similar
request died in Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The new plans for the budget for fiscal year 2001, which begins Oct. 1,
represent an effort to invest more in enforcement of existing laws on the
illegal use and possession of firearms, a priority for Republicans and groups
such as the NRA.
</P>
<P>
	   The president urged Congress to move beyond the debate between enforcement
and preventive measures and to quickly pass ``commonsense'' gun legislation
instituting background checks at gun shows, mandating child safety locks and
banning the import of large ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have always been convinced that we have to have the proper balance of
punishment and prevention,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   As for enforcement steps, Clinton said he would ask Congress to hire the new
ATF agents and inspectors and 1,000 more federal, state and local prosecutors to
focus on gun-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   He also will seek to expand an existing gun-tracing program from 38 to 51
cities and ask for $30 million to create a ballistics information network to
track ballistics data of guns used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   By maintaining records of unique markings each gun barrel leaves on bullets,
investigators could track firearms used in crimes to their purchasers, even if
that person had passed the weapon to another individual.
</P>
<P>
	   Boston's homicide rate dropped to a 38-year low in 1999, thanks in part to a
program that allied law enforcement, the clergy, community leaders and gang
members against crime.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston Pilot Project is credited with the homicide toll dropping from
153 slayings in 1990 to 31 in 1999. A strong economy and declining use of crack
cocaine also contributed to improved neighborhood security.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Thomas Menino, Reps. Joe Moakley, Barney Frank and Michael Capuano,
and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, all Democrats, and several religious and community
leaders attended the address in an area where crime was down more than 65
percent last year. Attorney General Janet Reno also attended.
</P>
<P>
	   In his Roxbury appearance, Clinton also stressed the success of his 1994
crime-fighting package, which provided money for 100,000 community police
officers. The fiscal 2000 budget includes funds for 50,000 more.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, Clinton was addressing a Democratic National Committee
fund-raising reception at a private residence in a Boston suburb.

<HEADLINE> Court OKs Good Fri. School Closings  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court is letting Maryland require public
schools to close on Good Friday, but the legitimacy of that law and Good Friday
laws in more than a dozen states remains clouded.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices, acting without comment Tuesday, rejected an appeal in which a
retired Maryland teacher said the school-closings law violates constitutionally
required separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
	   In separate action, the nation's highest court turned away appeals by
Quakers who say the Internal Revenue Service violates their religious freedom by
charging fees and interest for delays in paying the portion of their federal tax
that funds the military.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the states with Good Friday laws, only Maryland, Illinois and North
Dakota require all public schools to close on that day each year. A federal
appeals court struck down the Illinois law.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices still have before them a challenge to an Indiana law
designating Good Friday a state holiday. They have not yet said whether they
will grant full review to that dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not going away,'' said Dwight Sullivan, an American Civil
Liberties Union lawyer in Baltimore. ``You have the Constitution being applied
differently in different states.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Maryland law ``sends the message to non-Christians that the state finds
Good Friday, and thus Christianity, to be a religion worth honoring while their
religion or nonreligion is not of equal importance,'' contended an appeal by
former teacher Judith Koenick.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That message is particularly significant in this case because it is being
sent to schoolchildren,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lower courts rejected her argument. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
said the long weekend's legitimate purpose is to avoid anticipated high
absenteeism among teachers and students on the days surrounding Easter, the
holiest of Christian holidays.
</P>
<P>
	   Good Friday, always two days before Easter Sunday, commemorates the
crucifixion of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
	   Montgomery County schools also are closed on Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of
Atonement, and the first day of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year. Those policy
decisions are based not on anticipated absenteeism but on findings that large
numbers of students would be absent if schools were open on those days.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryland law does not require school closings for any Jewish holiday. State
law designates these public school holidays: Thanksgiving and the day after;
Christmas Eve through Jan. 1; the Friday before Easter through the Monday after;
Memorial Day; and primary and general election days.
</P>
<P>
	   State and federal courts are divided, the justices were told, over the
constitutionality of laws or governmental practices that deal with Good Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Ms. Koenick urged the court ``to bring order to the lower
courts' chaotic decisions concerning governmental recognition of Good Friday.''
</P>
<P>
	   But lawyers for the Montgomery County Board of Education said the four-day
holiday ``is anchored around the increasingly secularized holiday of Easter,
which is a traditional time for Marylanders, like many other Americans, to begin
Easter-related travel.''
</P>
<P>
	   The justices were told that 13 states have Good Friday laws: Delaware,
Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, North
Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
	   California and Kentucky have laws establishing part of Good Friday as a
holiday for government employees, and in Texas the day is an ``optional
holiday'' for state employees.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Quakers' case, the court turned away arguments by three Religious
Society of Friends members from New England and Pennsylvania. The action let the
IRS continue charging late fees and interest in addition to their back taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals filed on behalf of Gordon and Edith Browne, who have homes in
New Hampshire and Vermont, and Priscilla Lippincott Adams of Philadelphia did
not contest having to pay 100 percent of their tax bill when the tax agency
forces their hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the Quakers cited a ``religious hardship'' and argued that they
should be able to pay the back taxes without any penalties or interest.
</P>
<P>
	   They said that as a result of religious faith and study, they cannot
voluntarily pay that portion of their federal income taxes which they determine
are dedicated to war and war-related activities.
</P>
<P>
	   In rejecting those arguments, lower courts relied on a 1982 Supreme Court
decision that said, ``The tax system could not function if denominations were
allowed to challenge (it) because tax payments were spent in a manner that
violates their religious belief.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Turns Attention to 4 Countries  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the Clinton administration heads into its final year,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright singled out four countries -- Colombia,
Nigeria, Indonesia and Ukraine -- for special attention and U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Each can be a major force for stability and progress in its region, and
each is at a critical point along the democratic path,'' Albright said in a
speech on democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright did not say how much assistance the administration planned for the
four countries beyond $1.6 billion for Colombia that she announced on her trip
to the South American country last weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Indonesia received $86.5 million last year, and the administration actually
is requesting a decrease, to $80 million, this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Nigeria received $12.5 million last year and the adminsitration is asking
for $20 million this year, but may increase the request, and Ukraine received
$195 million last year while $219 million is being requested this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The struggle in Colombia is not between right and left, rich and poor, or
between one ethnic group and another,'' she said. ``It is between those who want
to pursue prosperity and social development democratically and those addicted to
criminality, violence and corruption.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nigeria, she said, has had its U.S. aid nearly quadrupled under President
Clinton in an effort to help Nigerians deal with threats to stability and
democracy. The African country is faced with a high-stakes test of democracy,
Albright said, and ``we must do all we can to help them succeed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indonesia's President Abdurrahman Wahid deserves support as he tries to
stabilize the economy, deepen civilian control of the military, establish the
rule of law, maintain national unity and respect human rights, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   She called Ukraine a partner and friend of the United States threatened with
economic decline, corruption and crime. ``We will continue to help our partner
move down the path to deeper reform, fuller freedom and sustained growth,'' she
said.

<HEADLINE> CDC Reports on Women and Smoking  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Smoking declined significantly among American women of
childbearing age between 1987 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the number of such
women who had ever smoked declined from 44.1 percent to 38.2 percent. Also, the
number of women of childbearing age who smoked at the time they were surveyed
dropped from 16.3 percent to 11.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The results of the telephone survey of 187,302 women ages 18 to 44 appear in
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association. The women surveyed were
from 33 states.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers, led by Dr. Shahul Ebrahim, said that women who said they
were pregnant were about half as likely to be current smokers as those who were
not -- a ratio that fluctuated only slightly over the 10-year survey period.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1987, 16.3 percent of the pregnant women reported being smokers and 26.7
percent of the non-pregnant women said they smoked. By 1996, only 11.8 percent
of the pregnant women smoked and only 23.6 of the non-pregnant women did.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers said the decline in the number of pregnant women who smoke was
probably related to fewer women taking up smoking in the first place, rather
than more women quitting smoking because they were pregnant.
</P>
<P>
	   Their findings mirrored those of a CDC survey released in 1998, which showed
similar percentage declines from 1990 to 1996 for pregnant and non-pregnant
women in the same age range.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers cautioned that because the latest survey excluded women
without telephones, women younger than 18, and those who did not live in private
residences, they may have underestimated the actual prevalence of smoking.

<HEADLINE> Study Renews Tobacco Test Concerns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Smokers of cigarettes supposedly low in tar and nicotine
may actually inhale twice as much of those dangerous chemicals as numbers on the
packs indicate, says a new study that renews concern about government cigarette
testing.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Trade Commission already warns smokers to be skeptical of the
tar and nicotine measurements tobacco companies derive using a machine-testing
method the FTC created 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers in the mid-1990s reported that smokers were inhaling more tar
and nicotine than the FTC machine measures, because smokers take more puffs,
puff longer and deeper and cover air vents supposed to filter some chemicals
from cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
	   The FTC has been unable to come up with a new, better testing method. The
tobacco industry has long contended that every smoker smokes differently anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest study, reported Tuesday in the Journal of the National Cancer
Institute, analyzed the volume of smoke inhaled by 133 smokers puffing their
usual brands of low-nicotine or medium-nicotine cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers at the American Health Foundation in Valhalla, N.Y., concluded
that smokers of low-nicotine cigarettes inhaled 2.5 times more nicotine and 2.6
times more tar than FTC testing indicated they should have. For medium-nicotine
cigarettes, smokers received 2.2 times more nicotine and 1.9 times more tar.
</P>
<P>
	   "A smoker who uses the FTC ratings to choose a brand of cigarettes with
lower amounts of carcinogenic agents will not achieve the reduction
anticipated," the researchers concluded.

<HEADLINE> Impotence Reported After Surgery  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTHA IRVINE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- One of the largest surveys of men who had their cancerous
prostates removed found that nearly 60 percent were impotent and more than 8
percent lacked bladder control more than a year and a half later.
</P>
<P>
	   While such side effects of the surgery are well known, the figures could
help patients make the difficult decision of whether to have their prostates
removed.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's clearly a large effect on men's quality of life, and I think it's
important they go into the surgery knowing that," said Janet Stanford, a
researcher at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle who led the
study.
</P>
<P>
	   The study appears in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers are still following the men who answered the survey and are
trying to determine whether their impotence remained five years after surgery
and whether Viagra worked for them.
</P>
<P>
	   Cancer of the prostate, a gland involved in semen production, is the second
most common type of cancer found in American men, behind skin cancer. A total of
179,300 were diagnosed with the disease in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Treatments include what is known as a radical prostatectomy -- the removal
of the prostate -- and radiation. Doctors also often recommend "watchful
waiting," or leaving the cancer untreated, in elderly men who are more likely to
die first from other ailments.
</P>
<P>
	   For the study, researchers surveyed 1,291 men beginning in 1994 who had
undergone a radical prostatectomy within six months of being diagnosed with
prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   The study is considered to be one of the most comprehensive because
participants were from six states and were black, Hispanic and white. The
patients also ranged in age from 39 to 79.
</P>
<P>
	   Previous studies found a wide range of difficulties with incontinence and
impotence a year or more after patients' prostates were removed -- 4 percent to
40 percent reported problems holding their bladders and 29 percent to 75 percent
reported trouble getting and maintaining erections.
</P>
<P>
	   In this study, researchers found that patients who had surgery that spared
one or two bundles of nerves in the area were less likely to be impotent.
</P>
<P>
	   About 59 percent of those who had unilateral nerve-sparing procedures (in
which one of two nerve bundles can be saved) and 56 percent of those who
underwent bilteral nerve sparing (both nerve bundles remain) said they were
impotent 18 months or more after the surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 66 percent of those whose nerves were not spared said they could not
keep or sustain an erection. Doctors say the nerves can regenerate, but that can
take up to two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Surgeons at two major research institutions said they have had even better
results.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. William Catalona, who performs about eight radical prostatectomies a
week at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said he has
found that 86 percent of men under 50 are able to regain sexual function after
surgery in which the fewest number of nerves are damaged or disturbed. The
percentage lessens with age all the way to 42 percent for those older than 70,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the patients are young and have good erections before surgery -- and if
they are treated by a surgeon who specializes in this sort of surgery -- then
the results are excellent," said Catalona, the school's chief of urological
surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Charles Brendler, head of urological surgery at the University of
Chicago Medical Center, said he has also found that younger men are more likely
to retain sexual function. But he said even doctors who specialize in the
surgery must learn new techniques to prevent post-surgery impotence.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're doing well getting rid of the cancer and with urinary control," he
said. But, he added, where sexual function is concerned, "We're a long way from
perfect."

<HEADLINE> Paine Webber Profits Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Paine Webber Group Inc., the fourth-largest U.S. brokerage
firm, reported Tuesday its profits rose in the fourth quarter from a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   But the October-December figure was reduced by the $60 million buyback of
preferred stock from the GE Capital Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings, after taking the buyback into account, were $101.5 million, or 67
cents a share, compared with $94.5 million, or 63 cents a share in the same
period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding the one-time stock buyback charge, Paine Webber earned $166.3
million, or $1.07 a share. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had
predicted earnings of 92 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth quarter revenues after interest expenses were $1.39 billion, up from
$1.1 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Paine Webber were trading late Tuesday at $37.87 1/2, down 6 1/2
cents on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our 1999 results reflect strength across all business lines, including
record results in commissions, asset management, investment banking and
principal transactions," Paine Webber chairman and chief executive Donald Marron
said in a statement with the earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the firm's 1999 financial highlights were a 20 percent increase in
client assets over 1998 to $423 billion from $352 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the number of customers using PaineWebber EDGE, the company's
online brokerage service, more than doubled in 1999 to 176,000 households from
71,000 at the end of 1998. Assets invested with the service also doubled, to
$140 billion in 1999 from $60 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, Paine Webber earned $545.9 million, or $3.56 a share,
after taking into account the stock buyback. In 1998, the company earned $409.9
million, or $2.72 a share. Revenues for the year, after interest expense, were
$5.29 billion, up from $4.41 billion a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Consumers Paying Debt More Quickly  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Personal bankruptcy rates are coming down from historic
highs as many consumers have sped up repayment of their credit card debts, a
consumer group said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Consumer Federation of America said 112,000 fewer people filed for and
received bankruptcy court protection last year than in 1998. That's an 8 percent
drop to under 1.3 million that the federation termed the largest one-year
decline on record.
</P>
<P>
	   More cautious borrowing by consumers is at the heart of the decrease, the
federation said, saying that has forced credit card companies to restrain their
solicitations and lures. For the first time in a decade, the group said, credit
card lenders have curbed the expansion of credit lines, or limits, offered to
their customers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Consumers have increasingly just said 'no' to credit card solicitations,"
Stephen Brobeck, executive director of Consumer Federation, said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   While 2.8 percent of consumers accepted unsolicited offers of new credit
cards in 1992, that dropped to 1 percent in January-September 1999, Brobeck
said.
</P>
<P>
	   And lenders have reduced the number of solicitations. They mailed an
estimated 2.4 billion credit card solicitations in the first nine months of last
year, compared with 3.5 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Brobeck said, many consumers with credit card debts have
realized the importance of paying more than the minimum required on their
monthly bills. They are sending heftier payments as well as defaulting less
frequently on their debts, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The data were released a week before the Senate is scheduled to resume
debate on major bipartisan legislation, pushed by credit card companies and
retail businesses, that would make it tougher for people to erase their debts in
bankruptcy court. The House approved parallel legislation last May by a
veto-proof margin, 313-108.
</P>
<P>
	   Proponents of the legislation have said it was needed to stanch a rising
tide of personal bankruptcies that had occurred despite the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Brobeck and other Consumer Federation officials said that given the decline
in personal bankruptcies, the legislation was overly harsh and not needed.
</P>
<P>
	   But the banking industry and lawmakers who support the legislation say that
even with the decline, personal bankruptcies remain at historic high levels and
legislation is needed to prevent abuse of the bankruptcy process by some
consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of Americans filing personal bankruptcies in 1998, at nearly 1.4
million, was up more than 300 percent from 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's good news that consumers are showing restraint," said Patricia
Boerger, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association. She added, however,
that the recent decline does not ensure a long-term trend.
</P>
<P>
	   "The reality is that the current bankruptcy (law) is broken," Ms. Boerger
said. "It allows people who can afford to pay their debts to walk away."
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, she said, credit card lenders are forced to raise rates for
responsible consumers, costing households an average $400 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The group's data are based in part on a new study by economist Lawrence
Ausubel, an economics professor at the University of Maryland, whose figures
indicate personal bankruptcies declined to 1,285,800 last year from 1,397,700 in
1998, down 8 percent. The drop continued last year, he found.
</P>
<P>
	   Figures released last year by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts,
which oversees bankruptcy judges, among others, also showed a decline. For
example, they showed personal bankruptcies declining 2 percent during the 12
months ended June 30, 1999, the first yearly decrease since 1995.

<HEADLINE> State Supreme Court Justice M. Dolores Denman dies in Florida  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Justice M. Dolores Denman, the first woman named
presiding justice in one of New York's four Appellate Divisions of state Supreme
Court, has died of cancer. She was 68.
<P>
	   Denman was the top judge in New York's Western District since 1991, when she
was appointed by then-Gov. Mario Cuomo to the Appellate Division's Fourth
Judicial Department in Rochester. She died Monday at her second home in Naples,
Fla., surrounded by her family.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's chief judge, Judith Kaye, said she was "grieving in every
respect - for the loss of an extraordinary administrative board colleague, a
remarkable presiding justice, an outstanding jurist and a fabulous friend."
</P>
<P>
	   "What a role model for women - indeed, for everyone who loves the law," Kaye
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Court of Appeals Judge Richard Wesley, who served with Denman on appellate
division appeals court panels, called Denman a pioneer.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those of us who served with her loved her and respected her for her
commitment to excellence in the law," Wesley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Denman resigned because of her illness on Dec. 15, but the resignation
didn't go into effect until last Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Denman was one of the first two women to serve in the Appellate Division,
the state's second-highest court. She and state Supreme Court Justice Ann T.
Mikoll were appointed in 1977.
</P>
<P>
	   Denman was a Buffalo City Court judge from 1972 to 1976 and an Erie County
assistant district attorney for three years before that. In 1978, she narrowly
lost the Democratic primary for state attorney general to Robert Abrams.
</P>
<P>
	   Denman, formerly Mary Dolores Welch, was a Buffalo native. She is survived
by her husband of 35 years, James Denman; two sons, Daniel Stanton of Ridgewood,
N.J., and James Lindsay Denman of New York; a daughter, Diana Denman of Atlanta;
and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
	   A burial mass was planned for 10 a.m. Saturday in St. Joseph's Cathedral in

<HEADLINE> CDC Reports on Women and Smoking  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Smoking declined significantly among American women of
childbearing age between 1987 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the number of such
women who had ever smoked declined from 44.1 percent to 38.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The results of the telephone survey of 187,302 women ages 18 to 44 appear in
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association. The women surveyed were
from 33 states.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers, led by Dr. Shahul Ebrahim, said that women who said they
were pregnant were about half as likely to be current smokers as those who were
not -- a ratio that fluctuated only slightly over the 10-year survey period.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1987, 16.3 percent of the pregnant women reported being smokers and 26.7
percent of the non-pregnant women said they smoked. By 1996, only 11.8 percent
of the pregnant women smoked and only 23.6 of the non-pregnant women did.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers said the decline in the number of pregnant women who smoke was
probably related to fewer women taking up smoking in the first place, rather
than more women quitting smoking because they were pregnant.
</P>
<P>
	   Their findings mirrored those of a CDC survey released in 1998, which showed
similar percentage declines from 1990 to 1996 for pregnant and non-pregnant
women in the same age range.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers cautioned that because the latest survey excluded women
without telephones, women younger than 18, and those who did not live in private
residences, they may have underestimated the actual prevalence of smoking.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan Warned To Tone Down  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHY GANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Three U.S. delegations are whirling through
Pakistan this week, all carrying the same message for their host and neighboring
India: ``Turn down the heat.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last month's hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane unleashed a blistering
war of words between the two rival countries -- who also happen to be the
world's newest nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan's military leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has warned India he's not
a man to turn the other cheek to the relentless ``flak from across the border.''
S.K. Singh, a former top official in India's Foreign Ministry, responded that
Musharraf's comment was regarded as ``a threat, which we take very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts fear the verbal sparring could take both countries, which have
fought three wars, back to the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a very real danger of a conflict, because you become the prisoner
of your own rhetoric and you begin a spiral of action and reaction and you end
up doing things you didn't plan to do,'' said Riffat Hussein, a political
analyst at Pakistan's Qaid-e-Azam University.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are in for a period of very high tension,'' said Dr. Tanvir Ahmed at
Pakistan's Institute of Strategic Studies. ``Both countries think they can
manage the tension ... but you never know.''
</P>
<P>
	   That uncertainty explains, in part, the visits to Pakistan by three sets of
high-ranking Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth is to arrive Thursday, the
highest U.S. official to visit since the military threw out the elected
government in October.
</P>
<P>
	   He follows Republican Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas, who followed four Senate
Democrats -- Minority leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, Christopher Dodd of
Connecticut, Harry Reid of Nevada and Daniel Akaka of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott on Wednesday
began two days of meetings in London with India Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The subject is a continuation of the security and nonproliferation
dialogue the United States has been having with India, and reducing tensions
with Pakistan, and other issues of mutual concern on the India subcontinent,''
said U.S. Embassy spokesman Rod Francis.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan's Musharraf was quoted in an Indian newspaper Monday as saying he
suspected India would use the London talks to try to get Pakistan declared a
terrorist state. On Wednesday, he was in China, a traditional ally of Pakistan,
and observers in Islamabad said the general would use the visit to strengthen
the alliance against India.
</P>
<P>
	   Brownback likened tensions between Pakistan and India to a slow gas leak
waiting to explode. Given that both countries possess nuclear weapons, he warned
an explosion would be catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
	   India and Pakistan deeply distrust each other and seem to be resisting
efforts to get them to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a total breakdown of communications,'' said Hussein, the
political analyst. ``They are just not on talking terms with each other. This is
unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
	   India has verbally attacked Pakistan relentlessly, accusing its neighbor of
ordering the Dec. 24-31 hijacking in which one passenger was killed. India also
has alleged that all five hijackers were Pakistanis and is seeking to have
Pakistan declared a terrorist state.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan denies involvement in the hijacking and says India is trying to
deflect anger at home because it botched the handling of the hijacking, which
ended with India's release of three pro-Kashmir militants.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan says it will talk to India when New Delhi is ready to discuss
Kashmir, the divided territory claimed by both countries. India says it will
talk to Pakistan when cross-border terrorism ends.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You would not sit down and talk to someone who is sending, daily,
marauders to your homestead, killing your people, making it impossible to live
in peace,'' Singh, the former foreign secretary, said in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
	   In the ongoing tit-for-tat exchanges, Pakistan on Tuesday ordered an Indian
Embassy employee to leave Pakistan within seven days after the man was allegedly
found carrying a bomb.
</P>
<P>
	   The day before, a bomb killed eight people in Karachi, in southern
Pakistan's Sindh province. The provincial governor blamed India, but offered no
evidence to back up the allegation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I see a rough ride ahead,'' Hussein said. ``There is very little meeting
ground between the two countries right now.''

<HEADLINE> Diana Being Honored in London Parks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Princess Diana will be remembered with a memorial fountain
built along a dedicated walkway winding through central London's parks,
Chancellor Gordon Brown said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The fountain's location and design have yet to be decided but it will not
incorporate a Princess Diana statue, said Brown, who also chairs a government
committee overseeing the memorial.
</P>
<P>
	   Since her death in a 1997 car crash in Paris, the only official
commemorations in Britain have been a coin bearing Princess Diana's likeness and
a few community service and charity awards and projects established in her name.
</P>
<P>
	   The fountain is believed to be the favored option of Prince William, 17,
Prince Harry, 15, and the Spencer family.
</P>
<P>
	   Final details of the $2.78 million walkway were also released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan is to mark the walk with 70 plaques set into the ground and 1.3
million spring bulbs along the borders. It will pass through Kensington Gardens
-- close to Diana's former residence at Kensington Palace -- and St. James's
Park.
</P>
<P>
	   From the walkway, visitors will get views of buildings and locations
associated with the princess during her life.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of the Diana memorial playground in Kensington Gardens are due to be
released Thursday. The $2.12 million project is expected to have a Peter Pan
theme because J.M. Barrie, creator of the children's classic, funded the present
playground on the site in 1906.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the walkway and playground are due to open July 1, which would have
been Diana's 39th birthday.

<HEADLINE> Groups Urge Elian's Return to Cuba  </HEADLINE>
   By REBECCA SINDERBRAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders of several Cuban-American and religious groups
that want Elian Gonzalez returned to his father in Cuba said Tuesday they were
prepared to call for protests and acts of civil disobedience if the child is not
sent back soon.
</P>
<P>
	   They urged Janet Reno to enforce the decision of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service and release the boy to his father's custody in Cuba
before Congress or the courts become any more involved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The attorney general doesn't even need to wait'' for the courts and
Congress to act, said Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y. ``She has the final say. There
is still time for her to send Elian back to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   He sharply criticized some groups that oppose the boy's return, saying they
have ``inserted themselves into the process.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Both political parties are in a race to see who can 'out-Miami Cuban' the
other,'' said Serrano.
</P>
<P>
	   The assembled activists had tough words for the Florida courts, contending
that state Judge Rosa Rodriguez, who issued an order blocking Elian's return,
deliberately concealed campaign ties to man who has been prominent in the effort
to keep the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling the judge ``a disgrace,'' Serrano said, ``Judge Rodriguez should
resign from the bench.''
</P>
<P>
	   Those in attendance also denounced Congress for considering legislation that
would grant U.S. citizenship to the 6-year-old over his father's objections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Imposing citizenship on people feels a little like imposing religion on
people,'' said Joan Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches, which
supports returning Elian to Cuba. ``You don't impose religion, and you don't
impose citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell said she had met with the father, Juan Gonzalez, and other family
members, and promised them her organization would fight on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nations don't raise children. Fathers and mothers and families raise
children,'' said Campbell.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael McCormick, director of the American Coalition for Fathers and
Children, also pledged his group's support for Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This should be a matter of parenting, not of politics,'' said McCormick,
whose group has filed an amicus brief with the INS on Juan Gonzalez's behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of half a dozen organizations, including the Cuban American Alliance
Education Fund, participated in today's event.

<HEADLINE> Lagerfeld Chanel Collection a Hit  </HEADLINE>
   By SUZY PATTERSON AP Fashion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) -- Festive, colorful and fun. Karl Lagerfeld's spring haute
couture collection for Chanel on Tuesday proved that grand couture still has a
place, and can be wearable.
</P>
<P>
	   Chanel got the crowds out to a Bois de Boulogne battered by December's
killer storms, but the show held in a riding club's big ring galloped along at a
joyous pace.
</P>
<P>
	   On hand to admire Lagerfeld's work were fashion collector Mouna Ayoub, film
stars Carole Bouquet, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Kristen Scott-Thomas.
</P>
<P>
	   What they saw will not shake the world apart, but were splendid Chanel
styles: the classic pink tweed suit with a pleated skirt, lavender and navy
knee-length suits with flared, maybe wrapped skirts.
</P>
<P>
	   Fitted or boxy jackets, sometimes fastened with gold and pearl Chanel safety
pins looked traditional yet wonderfully up-to-date.
</P>
<P>
	   Long taffeta jackets and longer skirts had something of the riding-outfit
look of last century, but also a less uptight taste of the good old 1947 New
Look.
</P>
<P>
	   The wonderful almost ankle-length organza skirts couldn't look lighter, and
an occasional evening gown in square silky panels fairly bobbed by.
</P>
<P>
	   Colors from hot chartreuse or amethyst to flame red trotted jauntily round
the ring and up on a platform. And if the frilly miniskirted ballerina in pink
was a bit fey, the icy tones of charmeuse satin in bias-cut dresses showed off
the Lagerfeld know-how.
</P>
<P>
	   Absolutely perfect for a fashion fan would be the long almond green dress
with sparkly field-flower embroideries crawling up the skirt.
</P>
<P>
	   And to close the riding ring's gala gallop were a puffy strapless iridescent
pink mother-of-pearl taffeta gown and the ivory taffeta-clad bridal gown -- both
fluttering with ostrich feathers -- as were many of the other outfits in the
lively show.
</P>
<P>
	   Like John Galliano showing for Dior this week, Lagerfeld was once a cutup,
with odd, even raggedy costumes on the runway. Some thought this irreverence
brilliant. But it's even harder to show fascinating wearable clothes than
junk-heap attractions.
</P>
<P>
	   Hanae Mori's spring show featured lots of wearable fluid crepe trouser
suits, with the signature draping, or perhaps fancy silver or braided frog
fastenings. Colors were strong -- French blue, bright red, shocking pink or
white.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides day clothes like the sharp navy pinstriped pantsuit with a chunky
rose jacket fastening and white piped collar, there were plenty of gorgeous
late-day choices, including the sweet lace and light green silk dress with lily
of the valley motifs.
</P>
<P>
	   A white silk strapless column dress with ostrich feathers on the stole was
both discreet and handsome.
</P>
<P>
	   And there were the ravishing ``garden'' dresses with intricate beaded
embroidery in flower and birds of paradise on graded shades of daffodil and
pearly gray silk. Definitely signature stuff for the style of the very feminine
Mrs. Mori from Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   Christian Lacroix turned in a wonderfully colorful -- and artistic -- show
at the Beaux Arts school.
</P>
<P>
	   The witty and wearable party gear showed off Lacroix's great talent for
modern art, from abstract graffiti designs to a sensual use of different fabric
surfaces.
</P>
<P>
	   The clever fabric-contrast effects on some fabulously cut evening wear
brought gasps from the audience.
</P>
<P>
	   Think of the several to-knee short outfits, such as a hot yellow cardigan
coat, with licorice-like plastic details over a teal and royal blue chiffon
dress with embroidered dickey.
</P>
<P>
	   Another shortie to watch was a gorgeous checked two-layered chiffon dress in
coral shades, asymmetric and scalloped. Hems are up and down here, a zany kind
of approach -- along with much sensual use of fabrics in luxury patchwork. The
sparkly lace shorts jumpsuit with its flyaway white organza capelet was a winner
for a young couture wearer.
</P>
<P>
	   But Lacroix took off with real evening wear -- graphics, light layers,
Miro-like painting effects on chiffon. And for the grandest moment, his outfit
of a moire taffeta Van Dyck fitted jacket with puffy sparkly gauze sleeves and a
mother-of-pearl and rhinestone skirt could not be beat for effect.

<HEADLINE> City unveils plan to prevent encephalitis outbreak  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The Giuliani administration's plan to prevent another
outbreak of West Nile virus this spring emphasizes killing mosquitoes before
they mature and have a chance to infect humans.
<P>
	   The city's $3.5 million abatement plan calls on health workers to trap and
test mosquitoes for the virus, apply larvacide in their breeding grounds and
step-up the use of sentinel birds to detect mosquito-borne viruses. Trapping has
already started and health officials are awaiting lab results.
</P>
<P>
	   The city will also launch an extensive public education campaign on
preventing mosquitoes from breeding. Officials also plan to track encephalitis
cases in hospitals in northern Queens, where the outbreak was first spotted last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am extremely confident that the surveillance, control and education
program directed by this plan will effectively complement the strong public
health surveillance program already in place," said health commissioner Neal
Cohen, speaking at a hearing before the City Council's Committee on Health.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the West Nile virus killed seven people, infected 52 others and
killed several horses and at least 5,000 birds in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York City alone, there were 45 human cases, including four deaths in
Queens.
</P>
<P>
	   For much of the outbreak, some city residents were as fearful of the
pesticides used to kill the virus-carry mosquitoes as they were of the virus
itself.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said Tuesday that the city would spray again only as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
	   Epidemiologists say that the winter is the best time to launch a
preventative strike against mosquitoes because the insects are largely inactive
in cold weather and existing populations are clustered in and around basements,
sewers, catch basins, subway tunnels and other damp places.

<HEADLINE> Schwab Earnings Rise in 4th Quarter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Earnings for Charles Schwab Corp. rose nearly 60
percent for the fourth quarter and 70 percent for the year, exceeding analysts'
expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's largest discount and online brokerage on Tuesday reported
earnings of $170 million or 20 cents a share on sales of $1.1 billion, up from
$106 million, or 12 cents a share, on sales of $789 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   That exceeded the forecast of 19 cents a share by analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thompson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwab said it brought in a record $33 billion in new assets to the firm
during the fourth quarter, which pushed new assets for the year to a record $107
billion, up 35 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
	   "The securities markets have experienced major swings in returns and trading
volumes," said Chairman and CEO Charles R. Schwab. "Throughout this challenging
environment, everyone at Schwab has stayed focused on delivering the best
possible service to our customers."
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Schwab earned $589 million or 70 cents a share on sales of
$3.9 billion compared to profits of $349 million or 42 cents a share in the
previous year. Sales for 1999 were $2.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts had predicted yearend earnings of 69 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Customers opened 1.5 million new accounts during the year and Schwab said it
was handling 6.6 million active accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwab stock fell $1.88 to $39.13 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 162.26  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks drove the Nasdaq composite index
tantalizingly close to a new record today, while blue-chip shares tumbled as
worries about rising interest rates distracted investors from strong
fourth-quarter corporate earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
	   According to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
162.26 to close at 11,604.15. Profit-taking following last week's rally also
contributed to some selling.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq rose 66.66 to 4,130.93, just shy of its Jan. 3 closing record of
4,131.15. The Nasdaq has now gone through 10 straight sessions without setting a
new record, the longest streak since late October, when the technology-dominated
index began a sprint that lasted through the start of the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 10.01 to 1,455.14.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,827 down, 1,301 up and 429 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.01 billion shares as of 4 p.m., compared with 1.07
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.81 to 513.43.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq rallied today following the merger of JDS Uniphase and E-Tek
Dynamics, two companies that make components used in optical networking. JDS
Uniphase offered $15 billion, or about $211 per share, for E-Tek. Today, E-Tek
soared, while JDS Uniphase ended slightly higher.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft, which was releasing its earnings after the close of trading, rose
as investors anticipated a strong report.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq's rally was a return to form for the index that soared 86 percent
in 1999 on the strength of large, well-established technology companies, from
network providers like Cisco Systems to software leaders like Microsoft. Jeffrey
Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers, said today those
stocks are likely to lead the market in 2000 as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no question these stocks are expensive, but we believe it's
deservedly so," he said. "They have the best fundamentals."
</P>
<P>
	   Several Fortune 500 companies today reported stronger than expected
fourth-quarter earnings, including pharmaceutical firm Pfizer and financial
services companies Citigroup and PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite their strong profit reports, Pfizer and Citigroup finished with
slight losses, while PaineWebber rose only modestly.
</P>
<P>
	   Many investors were distracted by concerns about interest rates. The yield
on the Treasury's 30-year bond was up to 6.74 percent today from late Friday's
6.69 percent, reaching levels not seen since July 1997. The financial markets
were closed Monday for the holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts expect the Federal Reserve to boost interest rates a quarter
percentage point when it meets Feb. 1-2. The Fed's three rate hikes last year
did little to slow the economy, and the central bank is expected to raise rates
again this year to prevent inflation from accelerating.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial companies, which are most sensitive to interest rate changes, were
mostly lower. American Express and General Electric, which has a large finance
business in its GE Capital unit, led the Dow lower.
</P>
<P>
	   Pharmaceutical concerns, which have rallied so far this year, slumped
following Monday's announcement of the planned merger of British drugmakers
SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo Wellcome. SmithKline's and Glaxo's U.S. shares
dropped 5 to 55.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said some selling of blue chip stocks was to be expected after the
Dow rose 200 points Friday for its first finish about 11,700.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a pause to refresh, and I would use it as a buying opportunity,"
said Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc.
in St. Louis.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Defense Minister Resigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's defense minister resigned Tuesday after
days of speculation that he had links with organized crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Elcio Alvares declined to give any specific reason for resigning.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to make clear that the same way I entered the ministry is the way
I'll leave the ministry, with complete support of the president,'' Alvares said
after meeting with President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
	   Alvares said he will remain minister of defense until a substitute can be
named.
</P>
<P>
	   Alvares, a former senator with the conservative Liberal Front Party, became
the first civilian head of the armed forces when the defense ministry was
created in June 1999 with the combination of the air force, navy and army
ministries.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Whitman signs law to allow police retirements after 20 years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman signed a law Tuesday allowing
police officers and paid firefighters to retire with pensions after 20 years and
to give pensions to survivors whose spouses die while off-duty.
<P>
	   The law permits many emergency services personnel to retire if they chose to
while in their 40s with a pension set at half their highest annual salary.
</P>
<P>
	   It also provides a lifetime pension to widows and other survivors of police
officers and firefighters who die in off-duty accidents or of illness before
they retire. It replaces what had been a standard, lump sum life-insurance
payment equal to 3 1/2 years' salary.
</P>
<P>
	   Municipal and city police officers and firefighters had to wait 25 years
before retiring at 65 percent salary, an option they may still choose to qualify
for the higher pension. If they wait until 30 years to retire, the pension is
set at 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The costs associated with this enhanced benefits package continued to be a
source of controversy up to the last minute as the Legislature voted on the bill
last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The approval of expanded benefits came despite opposition from municipal
officials who fear the impact of a rash of early retirements on their public
safety programs and local budgets.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are extremely disappointed that the bill was signed intact" without
amendments, said William Dressel, director of the state League of
Municipalities.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the bill was unanimously opposed in December by the state's Pension
and Health Benefits Review Commission, an advisory panel that counts among its
members state Treasurer Roland Machold and state Personnel Commissioner Janice
Mintz. The commission worried about millions the pension system will need to
cover the new benefits for future retirees.
</P>
<P>
	   The law will require the pension fund to have $338 million more than is now
available in it. Machold's office concluded that plugging this hole would
require annual payments starting at $52 million. The original law hit municipal
governments with most of this cost but amendments approved in December shifted
the entire cost to the state budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill sponsors and the Office of Legislative Services said steady growth in
the pension funds' Wall Street holdings may add enough value to offset any need
for higher payments.
</P>
<P>
	   State troopers and their families currently enjoy the 20-year retirement and
their survivors quality for life pensions currently. However, troopers also face
mandatory retirement at age 55, a policy which some local police departments
also follow but which is not mandated in state law.
</P>
<P>
	   One sponsor, Assemblyman John Kelly, R-Essex, said it was only fair to match
benefits between troopers and local police. He said the 20-year retirement
benefit would not trigger an exodus from the ranks, noting that few troopers
take advantage of early retirement.

    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The Giuliani administration's plan to prevent another
outbreak of West Nile virus this spring emphasizes killing mosquitoes before
they mature and have a chance to infect humans.
<P>
	   The city's $3.5 million abatement plan calls on health workers to trap and
test mosquitoes for the virus, apply larvacide in their breeding grounds and
step-up the use of sentinel birds to detect mosquito-borne viruses. Trapping has
already started and health officials are awaiting lab results.
</P>
<P>
	   The city will also launch an extensive public education campaign on
preventing mosquitoes from breeding. Officials also plan to track encephalitis
cases in hospitals in northern Queens, where the outbreak was first spotted last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am extremely confident that the surveillance, control and education
program directed by this plan will effectively complement the strong public
health surveillance program already in place," said health commissioner Neal
Cohen, speaking at a hearing before the City Council's Committee on Health.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the West Nile virus killed seven people, infected 52 others and
killed several horses and at least 5,000 birds in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York City alone, there were 45 human cases, including four deaths in
Queens.
</P>
<P>
	   For much of the outbreak, some city residents were as fearful of the
pesticides used to kill the virus-carry mosquitoes as they were of the virus
itself.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said Tuesday that the city would spray again only as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
	   Epidemiologists say that the winter is the best time to launch a
preventative strike against mosquitoes because the insects are largely inactive
in cold weather and existing populations are clustered in and around basements,
sewers, catch basins, subway tunnels and other damp places.

<HEADLINE> Coke's Daft Names New No. 2 Man  </HEADLINE>
    By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Coke's management team received another shakeup Tuesday,
with incoming chairman and chief executive officer Doug Daft appointing North
American division chief Jack Stahl as the company's next president and chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
	   The Atlanta-based Coca Cola Co. said its board of directors would officially
elect Stahl to the position at its April 19 meeting. The job had been vacant
under outgoing chairman and chief executive officer M. Douglas Ivester.
</P>
<P>
	   Stahl, 46, will answer directly to Daft, the native Australian who will
officially take over for Ivester at the company's shareholders meeting in April.
The board elected Stahl as an executive vice president Tuesday until he takes
his new job.
</P>
<P>
	   Previous news reports said Ivester's refusal to name a No. 2 man was one
reason the board lost confidence in his leadership. Ivester announced last month
he would retire in April, but said he made the decision to step down on his own
after much "personal reflection."
</P>
<P>
	   Stahl, a 20-year Coke veteran, was once the company's youngest chief
financial officer, taking that office at the age of 36.
</P>
<P>
	   "Daft is the expert on the company's business outside the U.S., and Stahl is
the expert on the American business and finance side of things," said John
Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. "These two men make a
formidable team."
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement is the latest in a series of moves Daft has made to shore
up his executive staff.
</P>
<P>
	   He lured Carl Ware, the company's highest-ranking black executive, back from
a planned retirement to run a newly created division and named a new head of the
European division and a new chief marketing officer.
</P>
<P>
	   The board officially approved those moves Tuesday as well. Ware, new Europe
chief Charles S. Frenette, new chief marketing officer Stephen C. Jones, new
operations support head James E. Chestnut and general counsel Joseph R. Gladden
Jr. all were named executive vice presidents.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we're going to see a major change in how this company is governed
and managed," Sicher said. "Doug Daft wants people who are running the non-U.S.
parts of the business to be headquartered in their respective markets."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, rumors of future layoffs continued to percolate, the latest
stemming from an analyst's prediction that the company will layoff as many as
2,000 midlevel managers
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Pecoriello of Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. said Tuesday that the layoffs
will be part of Coke's "greatest sea change in its business in 20 years."
</P>
<P>
	   Company spokesman Ben Deutsch said the company would not comment on possible
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do not comment on rumor and speculation," Deutsch said. "The new
management team of the company is examining every aspect of operations."
</P>
<P>
	   Pecoriello also said in an analytical report that Coke plans to shift its
approach away from selling as much product as possible and toward "a realistic
view of the volume growth the system can support given the realities of the
world economies."
</P>
<P>
	   He also predicted the stock would reach $71 a share within the next year as
the Asian markets, particularly Japan, strengthen after an economic crisis that
hurt Coke's sales for much of the last two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke's stock was selling at $64.81 1/4 a share in late trading Tuesday, up
$3.75.

<HEADLINE> Mellon Reports Profits Increase  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mellon Financial Corp. reported a 10 percent increase in
profits for the fourth quarter, matching Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, profits totaled $245 million, or 48 cents a
share, up from $222 million, or 42 cents, in the fourth quarter 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "The performance of the past quarter, which follows the completion of our
divestiture program and the sharpening of our strategic focus, clearly shows we
are in an excellent position to expand our leadership positions in our
high-growth, high-return businesses," said Martin G. McGuinn, Mellon chairman
and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   During 1999, Mellon divested itself of several businesses, including its
credit card operations, network services transaction processing unit and
mortgage business.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss of those businesses hurt the company's fee revenue for the fourth
quarter, which fell by 5 percent to $759 million, compared with the year-ago
quarter. Excluding these factors, fee revenue increased 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Net interest revenue was $353 million, down $29 million compared with $382
million in the fourth quarter of 1998. However, excluding the effect of the
divestitures, net revenue was flat.
</P>
<P>
	   Mellon's stock fell $2.43 3/4, or by 7 percent, to $31.93 3/4 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Mellon, formerly known as Mellon Bank Corp., reported profits
of $948 million, or $1.82 a share, up from 861 million, or $1.62 a share, in
1998.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Leak Hurt Peace Efforts  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Publication of the stands taken by Israel and Syria in
now-suspended negotiations hurt U.S. efforts to promote a settlement between the
two longtime foes, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   While enforcing a ``complete blackout'' of information is difficult, it is
also ``very hard to carry on diplomatic negotiations of this type'' when there
are leaks, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were unhelpful,'' Albright said, without elaborating how publication
parts of the U.S.-drafted document may have contributed to the suspension of
negotiations that had been scheduled to resume Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   A leak to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz portrayed Syria as having offered
Israel full diplomatic relations and arrangements on trade, tourism and
transportation in exchange for the strategic Golan Heights border enclave.
</P>
<P>
	   It also depicted Syria as offering to provide Israel with an early-warning
system manned by U.S. and French observers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration, in its role as mediator between Israel and
Syria, had asked both sides not to disclose what was being said in closed-door
negotiations outside Shepherdstown, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
	   A purported account of the talks appeared, however, in a Saudi newspaper
that is published in London, while anonymous ``sources'' provided some
information to reporters covering the talks, prior to the Haaretz account.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, held daily
briefings, with guarded and limited accounts of how the talks were progressing.
</P>
<P>
	   While the leak to Haaretz indicated Syria was making concessions to Israel,
reports last weekend from the region suggested Syria was upset with publication
of parts of the document.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria subsequently declined to attend the negotiations, and the talks were
suspended. Administration officials suggested the main reason was that both
sides had insisted on their demands getting priority attention.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright on Tuesday described these demands as understandable. She dismissed
the suspension as one of the many inevitable ``ups and downs and roadblocks''
that precede a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The logic of peace has been compelling for Israelis, Arabs and
Palestinians,'' she said, and all sides in the region ``genuinely desire
peace.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, Albright gave no indication when she thought the breakdown could be
repaired.
</P>
<P>
	   She said President Clinton had telephoned Syrian President Hafez Assad
Tuesday and that she talked to Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about his conversation in Boston, where he made a speech in the city's
South End, Clinton said: ``We're working at it. I think that's all I should say
right now.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I talked to him over an hour,'' Clinton said. ``We had a good talk and
we're working at it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, Albright and other administration officials have not said how they
would try to get the talks going again. Among the options, presumably, are a
Clinton-Assad meeting or a trip by Albright to the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Groups Urge Elian's Return to Cuba  </HEADLINE>
   By REBECCA SINDERBRAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders of several Cuban-American and religious groups
that want Elian Gonzalez returned to his father in Cuba said Tuesday they were
prepared to call for protests and acts of civil disobedience if the child is not
sent back soon.
</P>
<P>
	   They urged Attorney General Janet Reno to enforce the decision of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service and release the boy to his father's
custody in Cuba before Congress or the courts become any more involved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The attorney general doesn't even need to wait'' for the courts and
Congress to act, said Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y. ``She has the final say. There
is still time for her to send Elian back to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   He sharply criticized some groups that oppose the boy's return, saying they
have ``inserted themselves into the process.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Both political parties are in a race to see who can 'out-Miami Cuban' the
other,'' said Serrano.
</P>
<P>
	   The assembled activists had tough words for the Florida courts, contending
that state Judge Rosa Rodriguez, who issued an order blocking Elian's return,
deliberately concealed campaign ties to man who has been prominent in the effort
to keep the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling the judge ``a disgrace,'' Serrano said, ``Judge Rodriguez should
resign from the bench.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rodriguez has said a judge has no obligation to reveal when past campaign
supporters are involved in a case before her.
</P>
<P>
	   Those in attendance also denounced Congress for considering legislation that
would grant U.S. citizenship to the 6-year-old over his father's objections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Imposing citizenship on people feels a little like imposing religion on
people,'' said the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches,
which supports returning Elian to Cuba. ``You don't impose religion, and you
don't impose citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell said she had met with the father, Juan Gonzalez, and other family
members, and promised them her organization would fight on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nations don't raise children. Fathers and mothers and families raise
children,'' said Campbell.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael McCormick, director of the American Coalition for Fathers and
Children, also pledged his group's support for Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This should be a matter of parenting, not of politics,'' said McCormick,
whose group has filed an amicus brief with the INS on Juan Gonzalez's behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of half a dozen organizations, including the Cuban American Alliance
Education Fund, participated in the event.

<HEADLINE> Pfizer Beats Earnings Estimates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BY PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP)-- Fueled by strong sales of its best-selling drugs, Pfizer
Inc.'s fourth quarter earnings easily topped Wall Street's forecasts on Tuesday,
raising its edge in the takeover battle for rival Warner-Lambert Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer's operating profits surged 34 percent in the final quarter of 1999 to
$954 million, or 25 cents per share, compared to $711 million or 18 cents a
share a year ago. Results beat forecasts by three cents, according to analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales rose 17 percent in the quarter to $4.5 billion from $3.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   All of Pfizer's key drugs performed well in the quarter, including pills to
treat high blood pressure, depression and impotence. Sales of Viagra, Pfizer's
impotence pill, increased 19 percent to $281 million.
</P>
<P>
	   For the past two months, Pfizer has been battling to buy Warner-Lambert,
which in November agreed to a merger with American Home Products. Last week,
Warner-Lambert executives bowed to investors' pressure and said that Pfizer
appears to have a better offer. Pfizer and Warner-Lambert executives have been
meeting for the past few days to try to complete a deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert shareholders have been attracted to Pfizer because its a
faster growing and more profitable company than American Home.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anything that supports Pfizer's stock price makes their bid more attractive
to Warner-Lambert shareholders," said Linda Miller, portfolio manager of John
Hancock Global Health Sciences Fund.
</P>
<P>
	   The results didn't offer Pfizer an immediate bump in its stock, however.
Shares of the company and most other drugmakers fell Tuesday as investors took
profits following a runup during the first two weeks of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer shares fell 62 1/2 cents to $36.37 1/2 on the New York Stock
Exchange. At that closing price, Pfizer's offer would equate to about $78
billion. American Home's stock offer stands at about $56.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer has offered 2.5 shares of its stock for each Warner-Lambert share.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to strong sales of its own drugs, Pfizer gained from its share
of drugs marketed with other companies. Those drugs included the arthritis drug
Celebrex, co-marketed with Monsanto, and the cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor,
co-marketed with Warner-Lambert. Drugs sold through alliances totaled $619
million, a 107 percent increase from the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Lipitor, which had more than $3 billion in sales last year, is a key reason
why Pfizer wants to buy Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, Pfizer's operating profit rose 29 percent to $3.38 billion
or 87 cents per share. Sales rose 20 percent for the year to $16.2 billion from
$13.54 billion.

<HEADLINE> Connecticut social index rises to highest point in 9 years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Legislative leaders say they will use a report
that quantifies Connecticut's social well being to gauge the effectiveness of
the state's social policies and programs.
<P>
	   The 1999 Social State of Connecticut, an annual report on the state's
quality of life, was presented to lawmakers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   It concludes that the state's social health has improved to the highest
level in nine years, but child abuse, health care costs and poverty are stunting
the quality of life for many.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a road map for us. It's a road map of where we're headed and where we
really need to change our course," said House Speaker Moira K. Lyons,
D-Stamford.
</P>
<P>
	   Using figures from 1997, the latest figures available, the report showed
Connecticut has become a better place for workers, young children and people who
live in affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, child abuse and teen suicide increased and more people
said they could not afford rising health care costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the state's social health index was 49 out of 100 - the best in
nine years, but well below the 1970s, when Connecticut scored a 72.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was a good performance. Social health has improved, but not for
everyone," said Marc Miringoff, co-author of the study and director of the
Fordham Institute for Innovation in Social Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Lyons and Senate Minority Leader M. Adela Eads, R-Kent, said they would
review the report to see what changes might be made to the state's health care
plan for poor children, called HUSKY, to get more children enrolled.
</P>
<P>
	   Enrollment figures have not kept up with expectations, and Lyons said the
state may expand the program to children's parents in an effort to improve
families' health.
</P>
<P>
	   Social Services Commissioner Pat Wilson-Coker said she would examine the
figures for racial minorities to see how programs and services might be changed
to better help minority families.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, first released in December, showed that the gap between the rich
and poor continued to grow - to the highest level in the state since 1970,
Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Windham County, the poorest county in the study, per capita personal
income was $23,765 - less than half of the per capita income of Fairfield
County, which was $50,423 in 1997, the report showed.
</P>
<P>
	   The report mirrored a national report released Tuesday by the Economic
Policy Institute that showed that Connecticut's rich got richer over the past 20
years, as the poorest lost ground.
</P>
<P>
	   The poorest fifth of state residents' incomes dipped below $20,000 in the
1990s to about the same levels seen in the 1970s. For the richest fifth of the
state, incomes surged past $170,000 in the 1990s, up from more than $110,000 two
decades before.
</P>
<P>
	   The picture was brighter for infants and teen-agers. The infant mortality
rate has improved from a high of 17.2 deaths per 1,000 births in 1970 to 7.2
deaths in 1997. High school dropout rates, meanwhile, have decreased to the
lowest level since 1973, and teen pregnancies leveled off, after rising in the
late 80s.
</P>
<P>
	   But child abuse has increased steeply over the last 20 years, with about 45
children out of 1,000 referred in child abuse cases in 1997, up from about 10
children per 1,000 in the 70s, the report said. Suicides among people ages 15 to
24 have risen 36 percent over the same time.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of people without health insurance increased, as the amount of
income people spent on health care decreased slightly. Violent crime was down in
Connecticut in 1997, after sharp increases n the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Things got better for workers in Connecticut in recent years, the study
showed. Unemployment is at the lowest level since 1990 and average weekly wages
for factory workers were up in 1997 for the first time in three years. The
report also noted that manufacturing jobs continue to shrink and are being
replaced by lower-paying service jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Housing costs remained high, but have become more affordable in 1997 than in
the late 80s.

<HEADLINE> Whitman signs bill protecting cancer, surgery patients from HMO  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - HMOs and other insurers can no longer force cancer
and surgery patients or pregnant women to switch doctors because of changes in
insurance contracts.
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman signed a law Tuesday to make certain that patients can
stick with the same doctor even if the doctor severs his relationship with an
insurance company during the course of treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   "Patients with major illnesses have had their managed-care providers tell
them they had to change doctors or change health plans. That's not fair," said
Sen. Joseph Vitale, D-Middlesex, a prime sponsor. "People undergoing medical
procedures face enough trauma without having insurers force them to start seeing
a new doctor at a critical time."
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Langevin, director of the New Jersey Association of Health Plans, said
these sorts of sudden changes to patient treatment do not occur now, and the law
will impose needless new regulations on insurers.
</P>
<P>
	   Langevin said state regulations already provide for a four-month grace
period to allow a seamless transition to a new doctor when required. He said the
bill approved Monday changes this grace period to a year.
</P>
<P>
	   He called it unnecessary and said it puts insurers in a bind because they
will be dealing with doctors with whom they no longer have a legal relationship,
depriving them of the means to control treatment, accountability and cost.
</P>
<P>
	   The law bill would also apply to surgery patients who require a period of
post-operative care.
</P>
<P>
	   While the sponsors said this provision is limited to patients with serious
long-term cases, Langevin said it the law would apply to thousands of patients
who have had minor surgeries and have no real need for such continuity.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan Warned To Tone Down  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHY GANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Three U.S. delegations are whirling through
Pakistan this week, all carrying the same message for their host and neighboring
India: ``Turn down the heat.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last month's hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane unleashed a blistering
war of words between the two rival countries -- who also happen to be the
world's newest nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan's military leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has warned India he's not
a man to turn the other cheek to the relentless ``flak from across the border.''
S.K. Singh, a former top official in India's Foreign Ministry, responded that
Musharraf's comment was regarded as ``a threat, which we take very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts fear the verbal sparring could take both countries, which have
fought three wars, back to the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a very real danger of a conflict, because you become the prisoner
of your own rhetoric and you begin a spiral of action and reaction and you end
up doing things you didn't plan to do,'' said Riffat Hussein, a political
analyst at Pakistan's Qaid-e-Azam University.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are in for a period of very high tension,'' said Dr. Tanvir Ahmed at
Pakistan's Institute of Strategic Studies. ``Both countries think they can
manage the tension ... but you never know.''
</P>
<P>
	   That uncertainty explains, in part, the visits to Pakistan by three sets of
high-ranking Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth is to arrive Thursday, the
highest U.S. official to visit since the military threw out the elected
government in October.
</P>
<P>
	   He follows Republican Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas, who followed four Senate
Democrats -- Minority leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, Christopher Dodd of
Connecticut, Harry Reid of Nevada and Daniel Akaka of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott on Tuesday began
two days of meetings in London with India Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The subject is a continuation of the security and nonproliferation
dialogue the United States has been having with India, and reducing tensions
with Pakistan, and other issues of mutual concern on the India subcontinent,''
said U.S. Embassy spokesman Rod Francis.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan's Musharraf was quoted in an Indian newspaper Monday as saying he
suspected India would use the London talks to try to get Pakistan declared a
terrorist state. This week, he was in China, a traditional ally of Pakistan, and
observers in Islamabad said the general would use the visit to strengthen the
alliance against India.
</P>
<P>
	   Brownback likened tensions between Pakistan and India to a slow gas leak
waiting to explode. Given that both countries possess nuclear weapons, he warned
an explosion would be catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
	   India and Pakistan deeply distrust each other and seem to be resisting
efforts to get them to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a total breakdown of communications,'' said Hussein, the
political analyst. ``They are just not on talking terms with each other. This is
unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
	   India has verbally attacked Pakistan relentlessly, accusing its neighbor of
ordering the Dec. 24-31 hijacking in which one passenger was killed. India also
has alleged that all five hijackers were Pakistanis and is seeking to have
Pakistan declared a terrorist state.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan denies involvement in the hijacking and says India is trying to
deflect anger at home because it botched the handling of the hijacking, which
ended with India's release of three pro-Kashmir militants.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan says it will talk to India when New Delhi is ready to discuss
Kashmir, the divided territory claimed by both countries. India says it will
talk to Pakistan when cross-border terrorism ends.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You would not sit down and talk to someone who is sending, daily,
marauders to your homestead, killing your people, making it impossible to live
in peace,'' Singh, the former foreign secretary, said in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
	   In the ongoing tit-for-tat exchanges, Pakistan on Tuesday ordered an Indian
Embassy employee to leave Pakistan within seven days after the man was allegedly
found carrying a bomb.
</P>
<P>
	   The day before, a bomb killed eight people in Karachi, in southern
Pakistan's Sindh province. The provincial governor blamed India, but offered no
evidence to back up the allegation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I see a rough ride ahead,'' Hussein said. ``There is very little meeting
ground between the two countries right now.''

<HEADLINE> Insurers Pay $8.2 Billion in Claims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Property and casualty insurers paid $8.2 billion in claims
in 1999, making the year the fifth most costly in a half century, but still less
expensive than 1998, according to estimates released Tuesday by the Insurance
Services Office Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   May tornadoes in Oklahoma were the costliest of 27 catastrophic events for
the year, and the industry spent an estimated $1.1 billion to settle the
resulting claims.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York-based ISO estimated that insurers spent $10 billion to settle
claims in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The industry's most expensive year since record keeping began in 1949 was
1992, when insurers paid $22.9 billion in claims from 36 catastrophes, including
Hurricane Andrew.
</P>

	   The ISO defines a catastrophe as an event that causes $25 million or more in
insured property losses.

<HEADLINE> Connecticut social index rises to highest point in 9 years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - State leaders say they will use a report on
Connecticut's social well-being to gauge the effectiveness of the state's social
policies and programs.
<P>
	   The 1999 Social State of Connecticut, an annual report on the state's
quality of life, was presented to lawmakers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   It concludes that the state's social health has improved to the highest
level in nine years, but child abuse, health care costs and poverty are stunting
the quality of life for many.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a road map for us. It's a road map of where we're headed and where we
really need to change our course," said House Speaker Moira K. Lyons,
D-Stamford.
</P>
<P>
	   Using figures from 1997, the latest figures available, the report showed
Connecticut has become a better place for workers, young children and people who
live in affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, child abuse and teen suicide increased and more people
said they could not afford rising health care costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the state's social health index was 49 out of 100 - the best in
nine years, but well below the 1970s, when Connecticut scored a 72.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was a good performance. Social health has improved, but not for
everyone," said Marc Miringoff, co-author of the study and director of the
Fordham Institute for Innovation in Social Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Lyons and Senate Minority Leader M. Adela Eads, R-Kent, said they would
review the report to see what changes might be made to the state's health care
plan for poor children, called HUSKY, to get more children enrolled.
</P>
<P>
	   Enrollment figures have not kept up with expectations, and Lyons said the
state may expand the program to children's parents in an effort to improve
families' health.
</P>
<P>
	   Social Services Commissioner Pat Wilson-Coker said she would examine the
figures for racial minorities to see how programs and services might be changed
to better help minority families.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, first released in December, showed that the gap between the rich
and poor continued to grow - to the highest level in the state since 1970,
Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Windham County, the poorest county in the study, per capita personal
income was $23,765 - less than half of the per capita income of Fairfield
County, which was $50,423 in 1997, the report showed.
</P>
<P>
	   The report mirrored a national report released Tuesday by the Economic
Policy Institute that showed that Connecticut's rich got richer over the past 20

state, incomes surged past $170,000 in the 1990s, up from more than $110,000 two
decades before.

rate has improved from a high of 17.2 deaths per 1,000 births in 1970 to 7.2
deaths in 1997. High school dropout rates, meanwhile, have decreased to the
lowest level since 1973, and teen pregnancies leveled off, after rising in the
late 80s.
</P>
<P>
	   But child abuse has increased steeply over the last 20 years, with about 45
children out of 1,000 referred in child abuse cases in 1997, up from about 10
children per 1,000 in the 70s, the report said. Suicides among people ages 15 to

<HEADLINE> Abbott Says Profits Rise  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Abbott Laboratories' fourth quarter profits rose 7 percent,
despite falling drug sales, as the medical products company tried to rebound
after a series of setbacks last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Including profits from its TAP pharmaceutical firm, earnings for the three
months ended Dec. 31 were $922 million, or 43 cents per share, up from $871.7
million, or 40 cents a share from the same period a year ago. Results matched
Wall Street estimates, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, sales for the fourth quarter rose 3.8 percent to $3.5 billion, from
$3.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of hospital products rose 12 percent to $584 million in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   But pharmaceutical sales fell 6 percent in the quarter to $2.44 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, earnings including TAP were $3.4 billion, or $1.57 a share, up
5 percent from $3.24 billion, or $1.50 a share for 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   TAP, which is jointly owned with Takeda Chemical Industries, makes the
popular ulcer drug Prevacid.
</P>
<P>
	   Worldwide sales in 1999 rose 5.3 percent to $13.2 billion, up $12.5 billion
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Abbott shares fell 75 cents to $33.75 on the New York Stock Exchange
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, Abbott was accused by the Food and Drug Administration of quality
control problems in its diagnostics division and was slapped with shareholder
lawsuits after it paid $100 million to settle the case.

<HEADLINE> 3 Named to Counsel Posts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray announced Tuesday he is
appointing two new prosecutors and promoting a lawyer who oversaw a
congressional probe of the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
	   The changes come amid the departures of two deputies who were involved in
the Monica Lewinsky investigation. J. Keith Ausbrook, former chief counsel to
the House subcommittee on national economic growth, natural resources and
regulatory affairs, will be senior counsel to Ray. He went to work for Ray's
predecessor, Ken Starr, last February.
</P>
<P>
	   As chief subcommittee counsel, Ausbrook was instrumental in an investigation
into the transfer of information from a White House database to the Democratic
Party for fund-raising purposes. The subcommittee's final report accused
President Clinton and the White House of theft of government property, an
accusation the administration flatly denied.
</P>
<P>
	   Ray also appointed Brian Stuart Chilton and Julie Thomas as associate
independent counsels. Chilton has practiced with two law firms in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas is a career prosecutor with the U.S. attorney's office in Tampa,
Fla., handling public corruption, narcotics and organized crime cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputies Edward J. Page and Michael Emmick recently left the office. Page is
joining a law firm in Tampa and Emmick is returning to Los Angeles, where he has
been a federal prosecutor for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Two deputies remain with Ray -- W. Hickman Ewing Jr., a former U.S. attorney
in Tennessee who ran Starr's Arkansas investigation for the past five years; and
Jay Apperson, who oversaw the recent prosecutions of former Clinton confidant
Webster Hubbell.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Resigns From Party Post  </HEADLINE>
   By COLLEEN BARRY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Helmut Kohl resigned Tuesday as honorary chairman of the
Christian Democratic Union, brought down by a campaign financing scandal that
now marks the stunning denouement of one of Europe's most respected statesmen
and the man who reunited Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   Defiant to the end, Kohl gave up the influential post rather than capitulate
to demands that he identify donors who made illegal campaign contributions and
help clear up a scandal that threatens to ruin the party.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl's single-handed leadership facilitated Germany's swift reunification in
1990. But he also tolerated no dissent, and finally ceded influence in the party
he tightly controlled during 25 years as chairman after its executive committee
effectively isolated him during an emergency session.
</P>
<P>
	   In an extraordinary step that clearly pained Kohl's successor and protege,
Wolfgang Schaeuble, party leaders earlier Tuesday threatened to suspend Kohl as
honorary chairman until he agreed to cooperate. The post was a rare honor
bestowed when Kohl gave up the party leadership in 1998 after the loss of
national elections to the Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are convinced that Helmut Kohl breaches his duty as honorary chairman
if he refuses to contribute to overcoming the crisis,'' a pale and dejected
Schaeuble told reporters after the emergency session.
</P>
<P>
	   The leaders also demanded Kohl name names to save the party -- something
Kohl flatly refused to do even when fellow conservatives insisted it would end
speculation that anonymous donations were tied to political favors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I cannot bring myself to break the promise I made to several personalities
who financially supported my work in the CDU,'' Kohl said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The decision to resign the honorary chairmanship was not easy for me,'' he
said. ``I have been a Christian Democratic Union member for 50 years. It was and
is my political home.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl, however, retains his seat in parliament, which will make prosecuting
him for irregularities more complicated by requiring a parliament vote to lift
his immunity.
</P>
<P>
	   The resignation ended the power struggle in the party, with Kohl the loser.
Schaeuble said the party had asked him to stay on and clear up the scandal,
despite grumbling by some party members that he, too, was tainted and should
step down.
</P>
<P>
	   The governing Social Democrats and Greens charged that the opposition had
forfeited the chance to deal with the crisis head on.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The decisions of the Christian Democrats have neither cleared up anything
nor led to a self-cleansing,'' said Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said the party was still ``hurtling
downward in an avalanche.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl's defiance -- even after admitting in a television interview last month
that he violated the constitution -- has been increasingly viewed as a liability
to the party as it tries to clear itself of accusations that it broke party
financing laws by keeping donations off the books.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl admitted accepting up to $1 million in unreported campaign funds in the
1990s, when the Christian Democrats led Germany's government.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors in Bonn are investigating whether Kohl should be charged with
breach of trust for financial irregularities. He also is the subject of a
parliamentary inquiry, which officially gets under way Thursday parallel to a
parliamentary debate on the scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   Schaeuble was also under growing pressure in the tangled plot of apparently
illegal cash payments and suspicions of influence peddling after disclosing he
accepted $52,000 from a businessman.
</P>
<P>
	   Admissions and disclosures so far have topped $17 million, including the
damaging revelations Friday by former Interior Minister Manfred Kanther that the
party's Hesse branch channeled $6.8 million in campaign funds through a Swiss
account back into Germany when he was state party chairman. The money was
falsely reported as bequests from abroad between 1989-96.
</P>
<P>
	   Kanther became the first victim of the scandal, announcing Monday he would
resign his seat in parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Other suspicious transactions include a $52,000 cash handover by businessman
Karlheinz Schreiber to Kohl aides in 1991. Schreiber, a central figure in the
scandal, has denied allegations that the money was in return for the Kohl
government's approval of an arms sale to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
	   The donation to Schaeuble also came from Schreiber, who is fighting
extradition from Canada on German tax evasion charges.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the party admitted that $8.9 million in anonymous donations
remain on its Hesse branch's secret Swiss account.

<HEADLINE> Citigroup Profit Up 86 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Citigroup Inc. saw profits soar 86 percent in the fourth
quarter, topping Wall Street's most optimistic estimates. Strong fees from its
investment banking and Citibank helped boost the bottom-line results at the
nation's largest bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Underscoring the role investment banking will play in Citigroup's future,
the company said Tuesday it will spend $2.2 billion to acquire Schroder PLC's
investment banking division in London.
</P>
<P>
	   Citigroup, which owns Salomon Smith Barney, has made a big push in corporate
financial services, including underwriting stocks and bonds and advising
companies on mergers and acquisitions. Salomon Smith Barney was involved in some
of last year's biggest deals, including MCI WorldCom's purchase of Sprint.
</P>
<P>
	   The acquisition of Schroder's London-based investment banking business will
double Salmon Smith Barney's presence in Europe. The new division, which will be
called Schroders Salomon Smith Barney, however, will still pale when compared
with its large U.S. rivals, like Goldman Sachs, which dominate European deals.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is a good base for them to build from," said Diana Yates, an analyst
with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
	   Citigroup signaled that it also plans to expand in the insurance and
brokerage industries in the United States. New legislation signed late last year
eliminated the barriers that separated banks from other financial service
industries.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our exceptionally strong capital position and the successful integration of
our global businesses will enable us to take full advantage of the new financial
modernization legislation in the coming year," the company said in a statement.
"This legislation opens up new horizons for our company and will facilitate our
expansion in the global financial services arena."
</P>
<P>
	   Citigroup's shares dipped 25 cents to $58.75 on the New York Stock Exchange
as investors worried that the Federal Reserve might soon raise interest rates,
which could hurt bank profits.
</P>

	   Citigroup's fourth-quarter profits from operations totaled $2.61 billion, or
75 cents a share, beating the analysts' average estimate of 70 cents a share, as
well as the highest estimate of 73 cents, according to First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   In the fourth quarter of 1998, Citigroup had profits of $1.4 billion, or 40

	   "Across the board everything looked pretty strong," Yates said. "The drivers
being the rebound in their corporate bank, the Salomon Smith Barney investment
bank, and the $2 billion in expenses they have taken out."
</P>
<P>
	   Corporate and investment banking business more than doubled to $1.31 billion

<HEADLINE> For the homeless, cold snap is more bad news  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - The seagulls and the rolling chair operators
had the Boardwalk to themselves.
<P>
	   Beneath the wooden planks on Tuesday, in the place locals call "the
Underwood Motel," Jose Claro, 31, was bundled behind a pair of plastic tarps
suspended from twine he had strung along the underside of the boards to block
the wind.
</P>
<P>
	   "I stay fed," Claro said. "Staying warm is the hard part. I hope it gets
warm soon, but I don't think that's gonna' happen."
</P>
<P>
	   The temperature was 16 degrees.
</P>
<P>
	   Above him, the seagulls patrolled the Boardwalk outside Bally's Park Place
Casino Hotel. There were no french fries to steal. Nobody was eating on the
Boardwalk. Too cold. The few hardy souls who had to be out scurried from casino
to casino.
</P>
<P>
	   Rolling chair operators sat forlornly, awaiting riders who never came.
"People are just staying inside," grumbled Pat Grzeskiewicz, 47, who sat outside
Trump Plaza in his chair, reading the comics, a cigarette in one hand.
</P>
<P>
	   For Claro, there was no inside to stay in. He pulled a ratty knit
Philadelphia Eagles cap over his ears, took a swig from a pint bottle of vodka,
then wiped his nose. What he missed froze in his moustache.
</P>
<P>
	   How long has he been here? "I don't remember. Six months. A year."
</P>
<P>
	   How does he eat? "I go to the (Atlantic City Rescue) Mission, (or) to Sister
Jean," he says. That's Jean Webster, the former casino cook who runs a soup
kitchen out of First Presbyterian Church.
</P>
<P>
	   How does he sleep in such cold? "I have some blankets I got from the
Mission. I'm alive."
</P>
<P>
	   He paused for a minute, looking around him at empty potato chip bags, an
empty bottle of Gilbey's Gin, hunks of cardboard and a bench fashioned from a
6-foot piece of wood placed over three milk crates.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is my living room, right here where you're sitting," he tells his
visitor. "It's hard knocks life for me right now. A lot of hardship."
</P>
<P>
	   These are the kind of people William Southrey worries about. "This is
life-threatening cold," said Southrey, president of the Atlantic City Rescue
Mission shelter.
</P>
<P>
	   Every day during the cold snap, Southrey or his chaplains have gone out
looking for homeless people. They check under the Boardwalk. They check
abandoned buildings. They urge anyone they find to come to the Mission for a hot
meal.
</P>
<P>
	   The shelter is overflowing, but no one gets turned away. On Monday night,
there were 217 people - about 50 more than normal.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very busy here right now," he said Tuesday. "All the beds are filled.
We put mats down on the floors in the day room and the dining room. They're all
full, too."
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout New Jersey, the deep freeze continued Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
	   -Readings of 5 below zero in Charlotteburg, 4 below in Wantage and 1 below
in Sussex were among the lowest temperatures recorded in the state, according to
the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
	   -Testing equipment at automobile inspection stations froze, forcing at least
six of them to turn away motorists for all or part of the day. Most of the
problems occurred with dynamometers, the new equipment that simulates driving
conditions to check auto emissions.
</P>
<P>
	   -In Newark, firefighters doused hot spots that flared up a day after a
factory fire destroyed an entire city block, leaving dozens homeless and coating
streets and power lines with ice. No injuries were reported in the fire at
Mercury Candle Co., but a guard dog was missing and feared dead.
</P>
<P>
	   -In Pomona, work crews were investigating whether the cold was to blame for
a power outage that caused runway lights at Atlantic City International Airport
to go dark for about two hours Monday night. Four incoming Spirit Airlines
flights had to be diverted - two to Philadelphia, two to Norfolk, Va. - as a
result, said airport director Tom Rafter. A regulator that controls one of the
lighting circuits malfunctioned, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't know for sure if the weather had anything to do with it. We've
located the problem area but now we have to figure out what went wrong," he said
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Judge denies request for two trials for brothers accused in witness  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - A judge Tuesday denied a motion to grant a
separate trial for a man accused along with his brother in the killing of an
8-year-old boy who was scheduled to testify against him in an earlier murder.
<P>
	   Russell Peeler Jr., 27, had asked that his trial be severed from the trial
of his brother, Adrian Peeler, 24. Both brothers face the possibility of the
death penalty in the Jan. 7, 1999, killings of 8-year-old Leroy "B.J." Brown Jr.
and his mother, Karen Clarke.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege that Russell Peeler arranged for his brother, Adrian, to
kill the mother and son to silence B.J., who was expected to be the
prosecution's key witness in the 1998 slaying of Clarke's boyfriend, Rudolph
Snead Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   In arguing for separate trials for the brothers, Russell Peeler's lawyer,
John Walkley, said the two have "antagonistic" defenses that should be heard
separately by two different juries.
</P>
<P>
	   Walkley would not elaborate. At Walkley's request, Superior Court Judge G.
Sarsfield Ford agreed to seal from public view a memorandum containing details
on the separate defenses each of the Peeler brothers plans to use.
</P>
<P>
	   But prosecutor Jonathan Benedict, in arguing against separate trials, said
that Adrian Peeler plans to claim that Gary Garner, the driver of the getaway
car, did the killings. Benedict said Russell Peeler will claim "he had nothing
to do with anything."
</P>
<P>
	   "They're basically saying the same thing. They are not mutually exclusive
defenses," Benedict said.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, Garner was charged with conspiracy to commit murder. His arrest
came as the state's key witness in the slayings, Josephine Lee, was testifying
behind closed doors and implicating Garner in the crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said Lee told them Garner drove Adrian Peeler to Clarke's home and
waited as Peeler went inside and killed the mother and son. Lee said Garner then
drove Peeler to a Milford motel.
</P>
<P>
	   Garner is expected to testify against the Peeler brothers. His name appears
on the prosecution's witness list.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, who lived across the street from Clarke, is expected to be the state's
star witness. In a plea bargain, she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit
murder. She told police she alerted the Peeler brothers when Clarke and her son
arrived home after grocery shopping, then knocked on Clarke's door and watched
as Adrian Peeler shot the mother and son to death.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense has asked that the brothers' trial be moved out of Bridgeport
because of extensive media coverage. But Judge G. Sarsfield Ford said he would
reserve decision on the request, at least until an attempt is made to pick a
jury in Bridgeport. Since jury selection began on Jan. 6, just two jurors have
been chosen.
</P>
<P>
	   Walkley said after the hearing that he asked for his memo to be sealed
because it contains "sensitive information" about the defense that could make it
even more difficult to pick a jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege that Russell Peeler targeted B.J. Brown after he learned
the boy was going to testify against him in the killing of Snead. A year before
Snead was fatally shot in a Bridgeport barber shop, B.J. was a passenger in a
car driven by Snead that was fired on by another car. The boy later identified
the shooter as Russell Peeler.

<HEADLINE> Reuters' Employees Call in Sick  </HEADLINE>
    By SETH SUTEL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Most journalists in the New York office of Reuters, a major
financial news provider, called in sick Tuesday amid drawn-out negotiations with
the company over job security.
</P>
<P>
	   The protest came just as major U.S. companies began reporting earnings for
the fourth quarter of 1999, an especially busy time for business news companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Reuters spokesman Bob Crooke said all but 30 of the company's 120
journalists in New York called in sick Tuesday. He said he was unsure how long
the action would continue.
</P>
<P>
	   Crooke said the company was still putting out a "reasonable file, under the
circumstances," with management personnel working with the remaining employees
to write stories.
</P>
<P>
	   The Newspaper Guild in New York, which represents the employees, did not
authorize the action, guild president Barry Lipton said. But Lipton said
tensions have been rising in the ranks as the talks have dragged on for more
than two years.
</P>
<P>
	   "Management is trying to decimate job security provisions," Lipton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The talks have been ongoing since 1997, and the contract under which the
journalists had been working expired in February 1998, Crooke said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reuters is seeking more flexibility in handling layoffs and how its staff is
deployed, Crooke said. "The guild is resisting this and is insisting on
something that I can only describe as lifetime tenure for all staff, which is
just not realistic in today's market," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Representatives for the union and Reuters management were scheduled to meet
again Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Other news organizations have also had labor flare-ups recently. Some
writers for The Associated Press withheld bylines for 10 days over the New
Year's holiday to protest company proposals over pay and benefits. The company
and its union are in negotiations for a new contract to replace one that expired
Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   Last summer, writers and editors at The Wall Street Journal protested
proposals from Dow Jones &AMP; Co. over retirement benefits. The two sides reached
agreement in October on a new three-year contract.

<HEADLINE> 'Millionaire' Carries ABC to Win  </HEADLINE>
    By FRAZIER MOORE AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC must be feeling like a million bucks, and then some.
</P>
<P>
	   Its smash-hit "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" helped carry the network to a
prime-time television ratings win last week, as the game show's seven nightly
airings all landed in the Top 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's broadcast nabbed the top spot with an extraordinary 20.6
household rating and 32 share, according to Nielsen Media Research figures, for
the largest audience of any program thus far in the 1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
	   It was ABC's best week since November 1995, the network said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   For the week of Jan. 10-16, ABC won with an average 17.60 million viewers
(11.2 household rating, 18 share), while CBS was second with 13.29 million
viewers (9.0 rating, 14 share) and NBC averaged 12.04 million viewers (8.3
rating, 13 share). Fox had 9.74 million viewers (6.2 rating, 10 share).
</P>
<P>
	   Among the emerging networks, UPN had 3.94 million viewers (2.6 rating, 4
share), while the WB had 3.22 million viewers (2.3 rating, 4 share). The Pax
network had 0.93 million viewers (0.7 rating, 1 share).
</P>
<P>
	   In the evening news wars, "NBC Nightly News" was the frontrunner with a
total of 11.79 million viewers (8.7 rating, 17 share), while ABC's "World News
Tonight" totaled 11.69 million (8.5 rating, 16 share) and "CBS Evening News" had
10.21 million (7.5 rating, 14 share).
</P>
<P>
	   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of the nation's
estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the percentage of in-use
televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
	   For the week of Jan. 10-16, the top 10 shows, their networks and ratings
were: "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" (Wednesday), ABC, 20.6; "E.R.," NBC, 18.8;
"Who Wants to be a Millionaire" (Tuesday), ABC, 18.1; "Who Wants to be a
Millionaire" (Thursday), ABC, 17.8; "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" (Sunday),
ABC, 16.5; "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" (Monday), ABC, 16.3; "Who Wants to be
a Millionaire" (Friday), ABC, 15.8; "Friends," NBC, 15.1; "Who Wants to be a
Millionaire" (Saturday), ABC, 14.1; "60 Minutes," CBS, 13.7.

<HEADLINE> Report: VA Office Operates in Chaos  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY MARGASAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government office handling congressional inquiries on
behalf of veterans operated ``in an atmosphere of total chaos'' and often didn't
respond to lawmakers for months, the Veterans Affairs Department's inspector
general reports.
</P>
<P>
	   The blistering audit blames the former Office of Congressional Affairs
director, Sheila Clarke McCready, for causing a ``high degree of mistrust''
among the staff and doling out improper raises to consultants who were empowered
to make management decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. McCready, who earns $130,200 a year, was transferred from the Office of
Congressional Affairs but still holds a management position as a special
assistant to the department's undersecretary for health.
</P>
<P>
	   She did not respond to messages seeking comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
	   The congressional affairs office links the department to Americans who
contact their home state lawmakers about veterans benefits and the condition of
the health care system.
</P>
<P>
	   John Hanson, a spokesman for the department, said the congressional affairs
office receives 30 to 50 inquiries a week from members of Congress and their
staff with questions such as whether a hospital is going to close, how a
constituent can get a job with the Veterans department, or complaints about long
waits to see a doctor.
</P>
<P>
	   But Hanson said he was ``absolutely confident'' that there were no delays
for inquiries involving the delivery of any individual's benefits, saying those
were handled by a special unit, based in the Capitol complex, that was not part
of the problems cited in the report.
</P>
<P>
	   The Veterans Affairs Department provides health benefits to 3.6 million
veterans a year and cash benefits to 3.3 million veterans or their survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The impact of the workload delays has resulted in what both (Office of
Congressional Affairs) managers and staff claimed was an atmosphere of total
chaos or crisis management,'' concluded the report.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, written early this month, said the office lagged so far behind
in responding to congressional inquiries that staff members produced four
examples of documents that were backdated ``to hide ... processing delays.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Veterans Affairs has been the subject of several critical
studies during the past year, and VA Secretary Togo West Jr. has announced he
will leave before the Clinton administration ends.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional investigators previously found that the department was wasting
up to $1 million a day on unneeded medical facilities, used $61 million in
travel funds for salaries and equipment and allowed some top administrators to
approve their own expenses.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspector general previously reported that West violated government
regulations and cost taxpayers thousands of dollars by using military aircraft
for two trips to Louisiana and Alaska in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest report, the inspector general accused Ms. McCready of
``berating'' the permanent workforce.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspector general found:
</P>
<P>
	   --The office overspent its fiscal 1999 annual budget of $2.3 million by
nearly $390,000 because of uncontrolled salary increases, excessive overtime
costs and the hiring of consultants and temporary employees.
</P>
<P>
	   --Certain staff members in the office ``were being afforded preferential
treatment for earning overtime'' and complaints of favoritism towards
consultants over permanent staff ``were substantiated.''
</P>
<P>
	   --The spending of $143,000 to hire consultants in fiscal 1999 was
``excessive and inappropriate'' because they were performing government work,
even making key decisions such as approving leave.
</P>
<P>
	   --Ms. McCready made four ``inappropriate purchases'' on her government
travel card and a consultant made another 17.
</P>
<P>
	   The VA's assistant secretary for planning and analysis, Dennis Duffy,
responded in the report that VA officials will recommend appropriate action
relating to Ms. McCready's performance. The office's new leadership will
complete a reassessment of the congressional operation by March 1, Duffy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Consultants' contracts were canceled effective last Nov. 20 and future
consultant hiring will be limited, he promised.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said Ms. McCready delayed a VA career staff's promotion due to
budgetary constraints while increasing a consultant's salary by $21,000
annually, and hiring two other consultants and extending a temporary employee's
appointment.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the report, in another case, she converted a staff position to
a consultant's post in order to provide a $10,105 pay raise, an effort to
circumvent a finding that the position could not be justified at a higher pay
level. After the conversion, the consultant approved employee leave, a function
reserved for government employees, the report said..

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Seek More Base Closings  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration's 2001 budget proposal will
ask Congress for authority to close more military bases, starting in 2003,
Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre said Tuesday
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers are seen as unlikely to go along in an election year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to ask for permission to do base closures again,'' Hamre said
in an interview. ``We still have excess infrastructure, ... and right now the
best process, the most fair process is the base closure process.''
</P>
<P>
	   In each of the past three years Defense Secretary William Cohen pressed for
more base closings and each time Congress said no. Last year Cohen proposed
separate rounds of base closings in 2001 and 2005. The administration will
submit its 2001 budget proposal in early February.
</P>
<P>
	   Many in Congress are unwilling to open the possibility of bases being closed
in their states, fearing a backlash at the ballot box from voters who believe a
lost military base means lost economic opportunity. Cohen has failed to persuade
Congress that communities can benefit from the loss of a base, despite examples
of communities adding to their tax base by converting old bases to private use.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamre said this is a particularly opportune time to make such transitions,
since the national economy is so strong.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration has not said how many bases it thinks should be closed,
nor which woud be targeted. That would be decided by a congressionally
authorized Base Realignment and Closure Commission, subject to presidential
approval. The Pentagon lacks the authority to close bases on its own.
</P>
<P>
	   The last round of base closings was approved by the president and Congress
in 1995. In all, the independent commission created by Congress recommended
closing 79 domestic bases and realigning 26 others, for anticipated savings of
$19.3 billion over 20 years. In the previous three closure rounds in 1988, 1991
and 1993, the military was ordered to close 250 bases and realign 152 others.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of his effort to get Congress behind further rounds of base
closings, Cohen has said he is bothered that communities face unnecessary
bureaucratic obstacles in making the transition to private use of a closed base.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The closure process is still too complicated,'' he said last spring,
referring to lengthy delays in the cleanup and transfer of base properties. To
address the problem, Cohen created ``special re-use teams'' of senior military
and civilian officials to cut through the red tape and help speed up property
transfers.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen contends that failure to close antiquated bases -- many of them Cold
War relics -- could cost the Pentagon $20 billion that would be better spent on
ships, jet fighters and other crucial military equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   In his remarks Tuesday, Hamre noted that many Republicans believe Clinton
poisoned the process in 1995 in an effort to save jobs at McClellan Air Force
Base in Sacramento, Calif., and Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas.,
both of which were targets of the 1995 round.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The primary argument we've confronted is that the base closure process was
corrupted in the last round, and we're saying, `Look, there will be a whole new
(administration) that will come in and do base closures,'' Hamre said. ``There's
no way that politics will get into it,'' since it would not start until after
the 2000 election.

	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.81 to 513.43.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq rallied today following the merger of JDS Uniphase and E-Tek
Dynamics, two companies that make components used in optical networking. JDS
Uniphase offered $15 billion, or about $211 per share, for E-Tek. Today, E-Tek
soared, while JDS Uniphase ended slightly higher.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft, which was releasing its earnings after the close of trading, rose
as investors anticipated a strong report.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq's rally was a return to form for the index that soared 86 percent
in 1999 on the strength of large, well-established technology companies, from
network providers like Cisco Systems to software leaders like Microsoft. Jeffrey
Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers, said today those
stocks are likely to lead the market in 2000 as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no question these stocks are expensive, but we believe it's
deservedly so," he said. "They have the best fundamentals."
</P>
<P>
	   Several Fortune 500 companies today reported stronger than expected
fourth-quarter earnings, including pharmaceutical firm Pfizer and financial
services companies Citigroup and PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite their strong profit reports, Pfizer and Citigroup finished with
slight losses, while PaineWebber rose only modestly.
</P>
<P>
	   Many investors were distracted by concerns about interest rates. The yield
on the Treasury's 30-year bond was up to 6.74 percent today from late Friday's
6.69 percent, reaching levels not seen since July 1997. The financial markets
were closed Monday for the holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts expect the Federal Reserve to boost interest rates a quarter
percentage point when it meets Feb. 1-2. The Fed's three rate hikes last year
did little to slow the economy, and the central bank is expected to raise rates
again this year to prevent inflation from accelerating.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial companies, which are most sensitive to interest rate changes, were
mostly lower. American Express and General Electric, which has a large finance
business in its GE Capital unit, led the Dow lower.
</P>
<P>
	   Pharmaceutical concerns, which have rallied so far this year, slumped
following Monday's announcement of the planned merger of British drugmakers
SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo Wellcome. SmithKline's and Glaxo's U.S. shares
dropped 5 to 55.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said some selling of blue chip stocks was to be expected after the
Dow rose 200 points Friday for its first finish about 11,700.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a pause to refresh, and I would use it as a buying opportunity,"
said Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc.
in St. Louis.

<HEADLINE> Albright Backs Economic Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
   By ROB MAADDI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In an editorial published Tuesday in a medical journal,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright defended the effects of economic embargoes
on public health.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of U.S. foreign policy charge that the sanctions punish the Iraqi
and Cuban people and are not a morally acceptable tool of diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright expressed total support for the Clinton administration's sanctions
against Iraq and Cuba to thwart the building of weapons of mass destruction by
Saddam Hussein and to push Fidel Castro toward democrachy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There would be no better route to greater prosperity and improved public
health in Cuba than a government that was accountable to its people,'' Albright
said in the Annals of Internal Medicine, published in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   As for Saddam, ``there is no greater enemy to public health in Iraq than
he,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright said Saddam is not using the available resources for the intended
purposes. She said the United Nations reported the Iraqi government spent only
$9.5 million of the $25 million set aside for nutrition supplies for vulnerable
children, pregnant women and nursing mothers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Joseph A. Fiorenza, president of the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, said the sanctions against Iraq ``have long ceased to be a
morally acceptable tool of diplomacy.'' The bishops have also said that the
American embargo of Cuba deprives the neediest people of essential foods and
medicines.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Wants Tests on OTC Drug Role  </HEADLINE>
   By DEB RIECHMANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prescription painkillers and over-the-counter cold pills
can cause drowsiness in even the safest drivers. To help save lives, federal
safety officials want new tests done to find out what role these medications
play in fatal truck, train, bus and boat accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   Pilots killed in plane crashes already are routinely tested for commonly
prescribed drugs and drugstore remedies. Now, the NSTB wants similar testing
done for other means of travel. And the board wants the Transportation
Department to produce a list of pills people can safely pop when operating large
trucks on the freeways, freight and passenger trains, boats and buses traveling
in and out of town.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Since 1987, the safety board has investigated over 100 accidents in all
modes of passenger transportation that involved prescription or over-the-counter
medications whose effects could potentially impair the vehicle's operator,'' the
NTSB said in issuing its safety recommendation.
</P>
<P>
	   That happened June 20, 1998, when a bus traveling along the Pennsylvania
Turnpike hit a parked tractor-trailer. Seven people died and 18 were injured.
The alertness of the driver was hampered by an antihistamine he was taking to
fight a chronic sinus problems, the safety board said in citing causes of the
crash.
</P>
<P>
	   In aviation, prescription and over-the-counter drugs contributed to 84 of
4,840 -- about 2 percent -- fatal plane accidents that occurred between 1987 and
1996, the board said. More than 120 people died in these plane accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   One on Feb. 4, 1995, involved a Cessna 150 that crashed into a tree near
Arnaudville, La., slid into water and sank. The safety board cited the pilot's
use of Valium, a tranquilizer and muscle relaxant, as a factor in the crash that
killed the pilot and injured a passenger.
</P>
<P>
	   The safety board's recommendation does not include automobiles. But the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that 100,000 crashes --
about 3 percent to 4 percent of motor vehicle accidents -- occur each year as a
result of drivers falling asleep behind the wheel. While not directly linked to
prescription or over-the-counter drugs, NHTSA says the accidents, which involve
motorcycles to 18-wheelers, cause 76,000 injuries and 1,500 deaths each year.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the Transportation Department, who declined to be
identified, said the department and its agencies that regulate trucks, buses,
trains and boats, are reviewing the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The department is concerned about the potential side effects of
prescription and nonprescription medications used in transportation
operations,'' the spokesman said. He said the department has initiated
informational campaigns on the problem and already does extensive tests for
illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators of most surface transportation accidents gather information on
vehicle operators' use of five classes of drugs -- marijuana, cocaine, opiates,
amphetamines and phencyclidine, or PCP -- identified in Transportation
Department regulations. The Federal Railway Administration also tests for
barbiturates and benzodiazepines, which includes Valium.
</P>
<P>
	   But little data is collected on the role prescription drugs, such as
antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications, and over-the-counter drugs,
including antihistamines, play in these accidents. This prompted the board to
recommend that the Transportation Department establish requirements for doing
toxicological tests on a representative sample of operators involved in fatal
highway, railroad, bus and marine accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   The NTSB's safety recommendation also asks the Food and Drug Administration
to develop easy-to-recognize warnings for prescription or over-the-counter drugs
that can specifically interfere with a person's ability to drive. In Sweden,
such drugs are labeled with a warning triangle, the board said, and pharmacists
in Australia often voluntarily affix a red triangle even though it's not
required under the law.
</P>
<P>
	   In March, FDA regulations took effect requiring consumer-friendly labels
that provide instructions in large print and highlight proper dosages and safety
warnings. The FDA will review the NTSB recommendation as it works on future
labeling policies, spokeswoman Susan Cruzan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA already includes warnings about operating vehicles in labeling it
approves for new prescription drugs, she said. ``It's up to the pharmacist to
provide the information to the consumer,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 162.26  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks drove the Nasdaq composite index
tantalizingly close to a new closing high Tuesday, while blue-chip shares
tumbled as worries about rising interest rates distracted investors from strong
fourth-quarter corporate earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 162.26 to close at 11,560.72.
Profit-taking after a Dow rally last week also contributed to some selling.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq rose 66.54 to 4,130.81, just shy of its Jan. 3 closing record of
4,131.15. The Nasdaq has now gone through 10 straight sessions without setting a
new record, the longest streak since late October, when the technology-dominated
index began a sprint that lasted through the start of the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 10.01 to
1,455.14.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq rallied following news of the merger of JDS Uniphase and E-Tek
Dynamics, two companies that make components used in optical networking. JDS
Uniphase offered $15 billion, or about $211 per share, for E-Tek, helping shares
of E-Tek soar 42 1/2 to 178 3/8. JDS Uniphase ended up 3 1/2 at 195 11/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft, which released its earnings after the close of Wall Street's
regular trading session, rose 3 1/16 to 115 3/16 as investors anticipated a
strong report. In extended-hours trading, Microsoft slipped back to 113 1/4
after the company reported profits that beat official estimates, but missed the
most optimistic projections circulating among Wall Street traders.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't clear how the software maker's results would affect the market on
Wednesday. While Microsoft did decline in late trading, most traders had left
for the day when its earnings were announced.

<P>
	   The Nasdaq rally was a return to form for the index that soared 86 percent
in 1999 on the strength of large, well-established technology companies, from
network providers like Cisco Systems to software leaders like Microsoft. At the
start of 2000, a bout of profit-taking knocked the index nearly 10 percent below
its peak.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, however, the Nasdaq resumed its trek toward a new record as
investors proved unwilling to abandon technology stocks. Jeffrey Applegate,
chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers, said he expects many of the
large-capitalization technology leaders that led the market in 1999 to dominate
2000 as well.

<HEADLINE> El Paso Energy To Buy Coastal Corp.  </HEADLINE>
    By MARK BABINECK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOUSTON (AP) -- El Paso Energy Corp. is buying rival Coastal Corp. for about
$10 billion in stock, solidifying El Paso's status as one of the nation's
leading natural gas companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal announced Tuesday would create a Houston-based firm with more than
$18 billion in annual revenues. The two companies combined have 18,000 employees
worldwide, though officials said there will be an undetermined number of job
cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   The boards of both Houston companies already have approved the transaction,
which includes El Paso Energy's assumption of $6 billion of Coastal debt.
Pending regulatory and shareholder approval, the deal is expected to close by
year end.
</P>
<P>
	   "With this merger, El Paso Energy will become the only company that is one
of the top five in every sector of the wholesale natural gas and power arena,"
said William A. Wise, president and chief executive officer of El Paso Energy.
</P>
<P>
	   Wise will lead the combined company.
</P>
<P>
	   El Paso Energy already owns a coast-to-coast natural gas pipeline. Coastal
is engaged in natural gas gathering, transport and marketing as well as oil
refining, chemicals and mining.
</P>
<P>
	   Wise said the addition of Coastal's assets will help the company develop a
telecommunications network over its 58,000 miles of interstate natural gas
pipelines in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be a tremendous path for data, voice and telephone," Wise said.
"This expands our footprint to 70 to 75 percent of the country."
</P>
<P>
	   Under the terms of the agreement, each share of Coastal will be exchanged
for 1.23 shares of El Paso Energy. At Friday's closing prices, the deal values
each share of Coastal at about $45.66 -- about a 27 percent premium for Coastal
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
	   Since spinning off from Burlington Resources in 1992, El Paso has grown
considerably through acquisitions. It acquired Tenneco Inc.'s pipeline business
in 1996 for $4 billion and last year acquired Sonat Inc. for $6 billion in stock
and assumed debt.
</P>
<P>
	   At 5:15 p.m. EST on the New York Stock Exchange, El Paso Energy shares were
down $2.12 1/2 to $35, and Coastal shares closed up $3 at $39.

<HEADLINE> Body found in Allegheny River  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   REESEDALE, Pa. (AP) - Search crews Tuesday found the body of a diver who
was lost last week as he inspected underwater seals at a private dam on the
Allegheny River in northwestern Pennsylvania last week.
<P>
	   The body of Todd Washburn, 33, of Trenton, N.J., was found Tuesday
afternoon, according to his employer, Marion Hill Associates.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong County Coroner Robert Bower said Washburn was found by a co-worker
in 20 feet of water just downstream from the Piney Hydroelectric Station about
40 miles northeast of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
	   Washburn's oxygen lines became tangled as he was diving Thursday near the
small town of Reesedale. The dam is owned by Sithe Energies Inc. of New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said Washburn's air lines broke, and the crew on the surface
lost radio contact with him.
</P>
<P>
	   The flow of the river was reduced at upstream dams by 90 percent Monday to
make the search easier.
</P>
<P>
	   The Occupational Health and Safety Administration was investigating the
accident.
</P>
<P>
	   Washburn's address was previously reported by police as New Philadelphia,
Schuykill County. Jeff Pelkowski, a spokesman for Marion Hill, said Washburn
recently moved but had not updated his driver's license.

<HEADLINE> Heating Oil at 9-yr High; Gold Up  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The arctic cold wave that blasted the eastern United States spurred a big
jump in natural gas and heating oil futures Tuesday, and oil prices forged to a
nine-year high for the second time in as many trading days.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, gold made its biggest one-day gain since early December
and cocoa sank.
</P>
<P>
	   Heating oil roared to its own nine-year high after sub-zero temperatures
swept across New England and much of the Eastern seaboard reached for the
thermostat to crank up the heat in the face of nasty January weather.
</P>
<P>
	   With frigid weather driving demand to its highest point of the new year, the
price of heating oil rose nearly 5 percent on the New York Mercantile Exchange
and natural gas surged 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, oil prices were off on their latest tear after a signal by a top
official of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that its
10-month-old production cutbacks could last through 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Venezuela's oil minister, Ali Rodriguez, suggested that OPEC could extend
the 4.3-million-barrel-a-day cutbacks for the rest of the year "if market
conditions warrant it." The decision will be made at the cartel's March 27
meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Also contributing to crude's 2 percent jump was a refinery problem in
Venezuela that forced the state oil firm to declare force majeure on gasoline
exports.
</P>
<P>
	   Combined, those factors left oil just one strong day away from the lofty
$30-a-barrel mark.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just a bull market -- that's kind of it in a nutshell," said Bill
O'Grady, energy analyst for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're getting a lot of people piling into this thing because it looks like
it's going to go higher. Everything coming out of OPEC supports that."
</P>
<P>
	   Intermediate crude for February delivery settled up 83 cents at $28.85 a
barrel, the highest since late 1990, after reaching $29 in intraday trading.
</P>
<P>
	   February heating oil leaped 3.23 cents to 77.04 cents a gallon; February
unleaded gas rose 2.68 cents to 77.20 cents a gallon; February natural gas
jumped 6.1 cents to $2.383 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
	   In London, North Sea Brent for March delivery rose 40 cents to $26.05 a
barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Since peaking at $339 an ounce on Oct. 5, gold has plummeted all the way to
the low $280s. But a nearly 2 percent jump Tuesday sent the February contract
back to $289.90 on the Comex division of the New York Merc -- up $4.70 for the
day.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no clearcut news development to drive the buying. Some analysts
said traders might be positioning themselves ahead of a gold auction next week
in Britain that could set a new price level.
</P>
<P>
	   Cocoa prices are under pressure from a heavy crop now being shipped from
ports in the Ivory Coast and Ghana, the world's top two producers.
</P>
<P>
	   March cocoa fell $22 to $828 per ton.

<HEADLINE> Bank of America Earnings Rise  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL NOWELL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLOTTE (AP) -- Bank of America's fourth-quarter profits jumped 32 percent
as big customer fees helped the nation's second-largest bank meet Wall Street's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   BankAmerica earned $2.12 billion, or $1.23 a share, up from $1.6 billion, or
91 cents a share, in the last quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The Charlotte-based bank recorded a $213 million after-tax charge to cover
costs associated with the merger of NationsBank and BankAmerica in the latest
quarter, compared with a $441 million after-tax charge a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, fourth-quarter net income was $1.90 billion, or $1.10 a share,
compared to $1.16 billion, or 66 cents a share a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   "(The year) 1999 was a significant step in the right direction," Hugh L.
McColl Jr., Bank of America chairman and chief executive officer, said in a
statement. "We delivered above-average earnings growth and either met or made
progress toward our other financial targets.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our merger transition effort could not have gone more smoothly," he said.
"We ended the year having consolidated all of our business lines, expanded our
investment banking platform, and made substantial progress in our
relationship-based strategies."
</P>
<P>
	   For the quarter, revenue rose 11 percent to $8.14 billion from $7.3 billion,
paced by significant improvements in every fee-based business, especially
investment banking, trading, mortgage banking and credit card income, the bank
said. Meanwhile, expenses were lower.
</P>
<P>
	   But investors appeared more concerned that the Federal Reserve may soon
raise interest rates, which would hurt bank profits. BankAmerica's stock fell
almost 5 percent, or by $2.50, to $48 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Bank of America's operating earnings rose 27 percent to $8.24
billion, or $4.68 a share, up from $6.49 billion, or $3.64 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Including merger-related charges, net income in 1999 was up 53 percent to
$7.88 billion, or $4.48 per share, compared to $5.17 billion, or $2.90 per
share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank benefitted from a 6 percent increase in revenue, $32.52 billion vs.
$30.65 billion, combined with a 4 percent reduction in expenses.
</P>
<P>
	   With $633 billion in assets, Bank of America serves more than 30 million
households and 2 million businesses.

economically destitute, politically isolated and militarily hostile -- that
Clinton administration officials say poses the most immediate missile threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Thus the initial version of a national missile defense, as envisioned by
Pentagon planners, would be designed mainly to counter a small-scale attack from
North Korea. More robust defenses might be added later to shield American
territory from missile attacks by other so-called rogue nations, such as Iraq or
Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton may decide as early as this summer whether to proceed with
a national missile defense, which the Pentagon estimates will cost at least
$12.7 billion over the next five years. It could be ready for use by 2005,
although many officials involved in the program believe that may be too
ambitious.
</P>
<P>
	   An important test of the missile interceptor -- the centerpiece of a U.S.
defense system -- was set for Tuesday night. The interceptor was to be launched
from a U.S. Army missile range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific Ocean in an
attempt to shoot down a mock warhead carried into space atop a converted
Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile launched from Vandenberg Air
Force Base, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   If the interceptor, called a ``kill vehicle,'' succeeded in hitting the
target warhead -- and if all of the radar, communications and other technical
aspects of the test worked correctly -- then the Pentagon would have met its
self-defined minimum standard for recommending that the system is feasible to
deploy, spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. An initial test last October resulted in a
successful intercept.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we just have to wait until all the results are in and see how they
mesh together before we can say it's a successful integrated systems test,''
Bacon told reporters before the scheduled start of the test.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia is concerned that a U.S. missile defense system would undermine the
deterrent value of its nuclear missile arsenal, as is China.
</P>
<P>
	   John Hamre, the deputy U.S. defense secretary, said Tuesday that Russia and
China need not worry about the U.S. system, which would be designed to counter
limited missile attacks from ``rogue'' countries like North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview in his Pentagon office, Hamre said North Korea is a
legitimate source of worry about a surprise missile attack, since it has
invested heavily in developing a long-range missile capability, even though no
one is threatening it and even while many of its people are starving.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no rational reason why North Korea, with the economic straits
that they are in, would choose such a provocative thing to do,'' Hamre said.
``This is a country that doesn't care about the opinion of the international
community,'' and therefore must be judged capable of attacking the United States
unprovoked.

<HEADLINE> Italy Pol Found Guilty in Hash Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- The founder of Italy's Radical Party was convicted for the
second time Tuesday of handing out free hashish.
</P>
<P>
	   Marco Pannella was ordered to pay a $3,700 fine and given a suspended
sentence of two months and 20 days.
</P>
<P>
	   The case dated to December 1995, when he handed out about 3 grams of hashish
to crowds in Rome's central Piazza Navona. Pannella has long crusaded for the
legalization of hashish and marijuana, contending it would cripple the Mafia's
lucrative drug-dealing business.
</P>
<P>
	   Three years ago, Pannella was handed a four-month suspended sentence for
distributing free hashish and marijuana at a Roman flea market in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's conviction comes as Italy's center-left government bickers over a
proposal to legalize hashish and marijuana presented by the largest party in the
coalition, the Democratic Left. Conservative leaders have denounced the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Pannella's past campaigns, which include hunger strikes and the distribution
of money, have helped push through referendums legalizing divorce and abortion.

<P>
	   REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Second-quarter profits at Microsoft Corp.
soared 22 percent, helped by strong demand in Asia and sales of the
latest version of its Office business software. Microsoft said
today that it netted $2.44 billion or 44 cents a diluted share in
profits, up from $1.98 billion or 40 cents a share a year ago. The
company had $6.11 billion in revenue for the quarter ending Dec.
31, an 18 percent increase over the $5.2 billion for the same
quarter last year, it announced today. ``We are very pleased with
this quarter's results, which came in as expected reflecting solid
customer demand from around the world, particularly in Asia,'' said
John Conners, the new chief financial officer at Microsoft.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Paine Webber Group Inc., the fourth-largest U.S.
brokerage firm, reported today that its profits rose in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier. But the October-December figure was
reduced by the $60 million buyback of preferred stock from the GE
Capital Corp. Earnings, after taking the buyback into account, were
$101.5 million, or 67 cents a share, compared with $94.5 million,
or 63 cents a share in the same period a year ago. Excluding the

<HEADLINE> Raytheon Issues Earnings Warning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Troubled defense giant Raytheon Co. warned investors
Tuesday that its upcoming fourth-quarter earnings report would fall short of
analysts' expectations, marking the second quarter in a row in which the company
has taken such a step.
</P>
<P>
	   Raytheon's Class B stock, which hit a 52-week high of $76.56 1/4 in July,
reached a 52-week low in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange as
it dropped $6.37 1/2, or 26 percent, to $19. Class A shares of Raytheon dropped
$6.31 1/4 to $18, also a 52-week low.
</P>
<P>
	   Raytheon is expecting earnings for the fourth quarter of 1999 to be between
20 and 25 cents per share, while analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson
Financial had been anticipating earnings of 59 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lexington, Mass.-based company also lowered its full-year earnings
estimate to $1.15 to $1.20 per share, down from the $1.40 to $1.50 per share it
projected in its earnings warning issued in October.
</P>
<P>
	   Raytheon said factors contributing to the fourth-quarter shortfall included
aircraft production and shipment delays, as well as setbacks in the signing of a
contract to build a radar system for the British military.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Nisbet, an industry analyst with JSA Research Inc. in Newport, R.I.,
blamed the troubles in part on Raytheon's complicated management structure,
which he felt made communications difficult among the company's many units.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, Raytheon announced plans to streamline its management structure
by eliminating its biggest division, Raytheon Systems Co., and revising the way
financial information is shared within the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Nisbet said the changes were a step forward, although he expected the
company to "scrape the bottom for a time before confidence is regained."
</P>
<P>
	   "These changes are complex and they take a while for everyone to get used
to," he said. "It's going to take a long time for the stock to get back to $75."
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year 2000, Raytheon expected earnings to slump to $1.60 to
$1.75, down from the $2.10 to $2.25 the company said it expected in October.
</P>
<P>
	   Raytheon blamed the future uncertainties on a variety of problems, including
slow business in the missile and missile defense sectors.

<HEADLINE> Arco Is Still in Limbo Over Merger  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WHITE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When Atlantic Richfield Co. Chairman Mike Bowlin
telephoned his counterpart at BP Amoco more than a year ago to propose the two
companies merge, he knew the deal would attract regulatory scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bowlin never expected the 10-month stalemate that has left Arco in limbo
as it waits to learn whether it will be swallowed up by BP Amoco, or again face
its betrothed as a competitor.
</P>
<P>
	   Planners don't know whether to develop new oil fields or sell them, Bowlin
said in an interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Employees don't know whether to take job offers, or hang on to collect
severance packages.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's clearly affecting the investment profile," Bowlin said. "We need to
get this behind us."
</P>
<P>
	   Last week BP Amoco and Arco took a step to do just that. They served notice
to the Federal Trade Commission that they planned to close the $30 billion
merger within 20 days, with or without the agency's approval.
</P>
<P>
	   FTC officials have said they are barred from commenting on the companies'
ultimatum. Analysts believe the move could prompta new round of negotiations
with regulators or, more likely, trigger an FTC lawsuit to block the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you can't negotiate a settlement, somewhere along the line you have to
invoke the notice. I think BP has decided they've run out of options," said Marc
Schildkraut, a former FTC oil attorney whose private practice has included work
on the Exxon-Mobil and Texaco-Shell mergers, as well as BP's union with Amoco in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The FTC is worried the merger could drive up gasoline prices on the West
Coast, already the nation's priciest market because of transportation costs and
a special formulation required by California smog regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition centers on concerns about the control the combined company could
exert over the Alaskan crude supply.
</P>
<P>
	   FTC attorneys apparently are convinced that West Coast refineries are so
dependent on Alaskan crude that they won't be able to efficiently switch to
other markets should BP try to manipulate crude prices upward, said Schildkraut.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaskan oil accounts for about 40 percent of the West Coast crude supply,
according to Arco figures, with the rest coming from foreign imports and
California production.
</P>
<P>
	   Together, BP Amoco and Arco holdings now account for 70 percent of oil
pumped in Alaska. That percentage would fall if the merger is approved. In an
agreement with the state of Alaska, BP Amoco pledged to reduce that to 55
percent by selling oil lands to competitors.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal calls for BP to divest 175,000 barrels a day of Alaskan production
and 620,000 acres of exploration lands and a share of its ownership stake in the
Trans-Alaska pipeline.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, BP is trying to accommodate refiners' concerns by offering to sell an
additional 210,000 barrels a day of Alaskan production through long-term
contracts pegged to the price of the benchmark West Texas Intermediate.
</P>
<P>
	   If refiners agree, it could make it difficult for the FTC to line up damning
court testimony against the merger, Schildkraut said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not a slam dunk for the FTC," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, uncertainty about the merger has prompted Arco to slow
drilling of new wells in its Kuparuk field on the North Slope. New seismic
survey work in other North Slope areas has been put on hold.
</P>
<P>
	   Arco is reluctant to pour money into either project because the properties
could be sold as part of the agreement with the state of Alaska if the deal goes
through.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts believe Arco could do well on its own. Oil prices have more than
doubled over the past year, and Arco is expected to announce robust 1999
earnings later this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Bowlin acknowledged that Arco is doing well for the moment, but insisted the
company still needs a partner to survive the up-and-down cycles of crude prices
over the long term. The merger is expected to yield $1 billion a year in savings
for the combined company.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are in a commodity business and economics 101 of the commodity business
is you have to be a low-cost producer on a unit of production basis. That's the
only way you can prosper or even survive," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A prolonged regulatory battle raises the odds against the merger, said Alvin
Silber, an analyst with Herzog, Heine Geduld in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it takes too long, business conditions change, fundamentals change and
the original deal doesn't really look as good as when it was first put
together," he said. "It makes the uncertainties greater and the probabilities of
completing much lower."

<HEADLINE> IOC Starts Global Ad Campaign  </HEADLINE>
    By SKIP WOLLENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee, embroiled for much of
the past year in an investigation of bribery in the Olympic-site selection
process, is starting its first global advertising campaign by recounting the
stories of Olympic heroes -- including some who may not have brought home a gold
medal.

<P>
	   The campaign's theme is "Celebrate Humanity" and will run in 200 countries
in the months leading up to the Summer Games in September in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad campaign, developed by the TBWA/Chiat Day agency, uses archival tapes

<P>
	   The IOC's media partners have agreed to run the ads at no charge as part of
their rights deals. Under that arrangement, IOC officials say the campaign may
get upwards of $150 million in exposure.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Pound, chairman of the IOC marketing commission, and Michael Payne,
director of marketing for the IOC, discussed the campaign Tuesday with reporters
in advance of its formal presentation Wednesday at a Sport Summit conference in
New York.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, the IOC executives expressed confidence that most of the
11 international Olympic sponsors will renew their four-year global marketing
deals. Four sponsors are signed up for the four-year period beyond Sydney --
Coca-Cola, Time Warner, Visa International and the computer systems integrator
SEMA. Pound said he had "handshake agreements" with four to five others and was
in talks with the others, He declined to identify them.
</P>
<P>
	   The IOC is asking in excess of $50 million for exclusive global sponsorship
rights for the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City and 2004 Summer Games in
Athens. That is up from about $40 million for the four-year period ending after
the Summer Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
	   The new advertising campaign has been in development for two years and "was
not designed as a response to the events of last year" involving the IOC, Payne
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The IOC was rocked last year by allegations that some IOC members took money
and other gifts while reviewing what turned out to be Salt Lake City's winning
bid for the 2002 Winter Games. The scandal resulted in the expulsion or
resignation of 10 IOC members, and led to the adoption of a series of reforms
late last year that included a ban on member visits to cities bidding for future
Games.
</P>
<P>
	   Pound said surveys for the IOC showed public interest in viewing the Olympic
Games on television "actually increased" over the past year despite the IOC
scandal. More than half of those quizzed told the surveyors their opinion of the
Games was higher than it had ever been.
</P>
<P>
	   Payne said the survey results "reinforced the direction we were going" in
developing the ads. Pound said no changes in advertising were made as a result
of the corruption probe.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign initially includes six TV ads, eight radio spots and numerous
print ads. The ads have been produced in English, French and Spanish with plans
to translate them into other languages.
</P>
<P>
	   The English-language TV ads are narrated by actor Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   In one TV ad, rivals are shown in competition and afterwards. "You are my
adversary, but not my enemy," the narrator says. "For without you, I am a lesser
man."
</P>
<P>
	   British runner Derek Redmond's achievement in a 1992 Olympic race in which
he tore a hamstring but limped to cross the finish line with help from his
father is recalled in both a radio and TV ad.
</P>
<P>
	   A radio ad tells how German long jumper Luz Long put a towel at the foot of
the foul line to help Jesse Owens avoid disqualification a long jump
preliminary. Owens, a black man from the U.S., went on to win, and Long embraced
him in front of Adolf Hitler's box at the 1936 Games in Berlin, the ad recalls.
</P>
<P>
	   The IOC takes a swipe in two TV ads at the advertising line "You don't win
the silver, you lose the gold" that sneaker marketer Nike used in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   One ad shows Bulgarian weight lifter Yoto Yotov's jubilation after a
performance that earned him the silver medal in 1992. The other shows the
Nigerian women's relay team hugging in jubilation after winning the bronze medal
in the 400 meter race in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   "Just a reminder, at the Olympic Games you don't have to come in first to
win," the relay team ad says.

    BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) -- Unisys Corp. earnings rose to $144.4 million, or 46
cents a share, in the fourth quarter from $135.7 million, or 40 cents a share, a
year earlier, the company said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The results for the computer systems and services company were slightly
better than the 45 cents a share expected by analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Profits in the October-December were higher despite the impact of currency
fluctuations and buyers' hesitation to make purchases because of Year 2000
computer fears, Unisys said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue declined 4.8 percent to $1.96 billion in the fourth quarter from
$2.06 billion in the same period a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Citigroup Profits Up 86 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Citigroup Inc. saw profits soar 86 percent in the fourth
quarter, topping Wall Street's most optimistic estimates. Strong fees from its
investment banking and Citibank helped boost the bottom-line results at the
nation's largest bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Underscoring the role investment banking will play in Citigroup's future,
the company said Tuesday it will spend $2.2 billion to acquire Schroder PLC's
investment banking division in London.
</P>
<P>
	   Citigroup, which owns Salomon Smith Barney, has made a big push in corporate
financial services, including underwriting stocks and bonds and advising
companies on mergers and acquisitions. Salomon Smith Barney was involved in some
of last year's biggest deals, including MCI WorldCom's purchase of Sprint.
</P>
<P>
	   The acquisition of Schroder's London-based investment banking business will
double Salmon Smith Barney's presence in Europe. The new division, which will be
called Schroders Salomon Smith Barney, however, will still pale when compared
with its large U.S. rivals, like Goldman Sachs, which dominate European deals.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is a good base for them to build from," said Diana Yates, an analyst
with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
	   Citigroup signaled that it also plans to expand in the insurance and
brokerage industries in the United States. New legislation signed late last year
eliminated the barriers that separated banks from other financial service
industries.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our exceptionally strong capital position and the successful integration of
our global businesses will enable us to take full advantage of the new financial
modernization legislation in the coming year," the company said in a statement.
"This legislation opens up new horizons for our company and will facilitate our
expansion in the global financial services arena."
</P>
<P>
	   Citigroup's shares dipped 50 cents to $58.50 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the
New York Stock Exchange as investors worried that the Federal Reserve might soon
raise interest rates, which could hurt bank profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Citigroup's fourth-quarter profits from operations totaled $2.61 billion, or
75 cents a share, beating the analysts' average estimate of 70 cents a share, as
well as the highest estimate of 73 cents, according to First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   In the fourth quarter of 1998, Citigroup had profits of $1.4 billion, or 40
cents a share, excluding one-time charges and gains. If those items are
included, Citigroup had net income of $677 million, or 19 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue for the quarter was $1.53 billion, up 15 percent from $1.33 billion
in the fourth quarter 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "Across the board everything looked pretty strong," Yates said. "The drivers
being the rebound in their corporate bank, the Salomon Smith Barney investment
bank, and the $2 billion in expenses they have taken out."
</P>
<P>
	   Corporate and investment banking business more than doubled to $1.31 billion
from $553 million, led by strong fees from its Salomon Smith Barney brokerage
and investment bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Citigroup's revenue from its banking and lending operations totaled $612
million, up 43 percent from $429 million in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, the New York-based company had profits from operations of
$9.95 billion, or $2.85 a share, up from $6.34 billion or $1.77 a share in the
previous year. Including one-time items, net income totaled $9.87 billion, or
$2.83 a share, vs. $5.81 billion, or $1.62 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Full-year revenue came to $5.95 billion, up from $5.11 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think the outlook for 2000 is also very good at this point in time,"
said Sandy Weill, co-chairman and co-chief executive.

<HEADLINE> Frigid temperatures continue their grip on New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SARANAC LAKE, N.Y. (AP) - The thermometer dipped to minus 31 early
Tuesday, making this Adirondack village the coldest spot in New York. But to the
hardy folks who call Saranac Lake home, it was just another wintry day.
<P>
	   "It hasn't caused any problems out of the ordinary," said Bruce Nason, a
village police sergeant and longtime resident.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're used to this weather. If you live here you expect it. People know
it's coming and they're usually ready for it," Nason said. "The ones that don't
like it, they're mostly gone."
</P>
<P>
	   The hustle-bustle at the local heating and plumbing businesses was one of
the few outward signs that it was cold, even by the standards of Saranac Lake,
which has on more than one occasion been the country's coldest spot.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've had to turn at least six people down today, we're so busy," said a
secretary at Scheefer's Plumbing and Heating. "It's frozen pipes mostly. All
four of my people are out and booked up for the rest of the day. People are in a
bind and we can't help them."
</P>
<P>
	   Like the rest of the Northeast, New York was locked in an arctic air mass
that plunged low temperatures into the single digits in New York City and
brought snow to the Carolinas. High winds on Monday drove temperatures to as low
as minus 50 in Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   The winds diminished Tuesday but temperatures barely made it into the teens
in upstate New York as it endured another day of bitter cold. Wednesday's
forecast was for gradually rising daytime temperatures but overnight readings
that will remain in the single digits or lower until at least the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Lows Tuesday hit minus 27 in Ogdensburg, minus 12 in Utica, minus 10 in
Watertown, minus 9 in Binghamton and minus 8 in Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   In Syracuse, the mercury dipped to minus 5 and caused a two-hour delay to
the start of school when drivers couldn't get their school buses started.
</P>
<P>
	   Even then, many buses were empty as parents choose to drive their children
to school rather than let them wait at bus stops or walk.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've crossed two kids this morning, and I usually get about 30 of them a
day. It's real slow today. I think they were smart and stayed home," said
crossing guard Mary Phillips.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's too cold to be out here," said Ben Ingersoll, who works for Bianchi
Excavating Inc. and spent more than five hours digging for a frozen pipe at a
suburban Syracuse shopping plaza.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've been doing this for 16 years and it's tough on the face. It's not
enjoyable," Ingersoll said.

<HEADLINE> Door-to-door cocaine service yields bad reviews, arrests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A delivery service that made cocaine "as easy to order
as pizza" led to the indictment of 10 men accused of catering their drug trade
to upper-class professionals in prime Manhattan neighborhoods.
<P>
	   The men were accused of operating the delivery service for the last year,
violating federal laws against conspiracy and narcotics distribution, according
to an indictment in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   The "Home Delivery Cocaine Organization," as prosecutors called it,
allegedly used beepers and cell phones for communications with well-to-do
clients whose names, telephone numbers and addresses were kept on file.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said the case "illustrates that law enforcement
will vigorously attack cocaine distribution in every strata of our society."
</P>
<P>
	   "Cocaine distribution and use is destructive of society, especially when it
becomes as easy to order as pizza," White said in a release.
</P>
<P>
	   The men indicted were accused of serving people in a myriad of professions,
including advertising, real estate, investments and even legal fields.
</P>
<P>
	   The organization's records showed hundreds of names, addresses and telephone
numbers of customers in numerous residential buildings on the Upper East Side,
the Upper West Side as well as the neighborhoods of Chelsea and Soho,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   The organization also allegedly delivered to restaurants and bars throughout
Manhattan, sometimes meeting clients on the street outside.
</P>
<P>
	   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for White, said he could not comment on whether
prosecutors were pursuing the customers of the organization.
</P>
<P>
	   But he did add, "The investigation is continuing."
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the deliveries were in small amounts: half a gram for $25, 1 gram
for $50 or 3 grams for $150, court papers showed.
</P>
<P>
	   The orders were placed by customers who beeped the organization, which then
returned the page using cellular telephones often subscribed to in fraudulent
names, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the telephones were being monitored by agents of the Drug Enforcement
Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   After an order was placed, a delivery person posing as a livery cab driver
would meet the customer at a prearranged location, sometimes the residence of
the customer, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a wake-up call to those who believe that they can avoid arrest
through the use of livery cabs and cloned cellular phones," said Lewis Rice Jr.,
special agent in charge of the DEA's New York Division. "Using or selling drugs
is tantamount to playing Russian roulette with the gun loaded."
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the defendants in the case were being held without bail. Two others
were awaiting court appearances and arrest warrants were issued for the rest.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted, each defendant faces a mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison
and a maximum of life in prison with no parole.

<HEADLINE> Wells Fargo Earnings Up 27 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Wells Fargo &AMP; Company reported a 26 percent increase
in fourth-quarter operating profits as the banking and investment company
completed its first full year after merging with Norwest Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Wells Fargo, the nation's seventh-largest bank, on Tuesday posted net income
of $970 million, or 58 cents a share, one cent below analysts' average estimate.
</P>

	   The San Francisco-based bank had profits from operations of $768 million or
46 cents a share, in the year ago period. Including one-time charges related to
the Norwest merger, Wells Fargo had a net loss of $194 million, or a loss of 12
cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>

Reserve would soon raise interest rates, squeezing the bank's future profits. In
late afternoon trading, Wells Fargo's shares were off nearly 7 percent, or by
$2.81 1/4 to $38.87 1/2 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.

duties.
</P>
<P>
	   During 1999, Wells Fargo converted two banking states and 450,000 banking
households to common systems. The company plans an additional 40 separate
systems conversions in 2000 including systems integrations in 19 banking states,
acquisitions, and new product introductions.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Industry Skeptical on Gun Proposal  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT MACY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- James Maupin checked out the sight on a new Smith &AMP; Wesson
handgun at the world's largest gun show Tuesday and offered his assessment on
President Clinton's newest gun legislation proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It means spending a lot more money on feel-good projects,'' said Maupin,
owner of JDM Enterprises, a Green Valley, Calif., gun dealership. ``This will
solve no problems. It will just create a new bureaucracy and do nothing. It's
nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton announced Tuesday that he was asking Congress for $280 million in
additional funds to hire 500 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents and
inspectors and to create a program to track guns through ballistics testing.
</P>
<P>
	   Maupin, a Los Angeles County police officer for 30 years before opening his
gun shop, was one of some 30,000 people attending the 22nd annual Shooting,
Hunting, Outdoor Trade (SHOT) Show. The event is billed as the world's largest
gun show, with a Who's Who of gun manufacturers exhibiting their weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Participants greeted Clinton's latest initiative with the same response
often advanced by the industry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have plenty of gun laws,'' said Ken Jorgensen, director of media
relations for gun manufacturing giant Smith &AMP; Wesson. ``We certainly need to see
those laws enforced. Communities who have enforced gun laws have seen crime
decrease.''
</P>
<P>
	   There has been and will continue to be ``a certain amount of political
posturing'' on gun control issues, Jorgensen added.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the president wants to spend more to enforce current laws, that's
great,'' Jorgensen said. ``A law that goes unenforced isn't much of a
deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some 1,400 companies are showcasing items ranging from rifles and handguns
to hunting gear, clothing, knives, scopes and holsters at the show, which runs
through Thursday. The show is closed to the public and manufacturers sell only
to distributors, who sell to dealers.

<HEADLINE> McCain Backs 'Don't Ask Don't Tell'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST GREENWICH, R.I. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain said Tuesday he would simply
stick to his policy stance when talking about gays in the military from now on,
one day after his assertion that he could sometimes spot homosexuals ``by
behavior and by attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, he told reporters he had served in the Navy with many gay men,
though they had not told him their sexual orientation. Asked how he knew, he
said: ``Well, I think we know by behavior and by attitudes. I think that it's
clear to some of us when some people have that lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later in the day, he backtracked, saying rather that he had had suspicions
and might have been told that certain men were gay. He made it clear that it was
a private matter that he did not pursue.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked again about the issue Tuesday, McCain declined to expand. He said in
the future he would answer questions on the topic simply by repeating his
support for the current policy for gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I intended to say, 'don't ask, don't tell.' That's how I'll answer it from
now on,'' McCain said after speaking to about 300 people in East Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is the only one of the six Republican presidential contenders who has
met with the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay group, which raised $40,000 for him in
December.
</P>
<P>
	   The important thing is not whether McCain can spot gay people but what he
does about it, said Rich Tafel, executive director of the group. ``I think we
all have thoughts about people beyond what we know. When it leads to
discrimination, that's wrong.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Named to Counsel Posts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray announced Tuesday he is
appointing two new prosecutors and promoting a lawyer who oversaw a
congressional probe of the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
	   The changes come amid the departures of two deputies who were involved in
the Monica Lewinsky investigation. J. Keith Ausbrook, former chief counsel to
the House subcommittee on national economic growth, natural resources and
regulatory affairs, will be senior counsel to Ray. He went to work for Ray's
predecessor, Ken Starr, last February.
</P>
<P>
	   As chief subcommittee counsel, Ausbrook was instrumental in an investigation
into the transfer of information from a White House database to the Democratic
Party for fund-raising purposes. The subcommittee's final report accused
President Clinton and the White House of theft of government property, an
accusation the administration flatly denied.
</P>
<P>
	   Ray also appointed Brian Stuart Chilton and Julie Thomas as associate
independent counsels. Chilton has practiced with two law firms in Washington,
D.C.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Canada Eyes Graphic Smoke Warnings  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- Photos of diseased organs would cover up to 50 percent of
cigarette packaging under a proposal expected to be announced on Canada's
national anti-smoking day, ``Weedless Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
	   Health Minister Alan Rock has been studying the matter for more than a year,
and persistent news reports said he would formally propose the new warning
regulations on Wednesday. A ministry spokesman refused to comment on the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   If approved by the government after public hearings and other steps in the
regulatory process, the warnings would be the first anywhere to include graphic
photos of diseased organs, according to Cynthia Callard of Physicians for a
Smoke-Free Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Showing a picture of a brain that's been destroyed is a much stronger way
of getting the message across,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Canada has stiffened anti-smoking regulations in recent years. Smoking is
generally prohibited in public places such as government buildings and
auditoriums, and some areas ban smoking in bars and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
	   Health warnings on cigarettes were required until the Supreme Court in 1995
struck down portions of the Tobacco Products Control Act as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   Cigarette makers continued including health warnings voluntarily, and a new
Tobacco Act passed in 1997 left it to the government to impose any regulations
on health warnings.
</P>
<P>
	   The tobacco industry has challenged other aspects of the 1997 Tobacco Act in
court, contending it amounts to a ban on cigarette advertising and therefore
infringes on free expression guaranteed by the Charter of Rights. The case is
pending.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Parker, president of the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturer's Council, was
quoted by The Globe and Mail newspaper as saying that the industry has been left
out of consultations on the government's health warning plans.
</P>
<P>
	   He questioned whether the graphic images under consideration could be
reproduced on packages, and said the industry previously agreed with the
government that cigarette packages should have warnings but disagreed over what
the warnings should say and how large they should be.
</P>
<P>
	   In the United States, cigarette makers are required to include warning
labels on packages. Two U.S. senators, Democrat Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey
and Republican Richard Lugar of Indiana, intend to propose legislation this year
that would require the warnings to be worded more clearly and directly, and to
include a list of all ingredients and cancer-causing agents in cigarettes,
Lautenberg's office said Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Freddie Mac Earnings Beat Estimates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    McLEAN, Va. (AP) -- Freddie Mac, the Congressionally chartered mortgage
company, on Tuesday reported its fourth-quarter earnings rose 27 percent as the
housing market remained strong at year's end.
</P>
<P>
	   Freddie Mac said it earned $594 million, or 79 cents a share, up from $468
million, or 62 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   That beat the 77 cents a share expected by analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue for the quarter was $1.05 billion, up from $902 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Freddie Mac -- which buys mortgages from lenders, packages them as
securities and sells them to investors -- said that a sound national economy and
a booming housing market produced record earnings in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income for the year was $2.22 billion, or $2.96 a share, up from $1.7
billion, or $2.31 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue was $4.06 billion, up from $3.34 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said credit losses fell to their lowest levels since Freddie Mac
went public 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Freddie Mac financed homes for more than 2 million families in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares in Freddie Mac were priced at $48.50, down $1.93 3/4 or nearly 4
percent, at 5:15 p.m. EST on the New York Stock Exchange.

<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Margarete Schuette-Lihotzky, Austria's first woman
architect and a prominent member of the country's anti-Nazi resistance movement,
died Tuesday after a bout of influenza, the office of Vienna Mayor Michael
Haeupl said. She was 102.
</P>
<P>
	   Schuette-Lihotzky was the first woman in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to
study architecture at the Vienna School of Arts and Crafts and rose to fame for
her work in Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   A lifelong communist, she went to Germany in 1926 where she designed
apartments for the working class. She conceived the so-called ``Frankfurt
kitchen,'' the first standardized built-in kitchen.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1930, she went to Moscow, where she worked for several years, but
returned to Austria in 1940 to take part in the anti-fascist resistance
movement, for which she was jailed by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
	   In later years, she was active in social work, but mostly shunned publicity.
</P>
<P>
	   Schuette-Lihotzky, who was born in Vienna, received many distinctions in
recent years. She would have turned 103 on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Regulators Issue Advisory on Banks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal banking regulators warned Tuesday that some banks
and other credit card lenders could be indirectly increasing their financial
risk when they fail to report customers' credit lines to credit bureaus.
</P>
<P>
	   The warning came in an advisory letter from federal banking agencies to the
heads of the nation's banks, savings and loans and credit unions. The letter
also stated that some financial institutions have not reported to credit bureaus
any mortgage or other loan information on subprime borrowers, who have inferior
credit histories and therefore pay higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The lack of reporting is not illegal, and regulations regarding data
reported to credit bureaus are open to interpretation. But the Federal Financial
Institutions Examination Council warned in the letter that incomplete credit
bureau information provided, in turn, to banks can cause them to make incorrect
lending decisions and can hurt their financial soundness.
</P>
<P>
	   "Institutions that do not modify their credit risk-management processes to
compensate for omitted data in credit bureau reports could inadvertently expose
themselves to increased credit risk," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
	   The regulators have been concerned about the practice for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The credit card lenders that omit customers' credit lines from their reports
to credit bureaus account for about one-half of the U.S. market for MasterCard
and Visa, according to regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke Jr., who oversees nationally
chartered banks, told bankers in a speech last June that while failure to report
the data is not illegal, "it can readily be characterized as unfair, it may well
be deceptive and -- in any context -- it's abusive."
</P>
<P>
	   Congress also has looked into the matter, Hawke noted.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council is made up of the
Federal Reserve; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.; the comptroller's office,
which is part of the Treasury Department; the Office of Thrift Supervision and
the National Credit Union Administration.

<HEADLINE> Report: VA Office Operates in Chaos  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY MARGASAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government office handling congressional inquiries on
behalf of veterans operated ``in an atmosphere of total chaos'' and often didn't
respond to lawmakers for months, the Veterans Affairs Department's inspector
general reports.
</P>
<P>
	   The blistering audit blames the former Office of Congressional Affairs
director, Sheila Clarke McCready, for causing a ``high degree of mistrust''
among the staff and doling out improper raises to consultants who were empowered
to make management decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. McCready, who earns $130,200 a year, was transferred from the Office of
Congressional Affairs but still holds a management position as a special
assistant to the department's undersecretary for health.
</P>
<P>
	   She did not respond to messages seeking comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
	   The congressional affairs office links the department to Americans who
contact their home state lawmakers about veterans benefits and the condition of
the health care system.
</P>
<P>
	   John Hanson, a spokesman for the department, said the congressional affairs
office receives 30 to 50 inquiries a week from members of Congress and their
staff with questions such as whether a hospital is going to close, how a
constituent can get a job with the Veterans department, or complaints about long
waits to see a doctor.
</P>
<P>
	   But Hanson said he was ``absolutely confident'' that there were no delays
for inquiries involving the delivery of any individual's benefits, saying those
were handled by a special unit, based in the Capitol complex, that was not part
of the problems cited in the report.
</P>
<P>
	   The Veterans Affairs Department provides health benefits to 3.6 million
veterans a year and cash benefits to 3.3 million veterans or their survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The impact of the workload delays has resulted in what both (Office of
Congressional Affairs) managers and staff claimed was an atmosphere of total
chaos or crisis management,'' concluded the report.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, written early this month, said the office lagged so far behind
in responding to congressional inquiries that staff members produced four
examples of documents that were backdated ``to hide ... processing delays.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the department's insistence that individual claims were not
affected, the caseworker for Rep. Terry Everett, R-Ala., said it took more than
three months to get a response to a letter she wrote last May about ``a very
sick veteran.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Eventually we got a reply and a kind of apology from them, not that it has
done the veteran any good,'' said caseworker Victoria Ebell.
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Veterans Affairs has been the subject of several critical
studies during the past year, and VA Secretary Togo West Jr. has announced he
will leave before the Clinton administration ends.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional investigators previously found that the department was wasting
up to $1 million a day on unneeded medical facilities, used $61 million in
travel funds for salaries and equipment and allowed some top administrators to
approve their own expenses.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspector general previously reported that West violated government
regulations and cost taxpayers thousands of dollars by using military aircraft
for two trips to Louisiana and Alaska in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest report, the inspector general accused Ms. McCready of
``berating'' the permanent workforce.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspector general found:
</P>
<P>
	   --The office overspent its fiscal 1999 annual budget of $2.3 million by
nearly $390,000 because of uncontrolled salary increases, excessive overtime
costs and the hiring of consultants and temporary employees.
</P>
<P>
	   --Certain staff members in the office ``were being afforded preferential
treatment for earning overtime'' and complaints of favoritism towards
consultants over permanent staff ``were substantiated.''
</P>
<P>
	   --The spending of $143,000 to hire consultants in fiscal 1999 was
``excessive and inappropriate'' because they were performing government work,
even making key decisions such as approving leave.
</P>
<P>
	   --Ms. McCready made four ``inappropriate purchases'' on her government
travel card and a consultant made another 17.
</P>
<P>
	   The VA's assistant secretary for planning and analysis, Dennis Duffy,
responded in the report that VA officials will recommend appropriate action
relating to Ms. McCready's performance. The office's new leadership will
complete a reassessment of the congressional operation by March 1, Duffy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Consultants' contracts were canceled effective last Nov. 20 and future
consultant hiring will be limited, he promised.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said Ms. McCready delayed a VA career staff's promotion due to
budgetary constraints while increasing a consultant's salary by $21,000
annually, and hiring two other consultants and extending a temporary employee's
appointment.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the report, in another case, she converted a staff position to
a consultant's post in order to provide a $10,105 pay raise, an effort to
circumvent a finding that the position could not be justified at a higher pay
level. After the conversion, the consultant approved employee leave, a function
reserved for government employees, the report said.

    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A car jumped a curb and plowed into a police
officer questioning a young man at a downtown intersection Tuesday, leaving the
14-year veteran with a severe brain injury.
<P>
	   The motorist apparently suffered a seizure and lost control of his car,
which careered off the road and struck Officer Scott McLaughlin, authorities
said. The officer was thrown in the air and landed on his head.

<P>
	   McLaughlin, 36, remained in a coma after undergoing brain surgery and was in
guarded condition Tuesday evening. Both his legs were broken, the hospital said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two officers had pulled over a car at a Main Street intersection and were
questioning a possible robbery suspect when the suspect noticed the car heading
toward them and yelled "Watch out!" police said. The other officer and the young
man were not injured.

	   The unidentified motorist was driving with a suspended license, and
authorities were weighing whether to press charges.

<HEADLINE> J.P. Morgan Profits Beat Forecasts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- J.P. Morgan reported fourth-quarter profits of $509
million, easily beating Wall Street's forecast with better-than-expected income
from trading and fees from investment banking.
</P>
<P>
	   J.P. Morgan's results totaled $2.63 a share, far above the $2 a share
average forecast from analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. J.P.
Morgan earned just $89 million, or 42 cents a share, in the fourth quarter 1998,
excluding an after-tax charge of $86 million, or 44 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite these robust results, J.P. Morgan's stock fell $4.68 3/4 to $123.31
1/4 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange as investors worried
the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates soon, squeezing bank profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues for the quarter were $2.19 billion, up 46 percent from 1.5 billion
in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
	   J.P. Morgan's investment banking revenues rose 17 percent between Sept. 1
and Dec. 31 to $309 million. Revenues from credit markets nearly doubled to $264
million in the quarter, reflecting healthier Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year 1999, net income was $2.06 billion or $10.39 a share,
compared with 1998 operating earnings before non-recurring gains and special
charges of $1.07 billion, or $5.22 a share. Net income in 1998 was $963 million,

<HEADLINE> Continental, Delta Earnings Slip  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Delta and Continental airlines reported fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday that
beat analyst expectations despite the impact of rising fuel prices. Southwest
Airlines said its results met Wall Street forecasts.
</P>
<P>
	   Most major airlines are expected to report a drop in earnings for the
fourth-quarter because of the surge in fuel prices. A barrel of oil for
near-term purchase on the New York Mercantile Exchange was quoted at $15.43 on
Oct. 1, 1998; a year later, the cost of a barrel was $24.54.
</P>
<P>
	   While airlines generally take steps to blunt the effects of rising fuel
costs, their earnings generally fall when price increases are steep.
</P>
<P>
	   Delta said its October-December earnings were $175 million or $1.24 per
share, compared with $194 million or $1.29 per share a year earlier. Analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had projected earnings at $1.09 a
share.
</P>
<P>
	   Delta, the nation's No. 3 airline based on passenger miles, reported its
earnings fell due to higher fuel prices, despite "hedged" purchases that it said
will help hold down fuel costs through June.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Delta were priced at $52.12 1/2, up $2.12 1/2 or more than 4
percent, at 5:15 p.m. EST on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The fourth-quarter results did not include one-time gains from the sale of a
portion of Delta's stake in Priceline.com and other investments. With those
gains included, Delta's net earnings came to $352 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-quarter revenues were $3.7 billion, up from $3.4 billion a year ago,
the Atlanta-based airline said.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, Delta reported net income of $1.29 billion or $8.68 per
share, compared with $1.1 billion, or $6.87 a share in 1998. Excluding the
extraordinary gains, net income for 1999 was $1.03 billion, or $6.94 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Annual revenues totaled $15 billion, up from $14.4 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Continental reported fourth-quarter earnings excluding one-time items of $33
million, or 47 cents per share, down 50 percent from $66 million, or 91 cents
per share, in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
	   The company cited the rising cost of jet plane fuel for the drop. The
results surpassed the 39 cents a share estimate of analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   The Houston-based airline, the nation's fifth-largest carrier, had revenues
of $2.15 billion, up from $1.94 billion in the 1998 period.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, Continental reported net income of $455 million, up from
$383 million in 1998. Excluding special items, 1999 income was $359 million, or
$4.89 a share, compared with 1998 items-adjusted income of $464 million, or
$6.03 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal quoted sources as saying Continental
is in negotiations to buy back a controlling interest in the carrier from
Northwest Airlines. Northwest bought into Continental for $519 million two years
ago. The government is fighting the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Continental officials were not immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Continental's stock was down $2.56 1/4, or more than 6 percent, to $38.56
1/4 at 5:15 p.m. EST on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the falloff in income, the once-struggling airline reported its
fifth-straight profitable year and ended 1999 with its stock having appreciated
32.5 percent, the greatest increase for a major U.S. airline.
</P>
<P>
	   For 1999, revenue was $8.64 billion, a 9 percent increase from the $7.93
billion the company took in the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dallas-based discount airline said its fourth-quarter net income fell to
$93.8 million, or 18 cents a share, from $100.4 million, or 19 cents, a year
earlier. It blamed the decline on the increase in the cost of jet fuel.

<HEADLINE> Grandparents, dad spar over custody of little girl  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Chantel Watkins-Murphy lives with her grandparents
during week, but spends most weekends with her father.
<P>
	   Her mother died in a car accident when Chantel was just 12 days old.
</P>
<P>
	   The little girl, now 3, is at the center of an unusual custody battle that
pits the child's maternal grandparents against her father - both family that
Chantel loves and depends on.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, the state Supreme Court, in a case that could signal a change in the
way the courts consider custody cases, will decide where Chantel should grow up.
A ruling in favor of the grandparents could alter a longstanding preference
toward the biological parent.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for both sides argued their case before the state's highest court
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Larry Watkins, 22, the child's biological father, said he has been trying to
get custody since Chantel was just weeks old. But lower courts granted custody
to the Nelsons.
</P>
<P>
	   "From day one, I stepped up to the plate and I shouldn't be knocked out of
the box," he said outside the courtroom Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Beverly Nelson, Chantel's maternal grandmother, has a different perspective.
</P>
<P>
	   While she concedes Watkins is a fit father, she questions how serious he is
about raising a child, and she is afraid that, should Watkins get custody, he
would cut off contact between the Nelsons and Chantel.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's one of my daughters," Mrs. Nelson said Tuesday. "That's how she's
being raised."
</P>
<P>
	   The case is unusual because courts typically award custody to someone other
than the biological parent only when a parent is proven unfit or abandons a
child.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither is true in this case.
</P>
<P>
	   "He loves his daughter and his daughter loves him," Joel Seltzer, Watkins'
attorney, told the state Supreme Court. "Mr. Watkins has wanted to care for his
child from the moment his child was born."
</P>
<P>
	   But JoAnne Byrnes, attorney for the Nelsons, said Watkins hasn't proved he
is responsible enough to raise his daughter.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not simply that the Nelsons won the race to the courthouse," said
Byrnes. "Mr. Watson has had many opportunities to expand his involvement (with
Chantel) and has chosen not to."
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides agree on one thing. The slow court system played a big part in
creating this very difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nelsons' daughter, Megan Murphy, was 17 when she died in a car accident
in August 1996 - just 12 days after giving birth to Chantel.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost immediately, the Nelsons filed for temporary guardianship. Watkins
counter-filed, asking to be awarded custody of his child. But in October 1996,
guardianship was awarded to the Nelsons.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, it took the courts about 18 months to decide who should get permanent
custody. By that time, March 1998, the child was almost 2 years old and had
bonded with the grandparents, and the trial court granted custody to the
Nelsons.
</P>
<P>
	   "It seems to me, in a sense, unfair to say now that the courts have done
this, the grandparents have the advantage of a psychological bond," said Justice
Marie Garibaldi.
</P>
<P>
	   But Justice Virginia Long noted that since a bond does exist, the court has
to consider it.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you say there is a psychological bond, then the question is whether
there would be harm to the child," if she were taken away from the grandparents,
Long said.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice James Coleman suggested a hearing to gather more evidence on whether
moving the child out of the grandparents' home would be damaging.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial record is incomplete on that question, as well as the question of
how close Watkins and Chantel are, the lawyers and justices agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   The case points to a shift in the way the courts handle custody cases, said
Mark Sobel, past chairman of the New Jersey Bar Association's family law
section.
</P>
<P>
	   "The court is more sensitized than it had been to important issues of who
has bonded with the child," said Sobel. "It's not going to be a knee-jerk
reaction - you're the parent and you get custody - as courts become more
sensitized to what is really in the child's best interest."
</P>
<P>
	   But, Sobel added, it is a "radical departure" from the norm to award custody
to someone other than the biological parent - unless that parent has been proven
unfit.
</P>
<P>
	   A high court ruling in favor of the grandparents would send a strong message
to lower courts.
</P>
<P>
	   "Just being a biological parent, while an important factor, would not become
the determining factor," Sobel said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Supreme Court is currently considering a case on whether
grandparents are entitled to visitation with their grandchildren, even when the
parents object.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 162.26  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks drove the Nasdaq composite index
tantalizingly close to a new closing high Tuesday, while blue-chip shares
tumbled as worries about rising interest rates distracted investors from strong
fourth-quarter corporate earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 162.26 to close at 11,560.72.
Profit-taking after a Dow rally last week also contributed to some selling.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq rose 66.54 to 4,130.81, just shy of its Jan. 3 closing record of
4,131.15. The Nasdaq has now gone through 10 straight sessions without setting a
new record, the longest streak since late October, when the technology-dominated
index began a sprint that lasted through the start of the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 10.01 to
1,455.14.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq rallied following news of the merger of JDS Uniphase and E-Tek
Dynamics, two companies that make components used in optical networking. JDS
Uniphase offered $15 billion, or about $211 per share, for E-Tek, helping shares
of E-Tek soar 42 1/2 to 178 3/8. JDS Uniphase ended up 3 1/2 at 195 11/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft, which released its earnings after the close of Wall Street's
regular trading session, rose 3 1/16 to 115 3/16 as investors anticipated a
strong report. In extended-hours trading, Microsoft slipped back to 112 1/2
after the company reported profits that beat official estimates, but missed the
most optimistic projections circulating among Wall Street traders.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't clear how the software maker's results would affect the market on
Wednesday. While Microsoft did decline in late trading, most traders had left
for the day when its earnings were announced.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq rally was a return to form for the index that soared 86 percent
in 1999 on the strength of large, well-established technology companies, from
network providers like Cisco Systems to software leaders like Microsoft. At the
start of 2000, a bout of profit-taking knocked the index nearly 10 percent below
its peak.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, however, the Nasdaq resumed its trek toward a new record as
investors proved unwilling to abandon technology stocks. Jeffrey Applegate,
chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers, said he expects many of the
large-capitalization technology leaders that led the market in 1999 to dominate
2000 as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no question these stocks are expensive, but we believe it's
deservedly so," he said. "They have the best fundamentals."
</P>
<P>
	   Several Fortune 500 companies reported stronger than expected fourth-quarter
earnings, including pharmaceutical firm Pfizer and financial services companies
Citigroup and PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite their strong profit reports, Pfizer slipped  1/2 to 36 1/2 and
Citigroup finished up just  1/2 at 58 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   Many investors were distracted by concerns about interest rates. The yield
on the Treasury's 30-year bond was up to 6.75 percent Tuesday from late Friday's
6.69 percent, reaching levels not seen since July 1997. The financial markets
were closed Monday for the holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts expect the Federal Reserve to boost interest rates a quarter
percentage point when it meets Feb. 1-2. The Fed's three rate hikes last year
did little to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial companies, which are most sensitive to interest rate changes, were
mostly lower. American Express fell 7 15/16 to 151 9/16, dragging the Dow lower.
</P>
<P>
	   Pharmaceutical concerns, which have rallied so far this year, slumped
following Monday's announcement of the planned merger of British drugmakers
SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo Wellcome. SmithKline's U.S. shares fell 8 to 62,
and Glaxo's U.S. shares dropped 5 15/16 to 54 1/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said some selling of blue chip stocks was to be expected after the
Dow rose 200 points Friday for its first finish about 11,700.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a pause to refresh, and I would use it as a buying opportunity,"
said Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc.
in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE composite volume totaled 1.30 billion shares, compared with 1.33
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.90 to 513.46.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.2 percent. Germany's Xetra DAX
index fell 2.6 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 lost 2.5 percent, and France's
CAC-40 closed 2.9 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> Isis To Cut Staff by 140  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. plans to cut its work
force by almost 40 percent, or 150 jobs, in a restructuring that follows the
failure of a drug in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
	   Isis, based north of San Diego, has about 400 employees. It develops
antisense drugs designed to stop disease at the genetic level by blocking the
release of disease-causing proteins.
</P>
<P>
	   The failed drug was supposed to fight Crohn's Disease, an intestinal
inflammation.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the failure of the treatment, the company will remain in business,
with cash and committed funds for three years of operation.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are committed to bringing antisense drugs to the market," said Stanley
T. Crooke, Isis' chairman and chief executive. "But we must conserve cash and
focus on activities that are beneficial to shareholders."
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the employees losing their jobs work in the research division, Isis
spokesman Christopher Keenan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company is developing drugs to treat psoriasis, cancer tumors, Hepatitis
C, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
	   At 4 p.m. trading, shares of Isis changed hands on the Nasdaq Stock Market
at $7.68 3/4, down $1.

<HEADLINE> Paine Webber Profits Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Paine Webber Group Inc., the fourth-largest U.S. brokerage
firm, reported Tuesday its profits rose in the fourth quarter from a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   But the October-December figure was reduced by the $60 million buyback of
preferred stock from the GE Capital Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings, after taking the buyback into account, were $101.5 million, or 67
cents a share, compared with $94.5 million, or 63 cents a share in the same
period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding the one-time stock buyback charge, Paine Webber earned $166.3
million, or $1.07 a share. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had
predicted earnings of 92 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth quarter revenues after interest expenses were $1.39 billion, up from
$1.1 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Paine Webber fell 37 1/2 cents to $37.56 1/4 in trading at 5:15
p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our 1999 results reflect strength across all business lines, including
record results in commissions, asset management, investment banking and
principal transactions," Paine Webber chairman and chief executive Donald Marron
said in a statement with the earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the firm's 1999 financial highlights were a 20 percent increase in
client assets over 1998 to $423 billion from $352 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the number of customers using PaineWebber EDGE, the company's
online brokerage service, more than doubled in 1999 to 176,000 households from
71,000 at the end of 1998. Assets invested with the service also doubled, to
$140 billion in 1999 from $60 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, Paine Webber earned $545.9 million, or $3.56 a share,
after taking into account the stock buyback. In 1998, the company earned $409.9
million, or $2.72 a share. Revenues for the year, after interest expense, were
$5.29 billion, up from $4.41 billion a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Schwab Earnings Rise in 4th Quarter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Earnings for Charles Schwab Corp. rose nearly 60
percent for the fourth quarter and 70 percent for the year, exceeding analysts'
expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's largest discount and online brokerage on Tuesday reported
earnings of $170 million or 20 cents a share on sales of $1.1 billion, up from
$106 million, or 12 cents a share, on sales of $789 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   That exceeded the forecast of 19 cents a share by analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thompson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwab said it brought in a record $33 billion in new assets to the firm
during the fourth quarter, which pushed new assets for the year to a record $107
billion, up 35 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
	   "The securities markets have experienced major swings in returns and trading
volumes," said Chairman and CEO Charles R. Schwab. "Throughout this challenging
environment, everyone at Schwab has stayed focused on delivering the best
possible service to our customers."
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Schwab earned $589 million or 70 cents a share on sales of
$3.9 billion compared to profits of $349 million or 42 cents a share in the
previous year. Sales for 1999 were $2.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts had predicted yearend earnings of 69 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Customers opened 1.5 million new accounts during the year and Schwab said it
was handling 6.6 million active accounts.

<HEADLINE> Bitter cold slugs Northeast; storms dump snow on Carolinas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Foot stomping, lip chapping cold tore through the
eastern United States on Tuesday and was blamed for the death of at least one
homeless man. Medical examiners were looking into the possibility the bitter
temperatures might be responsible for a second death as well.
<P>
	   In a whiplash reversal of temperatures recently described as "balmy," and
"unseasonably warm" around the nation, New York City's temperatures hovered in
the mid-teens with the wind chill gusting to 10 below at Kennedy Airport. At
Enosburg Falls, in northern Vermont, temperatures dipped to 38 below zero.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yup, we're a little cool up here," said Carolyn Stimpson, town clerk of
Enosburg Falls, population 2,535. "It's hard to breathe. If you're wise, you
wrap yourself up."
</P>
<P>
	   Farther south, winter caused school closings or delays in North Carolina,
South Carolina and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather stalled school buses, delayed trains and created hordes of
irritable workers who, for once, couldn't wait to get to the office.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wish I could find a way to get home without going outside," said Jeanette
Cordero, who - despite claims to an aversion to cold weather - found it within
herself to bundle up for a smoking break outside New York's Paine Webber
building. "I guess I was expecting this sooner or later. If it's just a short
time, I guess I can deal with it. Barely."
</P>
<P>
	   Maine, which often contends for the appellation of coldest place in the
continental United States, reported 21 below zero with no wind at Allagash and 4
below with a minus 35 wind chill factor in Bangor. Although lower temperatures
have been recorded in Maine this year, the effect of the wind made it feel like
the coldest.
</P>
<P>
	   "Considering the wind and the temperature, it was a bone chiller," said Art
Lester from the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   The eastern part of North Carolina was blasted by six inches of snow;
schools, courts and businesses were closed around the state. Its western
mountains, which usually suffer the brunt of winter storms, were largely spared.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very pretty," said state sheriff's office spokeswoman Carol Hoover.
But she added that law enforcers were kept busy pulling motorists out of
ditches.
</P>
<P>
	   New Yorkers also were struggling; one lost the battle. The unidentified man,
described by police as homeless, was found on a Brooklyn loading dock Monday,
when the temperature was 19 with a wind chill of minus 16. The medical examiner
said Tuesday he apparently had died of exposure. Another man described by police
as homeless was found dead in the backseat of a car he had apparently crawled
into while it was parked on a Queens street. The medical examiner's office said
an autopsy would be performed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Freezing temperatures spell "terrifying times for the homeless," said Mary
Brosnahan, director of New York's Coalition for the Homeless. "There are lot of
people fighting for their lives."
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, 6,873 men and women stayed in homeless shelters Monday night into
Tuesday, said Mitchell Netburn, first deputy commissioner of New York City's
Department of Homeless Services. The system still was 700 beds below capacity,
Netburn added.
</P>
<P>
	   Having a home didn't always ensure warmth. The city received 3,919 calls on
Monday reporting inadequate or lack of heat; its hotline usually averages 2,000
calls per week. "Our people are very busy, and are doing their best," Housing
Department spokeswoman Carol Abrams said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "This cold is disturbing," said Ar Khan, who is outside for 14 hours a day
running a magazine stand near Grand Central Terminal. "It's absolutely painful,
but I have to be out here." To make matters worse, "business is very slow."
</P>
<P>
	   Darren Stevens, 28, of Hitchin, England, arrived in New York on Monday after
spending a few months in San Diego - where temperatures on Tuesday were 72 and
rarely dip below 49.
</P>
<P>
	   "Coming over here has been a real shock to the system. It gets cold in
England but not piercing like this. I think I need to buy some gloves," Stevens
said, trying to laugh.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises in Quiet Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen and the euro in
quiet trading Tuesday ahead of a meeting of finance ministers this weekend in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0127, down from $1.0143
late Friday in New York but up from $1.0090 in Europe on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also was quoted at 105.72 Japanese yen, up from 105.70 late
Friday in New York and 104.78 yen in European trading Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. financial markets were closed Monday in observance of Martin Luther
King Jr. Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Currency markets were fairly quiet ahead of a weekend meeting of finance
ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven countries. The possibility
that the officials could make pronouncements that could affect exchange rates
has many market participants waiting on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also was quoted at 1.5928 Swiss francs, up from 1.5910, and
1.4502 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4488. The British pound rose to $1.6372 from
$1.6345.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Tuesday's
euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9313 German marks, up from 1.9283; 6.4773
French francs, up from 6.4671; and 1,908.97 Italian lire, up from 1.911.99.

<HEADLINE> Canada Issues Graphic Smoke Warning  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- Photos of diseased organs would cover up to 50 percent of
cigarette packaging under a proposal expected to be announced on Canada's
national anti-smoking day, ``Weedless Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
	   Health Minister Alan Rock has been studying the matter for more than a year,
and persistent news reports said he would formally propose the new warning
regulations on Wednesday. A ministry spokesman refused to comment on the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   If approved by the government after public hearings and other steps in the
regulatory process, the warnings would be the first anywhere to include graphic
photos of diseased organs, according to Cynthia Callard of Physicians for a
Smoke-Free Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Showing a picture of a brain that's been destroyed is a much stronger way
of getting the message across,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Canada has stiffened anti-smoking regulations in recent years. Smoking is
generally prohibited in public places such as government buildings and
auditoriums, and some areas ban smoking in bars and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
	   Health warnings on cigarettes were required until the Supreme Court in 1995
struck down portions of the Tobacco Products Control Act as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   Cigarette makers continued including health warnings voluntarily, and a new
Tobacco Act passed in 1997 left it to the government to impose any regulations
on health warnings.
</P>
<P>
	   The tobacco industry has challenged other aspects of the 1997 Tobacco Act in
court, contending it amounts to a ban on cigarette advertising and therefore
infringes on free expression guaranteed by the Charter of Rights. The case is
pending.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Parker, president of the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturer's Council, was
quoted by The Globe and Mail newspaper as saying that the industry has been left
out of consultations on the government's health warning plans.
</P>
<P>
	   He questioned whether the graphic images under consideration could be
reproduced on packages, and said the industry previously agreed with the
government that cigarette packages should have warnings but disagreed over what
the warnings should say and how large they should be.
</P>
<P>
	   In the United States, cigarette makers are required to include warning
labels on packages. Two U.S. senators, Democrat Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey
and Republican Richard Lugar of Indiana, intend to propose legislation this year
that would require the warnings to be worded more clearly and directly, and to
include a list of all ingredients and cancer-causing agents in cigarettes,
Lautenberg's office said Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Schwab Earnings Rise in 4th Quarter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Earnings for Charles Schwab Corp. rose nearly 60
percent for the fourth quarter and 70 percent for the year, exceeding analysts'
expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's largest discount and online brokerage on Tuesday reported
earnings of $170 million or 20 cents a share on sales of $1.1 billion, up from
$106 million, or 12 cents a share, on sales of $789 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   That exceeded the forecast of 19 cents a share by analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwab said it brought in a record $33 billion in new assets to the firm
during the fourth quarter, which pushed new assets for the year to a record $107
billion, up 35 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
	   "The securities markets have experienced major swings in returns and trading
volumes," said Chairman and CEO Charles R. Schwab. "Throughout this challenging
environment, everyone at Schwab has stayed focused on delivering the best
possible service to our customers."
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Schwab earned $589 million or 70 cents a share on sales of
$3.9 billion compared to profits of $349 million or 42 cents a share in the
previous year. Sales for 1999 were $2.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts had predicted yearend earnings of 69 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Customers opened 1.5 million new accounts during the year and Schwab said it
was handling 6.6 million active accounts.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Pfizer Beats Earnings Estimates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BY PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP)-- Fueled by strong sales of its best-selling drugs, Pfizer
Inc.'s fourth quarter earnings easily topped Wall Street's forecasts on Tuesday,
raising its edge in the takeover battle for rival Warner-Lambert Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer's operating profits surged 34 percent in the final quarter of 1999 to
$954 million, or 25 cents per share, compared to $711 million or 18 cents a
share a year ago. Results beat forecasts by three cents, according to analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales rose 17 percent in the quarter to $4.5 billion from $3.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   All of Pfizer's key drugs performed well in the quarter, including pills to
treat high blood pressure, depression and impotence. Sales of Viagra, Pfizer's
impotence pill, increased 19 percent to $281 million.
</P>
<P>
	   For the past two months, Pfizer has been battling to buy Warner-Lambert,
which in November agreed to a merger with American Home Products. Last week,
Warner-Lambert executives bowed to investors' pressure and said that Pfizer
appears to have a better offer. Pfizer and Warner-Lambert executives have been
meeting for the past few days to try to complete a deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert shareholders have been attracted to Pfizer because its a
faster growing and more profitable company than American Home.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anything that supports Pfizer's stock price makes their bid more attractive
to Warner-Lambert shareholders," said Linda Miller, portfolio manager of John
Hancock Global Health Sciences Fund.
</P>
<P>
	   The results didn't offer Pfizer an immediate bump in its stock, however.
Shares of the company and most other drugmakers fell Tuesday as investors took
profits following a runup during the first two weeks of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer shares fell 50 cents to $36.50 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New
York Stock Exchange. At that price, Pfizer's offer would equate to about $78
billion. American Home's stock offer stands at about $56.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer has offered 2.5 shares of its stock for each Warner-Lambert share.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to strong sales of its own drugs, Pfizer gained from its share
of drugs marketed with other companies. Those drugs included the arthritis drug
Celebrex, co-marketed with Monsanto, and the cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor,
co-marketed with Warner-Lambert. Drugs sold through alliances totaled $619
million, a 107 percent increase from the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Lipitor, which had more than $3 billion in sales last year, is a key reason
why Pfizer wants to buy Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, Pfizer's operating profit rose 29 percent to $3.38 billion
or 87 cents per share. Sales rose 20 percent for the year to $16.2 billion from
$13.54 billion.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Anticrime Ideas  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- President Clinton appealed to Congress on Tuesday to begin
the new century with a fresh slate on gun control, saying ``commonsense gun
safety'' should be the first item on this year's congressional agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton requested the lawmakers' support for a $280 million package of new
gun safety and enforcement programs that he will propose in his budget package.
</P>
<P>
	   And he asked that they ``start this new century by abandoning another stale
debate'' about whether the government should enforce existing gun laws stronger
or fight crime and prevent firearms accidents through new gun-control laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The real answer is we should do both,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   His budget package, he said, was designed to send an unambiguous message to
criminals: ``If you commit crimes with guns or violate gun laws, you will pay a
heavy price.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's usual nemesis on gun issues, the National Rifle Association,
offered cautious support for the new enforcement tools Clinton is requesting.
Clinton wants 500 new Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents and
inspectors, plus 1,000 more prosecutors focusing on gun crime at all levels and
a program to track guns through ballistics testing.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling an emphasis on increased enforcement and prosecution ``long
overdue,'' NRA spokesman Jim Manown said the organization is ready to renew its
fight against two new gun-control measures that collapsed in Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We certainly don't expect the Clinton-Gore administration to abandon their
push for new restrictions on law-abiding gun owners,'' Manown said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton announced his gun proposal during a visit to a spotless new
gymnasium and community meeting hall in the Boston neighborhood of Roxbury,
where reported crime was down more than 65 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The drop in the crime rate has been due both to changing laws and to
better enforcement and better prevention,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Boston's homicide rate dropped to a 38-year low in 1999, thanks in part to a
program that allied law enforcement, the clergy, community leaders and gang
members against crime.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston Pilot Project is credited with the homicide toll's plunge from
153 slayings in 1990 to 31 in 1999. A strong economy and declining use of crack
cocaine also contributed to improved neighborhood security.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the gun plan Clinton announced Tuesday, the administration
already has said it will ask for $10 million to develop ``smart guns'' that fire
only when held by their owners. The White House also is trying to convince gun
makers and gun dealers to agree to new safety rules, with the threat of a
national lawsuit if the groups don't comply.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House hoped to win new, tougher laws in Congress last year, when
national sentiment over gun violence ran high in the wake of high-profile
shootings such as the teen massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   In particular, Clinton wanted to tighten rules on buying guns at swap-meet
style gun shows and to require additional safety features on handguns and ban
the importation of large-capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
	   A version the White House liked passed the Senate, with the tie-breaking
vote cast by Vice President Al Gore. Clinton said that vote represented a defeat
for ``the high-pressure tactics of the NRA,'' one of the most powerful and
effective lobbies in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But we couldn't pass it in the House of Representatives even after the
travesty of Columbine High School,'' Clinton said Tuesday. ``I believe passing
commonsense gun safety legislation should be the very first action of this
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., applauded as Clinton made that appeal. But Frank
gave a sober assessment afterward of whether Republicans can be persuaded to
support the new gun proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It depends on public pressure,'' Frank said. ``The Republicans are torn.
Their primary electorate doesn't want them to do it, but I think the public
wants them to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Harry, Louise Back To Push Coverage  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Harry and Louise, the fictional couple who helped defeat
President Clinton's plan to provide all Americans health coverage, are back in
new TV ads. This time they have a different concern -- how to people who don't
have insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   The Health Insurance Association of America is reviving the characters for a
new $1 million ad campaign aimed at getting political candidates, especially
Republicans, interested in the group's proposal to bring coverage to 44 million
Americans who lack insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   The association, representing large insurance companies, favors a
combination of expanded government programs for low-income people and tax
credits to help small businesses offer insurance. It's promoting that plan as an
alternative to proposals that might detract from participation in
employer-sponsored plans crucial to large insurers.
</P>
<P>
	   In the group's previous $17 million campaign in 1994, the couple worried
that Clinton's proposal would turn health care decisions over to government
bureaucrats, limit choice of doctors and lead to the rationing of care. The
president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton criticized the ads as
misleading.
</P>
<P>
	   In the ads to start Wednesday, nationally on CNN and locally in Washington,
Harry frets about an ``epidemic'' of uninsured in America and declares, ``We
can't leave working families and kids without insurance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Chip Kahn, the group's president, says there's no irony that the characters
who sounded warnings about the effects of universal coverage are now shown
worrying about those who would benefit from it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The message is not that different,'' said Kahn. ``They were always
affirmative on health coverage, but raised questions about the Clinton health
plan.''
</P>
<P>
	   Harry and Louise still don't want government running health care. Instead
they pitch HIAA's $50 billion-a-year proposal to help the uninsured by expanding
existing government programs for low-income people, giving federal vouchers to
the working poor to purchase insurance, and providing tax credits for small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton and Republican leaders have talked about providing tax credits so
people could buy their own insurance and possibly circumvent employer-provided
insurance plans -- the main business of large insurers. The insurance group is
arguing that preserving the current system of employer-based coverage, plus
federal help for low-income people, is the best solution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think they are concerned about proposals for individual tax credits,''
said Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund, a health policy research
group. ``Their bread and butter is selling group coverage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kahn said that while Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley
-- vying for the Democratic presidential nomination -- have both outlined plans
to provide coverage for uninsured Americans, the field of GOP candidates have
virtually ignored the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   By hauling Harry and Louise out of retirement, the insurance industry hopes
to change that.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to get their attention,'' said Kahn. The initial campaign is small
but the group is looking at expanding it over time.

<HEADLINE> Report: VA Office Operates in Chaos  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY MARGASAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government office handling congressional inquiries on
behalf of veterans operated ``in an atmosphere of total chaos'' and often didn't
respond to lawmakers for months, the Veterans Affairs Department's inspector
general reports.
</P>
<P>
	   The blistering audit blames the former Office of Congressional Affairs
director, Sheila Clarke McCready, for causing a ``high degree of mistrust''
among the staff and doling out improper raises to consultants who were empowered
to make management decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. McCready, who earns $130,200 a year, was transferred from the Office of
Congressional Affairs but still holds a management position as a special
assistant to the department's undersecretary for health.
</P>
<P>
	   She did not respond to messages seeking comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
	   The congressional affairs office links the department to Americans who
contact their home state lawmakers about veterans benefits and the condition of
the health care system.
</P>
<P>
	   John Hanson, a spokesman for the department, said Tuesday the congressional
affairs office receives 30 to 50 inquiries a week from members of Congress and
their staff with questions such as whether a hospital is going to close, how a
constituent can get a job with the Veterans department, or complaints about long
waits to see a doctor.
</P>
<P>
	   But Hanson said he was ``absolutely confident'' that there were no delays
for inquiries involving the delivery of any individual's benefits, saying those
were handled by a special unit, based in the Capitol complex, that was not part
of the problems cited in the report.
</P>
<P>
	   The Veterans Affairs Department provides health benefits to 3.6 million
veterans a year and cash benefits to 3.3 million veterans or their survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The impact of the workload delays has resulted in what both (Office of
Congressional Affairs) managers and staff claimed was an atmosphere of total
chaos or crisis management,'' concluded the report.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, written early this month, said the office lagged so far behind
in responding to congressional inquiries that staff members produced four
examples of documents that were backdated ``to hide ... processing delays.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the department's insistence that individual claims were not
affected, the caseworker for Rep. Terry Everett, R-Ala., said it took more than
three months to get a response to a letter she wrote last May about ``a very
sick veteran.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Eventually we got a reply and a kind of apology from them, not that it has
done the veteran any good,'' said caseworker Victoria Ebell.
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Veterans Affairs has been the subject of several critical
studies during the past year, and VA Secretary Togo West Jr. has announced he
will leave before the Clinton administration ends.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional investigators previously found that the department was wasting
up to $1 million a day on unneeded medical facilities, used $61 million in
travel funds for salaries and equipment and allowed some top administrators to
approve their own expenses.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspector general previously reported that West violated government
regulations and cost taxpayers thousands of dollars by using military aircraft
for two trips to Louisiana and Alaska in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest report, the inspector general accused Ms. McCready of
``berating'' the permanent workforce.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspector general found:
</P>
<P>
	   --The office overspent its fiscal 1999 annual budget of $2.3 million by
nearly $390,000 because of uncontrolled salary increases, excessive overtime
costs and the hiring of consultants and temporary employees.
</P>
<P>
	   --Certain staff members in the office ``were being afforded preferential
treatment for earning overtime'' and complaints of favoritism towards
consultants over permanent staff ``were substantiated.''
</P>
<P>
	   --The spending of $143,000 to hire consultants in fiscal 1999 was
``excessive and inappropriate'' because they were performing government work,
even making key decisions such as approving leave.
</P>
<P>
	   --Ms. McCready made four ``inappropriate purchases'' on her government
travel card and a consultant made another 17.
</P>
<P>
	   The VA's assistant secretary for planning and analysis, Dennis Duffy,
responded in the report that VA officials will recommend appropriate action
relating to Ms. McCready's performance. The office's new leadership will
complete a reassessment of the congressional operation by March 1, Duffy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Consultants' contracts were canceled effective last Nov. 20 and future
consultant hiring will be limited, he promised.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said Ms. McCready delayed a VA career staff's promotion due to
budgetary constraints while increasing a consultant's salary by $21,000
annually, and hiring two other consultants and extending a temporary employee's
appointment.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the report, in another case, she converted a staff position to
a consultant's post in order to provide a $10,105 pay raise, an effort to
circumvent a finding that the position could not be justified at a higher pay
level. After the conversion, the consultant approved employee leave, a function
reserved for government employees, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Arkan Slay Accomplice Said Nabbed  </HEADLINE>
   By DUSAN STOJANOVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- With rumors of a government role in the slaying
of Serbia's most notorious warlord sweeping the country, two pro-government
newspapers reported Tuesday that a wounded accomplice was in custody.
</P>
<P>
	   Speculation has been growing that the government had a hand in the attack on
Zeljko Raznatovic, known as Arkan, because he was prepared to give evidence
against Yugoslav leaders to war crimes investigators at The Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrest reports appeared aimed at countering those rumors.
</P>
<P>
	   In its article, the government-owned newspaper Politika said claims of ``the
attack being the work of professionals because of Arkan's participation in the
war or because of the activities of The Hague tribunal, do not hold water.'' The
report on the alleged accomplice's arrest was also carried by the pro-government
daily Vecernje Novosti.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan was killed Saturday in the lobby of the Intercontinental Hotel. His
bodyguard and an associate were also slain. According to the newspapers, the
unidentified accomplice underwent surgery but had not regained unconsciousness.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Politika, the gunman, who remains at large, shot Arkan in the
head, then fired at the two others.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Together with his accomplice, he broke into a run, making it to the
entrance of the hotel,'' Politika said. ``At this moment, Arkan's sole bodyguard
opened fire after them. He shot the accomplice who staggered and fell but
despite the heavy gunshot wound, succeeded in escaping together with the killer
with a car waiting nearby.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear how the accomplice wound up in custody at a Belgrade hospital
after reaching the getaway car.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for Belgrade police told The Associated Press that she could
not confirm the newspaper reports nor provide any other details of the
investigation. Staff members at the main Belgrade medical complex refused any
comment and referred reporters to the director, who was said to be unavailable
too.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition politicians have alleged that Arkan was murdered because he knew
too much about the alleged involvement of Milosevic and other senior officials
in atrocities committed during ethnic wars in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Arkan and Milosevic have been indicted for war crimes committed during
the violent breakup of the former Yugoslavia. Arkan's ``Tigers'' militia was
reportedly trained by Milosevic's security agents and were responsible for some
of the most brutal atrocities of the Croatian and Bosnian wars.
</P>
<P>
	   At The Hague, Paul Risley, spokesman for the war crimes tribunal, said two
lawyers claiming to represent Arkan contacted the court separately last year,
indicating he was interested in negotiating a deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Risley said it was never clear whether the two lawyers actually
represented Raznatovic.
</P>
<P>
	   With no official police account of the killing, Belgrade's newspapers were
full of conflicting reports, which further encouraged speculation of high-level
involvement.
</P>
<P>
	   Vecernje Novosti and the independent Blic dailies said Tuesday that Arkan
knew the killer, shaking hands and kissing him moments before the assailant
opened fire. The newspapers said the two associates were apparently shot because
they could identify the killer.

president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton criticized the ads as
misleading.
</P>
<P>
	   In the ads to start Wednesday, nationally on CNN and locally in Washington,
Harry frets about an ``epidemic'' of uninsured in America and declares, ``We
can't leave working families and kids without insurance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Chip Kahn, the group's president, says there's no irony that the characters
who sounded warnings about the effects of universal coverage are now shown
worrying about those who would benefit from it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The message is not that different,'' said Kahn. ``They were always
affirmative on health coverage, but raised questions about the Clinton health
plan.''
</P>
<P>
	   Harry and Louise still don't want government running health care. Instead
they pitch HIAA's $50 billion-a-year proposal to help the uninsured by expanding
existing government programs for low-income people, giving federal vouchers to
the working poor to purchase insurance, and providing tax credits for small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton and Republican leaders have talked about providing tax credits so
people could buy their own insurance and possibly circumvent employer-provided
insurance plans -- the main business of large insurers. The insurance group is
arguing that preserving the current system of employer-based coverage, plus
federal help for low-income people, is the best solution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think they are concerned about proposals for individual tax credits,''
said Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund, a health policy research
group. ``Their bread and butter is selling group coverage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kahn said that while Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley
-- vying for the Democratic presidential nomination -- have both outlined plans
to provide coverage for uninsured Americans, the field of GOP candidates have
virtually ignored the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   By hauling Harry and Louise out of retirement, the insurance industry hopes
to change that.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to get their attention,'' said Kahn. The initial campaign is small
but the group is looking at expanding it over time.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Wants Tests on OTC Drug Role  </HEADLINE>
   By DEB RIECHMANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prescription painkillers and over-the-counter cold pills
can cause drowsiness in even the safest drivers. To help save lives, federal
safety officials want new tests done to find out what role these medications
play in fatal truck, train, bus and boat accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   Pilots killed in plane crashes already are routinely tested for commonly
prescribed drugs and drugstore remedies. Now, the National Transportation Safety
Board wants similar testing done for other means of travel. And the board wants
the Transportation Department to produce a list of pills people can safely pop
when operating large trucks on the freeways, freight and passenger trains, boats
and buses traveling in and out of town.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Since 1987, the safety board has investigated over 100 accidents in all
modes of passenger transportation that involved prescription or over-the-counter
medications whose effects could potentially impair the vehicle's operator,'' the
NTSB said in issuing its safety recommendation.
</P>
<P>
	   That happened June 20, 1998, when a bus traveling along the Pennsylvania
Turnpike hit a parked tractor-trailer. Seven people died and 18 were injured.
The alertness of the driver was hampered by an antihistamine he was taking to
fight a chronic sinus problems, the safety board said in citing causes of the
crash.
</P>
<P>
	   In aviation, prescription and over-the-counter drugs contributed to 84 of
4,840 -- about 2 percent -- fatal plane accidents that occurred between 1987 and
1996, the board said. More than 120 people died in these plane accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   One on Feb. 4, 1995, involved a Cessna 150 that crashed into a tree near
Arnaudville, La., slid into water and sank. The safety board cited the pilot's
use of Valium, a tranquilizer and muscle relaxant, as a factor in the crash that
killed the pilot and injured a passenger.
</P>
<P>
	   The safety board's recommendation does not include automobiles. But the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that 100,000 crashes --
about 3 percent to 4 percent of motor vehicle accidents -- occur each year as a
result of drivers falling asleep behind the wheel. While not directly linked to
prescription or over-the-counter drugs, NHTSA says the accidents, which involve
motorcycles to 18-wheelers, cause 76,000 injuries and 1,500 deaths each year.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the Transportation Department, who declined to be
identified, said the department and its agencies that regulate trucks, buses,
trains and boats, are reviewing the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The department is concerned about the potential side effects of
prescription and nonprescription medications used in transportation
operations,'' the spokesman said. He said the department has initiated
informational campaigns on the problem and already does extensive tests for
illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators of most surface transportation accidents gather information on
vehicle operators' use of five classes of drugs -- marijuana, cocaine, opiates,
amphetamines and phencyclidine, or PCP -- identified in Transportation
Department regulations. The Federal Railway Administration also tests for
barbiturates and benzodiazepines, which includes Valium.
</P>
<P>
	   But little data is collected on the role prescription drugs, such as
antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications, and over-the-counter drugs,
including antihistamines, play in these accidents. This prompted the board to
recommend that the Transportation Department establish requirements for doing
toxicological tests on a representative sample of operators involved in fatal
highway, railroad, bus and marine accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   The NTSB's safety recommendation also asks the Food and Drug Administration
to develop easy-to-recognize warnings for prescription or over-the-counter drugs
that can specifically interfere with a person's ability to drive. In Sweden,
such drugs are labeled with a warning triangle, the board said, and pharmacists
in Australia often voluntarily affix a red triangle even though it's not
required under the law.
</P>
<P>
	   In March, FDA regulations took effect requiring consumer-friendly labels
that provide instructions in large print and highlight proper dosages and safety
warnings. The FDA will review the NTSB recommendation as it works on future
labeling policies, spokeswoman Susan Cruzan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA already includes warnings about operating vehicles in labeling it
approves for new prescription drugs, she said. ``It's up to the pharmacist to
provide the information to the consumer,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Help Increase Family Wealth  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thanks to a good economy and a booming stock market, the
typical American family saw a huge 17.6 percent jump in family wealth in the
mid-1990s, according to a new government survey released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve reported that the typical family's net worth rose to
$71,600 in 1998, up from a net worth of $60,900 in 1995, after adjusting for
inflation. At the same time, the Fed found that families earning less than
$25,000 a year saw their median net worth slide with the poorest suffering a
drop of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Net worth represents a family's assets in such things as bank accounts,
stocks and a home, minus the family's liabilities, covering such things as a
home mortgage, car loans and credit card debt.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed survey, the government's most comprehensive look at family wealth,
is done every three years. The new survey, being published in the Federal
Reserve's monthly bulletin for January, was based on interviews with 4,309
families.
</P>
<P>
	   The 17.6 percent increase from 1995 to 1998 in median net wealth -- the
point where half the families hold more assets and half hold less -- compared
with a much smaller 7.8 percent rise for the three years ending in 1995 and an
actual drop of 5.3 percent in family wealth for the three years ending in 1992,
when the country struggling to recover from the 1990-91 recession.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A continued rise in the holding of stock equity combined with a booming
stock market accounts for a substantial part of the rise in net worth,'' the Fed
said in its report.
</P>
<P>
	   The percentage of American families holding stock -- either directly or
indirectly as part of a mutual fund or retirement account -- hit an all-time
high of 48.8 percent in 1998, up from 40.4 percent in 1995 and just 31.6 percent
in 1989, before the start of the record-breaking Bull Market of the 1990s, the
Fed survey found.
</P>
<P>
	   During the latest period from 1995 to 1998, the Standard and Poor's index of
500 stocks surged an extraordinary 76 percent while another major asset for most
families, the value of the family home, went up by 15 percent to $129,500, the
Fed said.
</P>
<P>
	   Based on these factors, family wealth should look even better currently:
Stocks have continued climbing to new records and the increase in home values
has also accelerated, reflecting a sizzling housing market that has yet to slow
significantly even after the Federal Reserve began boosting interest rates in
late June to cool the economy down.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed report noted that while the typical American family was seeing
rising wealth gains from 1995 to 1998, not all income groups were benefiting
equally.
</P>
<P>
	   Families earning less than $10,000 annually actually saw their median net
worth fall by 25 percent to $3,600 in the three-year period ending in 1998 while
the median net worth of families earning between $10,000 and $24,999, was down
20 percent to $24,800.
</P>
<P>
	   The median net worth of families earning $25,000 to $49,999 was up 6.3
percent to $60,300 while families earning $50,000 to $99,999 enjoyed the biggest
jump in median net worth, a 20 percent increase to $152,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Families with annual incomes above $100,000 showed basically no change in
their already sizable median net worth, which stood at $510,800 in 1998,
compared with $511,400 in 1995. However, this group's average net worth -- a
calculation that captures the huge gains made by the wealthiest Americans --
rose 22.4 percent to $1.73 million, up from an average net worth of $1.41
million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed survey looked at annual incomes as well as net worth for families,
reaching similar conclusions as other surveys that there is a growing gap
between the poorest Americans and the very wealthy. The Fed said a similar
pattern was shown by the wealth statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed survey found that families headed by someone with less than a high
school diploma continued to see a slide in net wealth, down to $20,900 in 1998,
compared with $24,000 in 1995 and $30,700 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   At the other end of the scale, families headed by someone with a college
degree saw their median net worth soar by 32 percent to $146,400 last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We see a lot of indications that people with skills to sell can do quite
well,'' said a Fed official who briefed reporters on the survey on condition
that his name not be used.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking at the type of asset owned by the typical family, retirement
accounts, such as 401K accounts, represented 27.5 percent of total financial
assets, the biggest percentage, followed by direct ownership of stocks, which
accounted for 22.7 percent of the median family's holdings.
</P>
<P>
	   In terms of nonfinancial assets, the family home accounted for 47.1 percent
of nonfinancial holdings while the family car represented 6.5 percent of total
nonfinancial holdings.

<HEADLINE> More frozen inspection stations lead to frozen payments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - At least six inspection stations had to turn away
motorists for all of part of the day Tuesday after frigid temperatures froze
testing equipment. Meanwhile, state officials renewed their vow to withhold
payments from the contractor operating the stations.
<P>
	   Most of the problems occurred with dynamometers, the equipment that
simulates driving conditions to check auto emissions.
</P>
<P>
	   Toms River, Lodi, Ridgewood, Randolph, Paramus and Montclair all had
cold-related problems that forced the closure of their inspection lanes. It was
the second time that sub-freezing temperatures brought parts of the system to a
screeching halt.
</P>
<P>
	   The problems could not have come at a worse time for Parsons Infrastructure
and Technology, the Pasadena, Calif., company hired by the state to privatize
the inspection stations. Gov. Christie Whitman's administration already has
fined the company $369,000 for failing to meet performance guarantees in its
contract.
</P>
<P>
	   The state will deduct fines it assessed Parsons from payments the firm is
due to receive soon, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's our position that the fines are due and owed, and we will start
deducting them," said Whitman spokesman Pete McDonough. "Their performance has
been far below any reasonable standard."
</P>
<P>
	   McDonough said it is apparent the firm did not take New Jersey's winter
weather into account when it planned to offer inspection services here.
</P>
<P>
	   "Winter is not an unforeseen circumstance," he said. "Anyone who fails to
realize that winter arrives in New Jersey has been spending too much time behind
the tail pipe."
</P>
<P>
	   Parsons is due a payment on the 10th of each month based on the number of
cars it inspects, said state Treasury spokeswoman Mary Lou Murphy. Although the
number varies, it averages about $3 million a month. The $369,000 in fines, plus
any additional fines imposed in future weeks, will be deducted from the February
payment, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   But a spokeswoman for Parsons said the company is reviewing how the fines
were assessed and whether they should apply.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're confident we can work this out with the state and reach a conclusion
that is fair and equitable for everyone," said Jennifer Kline.
</P>
<P>
	   Parsons has been under fire since the new, tougher emissions test went into
effect last month. Waiting times of up to four hours enraged drivers, and had an
angry Whitman ordering the company to do whatever it took to get motorists
through the lanes faster.
</P>
<P>
	   The company at first attributed the delays to employees becoming familiar
with the new equipment, and promised to hire additional workers. Parsons ran
radio advertisements Tuesday urging people to apply for jobs as inspections
attendants.

<HEADLINE> US Faulted on Iran Nuke Containment  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A senior Israeli defense official says U.S. efforts to
contain Iran's nuclear capability are a failure -- partly because of Europe's
refusal to cooperate -- and it's time to develop new strategies.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said Tuesday that a news report this
week claiming that the CIA believes Iran may be able to make nuclear weapons has
sparked alarm in Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The United States, to tell the truth, failed in its efforts to prevent
this project,'' Sneh, who often speaks for Prime Minister Ehud Barak, told
Israel radio. ``We need to continue to build against them a wall of deterrence,
perhaps different and greater than the one we have today.''
</P>
<P>
	   He would not elaborate, but Israel is actively pursuing peace talks with
Syria -- one of Iran's only allies -- in an effort to isolate the Islamic state,
which Israel has long designated as the most potent threat in the region.
</P>
<P>
	   Sneh said Israel will continue to develop its military deterrence
capabilities to counter Iranian missiles with a range large enough to strike
Israel, Sneh added.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's clear that such missiles with such a large radius and warhead
capability are not intended to solve their problems with Iraq, their enemy
neighbor,'' Sneh said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel is widely believed to have nuclear weapons of its own, but has never
publicly acknowledged possessing them. Western intelligence reports say the
country is the only nuclear power in the Mideast, and has a significant
stockpile.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Times reported Monday that the CIA could no longer rule out
that Iran may be able to make a nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
	   American and Israeli concern over the Iranian projects has grown in the face
of unsuccessful White House efforts to persuade Russia not to provide missile
and nuclear-power technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian engineers are already building one reactor at a site in southern
Iran under an existing contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Sneh also blamed European states seeking to expand trade with Iran for not
cooperating with the U.S. efforts to stem the flow of nuclear know-how into the
Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``European nations did not help the United States with this and they weren't
really cooperative in the coalition against Iranian achievement of nuclear
capability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sneh hinted that Israel may take action to halt Iranian nuclear projects but
said he would not specify.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a list of other things'' that must be done, he said. ``But I'm
not sure they should be discussed publicly.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sneh has said in the past that Israel should consider a pre-emptive strike
on Iran to destroy its nuclear capabilities. In 1981, Israeli fighter bombers
destroyed a nuclear reactor in Iraq shortly before it was to become operational.
Israel believed the reactor would be used to manufacture nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel also has successfully tested the anti-missile Arrow system, which was
developed in part as a defense against Iran's Shahab-3 missile.

<HEADLINE> Bank One Meets Reduced Expectations  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Bank One Corp. reported a 13 percent drop in fourth-quarter
earnings Tuesday, closing the books on a turbulent year dominated by troubles
with its credit-card operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Executives of the fourth-biggest U.S. bank insisted for the second time in a
week that its problems are limited to the First USA unit and they will have them
cleared up by year's end.
</P>
<P>
	   Profits were in line with expectations, which were lowered just a week ago
after Bank One downgraded its outlook.
</P>
<P>
	   The banking company also confirmed it was taking a charge of $725 million
resulting largely from its woes with First USA, the nation's No. 2 credit-card
issuer.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bottom line was what they had indicated last week," said Joseph Duwan,
an analyst for Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods Inc. in New York. "They really took the
suspense out of it."
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding the special charge, earnings for the three months ended Dec. 31
were $904 million, or 78 cents a share, down from $1.04 billion, or 88 cents a
share, in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Including the special, one-time charges, Bank One reported net income of
$411 million, or 36 cents a share, for the quarter, up from net income of $226
million, or 19 cents a share, in the fourth quarter 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bank One's operating results for the fourth quarter and full year are
consistent with previously communicated expectations," said Verne Istock,
president and acting chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   "All of Bank One's businesses, except credit card, continue to perform
within targeted ranges. We have a comprehensive plan to rebuild First USA's
performance close to industry levels by the end of 2000," said Istock, who hopes
to get the permanent CEO's job.
</P>
<P>
	   Bank One stock, which hit an all-time low last week of $28.62 1/2, fell 68
3/4 cents to $31.43 3/4 in trading Tuesday at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock
Exchange, well off its 52-week high of $63.56 1/4 set last spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts remain skeptical that the company's problems lie exclusively
within First USA.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the Street has much more of a show-me attitude," Duwan said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, Bank One's profits from operations totaled $4.08 billion,
or $3.46 a share, up from $3.87 billion, or $3.25 a share, a year earlier. Net
income for the year was $3.48 billion, or $2.95 a share, vs. $3.11 billion, or
$2.61 a share.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall on New Inflation Fears  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices finished lower Tuesday on renewed fears of a
pending interest rate hike.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond are at their highest levels in
two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year note ended with a loss of 11/16 point, or $6.88 per
$1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to
6.75 percent, up from 6.69 percent late Friday, and the highest level since
touching 6.78 percent on June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the high yields, investors are shying away from the bond market for
fear Federal Reserve Board policy makers will increase interest rates at their
next meeting in February in an effort to dampen the roaring U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said professional money managers are apparently avoiding the bond
markets as they wait for signs that the Fed is satisfied with interest rate
levels.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising interest rates hurt bond prices, since bonds pay a fixed rate of
return.
</P>
<P>
	   Other factors contributing to the downturn include a glut of supply and
weakness in overseas bond markets.
</P>
<P>
	   In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities were off by
between 1/32 point and 7/32 point, and intermediate maturities were off between
9/32 point and 15/32, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.37 percent as the discount fell
0.02 percentage point to 5.23 percent. Six-month yields were unchanged at 5.66
percent, as the discount held at 5.43 percent. One-year yields were 6.10 percent
as the discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 5.76 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks,
traded at 5.94 percent from 5.44 percent late Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield of the Bond Buyer index for municipal funds rose to 6.31 percent,
up from 6.29 percent Friday.

<HEADLINE> Grandparents, dad spar over custody of little girl  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Chantel Watkins-Murphy lives with her grandparents
during week, but spends most weekends with her father.
<P>
	   Her mother died in a car accident when Chantel was just 12 days old.
</P>
<P>
	   The little girl, now 3, is at the center of an unusual custody battle that
pits the child's maternal grandparents against her father - both family that
Chantel loves and depends on.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, the state Supreme Court, in a case that could signal a change in the
way the courts consider custody cases, will decide where Chantel should grow up.
A ruling in favor of the grandparents could alter a longstanding preference
toward the biological parent.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for both sides argued their case before the state's highest court
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Larry Watkins, 22, of Cranford, the child's biological father, said he has
been trying to get custody since Chantel was just weeks old. But lower courts
granted custody to the Nelsons, who live in Holland Township, Hunterdon County.
</P>
<P>
	   "From day one, I stepped up to the plate and I shouldn't be knocked out of
the box," he said outside the courtroom Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Beverly Nelson, Chantel's maternal grandmother, has a different perspective.
</P>
<P>
	   While she concedes Watkins is a fit father, she questions how serious he is
about raising a child, and she is afraid that, should Watkins get custody, he
would cut off contact between the Nelsons and Chantel.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's one of my daughters," Mrs. Nelson said Tuesday. "That's how she's
being raised."
</P>
<P>
	   The case is unusual because courts typically award custody to someone other
than the biological parent only when a parent is proven unfit or abandons a
child.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither is true in this case.
</P>
<P>
	   "He loves his daughter and his daughter loves him," Joel Seltzer, Watkins'
attorney, told the state Supreme Court. "Mr. Watkins has wanted to care for his
child from the moment his child was born."
</P>
<P>
	   But JoAnne Byrnes, attorney for the Nelsons, said Watkins hasn't proved he
is responsible enough to raise his daughter.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not simply that the Nelsons won the race to the courthouse," said
Byrnes. "Mr. Watson has had many opportunities to expand his involvement (with
Chantel) and has chosen not to."
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides agree on one thing. The slow court system played a big part in
creating this very difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nelsons' daughter, Megan Murphy, was 17 when she died in a car accident
in August 1996 - just 12 days after giving birth to Chantel.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost immediately, the Nelsons filed for temporary guardianship. Watkins
counter-filed, asking to be awarded custody of his child. But in October 1996,
guardianship was awarded to the Nelsons.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, it took the courts about 18 months to decide who should get permanent
custody. By that time, March 1998, the child was almost 2 years old and had
bonded with the grandparents, and the trial court granted custody to the
Nelsons.
</P>
<P>
	   "It seems to me, in a sense, unfair to say now that the courts have done
this, the grandparents have the advantage of a psychological bond," said Justice
Marie Garibaldi.
</P>
<P>
	   But Justice Virginia Long noted that since a bond does exist, the court has
to consider it.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you say there is a psychological bond, then the question is whether
there would be harm to the child," if she were taken away from the grandparents,
Long said.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice James Coleman suggested a hearing to gather more evidence on whether
moving the child out of the grandparents' home would be damaging.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial record is incomplete on that question, as well as the question of
how close Watkins and Chantel are, the lawyers and justices agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   The case points to a shift in the way the courts handle custody cases, said
Mark Sobel, past chairman of the New Jersey Bar Association's family law
section.
</P>
<P>
	   "The court is more sensitized than it had been to important issues of who
has bonded with the child," said Sobel. "It's not going to be a knee-jerk
reaction - you're the parent and you get custody - as courts become more
sensitized to what is really in the child's best interest."
</P>
<P>
	   But, Sobel added, it is a "radical departure" from the norm to award custody
to someone other than the biological parent - unless that parent has been proven
unfit.
</P>
<P>
	   A high court ruling in favor of the grandparents would send a strong message
to lower courts.
</P>
<P>
	   "Just being a biological parent, while an important factor, would not become
the determining factor," Sobel said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Supreme Court is currently considering a case on whether
grandparents are entitled to visitation with their grandchildren, even when the
parents object.

<HEADLINE> Delta Pine Sues Monsanto Corp.  </HEADLINE>
    By TIMOTHY R. BROWN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Delta Pine and Land is taking agribusiness giant
Monsanto Corp. to court, seeking more than $1 billion in a fight over a failed
merger between the two companies.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis-based Monsanto Corp. and DPL were in the process of merging until
the deal was halted by what Monsanto claimed were hurdles in regulatory approval
from the U.S. Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
	   Delta Pine, a commercial breeder, producer and marketer of cotton and
soybean planting seed, initially filed suit Dec. 30. DPL dropped the suit on
Jan. 4 when Monsanto paid the Scott-based company $81 million to legally end the
proposed $1.75 billion merger announced in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest suit, which was filed Tuesday in Bolivar County, claims Monsanto
breached its contractual obligations by never attempting to resolve objections
from the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
	   "We regret having to file this lawsuit, but we had no other choice in order
to protect the interests of our company and our shareholders," Roger Malkin,
chairman and CEO of Delta Pine, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Monsanto, one of the world's largest agribusiness companies and the
second-largest seed company in the world, said the suit is without merit.
</P>
<P>
	   "For a year and a half, we exercised every reasonable effort and a
tremendous amount of time, energy and money to make this happen," Monsanto
president Hendrik A. Verfaillie said.
</P>
<P>
	   "After numerous attempts to reach an acceptable compromise with the
Department of Justice, we concluded that the department's demands made no sense
from a business point of view,"
</P>
<P>
	   Verfaillie said the Justice Department's demands would "place both Monsanto
and Delta and Pine Land at an unfair competitive disadvantage in the
marketplace."
</P>
<P>
	   Malkin said his company's relationship with Monsanto would continue through
licensing agreements and as a technology provider.
</P>
<P>
	   "The filing of this lawsuit will not affect our existing contractual
relationships with Monsanto with respect to the development of agricultural
technologies and the delivery of products to our customers," he said.

<HEADLINE> McCain Challenges Bush on Web Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By HOLLY RAMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- John McCain signed a pledge not to tax Internet sales
Tuesday, saying ``we should not harm this baby in the cradle,'' and challenged
George W. Bush to take the same stand. Bush declined and advised New Hampshire
voters to take a critical look at McCain's own tax plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican presidential contenders also took their tax arguments to the
airwaves in new ads. Bush said McCain trusts ``the people of Washington'' rather
than the people of New Hampshire to spend money. McCain said that unlike Bush,
``I won't take every last dime of the surplus and spend it on tax cuts that
mostly benefit the wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Concerning the Internet, Bush said he favored continuing a moratorium on
taxing e-commerce but wanted to know ``what the world looks like'' after three
to five years of further changes before making a long-term decision.
</P>
<P>
	   With Internet commerce generating an estimated $170 billion in revenue last
year, McCain promised to support a permanent ban on taxing access, sales or use.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all know the growth of the Internet is probably the greatest phenomenon
we've seen in our lifetime,'' the Arizona senator said at a Chamber of Commerce
breakfast after signing the pledge drafted by Citizens for a Sound Economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The group's ``e-Freedom Declaration'' asks candidates to support making
permanent the current moratorium on Internet taxes. That moratorium does not
address state sales taxes on e-commerce, which are controlled by a Supreme Court
decision requiring a business to have a physical presence in a state before it
can be forced to collect sales taxes. The principle is the same as for catalogue
sales.
</P>
<P>
	   A congressional panel is also mulling the long-term future of Internet
taxes, including whether to recommend a ban on all sales taxes -- a ban McCain
supports.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I challenge all the candidates, including Governor Bush, to take this
pledge,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he wouldn't be signing the pledge, preferring an extension of the
moratorium and more study.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to make sure I understand what the world looks like three to five
years from now before I speak further,'' Bush said while campaigning in
Pittsfield.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spent little time on the question, quickly turning the discussion back
to his issue of the week -- comparing his tax cut plan with McCain's.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Two things I'd like to say: I've made it clear that I'm for extending the
moratorium on Internet taxes. The second thing is, Senator McCain needs to
explain his plan to the people, why his raising taxes to the tune of $40 billion
is a tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
	   After criticizing the senator's plan, he said he would always stick by his
own.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's a Washington mindset that says, 'I'll lay out something and
then if it takes on a little water, I'll amend it and keep amending it,''' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's important for the people of this state to analyze everybody's plan,''
he said. He contended that McCain ``has laid out a plan that's going to tax
education benefits, he's going to tax meals for employees (that they're) getting
from their employers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's campaign is rallying business supporters, including high-tech
companies and real estate people, to protest McCain provisions they say would
cut into fringe benefits that are used to attract employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain camp quickly distributed a statement in which he said, ``Governor
Bush is purposely misrepresenting my tax plan.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He and his advisers know my plan will close tax loopholes that
corporations use to write off health spas, sports tickets and free parking for
their top executives and has nothing to do with taxes paid by employees,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, McCain has proposed cutting taxes by $237 billion over five years.
He has said it is irresponsible to cut taxes further until the financial future
of Social Security and Medicare are taken care of.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's plan would deliver a five-year, $483 billion tax cut. He says the
only way to be certain that projected budget surpluses are not spent by the
federal government is to refund most of the money to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, while campaigning on Tuesday, cut a new TV ad to air later in the
evening emphasizing his differences with McCain on taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My opponent trusts the people of Washington to spend money. I trust the
people of New Hampshire to make the right decisions for their family,'' Bush
says in the ``crash ad'' spot. ``If he says something I don't agree with I'm
going to point it out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, McCain makes his case in a 30-second ad that began airing over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's one big difference between me and the others. I won't take every
last dime of the surplus and spend it on tax cuts that mostly benefit the
wealthy,'' McCain says. He mentions his plans to put money into Social Security
and to pay down the national debt and concludes: ``I'll target the large tax
cuts to those who need it most, America's middle-class working families.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Officials Balk at Proposal  </HEADLINE>
    By MARK BABINECK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOUSTON (AP) -- The oil industry is considering suing the federal government
if the Interior Department proceeds with revised royalty rules for production on
public land.
</P>
<P>
	   Dave Deal, counsel for the American Petroleum Institute, said Tuesday that
the current structure of the proposed rule will overvalue the oil collected on
federal leases, resulting in unfairly high royalties.
</P>
<P>
	   Interior's Minerals Management Service, which has wrestled for four years
with the industry over a new rule, has said oil producers have not been paying
their fair share.
</P>
<P>
	   "You cannot claim as lost royalties revenues what you were not entitled to
in the first place," Deal said. "It will increase revenues (for the government),
but it is unlawful."
</P>
<P>
	   The new rule can take effect only after a March 15 congressional moratorium
expires. Deal said he cannot promise the petroleum institute or any other
industry organization would sue, but acknowledged it is a strong possibility.
</P>
<P>
	   A new round of public workshops began Tuesday in Denver, moving to Houston
on Wednesday and then to Washington on Thursday. However, both Deal and Fred
Hagemeyer, manager of royalty affairs for Marathon Oil, are pessimistic the
Minerals Management Service will see things their way.
</P>
<P>
	   The reason the agency isn't likely to make any changes is because the rule
is on target, said Beth Daley, spokeswoman for the government watchdog group
Project on Government Oversight.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bottom line here is that oil companies are going to be unhappy with the
rule because they'll have to pay the taxpayers," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics contend the current system allows oil companies to understate the
value of oil they pull from public lands by selling it at deflated prices,
either to agreeable competitors or subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
	   The industry has countered with alternative methods of compensation, such as
allowing the government to take a percentage of the raw material and sell the
oil itself. Deal said the current proposed rule is salvageable if the formula is
changed to more reflect the value of oil recovered at the wellhead.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think the MMS proposal departs from the statute, we think the MMS
proposal departs from the lease contracts, we think the MMS proposal will lead
to a value greater than the value of production and lead to unlawfully high
royalties," Deal said. "That's the core of it."
</P>
<P>
	   The Minerals Management Service estimates the new formula will generate an
extra $66 million annually over the approximately $3.5 billion the government
takes in each year on oil and gas leases, mainly in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   The industry has not determined how much the rule will cost, Deal said, but
he believes it would far exceed the agency's figure.

<HEADLINE> Veterans Less Likely To Be Jailed  </HEADLINE>
   By G. STEPHEN BIERMAN JR. Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the best ways to stay out of jail may be to join
the military, according to a government study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Male military veterans have less than half the rate of incarceration than
those who have never served in the armed forces, according to the study from the
Bureau of Justice Statistics, a division of the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
	   An average 937 male veterans are in jail or prison per 100,000 veteran
residents, compared to an average 1,971 men incarcerated per 100,000
non-veterans.
</P>
<P>
	   The study focused solely on men, who comprise 95 percent of the nation's
veterans and was based on interviews with selected inmates on their military,
criminal and personal backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the report indicated that veterans are less likely to go to jail or
prison, the same statistics show veterans who are imprisoned are more likely
than the non-veteran inmates to have committed violent crimes. Roughly 35
percent of the veterans surveyed in state prisons had been convicted of homicide
or sexual assault, compared to 20 percent of the rest of the inmate population,
said the study.
</P>
<P>
	   Among state prisoners sentenced for violent crimes, the average sentence of
veterans was 50 months longer than that of the average non-veteran, the study
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Participants were designated as veterans whether or not they actually were
engaged in combat. In other words, a veteran was defined as a male who served in
the military during the period of a war or conflict, such as during the Vietnam
era.
</P>
<P>
	   Veterans who actually saw combat during their service had less serious
criminal histories than other veterans, according to the report. And half of the
incarcerated veterans in the study had served during a period of wartime; 35
percent were Vietnam-era veterans and 12 percent were Gulf War-era veterans.
Twenty percent had seen combat during their military service.
</P>
<P>
	   The bureau also reported:
</P>
<P>
	   --Veterans were less likely to be serving a sentence for a drug conviction
-- 14 percent -- than other inmates -- 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   -- About 70 percent of the veterans had been working full-time prior to
state imprisonment, compared to 54 percent of the other state prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   --Among state prisoners, 12 percent of the veterans and 10 percent of the
non-veterans said they had been homeless at some time during the year before
their arrest.

<HEADLINE> Arrests in Alleged Cocaine Service  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A delivery service that made cocaine ``as easy to order as
pizza'' led to the indictment of 10 men accused of catering their drug trade to
upper-class professionals in prime Manhattan neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Cocaine distribution and use is destructive of society, especially when it
becomes as easy to order as pizza,'' U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of names, addresses and telephone numbers of customers in numerous
residential buildings on the Upper East Side, the Upper West Side, Chelsea and
Soho were listed with the service, authorities said. The organization also
allegedly delivered to restaurants and bars.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the deliveries were in small amounts ranging from half a gram to 3
grams, court papers showed.
</P>
<P>
	   After an order was placed, a delivery person posing as a livery cab driver
would meet the customer at a prearranged location, sometimes the residence of
the customer, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
	   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for White, wouldn't comment on whether
prosecutors were pursuing the customers but said the investigation is
continuing.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the defendants were being held without bail. Two others were awaiting
court appearances and the others had not yet been arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted, each defendant faces a mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison
and a maximum of life in prison with no parole on conspiracy and drug
distribution charges.

<HEADLINE> Russia Predicts Better US Relations  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia's acting president, Vladimir Putin, is modern and
pragmatic and will maintain good relations with the United States and the West,
said a senior Russian government adviser who was predecessor Boris Yeltsin's
chief spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   In a frank discussion at the National Press Club, former journalist Dmitry
Yakushkin acknowledged that Yeltsin was so irritated by President Clinton's
position on Kosovo that he sometimes avoided talking with him.
</P>
<P>
	   He said relations with Putin should be better, although he predicted the
Chechen crisis would take years to resolve.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We won't have any hawkish declarations,'' he said, seeing relations under
Putin as ``much more calm, much more pragmatic, much more workmanlike in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This will be a more predictable, more reliable country,'' Yakushkin said,
adding that Russians are acutely aware of the economic and political problems
that grip their nation and are trying to solve them. ``I don't see any hint of
possible future confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yakushkin, a deputy to Putin chief of staff Alexander Voloshin, said he
expects no major economic measures to be announced by Putin before the March 26
presidential election he is expected to win easily.
</P>
<P>
	   Yakushkin described Yeltsin as a dominant figure during his time in office,
but discounted rumors of continuing Yeltsin influence over the Russian
government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no double center of power,'' Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that Putin's firm stand on Chechnya underpins his popularity among
Russians, who view leaders of the Chechen rebellion as outlaws. He said final
resolution of the crisis will take ``not months, but years,'' possibly including
strong rule from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Maybe it needs dictatorship,'' he said, explaining afterwards that he
meant only that tough measures must be taken to impose order, discipline and the
rule of law on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Yakushkin said he planned no official meetings while in the United States
for Putin's government but was here to get the views of private American
analysts, journalists and others on the new Russian government.

<HEADLINE> Court OKs Good Fri. School Closings  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court is letting Maryland require public
schools to close on Good Friday, but the legitimacy of that law and Good Friday
laws in more than a dozen states remains clouded.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices, acting without comment Tuesday, rejected an appeal in which a
retired Maryland teacher said the school-closings law violates constitutionally
required separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
	   In separate action, the nation's highest court turned away appeals by
Quakers who say the Internal Revenue Service violates their religious freedom by
charging fees and interest for delays in paying the portion of their federal tax
that funds the military.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the states with Good Friday laws, only Maryland, Illinois and North
Dakota require all public schools to close on that day each year. A federal
appeals court struck down the Illinois law.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices still have before them a challenge to an Indiana law
designating Good Friday a state holiday. They have not yet said whether they
will grant full review to that dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not going away,'' said Dwight Sullivan, an American Civil
Liberties Union lawyer in Baltimore. ``You have the Constitution being applied
differently in different states.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Maryland law ``sends the message to non-Christians that the state finds
Good Friday, and thus Christianity, to be a religion worth honoring while their
religion or nonreligion is not of equal importance,'' contended an appeal by
former teacher Judith Koenick.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That message is particularly significant in this case because it is being
sent to schoolchildren,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lower courts rejected her argument. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
said the long weekend's legitimate purpose is to avoid anticipated high
absenteeism among teachers and students on the days surrounding Easter, the
holiest of Christian holidays.
</P>
<P>
	   Good Friday, always two days before Easter Sunday, commemorates the
crucifixion of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
	   Montgomery County schools also are closed on Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of
Atonement, and the first day of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year. Those policy
decisions are based not on anticipated absenteeism but on findings that large
numbers of students would be absent if schools were open on those days.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryland law does not require school closings for any Jewish holiday. State
law designates these public school holidays: Thanksgiving and the day after;
Christmas Eve through Jan. 1; the Friday before Easter through the Monday after;
Memorial Day; and primary and general election days.
</P>
<P>
	   State and federal courts are divided, the justices were told, over the
constitutionality of laws or governmental practices that deal with Good Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Ms. Koenick urged the court ``to bring order to the lower
courts' chaotic decisions concerning governmental recognition of Good Friday.''
</P>
<P>
	   But lawyers for the Montgomery County Board of Education said the four-day
holiday ``is anchored around the increasingly secularized holiday of Easter,
which is a traditional time for Marylanders, like many other Americans, to begin
Easter-related travel.''
</P>
<P>
	   The justices were told that 12 states have Good Friday laws: Delaware,
Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, North
Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. Wisconsin had such a law,
but it was ruled unconstitutional in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   California and Kentucky have laws establishing part of Good Friday as a
holiday for government employees, and in Texas the day is an ``optional
holiday'' for state employees.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Quakers' case, the court turned away arguments by three Religious
Society of Friends members from New England and Pennsylvania. The action let the
IRS continue charging late fees and interest in addition to their back taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals filed on behalf of Gordon and Edith Browne, who have homes in
New Hampshire and Vermont, and Priscilla Lippincott Adams of Philadelphia did
not contest having to pay 100 percent of their tax bill when the tax agency
forces their hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the Quakers cited a ``religious hardship'' and argued that they
should be able to pay the back taxes without any penalties or interest.
</P>
<P>
	   They said that as a result of religious faith and study, they cannot
voluntarily pay that portion of their federal income taxes which they determine
are dedicated to war and war-related activities.
</P>
<P>
	   In rejecting those arguments, lower courts relied on a 1982 Supreme Court
decision that said, ``The tax system could not function if denominations were
allowed to challenge (it) because tax payments were spent in a manner that
violates their religious belief.''

<HEADLINE> Teacher Union Urges Higher Wages  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM IRWIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- The president of the American Federation of Teachers
on Tuesday called for dramatically higher salaries to help counter an
anticipated shortage of up to 2.5 million teachers over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ultimately we need to make teaching a more attractive and lucrative career
for young people,'' Sandra Feldman told reporters before addressing The Economic
Club of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
	   A June 1999 survey by the nation's second-largest teacher union found that
beginning teachers made $25,735 on average in 1997-98, compared with $42,862 for
new engineering graduates and $40,920 for new computer scientists.
</P>
<P>
	   The national average salary for all teachers in the 1997-98 school year was
$39,347, according to the union.
</P>
<P>
	   In other professional fields, lawyers earned $71,530, engineers made $64,489
and computer systems analysts drew an average paycheck of $63,072.
</P>
<P>
	   Money aside, young college graduates are not looking at teaching as a career
choice because of concerns about safety, opportunities for advancement and the
public perception of teachers, Ms. Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most young people feel teaching doesn't have the status they want,'' the
former New York City classroom teacher said. ``You're not going to be able to
staff the schools of America with missionaries.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 1 million-member union also supports peer review as a condition of
receiving tenure; and modifying decades-old salary schedules based mainly on
years of experience and levels of education.

<HEADLINE> Bitter Cold Hammers Northeast  </HEADLINE>
   By LUKAS I. ALPERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Nose-numbing, lip-chapping cold gripped the eastern United
States for a second straight day Tuesday, closing schools, delaying trains and
actually making workers eager to get into the warm confines of their offices.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wish I could find a way to get home without going outside,'' said
Jeanette Cordero, who bundled up for a smoking break outside New York's Paine
Webber building.
</P>
<P>
	   In a whiplash reversal of conditions that were practically balmy a week ago,
New York City's temperatures hovered in the mid-teens with the wind chill
gusting to 10 below at Kennedy Airport. At Enosburg Falls, in northern Vermont,
temperatures dipped to 38 below zero.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yup, we're a little cool up here,'' said Carolyn Stimpson, town clerk of
Enosburg Falls, population 2,535. ``It's hard to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
	   Farther south, winter caused school and business closings or delays in North
Carolina, South Carolina and West Virginia. The eastern part of North Carolina
was blasted by 6 inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Maine, which often contends for the appellation of coldest place in the
continental United States, reported 21 below zero with no wind at Allagash and 4
below with a minus 35 wind chill factor in Bangor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a bone chiller,'' said Art Lester from the National Weather Service
in Gray, Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   A homeless man in New York was found dead on a loading dock Monday, when the
temperature was 19 with a wind chill of minus 16. The medical examiner said
Tuesday he apparently had died of exposure.
</P>
<P>
	   Another New York man described by police as homeless was found dead in the
backseat of a car he had apparently crawled into. An autopsy was to be performed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Freezing temperatures spell ``terrifying times for the homeless,'' said Mary
Brosnahan, director of New York's Coalition for the Homeless. ``There are lot of
people fighting for their lives.''
</P>
<P>
	   More than 6,800 people stayed in homeless shelters Monday night, said
Mitchell Netburn, first deputy commissioner of New York City's Department of
Homeless Services. The system was 700 beds below capacity, Netburn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Having a home didn't always ensure warmth. The city received 3,919 calls on
Monday reporting inadequate or lack of heat; its hot line usually averages 2,000
calls per week.
</P>
<P>
	   And forecasts call for below-freezing temperatures throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
	   That's bad news for Ar Khan, who is outside for 14 hours a day running a
magazine stand near Grand Central Terminal. ``It's absolutely painful,'' he
said, ``but I have to be out here.''

<HEADLINE> Consumers Paying Debt More Quickly  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Personal bankruptcy rates are coming down from historic
highs as many consumers have sped up repayment of their credit card debts, a
consumer group said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Consumer Federation of America said 112,000 fewer people filed for and
received bankruptcy court protection last year than in 1998. That's an 8 percent
drop to under 1.3 million that the federation termed the largest one-year
decline on record.
</P>
<P>
	   More cautious borrowing by consumers is at the heart of the decrease, the
federation said, saying that has forced credit card companies to restrain their
solicitations and lures. For the first time in a decade, the group said, credit
card lenders have curbed the expansion of credit lines, or limits, offered to
their customers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Consumers have increasingly just said 'no' to credit card solicitations,"
Stephen Brobeck, executive director of Consumer Federation, said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   While 2.8 percent of consumers accepted unsolicited offers of new credit
cards in 1992, that dropped to 1 percent in January-September 1999, Brobeck
said.
</P>
<P>
	   And lenders have reduced the number of solicitations. They mailed an
estimated 2.4 billion credit card solicitations in the first nine months of last
year, compared with 3.5 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Brobeck said, many consumers with credit card debts have
realized the importance of paying more than the minimum required on their
monthly bills. They are sending heftier payments as well as defaulting less
frequently on their debts, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The data were released a week before the Senate is scheduled to resume
debate on major bipartisan legislation, pushed by credit card companies and
retail businesses, that would make it tougher for people to erase their debts in
bankruptcy court. The House approved parallel legislation last May by a
veto-proof margin, 313-108.
</P>
<P>
	   Proponents of the legislation have said it was needed to stanch a rising
tide of personal bankruptcies that had occurred despite the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Brobeck and other Consumer Federation officials said that given the decline
in personal bankruptcies, the legislation was overly harsh and not needed.
</P>
<P>
	   But the banking industry and lawmakers who support the legislation say that
even with the decline, personal bankruptcies remain at historic high levels and
legislation is needed to prevent abuse of the bankruptcy process by some
consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of Americans filing personal bankruptcies in 1998, at nearly 1.4
million, was up more than 300 percent from 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, a key author of the bankruptcy legislation,
called the recent decline in filings a slight change and insisted that a
"bankruptcy crisis" still exists.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the decrease in filings from 1998 to 1999 should be viewed in the
context of an unusually high level of bankruptcies in 1998, "in part because of
aggressive marketing by bankruptcy lawyers who pressed unwitting consumers to
file" before passage of the new legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's good news that consumers are showing restraint," said Patricia
Boerger, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association. She added, however,
that the recent decline does not ensure a long-term trend.
</P>
<P>
	   "The reality is that the current bankruptcy (law) is broken," Ms. Boerger
said. "It allows people who can afford to pay their debts to walk away."
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, she said, credit card lenders are forced to raise rates for
responsible consumers, costing households an average $400 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The group's data are based in part on a new study by economist Lawrence
Ausubel, an economics professor at the University of Maryland, whose figures
indicate personal bankruptcies declined to 1,285,800 last year from 1,397,700 in
1998, down 8 percent. The drop continued last year, he found.
</P>
<P>
	   Figures released last year by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts,
which oversees bankruptcy judges, among others, also showed a decline. For
example, they showed personal bankruptcies declining 2 percent during the 12
months ended June 30, 1999, the first yearly decrease since 1995.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former CIA Director Adm. Stansfield Turner is being
treated at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio after a weekend plane crash
in Costa Rica that killed his wife, a family spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Turner's condition is listed as ``critical but stable,'' said the spokesman,
Charles Battaglia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's doing a little better today,'' Battaglia said. He said Turner remains
in an ``induced coma'' to remove pressure from broken ribs.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been no decision yet on surgery, Battaglia said.
</P>
<P>
	   Turner was flown from Costa Rica to Texas on Monday aboard a private air
ambulance.
</P>
<P>
	   Turner, 76, is a retired admiral who served as CIA director under President

<HEADLINE> Michael J. Fox Leaving 'Spin City'  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- "Spin City" star Michael J. Fox said Tuesday he is
leaving the ABC sitcom, but not show business, because of his fight against
Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox, who revealed in 1998 that he suffers from the degenerative neurological
disorder that affects movement, said this will be his last season with the
highly rated series.
</P>
<P>
	   "I could not be more proud of the show ... and all that we have accomplished
over the last four years, yet I feel that right now my time and energy would be
better spent with my family and working toward a cure for Parkinson's disease,"
the 38-year-old actor said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This does not mean I am retiring from acting, producing or directing, only
that I want to relieve the strain of producing and performing a weekly network
series," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC, which had no comment on the show's future, called "Spin City" a "labor
of love" for Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clearly there are more important things in life and we wish Michael and his
family our heartfelt thanks and support," the network said. "We look forward to
working with Michael in his future endeavors."
</P>
<P>
	   Fox, who is up for a Golden Globe award Sunday, plays a hard-charging deputy
mayor on the series now in its fourth year. His co-stars include Barry Bostwick
and Heather Locklear, who joined the cast this season.
</P>
<P>
	   The former star of the sitcom "Family Ties" and the "Back to the Future"
movies told of his incurable illness in the December 1998 issue of People
magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   He decided to reveal his affliction because he thought he could help his
family and other sufferers of the disease. Fox has three children, a son and
twin daughters, with actress Tracy Pollan.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1991, Fox noticed a "twitch" in the little finger on his left hand while
on the set of the film "Doc Hollywood." Although a doctor told him he could
function for many years, the disease progressed and he suffered stiffness in his
entire left side and violent tremors.

<HEADLINE> DEA: Cocaine Production Grows  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- Bolivia and Peru are significantly cutting down on
cocaine production, but output of the illicit drug is increasing in Colombia,
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombia is expected to produce 330 to 440 tons of pure cocaine this year,
compared to 220 tons last year, according to a written report prepared by DEA
agents in Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
	   Increased cocaine production is directly linked to greater acreage devoted
to growing coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   In Colombia, coca fields now cover 222,000 acres of land, compared with
81,000 acres in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Peru is expected to produce 192 tons of cocaine this year, compared to 264
tons in 1998 and 606 tons in 1992, the DEA said. Coca leaf cultivation has
dropped from 283,000 acres to 85,000 acres in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Bolivia produced 248 tons of cocaine in 1992. Last year, the figure dropped
to 77 tons and is expected to drop further to 55 tons this year, the DEA said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bolivia's coca acreage has dropped through a forceful eradication program,
dropping from 100,000 acres a few years ago to less than half that today. A
record 35,000 acres were eradicated last year alone.
</P>
<P>
	   The production of opium, from which heroin is produced, is also in the rise
in Colombia. The country has gone from zero production a decade ago to becoming
a major producer, much of it earmarked for U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Bolivian President Hugo Banzer has vowed to get all of Bolivia out of
illegal coca leaf growing and cocaine production before his five-year term ends
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   In Colombia, meanwhile, the United States is carrying out a program to
defeat Colombian drug traffickers by helping to train up to 3,000 military
personnel and 500 police officers before the end of the year, U.S. officials
say.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton's administration has announced a two-year, $1.6 billion
program to assist in the anti-drug fight and help Colombia in other ways.

<HEADLINE> Whitman vetoes bill that would have granted infertile couples  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman on Tuesday vetoed a bill that
would have required health insurers to cover infertility treatments.
<P>
	   The bill was pitched by lawmakers who said couples having trouble conceiving
must also cope with big medical bills from treatments that can cost thousands of
dollars. Insurance companies said the bill would drive up the cost of medical
insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman said in her veto message she is "concerned about the impact this
legislation might have on the overall cost of health insurance."
</P>
<P>
	   The governor said advocates and opponents had a wildly different view of how
much mandating infertility treatment coverage would cost. Whitman said she will
seek a cost estimate from a task force she set up last summer to study the cost
and availability of health care in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would be imprudent for me to approve this bill without first receiving
input from the task force," Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill, S-773, gained final legislative approval last Monday, just prior
to the end of the 208th Legislature. Because it passed so late in the session,
Whitman's veto will stand. Lawmakers in the 209th Legislature can, however, can
introduce a new bill.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're certainly disappointed," said Deborah Wachenheim, government affairs
director for Boston-based Resolve, The National Infertility Organization. "I
think this bill certainly would have helped a lot of couples in New Jersey get
access to treatment that they need. We were hopeful the governor would go along
with the trend of providing insurance coverage for couples struggling to build
families."
</P>
<P>
	   The bill would have required employers and other groups with 50 or more
members to cover infertility treatments if the medical insurance they offer
includes pregnancy-related benefits. An estimated 535,000 New Jerseyans are
infertile, according to Resolve.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure would have targeted a wide range of treatments, including
expensive in vitro fertilization in which an egg is fertilized outside the
uterus and then implanted. But insurers would have also had the option to
require patients to try less expansive treatments before being eligible for the
costly high-tech procedures.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill stipulated that a woman under 35 would have to try to conceive for
two years before being considered infertile and eligible for benefits. Women
over 35 would have to fail to conceive for one year before being eligible.
</P>
<P>
	   Wachenheim said 13 states currently require at least some health insurance
coverage of infertility treatments. She said the New Jersey legislation "would
have been one of the stronger ones in the country."
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents and supporters of the bill differed on the question of cost.
Wachenheim said studies showed the cost to be only about $3 per insurance plan
each year. Paul Langevin, president of the New Jersey Association of Health
Plans, said it could fatten health care bills by 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our opposition to the bill isn't a value judgment about people who are
having difficulty having kids," Langevin said. "It's a value judgment about what
you require should be included in every single health insurance policy in the
state. By increasing the cost of policies, you deny health insurance to more and
more people."

<HEADLINE> Indian Protesters Reach Quito  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Slipping by military highway patrols, thousands of
highland Indian protesters, including women and children in ragged clothing,
reached the capital Tuesday as the to demand the resignation of embattled
President Jamil Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
	   The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador, which represents
the country's 4 million Indians, has organized what it calls an ``indigenous
uprising,'' which includes blockading highways and a march on Quito by at least
10,000 Indians.
</P>
<P>
	   After sleeping and resting most of the day at a park near the downtown, some
5,000 Indians marched peacefully toward Congress, located two blocks away, but
were turned back by police barricades.
</P>
<P>
	   They continued their march along nearby streets, chanting anti-Mahuad
slogans in Spanish and the Quichua Indian language, before returning to the
park.
</P>
<P>
	   Indian leaders have set Wednesday as the day of the symbolic ``capture'' of
Quito, Ecuador's capital, by thousands of Indian protesters. Leaders at one
point had said 40,000 Indians would take part but have since scaled back the
figure to 10,000.
</P>
<P>
	   They are demanding Mahuad's resignation, accusing him of failing to end
Ecuador's economic crisis, including a 60 percent inflation rate, the highest in
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indians also say Mahuad should go because of his plan to make the U.S.
dollar Ecuador's official currency in a bid to halt inflation and stabilize the
economy. Their leaders charge the step will impoverish even further the 7
million poor people in Ecuador's population of 12 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The government deployed 35,000 soldiers and police to patrol the country's
major highways to block Indians who live in isolated highland villages from
reaching Quito.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the patrols by security forces, hundreds of Indians appeared at dawn
Tuesday in Quito, located 9,400 feet high in the Andes, and began gathering at a
large park near downtown. Throughout the day they continued to filter into the
park in small groups.
</P>
<P>
	   An Indian leader, who refused to give his name, said the Indians from his
village had walked all night through the mountains, avoiding highways.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have come to Quito to stay until Jamil goes back to his home,'' the
leader said.
</P>
<P>
	   Indians from other mountain villages said they had arrived on buses and had
managed to get by military blockades by telling soldiers they were on their way
to towns near the capital to attend religious festivals and other events.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indians who gathered in El Arbolito park, 20 blocks from the government
palace, included men, women and children in tattered clothing and ponchos.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday groups of Indians blocked highways in eight of Ecuador's 22
provinces, the latest in a series of anti-Mahuad protests. Security forces
quickly cleared the roads without violence.
</P>
<P>
	   The government on Jan. 5 declared a state of emergency, empowering the armed
forces to control the growing public protests.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Court Rules Vs. Roadblocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Setting up roadblocks to check for people possessing illegal
drugs violates the Massachusetts Constitution, the state's highest court ruled
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Judicial Court ruled unanimously in a case that involved a
temporary drug roadblock set up by police in Holyoke in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors argued that drug roadblocks were constitutional because they are
similar to checkpoints set up to check whether people are driving drunk. But the
court said there were crucial distinctions between the two types of roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
	   The court said sobriety checkpoints are intended to remove a deadly and
immediate menace from the road and are a ``minimal and focused intrusion'' on
motorists.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug roadblocks are generalized searches to discover evidence of criminal
activity, without probable cause or reasonable suspicion, the court said.
</P>
<P>
	   The court upheld a lower court ruling that threw out evidence found in a
search of a man's car in Holyoke on Nov. 21, 1997. Hector Rodriguez is facing
charges of possessing marijuana and operating with a suspended license.

<HEADLINE> Texas Fires Attributed to Protest  </HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN HAWKINS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RANGER, Texas (AP) -- Twelve fires were set overnight in this small old oil
boom town, and the police chief said they might have been related to a protest
against his no-tolerance policy on drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Several people peacefully demonstrated at City Hall on Monday night to air
their complaints against Police Chief Tom Million, who said he's cracked down on
drug manufacturing and sales in this town of 2,800 since taking office a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had a large number of individuals that we had arrested on drug charges,
and they were picketing, wanting me to resign and leave town,'' Million said.
``The City Council would take no action on that, and once that was all over is
when the fires started breaking out.''
</P>
<P>
	   The first fire was reported about 7:20 p.m., before the City Council had
adjourned but after it had refused to take any action against Million.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the night was over, eight vacant houses and a barn filled with about
$150,000 worth of hay had burned. Three small grass fires were also reported
around Ranger, which is 85 miles west of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've been here all of my life, and I've never seen anything like this,''
said Manuel Hernandez, 73. ``There was a protest at City Hall, somebody got mad
and started these fires.''
</P>
<P>
	   Three of the burned vacant houses could be seen from the small house
Hernandez and his wife have lived in for 38 years. One of the fires was directly
across the street and caused the vinyl siding on their home to melt and peel
back, even as he cooled it with water from a hose.
</P>
<P>
	   Fire Chief Darrell Fox said all of the fires, as many as four of which were
burning at one time, appeared to have been deliberately set.
</P>
<P>
	   Everyone in town had an idea of who was to blame, but no arrests had been
made Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Don Adams, whose barn was still burning Tuesday, said he's sure it was a
deliberate target because of its location, on a hill near Interstate 20.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was retaliation to Ranger,'' Adams said. ``Everybody around here
knows everybody; there's nothing accidental here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Rains, an investigator with the Eastland County Sheriff's Department,
said three sets of motorcycle tire tracks led up to the barn, then away.
</P>
<P>
	   Million said police patrols would be increased, with the help of state
troopers. He also said the fires would not change his crime strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they honestly believe that this is going to stop our war on drugs, it's
not,'' Million said.

<HEADLINE> Getting Out the Vote in Iowa  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- This has become a city of ``boiler rooms,'' filled
with tables, coffee-stained lists and volunteers appealing to people over the
phone to turn out for Monday's caucuses, the first voting of the 2000
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Organized labor, which has thrown its support behind Al Gore, is running an
intense turnout effort by phone and mail. Bill Bradley's got his own phone banks
-- and former pro basketball teammates joining in to help.
</P>
<P>
	   Publisher Steve Forbes, who's chasing GOP front-runner George W. Bush, is
offering Iowa supporters rides to precinct sites -- come rain, sleet or snow.
Bush has got precinct ``captains'' running through phone trees of friends,
neighbors and anyone else they can urge to show up Monday night at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   After the candidates have made their points for months, telephone banks are
humming, mailboxes are being flooded and doors pounded as everyone tries to
deliver their backers to the 2,131 precinct caucuses. Rather than voting in a
traditional primary, a candidate's supporters must show up at a neighborhood
meeting prepared to argue with friends and neighbors about politics, and to
choose delegates to the national conventions.
</P>
<P>
	   Old-fashioned shoe leather and long hours are at a premium.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not rocket science,'' said Michael Whouley, a Boston-based
consultant organizing the state for Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   In some cases it almost seems like it.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharon Dearden helps oversee a turnout operation at the Iowa Federation of
Labor, which is seeking to deliver union members for Gore. In addition to the
basics like making 30,000 telephone calls, the labor effort mailed 1,300
packages to local union offices.
</P>
<P>
	   In that mailing, the local business agent gets to pick a turnout letter from
several choices and signs an attached card. The central labor body then
reproduces the letter over the local leader's signature in personalized mailings
to all 150,000 union households in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is hardly watching idly by, said spokesman Jim Farrell. About 400
volunteers are working the state, and phone banks will make about 25,000 calls
on Bradley's behalf, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prominent surrogates like Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey and former Labor
Secretary Robert Reich are joined on the campaign trail by former basketball
great Willis Reed.
</P>
<P>
	   Former teammate and coaching legend Phil Jackson joins in on Bradley's Web
site, which walks newcomers through the complicated caucus procedures and points
them to the gathering for their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've been using the Internet very creatively,'' said Farrell. ``Gore has
all the establishment power so we have to go directly to the people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has plenty of surrogates, too. Three Cabinet officers are in the state
this week, along with Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry. For good measure,
consultant James Carville added his pitch in eastern Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   With five active campaigns on the GOP side, there's plenty of action for
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman Eric Woolson said the Bush turnout operation is based on an
elaborate phone tree in which staffers are assigned precinct captains, who in
turn have identified lists of friends and neighbors they are responsible for
getting to the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've got captains in about 90 percent of the precincts,'' said Woolson.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes is running second in most Iowa polls, and consultant Bob Haus is
organizing a major turnout operation for the well-financed campaign. ``There's
support out there for Forbes and we're going to see that they get to a caucus,
regardless of the weather,'' said Haus. ``We're asking people if they want a
ride to the caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
	   Haus said the campaign has made tens of thousands of telephone calls, and
Forbes himself was bolstering the effort with a showy bus tour.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a lot of effort for a relatively few folks. Most estimates place
turnout at about 100,000 for each party.
</P>
<P>
	   Not everyone is pushing a candidate. AARP for instance, wants people to show
up at caucuses to introduce resolutions on issues like protecting Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
	   So even though 66-year-old Doris Sherer hasn't decided which candidate to
back, every morning she shows up at a suburban office and works the phones.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I enjoy volunteering,'' she said. ``It's a good way to give something back
to a community that's been good to me. It's important for people to know what's
going on.''
</P>
<P>
	   The AARP effort will include 90,000 pieces of mail and 50,000 telephone
calls, said John McCalley, who is running things.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, about 2,000 kits with instructions on introducing resolutions
were mailed to senior activists who have pledged to go to a caucus.
</P>
<P>
	   On a smaller scale, a group called Iowans for Sensible Priorities wants
people to go to caucuses and support the group's call for a 15 percent cut in
defense spending.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We sent out a 12,000-piece mailing with our resolution in it, and we're
following up with phone banking,'' said spokeswoman Peggy Huppert.

<HEADLINE> Major announcement expected in 1975 murder of Greenwich teen-ager  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - More than 24 years after a Greenwich teen-ager
was found beaten to death with a golf club on her family's estate, prosecutors
are ready to release the results of a grand jury investigation that focused on a
nephew of Robert F. Kennedy as the suspect.
<P>
	   On Tuesday, prosecutors refused to reveal the outcome of the investigation
into the death of 15-year-old Martha Moxley or to say whether Michael Skakel,
the chief suspect, would be arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   A news conference was scheduled for 9 a.m. Wednesday, when Bridgeport
State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict was expected to release a report from
Superior Court Judge George Thim, who has investigated the case for the last 18
months as a one-man grand jury.
</P>
<P>
	   In his report, Thim was expected to say whether he found probable cause for
an arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   Thim's investigation focused on Skakel, who at the time of the killing was a
15-year-old neighbor of Moxley's. Skakel is the son of Rushton Skakel Sr., who
is the brother of Ethel Kennedy, the widow of U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
	   On the night of her death, Oct. 30, 1975, Ms. Moxley had visited the Skakel
home, along with several other teen-agers after a night of pre-Halloween pranks.
Her body was found the next day under some low-hanging fir trees on her family's
estate, located across the street from the Skakel estate.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after the killing, the 6-iron used to kill her was matched to a set
owned by the Skakel family. But no one was ever arrested in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Michael Skakel, and his older brother Thomas Skakel, then 17, were
looked at possible suspects, along with others, including Kenneth Littleton, a
tutor who had just moved into the Skakel house the day of the killing.
</P>
<P>
	   After more than two decades of dead ends, Thim was appointed as a grand
juror in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Once Thim began calling witnesses, it quickly became clear that Michael
Skakel was the focus of the probe, even though the proceedings are held in
secret.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors filed court documents in which they claimed Skakel had made
"admissions as to the murder of Martha Moxley" when he lived at a school and
substance abuse treatment center from 1978 to 1980. Prosecutors said he made the
admissions to fellow students at the Elan school in Poland Spring, Maine. Thim
heard testimony from former students at the school behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
	   Littleton was eliminated as a suspect after he was granted immunity from
prosecution in August 1998, after he testified before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Skakel's lawyer, Michael Sherman, said Skakel, now 39, continues to
maintain his innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   "Regardless of the grand jury's recommendations or actions, he has been and
will continue to be innocent of any wrongdoing here," Sherman said late Tuesday.
"He's obviously very anxious about having this matter resolved, and he's looking
forward to being exonerated, whether it be tomorrow or sometime after that."
</P>
<P>
	   Thim's 18-month investigation ended on Dec. 10. He had 60 days from that
date to file his written report.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors are not bound by Thim's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview last month, Benedict said that even if Thim recommended an
arrest, prosecutors could have a long way to go to win a conviction at trial.
</P>
<P>
	   "Probable cause is a threshold decision, at best," Benedict said. "We don't,
as a rule, decide to prosecute merely on a finding of probable cause because
we're fully aware we have a much stronger burden of proof."
</P>
<P>
	   Martha's mother, Dorthy Moxley, said prosecutors had informed her of the
news conference, but would not tell her whether they plan to seek an arrest
warrant for Skakel.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am hopeful," she said. "I have prayed for this for so long."

<HEADLINE> White House Notebook  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- White House spokesman Joe Lockhart made good on a bargain
Tuesday when he traded jobs with the guy on his staff who has perhaps the least
enviable assignment -- the daily herding of the traveling press corps.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart, the president's chief spokesman and a longtime Clinton aide,
usually has a seat on the president's helicopter and rides near the head of the
presidential motorcade. He has plenty of that elusive Washington commodity
called ``access.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday he was more like a glorified hall monitor as he organized and
ushered the small group of reporters who travel with Clinton at all times. The
job punctuates brief bursts of near-mayhem, such as when Clinton dives into a
crowd to shake hands and the cameras try to follow, with long periods of tedium
as the press corps waits for Clinton to leave a place or arrive in another.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart said he proposed the swap as an inducement to his staff to
contribute to charity. Everyone who contributed got a chance to have the boss
fill in for him or her.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We went from very low participation to nearly full participation very
quickly,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the press office staff made sure the fix was in. Everyone who
participated in the bargain put the same name in the hat -- that of press
wrangler Mark Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though Lockhart was a press wrangler for former presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis in 1984, he was a little rusty. Bernstein was on hand Tuesday
morning to give Lockhart a few pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- President Clinton says he's trying to lose about 10 pounds,
but he didn't stick with his diet Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   After a speech in Boston's Roxbury section, Clinton's motorcade stopped
nearby in the funky South End for ham, eggs, toast, grits and cornbread at a
lunch counter called Mike's City Diner. The restaurant's motto: Huge portions,
great food.
</P>
<P>
	   When a restaurant patron, Aidan McDonnell, offered Clinton a french fry
doused in ketchup, the president accepted, and scooped a fry off McDonnell's
plate.
</P>
<P>
	   As Clinton settled in at a table in the back with Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, McDonnell marveled at the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I never thought he was so hungry,'' said McDonnell, of West Roxbury.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the most exciting lunch I've ever had, to meet the president,''
McDonnell said.
</P>
<P>
	   After cleaning his plate, Clinton announced: ``I need a nap.''

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A hotel worker accused of gunning down four co-workers,
then fatally shooting a fifth person while trying to escape, pleaded innocent
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Silvio Izquierdo-Leyva, 36, pleaded innocent to five counts of first-degree
murder and to seven counts of attempted first-degree murder during his

<HEADLINE> Ill. Beating Victim Visits Attacker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A 16-year-old black teen-ager beaten into a coma by white
youths in 1997 has visited one of his attackers in prison, even posing for a
photograph with him.
</P>
<P>
	   Lenard Clark, who was 13 when the racially motivated beating occurred, and
his mother have visited Frank Caruso Jr. more than once, corrections spokesman
Nic Howell confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chicago Sun-Times ran a photo Tuesday of a smiling Clark next to Caruso
in the prison where Caruso is serving eight years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are a lot of people who debunk the whole Lenard Clark-Caruso
relationship, but what's the alternative? Do we continue to hate?'' said Dominic
DiFrisco, a friend of Caruso's father.
</P>
<P>
	   Caruso's attorney, Edward Genson said Caruso's parents have become friends
with Clark's mother, Wanda McMurray. Genson has discouraged Caruso from talking
to the media and Clark's mother wouldn't comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark was bicycling in a white neighborhood at the time of the beating and
continues to suffer brain damage as a result of the attack. Prosecutors say race
was the sole motive. President Clinton condemned the beating in a national
address.
</P>
<P>
	   Caruso was 19 when he was sentenced. Two others pleaded guilty and received
probation.

<HEADLINE> Regulators Issue Advisory on Banks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal banking regulators warned Tuesday that some banks
and other credit card lenders could be indirectly increasing their financial
risk when they fail to report customers' credit lines to credit bureaus.
</P>
<P>
	   The warning came in an advisory letter from federal banking agencies to the
heads of the nation's banks, savings and loans and credit unions. The letter
also stated that some financial institutions have not reported to credit bureaus
any mortgage or other loan information on subprime borrowers, who have inferior
credit histories and therefore pay higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators have expressed concern that subprime borrowers who make payments
on time could unfairly be charged higher interest rates when they seek credit in
the future because their credit records don't include information showing their
responsible prior payments.
</P>
<P>
	   The lack of reporting is not illegal, and regulations regarding data
reported to credit bureaus are open to interpretation. But the Federal Financial
Institutions Examination Council warned in the letter that incomplete credit
bureau information provided, in turn, to banks can cause them to make incorrect
lending decisions and can hurt their financial soundness.
</P>
<P>
	   "Institutions that do not modify their credit risk-management processes to
compensate for omitted data in credit bureau reports could inadvertently expose
themselves to increased credit risk," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
	   The regulators have been concerned about the practice for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The credit card lenders that omit customers' credit lines from their reports
to credit bureaus account for about one-half of the U.S. market for MasterCard
and Visa, according to regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke Jr., who oversees nationally
chartered banks, told bankers in a speech last June that while failure to report
the data is not illegal, "it can readily be characterized as unfair, it may well
be deceptive and -- in any context -- it's abusive."
</P>
<P>
	   Congress also has looked into the matter, Hawke noted.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council is made up of the
Federal Reserve; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.; the comptroller's office,
which is part of the Treasury Department; the Office of Thrift Supervision and
the National Credit Union Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   In a related move Tuesday, the American Financial Services Association, an
industry group representing mortgage and finance companies as well as retailers
that issue credit cards, announced that its members had voluntarily agreed not
to withhold any customer data from credit bureaus.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our members recognize that competitive pressures, regardless of their
intensity, do not justify withholding borrower data if the end result is
detrimental to their customers," said Randy Lively, president and chief
executive officer of the group, whose 400 members are mostly regulated by the
Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the move, David Gibbons, deputy comptroller for credit risk,
said, "That's the type of response we were hoping to achieve."

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton says she plans to spend rest of life with husband  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton vowed Tuesday to "spend the
rest of my life" with her husband, the president whose affair with a White House
intern led to his impeachment and an unsuccessful vote last year in the Senate
to remove him from office.
<P>
	   "I have been with my husband for more than half my life. We've been together
- this will be our 25th year of marriage - and we have so much between us and so
many shared experiences and a lot of love in our family, and I certainly intend
to spend the rest of my life with him," Mrs. Clinton told Buffalo's WKBW-TV in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady, who is preparing to run for the Senate from New York, made
her comment after being told that people were saying that "when Bill leaves the
White House, she's going to leave him."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton appeared momentarily taken aback by the comment, but then
quickly offered her thoughts on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   The interview came just minutes after Mrs. Clinton, who is expected to face
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the Senate race, picked up the
endorsement of the Erie County Democratic Committee during a meeting at a
community center in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   In remarks to several hundred Democrats who turned out to offer their
support, Mrs. Clinton predicted victory in the Senate race, if she and Democrats
could get their message out.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am absolutely confident that if we do the best we can to get the word out
about what it is at stake in this election, then ... I will be in Washington and
we will all be working together to make western New York and Erie County and
Buffalo the very best that we can be," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady also told the Democrats that "this will be a very exciting
campaign. It's going to certainly draw a lot of attention and they'll be a lot
of people interested in this race who are from all over the country and even the
world."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton has said she plans to formally enter the Senate race early next
month, and plans to have President Clinton and daughter Chelsea at her side for
the announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the public disclosure of the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky,
Mrs. Clinton has faced questions about the state of her marriage. Usually she
has brushed them aside, although she has said in the past that they are a couple
who still love each other.
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing New York's female voters breaking evenly between Mrs.
Clinton and Giuliani, the first lady sat down Tuesday night to do a one-hour
cyberspace town hall meeting on iVillage.com, an Internet website geared toward
women.

<HEADLINE> SLA Fugitive Trial Delayed Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The bombing conspiracy trial of former Symbionese
Liberation Army fugitive Sara Jane Olson was pushed back at least another month
and a half Tuesday as a judge allowed a defense attorney to leave the case for
family reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial had been scheduled to start Feb. 7, but Superior Court Judge James
Ideman said he had no choice but to grant attorney Stuart Hanlon's request to
leave the case because of family obligations. The defendant said she also agreed
reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
	   Hanlon, a widowed father of two children, lives in San Francisco and said a
new estimate that the trial will last six months makes it impossible for him to
participate.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Olson is accused of placing bombs under two Los Angeles police cars in a
1975 plot to avenge the deaths of members of the radical SLA in a shootout. The
bombs did not explode.
</P>
<P>
	   She was indicted in 1976 and spent the next 23 years as a fugitive, living
as a doctor's wife, community activist and actress in local productions in St.
Paul, Minn. She could face life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge scheduled a status hearing for Feb. 8 and said he would set a new
trial date after that. Ideman said he would aim for perhaps 45 days beyond Feb.
8.

<HEADLINE> Whitman signs law to allow police retirements after 20 years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman signed a law Tuesday allowing
police officers and paid firefighters to retire with pensions after 20 years and
to give pensions to survivors whose spouses die while off-duty.
<P>
	   The law permits many emergency services personnel to retire if they chose to
while in their 40s with a pension set at half their highest annual salary.
</P>
<P>
	   It also provides a lifetime pension to widows and other survivors of police
officers and firefighters who die in off-duty accidents or of illness before
they retire. It replaces what had been a standard, lump sum life-insurance
payment equal to 3 1/2 years' salary.
</P>
<P>
	   "This bill puts the surviving spouses and children of local police officers
on the same footing as the surviving spouses and children of our State Police,"
Whitman said. "As a matter of equity, we owe them these benefits."
</P>
<P>
	   Municipal and city police officers and firefighters had to wait 25 years
before retiring at 65 percent salary, an option they may still choose to qualify
for the higher pension. If they wait until 30 years to retire, the pension is
set at 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The costs associated with this enhanced benefits package continued to be a
source of controversy up to the last minute as the Legislature voted on the bill
last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The approval of expanded benefits came despite opposition from municipal
officials who fear the impact of a rash of early retirements on their public
safety programs and local budgets.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are extremely disappointed that the bill was signed intact" without
amendments, said William Dressel, director of the state League of
Municipalities.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the bill was unanimously opposed in December by the state's Pension
and Health Benefits Review Commission, an advisory panel that counts among its
members state Treasurer Roland Machold and state Personnel Commissioner Janice
Mintz. The commission worried about millions the pension system will need to
cover the new benefits for future retirees.
</P>
<P>
	   The law will require the pension fund to have $338 million more than is now
available in it. Machold's office concluded that plugging this hole would
require annual payments starting at $52 million. The original law hit municipal
governments with most of this cost but amendments approved in December shifted
the entire cost to the state budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill sponsors and the Office of Legislative Services said steady growth in
the pension funds' Wall Street holdings may add enough value to offset any need
for higher payments.
</P>
<P>
	   State troopers currently enjoy the 20-year retirement option and their
survivors qualify for life pensions currently. However, troopers also face
mandatory retirement at age 55, a policy which some local police departments
also follow but which is not mandated in state law.
</P>
<P>
	   Dressel said he was relieved the state agreed to cover the full pension-fund
costs, but he was still concerned about the impact early retirements would have
on cities and towns.

<HEADLINE> Calif. To Vote on Same-Sex Unions  </HEADLINE>
   By BOB EGELKO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Christie Hardwick Vianson has been married twice, to
men, and has no plans to wed her female partner of the past six years.
</P>
<P>
	   But she doesn't want the state, in the form of Proposition 22, telling them
and other same-sex couples they can never marry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the government coming into my personal relationship and making a
decision about whether it's valid,'' says Ms. Vianson, a 40-year-old mother of
three who works for a high-tech company. ``I think it gives legitimacy to people
who want to hate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Proposition 22 is on the California ballot March 7. It is only 14 words
long: ``Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in
California.''
</P>
<P>
	   As far as Rebecca Bennion is concerned, that's a good start. The housewife
and mother of five disavows any anti-gay prejudice but longs for a return to an
earlier era.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would be great if we could roll the years back -- a man and a woman
committed to each other, the wife staying home, nurturing the kids, like my mom
stayed home,'' she says. ``We've tried everything else.''
</P>
<P>
	   The California proposition is not unique: Similar ballot measures passed in
Alaska and Hawaii in 1998, and signatures are being gathered in Colorado and
Nevada.
</P>
<P>
	   But the potential political impact is magnified by California's role as the
nation's most populous state and the presence of a large, visible gay population
in the San Francisco Bay area and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An eighth of the country is being asked to vote on an anti-gay
initiative,'' says Mike Marshall, the No-on-22 campaign manager. ``If it passes,
it sends a profound message to policy-makers and young gays and lesbians who are
struggling with their sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hollywood weighed in early with an anti-22 television commercial last month
by the cast of NBC's ``Will and Grace,'' which has a gay lead character. It said
the proposition ``increases the rhetoric of hate and intolerance'' and would
``inject the government into the most personal decisions.''
</P>
<P>
	   No state has legalized gay marriage. Ever since Hawaii's Supreme Court
raised the possibility of same-sex unions in 1993, Congress and 30 states,
mostly in the South and Midwest, have passed pre-emptive laws saying they won't
recognize such marriages if they are legalized in any other state.
</P>
<P>
	   It is uncertain whether any of those laws can get around the requirement in
the U.S. Constitution that states give ``full faith and credit'' to other
states' laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Hawaii has since adopted a constitutional amendment barring gay marriage.
Vermont is the only state considering legalization, but lawmakers are generally
expected to endorse domestic partner benefits instead.
</P>
<P>
	   Proposition 22 is known as the Knight Initiative, after its sponsor,
Republican state Sen. Pete Knight, whose gay son David has branded the measure a
``blind, uncaring, uninformed, knee-jerk reaction to a subject about which he
knows nothing and wants to know nothing, but which serves his political
career.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pete Knight has declined to be interviewed about the measure. In a statement
last October, Knight said he regretted that his son had made a private matter
public.
</P>
<P>
	   Backers of the measure appear to have learned the lessons of past campaigns
-- a proposed ban on gay teachers in 1978, and Lyndon LaRouche-sponsored
measures in 1986 and 1988 to quarantine AIDS patients. All were defeated after
their sponsors were portrayed as bigoted extremists.
</P>
<P>
	   An independent Field Poll last month showed Proposition 22 leading 51
percent to 40 percent. Opposition in San Francisco and Los Angeles has been
offset by support in rural and suburban areas, says Field Poll director Mark
DiCamillo, who predicted a close election.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's pulling a significant amount of moderate Democrats,'' the key to
winning most California elections, says Bruce Cain, director of the Institute
for Governmental Studies at the University of California at Berkeley. It could
still lose ``if it can be painted as extremist, if there's enough money and if
the campaign is run well enough.''
</P>
<P>
	   So far, supporters have reported raising $5 million, about twice as much as
opponents. More than $310,000 has come from the Roman Catholic Church, while the
Mormon Church has written to 740,000 members urging support for 22.

<HEADLINE> Door-to-door cocaine service yields bad reviews, arrests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A delivery service that made cocaine "as easy to order
as pizza" led to the indictment of 10 men accused of catering their drug trade
to upper-class professionals in prime Manhattan neighborhoods.
<P>
	   The men were accused of operating the delivery service for the last year,
violating federal laws against conspiracy and narcotics distribution, according
to an indictment in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   The "Home Delivery Cocaine Organization," as prosecutors called it,
allegedly used beepers and cell phones for communications with well-to-do
clients whose names, telephone numbers and addresses were kept on file.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said the case "illustrates that law enforcement
will vigorously attack cocaine distribution in every strata of our society."
</P>
<P>
	   "Cocaine distribution and use is destructive of society, especially when it
becomes as easy to order as pizza," White said in a release.
</P>
<P>
	   The men indicted were accused of serving people in a myriad of professions,
including advertising, real estate, investments and even legal fields.
</P>
<P>
	   The organization's records showed hundreds of names, addresses and telephone
numbers of customers in numerous residential buildings on the Upper East Side,
the Upper West Side as well as the neighborhoods of Chelsea and Soho,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   The organization also allegedly delivered to restaurants and bars throughout
Manhattan, sometimes meeting clients on the street outside.
</P>
<P>
	   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for White, said he could not comment on whether
prosecutors were pursuing the customers of the organization.
</P>
<P>
	   But he did add, "The investigation is continuing."
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the deliveries were in small amounts: half a gram for $25, 1 gram
for $50 or 3 grams for $150, court papers showed.
</P>
<P>
	   The orders were placed by customers who beeped the organization, which then
returned the page using cellular telephones often subscribed to in fraudulent
names, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the telephones were being monitored by agents of the Drug Enforcement
Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   After an order was placed, a delivery person posing as a livery cab driver
would meet the customer at a prearranged location, sometimes the residence of
the customer, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a wake-up call to those who believe that they can avoid arrest
through the use of livery cabs and cloned cellular phones," said Lewis Rice Jr.,
special agent in charge of the DEA's New York Division. "Using or selling drugs
is tantamount to playing Russian roulette with the gun loaded."
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the defendants in the case were being held without bail. Another was
held pending a bail hearing later in the week and a fourth was held on $500,000
bail, which his lawyer said he could not afford.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Marc L. Mukasey said the organization's records
showed it made as much as $11,000 in a day.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted, each defendant faces a mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison
and a maximum of life in prison with no parole.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore Improving With Democrats  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore is leading Bill Bradley by a healthy margin in
Iowa just before the caucuses, aided by strong support among Democratic core
groups and a preference by Democrats for his approach to health care, says a
poll released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Los Angeles Times Poll, Vice President Gore had the support of 58
percent of likely Democratic voters in the state while Bradley, a former senator
from New Jersey, had the support of 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has held a 20-point lead in several Iowa polls in recent weeks even as
Bradley has made a concentrated effort to win support for the Jan. 24 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Republican race, the poll had Texas Gov. George W. Bush at 43
percent, publisher Steve Forbes at 25 percent and the other candidates far back.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the Democrats, Gore's Iowa support is strong among traditional party
groups -- with two-thirds of women, union members and those making less than
$40,000 a year supporting him. Bradley's best showing comes among men and people
who are college-educated, the poll showed.
</P>
<P>
	   By a 2-1 margin, the Democratic voters polled say they prefer Gore's smaller
scale changes in the health-care plan to Bradley's broader proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My suspicion would be that people may like Gore's plan better because they
know it,'' said Hugh Winebrenner, a professor of public administration at Drake
University in Des Moines. ``His is incremental change and Bradley's is a greater
change.''
</P>
<P>
	   Two-thirds of likely Democratic voters said there was some difference, but
not much, between the party's two candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Likely Democratic voters said the top issues in the presidential race are
education and health care. The top personal quality for Gore supporters was his
experience. For Bradley it was his integrity.
</P>
<P>
	   The Times Poll surveyed 571 likely Democratic and 557 likely Republican
caucus-goers from Wednesday through Sunday. It had an error margin of plus or
minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, Forbes was as close as he's been in Iowa polls this
month -- within 18 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Top reasons that Republican voters cited for supporting Bush were honesty
and integrity, strong leadership and the likelihood that he can win in November.
Forbes supporters cited taxes and his willingness to stand up for what he
believes.
</P>
<P>
	   Poll director Susan Pinkus said, ``The reasons that Bush's voters were
attracted to him were more of his personal traits rather than issues. With
Forbes, it was the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
	   She noted that six out of 10 likely Republican voters approved of a
candidate injecting his religion into the campaign, while four out of five
Democrats thought it should not play a role.
</P>
<P>
	   One veteran Iowa poll-watcher offered a caution about efforts to predict the
caucus outcome.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The thing to remember about polls in Iowa historically is that they are
often wrong, particularly on the Republican side,'' said Winebrenner, noting the
polls often undersample Christian conservatives. ``The number for Bush is
getting perilously low. I think you will find that (Gary) Bauer is stronger than
the polls indicate, he has a good organization. Forbes might be slightly
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative activist Bauer had 7 percent in the poll, close to the same
level as Arizona Sen. John McCain, who isn't campaigning in Iowa but had 8
percent, and commentator Alan Keyes, who had 10 percent. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch
had the support of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Political scientist Arthur Miller of the University of Iowa said much of the
drama in the Iowa caucuses may well come from how well candidates do after the
first-place finishers. ``They're out creating the expectations so they can
exceed them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, which has the nation's first presidential primary, both
the Republican and Democratic races are very close, according to an
ABC-Washington Post poll released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Among people planning to vote in the GOP primary, McCain had 40 percent to
36 percent for Bush, who said Tuesday: It's a good race and I'm glad. It's made
me a better candidate, frankly.''

percentage points for self-described definite voters.

<HEADLINE> ZZ Top Manager Wife Killer Executed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A man who broke a woman's neck and stole her
Cadillac in 1991 was executed by injection Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Spencer Corey Goodman, 31, was convicted of killing Cecile Ham, 48, whose
husband managed the rock band ZZ Top.
</P>
<P>
	   Goodman, then a twice-convicted felon just out on parole, was overdue at a
halfway house when he stole Mrs. Ham's car from a Houston pharmacy. As she got
into the driver's seat, Goodman knocked her unconscious and pushed her limp body
to the floor.
</P>
<P>
	   After driving a few miles, Goodman ``used martial arts and broke the lady's
neck,'' he told investigators.
</P>
<P>
	   Goodman put Mrs. Ham's body in the trunk and drove around in her car, giving
away presents she had bought and using her credit cards, prosecutors said. He
eventually dumped her body in a field and was arrested in Colorado a month after
the killing.
</P>
<P>
	   The execution of Goodman was the second of seven scheduled in Texas this
month.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Targets Negative Campaigning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The Republican presidential campaigns are getting
frantic about negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   In a memo to staff and supporters, Kenneth Blackwell, national chairman of
Steve Forbes' campaign, is warning that rival George W. Bush's team plans to
``smile in public while going extremely negative below the radar. Get your
friends and colleagues prepared. Be prepared for an onslaught of ugly, negative
calls from the Bush campaign to Forbes supporters.''
</P>
<P>
	   The memo is a reaction to mailings the Bush campaign is preparing to send
Republicans in advance of Monday's caucuses. One of the mailings, a letter by
Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, a Bush supporter, reminds Iowans that some
Republican candidates were attacked in the 1996 campaign ``through misleading
mail, negative attack ads and trash phone calls.'' It is a not-too-veiled
reference to Forbes, whose criticism of eventual nominee Bob Dole undermined the
former senator's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Someone is now using these tactics against another good Republican, George
W. Bush. These tactics are wrong and hurt our party,'' read a letter on Bush's
behalf that is being mailed to Iowa Republicans. Bush also has prepared other
mailings that raise questions about Forbes' commitment to ethanol subsidies --
an important issue in Iowa -- and defend Bush's record on taxes in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blackwell memo and Grassley's mailing are textbook examples of
grassroots campaigns trying to rally their troops in the closing days of a
presidential election, hoping to boost turnout for Monday's caucuses.

<HEADLINE> Consumers Paying Debt More Quickly  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Personal bankruptcy rates are coming down from historic
highs as many consumers have sped up repayment of their credit card debts, a
consumer group said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Consumer Federation of America said 112,000 fewer people filed for and
received bankruptcy court protection last year than in 1998. That's an 8 percent
drop to under 1.3 million that the federation termed the largest one-year
decline on record.
</P>
<P>
	   More cautious borrowing by consumers is at the heart of the decrease, the
federation said, saying that has forced credit card companies to restrain their
solicitations and lures. For the first time in a decade, the group said, credit
card lenders have curbed the expansion of credit lines, or limits, offered to
their customers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Consumers have increasingly just said 'no' to credit card solicitations,"
Stephen Brobeck, executive director of Consumer Federation, said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   While 2.8 percent of consumers accepted unsolicited offers of new credit
cards in 1992, that dropped to 1 percent in January-September 1999, Brobeck
said.
</P>
<P>
	   And lenders have reduced the number of solicitations. They mailed an
estimated 2.4 billion credit card solicitations in the first nine months of last
year, which projects to 3.1 billion for the whole year, compared with 3.5
billion in all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Brobeck said, many consumers with credit card debts have
realized the importance of paying more than the minimum required on their
monthly bills. They are sending heftier payments as well as defaulting less
frequently on their debts, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The data were released a week before the Senate is scheduled to resume
debate on major bipartisan legislation, pushed by credit card companies and
retail businesses, that would make it tougher for people to erase their debts in
bankruptcy court. The House approved parallel legislation last May by a
veto-proof margin, 313-108.
</P>
<P>
	   Proponents of the legislation have said it was needed to stanch a rising
tide of personal bankruptcies that had occurred despite the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Brobeck and other Consumer Federation officials said that given the decline
in personal bankruptcies, the legislation was overly harsh and not needed.
</P>
<P>
	   But the banking industry and lawmakers who support the legislation say that
even with the decline, personal bankruptcies remain at historic high levels and
legislation is needed to prevent abuse of the bankruptcy process by some
consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of Americans filing personal bankruptcies in 1998, at nearly 1.4
million, was up more than 300 percent from 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, a key author of the bankruptcy legislation,
called the recent decline in filings a slight change and insisted that a
"bankruptcy crisis" still exists.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the decrease in filings from 1998 to 1999 should be viewed in the
context of an unusually high level of bankruptcies in 1998, "in part because of
aggressive marketing by bankruptcy lawyers who pressed unwitting consumers to
file" before passage of the new legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's good news that consumers are showing restraint," said Patricia
Boerger, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association. She added, however,
that the recent decline does not ensure a long-term trend.
</P>
<P>
	   "The reality is that the current bankruptcy (law) is broken," Ms. Boerger
said. "It allows people who can afford to pay their debts to walk away."
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, she said, credit card lenders are forced to raise rates for
responsible consumers, costing households an average $400 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The group's data are based in part on a new study by economist Lawrence
Ausubel, an economics professor at the University of Maryland, whose figures
indicate personal bankruptcies declined to 1,285,800 last year from 1,397,700 in
1998, down 8 percent. The drop continued last year, he found.
</P>
<P>
	   Figures released last year by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts,
which oversees bankruptcy judges, among others, also showed a decline. For
example, they showed personal bankruptcies declining 2 percent during the 12
months ended June 30, 1999, the first yearly decrease since 1995.

<HEADLINE> Council Stalls on Iraq Inspector  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council failed to reach an agreement
Tuesday on naming a new U.N. chief weapons inspector for Iraq, with Russia,
China and France objecting to the secretary-general's candidate, Rolf Ekeus, and
requesting further meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   The council president, U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, said ambassadors
and foreign ministers would continue to discuss the matter among themselves
until agreement is found. He said it could be several days, if not weeks, before
an agreement is reached. No deadline was set and no new date scheduled for
talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Monday that Ekeus was best suited for the
job. In response, ambassadors from Russia, France and China sent Holbrooke
letters saying they couldn't accept the appointment and requested new
candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Ekeus headed the United Nations' first inspection agency for Iraq, the U.N.
Special Commission, which was created in 1991 in the aftermath of the Gulf War
to rid Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian and French ambassadors said Tuesday it was Ekeus' association
with the old commission, tainted by allegations of spying on behalf of the
United States, that made him unfit to head the new agency. The U.N. Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission was created in December to replace the
Special Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. Special Commission inspectors pulled out of Iraq in December 1998,
ahead of U.S. and British airstrikes, and Baghdad has said they may not return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ambassador Ekeus' candidature -- though we respect him highly as a
diplomat and very able personality -- does not correspond to the criteria of
having a new mechanism and ensuring the cooperation on the part of Iraq,'' said
Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke said Ekeus remained a candidate for the post but that other names
might be put forward. He said all ambassadors agreed that Annan had done his
part in choosing a candidate and that the matter now rested squarely with the
council to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Annan had exhausted his search for a
candidate, and that the U.N. chief was still hopeful Ekeus might still be
considered.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His hope was that they would see it in the context of the large number of
candidates who had already been considered and been rejected and that he (Ekeus)
might be seen by council members as a reasonable compromise candidate,'' Eckhard
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq was quick to pounce on the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Tuesday the nomination was an
indication of Annan's ``evil intent,'' and showed he was not serious about
finding a solution.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cairo, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa appeared to back the
sentiment, saying ``there are question marks over the return to the old names.''
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador, however, said the United States supported
Ekeus enthusiastically, adding that Annan had been ``exhaustive, diligent,
fair-minded and impartial,'' throughout the process of finding a candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Iraq is not a member of the Security Council,'' Holbrooke added. ``Iraq
does not have a veto power over the selection.''

<HEADLINE> Tourists Flee Indonesia Violence  </HEADLINE>
   By GEOFF SPENCER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MATARAM, Indonesia (AP) -- As an Islamic prayer call echoed from a nearby
mosque on the balmy tourist island of Lombok, a Muslim mob ransacked a house
abandoned by its terrified Christian owners.
</P>
<P>
	   ``God is great!'' a teen-age boy screamed as his friends pushed a car out of
the garage and turned it over in the street. The crowd scattered when riot
police arrived.
</P>
<P>
	   Muslim mobs targeted Lombok's Christian minority for a second day Tuesday,
burning and ransacking homes in the main town of Mataram and forcing hundreds of
tourists to flee. Security forces fired warning shots to stop one gang from
storming a police station, where 500 Christians -- many of them ethnic Chinese
-- had taken shelter.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's violence came a day after mobs burned and desecrated a dozen
churches in Lombok, 670 miles east of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
	   Lombok, a picturesque volcanic island of palm-fringed beaches and green rice
fields, is home to Indonesia's three main faiths. Most of its people are Muslim,
along with minority groups of Hindus and Christians.
</P>
<P>
	   Several foreign embassies, including those representing Australia, New
Zealand and Switzerland, have warned their citizens not to visit Lombok.
</P>
<P>
	   Some fear that religious intolerance, which has gripped another part of
eastern Indonesia for more than a year, has taken root in Lombok and could sweep
across the sprawling Southeast Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, gangs torched two restaurants at Senggigi, on the island's west
coast. Most nearby hotels had earlier evacuated their guests by ferry to the
neighboring island of Bali, Indonesia's main vacation destination. There were no
reports of injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   In Mataram, small groups of people sifted through the ashes of burned
churches. One of the largest, the Immune Protestant Church, was ransacked and
charred, obscene graffiti daubed on its walls.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Be afraid pastor, the Muslims will drink your blood,'' was scrawled across
the entrance. The words ``public toilet'' were written where an altar once
stood.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Thousands of people attacked the church. They burned and smashed
everything,'' said a man who identified himself by the single name of Fajaki.
Neighbors said the church's clergy had left the island in fear.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of Hindus barricaded their neighborhoods Tuesday and carried spears
and swords to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence erupted Monday when local Muslims protested the government's
failure to quell violence between Muslims and Christians in war-torn Maluku
province, further to the east.
</P>
<P>
	   The sectarian strife there has been fueled by age-old rivalries and more
recent complaints by Christians that Muslim newcomers from other parts of
Indonesia have taken jobs and are not respecting local customs.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past year, about 2,000 people have died in religious fighting in
Maluku and North Maluku provinces, formerly known as the Spice Islands, or
Moluccas.
</P>
<P>
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 210 million people are Muslims, making it
the world's most populous Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
	   President Abdurrahman Wahid, a prominent but moderate Islamic leader elected
three months ago, has condemned growing calls for a holy war or ``jihad''
against the Christian minority. But Wahid's reformist government could be
threatened if sectarian violence grows.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president needs to give a very stern warning to Muslim groups to stop
this violence -- otherwise it could get out of control,'' said Ong Hok Ham, a
historian at the University of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
	   The unrest has added to uncertainty surrounding Wahid's administration.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, rumors of a possible military coup swept through the capital,
Jakarta, after Wahid blocked plans by senior generals to impose martial law in
several trouble spots, including Maluku and the western province of Aceh, where
hundreds have been killed in separatist fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   The top brass are also worried that they might be prosecuted for atrocities
committed by Indonesian soldiers in East Timor, which broke free of Indonesia
last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Speculation is rife that Wahid might soon fire his powerful security
minister, Gen. Wiranto, a former armed forces commander under ex-presidents
Suharto and B.J. Habibie.

<HEADLINE> Whitman vetoes bills designed to crack down on underage smoking  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman on Tuesday snuffed out a bill
that would have slapped fines on teens who smoke in public, suggesting it could
have done more harm than good.
<P>
	   The governor also vetoed a bill that would have gone after underage drinkers
in private homes, saying it would have taken the long arm of state government
"too far into private family conduct."
</P>
<P>
	   Both bills were pushed by lawmakers who said more needs to be done to curb
teen smoking and drinking. In both cases, Whitman essentially said: Good idea,
but not the best plan of attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Because both bills passed in the waning days of the 208th Legislature,
Whitman's vetoes stand. Lawmakers can introduce the bills again during the
current two-year session.
</P>
<P>
	   The smoking bill, A-2254, would have forbidden underage smokers from
possessing cigarettes in public places such as streets, schools, parks and
shopping centers. Underage smokers caught puffing in public or possessing
tobacco products could have been hit with a $25 fine for first-time offenders.
The fine would have been suspended, however, until a minor attended a class that
teaches why smoking is bad. Repeat offenders would have been ordered to perform
up to 15 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
	   Sponsors said the bill was intended to send a strong message about smoking
to teens. However, anti-smoking groups opposed the bill, saying no studies show
such a crackdown actually cuts down on youth smoking.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman said in her veto message that anti-smoking groups told her "this is
not the most effective or efficient use of public resources to combat smoking by
young people."
</P>
<P>
	   The governor also said she worried that the bill "may inadvertently harm
community policing efforts aimed at building positive relationships between
police and juveniles, and will draw youths into the municipal court system."
</P>
<P>
	   Assemblyman Joseph Suliga, D-Union, a sponsor of the bipartisan bill, said
he believed it was killed "by misinformation."
</P>
<P>
	   "Every year New Jersey continues to delay measures that keep young people
away from tobacco, another 36,000 kids will begin smoking," Suliga said.
"Obviously, the steps that have been undertaken in reducing tobacco's appeal to
youngsters have not had much impact. The primary purpose of my bill was to break
outside the bounds of traditional youth tobacco control programs and educate
kids on the immediate consequences of smoking."
</P>
<P>
	   Suliga said some police chiefs told him the bill would not harm community
police efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Larry Downs, director of NJ Breathes, an anti-smoking group, said the bill's
"unintended effect" would have been to send the message that tobacco use is
acceptable for those who turn 18.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no research that says this approach was going to work," said
Downs. "We'd rather see the money go to good tobacco control policies."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman also vetoed S-1617, which lawmakers said would crack down on
underage drinkers who imbibe in private homes. Underage drinking is already
prohibited in public places, and sponsors said this bill would solve a problem
they say is particularly acute during summers at the Jersey shore.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor, however, said the bill could go too far.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am concerned that the prohibitions could be construed to apply to
situations in which an underage person consumes even a small amount of alcohol
under the watchful eye of an adult family member, such as a grandparent,"
Whitman said. "Application of this bill in such situations may intrude too far
into private family conduct."

<HEADLINE> Long-Term Care Tax Credit Offered  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, resurrecting an initiative that died
in Congress last year, will propose up to $3,000 in tax credits to help 2
million Americans struggling to provide long-term care for elderly or disabled
relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   The tax credit would be triple the size of last year's failed proposal and
would cost $28 billion over 10 years. It will be announced on Wednesday as part
of Clinton's buildup to his Jan. 27 State of the Union address. An
election-minded Congress will decide whether to enact it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we've got to deal with the aging of America,'' Clinton said
Tuesday night in Boston. ``We've got to decide what were going to do with Social
Security and Medicare, how we're going to prepare for this explosion in the
number of people over 65.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president also will propose spending $1.25 billion over 10 years for
local agencies that support family caregivers with counseling, training and care
techniques. The money would be awarded to state and local ``agencies on aging,''
created by the 1965 Older Americans Act.
</P>
<P>
	   White House officials believe they have a better chance of passing the plan
this year because health care has become a hot issue in the presidential
campaign as the baby boom generation moves toward retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats and Republicans alike are talking about proposals for prescription
drug coverage under Medicare, health coverage initiatives, a patients' bill of
rights, drugs over the Internet, long-term care and other programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a growing recognition of the demographics facing this country,
particularly on long-term care,'' said White House health policy adviser Chris
Jennings. ``There's a growing momentum and a recognition that there's a lot of
unmet health care needs, and this is one of them. The president believes there's
a very good chance we can get this thing done.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Clinton proposed a $1,000 tax credit for long-term care needs.
The measure drew bipartisan support but did not make its way through Congress as
the president fought with Republicans over tax cuts and ultimately vetoed their
$792 billion tax-cut plan. This year, Republicans say they will offer a far more
modest package of targeted tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, in his final budget proposal before leaving office, tripled the
size of the proposed long-term care tax credit this year at the urging of senior
groups and health policy advocates, Jennings said.
</P>
<P>
	   If enacted, the credit would be phased in beginning with $1,000 in 2001,
rising in $500 increments so that eligible people would receive $3,000 in 2005.
The credit would be phased out beginning at $110,000 in income for families and
$75,000 for unmarried taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House said the credit would help about 2 million Americans,
including 1.2 million older Americans, more than 500,000 non-elderly adults and
approximately 250,000 children.
</P>
<P>
	   While difficult to quantify, the economic value of caregiving for families
ranges from $4,800 to $10,400 per caregiver, according to one study cited by the
White House. Thus, the proposed $3,000 tax credit could cover up to 60 percent
of families' costs.

<HEADLINE> Lagos: Court Decides Pinochet Fate  </HEADLINE>
   By EDUARDO GALLARDO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Chile's president-elect said Tuesday he does not
have the legal authority to put Gen. Augusto Pinochet on trial, but would not
interfere if the courts chose to prosecute the former dictator.
</P>
<P>
	   President-elect Ricardo Lagos, who emerged in the mid-1980s as a leading
opponent of Pinochet and was briefly imprisoned for his activities, spoke in
apparent anticipation of Pinochet's imminent release.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In Chile it is for judges, not the president, to decide if someone is to
be tried,'' Lagos said. ``What a president can do is to ensure that a judge's
resolution is respected, and that I will do.''
</P>
<P>
	   In another indication that Pinochet may soon be free, Britain on Tuesday
gave Chile permission to send a government plane to an air base north of London
to take the former dictator home.
</P>
<P>
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw said last week he was inclined to send Pinochet
home because he is too ill to stand trial, and gave human rights groups until
Tuesday to file appeals. While visiting Britain 15 months ago, Pinochet was
arrested on a Spanish warrant seeking his extradition on charges of human rights
abuses during his 17-year rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet, under police guard at a mansion west of London, wears a pacemaker,
has diabetes, difficulty in walking and last fall suffered a third minor stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   Leftist politicians, human rights groups and families of victims of the
Pinochet regime have demanded that Pinochet stand trial. There are 56 lawsuits
filed against Pinochet pending in local Chilean courts. The judge handling them,
Juan Guzman, said he plans to ask for a mental health evaluation of Pinochet
once he is back in Chile.

<HEADLINE> Major announcement expected in 1975 murder of Greenwich teen-ager  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - More than 24 years after Greenwich teen-ager
Martha Moxley was found beaten to death with a golf club, an arrest warrant has
been signed for a suspect in the killing.
<P>
	   Prosecutors refused to comment on the suspect Tuesday. But Michael Skakel, a
nephew of the late U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was the focus of an 18-month
grand jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel's lawyer, Michael Sherman, said Skakel continues to maintain his
innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   "Regardless of the grand jury's recommendations or actions, he has been and
will continue to be innocent of any wrongdoing here," Sherman said late Tuesday.
"He's obviously very anxious about having this matter resolved, and he's looking
forward to being exonerated, whether it be tomorrow or sometime after that."
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors scheduled a news conference for 9 a.m. Wednesday to announce the
results of the grand jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Connecticut Post planned to report in Wednesday's editions that a judge
has signed a warrant for a suspect. The newspaper, quoting unnamed sources in
Bridgeport Superior Court, did not identify what suspect is named in the arrest
warrant, but said the warrant was based on a finding of probable cause by the
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman said he has prepared Skakel for his possible arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they elect to do that, he will appear (in court), he will plead not
guilty, he will go to trial and he will be acquitted," Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict is expected to
release a report from Superior Court Judge George Thim, who has investigated the
case for the last 18 months as a one-man grand jury. Thim's report was filed
Tuesday under seal.
</P>
<P>
	   Thim's investigation focused on Skakel, who at the time of the killing was a
15-year-old neighbor of Moxley's. Skakel is the son of Rushton Skakel Sr., who
is the brother of Ethel Kennedy, the widow of U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
	   On the night of her death, Oct. 30, 1975, Ms. Moxley had visited the Skakel
home, along with several other teen-agers after a night of pre-Halloween pranks.
Her body was found the next day under some low-hanging fir trees on her family's
estate, located across the street from the Skakel estate.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after the killing, the 6-iron used to kill her was matched to a set
owned by the Skakel family. But no one was ever arrested in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Michael Skakel, and his older brother Thomas Skakel, then 17, were
looked at possible suspects, along with others, including Kenneth Littleton, a
tutor who had just moved into the Skakel house the day of the killing.
</P>
<P>
	   After more than two decades of dead ends, Thim was appointed as a grand
juror in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Once Thim began calling witnesses, it quickly became clear that Michael
Skakel was the focus of the probe, even though the proceedings are held in
secret.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors filed court documents in which they claimed Skakel had made
"admissions as to the murder of Martha Moxley" when he lived at a school and
substance abuse treatment center from 1978 to 1980. Prosecutors said he made the
admissions to fellow students at the Elan school in Poland Spring, Maine. Thim
heard testimony from former students at the school behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
	   Littleton was eliminated as a suspect after he was granted immunity from
prosecution in August 1998, after he testified before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Thim's 18-month investigation ended on Dec. 10. He had 60 days from that
date to file his written report.
</P>
<P>
	   Martha's mother, Dorthy Moxley, said prosecutors had informed her of the
news conference, but would not tell her whether an arrest warrant was being
sought for Skakel.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am hopeful," she said. "I have prayed for this for so long."

<HEADLINE> Kaczynski Says Guilty Plea Coerced  </HEADLINE>
   By BOB EGELKO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Convicted Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski says he was
coerced into pleading guilty to three murders and wants a federal appeals court
to allow a trial, which could end in a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   The guilty pleas ``were induced by the threat of a mental-state defense that
Kaczynski would have found unendurable, as well as by deprivation of
constitutional rights,'' such as the right to control his own defense and
represent himself, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   In a 58-page, handwritten brief, composed in a maximum-security federal
prison in Colorado, Kaczynski asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to be
allowed to withdraw his guilty pleas and go to trial.
</P>
<P>
	   As an alternative, he requested a new U.S. District Court hearing, before a
different judge, on whether his rights were violated when his lawyers insisted
on using a defense based on his mental condition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Kaczynski's counsel's portrayal of him as a grotesque lunatic would have
been broadcast nationwide, and this was a prospect that anyone might have found
unendurable. Suicide to avoid public humiliation is by no means unknown,'' wrote
Kaczynski, who attempted suicide in jail after his lawyers told him of their
plans.
</P>
<P>
	   His brief was due Tuesday but was filed Dec. 28. The document delves into
complex constitutional arguments, abounds with legal citations, and refers to
the defendant as ``Kaczynski'' and to the writer as ``we.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kaczynski, a Harvard-trained mathematician who became a forest recluse
living in Montana, pleaded guilty in January 1998 to mail bombings that killed
three people and injured 23. Two deaths occurred in Sacramento and the third was
in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   His guilty plea came after the U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell of
Sacramento refused to let him represent himself or delay the trial to let
Kaczynski get a lawyer who would present a defense based on his views about
technology and the environment.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaczynski began the appeal shortly after he pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals court allowed Kaczynski to reopen the case in October, ruling
that he had made a substantial showing his rights were violated when he was
denied the right to represent himself or prevent his lawyers from offering
evidence about his mental condition.
</P>
<P>
	   After further arguments, the three-judge appellate panel will decide whether
to let the case go to trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Lapham, the government's lawyer, declined
comment. Before Kaczynski pleaded guilty, prosecutors argued that he should be
allowed to control his defense, even at the risk of his life.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department initially sought a death sentence for Kaczynski but
accepted a life sentence after a court-ordered psychiatric examination,
conducted over his objections, concluded he was a paranoid schizophrenic.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaczynski's writings have connected the attacks to his campaign against
technological tyranny.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Mello, a Vermont Law School professor who has written a book on the
case and helped Kaczynski with an earlier legal filing, said Tuesday he thought
Kaczynski could represent himself adequately.
</P>
<P>
	   If he is convicted and the trial goes to a penalty phase, Mello said,
Kaczynski is ``the best person to explain ... why he did what he did, why he
felt morally compelled ... why he doesn't deserve to die for what he did, or why
he wants to die.''

<HEADLINE> 4 Nabbed for Animal Critic Threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Four people were arrested on charges of threatening to
firebomb an animal clinic if they were not given a cat anesthetic sometimes used
as a party drug, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Drugs had been taken from the AAA Animal Clinic in two burglaries, police
said. On Friday, the clinic veterinarian found a letter demanding that he place
the drug ketamine in a box behind the office or it would be firebombed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have shown in the past that your business is easily penetrable,'' the
letter said. The veterinarian called police, who set up a sting.
</P>
<P>
	   Two people came to the clinic early Sunday and picked up what they believed
to be vials of ketamine. Two others in a getaway car were also arrested, police
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Adam Jacob Sharkan, 20, Janie Lynn Ueberroth, Nicholas Morris Moser, 18, and
Arion Horn, 19, were charged with extortion or conspiracy to commit extortion
and other charges related to the break-ins.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no answer at two of their homes Tuesday, and listed phone numbers
could not be found for the other two.
</P>
<P>
	   Ketamine, known as ``Vitamin K'' or ``Special K,'' is popular because it can
give a euphoric high. It also causes hallucinations, slows the heart rate and
depresses respiratory function.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Cites Co for Faulty HIV Tests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A San Diego company that supplies test kits for the virus
that causes AIDS has been charged with falsely representing that the kits could
accurately detect the virus, the government announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, Alfa Scientific Designs
Inc. consented to halt all sales of its HIV tests. The company does not sell
directly to consumers, the agency said, but sells to distributors. A preliminary
injunction against the company was filed in U.S. District Court in Southern
California on Jan. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   The company supplied the tests to Medimax Inc. and its owner, David M.
Rothbart. Medimax was charged last December with falsely representing on the
Internet that its HIV tests were accurate. Medimax agreed to a preliminary
injunction, as well to no longer market the test kits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This case is especially troubling because the company's deceptive actions
may have delayed HIV positive users of the test from seeking the medical
treatment they need,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the commission's Bureau
of Consumer Protection. ``Companies that sell faulty HIV tests are putting
people's lives in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators said the tests often produced false negative results.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall Moderately  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen early Wednesday ahead of
a weekend meeting of finance officials from major industrial nations. Japanese
stocks fell moderately.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 105.59 yen, up 0.41 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo but
lower than its late New York level of 105.72 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 121.70 points, or 0.63
percent, to 19,074.87 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Tuesday, the
average closed down 240.66 points, or 1.24 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In early currency trading, the dollar edged higher against the yen, helped
by reported buying of euros for yen by European investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders said remarks by French Finance Minister Christian Sautter on Tuesday
that Saturday's Group of Seven meeting in Tokyo will discuss foreign exchange
and the promotion of economic growth helped to support the dollar and euro
versus the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   But trading was quiet as other investors were retreating to the sidelines
ahead of the weekend meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the
G-7, consisting of the United States, Japan, Britain, France, Italy, Canada and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan hopes the G-7 will support its goal of subduing the yen's strength,
which authorities here fear could derail the country's budding economic recovery
by making its exports too expensive overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 107.14 yen, up from 105.98 yen
late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices started lower after the Dow Jones industrial
average fell 162.26, or 1.4 percent, to 11,560.72 at Tuesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "Tokyo sentiment is not particularly strong now. U.S. interest rates are on
an upward trend," said Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted that the Fed
may boost interest rates at its next meeting Feb. 1-2 in a preemptive step to
contain inflationary pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 13.99 points, or 0.84 percent, to 1,651.85. The TOPIX closed
down 16.13 points, or 0.96 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.7500
percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.7450 percent. Its price fell 0.04 point to
100.43.

<HEADLINE> First Lady To Stay With Clinton  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton vowed Tuesday to ``spend the
rest of my life'' with President Clinton, whose relationship with a White House
intern led to his impeachment and a failed Senate vote last year to remove him
from office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have been with my husband for more than half my life. We've been
together -- this will be our 25th year of marriage -- and we have so much
between us and so many shared experiences and a lot of love in our family, and I
certainly intend to spend the rest of my life with him,'' Mrs. Clinton told
Buffalo's WKBW-TV in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady, who is preparing to run for the Senate from New York,
commented after being told people were saying that ``when Bill leaves the White
House, she's going to leave him.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton appeared momentarily taken aback by the comment, but then
quickly offered her thoughts.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky became public, Mrs.
Clinton has faced questions about the state of her marriage. She usually brushes
them aside, although she has said in the past that they are a couple who still
love each other.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton plans to formally enter the Senate race next month, and has
said she hopes to have her husband and daughter Chelsea at her side for the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, she predicted victory in the Senate race if she and Democrats get
their message out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am absolutely confident that if we do the best we can to get the word
out about what it is at stake in this election, then ... I will be in Washington
and we will all be working together to make western New York and Erie County and
Buffalo the very best that we can be,'' she told several hundred Democrats at a
Buffalo community center.

<HEADLINE> Sheppard Coroner Study Sparks Fight  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN AFFLECK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- A coroner's report on evidence in the case that inspired
TV's ``The Fugitive'' bolsters the argument that Dr. Sam Sheppard killed his
wife 46 years ago, prosecutors said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple's son and an attorney working to prove Sheppard was innocent of
the murder said most of the work done by Cuyahoga County Coroner Elizabeth
Balraj is flawed. They said a DNA test on the fetus Marilyn Sheppard was
carrying when she died helps clear her husband.
</P>
<P>
	   Balraj, working at the request of county prosecutors, examined Mrs.
Sheppard's body after it was exhumed last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The coroner also examined photographs from the original crime scene and
tried unsuccessfully to conclude what type of weapon the killer used. Mrs.
Sheppard was murdered in her bed at the family's home on Lake Erie early on July
4, 1954.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctor was convicted of his wife's murder and spent 10 years in prison
before the Supreme Court overturned the verdict and Sheppard was acquitted at a
retrial.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors are defending the state in a wrongful imprisonment lawsuit
brought by Sam Reese Sheppard, 52, the couple's son. The case goes to trial on
Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Balraj said DNA tests on the fetus could not prove with absolute certainty
that Sheppard was the father. One DNA test indicated that Sheppard was the
father, but the results could not be reproduced, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We decided to call these results inconclusive,'' Balraj said. ``But from
our examinations it is most likely the father of the fetus is Sam Sheppard.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors had the fetus tested in the hope that it would show Sheppard was
not the father, potentially giving him a motive for killing his wife.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know it was their child,'' Sam Reese Sheppard said. ``My dad told me we
were expecting a baby. This was a ploy by prosecutors to tarnish my family's
reputation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sheppard always said his wife was killed by a bushy-haired intruder who
knocked him unconscious when he ran to her aid.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sheppard team says DNA and other evidence point to former family window
washer Richard Eberling as the murderer. Eberling died in prison in 1998, where
he was serving a life sentence for another murder.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The physical evidence now being uncovered calls into question Dr.
Sheppard's version of events,'' Prosecutor William Mason said.
</P>
<P>
	   Balraj tried to reconstruct a bloodstain on Mrs. Sheppard's pillow and
concluded that it came from a blood-soaked object, possibly a murder weapon,
placed on some already dried blood as long as 80 minutes after the first stain
dried.
</P>
<P>
	   That would indicate the murder weapon, never found by police, was still in
the house long after the killing. Sheppard said the murderer fled soon after
slaying.
</P>
<P>
	   While Balraj was unable to settle on the weapon used in the killing, she
said a flashlight, something that an intruder would carry and a weapon suggested
by the Sheppard team, would have broken in the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheppard attorney Terry Gilbert said the methods used in Balraj's
investigation were questionable and ``clearly not comparable to the conditions
of the murder. Their attempts to pick away at our case don't amount to much.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Misses Waco Evidence Deadline  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- Government attorneys failed to meet a federal judge's
Tuesday deadline to turn over all evidence sought by relatives suing for
wrongful death in the Branch Davidian inferno.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Attorney Michael Bradford said although the government sent 50 boxes of
materials to plaintiffs' attorneys over the holiday weekend, an additional 2,500
pages of documents must be declassified before being sent.
</P>
<P>
	   He said government attorneys also must reproduce and hand over items from 31
boxes of materials, including photographs and computer disks, which were
surrendered to the Waco federal court last fall at the direction of U.S.
District Judge Walter Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   A private contractor the government hired had overlooked the materials and
is making copies for delivery Wednesday, Bradford said. The Justice Department
had sought a two-week delay, but Smith rejected their request last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Lead plaintiffs' attorney Michael Caddell said last week that he had ``zero
sympathy'' for the government's argument that it cannot meet court-imposed
deadlines because it has limited resources to cull through the requested
information.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are over 9,000 lawyers in the Justice Department,'' he said. ``They
can put as many lawyers on this project as they feel appropriate. If this were
something that were important to the Justice Department, they would man up and
get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
	   Smith set a May 15 trial date.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, Caddell filed a request for Smith to compel the government's
lawyers to answer more completely the question of whether any government
personnel -- military or civilian -- fired shots during the deadly siege's final
hours.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department and FBI long have denied that federal agents fired
shots on April 19, 1993. But the government's sworn answer to the plaintiffs'
question of whether ``any person under the employment, agency, control or
direction of the U.S. or any other government, agency or organization'' fired
shots is incomplete, Caddell wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The deadly standoff began Feb. 28, 1993, when federal agents raided the
rural compound of Branch Davidian leader David Koresh and his followers. The
siege ended in a fire that killed Koresh and about 80 followers, some of whom
were shot.
</P>
<P>
	   The government says the Davidians died by their own hands.

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- The commission investigating the Texas A&AMP;M
bonfire collapse took steps Tuesday to determine whether human error contributed
to the accident that killed 12 people last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The five-member panel hired Performance Improvement International, based in
San Clemente, Calif., to seek out possible mistakes in supervision or
organization that may have led to the Nov. 18 collapse of the 7,000-log stack,
which also injured 27 people.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's president, Chong Chiu, who helped investigate the nation's
worst commercial nuclear accident at Three Mile Island in 1979, told the
commission the root causes of accidents are typically in management or
organization, not in individual mistakes or equipment failures.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you pull a string, eventually ... you will find out that a lot of
events will end up at the top,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission also has hired three other companies: Fay Engineering, which
is reviewing the design of the bonfire over its 90-year history; Packer
Engineering, which is looking into construction of the 1999 bonfire stack; and
Kroll Associates, which is performing investigation coordination and data
management.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A delivery service that made cocaine ``as easy to order as
pizza'' led to the indictment of 10 men accused of catering their drug trade to
upper-class professionals in prime Manhattan neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Cocaine distribution and use is destructive of society, especially when it
becomes as easy to order as pizza,'' U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of names, addresses and telephone numbers of customers in numerous
residential buildings on the Upper East Side, the Upper West Side, Chelsea and
Soho were listed with the service, authorities said. The organization also
allegedly delivered to restaurants and bars.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the deliveries were in small amounts ranging from half a gram to 3
grams, court papers showed.
</P>
<P>
	   After an order was placed, a delivery person posing as a livery cab driver
would meet the customer at a prearranged location, sometimes the residence of
the customer, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
	   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for White, wouldn't comment on whether
prosecutors were pursuing the customers but said the investigation is
continuing.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the defendants in the case were being held without bail. Another was
held pending a bail hearing later in the week and a fourth was held on $500,000
bail, which his lawyer said he could not afford.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Marc L. Mukasey said the organization's records
showed it made as much as $11,000 in a day.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted, each defendant faces a mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison
and a maximum of life in prison with no parole on conspiracy and drug
distribution charges.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Targeting Teens for Votes  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- One trick to building a campaign crowd: Pack the
school auditorium with a captive audience of students.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a sleight of hand that Bill Bradley could be accused of -- with a
pattern of thin crowds and schools filling his schedule these days -- if not for
the fact that 17- and 18-year-olds are actually part of his strategy for next
Monday's Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can still make this happen,'' Bradley told students Tuesday at West
High School. ``If you support me, I'll love you. If you don't support me, I'll
still love you. But if you did support me, I'd love you a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore, leading in all the Iowa polls, pledged
that he would never let up and would be an ``active, energetic fighting
president'' if Democrats give him the nomination and he is elected.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to fight my heart out for you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spoke to about 200 backers at a college in Indianola before heading to
Knoxville to collect the endorsement of the American Federation of Government
Employees, the latest in his long list of union and other institutional support.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is to receive his first endorsement from a governor on Wednesday --
Oregon's John Kitzhaber. Bradley also picked up support Tuesday from the 3,000
state social workers in the United Electrical Radio Machine Workers of America
who were swayed by Bradley's commitment to eliminating child poverty, union
president Dan Kelley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both candidates later flew to New Hampshire and were returning to Iowa
Thursday to focus on the caucuses until the voting.
</P>
<P>
	   While Gore has drawn sizable crowds of party activists to his recent
campaign stops, Bradley has invested a lot of time speaking to children at
closed-to-the-public events, from Exira Elementary to Atlantic High to a youth
forum on Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   It baffled Exira science and math teacher Marlene Ballou that only faculty
and students were allowed in to the elementary school gym for Bradley's
appearance in that tiny hamlet last week. ``People wanted to come,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   All part of a plan, insisted Pete D'Alasandro, Bradley's Iowa political
director, for Bradley to finish with better than the 31 percent that
Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy took against President Carter in the 1980 Iowa
caucus.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you're going to break through that Kennedy barrier, you've got to turn
to new voters,'' D'Alasandro said.
</P>
<P>
	   Young people can participate in Monday's precinct caucuses as long as
they'll have their 18th birthday in time for the November election. A campaign
aide planned to visit each of West's government classes on Wednesday to seal
commitments.
</P>
<P>
	   But relying on this pool is a dubious strategy, said Elise Schuster, 18, who
is trying to rally her West classmates to Bradley's side before Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``High school students are lazy. They don't want to have to go out of their
way for something they don't think will make a difference in the long run,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Amber Massa, 17, said she will also caucus for Bradley but added, ``I'll
probably go by myself. I don't think my parents are that into it and kids don't
really talk about it that much in the halls.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the corridor after Bradley's speech, one caucus organizer with a
clipboard said he had signed up three parents.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Gore, with the backing of the Democratic Party establishment, has a
lock on Iowa's traditional caucus goers and a double-digit lead in statewide
polls, the Bradley campaign is trying to turn students and other Iowans --
sports fans, for instance, who remember Bradley's basketball career with the New
York Knicks -- into first-time caucus participants.
</P>
<P>
	   To try and demystify the arcane caucus process, the campaign set up a new
Web site where first-timers can log on, identify which precinct they live in,
even watch a video of a mock caucus staged by the Bradley team.
</P>
<P>
	   Anne Greenleaf, a West senior and Bradley campaign volunteer, told her peers
they should caucus with her for Bradley because they'll need a health care plan
like the one he has proposed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As seniors we're going to be going out on our own and affordable health
insurance is an issue. We need affordable insurance for everyone -- not 57
percent or 77 percent, but everyone,'' the girl said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley won hearty applause from West students when he talked of closing
corporate tax loopholes, standing up to the National Rifle Association and
removing the Confederate flag from atop the South Carolina Statehouse.

<HEADLINE> Japan Economy Said To Be Improving  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's central bank said Wednesday that the economy is
improving but that consumers need to spend more to ensure a solid recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bank of Japan's monthly report repeated the previous month's cautiously
optimistic language, saying exports and production are rising and that the
"economic environment surrounding private demand is gradually improving."
</P>
<P>
	   But the January report added that "clear signs of a self-sustained recovery
in private demand have not been observed yet."
</P>
<P>
	   The world's second-largest economy has struggled to pull out of its deepest
slump since the end of World War II. The government has approved record amounts
of public spending to encourage corporate investment and create new jobs, but
recession-weary consumers remain hesitant to open their wallets.
</P>
<P>
	   The central bank blamed that reticence on "severe employment and income
conditions."
</P>
<P>
	   Japan's joblessness rate hit a record 4.9 percent in June as companies
restructured their work forces to remain profitable in a sputtering economy.
Though the rate has since improved, falling to 4.5 percent in November, it
remains high by Japanese standards.
</P>
<P>
	   As for the broader economy, gross domestic product shrank 1 percent in the
July-September quarter from the previous year, bringing to a halt two
consecutive quarters of growth.
</P>
<P>
	   In Wednesday's report, the central bank warned that the steep rise in the
yen against the dollar since the summer poses a near-term threat to profits at
Japanese exporters.
</P>
<P>
	   A stronger yen makes Japanese goods more expensive overseas and can reduce
the yen value of dollar profits repatriated back to Japan.

<HEADLINE> McCain Challenges Bush on Web Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By HOLLY RAMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- John McCain signed a pledge not to tax Internet sales
Tuesday, saying ``we should not harm this baby in the cradle,'' and challenged
George W. Bush to take the same stand. Bush declined and advised New Hampshire
voters to take a critical look at McCain's own tax plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican presidential contenders also took their tax arguments to the
airwaves in new ads. Bush said McCain trusts ``the people of Washington'' rather
than the people of New Hampshire to spend money. McCain said that unlike Bush,
``I won't take every last dime of the surplus and spend it on tax cuts that
mostly benefit the wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Concerning the Internet, Bush said he favored continuing a moratorium on
taxing e-commerce but wanted to know ``what the world looks like'' after three
to five years of further changes before making a long-term decision.
</P>
<P>
	   With Internet commerce generating an estimated $170 billion in revenue last
year, McCain promised to support a permanent ban on taxing access, sales or use.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all know the growth of the Internet is probably the greatest phenomenon
we've seen in our lifetime,'' the Arizona senator said at a Chamber of Commerce
breakfast after signing the pledge drafted by Citizens for a Sound Economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The group's ``e-Freedom Declaration'' asks candidates to support making
permanent the current moratorium on Internet taxes. That moratorium does not
address state sales taxes on e-commerce, which are controlled by a Supreme Court
decision requiring a business to have a physical presence in a state before it
can be forced to collect sales taxes. The principle is the same as for catalogue
sales.
</P>
<P>
	   A congressional panel is also mulling the long-term future of Internet
taxes, including whether to recommend a ban on all sales taxes -- a ban McCain
supports.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I challenge all the candidates, including Governor Bush, to take this
pledge,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he wouldn't be signing the pledge.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to make sure I understand what the world looks like three to five
years from now before I speak further,'' Bush said while campaigning in
Pittsfield.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spent little time on the question, quickly turning the discussion back
to his issue of the week -- comparing his tax cut plan with McCain's.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Two things I'd like to say: I've made it clear that I'm for extending the
moratorium on Internet taxes. The second thing is, Senator McCain needs to
explain his plan to the people, why his raising taxes to the tune of $40 billion
is a tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
	   After criticizing the senator's plan, he said he would always stick by his
own.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's a Washington mindset that says, 'I'll lay out something and
then if it takes on a little water, I'll amend it and keep amending it,''' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's important for the people of this state to analyze everybody's plan,''
he said. He contended that McCain ``has laid out a plan that's going to tax
education benefits, he's going to tax meals for employees (that they're) getting
from their employers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's campaign is rallying business supporters, including high-tech
companies and real estate people, to protest McCain provisions they say would
cut into fringe benefits that are used to attract employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain camp quickly distributed a statement in which he said, ``Governor
Bush is purposely misrepresenting my tax plan.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He and his advisers know my plan will close tax loopholes that
corporations use to write off health spas, sports tickets and free parking for
their top executives and has nothing to do with taxes paid by employees,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   With his tax-cut plan under fire, McCain put off delivering an education
speech this week, but planned to talk about the issue before the Feb. 1 New
Hampshire primary, his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has encountered trouble getting details straight while rolling out
proposals, from health care to taxes -- providing rivals ready targets. But
McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky put a positive spin on the delayed education
rollout, saying it would force the Bush camp ``to continue to defend their (tax)
plan which doesn't devote a penny to Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, McCain has proposed cutting taxes by $237 billion over five years.
He has said it is irresponsible to cut taxes further until the financial future
of Social Security and Medicare are taken care of.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's plan would deliver a five-year, $483 billion tax cut. He says the
only way to be certain that projected budget surpluses are not spent by the
federal government is to refund most of the money to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, while campaigning on Tuesday, cut a new TV ad to air later in the
evening emphasizing his differences with McCain on taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My opponent trusts the people of Washington to spend money. I trust the
people of New Hampshire to make the right decisions for their family,'' Bush
says in the ``crash ad'' spot. ``If he says something I don't agree with I'm
going to point it out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, McCain makes his case in a 30-second ad that began airing over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's one big difference between me and the others. I won't take every
last dime of the surplus and spend it on tax cuts that mostly benefit the
wealthy,'' McCain says. He mentions his plans to put money into Social Security
and to pay down the national debt and concludes: ``I'll target the large tax
cuts to those who need it most, America's middle-class working families.''

Canada To Help Its NHL Teams -- if Others Do, Too
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Industry Minister John Manley, admitting to mixed emotions
about giving public money to pro hockey, nevertheless decided Tuesday he can't
run the risk of Canada losing its big-league teams.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Canadians are divided about the issue,'' Manley acknowledged as he
announced the federal government will offer millions in subsidies to the
country's six NHL clubs.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition politicians argued there are more important things to spend money
on.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you're a patient in an ambulance going from hospital to hospital, or a
farmer in the West facing bankruptcy, it's pretty difficult to see that this is
on the same scale,'' said Reform MP Grant Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   Manley cautioned federal cash will flow to NHL clubs only if provinces,
municipalities and the league also participate in the bailout and agree to foot
most of the bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Ottawa will cap its contribution at 25 per cent of the total.
</P>
<P>
	   The minister put no dollar figure on the federal aid, saying it will be
tailored to the individual needs of each team.
</P>
<P>
	   But he noted Ottawa Senators owner Rod Bryden -- a well-connected Liberal
who led the campaign for subsidies -- has said his franchise alone needs $10
million to $12 million annually.
</P>

Supreme Court Hears Arguments on Child Porn Laws
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- The rights of children were pitted against privacy and
freedom of expression Tuesday in a Supreme Court hearing aimed at resolving a
protracted dispute over Canada's child pornography laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 15 lawyers stood before the high court to argue their position on
whether the court should uphold laws prohibiting possession of child porn.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute centers on whether the law, which prohibits possession of
material that depicts minors in a sexual manner or advocates sexual activity
with them, justifiably limits charter rights in the name of protecting children.
</P>
<P>
	   About 50 protesters carried placards and sang the national anthem outside as
British Columbia kicked off the day, saying the law is ``essential if children
are to be fully protected.''
</P>
<P>
	   Vancouver resident Robin Sharpe, accused of possession, successfully
challenged the law last year in two British Columbia courts on the basis that it
violates the Charter of Rights.
</P>
<P>

Study Finds Little Improvement for Women Workers
</P>
<P>
	   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Companies have squandered time and money on gender
equality programs in the workplace because women continue to be underpaid, do
the grunt work and hold few executive positions, authors of a Calgary-based
study said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Policies in the last 20 years have not been effective,'' said Allan
Cahoon, co-author of a University of Calgary study of 142,000 employees of 1,500
Calgary businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The study of 64,000 women and 78,000 men suggests the female work force
decreased by 10 per cent between 1994 and 1998. The women either started their
own businesses, took part-time jobs or left for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   After conducting the study every four years for the last two decades, the
researchers found continuing unfairness for women in the workplace, which Cahoon
said is indicative of all Canadian communities.
</P>

Federal Panel: Reduce Catch Limits for Newfoundland Cod
</P>
<P>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) -- Newfoundland's cod fishery, once thought to
be on the rebound after seven years of rebuilding, was dealt a major setback
Tuesday by a federal advisory body.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fisheries Resource Conservation Council, which advises federal Fisheries
Minister Herb Dhaliwal, says catch limits for cod landed on the province's south
coast in 2000-2001 should be slashed by one third.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The rebuilding we thought was under way in the cod stock on the south
coast of Newfoundland is no longer apparent,'' the council said in a gloomy
statement released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The council recommends the total allowable catch for the area, known as 3PS,
should be reduced to 20,000 tons from 30,000 tons
</P>
<P>
	   The smaller catch limit, if approved, will hack $30 million from
Newfoundland's diversified $900-million fishery, said Earle McCurdy, president
of the Fish, Food and Allied Workers union.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
Finance Minister's Prudence on Budget Is Faulted
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Canadians can't afford Finance Minister Paul Martin's budget
jitters and would rather see his multibillion-dollar prudence funds used for tax
cuts and support for children, a social policy think-tank said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In his five-year budget projections that call for a total $95-billion
surplus, Martin has set aside $28 billion to protect the federal books from
running into the red.
</P>
<P>
	   But Martin should quit worrying so much and use that money now to improve
the lives of people with modest incomes, says the study by the Caledon Institute
of Social Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin could use the money to reindex taxes to inflation, reduce taxes for
low- and middle-income earners, improve the Canadian Child Tax Benefit and set
up a national child development fund, the institute argues.
</P>
<P>
	   If that means running small deficits occasionally, that's more of a symbolic
problem than a real concern, it adds.
</P>

Military Is Bracing for Helicopter Rescue Cutbacks
</P>
<P>
	   HALIFAX (AP) -- Military brass are bracing for a rescue gap this year as the
shrunken fleet of search-and-rescue helicopters is pushed to the limit with no
hope of replacement choppers for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're stretched to the max right now,'' Lt.-Col. Charlie Cue, the Defence
Department's senior staff officer for search-and-rescue, said from Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No matter how we cut this, the level of search-and-rescue service at some
point in time . . . will probably decrease.''
</P>
<P>
	   The air force operates four search-and-rescue squadrons that rely heavily on
twin-rotor Labradors, in Gander, Newfoundland, Greenwood, Nova Scotia, Trenton,
Ontario, and Comox, British Columbia
</P>
<P>
	   The system requires 15 helicopters: three at each squadron to ensure they're
ready to fly 24 hours a day, two at a training school in Comox, and one always
undergoing an eight-month overhaul at a Boeing facility in Arnprior, Ontario
</P>
<P>
	   But crashes have culled the fleet to 12 aircraft which has forced the
military to cut corners and placed enormous pressure on maintenance crews to
keep the aging choppers in the air.

<HEADLINE> Whitman signs bill protecting cancer, surgery patients from HMO  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - HMOs and other insurers can no longer force cancer
and surgery patients or pregnant women to switch doctors because of changes in
insurance contracts.
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman signed a law Tuesday to make certain that patients can
stick with the same doctor even if the doctor severs his relationship with an
insurance company during the course of treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   "Patients with major illnesses have had their managed-care providers tell
them they had to change doctors or change health plans. That's not fair," said
Sen. Joseph Vitale, D-Middlesex, a prime sponsor. "People undergoing medical
procedures face enough trauma without having insurers force them to start seeing
a new doctor at a critical time."
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Langevin, director of the New Jersey Association of Health Plans, said
these sorts of sudden changes to patient treatment do not occur now, and the law
will impose needless new regulations on insurers.
</P>
<P>
	   Langevin said state regulations already provide for a four-month grace
period to allow a seamless transition to a new doctor when required. He said the
law signed Tuesday changes this grace period to a year.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was hoping that they would stand by their regulations that we worked on
in 1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Langevin said the new law is too vague and puts insurers in a bind because
they will be dealing with doctors with whom they no longer have a legal
relationship, depriving them of the means to control treatment, accountability
and cost.
</P>
<P>
	   The law also applies to surgery patients who require a period of
post-operative care.
</P>
<P>
	   While the sponsors said this provision is limited to patients with serious
long-term cases, Langevin said it would apply to thousands of patients who have
had minor surgeries and have no real need for such continuity.

<HEADLINE> Computer Cabinets Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Ohio furniture maker is recalling about 212,400
computer cabinets after receiving reports of injuries caused by the upper doors
falling off.
</P>
<P>
	   Sauder Woodworking Co. has received 143 reports of the upper door or parts
of the door falling off, resulting in 17 injuries including a broken toe, cuts,
scratches and bruises, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The recall involves the Monarch style computer armoire, models 2549 in
washed pine finish, 2649 in woodland oak finish, 2749 in classic cherry finish,
8449 in fruitwood finish and 9649 in amber oak finish. The cabinets measure
about 41.5 inches wide, 23 inches deep and 73 inches high with the doors closed.
</P>
<P>
	   Two upper doors open to reveal areas for a printer, monitor and keyboard.
Two lower rollaway doors open to provide additional work surfaces and a file
drawer. ``Sauder'' is imprinted into two metal strike plates, located in the
corners of the upper doors. The model number is located on a sticker that the
consumer attached to the armoire or in the assembly instruction book.
</P>
<P>
	   Department, office and furniture stores nationwide sold these computer
armoires from July 1997 through December 1999 for about $450.
</P>
<P>
	   The safety commission advises consumers to stop using the cabinets
immediately and order a free repair kit by calling Sauder toll-free at
1-888-800-6315 between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. EST Monday through Friday and between
9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Saturday. The repair kit includes safety brackets for
installation on both doors and installation instructions.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- John McCain signed a pledge not to tax Internet sales
Tuesday, saying ``we should not harm this baby in the cradle,'' and challenged
George W. Bush to take the same stand. Bush declined and advised New Hampshire
voters to take a critical look at McCain's own tax plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican presidential contenders also took their tax arguments to the
airwaves in new ads. Bush said McCain trusts ``the people of Washington'' rather
than the people of New Hampshire to spend money. McCain said that unlike Bush,
``I won't take every last dime of the surplus and spend it on tax cuts that
mostly benefit the wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Concerning the Internet, Bush said he favored continuing a moratorium on
taxing e-commerce but wanted to know ``what the world looks like'' after three
to five years of further changes before making a long-term decision.
</P>
<P>
	   With Internet commerce generating an estimated $170 billion in revenue last
year, McCain promised to support a permanent ban on taxing access, sales or use.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all know the growth of the Internet is probably the greatest phenomenon
we've seen in our lifetime,'' the Arizona senator said at a Chamber of Commerce
breakfast after signing the pledge drafted by Citizens for a Sound Economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The group's ``e-Freedom Declaration'' asks candidates to support making
permanent the current moratorium on Internet taxes. That moratorium does not
address state sales taxes on e-commerce, which are controlled by a Supreme Court
decision requiring a business to have a physical presence in a state before it
can be forced to collect sales taxes. The principle is the same as for catalogue
sales.
</P>
<P>
	   A congressional panel is also mulling the long-term future of Internet
taxes, including whether to recommend a ban on all sales taxes -- a ban McCain
supports.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I challenge all the candidates, including Governor Bush, to take this
pledge,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he wouldn't be signing the pledge.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to make sure I understand what the world looks like three to five
years from now before I speak further,'' Bush said while campaigning in
Pittsfield.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spent little time on the question, quickly turning the discussion back
to his issue of the week -- comparing his tax cut plan with McCain's.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Two things I'd like to say: I've made it clear that I'm for extending the
moratorium on Internet taxes. The second thing is, Senator McCain needs to
explain his plan to the people, why his raising taxes to the tune of $40 billion
is a tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
	   After criticizing the senator's plan, he said he would always stick by his
own.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's a Washington mindset that says, 'I'll lay out something and
then if it takes on a little water, I'll amend it and keep amending it,''' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's important for the people of this state to analyze everybody's plan,''
he said. He contended that McCain ``has laid out a plan that's going to tax
education benefits, he's going to tax meals for employees (that they're) getting
from their employers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's campaign is rallying business supporters, including high-tech
companies and real estate people, to protest McCain provisions they say would
cut into fringe benefits that are used to attract employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain camp quickly distributed a statement in which he said, ``Governor
Bush is purposely misrepresenting my tax plan.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He and his advisers know my plan will close tax loopholes that
corporations use to write off health spas, sports tickets and free parking for
their top executives and has nothing to do with taxes paid by employees,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   With his tax-cut plan under fire, McCain put off delivering an education
speech this week, but planned to talk about the issue before the Feb. 1 New
Hampshire primary, his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has encountered trouble getting details straight while rolling out
proposals, from health care to taxes -- providing rivals ready targets. But
McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky put a positive spin on the delayed education
rollout, saying it would force the Bush camp ``to continue to defend their (tax)
plan which doesn't devote a penny to Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, McCain has proposed cutting taxes by $237 billion over five years.
He has said it is irresponsible to cut taxes further until the financial future
of Social Security and Medicare are taken care of.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's plan would deliver a five-year, $483 billion tax cut. He says the
only way to be certain that projected budget surpluses are not spent by the
federal government is to refund most of the money to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, while campaigning on Tuesday, cut a new TV ad to air later in the
evening emphasizing his differences with McCain on taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My opponent trusts the people of Washington to spend money. I trust the
people of New Hampshire to make the right decisions for their family,'' Bush
says in the ``crash ad'' spot. ``If he says something I don't agree with I'm
going to point it out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, McCain makes his case in a 30-second ad that began airing over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's one big difference between me and the others. I won't take every
last dime of the surplus and spend it on tax cuts that mostly benefit the
wealthy,'' McCain says. He mentions his plans to put money into Social Security
and to pay down the national debt and concludes: ``I'll target the large tax
cuts to those who need it most, America's middle-class working families.''

<HEADLINE> Syria Parties Deride Israel Tactics  </HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SEVAREID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Leaders of Syria's political parties condemned
Israeli negotiating tactics Tuesday following a briefing by their chief
negotiator, Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli team has been trying to dodge requirements of peace, the Central
Leadership for the National Progressive Front said in a reference to Syria's
complaint that Israel was unwilling to set new borders that would return the
Golan Heights border plateau.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Progressive Front is a coalition of seven political parties led
by the ruling Baath party. Its role is primarily to support the policies of
President Hafez Assad, the sole authority in Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's negotiating style is ``not the one that could lead to just and
comprehensive peace,'' the coalition said in its first statement since talks
scheduled for Wednesday in the United States were postponed.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria has said it will not return to talks until Israel is prepared to
commit to fully withdraw from the Golan, which Israel has occupied since the
1967 Mideast War. Syria, Israel and the United States have indicated they expect
negotiations will resume but have not said how soon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Israeli government is fully responsible for the present status of the
peace talks, and this situation cannot change unless the Israeli government is
ready to affirm the ... withdrawal from the occupied Golan to June 4, 1967,
borders,'' the coalition statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the gloomy assessment, some Syrians expressed confidence Tuesday
that Israel would agree to Syria's condition for resuming talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria had laid out its single requirement for resolving all other issues
even before negotiations aimed at ending 50 years of hostilities began last
month. So, after two rounds of talks and no pledge to return the Golan, Naym
Jabri said it wasn't much of a surprise to hear that the third round was
indefinitely postponed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everything is clear. Syria is clear on what it wants -- the Golan Heights
completely,'' said Jabri, a 34-year-old professor at Damascus University's
Faculty of Fine Arts. ``And if the other side will confirm this, then the peace
will be a reality.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright blamed neither side for the
postponement, saying their approaches differed toward a U.S.-prepared document
that the Americans had hoped would form a basis for an accord.
</P>
<P>
	   Samir Ziadi, a 38-year-old chef, said the United States appears to be
pressing Israel to accept Syria's position on withdrawal. He is sure such a
commitment eventually will come.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course Israel will have to agree to return the Golan Heights -- this is
our land,'' Ziadi said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, Deputy Defense Minister Efraim Sneh accused the Syrians of
inflexibility, and told reporters Israel was not pressed to return to the
negotiating table. ``We want to reach an agreement, but not at all costs, and we
are not in a hurry,'' Sneh said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel has insisted on knowing what sort of security guarantees and
peacetime relations it will get before considering new borders.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: N. Korea Poses Missile Threat  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nuclear powers Russia and China are the most vocal
opponents of a proposed U.S. national missile defense, but it is North Korea --
economically destitute, politically isolated and militarily hostile -- that
Clinton administration officials say poses the most immediate missile threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Thus the initial version of a national missile defense, as envisioned by
Pentagon planners, would be designed mainly to counter a small-scale attack from
North Korea. More robust defenses might be added later to shield American
territory from missile attacks by other so-called rogue nations, such as Iraq or
Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton may decide as early as this summer whether to proceed with
a national missile defense, which the Pentagon estimates will cost at least
$12.7 billion over the next five years. It could be ready for use by 2005,
although many officials involved in the program believe that may be too
ambitious.
</P>
<P>
	   An important test of the missile interceptor -- the centerpiece of a U.S.
defense system -- was set for Tuesday night. The interceptor was to be launched
from a U.S. Army missile range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific Ocean in an
attempt to shoot down a mock warhead carried into space atop a converted
Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile launched from Vandenberg Air
Force Base, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   If the interceptor, called a ``kill vehicle,'' succeeded in hitting the
target warhead -- and if all of the radar, communications and other technical
aspects of the test worked correctly -- then the Pentagon would have met its
self-defined minimum standard for recommending that the system is feasible to
deploy, spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. An initial test last October resulted in a
successful intercept.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we just have to wait until all the results are in and see how they
mesh together before we can say it's a successful integrated systems test,''
Bacon told reporters before the scheduled start of the test.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a dozen protesters held a vigil outside Vandenberg Air Force Base
on Tuesday to protest the missile test.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were all holding up signs protesting this wrongheaded thing our
government is doing,'' said Bud Boothe, 74, a member of the Global Network
Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in Space. The group opposes space-based
weapons systems, which it claims violates a United Nations treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia is concerned that a U.S. missile defense system would undermine the
deterrent value of its nuclear missile arsenal, as is China.
</P>
<P>
	   John Hamre, the deputy U.S. defense secretary, said Tuesday that Russia and
China need not worry about the U.S. system, which would be designed to counter
limited missile attacks from ``rogue'' countries like North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview in his Pentagon office, Hamre said North Korea is a
legitimate source of worry about a surprise missile attack, since it has
invested heavily in developing a long-range missile capability, even though no
one is threatening it and even while many of its people are starving.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no rational reason why North Korea, with the economic straits
that they are in, would choose such a provocative thing to do,'' Hamre said.
``This is a country that doesn't care about the opinion of the international
community,'' and therefore must be judged capable of attacking the United States
unprovoked.

<HEADLINE> Col. Becomes Guatemala Minister  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Guatemala's new president named a colonel Tuesday as
the country's defense minister, raising the likelihood of a military shake-up in
which higher-ranking generals would be forced into retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   Col. Juan de Dios Estrada took on his new post in a ceremony attended by
President Alfonso Portillo Cabrera. He succeeds Gen. Marco Tulio Espinosa, who
had led the ministry since June 1999 and now automatically passes into
retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   Given that a colonel is barred from giving orders to higher-ranking
officers, military law would require Guatemala's other 19 generals to retire as
well in order to maintain the order of hierarchy. The Defense Ministry, however,
made no announcement on the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   Portillo, who took power Friday, has said he plans to name a civilian to
head the ministry and proposed that Congress revise laws in order to make it
possible.
</P>
<P>
	   Portillo, a former Marxist scholar, is closely allied with a Guatemala's
former rightist dictator, Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, who is head of Portillo's
party and the new president of Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Human rights groups claim that the army under Rios Montt carried out
widespread massacres during a scorched-earth campaign against leftist rebels in
northern Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
	   But Portillo has tried to escape that shadow, criticizing past rights abuses
by the military.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, a U.N. truth commission appointed to seek reconciliation after
Guatemala's 36-year civil war blamed the army for the vast majority of the
200,000 deaths and disappearances that occurred during the conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission, created under 1996 peace accords, recommended the government
remove military officers found to have participated in atrocities.

<HEADLINE> Major announcement expected in 1975 murder of Greenwich teen-ager  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - More than 24 years after Greenwich teen-ager
Martha Moxley was found beaten to death with a golf club, an arrest warrant has
been signed for a suspect in the killing, the Connecticut Post reported in a
story prepared for Wednesday's editions.
<P>
	   Prosecutors refused to comment on the suspect Tuesday. But Michael Skakel, a
nephew of the late U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was the focus of an 18-month
grand jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel's lawyer, Michael Sherman, said Skakel continues to maintain his
innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   "Regardless of the grand jury's recommendations or actions, he has been and
will continue to be innocent of any wrongdoing here," Sherman said late Tuesday.
"He's obviously very anxious about having this matter resolved, and he's looking
forward to being exonerated, whether it be tomorrow or sometime after that."
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors scheduled a news conference for 9 a.m. Wednesday to announce the
results of the grand jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Connecticut Post, quoting unnamed sources in Bridgeport Superior Court,
did not identify what suspect is named in the arrest warrant, but said the
warrant was based on a finding of probable cause by the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman said he has prepared Skakel for his possible arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they elect to do that, he will appear (in court), he will plead not
guilty, he will go to trial and he will be acquitted," Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict is expected to
release a report from Superior Court Judge George Thim, who has investigated the
case for the last 18 months as a one-man grand jury. Thim's report was filed
Tuesday under seal.
</P>
<P>
	   Thim's investigation focused on Skakel, who at the time of the killing was a
15-year-old neighbor of Moxley's. Skakel is the son of Rushton Skakel Sr., who
is the brother of Ethel Kennedy, the widow of U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
	   On the night of her death, Oct. 30, 1975, Ms. Moxley had visited the Skakel
home, along with several other teen-agers after a night of pre-Halloween pranks.
Her body was found the next day under some low-hanging fir trees on her family's
estate, located across the street from the Skakel estate.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after the killing, the 6-iron used to kill her was matched to a set
owned by the Skakel family. But no one was ever arrested in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Michael Skakel, and his older brother Thomas Skakel, then 17, were
looked at possible suspects, along with others, including Kenneth Littleton, a
tutor who had just moved into the Skakel house the day of the killing.
</P>
<P>
	   After more than two decades of dead ends, Thim was appointed as a grand
juror in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Once Thim began calling witnesses, it quickly became clear that Michael
Skakel was the focus of the probe, even though the proceedings are held in
secret.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors filed court documents in which they claimed Skakel had made
"admissions as to the murder of Martha Moxley" when he lived at a school and
substance abuse treatment center from 1978 to 1980. Prosecutors said he made the
admissions to fellow students at the Elan school in Poland Spring, Maine. Thim
heard testimony from former students at the school behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
	   Littleton was eliminated as a suspect after he was granted immunity from
prosecution in August 1998, after he testified before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Thim's 18-month investigation ended on Dec. 10. He had 60 days from that
date to file his written report.
</P>
<P>
	   Martha's mother, Dorthy Moxley, said prosecutors had informed her of the
news conference, but would not tell her whether an arrest warrant was being
sought for Skakel.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am hopeful," she said. "I have prayed for this for so long."

<HEADLINE> Miami Attorney Is ABC 'Millionaire'  </HEADLINE>
    By FRAZIER MOORE AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- He knew the distance from the Earth to the Sun. Now Dan
Blonsky is shining as the second contestant to go all the way on ABC's "Who
Wants to be a Millionaire."
</P>
<P>
	   Blonsky, a 34-year-old Miami attorney, won the top prize on the
"Millionaire" episode that aired Tuesday night, after having been brought on
late in Sunday's edition. Both segments of the New York-based game show were
taped Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Blonsky takes his place behind John Carpenter, the Connecticut man who in
November became the first "Millionaire" jackpot winner.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm happy to be the Buzz Aldrin of game-show millionaires, not the Neil
Armstrong," Blonsky said from his office Tuesday, taking a break from work for a
teleconference.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the questions he was asked seemed harder than contestants used to
face, but he denied being nervous. "My heart beats faster waiting for a jury
verdict," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   His 15th and final correct answer was in response to the question: The Earth
is approximately how many miles from the Sun? A. 9.3 million; B. 39 million; C.
93 million; D. 193 million. Fortunately, he chose C.
</P>
<P>
	   Blonsky, who used all three of his allotted "lifelines," said he was stumped
by the $500,000 question, which asked who appeared on the first cover of People
magazine. But he rang up a partner in his law firm as his "phone-a-friend," and
Jeff Crockett steered him toward the right response: Mia Farrow.
</P>
<P>
	   For that assistance, Blonsky said he would cut Crockett in on his payday.
</P>
<P>
	   Otherwise, plans were sketchy from the newly flush bachelor. "I go to Las
Vegas every year, so I'll probably wager a little more than I usually bet," he
ventured. "And I'll have some better doodads around the house."
</P>
<P>
	   Airing nightly for two weeks in August, "Millionaire," with host Regis
Philbin, was an instant hit. Then during an 18-night run in November, it helped
ABC to win the "sweeps" month.
</P>
<P>
	   Returning this month with an eight-night marathon, the show claimed seven
slots in last week's Nielsen ratings Top 10 -- including first place for
Wednesday's show. It continues on an open-ended run, airing Sunday, Tuesday and
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Long-Term Care Credit To Be Offered  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, resurrecting an initiative that died
in Congress last year, will propose up to $3,000 in tax credits to help 2
million Americans struggling to provide long-term care for elderly or disabled
relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   The tax credit would be triple the size of last year's failed proposal and
would cost $28 billion over 10 years. It will be announced on Wednesday as part
of Clinton's buildup to his Jan. 27 State of the Union address. An
election-minded Congress will decide whether to enact it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we've got to deal with the aging of America,'' Clinton said
Tuesday night in Boston. ``We've got to decide what were going to do with Social
Security and Medicare, how we're going to prepare for this explosion in the
number of people over 65.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president also will propose spending $1.25 billion over 10 years for
local agencies that support family caregivers with counseling, training and care
techniques. The money would be awarded to state and local ``agencies on aging,''
created by the 1965 Older Americans Act.
</P>
<P>
	   White House officials believe they have a better chance of passing the plan
this year because health care has become a hot issue in the presidential
campaign as the baby boom generation moves toward retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats and Republicans alike are talking about proposals for prescription
drug coverage under Medicare, health coverage initiatives, a patients' bill of
rights, drugs over the Internet, long-term care and other programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a growing recognition of the demographics facing this country,
particularly on long-term care,'' said White House health policy adviser Chris
Jennings. ``There's a growing momentum and a recognition that there's a lot of
unmet health care needs, and this is one of them. The president believes there's
a very good chance we can get this thing done.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Clinton proposed a $1,000 tax credit for long-term care needs.
The measure drew bipartisan support but did not make its way through Congress as
the president fought with Republicans over tax cuts and ultimately vetoed their
$792 billion tax-cut plan. This year, Republicans say they will offer a far more
modest package of targeted tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, in his final budget proposal before leaving office, tripled the
size of the proposed long-term care tax credit this year at the urging of senior
groups and health policy advocates, Jennings said.
</P>
<P>
	   If enacted, the credit would be phased in beginning with $1,000 in 2001,
rising in $500 increments so that eligible people would receive $3,000 in 2005.
The credit would be phased out beginning at $110,000 in income for families and
$75,000 for unmarried taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House said the credit would help about 2 million Americans,
including 1.2 million older Americans, more than 500,000 non-elderly adults and
approximately 250,000 children.
</P>
<P>
	   While difficult to quantify, the economic value of caregiving for families
ranges from $4,800 to $10,400 per caregiver, according to one study cited by the
White House. Thus, the proposed $3,000 tax credit could cover up to 60 percent
of families' costs.

<HEADLINE> Citigroup Profits Up 86 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Citigroup Inc. saw profits soar 86 percent in the fourth
quarter, topping Wall Street's most optimistic estimates. Strong fees from its
investment banking and Citibank helped boost the bottom-line results at the
nation's largest bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Underscoring the role investment banking will play in Citigroup's future,
the company said Tuesday it will spend $2.2 billion to acquire Schroder PLC's
investment banking division in London.
</P>
<P>
	   Citigroup, which owns Salomon Smith Barney, has made a big push in corporate
financial services, including underwriting stocks and bonds and advising
companies on mergers and acquisitions. Salomon Smith Barney was involved in some
of last year's biggest deals, including MCI WorldCom's purchase of Sprint.
</P>
<P>
	   The acquisition of Schroder's London-based investment banking business will
double Salomon Smith Barney's presence in Europe. The new division, which will
be called Schroders Salomon Smith Barney, however, will still pale when compared
with its large U.S. rivals, like Goldman Sachs, which dominate European deals.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is a good base for them to build from," said Diana Yates, an analyst
with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
	   Citigroup signaled that it also plans to expand in the insurance and
brokerage industries in the United States. New legislation signed late last year
eliminated the barriers that separated banks from other financial service
industries.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our exceptionally strong capital position and the successful integration of
our global businesses will enable us to take full advantage of the new financial
modernization legislation in the coming year," the company said in a statement.
"This legislation opens up new horizons for our company and will facilitate our
expansion in the global financial services arena."
</P>
<P>
	   Citigroup's shares dipped 50 cents to $58.50 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the
New York Stock Exchange as investors worried that the Federal Reserve might soon
raise interest rates, which could hurt bank profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Citigroup's fourth-quarter profits from operations totaled $2.61 billion, or
75 cents a share, beating the analysts' average estimate of 70 cents a share, as
well as the highest estimate of 73 cents, according to First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   In the fourth quarter of 1998, Citigroup had profits of $1.4 billion, or 40
cents a share, excluding one-time charges and gains. If those items are
included, Citigroup had net income of $677 million, or 19 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue for the quarter was $1.53 billion, up 15 percent from $1.33 billion
in the fourth quarter 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "Across the board everything looked pretty strong," Yates said. "The drivers
being the rebound in their corporate bank, the Salomon Smith Barney investment
bank, and the $2 billion in expenses they have taken out."
</P>
<P>
	   Corporate and investment banking business more than doubled to $1.31 billion
from $553 million, led by strong fees from its Salomon Smith Barney brokerage
and investment bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Citigroup's revenue from its banking and lending operations totaled $612
million, up 43 percent from $429 million in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, the New York-based company had profits from operations of
$9.95 billion, or $2.85 a share, up from $6.34 billion or $1.77 a share in the
previous year. Including one-time items, net income totaled $9.87 billion, or
$2.83 a share, vs. $5.81 billion, or $1.62 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Full-year revenue came to $5.95 billion, up from $5.11 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think the outlook for 2000 is also very good at this point in time,"
said Sandy Weill, co-chairman and co-chief executive.

<HEADLINE> Californians Split on Death Penalty  </HEADLINE>
   By BOB EGELKO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Defying conventional wisdom, a new poll says
Californians are evenly divided between death and life without parole as the
proper punishment for first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey, by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California,
contrasts with polls that have consistently shown support of about 3-1 for
capital punishment, both statewide and nationwide. Those polls have simply asked
respondents whether they favored or opposed the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   The Public Policy Institute poll asked whether they thought the penalty for
first-degree murder should be death or ``life imprisonment with absolutely no
possibility of parole.'' Those are the two choices for a jury in the penalty
phase of a capital case.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty-nine percent chose death, 47 percent chose life and the rest were
undecided. The poll, based on telephone interviews with 2,007 randomly chosen
Californians between Jan. 2 and Jan. 10, had a margin of error of plus or minus
2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   When the same question was asked nationally by the Gallup Organization in
February, 56 percent favored the death penalty compared to 38 percent for life
without parole, said Mark Baldassare, the Public Policy Institute poll director.
</P>
<P>
	   He said a single poll is not enough to signal a statewide shift in public
opinion, but suggests at least that ``opinions are not as hard on this issue as
we might have thought they were.''
</P>
<P>
	   California has more than 550 people on death row and has executed seven
since resuming capital punishment in 1992 after a 25-year lapse.

<HEADLINE> Angola Rebel Tied to Downed Planes  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT NEUMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Two Angolan rebel defectors are claiming that their
former leader personally ordered the downing of two U.N. aircraft a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. Security Council members listened to the allegations Tuesday in
videotape of the former Angolan rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   The video presentation was made by Canadian Ambassador Robert Fowler, who
chairs the U.N. sanctions committee on Angola's UNITA rebels. He returned from a
fact-finding mission to the southern African nation Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The two U.N.-chartered planes were shot down on Dec. 26, 1998 and Jan. 2,
1999. The two defectors, both former rebel commanders, said in separate
interviews that UNITA's top leader, Jonas Savimbi, ordered the attacks. In
total, the two planes were carrying 23 people.
</P>
<P>
	   The fate of the crew remains unclear. In November, rebels reiterated an
earlier claim that the crew members were alive and being held by the rebel
group, according to a U.N. report Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   However, one ex-rebel said on the videotape that there were no survivors
from either crash, and that UNITA leaders had ordered that any traces of the
bodies be burned or destroyed. The rebel forces had standing orders to shoot
down any plane flying over rebel-held territory, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Savimbi issued orders ... to shoot down any aircraft of the United
Nations,'' another former rebel officer said in the video, in which Fowler
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
	   Fowler said the former guerrilla commanders, now members of the Angolan
army, did not appear to be speaking under duress or at the behest of the
government. He said he hoped that the information about the crash could be
corroborated, but admitted that ``the trail now is very cold.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the United Nations was still assessing
Fowler's report and didn't know what, if any, legal recourse the organization
might have.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebel commanders also said UNITA funded its war by selling diamonds to
international arms dealers for all types of weapons, including tanks, armored
personnel carriers, cannons, mortars, and rocket launchers.
</P>
<P>
	   In an attempt to strangle the rebel war effort, the United Nations has an
arms and fuel embargo on UNITA and a ban on rebel diamond exports. Diamond sales
are estimated to have supplied the rebels with up to $4 billion since 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Angola's civil war erupted shortly after Angola won independence from
Portugal in 1975. The United Nations has spent millions of dollars over the past
decade in an effort to bring peace to Angola. In 1994, the government and UNITA
signed a U.N.-mediated cease-fire agreement known as the Lusaka Protocol.
</P>
<P>
	   But U.N. peacekeepers withdrew from the country last February after fighting
between the government and the rebels resumed in December 1998.

<HEADLINE> Indian Protesters Reach Quito  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Slipping by military highway patrols, thousands of
highland Indian protesters, including women and children in ragged clothing,
reached the capital Tuesday as the to demand the resignation of embattled
President Jamil Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
	   The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador, which represents
the country's 4 million Indians, has organized what it calls an ``indigenous
uprising,'' which includes blockading highways and a march on Quito by at least
10,000 Indians.
</P>
<P>
	   After sleeping and resting most of the day at a park near the downtown, some
5,000 Indians marched peacefully toward Congress, located two blocks away, but
were turned back by police barricades.
</P>
<P>
	   They continued their march along nearby streets, chanting anti-Mahuad
slogans in Spanish and the Quichua Indian language, before returning to the
park. The march stretched six blocks long and caused traffic jams during the
evening rush hour.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have come to found a new Ecuador conceived from an indigenous
viewpoint,'' said Antonio Vargas, president of the Indian confederation.
</P>
<P>
	   Two Indian healers dressed in traditional clothing and sandals burned leaves
and herbs to mark ``the beginning of a new era.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indian leaders have set Wednesday as the day of the symbolic ``capture'' of
Quito, Ecuador's capital, by thousands of Indian protesters. Leaders at one
point had said 40,000 Indians would take part but have since scaled back the
figure to 10,000.
</P>
<P>
	   They are demanding Mahuad's resignation, accusing him of failing to end
Ecuador's economic crisis, including a 60 percent inflation rate, the highest in
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indians also say Mahuad should go because of his plan to make the U.S.
dollar Ecuador's official currency in a bid to halt inflation and stabilize the
economy. Their leaders charge the step will impoverish even further the 7
million poor people in Ecuador's population of 12 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The government deployed 35,000 soldiers and police to patrol the country's
major highways to block Indians who live in isolated highland villages from
reaching Quito.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the patrols by security forces, hundreds of Indians appeared at dawn
Tuesday in Quito, located 9,400 feet high in the Andes, and began gathering at a
large park near downtown. Throughout the day they continued to filter into the
park in small groups.
</P>
<P>
	   An Indian leader, who refused to give his name, said the Indians from his
village had walked all night through the mountains, avoiding highways.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have come to Quito to stay until Jamil goes back to his home,'' the
leader said.
</P>
<P>
	   Indians from other mountain villages said they had arrived on buses and had
managed to get by military blockades by telling soldiers they were on their way
to towns near the capital to attend religious festivals and other events.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indians who gathered in El Arbolito park, 20 blocks from the government
palace, included men, women and children in tattered clothing and ponchos.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday groups of Indians blocked highways in eight of Ecuador's 22
provinces, the latest in a series of anti-Mahuad protests. Security forces
quickly cleared the roads without violence.
</P>
<P>
	   The government on Jan. 5 declared a state of emergency, empowering the armed
forces to control the growing public protests.

<HEADLINE> Jones Fined for License Violation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BENTON, Ark. (AP) -- Paula Jones pleaded guilty Tuesday to driving on a
suspended California driver's license and was fined $275.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Jones pleaded innocent to the charge in August but changed her plea
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In June, a state trooper stopped Mrs. Jones on Interstate 30 near Benton,
southwest of Little Rock, after noticing that her 1993 Mercedes Benz had a
broken tail light.
</P>
<P>
	   She was cited for driving with a suspended license after a check showed that
her California driver's license had been suspended for failure to appear on a
misdemeanor charge.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, California police said Mrs. Jones owed $970 in traffic fines in
Long Beach and her license would be no good until the fines were paid.
</P>
<P>
	   The Long Beach police said in August that the fine was paid in full.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Jones was cited in 1998 in California for driving with an expired
license plate, without car insurance and without a valid California license.
Police said she appeared in November 1998 in Long Beach court after being cited
on the three violations and was granted an extension to Jan. 5, 1999. A hold was
placed on her license after she failed to appear or contact the court.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, Mrs. Jones accused President Clinton of making a sexual advance
toward her in a Little Rock hotel room in 1991 while he was governor and she was
a state employee. She agreed to an $850,000 out-of-court settlement in 1998. Her
share was $201,000, with the remainder going to lawyers.

   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- U.S. Coast Guard aircraft and
Dominican navy ships searched for more victims Tuesday from a migrant boat
sinking that claimed at least 13 lives.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-three people survived the accident, which occurred Sunday off Bavaro,
90 miles east of Santo Domingo, said navy Lt. Cmdr. Jose Torribio Gambero. Four
people were missing, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 40-foot boat was carrying migrants trying to illegally reach Puerto
Rico, a U.S. territory, when it sank in rough seas, the navy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dominican officials arrested two Dominicans accused of organizing the
smuggling trip, Torribio Gambero said. He identified them as William Ramirez
Ciprian and Bolivar Garcia.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Coast Guard sent two helicopters and two fixed-wing aircraft from
Puerto Rico on Tuesday to assist the search, said Coast Guard Petty Officer
Patrick Lopez.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of Dominicans die each year while trying to illegally reach Puerto
Rico, 75 miles to the east. From Puerto Rico, many try to make it to the U.S.
mainland.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Devise Debt Payment Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Speaker Dennis Hastert intends to announce on Wednesday
that House Republicans will develop a long-term economic plan in next several
weeks that envisions paying off the public debt by 2015, GOP aides said Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   These aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Illinois
Republican's pledge anticipates setting aside all of the projected Social
Security surplus as well as some portion of projected general government surplus
funds to eliminate the $3.7 trillion public debt for the first since since 1835,
when Andrew Jackson was president.
</P>
<P>
	   No precise details were available.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we eliminate this debt, that money can be freed up for use on other
priorities like tax relief, investing in our schools, or fortifying our national
defense,'' according to remarks prepared for delivery by the Illinois
Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert made his first public mention of retiring the national debt at a
news conference two weeks ago. His decision to expand on the issue several days
before Congress convenes underscores the extent to which Republicans are hoping
to lay out a legislative agenda to compete with President Clinton's State of the
Union address.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert is expected to call on Clinton to join Republicans in their debt
retirement effort when he addresses the issue in New Mexico on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said money would
still be available for tax cuts that majority Republicans want to enact this
year, including relief from the so-called marriage penalty. One aide said the
booming economy meant the GOP blueprint could also accommodate the $483 billion
multiyear tax cut that GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush advocates.
</P>
<P>
	   Beginning last spring, Republicans sought to position themselves as strong
defenders of Social Security, declaring that in a reversal of long-standing
practice, Congress wouldn't spend any of the retirement program's surplus on
general government needs.
</P>
<P>
	   Revised budget estimates expected to be made public next week will show that
Republicans met their goal for the current fiscal year. And under current law,
excess Social Security funds are used to pay down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   The speaker is expected to say he is directing the Budget Committee to begin
work on legislation to present to the GOP leadership before a budget is passed
in the House, and no later than April 15.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, he will touch indirectly on a second GOP election-year
initiative, a drive to reduce wasteful government spending, by saying that
cutting out waste is essential if the nation is to be public debt free in the
next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The total national debt now totals an estimated $5.76 trillion, of which
$3.7 trillion is owed the public in Treasury bills and savings bonds. The
remaining $2 trillion is owed by the government to Social Security and other
trust funds.

<HEADLINE> Furniture Refinisher Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 3,000 cans of furniture refinisher are being
recalled because the product and its vapors can seep or leak from the nozzle
base at the top of the can, posing a risk of fire and chemical injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   The recalled product, Formby's Conditioning Furniture Refinisher, is used to
refinish wood furniture, and is sold individually and as part of Formby's
``Introduction to Refinishing Kit.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Sherwin-Williams Co. of Cleveland and Brockway Standard of Atlanta
issued the recall after receiving one report of an employee suffering minor
burns when refinisher vapors ignited, the Consumer Product Safety Commission
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The 32-ounce metal cans read, ``Formby's Furniture Workshop'' and
``Furniture Refinisher'' in white lettering on a burgundy and mostly green
background. A depiction of Homer Formby appears on the face of the can.
</P>
<P>
	   The recalled products have the following lot codes written in black ink on
the bottom of the can: A961600, A961610, A961620, A961630, A967270 and A969330.
Cans with blue ink codes are not being recalled.
</P>
<P>
	   Discount department, hardware and hobby stores nationwide sold the
refinisher from October 1999 through January 2000. The individual cans sold for
about $13 and the kits sold for about $16.
</P>
<P>
	   The safety commission advises consumers to stop using the refinisher
immediately, and place the product in a well-ventilated area away from any
source of ignition, such as near a gas-fueled appliance. The container should
kept upright to avoid leaks and spills.

<HEADLINE> Affirmative Action Repeal Protested  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID MARK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Two black legislators staged a sit-in Tuesday to
protest Gov. Jeb Bush's executive order repealing affirmative action programs
for state contracts and university admissions.
</P>
<P>
	   The sit-in at the lieutenant governor's office began with three lawmakers,
all Democrats. They had met with Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan, a key player in the
November repeal decision, at about 3:30 p.m. and then refused to leave after he
told them the Republican governor would not change his mind. They remained there
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not going to waver, of course, not,'' Bush said during a brief news
conference. ``We're doing the people's work and I'm not going to let anybody,
for any reason stop us from doing that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Daryl Jones of Miami left about 5:30 p.m. to inform the Black Caucus of
what was happening, but he was not allowed to return to Brogan's office. That
left Sen. Kendrick Meek of Miami and Rep. Tony Hill of Jacksonville holding
forth into the night with eight reporters who also decided to spend the night.
</P>
<P>
	   Meek said they would stay ``as long as it takes.''
</P>
<P>
	   The lawmakers said they decided to sit in because the Board of Regents,
which oversees the State University System, is scheduled Friday to approve
replacing affirmative action with Bush's One Florida program for admissions and
because Monday was Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Carol Licko, the governor's general counsel, said the lawmakers could be
considered trespassing but that there would be no arrests.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush contends the One Florida program would increase minority enrollment in
the universities because it would grant admission to the top 20 percent of
students in each of the state's high schools.

<HEADLINE> Bradley targeting 17-year-olds in hunt for votes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) - One trick to building a campaign crowd: Pack the
school auditorium with a captive audience of students.
<P>
	   It's a sleight of hand that Bill Bradley could be accused of - with a
pattern of thin crowds and schools filling his schedule these days - if not for
the fact that 17- and 18-year-olds are actually part of his strategy for next
Monday's Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can still make this happen," Bradley told students Tuesday at West High
School. "If you support me, I'll love you. If you don't support me, I'll still
love you. But if you did support me, I'd love you a little bit more."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore, leading in all the Iowa polls, pledged
that he would never let up and would be an "active, energetic fighting
president" if Democrats give him the nomination and he is elected.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to fight my heart out for you," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spoke to about 200 backers at a college in Indianola before heading to
Knoxville to collect the endorsement of the American Federation of Government
Employees, the latest in his long list of union and other institutional support.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president was trying to energize his backers with a series of
rallies Tuesday, seeking to make sure that those backing him will show up at the
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has carved out sharp differences with Bradley over health care and
other issues and was repeating those differences in his rallies. His main theme,
however, was telling activists he'll bring energy to the campaign, contrasting
that with Bradley's more cerebral style.
</P>
<P>
	   Both men headed for New Hampshire later Tuesday and are to campaign there on
Wednesday before returning to Iowa to focus on the caucuses until the voting.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is to receive his first endorsement from a governor on Wednesday -
Oregon's John Kitzhaber.
</P>
<P>
	   While Gore has drawn sizable crowds of party activists to his recent
campaign stops, Bradley has invested a lot of time speaking to children at
closed-to-the-public events, from Exira Elementary to Atlantic High to a youth
forum on Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   It baffled Exira science and math teacher Marlene Ballou that only faculty
and students were allowed in to the elementary school gym for Bradley's
appearance in that tiny hamlet last week. "People wanted to come," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   All part of a plan, insisted Pete D'Alasandro, Bradley's Iowa political
director, for Bradley to finish with better than the 31 percent that
Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy took against President Carter in the 1980 Iowa
caucus.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you're going to break through that Kennedy barrier, you've got to turn
to new voters," D'Alasandro said.
</P>
<P>
	   Young people can participate in Monday's precinct caucuses as long as
they'll have their 18th birthday in time for the November election. A campaign
aide planned to visit each of West's government classes on Wednesday to seal
commitments.
</P>
<P>
	   But relying on this pool is a dubious strategy, said Elise Schuster, 18, who
is trying to rally her West classmates to Bradley's side before Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "High school students are lazy. They don't want to have to go out of their
way for something they don't think will make a difference in the long run," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Amber Massa, 17, said she will also caucus for Bradley but added, "I'll
probably go by myself. I don't think my parents are that into it and kids don't
really talk about it that much in the halls."
</P>
<P>
	   In the corridor after Bradley's speech, one caucus organizer with a
clipboard said he had signed up three parents.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Gore, with the backing of the Democratic Party establishment, has a
lock on Iowa's traditional caucus goers and a double-digit lead in statewide
polls, the Bradley campaign is trying to make students and other Iowans - sports
fans, for instance, who remember Bradley's basketball career with the New York
Knicks - into first-time caucus participants.
</P>
<P>
	   To try and demystify the arcane caucus process, the campaign set up a new
Web site where first-timers can log on, identify which precinct they live in,
even watch a video of a mock caucus staged by the Bradley team.
</P>
<P>
	   Anne Greenleaf, a West senior and Bradley campaign volunteer, told her peers
they should caucus with her for Bradley because they'll need a health care plan
like the one he has proposed.
</P>
<P>
	   "As seniors we're going to be going out on our own and affordable health
insurance is an issue. We need affordable insurance for everyone - not 57
percent or 77 percent, but everyone," the girl said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley won hearty applause from West students when he talked of closing
corporate tax loopholes, standing up to the National Rifle Association and
removing the Confederate flag from atop the South Carolina Statehouse.

</P>
<P>
	   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Timothy ``Little Rock'' Reed, who crusaded in Ohio
for American Indian prisoners, died Saturday from injuries he suffered in a car
accident. He was 39.
</P>
<P>
	   Reed said Ohio authorities wanted to silence him for speaking out against
alleged abuses of Indian prisoners, fought for five years to prevent being
extradited from New Mexico to Ohio. He eventually lost the battle in the U.S.
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   He had served a decade in prison in Ohio for armed robberies and drug theft.
While in prison, Reed transformed himself into a jailhouse legal expert.
</P>
<P>
	   Six weeks before his yearlong parole would have ended in 1993, he fled to
New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   He was picked up in Taos in 1994. But a state district judge ruled he fled
Ohio ``under duress and under a reasonable fear for his safety and life,'' and
released him. The state Supreme Court agreed in 1997. Then-Chief Justice Gene
Franchini wrote that Reed was not a fugitive from justice but a ``refugee from
injustice.''
</P>
<P>
	   That ruling was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, and Reed was returned
to Ohio. He was released in December 1998.

<P>
	   EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. (AP) -- David Rogerson Williams Jr., one of the founders
of the Tulsa, Okla.-based Williams Cos., died Saturday. He was 78.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Schindler Widow's Pension Restored  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- The government on Tuesday restored the
pension for the widow of the German industrialist featured in the film
``Schindler's List.''
</P>
<P>
	   Emilie Schindler will receive $900 a month to help ease her economic plight,
said Interior Minister Federico Storani. A change of government in December had
disrupted the payment, ordered last year by former President Carlos Menem.
</P>
<P>
	   German industrialist Oskar Schindler is credited with saving nearly 1,300
Polish Jews from Nazi concentration camps by drawing up lists of fictitious jobs
to convince German authorities they were essential to the war effort.
</P>
<P>
	   The story was the basis for Steven Spielberg's 1993 Oscar-winning film,
``Schindler's List.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Schindlers moved to Argentina in 1949, and Schindler says that eight
years later he returned to Germany, leaving her penniless. She said she has seen
little financial benefit from the success of the film.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the attention the movie brought to her husband, Schindler rarely
concealed her disdain for her husband and has accused him of being adulterous.
</P>
<P>
	   Schindler died in 1974 and at his own request, he was buried in Israel.

<HEADLINE> Ted Williams Goes to Bat for Bush  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- First the father, now the son.
</P>
<P>
	   Baseball great Ted Williams on Tuesday endorsed George W. Bush for
president.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams is a Republican loyalist and close friend of Bush's father, former
President Bush, who won the former Boston Red Sox outfielder's endorsement in
1992.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I spent a few minutes with him earlier in the evening and I'm really
impressed every time I hear him speak,'' the Hall of Famer said of George W.
during a brief appearance at the annual New Hampshire Baseball Dinner at the
Center of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   In his keynote speech to an overflow crowd of more than 800, Bush said: ``In
our household his (Williams') name is as revered as it is here in Boston and New
Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before the dinner, Bush attended an autograph session with former relief
pitcher and Cy Young winner Dennis Eckersley, former Red Sox players Mike Easler
and Rico Petrocelli, and a number of New Hampshirites who have gone onto the big
leagues.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush never played professional baseball, he was managing general
partner of the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush scribbled his signature across a ``Bush'' baseball card that featured a
portrait of him and a banner reading, ``GOP's Best Hope for 2000.'' Under
``position,'' the card read, ``governor of the 2nd largest state.''
</P>
<P>
	   On the back, where real baseball cards usually give a player's game and
vital statistics, was a summary of Bush's record as Texas governor, as well as a
list of some of his political priorities.

<HEADLINE> Indian Protesters Reach Quito  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Slipping by military highway patrols, thousands of
highland Indians, including women and children in ragged clothing, reached Quito
Tuesday as the vanguard of an Indian protest to demand the resignation of
embattled President Jamil Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
	   The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador, which represents
the country's 4 million Indians, has organized what it calls an ``indigenous
uprising,'' which includes blockading highways and a march on Quito by at least
10,000 Indians.
</P>
<P>
	   After sleeping and resting most of the day at a park near the downtown, some
5,000 Indians marched peacefully toward Congress, located two blocks away, but
were turned back by police barricades.
</P>
<P>
	   They continued their march along nearby streets, chanting anti-Mahuad
slogans in Spanish and the Quichua Indian language, before returning to the
park. The march stretched six blocks long and caused traffic jams during the
evening rush hour.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have come to found a new Ecuador conceived from an indigenous
viewpoint,'' said Antonio Vargas, president of the Indian confederation.
</P>
<P>
	   Two Indian healers dressed in traditional clothing and sandals burned leaves
and herbs to mark ``the beginning of a new era.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indian leaders have set Wednesday as the day of the symbolic ``capture'' of
Quito, Ecuador's capital, by thousands of Indian protesters. Leaders at one
point had said 40,000 Indians would take part but have since scaled back the
figure to 10,000.
</P>
<P>
	   They are demanding Mahuad's resignation, accusing him of failing to end
Ecuador's economic crisis, including a 60 percent inflation rate, the highest in
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indians also say Mahuad should go because of his plan to make the U.S.
dollar Ecuador's official currency in a bid to halt inflation and stabilize the
economy. Their leaders charge the step will impoverish even further the 7
million poor people in Ecuador's population of 12 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The government deployed 35,000 soldiers and police to patrol the country's
major highways to block Indians who live in isolated highland villages from
reaching Quito.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the patrols by security forces, hundreds of Indians appeared at dawn
Tuesday in Quito, located 9,400 feet high in the Andes, and began gathering at a
large park near downtown. Throughout the day they continued to filter into the
park in small groups.
</P>
<P>
	   An Indian leader, who refused to give his name, said the Indians from his
village had walked all night through the mountains, avoiding highways.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have come to Quito to stay until Jamil goes back to his home,'' the
leader said.
</P>
<P>
	   Indians from other mountain villages said they had arrived on buses and had
managed to get by military blockades by telling soldiers they were on their way
to towns near the capital to attend religious festivals and other events.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indians who gathered in El Arbolito park, 20 blocks from the government
palace, included men, women and children in tattered clothing and ponchos.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday groups of Indians blocked highways in eight of Ecuador's 22
provinces, the latest in a series of anti-Mahuad protests. Security forces
quickly cleared the roads without violence.
</P>
<P>
	   The government on Jan. 5 declared a state of emergency, empowering the armed
forces to control the growing public protests.

<HEADLINE> Corzine says health care 'a basic right'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) - Democrat Jon S. Corzine said Tuesday that
America's health care system threatens to become "a tale of two cities, where
health depends on wealth."
<P>
	   "Health care is a basic right," said Corzine, former chairman of the Wall
Street investment firm Goldman Sachs, "and neither the government nor the
private sector is doing enough to secure that right for everyone."
</P>
<P>
	   His Democratic opponent, former Gov. Jim Florio, said last month in a speech
of his own that health care must be viewed as a right rather than a privilege.
</P>
<P>
	   Both candidates say health care will be a major plank in their campaigns for
the U.S. Senate. The Democratic primary is June 6.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, Corzine said he would
support expanding Medicare coverage to cover prescription drugs so that bills
from the drug store "won't eat up a senior's entire Social Security check."
</P>
<P>
	   He called for government subsidies to small businesses, the self-employed
and the unemployed to help them pay for insurance. He added that Americans who
could not get insurance any other way should be able to join the plan that
covers U.S. senators and their families.
</P>
<P>
	   He said birth control pills should be covered as "basic medicine, not (as)
an extra to be covered at personal expense." And he called for a refundable
$1,000 tax credit for seniors or families taking care of an aging parent.
</P>
<P>
	   Florio, in his speech last month, outlined his idea of a patients' bill of
rights.
</P>
<P>
	   It includes the right to choose a doctor, to have access to specialists, to
appeal when a health care plan denies care, and to be compensated if harmed by
the negligence of a managed care company.

<HEADLINE> $25,000 Proposed for Every Alaskan  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL QUEARY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- A legislative leader wants to solve Alaska's budget
problems by giving every resident a $25,000 check and then abolishing the
dividends the state's oil-royalty savings account has paid for nearly two
decades.
</P>
<P>
	   While Alaskans pay no income tax and no state sales tax, the oil revenue
that once paid for most state government has declined, leaving a budget gap that
must be filled from a dwindling cash reserve. This gap is projected to grow to
at least $800 million in the coming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Alaska Permanent Fund has grown to $27 billion in the booming
stock market, and paid a record $1,770 dividend to more than a half-million
people last year. The checks went in the mail a few weeks after nearly 84
percent of the electorate rejected a plan to reduce the dividend and use part of
the fund's earnings to balance the budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The radical proposal from the Senate majority leader, Jerry Mackie, would
use about half of the fund to pay the $25,000 mega-dividend in 2001 to people
who established residency in the state before Jan. 1., 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The existing dividend program would be abolished, and the earnings from the
remaining fund would be dedicated to inflation-proofing and balancing the state
budget.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is probably the only way in my mind that the people are going to
accept any use of the fund,'' said Mackie, a Republican. ``It has to be a large
enough amount of money to earn the support of the people.''
</P>
<P>
	   The plan requires an amendment to the state constitution, which means it
needs to win over two-thirds of both houses of the Legislature and Alaska voters
in November.
</P>
<P>
	   It's unclear so far how much support Mackie will find in the
Republican-controlled Legislature. Many described the proposal as an intriguing
addition to the debate over how to balance the budget.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Definitely a conversation-starter,'' said Sen. Sean Parnell, R-Anchorage,
the co-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Some condemned the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Buying off the people to destroy the Permanent Fund?'' scoffed Republican
Sen. Rick Halford, an ardent defender of the fund and its dividend. ``I think
the people are smarter than that.''

	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 132.04 points, or 0.69

<HEADLINE> Brazil Defense Minister Resigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's defense minister resigned Tuesday after
days of speculation that he had links with organized crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Elcio Alvares declined to give any specific reason for resigning.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to make clear that the same way I entered the ministry is the way
I'll leave the ministry, with complete support of the president,'' Alvares said
after meeting with President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
	   Geraldo Quintao, the country's solicitor general, was named late Tuesday to
replace Alvares, said presidential spokesman Georges Lamaziere.
</P>
<P>
	   Alvares, a former senator with the conservative Liberal Front Party, became
the first civilian head of the armed forces when the defense ministry was
created in June 1999 with the combination of the air force, navy and army
ministries.
</P>
<P>
	   But questions about Alvares' past began to haunt him in October, when the
leading news magazine Isto E published charges that he headed an organized crime
ring while governor of Espirito Santo, a state just north of Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
	   The charges resurfaced in December after a congressional drug trafficking
probe pointed to links between organized crime and one of Alvares' key aides,
Solange Rezende.
</P>
<P>
	   Alvares was forced to fire Rezende, a longtime associate, along with air
force Gen. Walter Brauer.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Judge KOs Casino Compacts  </HEADLINE>
   By DEE-ANN DURBIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- The Legislature violated Michigan's Constitution when
it approved four tribal casino compacts by a 1998 resolution, a judge ruled
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Ingham County Judge Peter Houk ruled in a lawsuit filed by Democratic state
Rep. Laura Baird and Taxpayers of Michigan Against Casinos.
</P>
<P>
	   The state said it will appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   The four compacts took effect in February, and only one casino is operating.
</P>
<P>
	   Engler negotiated and signed the compacts in 1997. The Legislature approved
them during a late-night session through a resolution, which requires only a
majority of lawmakers present.
</P>
<P>
	   Baird and former Attorney General Frank Kelley argued that the state
Constitution required a majority of the Legislature to approve the compacts as
new state law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My total interest in this has nothing to do with gambling. My interest is
to protect the powers of the Legislature,'' Baird said.
</P>
<P>
	   Engler spokesman John Truscott said the decision could nullify not only the
four compacts in the lawsuit, but also compacts with seven other tribes that
were passed by resolution in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is very clear that this judge does not understand federal law or tribal
law,'' Truscott said. ``We have never lost a case when it comes to the
governor's authority, and we don't intend to lose this one.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Fulkerson, an attorney for the anti-casino group, said he's unsure if
the decision immediately voids the four compacts, but said he planned to discuss
the next steps in the case Wednesday with the state attorney general's office
and the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs.

<HEADLINE> Inaccurate Testimony Used Vs. CIA  </HEADLINE>
   By C. BRYSON HULL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOUSTON (AP) -- The Justice Department acknowledged in a court filing made
public Tuesday that the lead prosecutor in the 1983 arms-dealing case against
former CIA officer Edwin P. Wilson introduced inaccurate testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   The revelation comes in the government's response to Wilson's appeal of his
conviction for shipping 20 tons of C-4 plastic explosives from Houston's
Intercontinental Airport to Libya. Wilson is serving 52 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson, who had retired from the CIA, said the agency had authorized him to
ingratiate himself with the Libyan government for intelligence-gathering
purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   The testimony in question concerns an affidavit in court records from CIA
executive director Charles Briggs, then the No. 3 agency official. The affidavit
said ``Wilson was not asked or requested, directly or indirectly, to perform or
provide any services, directly or indirectly, for CIA,'' after his 1971
retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   That affidavit was reread to jurors at their request; an hour later, they
returned a guilty verdict.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson's appeal included dozens of once-classified documents showing CIA
lawyers argued with prosecutors against using the affidavit as then written.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the documents, Wilson had 80 contacts with the CIA from his
retirement through 1978 and provided a variety of services at the government's
request, including arranging gun sales to a Saudi Arabian security agency and
the shipment of two desalinization units to Egypt on behalf of the CIA.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department's response doesn't challenge the accuracy of the
documents in Wilson's appeal. In fact, the agency included similar memos
outlining an eight-month discussion between the CIA and Justice Department over
what to do about Briggs' affidavit.
</P>
<P>
	   One such memo recounts a discussion between Stanley Sporkin, then the CIA's
top lawyer, and Theodore Greenberg, the lead Wilson prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
	   Sporkin told Greenberg ``it was a bad idea to use the declaration. Mr.
Greenberg responded that the use of the declaration was vital to his case and he
intended to use it,'' according to a memo in the government's filing.
</P>
<P>
	   Another memo shows that Sporkin argued that ``at minimum, the word
`indirectly' should be removed.''
</P>
<P>
	   After the conversation, Greenberg introduced the testimony in court.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department's response says ``the objective inaccuracy of a
statement proffered by a government witness or otherwise introduced by the
government does not, itself, provide the defendant a basis'' for the conviction
to be overturned. The prosecutors also said the ``inaccurate'' information was
corrected during another appeal by Wilson.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutors claim Wilson failed to offer any evidence he was
specifically authorized to conduct the Libya deal. ``A mere belief that he was
acting in the interests of the United States did not constitute a legitimate
defense,'' the motion reads.
</P>
<P>
	   David Adler, a lawyer for Wilson and himself a former CIA officer, said he
was not surprised false evidence was introduced. ``What is surprising is how
well the Justice Department and the CIA documented their efforts to conceal the
lie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether Wilson benefits from that extensive documentation -- 800 pages of
which were made public -- remains to be seen. U.S. District Judge Lynn N. Hughes
must decide whether Wilson deserves a new trial.

<HEADLINE> Police:Colombia Rightists Execute 7  </HEADLINE>
   By JARED KOTLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Suspected rightist militias dragged seven unarmed
villagers from their homes and executed them in the town plaza Tuesday, police
said, as political violence surged in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
	   The rampage followed bombings of electrical towers and bloody weekend
clashes between guerrillas and government troops. The fresh fighting had been
expected following the expiration last week of a temporary, year-end truce.
</P>
<P>
	   In another attack Tuesday, two hand grenades thrown at a small police post
in the capital, Bogota, killed a girl and wounded five people at an adjacent
school, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   In yet another episode, about 100 armed men wearing the armbands of
Colombia's national paramilitary organization burst into three adjoining
villages in Antioquia State and began shooting people, witnesses said. Soldiers
and police were headed to the villages late Tuesday to try to confirm the
reports.
</P>
<P>
	   In a village near the town of Becerril in Cesar state, about 350 miles north
of Bogota, gunmen lined the seven men up and shot them to death, state police
said. The gunmen arrived with a list of names -- a trademark of rightist
paramilitary groups, who've killed thousands of people they accuse of
collaborating with leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence coincided with a visit to a rebel stronghold Tuesday by a U.N.
envoy, who nonetheless expressed optimism in the country's fledging peace
process.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, bombs planted by suspected rebels damaged or toppled 22
electrical towers, mostly in Antioquia state, cutting off power and forcing many
schools to close.
</P>
<P>
	   The state capital, Medellin, was under severe electricity rationing Tuesday,
and more than 650,000 students were unable to go to school, officials said. In
neighboring Choco State, 14 towns were without any power.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials suspect the bombings were carried out by the Leftist National
Liberation Army, or ELN, which routinely sabotages oil pipelines and electrical
towers.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the ELN and the paramilitary groups have complained about being
excluded from peace negotiations begun a year ago between President Andres
Pastrana and Colombia's largest rebel band, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
	   Those talks are moving slowly amid ongoing fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   FARC attacks over the weekend killed 75 rebels, twelve soldiers and police,
and eight civilians, the army reported. They were the bloodiest clashes since a
20-day truce expired on Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the latest violence, U.N. envoy Jan Egeland of Norway said Tuesday
he sees ample ``political will'' to make peace in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
	   Accompanied by presidential peace commissioner Victor G. Ricardo, Egeland
made the statement after meeting with Manuel Marulanda, the founder and
legendary chief of the FARC.
</P>
<P>
	   The rendezvous occurred in a massive southern region where Pastrana has
evacuated his troops to facilitate peace talks with the 15,000-member rebel
group.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Dolphin Rescue Conducted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE TORCH KEY, Fla. (AP) -- Marine biologists conducted a second rescue
operation to push a group of stranded dolphins into deeper waters off one of the
Florida Keys Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Marine Fisheries Service and the Coast Guard lured nine
dolphins with bait and escorted them to deeper waters off Little Torch Key,
Florida Marine Patrol Officer David Dipre said.
</P>
<P>
	   The stranded dolphins were pushed out to sea with human help in the first
rescue attempt Monday, but some returned to shallow waters by Tuesday morning,
said fisheries service spokeswoman Blair Mase.
</P>
<P>
	   Three more bottle-nosed dolphins died in the latest stranding, bringing to
28 the number of dolphins that have died since the mammals started getting stuck
in tidal flats Sunday night, Mase said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's very hard for these animals, once they're in shore, to navigate
themselves off shore,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, rescuers formed a quarter-mile-long human chain to help push
about 20 stranded dolphins back out to sea. The dolphins cleared the shore, but
nine returned to shallow waters off Little Torch Key Tuesday, about 25 miles
south of the original stranding off Long Key.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: Interceptor Missed Target  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an apparent setback on the Pentagon's drive to develop
a national missile defense, a prototype missile interceptor streaked into space
Tuesday night in search of a mock warhead launched from an Air Force base in
California but failed to hit the target, a Pentagon official announced.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An intercept was not achieved for reasons unknown at this time,''
spokesman Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Lehner said.
</P>
<P>
	   The mock warhead was meant to simulate a nuclear attack on the United
States, and a successful intercept would have provided a dramatic boost to the
Pentagon's effort to show missile defense can work.

<HEADLINE> $25,000 Proposed for Every Alaskan  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL QUEARY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- A legislative leader wants to give each state
resident a last check for $25,000 from the state's oil-royalty savings account,
then dedicate the fund to balancing the state budget instead of paying the
smaller, annual dividends that Alaskans have received for nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
	   While Alaskans pay no income tax and no state sales tax, the oil revenue
that once paid for most state government has declined, leaving a budget gap that
must be filled from a dwindling cash reserve. This gap is projected to grow to
at least $800 million in the coming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Alaska Permanent Fund has grown to $27 billion in the booming
stock market, and paid a record $1,770 dividend to more than a half-million
people last year. The checks went in the mail a few weeks after nearly 84
percent of the electorate rejected a plan to reduce the dividend and use part of
the fund's earnings to balance the budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal to fix the state's unique financial situation from Senate
Majority Leader Jerry Mackie would use about half of the fund to pay the $25,000
mega-dividend in 2001 to people who established residency in the state before
Jan. 1., 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The existing dividend program would be abolished, and the earnings from the
remaining fund would be dedicated to inflation-proofing and balancing the state
budget.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is probably the only way in my mind that the people are going to
accept any use of the fund,'' said Mackie, a Republican. ``It has to be a large
enough amount of money to earn the support of the people.''
</P>
<P>
	   The plan requires an amendment to the state constitution, which means it
needs to win over two-thirds of both houses of the Legislature and Alaska voters
in November.
</P>
<P>
	   It's unclear so far how much support Mackie will find in the
Republican-controlled Legislature. Many described the proposal as an intriguing
addition to the debate over how to balance the budget.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Definitely a conversation-starter,'' said Sen. Sean Parnell, R-Anchorage,
the co-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Some condemned the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Buying off the people to destroy the Permanent Fund?'' scoffed Republican
Sen. Rick Halford, an ardent defender of the fund and its dividend. ``I think
the people are smarter than that.''

Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, about 20 minutes after the target
missile lifted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base at 9:19 p.m. EST and headed
over the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   Lehner said Pentagon officials would conduct an extensive review of the test
data to determine why the interceptor missed the target. He said the first
preliminary report would not be available for at least 48 hours.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Targeting Teens for Votes  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- One trick to building a campaign crowd: Pack the
school auditorium with a captive audience of students.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a sleight of hand that Bill Bradley could be accused of -- with a
pattern of thin crowds and schools filling his schedule these days -- if not for
the fact that 17- and 18-year-olds are actually part of his strategy for next
Monday's Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can still make this happen,'' Bradley told students Tuesday at West
High School. ``If you support me, I'll love you. If you don't support me, I'll
still love you. But if you did support me, I'd love you a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore, leading in all the Iowa polls, pledged
that he would never let up and would be an ``active, energetic fighting
president'' if Democrats give him the nomination and he is elected.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to fight my heart out for you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spoke to about 200 backers at a college in Indianola before heading to
Knoxville to collect the endorsement of the American Federation of Government
Employees, the latest in his long list of union and other institutional support.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is to receive his first endorsement from a governor on Wednesday --
Oregon's John Kitzhaber. Bradley also picked up support Tuesday from the 3,000
state social workers in the United Electrical Radio Machine Workers of America
who were swayed by Bradley's commitment to eliminating child poverty, union
president Dan Kelley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, meanwhile, was picking up another gubernatorial endorsement on
Wednesday, from Vermont Gov. Howard Dean.
</P>
<P>
	   Both candidates later flew to New Hampshire and were returning to Iowa
Thursday to focus on the caucuses until the voting.
</P>
<P>
	   While Gore has drawn sizable crowds of party activists to his recent
campaign stops, Bradley has invested a lot of time speaking to children at
closed-to-the-public events, from Exira Elementary to Atlantic High to a youth
forum on Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   It baffled Exira science and math teacher Marlene Ballou that only faculty
and students were allowed in to the elementary school gym for Bradley's
appearance in that tiny hamlet last week. ``People wanted to come,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   All part of a plan, insisted Pete D'Alasandro, Bradley's Iowa political
director, for Bradley to finish with better than the 31 percent that
Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy took against President Carter in the 1980 Iowa
caucus.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you're going to break through that Kennedy barrier, you've got to turn
to new voters,'' D'Alasandro said.
</P>
<P>
	   Young people can participate in Monday's precinct caucuses as long as
they'll have their 18th birthday in time for the November election. A campaign
aide planned to visit each of West's government classes on Wednesday to seal
commitments.
</P>
<P>
	   But relying on this pool is a dubious strategy, said Elise Schuster, 18, who
is trying to rally her West classmates to Bradley's side before Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``High school students are lazy. They don't want to have to go out of their
way for something they don't think will make a difference in the long run,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Amber Massa, 17, said she will also caucus for Bradley but added, ``I'll
probably go by myself. I don't think my parents are that into it and kids don't
really talk about it that much in the halls.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the corridor after Bradley's speech, one caucus organizer with a
clipboard said he had signed up three parents.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Gore, with the backing of the Democratic Party establishment, has a
lock on Iowa's traditional caucus goers and a double-digit lead in statewide
polls, the Bradley campaign is trying to turn students and other Iowans --
sports fans, for instance, who remember Bradley's basketball career with the New
York Knicks -- into first-time caucus participants.
</P>
<P>
	   To try and demystify the arcane caucus process, the campaign set up a new
Web site where first-timers can log on, identify which precinct they live in,
even watch a video of a mock caucus staged by the Bradley team.
</P>
<P>
	   Anne Greenleaf, a West senior and Bradley campaign volunteer, told her peers
they should caucus with her for Bradley because they'll need a health care plan
like the one he has proposed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As seniors we're going to be going out on our own and affordable health
insurance is an issue. We need affordable insurance for everyone -- not 57
percent or 77 percent, but everyone,'' the girl said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley won hearty applause from West students when he talked of closing
corporate tax loopholes, standing up to the National Rifle Association and
removing the Confederate flag from atop the South Carolina Statehouse.

Missile Interceptor Misses Target
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an apparent setback on the Pentagon's drive to develop
a national missile defense, a prototype missile interceptor streaked into space
tonight in search of a mock warhead launched from an Air Force base in
California but failed to hit the target, a Pentagon official announced. "An
intercept was not achieved for reasons unknown at this time," spokesman Air
Force Lt. Col. Rick Lehner said. The mock warhead was meant to simulate a
nuclear attack on the United States. The interceptor rocket was launched from a
U.S. Army missile range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands at 9:19 p.m.
EST and headed over the Pacific Ocean.

Affirmative Action Repeal Protested
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Two black legislators staged a sit-in today to
protest Gov. Jeb Bush's executive order repealing affirmative action programs
for state contracts and university admissions. After meeting with Lt. Gov. Frank
Brogan, a key player in the November repeal decision, Sen. Kendrick Meek of
Miami and Rep. Tony Hill of Jacksonville -- both democrats -- refused to leave
after he told them the Republican governor would not change his mind. The two
held forth into the night with eight reporters who also decided to spend the
night. Meek said they would stay "as long as it takes."

House GOP Devises Debt Payment Plan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Speaker Dennis Hastert intends to announce tomorrow that
House Republicans will develop a long-term economic plan in the next several
weeks that envisions paying off the public debt by 2015, GOP aides said tonight.
These aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Illinois Republican's
pledge anticipates setting aside all of the projected Social Security surplus as
well as some portion of projected general government surplus funds to eliminate
the $3.7 trillion public debt for the first since since 1835, when Andrew
Jackson was president.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Thousands of highland Indian protesters, including
women and children in ragged clothing, slipped by military patrols and reached
the capital today to demand the resignation of the country's embattled
president. The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador, which
represents the country's 4 million Indians, is demanding Jamil Mahuad's
resignation, accusing him of failing to end Ecuador's economic crisis, including
a 60 percent inflation rate, the highest in Latin America.

First Lady To Stay With Clinton
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton vowed today to "spend the rest
of my life" with President Clinton, whose relationship with a White House intern
led to his impeachment and a failed Senate vote last year to remove him from
office. Mrs. Clinton made the comments during an interview with Buffalo's
WKBW-TV. Since the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky became public, Mrs.
Clinton has faced questions about the state of her marriage. She usually brushes
them aside, although she has said in the past that they are a couple who still
love each other.

Microsoft Disagrees With Judge
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. told a federal judge today it
"respectfully disagrees" with his ruling that the company is an abusive
monopoly, arguing that it doesn't control the price or availability of software
to run the world's personal computers. Microsoft's lawyers repeated earlier
assertions that the judge inappropriately considered as the company's only
competition other software that runs Intel-compatible PCs. Meanwhile, Microsoft
announced today that its second-quarter profits soared 22 percent to $2.44
billion, on $6.11 billion in revenues for the period ending Dec. 31. Its stock
climbed more than $3 to close above $115.

Seton Hall Beats No. 19 St. John's 78-70
</SUBHEAD>

	   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Seton Hall had plenty from the outside -- 10
3-pointers as the Pirates snapped No. 19 St. John's six-game winning streak
78-70 tonight. Seton Hall (12-3, 4-1 Big East) has won nine of 10 games but none
was as big as this one over a team that had just moved into the Top 25 after
beating then-No. 5 Connecticut on the road Sunday. The zone defense that gave
Connecticut so much trouble over the weekend didn't bother the Pirates as they
went 10-for-21 from 3-point range with Rimas Kaukenas going 4-for-7 and Darius
Lane 3-for-9.

<HEADLINE> Missile Interceptor Misses Target  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an apparent setback on the Pentagon's drive to develop
a national missile defense, a prototype missile interceptor streaked into space
Tuesday night in search of a mock warhead launched from an Air Force base in
California but failed to hit the target, a Pentagon official announced.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An intercept was not achieved for reasons unknown at this time,''
spokesman Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Lehner said.
</P>
<P>
	   The mock warhead was meant to simulate a nuclear attack on the United
States, and a successful intercept would have provided a dramatic boost to the
Pentagon's effort to show missile defense can work.
</P>
<P>
	   The interceptor rocket was launched from a U.S. Army missile range on
Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, about 20 minutes after the target
missile lifted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base at 9:19 p.m. EST and headed
over the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   Lehner said Pentagon officials would conduct an extensive review of the test
data to determine why the interceptor missed the target. He said the first
preliminary report would not be available for at least 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
	   The interceptor launch went off as planned, Lehner said. ``What happened
after it got into space we do not know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon officials had asserted before the test that even if the interceptor
failed to hit its target, there were other important goals for the test,
including the first test of a computerized battle management system that is
designed to communicate with the interceptor as it soars into space.
</P>
<P>
	   Lehner said there was no immediate word on whether these other aspects of
the test worked as planned.
</P>
<P>
	   In remarks to reporters several hours before the test, Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon said that if the interceptor, called a ``kill vehicle,'' succeeded
in hitting the target warhead -- and if all of the radar, communications and
other technical aspects of the test worked correctly -- then the Pentagon would
have met its self-defined minimum standard for recommending that the system is
feasible to deploy.
</P>
<P>
	   An initial test last October resulted in a successful intercept.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we just have to wait until all the results are in and see how they
mesh together before we can say it's a successful integrated systems test,''
Bacon told reporters before the scheduled start of the test.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a dozen protesters held a vigil outside Vandenberg Air Force Base
on Tuesday to protest the test. ``We were all holding up signs protesting this
wrongheaded thing our government is doing,'' said Bud Boothe, 74, a member of
the Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in Space.
</P>
<P>
	   Nuclear powers Russia and China are the most vocal opponents of a proposed
U.S. national missile defense, but it is North Korea -- economically destitute,
politically isolated and militarily hostile -- that Clinton administration
officials say poses the most immediate missile threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Thus the initial version of a national missile defense, as envisioned by
Pentagon planners, would be designed mainly to counter a small-scale attack from
North Korea. More robust defenses might be added later to shield American
territory from missile attacks by other so-called rogue nations, like Iraq or
Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton may decide as early as this summer whether to go ahead
with a national missile defense, which the Pentagon estimates will cost at least
$12.7 billion over the next five years. It could be ready for use by 2005,
although many officials involved in the program believe that may be too
ambitious.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia is concerned that a U.S. missile defense system would undermine the
deterrent value of its nuclear missile arsenal, as is China.
</P>
<P>
	   John Hamre, the deputy U.S. defense secretary, said Tuesday that Russia and
China need not worry about the U.S. system, which would be designed to counter
limited missile attacks from ``rogue'' countries like North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview in his Pentagon office, Hamre said North Korea is a
legitimate source of worry about a surprise missile attack, since it has taken
the apparently irrational course of investing heavily in developing a long-range
missile capability even though no one is threatening it and even while many of
its people are starving.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no rational reason why North Korea, with the economic straits
that they are in, would choose such a provocative thing to do,'' Hamre said.
``This is a country that doesn't care about the opinion of the international
community,'' and therefore must be judged capable of attacking the United States
unprovoked.

<HEADLINE> Rockets 90, Trail Blazers 89  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL A. LUTZ AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOUSTON (AP) -- Steve Francis scored 26 points, including six in the final
3:37, as the Houston Rockets held off the Portland Trail Blazers 90-89 Tuesday
night for their season high fourth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Rockets trailing 84-82, Francis hit two free throws with 3:37 to
play and he added a layup with 2:19 to go that put the Rockets ahead for good. A
17-foot jumper by Francis and two free throws by Anthony Miller increased the
lead to 90-84 with 1:23 left.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Trail Blazers weren't finished. Rasheed Wallace completed a
three-point play with 1:05 to play and Scottie Pippen added a layup with 34
seconds to play to cut Houston's lead to one.
</P>
<P>
	   Portland got two chances to win, but Pippen missed a driving layup with 5.7
seconds to play and Greg Anthony's final shot bounced off the rim.
</P>
<P>
	   Francis had 12 assists for the second consecutive game and the Rockets also
got help from rookie Kenny Thomas, who scored 15 of his career-high 22 points in
the second half and got 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Smith led the Trail Blazers with 21 points and Wallace finished with
17.
</P>
<P>
	   Francis got hot in the third quarter, leading a 15-4 Houston run that gave
the Rockets a 67-64 lead with 2:39 left in the third quarter. Francis had eight
points in the run and the Rockets led 73-71 after three.
</P>
<P>
	   Hakeem Olajuwon played before the home crowd for the first time after
missing 20 games recovering from hernia surgery and drew loud applause when he
entered with game with 2:59 left in the first quarter. Olajuwon had six points,
four blocks and three steals in 19 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The fans continued their constant booing of Pippen, who was traded from
Houston to the Trail Blazers in the offseason. Pippen had 12 points and eight
assists.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- More than 10,000 people marched in the south
coast town of Jacmel on Tuesday to protest the killing of two French citizens
and their Haitian driver last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Carrying placards that read ``No to Violence, Yes to Peace,'' protesters
walked in silence through the streets of Jacmel, a town of 130,000 people about
25 miles southwest of the capital, Port-au-Prince, the private Radio Vision 2000
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   French businessman Fernand Mullier, 54, his daughter Celine, 18, and their
Haitian driver, Aspril Aubin, were clubbed and stoned to death near Jacmel on
Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Police have arrested six suspects. Justice Minister Camille Leblanc said
robbery apparently was the motive for the slayings.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mulliers were staying at a hotel when some people arrived before dawn
and told them their driver was seriously ill and needed help.
</P>
<P>
	   Fernand Mullier left the hotel with the group. Three hours later, the
suspects returned, saying Mullier wanted his family to join him. His daughter
then left with them. Mullier's wife, Evelyne, refused. She participated in the
march Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Crime has been rising in the Caribbean country of 8 million people,
challenging its fledgling 6,200-member police force.
</P>

	   On Saturday, unidentified men killed an American woman as she returned to
Port-au-Prince from a beach hotel north of Port-au-Prince.

<P>
    NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Scott Walker scored his 100th NHL point on a
sixth-attacker goal with 21 seconds left in regulation as the Nashville
Predators tied the Phoenix Coyotes 4-4 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Predators scored twice in the final 5:26 of the third period to tie
Phoenix, the NHL's second-best road team.
</P>
<P>
	   Vitali Yachmenev scored through a maze of players in front of the goal to
draw the Predators within one, and Walker poked a rebound past fallen goalie
Sean Burke. Drake Berehowsky's shot deflected to Walker after hitting the post.
</P>
<P>
	   Burke gloved Cliff Ronning's slap shot in overtime to preserve the tie.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing 3-0, the Predators scored twice in a 24-second second span midway
through the second period. Randy Robitaille put a wrist shot past Burke, the
first power-play goal allowed by Phoenix in six games. Mark Mowers than cranked
a slap shot between Burke's pads from the top of the right circle.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeremy Roenick gave Phoenix a 4-2 lead with 11 seconds left in the period,
stealing the puck from Robitaille at center ice and beating goalie Mike Dunham
for a short-handed goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Phoenix scored twice on its first five shots of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Shane Doan banged in a pass from Juha Ylonen near the right post at 9:02,
and Travis Green made it 2-0 at 10:35. Keith Tkachuk added his 19th goal with
1:33 left in the period.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rains Cause More Floods in Venezuela  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Heavy rains caused more flooding Tuesday in a zone
devastated by killer mudslides last month, but authorities reported no deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 20 mountainside houses collapsed in Caracas, said Angel Rangel, the
national civil defense director.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, part of a key road in Vargas state along the Caribbean coast was
washed out, preventing relief workers from reaching eight coastal communities
still recovering from the December floods.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Brush fire that threatened Cape May County homes brought under  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LOWER TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - A stubborn brush fire in rural Cape May
County forced the evacuation of about 100 homes in the Town Bank section Tuesday
night. No injuries were reported.
<P>
	   The fire, which began about 5:30 p.m., was brought under control at 10:34
p.m., fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The blaze was in a marshy area of the township, on the Delaware Bay side of
the peninsula, known locally as "The Meadows."
</P>
<P>
	   Police Sgt. Bob Hartman said the fire, which was still burning late Tuesday
night and was moving north, had charred a couple hundred acres.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were people out spraying their houses with garden hoses to keep them
from catching fire," Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Flames shot 50 feet high and were as close as 20 feet to homes on Oxford
Road in Town Bank at 10:30 p.m. Five streets with about 100 homes were
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
	   About 300 firefighters from 10 fire companies battled the blaze, and New
Jersey Forest Fire Service personnel set backfires behind the homes to stop the
main body of the fire from reaching them.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire's cause was unknown.
</P>
<P>
	   Hartman said good luck and skilled firefighting saved the homes. He said the
fire reached parts of Ponder Lodge Golf Course, but did not ignite any
structures.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the evacuation order, some homeowners stayed close by as fire
trucks, their lights blazing, sat parked in front of their houses.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've got everything packed up," said Cheryl Stevenson, 44. "Some clothes,
the important papers, some photographs and my jewelry.
</P>
<P>
	   "It looks like it's going to be OK. They told me it's not going to get near
here," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   But it was near.
</P>
<P>
	   From Stevenson's back deck, flames could be seen shooting into the sky less
than 30 feet from the edge of her back yard. She said she heard sirens about 6
p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   "I smelled smoke, but I didn't see anything. But soon after that, the sky
was orange. It's very frightening," said Stevenson, who shares the home with her
boyfriend, Tim Conlin, 38.
</P>
<P>
	   Shirley Roth, 56, whose home on Oxford Road also was threatened, watched the
fire's progress with concern.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm worried about my home, believe me. It's all the way up to my fence,"
she said. "I don't want to lose everything I have."

    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A federal grand jury has indicted two men in connection
with a terrorist plot first uncovered when an Algerian man and others were
arrested at separate U.S. border crossings just before New Year's, one of them
with a carload of explosives.
<P>
	   Abdel Ghani Meskini, 31, of Brooklyn, and Mokhtar Haouari were indicted
earlier this month for violations of the federal law against providing material
support to terrorists. The indictments were unsealed in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Haouari and Meskini are accused of conspiring to transfer fake or stolen
U.S. Immigration identity cards and passports of foreign countries - including
some from Canada and France. They were also indicted for using fake credit, bank
and charge cards over the last year to buy $1,000 or more worth of merchandise.
</P>
<P>
	   The indictment did not specify what items were bought by Haouari and Meskini
with the money.
</P>
<P>
	   Each of the violations - which prosecutors said took place from Oct. 1997
through December of last year - was thought to be connected to terrorist
activity in the United States, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
	   Meskini was arrested in his Brooklyn apartment after authorities connected
him to Ahmed Ressam. Ressam, a 32-year-old Algerian national, was arrested at
the Port Angeles, Wash., border with Canada on Dec. 14 while allegedly trying to
smuggle bomb-making materials into the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Meskini, who also went by the name Eduardo Rocha and whom authorities say
has been living in the United States illegally, was traced to Ressam through a
piece of paper the Algerian man had on him when he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   Roland Thau, the attorney who represented Meskini in court last week, has
said the evidence against his client is sketchy and the charges should be
dropped.
</P>
<P>
	   Ressam has pleaded innocent and is being held without bail in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   His arrest sparked fears of a terrorist attack on U.S. soil, particularly
after a Canadian woman - Lucia Garofalo - was arrested five days later as she
tried to cross into the country at Beecher Falls, Vt. She was later linked to
Ressam through telephone records.
</P>
<P>
	   Meskini was arrested Dec. 30 in New York City and accused of attempting to
meet up with Ressam.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors have further connected Garofalo, Meskini and Ressam
through telephone records.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers for Wen Ho Lee Seek Bail  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD BENKE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Attorneys for former government scientist Wen Ho
Lee asked a federal appeals court Tuesday to grant him bail, arguing that his
right against self-incrimination was violated in denying him bail.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys Mark Holscher and John Cline urged the 10th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals to overturn rulings disallowing bail for Lee, 60, who is
charged with breaching security at Los Alamos National Laboratory by moving
classified material to unsecure computers and computer tapes.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution has said that Lee stole enough nuclear secrets to build a
functional thermonuclear weapon and called the data he downloaded the ``crown
jewels'' of American science.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense contends that U.S. Magistrate Don Svet and U.S. District Judge
James Parker denied bail based on ``far-fetched hypotheticals'' by FBI
counterintelligence agent Robert Messemer.
</P>
<P>
	   The agent suggested Lee might still have seven computer tapes he swore he
destroyed, might give them to spies and might be airlifted out of the country by
foreign agents.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite Lee's willingness to put up $100,000 bond, be electronically
monitored and overseen by a court-appointed custodian -- a Los Alamos colleague
with top-secret clearance -- the court still found no way to guarantee the
nation's secrets would be safe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the end, the district court succumbed to the government's pressure,''
the appeal says. ``Just as the spectre of national security stifled the First
Amendment rights of anti-war protesters during World War I and crushed the basic
freedoms of Japanese-Americans during World War II, so did it defeat Dr. Lee's
fundamental right to pretrial liberty.''
</P>
<P>
	   In denying bail, the District Court contended Lee should have been more
cooperative.
</P>
<P>
	   But in the appeal, the defense said: ``The district court inflicted an
impermissible penalty on Dr. Lee's exercise of his Fifth Amendment right to
silence. The court ordered Dr. Lee detained because he had not provided detailed
information about the destruction of the allegedly 'missing' tapes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors planned to respond later this month.

	   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Vermont Gov. Howard Dean is scheduled to travel to
New Hampshire on Wednesday to endorse Al Gore for president.
</P>
<P>
	   Dean's staff would not comment Tuesday, but others familiar with the
arrangements said Dean was scheduled to join the vice president at an event in
Lebanon, N.H.
</P>
<P>
	   A Democratic source also said Dean -- who has withheld his endorsement for
months -- planned to back Gore.

	   BEDFORD, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Sen. Orrin Hatch
said Tuesday that he is worried the GOP may not win back the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can tell you, it's going to be one horse race of an election,'' Hatch
said during a breakfast speech. ``And I know exactly what the media is going to
do to (Texas Gov.) George W. Bush; I know what it's going to do to (Arizona
Sen.) John McCain. And it isn't going to be pretty. And I also know what it's
going to do for Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Utah senator warned about 70 voters at a ``Politics and Eggs'' breakfast
that a Democratic president could cause a lot of damage to the country by
appointing ``judicial activists'' to the federal courts, especially the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
	   He says fellow Republicans have neglected the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This country will drastically change if Al Gore or Bill Bradley becomes
the president of the United States,'' he said. ``Many of these liberals want to
use the court ... to pass their agenda that they could never get through the
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said judges appointed by
a Democrat might impose taxes, eliminate the death penalty, weaken gun owners'
rights, impose quotas and elevate a criminals' rights over those of their
victims.

	   LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- A second Republican presidential debate could be held
in the state, possibly at Albion College before Michigan's Feb. 22 GOP
presidential primary.

	   Gov. John Engler, who supports Texas Gov. George W. Bush, said after last
week's GOP presidential matchup that he would welcome another debate, preferably
in southeast Michigan between the Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary and Michigan's
GOP contest.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan is the first major industrial state to hold a Republican primary,
making it an important state for Bush and Sen. John McCain of Arizona as they
try to capitalize on early victories in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Physics Prize Announced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- An American scientist and a Japanese colleague won an
Israeli physics prize Tuesday for their work with mysterious tiny particles
known as neutrinos.
</P>
<P>
	   Raymond Davis Jr., 85, of the University of Pennsylvania and Masatoshi
Koshiba, 73, from the University of Tokyo will share the $100,000 Wolf physics
prize, said a release from the Wolf Foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   Davis, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, developed a way to
measure neutrinos, so small they pass through matter as they rain down on earth
from space.
</P>
<P>
	   Davis' discovery reveals much about the sun's activity, the foundation said.
``These measurements were shown to provide a very stringent test for theories of
the solar interior,'' the release said.
</P>
<P>
	   Koshiba developed a detector that helps scientists determine several
characteristics about the neutrinos. His work provided evidence that neutrinos
have mass, contrary to previous theories.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf prizes are awarded annually for achievements in art, agriculture,
chemistry, mathematics, medicine and physics.

<HEADLINE> Brush fire that threatened Cape May County homes brought under  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LOWER TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - A stubborn brush fire in rural Cape May
County forced the evacuation of about 100 homes in the Town Bank section Tuesday
night.
<P>
	   No injuries were reported, and those who had been evacuated were allowed to
return to their homes at 11:20 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire, which began about 5:30 p.m., was brought under control at 10:34
p.m., fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The blaze was in a marshy area of the township, on the Delaware Bay side of

evacuated.
</P>
<P>
	   About 300 firefighters from 10 fire companies battled the blaze, and New
Jersey Forest Fire Service personnel set backfires behind the homes to stop the
main body of the fire from reaching them.
</P>
<P>
	   By 11:45 p.m., most of the firefighters had left the scene. Those who
remained were working to extinguish small pockets of fire, Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire's cause was unknown.
</P>
<P>
	   Hartman said good luck and skilled firefighting saved the homes. He said the

<HEADLINE> Rockets 90, Trail Blazers 89  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL A. LUTZ AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOUSTON (AP) -- It was all Houston's sellout crowd could ask for: another
chance to boo Scottie Pippen and to see the Rockets beat the Portland Trail
Blazers.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Francis scored 26 points, including six in the final 3:37, as the
Rockets held off the Trail Blazers 90-89 Tuesday night for their season-high,
fourth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the first time for me to win four in a row in the NBA and it really
feels good," Francis said. "With all the injuries that we have had and Hakeem
(Olajuwon) less than 100 percent, we still have the will power as a team to get
things done."
</P>
<P>
	   With the Rockets trailing 84-82, Francis hit two free throws with 3:37 to
play and he added a layup with 2:19 to go that put the Rockets ahead for good. A
17-foot jumper by Francis and two free throws by Anthony Miller increased the
lead to 90-84 with 1:23 left.
</P>
<P>
	   It was Pippen's second visit to Houston since the Rockets traded him in the
offseason and he was razzed each time he touched the ball. Pippen had 12 points
and eight assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Pippen didn't want to talk about taunts but he was impressed with Francis
and fellow rookie Kenny Thomas, who had a career-high 22 points and 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Francis had 12 assists for the second straight game
</P>
<P>
	   "They played well, they did what they had to do to win," Pippen said. "Kenny
Thomas stepped up and hit some big shots. He was spectacular. He gave them the
inside scoring they needed."
</P>
<P>
	   After Houston took a six-point lead, Rasheed Wallace completed a three-point
play with 1:05 to play and Pippen added a layup with 34 seconds to play to cut
Houston's lead to one.
</P>
<P>
	   Portland got two chances to win, but Pippen missed a driving layup with 5.7
seconds to play and Greg Anthony's final shot bounced off the rim.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was the first option on the play," Pippen said. "I always expect to get
the call. You saw what happened."
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Smith led the Trail Blazers with 21 points and Wallace finished with
17.
</P>
<P>
	   Francis got hot in the third quarter, leading a 15-4 Houston run that gave
the Rockets a 67-64 lead with 2:39 left in the third quarter. Francis had eight
points in the run and the Rockets led 73-71 after three.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this is our most impressive win of the year," Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. "Yes, we had beaten the Lakers, but this was like a road game
for us with the back to backs, but to overcome the adversity of the first half
with all the changes we've had is phenomenal."
</P>
<P>
	   Olajuwon played before the home crowd for the first time after missing 20
games recovering from hernia surgery and drew loud applause when he entered with
game with 2:59 left in the first quarter. Olajuwon had six points, four blocks
and three steals in 19 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was a big win for them," Pippen said. "They beat one of the top teams
in the NBA. Sometimes a win like this can turn a whole season around. They are
very scrappy and they play hard."

<P>
	   The appeal said the prosecution failed to prove Lee was a flight risk and

provide more information about seven missing computer tapes.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense contends that U.S. Magistrate Don Svet and U.S. District Judge

Pentagon's Missile Test Fails
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an apparent setback on the Pentagon's drive to develop
a national missile defense, a prototype missile interceptor streaked into space
Tuesday night in search of a mock warhead launched from an Air Force base in
California but failed to hit the target, a Pentagon official announced. "An
intercept was not achieved for reasons unknown at this time," spokesman Air
Force Lt. Col. Rick Lehner said. The mock warhead was meant to simulate a
nuclear attack on the United States. The interceptor rocket was launched from a
U.S. Army missile range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands at 9:19 p.m.
EST and headed over the Pacific Ocean.

Lawyers for Wen Ho Lee Seek Bail
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Attorneys for former government scientist Wen Ho
Lee asked a federal appeals court Tuesday to grant him bail, arguing that his
right against self-incrimination was violated. The lawyers urged the 10th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn rulings disallowing bail for Lee, 60, who
is charged with breaching security at Los Alamos National Laboratory by moving
classified material to unsecure computers and computer tapes. The prosecution
has said that Lee stole enough nuclear secrets to build a functional
thermonuclear weapon and called the data he downloaded the "crown jewels" of
American science.

India, Pakistan Warned To Tone Down
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Three U.S. delegations are whirling through
Pakistan this week, all carrying the same message for their host and neighboring
India: "Turn down the heat." Last month's hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane
unleashed a blistering war of words between the two rival countries -- who also
happen to be the world's newest nuclear powers. Pakistan's military leader, Gen.
Pervez Musharraf, has warned India he's not a man to turn the other cheek to the
relentless "flak from across the border." S.K. Singh, a former top official in
India's Foreign Ministry, responded that Musharraf's comment was regarded as "a
threat, which we take very seriously."

McCain Challenges Bush on Web Taxes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- John McCain signed a pledge not to tax Internet sales
Tuesday, saying "we should not harm this baby in the cradle," and challenged
George W. Bush to take the same stand. Bush declined and advised New Hampshire
voters to take a critical look at McCain's own tax plan. The Republican
presidential contenders also took their tax arguments to the airwaves in new
ads. Bush said McCain trusts "the people of Washington" rather than the people
of New Hampshire to spend money. McCain said that unlike Bush, "I won't take
every last dime of the surplus and spend it on tax cuts that mostly benefit the
wealthy."

	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Two black legislators staged a sit-in Tuesday to
protest Gov. Jeb Bush's executive order repealing affirmative action programs
for state contracts and university admissions. After meeting with Lt. Gov. Frank
Brogan, a key player in the November repeal decision, Sen. Kendrick Meek of
Miami and Rep. Tony Hill of Jacksonville -- both democrats -- refused to leave
after he told them the Republican governor would not change his mind. The two
held forth into the night with eight reporters who also decided to spend the
night. Meek said they would stay "as long as it takes."
