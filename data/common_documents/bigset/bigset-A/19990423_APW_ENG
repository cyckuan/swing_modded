<HEADLINE> Shooting Spurs Entertainment Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Littleton school massacre has intensified a  
debate over whether the entertainment industry has helped create 
what some call a culture of violence with morbid computer games, 
music about death and drugs, and movies about kids who solve their 
problems with cruel mind games and murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can no longer shut our eyes to the impact that the media is  
having on all of our children and on the potentially violent impact 
it's having on some,'' first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a 
speech Thursday night in upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar sentiments have been aired this week by Vice President  
Al Gore's wife, Tipper Gore, Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, a state 
senator in Michigan and a Colorado group calling itself Hollywood 
Against Violent Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do our children have to witness before we get mad enough  
to act?'' the group said in a full-page ad Thursday in the 
Hollywood Reporter. ``Doesn't it make you wonder from where they're 
getting these violent ideas? How horrific does our entertainment 
have to become to be entertaining?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A music industry group, the Recording Industry Association of  
America, said in a statement it was ``shocked and pained'' by the 
Colorado rampage, but called blame directed at the record industry 
misguided. 
</P>
<P>
	``Music does not drive teen-agers to violent despair nor does it  
put guns and weapons in the hands of children,'' the group said. 
``It's too easy to make music a scapegoat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Mark Johnson, producer of the Oscar-winning ``Rain Man'' and  
executive producer of TV's ``L.A. Doctors,'' said ``We have to 
accept responsibility'' for ``this world in which violence is just 
like Muzak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We can no longer sit back and say: 'Come on, it's freedom of  
speech. It's not our responsibility; it's the parent's 
responsibility,'' he said. ``It's got to stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same concerns have been pondered by the public in the days  
since two teen-agers opened fire at Columbine High School on 
Tuesday, killing 13 people before taking their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
	A USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll this week showed 49 percent of  
respondents believed the popular media, including movies, 
television and music, had a ``great deal'' of blame for the 
Colorado shootings. (A larger percentage of respondents, however, 
placed blame on parents and the availability of guns.) 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-two percent said they considered restrictions on TV and  
movie violence as ``very effective'' means to help stop school 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet, meanwhile, was full of spirited responses by fans  
of the violent computer game Doom, which one of the gunmen in the 
Littleton shootings, Eric Harris, had said he liked to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doom has nothing to do with this,'' said one person on a Doom  
Web site, in a typical response. ``I enjoy making Doom more 
gruesome, I watch movies such as 'Evil Dead 2' and `Terminator 2,' 
and I listen to ... (rocker) Rob Zombie, but I don't even want to 
touch a real gun, bomb, chain saw, or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Rickard, with the Denver Police Department's gang unit,  
said emotional problems with roots in the home life -- and not 
entertainment -- appear to have the biggest influence on why 
children turn to gangs and violence. He found many youths go to 
gangs or cults seeking acceptance, a feeling of self worth and a 
sense of identity. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added: ``A lot times entertainment -- music, movies -- is  
the trigger. It's not the cause, necessarily, it's the little push 
that makes them do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that he observed in the 1970s that the violent ``Dirty  
Harry'' police movies had ``a lot of cops emulating that kind of 
attitude on the streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If a movie can affect a police officer, why can't it affect a  
kid?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood has clearly found a market in films about teen  
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	This year has already seen a number of movies with the  
high-school-is-hell theme, including ``Jawbreaker'' about members 
of a bad girl clique who accidentally kill a girl during a prank 
and ``Cruel Intentions'' about high schoolers who toy with people's 
emotions for fun. This summer, there's the black comedy ``Drop Dead 
Gorgeous'' about a teen beauty pageant plagued by a string of 
violent deaths.

<HEADLINE> Judge Ruling Favors Driver Stewart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAU CLAIRE, Wis. (AP) -- A judge ruled Friday that Tony Stewart  
can drive for any Indianapolis 500 competitor, rather than his 
former team, Team Menard. 
</P>
<P>
	John Menard, who owns building supply company Menard Inc. of Eau  
Claire, sued Stewart claiming breach of contract. Menard had tried 
to keep Stewart from driving for another team in the race May 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Eau Claire County Judge Greg Peterson said Friday the contract  
between Menard and Stewart was not clear enough to make Stewart 
race for Menard in the 1999 Indy 500. 
</P>
<P>
	A restraining order was issued last week prohibiting Stewart  
from testing, practicing, qualifying or racing for any competitors 
of Team Menard. 
</P>
<P>
	The Team Menard lawsuit asked for at least $500,000 from Stewart  
on its breach of contract claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The episode is unfortunate, Cary Agajanian, Stewart's agent,  
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart has driven for Team Menard since 1996, the year he won  
rookie of the year honors in the Indy 500. He moved on last year to 
drive for Joe Gibbs in the NASCAR Winston Cup series and is signed 
to drive in the Indy 500 for Tri-Star Motorsports. 
</P>
<P>
	Tri-Star is an Indy team Stewart put together with Larry Curry,  
his former Menard team manager, and Andy Card, a former Menard 
public relations man. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary sponsor for Stewart's Winston Cup and Indy cars is  
Home Depot, a competitor to Menard's home improvement business. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart has fulfilled all obligations to Team Menard, said David  
Steinberg, Stewart's Los Angeles lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	In its lawsuit, Team Menard said Stewart's decision not to drive  
for the team in Indianapolis damages Team Menard's competitiveness 
and its reputation and ability to attract sponsorships. Team Menard 
said it has lost profits because of Stewart's decision, which has 
made it difficult for Team Menard to prepare for this year's race.

<HEADLINE>  Russia Urges Final Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- The Palestinians should extend the  
period of autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza beyond May 4 and reach 
agreement with Israel on a new deadline for a final peace accord, 
Russia's foreign minister said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking after a two-hour meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser  
Arafat, Igor Ivanov reaffirmed Russia's support of Palestinian 
independence and demanded that Israel halt Jewish settlement 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are waiting for the time when Palestine will appear on the  
world map,'' Ivanov said, noting that Russia was among the nations 
that recognized a Nov. 15, 1988, independence declaration by the 
Palestine National Council, the Palestinians' parliament in exile. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Ivanov accompanied Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel  
Sharon on a helicopter flight over the West Bank. Sharon, a former 
defense minister, likes to show visitors how much of the West Bank 
he believes Israel has to retain for security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Friday about the trip, Ivanov said: ``The Russian position  
on the issue of settlement has not changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov said he delivered to Arafat a letter by Russian President  
Boris Yeltsin, who assured the Palestinians of continued Russian 
support. Russia is one of the co-sponsors of the Mideast peace 
process that was launched in 1991 with the Madrid conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov would not say how much of an extension of the autonomy  
period Russia favored. The European Union has said peace talks 
should conclude in a year and lead to Palestinian statehood. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians have also asked the United States to propose a  
target date, but the Clinton administration apparently is reluctant 
to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat initially said he would declare independence in the West  
Bank and Gaza on May 4, the date the Palestinians consider to be 
the end of the five-year interim period of autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in consultations with world leaders in recent weeks,  
Arafat has been urged to reconsider. There is concern that a 
unilateral Palestinian move would trigger Israeli retaliations, 
including the annexation of parts of the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat has signaled in recent days that he would not take action  
on May 4 and instead extend the period of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	From Ramallah, Ivanov was to leave for Egypt and Syria.

<HEADLINE> NHL Playoffs Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Go figure the Philadelphia Flyers. Regarded as underdogs even  
before the loss of Eric Lindros, the Flyers are suddenly one-up on 
the Toronto Maple Leafs in the NHL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only one game, but it's a great start for us,''  
Philadelphia's John LeClair said after the Flyers beat the league's 
highest-scoring team 3-0 at Toronto on Thursday night. ``Hopefully, 
we can build off of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs, who scored 268 goals in 82 games during the  
regular season, couldn't get one past John Vanbiesbrouck in the 
opener of the Eastern Conference series. Vanbiesbrouck made 25 
saves, including one on a penalty shot by Mats Sundin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime a goaltender does that for a team, it's a big lift,''  
LeClair said. ``Everybody got a big boost on that penalty shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers will likely play the postseason without Lindros,  
their captain and leading scorer who is recuperating from a 
collapsed lung. 
</P>
<P>
	In other playoff action Thursday night, it was Boston 2,  
Carolina 0; New Jersey 3, Pittsburgh 1; and St. Louis 3, Phoenix 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Jose-Colorado game was canceled for the second straight  
night because of the shootings at a suburban high school outside of 
Denver. That series won't start until Saturday night at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	The playoffs continue tonight with Edmonton at Dallas, Anaheim  
at Detroit and Buffalo at Ottawa. Dallas, Detroit and Buffalo lead 
their respective best-of-7 series 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanbiesbrouck stopped Sundin's penalty shot in the first minute  
of the third period to help the Flyers maintain a 2-0 lead built on 
goals by Valeri Zelepukin and LeClair. Toronto was given the shot 
when Steve Duchesne grabbed the puck in his team's crease. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Desjardins finished the scoring with an empty-netter in the  
final minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just didn't score on our chances,'' Sundin said. ``We  
created a lot of stuff, but weren't able to capitalize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs won eight more games and finished four points  
better than the Flyers this season. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Bruins 2, Hurricanes 0    	
</P>
<P>
	Unlikely scorers Rob DiMaio and Ken Belanger netted third-period  
goals as Boston defeated Carolina in the franchise's first NHL 
playoff game since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaio had seven goals during the regular season and Belanger  
had two, but the pair scored 5:47 apart to break a scoreless tie 
and give the Bruins a 1-0 lead in the best-of-7 Eastern Conference 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Byron Dafoe, who led the league with 10 shutouts, stopped all 19  
shots by the Southeast Conference champion Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina, which moved from Hartford two years ago, played most  
of its first playoff game in the state of North Carolina without 
veteran Ron Francis. He injured his right ankle midway through the 
first period. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Devils 3, Penguins 1    	
</P>
<P>
	Petr Sykora scored twice and New Jersey started making amends  
for recent playoff failures by beating Pittsburgh in the opener of 
their Eastern Conference series at Continental Airlines Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Brodeur had 24 saves, Patrik Elias set up two goals and  
Jay Pandolfo scored into an empty net as the Devils struggled more 
than expected against the eighth-seeded Penguins, who had more good 
scoring chances than New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Hrdina was the only Penguin to beat Brodeur, but the Devils'  
goalie had to come up with at least seven good stops to prevent 
Pittsburgh from tying the game at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Blues 3, Coyotes 1    	
</P>
<P>
	Al MacInnis had a goal and two assists as St. Louis won at  
Phoenix in their Western Conference opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant Fuhr had 26 saves and didn't allow a goal until Robert  
Reichel put a wrist shot past him with 1:52 left in the game. Scott 
Pellerin scored into an empty net in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuhr also assisted on the play as he improved to 87-44 in the  
postseason, with 16 victories in 17 games against the former 
Winnipeg Jets. His 87th win moved him one behind No. 2 Billy Smith 
on the career playoff-victory list. Colorado's Patrick Roy leads 
all goalies with 99.

<HEADLINE> Hoop Stars Said To Fight on Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Pistons teammates Christian Laettner  
and Jerry Stackhouse got into a fist fight over a card game on the 
team plane, the Detroit Free Press reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper quoted an unidentified player who said he saw the  
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked up and they were going at it, throwing blows,'' the  
player said. ``I wasn't about to get in the middle of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One unidentified source told the newspaper the players were  
arguing over $2,000, and Stackhouse struck Laettner's face. The 
Pistons were returning from a game at Charlotte, and the Free Press 
said the Pistons intend to ban card games on future flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman Matt Dobek on Friday dismissed the report of the  
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was on the plane and nothing happened,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Detroit has lost three straight games and seven of its last 10.  
The Pistons are 23-20 on the season and fourth in the Central 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Laettner has been out of the lineup since breaking a rib April 1  
against Chicago. The report said he did not reinjure it in the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Stackhouse has an injured right ankle. His 12-point, 22-minute  
effort in Thursday's 104-96 loss to Philadelphia was his best since 
he was injured March 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Laettner met with coach Alvin Gentry before the game, the  
newspaper said. His return to the lineup could come Sunday at 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll probably be a game-time decision when a decision is  
made,'' Gentry said. ``It could be a 70-30 chance for Sunday or 
60-40. I just don't know. It's more than just missing his 
toughness. He's a 6-10 guy who can get the tough rebound, make the 
tough shot or take a hard foul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The toughest thing about this past month is we haven't had our  
whole team together,'' Gentry added. ``When we were at full 
strength I thought we were a pretty good team. We played good teams 
and we beat good teams.''

<HEADLINE>  Schrader Wins Talladega Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLADEGA, Ala. (AP) -- The latest trend in qualifying at  
Talladega Superspeedway is to build momentum on the first lap by 
driving the high line on the banked oval, then taking the low line 
for the speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really know if that works or not,'' Ken Schrader said  
Friday after winning the pole for the DieHard 500 with a sizzling 
lap of 197.765 mph. ``But if those other guys are doing it, I guess 
I've got to try it, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far so good for Schrader, who won the pole for the Winston  
500 here last fall and also took the top qualifying spot for 
Saturday's Busch Series race on the 2.66-mile, high-banked oval, 
the fastest track in NASCAR. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Schrader has 23 Winston Cup poles, but just four  
victories. As nice as it is to lead qualifying, the 43-year-old 
driver would really like to emulate what Bobby Labonte did here 
last spring, winning from the pole. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can (win),'' Schrader said. ``There's a lot of guys that  
can. You just have to stay out of trouble all day, and that ain't 
easy at this place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for winning the pole, Schrader gave most of the credit to his  
crew and his Chevrolet, the same car in which he won the pole last 
October, then qualified third and finished sixth in the Daytona 500 
in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``The driver didn't do much today,'' he said. ``It makes a big  
difference what kind of ride you have. The guys at the shop had the 
car all geared up. It was good in practice and the guys don't put 
the whole (qualifying) package on it in practice, so we knew it 
would be close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte was close behind in a Pontiac at 197.488, followed by  
the Ford of series points leader Jeff Burton at 197.252. 
</P>
<P>
	With the cars nearing 200 mph again, despite the carburetor  
restrictor plates required by NASCAR at Talladega and Daytona, 
Schrader was asked why the speeds keep increasing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's just done a good job of getting the cars down to  
the ground and everybody's done a good job of getting more 
horsepower,'' he said. ``They just keep making the cars slicker. 
Nobody backs up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte, almost healed from the shoulder he broke in a crash  
earlier this season in Darlington, S.C., said, ``You just expect to 
be fast at Talladega. The numbers don't mean much. If it's 193 or 
196 or 199, it's fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Nemechek was fourth in the opening qualifying session at  
197.187, followed by Rusty Wallace at 196.616, Mark Martin at 
196.584, Ricky Rudd at 196.362, rookie Tony Stewart at 196.346, 
Chad Little at 196.065 and, rounding out the top 10, Michael 
Waltrip at 195.989. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Gordon, the two-time defending Winston Cup champion, was a  
little disappointed after qualifying 13th at 195.880. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pole at Daytona and now 13th here,'' Gordon lamented.  
``We're starting further back than I'd like to. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ran about what we tested here, but we thought when it came  
to qualifying we'd pick up. It felt like it was going to be a good 
lap, but we've been a little off all day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we'll go to work on the race setup. I think we'll be good  
Sunday,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 25 qualifiers nailed down starting spots in the race,  
with fan favorites Dale Earnhardt and Bill Elliott 17th and 18th, 
series runner-up Dale Jarrett 23rd and John Andretti, last Sunday's 
winner at Martinsville, 24th. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who will have to stand on their first-round laps or  
try again on Saturday in the final time trials were Jimmy Spencer, 
Bobby Hamilton, Darrell Waltrip, Kyle Petty, Ted Musgrave and 
rookies Buckshot Jones and Elliott Sadler.

<HEADLINE> Science, Computers Lure More Girls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Alissa Alexander, 14, munched a sandwich at a  
``Take Our Daughters to Work Day'' forum Thursday and pondered why 
she was one of the few girls in her school who liked computers. ``I 
guess that's not what they want to do,'' she said uncertainly. 
</P>
<P>
	Daughters to Work day, now in its seventh year, is helping to  
change that. Science and techno-fun, from shooting commercials to 
watching surgeons work, is a growing part of the event, now in its 
seventh year. 
</P>
<P>
	That's partly because -- slowly -- more girls are drawn to such  
fields. But it's also due to parents and organizers who are doing 
more to expose girls to traditionally male-dominated careers, 
knowing that as they grow, girls lose confidence and turn away from 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important for women today to recognize that we're not  
there yet,'' said Carol Jo Crannell, a NASA astrophysicist who 
spoke to the Women in Technology forum Alissa visited at New York's 
Polytechnic University. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm seeing a lot more women these days, I'm seeing them as  
colleagues,'' the scientist told 200 parents, friends and girls -- 
some rapt, some fidgeting -- from the university and nearby 
companies. ``But we've got a lot of work to do, especially in 
physics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Little by little, women are becoming chemists, engineers, or  
astronauts. In 1988, just 286 women earned doctoral degrees in 
engineering, making up 5 percent of the total. By 1995, women made 
up 10 percent of the students who earned a Ph.D. in that field, 
according to the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gradually, more is being done in schools and elsewhere to expose  
girls to these fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``Technology is being incorporated into just about every  
classroom,'' said Deborah Parker, director of studies at the 
private Marlborough School for girls in Los Angeles. ``We also put 
a lot of energy into thinking how girls best learn science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Daughters to Work Day, the school allows all of its 500  
students to visit work sites, and every year, the number of 
activities involving science and technology has risen, to 25 
percent of the total this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Marlborough girls followed an emergency room doctor on  
rounds at Glendale Adventist Hospital, while four others visited an 
active earthquake fault with a geophysicist from the U.S. 
Geological Survey in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Even workplaces that aren't primarily technological are getting  
into the act, often because their visitors are eager for such 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Two year ago, accountants Ernst &AMP; Young set up a videoconference  
so employees' children worldwide could ``meet.'' This year, girls 
in New York produced a commercial and learned financial skills on a 
Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to do something that has relevancy and purpose,''  
said Mark Sivin, national director of human resources. ``Clearly in 
today's world, technology is a major component to how we operate 
both today and tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Boston City Hall, organizers of the day were surprised by how  
eager girls were to learn about technology when they included a 
tour of the city's computer department just for older girls four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't get them out of there,'' laughed Marie Turley,  
executive director for the city Women's Commission. ``Then, they 
kept asking for it in their evaluations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the city has invited all girls to the computer  
activities planned for each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The MIS (Management Information System) room is really fun  
because they're showing us how to put maps in the computer and find 
our houses,'' gushed Kerry, a 10-year-old Bostonian who loves 
science and wants to be a movie star. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, meanwhile, the Women in Technology Forum at  
Polytechnic University inspired Alissa's aunt, Sheila Patrick, to 
recollect why she'd broken many a barrier to become a black, female 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
	``What stirred me to engineering was I was exposed to it,'' she  
recalled, as Alissa and two friends sat beside her. ``I went to 
something like this event when I was in junior high school. And 
when I heard that there weren't too many women in engineering, I 
took that as a challenge.''

<HEADLINE> Mobil's Earnings Fall 34 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- Mobil Corp. reported its first-quarter  
earnings fell 34 percent, the result of depressed crude prices that 
have eroded profits for most oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's second-largest oil company, which plans to merge  
with Exxon Corp., said it earned $464 million, or 58 cents per 
share, down from $705 million, or 86 cents per share, in the first 
quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobil beat the expectations of Wall Street analysts who  
predicted it would earn 54 cents per share, according to First Call 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter revenues fell to $12.18 billion from $13.63  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	During the quarter, the price of crude oil dropped $2.70 per  
barrel, Mobil said. Demand for oil and refined products has fallen 
because of weak economic conditions in Asia, Latin America, Russia 
and other parts of the world, forcing oil companies to lower the 
prices they charge customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure on profits has prompted oil companies including  
Mobil to seek merger partners to cut operating costs. Exxon 
announced last year that it plans to acquire Mobil for about $73.7 
billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would be the largest merger ever and create the world's  
biggest company. The deal is expected to lead to the loss of about 
9,000 jobs, or 7 percent of the companies' worldwide work force. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobil's first-quarter net income included a $7 million charge  
for merger-related costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's exploration and producing division had $231  
million in 1999 first-quarter earnings compared with a $390 million 
a year earlier. Its marketing and refining division earnings fell 
to $291 million from $325 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobil also saw sharply lower profit in its chemical division,  
where earnings fell to $6 million from $67 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil prices have risen in recent weeks, offering oil companies  
the prospect of a better second quarter.

<HEADLINE> NATO Resolves To Continue Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Western leaders transformed a 50th anniversary  
celebration of NATO into a somber war council Friday, pledging to 
intensify military strikes against Yugoslavia and vowing ``no 
compromise'' on demands that Slobodan Milosevic withdraw his troops 
from Kosovo. ``When we fight, we fight to prevail,'' President 
Clinton declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Without dissent, presidents and prime ministers of 19 nations  
pledged that the 1.4 million ethnic Albanian refugees forced from 
their homes will be able to return to ``live in peace and 
security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not allow this campaign of terror to succeed,'' the  
leaders asserted. ``NATO is determined to prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a flag-bedecked, columned auditorium -- the same place where  
NATO was born on April 4, 1949 -- the heads of state and government 
walked to a podium to sign the Washington declaration, a ``vision 
statement'' of the challenges awaiting NATO in the next century. It 
said the alliance will have to confront terrorism and the spread of 
weapons of mass destruction even as it fulfills its original 
mandate for collective defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo hung in the air, dampening the celebratory spirit.  
</P>
<P>
	``This alliance, which was forged in adversity, is today  
confronted with a new challenge in Kosovo, and I know it will 
overcome this challenge with success,'' French President Jacques 
Chirac said. 
</P>
<P>
	A summit statement on Kosovo made no mention of the possibility  
of sending in ground troops -- a subject on which alliance leaders 
are divided. A U.S. official said the matter came up briefly in a 
few presentations but there was a general sense the air campaign 
was working. Even so, they endorsed updating NATO's assessment of a 
ground invasion and letting the public know that all options were 
being studied. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement also pledged to intensify economic sanctions and  
welcomed an oil embargo imposed by the European Union. But it did 
not embrace a naval blockade proposed by the United States to keep 
oil shipments away. 
</P>
<P>
	France and other governments questioned the legality of  
intercepting tankers at sea without a formal war declaration, a 
U.S. official said. Several allies favored extending the air 
campaign to bombing oil-truck convoys driving into Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders directed their defense ministers to determine how  
NATO could halt the delivery of war material -- including by 
launching ``maritime operations.'' Sandy Berger, Clinton's national 
security adviser, said there was a mandate to develop an 
interdiction system. But American officials were not optimistic 
about reaching an agreement by the summit's end Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme commander for Europe, flew in  
from Brussels, Belgium, and briefed the leaders on the 31-day 
bombing campaign against Milosevic. ``We're winning. He's losing. 
And he knows it,'' Clark said. NATO kept pounding Yugoslavia as the 
summit opened, striking Serbia state television and knocking it off 
the air for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that damage continues,'' British Prime  
Minister Tony Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis, a critic of NATO's policy  
toward Yugoslavia, said that using ground forces would aggravate 
tensions rather than ease them. And he said he told Clinton that 
prolonging the air campaign would make it more difficult to bring 
about peace. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit welcomed three new member nations that had been ruled  
by Moscow during the Cold War: Poland, Hungary and the Czech 
Republic. ``By joining NATO, this century of suffering and 
uncertainty is finally over,'' said Hungarian President Arpad 
Goncz. Poland's president, Aleksander Kwasniewski, said, ``The 
dreams of our fathers and grandfathers have now come true. ... The 
doors to NATO must stay open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The summit stretched from a three-hour morning meeting in the  
sprawling Ronald Reagan building -- second in size only to the 
Pentagon -- to a White House dinner in the chandeliered East Room. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders, Republicans and Democrats alike, staged  
their own welcome in the Rotunda for NATO's newest members. The 
summit also brought to Washington the leaders of nearly two dozen 
nations sharing a partnership with NATO -- although Russia and 
Belarus boycotted in protest of the bombing of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Without equivocation, summit leaders pledged to stop Milosevic  
and set out the conditions he must meet to call off NATO's 
airstrikes: Stop all violence, withdraw his military and police 
forces, agree to the stationing of an international military force, 
permit the safe return of all refugees and accept autonomy for 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement warned Milosevic not to widen the war to frontline  
states such as Albania and Macedonia, promising that NATO would 
respond. It said the alliance would suspend airstrikes once 
Yugoslavia had ``demonstrably begun to withdraw its forces from 
Kosovo according to a precise and rapid timetable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gen. Clark acknowledged, ``President Milosevic has shown  
a willingness to tolerate a high level of damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said the United States was pleased by the summit  
statement: ``The almost universal chorus was: 'We're going to 
continue the air campaign, we're going to intensify the air 
campaign and we're going to win.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The allies dismissed a Russian initiative to settle the conflict  
since Belgrade still refused to accept a NATO-led military force to 
enforce peace. Still, the leaders said Moscow had ``an important 
role to play in the search for a solution to the conflict in 
Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders said they would seek a U.N. Security Council  
resolution to require the withdrawal of Serb forces. But they have 
not sought approval for the airstrikes from the Security Council, 
where Russia has veto power.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Open Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures were higher in early  
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans opened higher after taking a dive Thursday on reports  
that China will impose a tax on soybean meal imports. That was 
coupled with other bearish news to drag on soybean prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But early today there was bullish news with forecasts for rain  
next week in growing regions of the central United States, which 
could delay planting. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures were higher on the same forecasts for rain, which  
was expected to further set back planting. Corn was lower Thursday 
on predictions of a pattern of dry weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures followed corn and soybeans higher in early  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans for July delivery jumped 2 cents to $4.93 3/4 a bushel;  
July corn rose 1 cent to $2.26 1/4 a bushel; July wheat rose 1/2 cent to 
$2.68 a bushel; July oats rose 1/2 cents to $1.20 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle was mixed and feeder cattle lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while lean hogs were higher and pork bellies 
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .03 cent to 62.70 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle fell .17 cent to 70.65 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
jumped .70 cent to 56.30 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose .60 
cent to 55.90 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Colorado Attack Recalls 1927 Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATH, Mich. (AP) -- A historical marker in this central Michigan  
town commemorates the day in 1927 that nearly extinguished its 
soul: more than 40 people killed when a farmer angry over his tax 
bill set off dynamite at the local school. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing the same kind of devastation now confronting Coloradans,  
the people of Bath forced themselves to go on by concentrating on 
the 200 children who still needed an education. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing that helped them was their immediate quest to build  
a new school. This was the only thing that helped some of these 
people keep their sanity,'' said Bath historian Gene Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, eighth-grade students in Bath have created tiles honoring  
some of the blast victims. The tiles show hearts and praying hands, 
apples and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	The cupola once atop the Bath Consolidated School now rests in  
the park containing the historical marker, its red roof topped with 
a small spire. Across the street are the schools built since the 
May 18, 1927 blast. Newspaper accounts of the explosion are 
displayed near the middle school auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkins said the Bath explosion, like this week's deadly attack  
at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., was fueled by anger 
and bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Kehoe, a farmer who served as treasurer of the local  
school board, was furious with new taxes levied to pay for the then 
5-year-old school. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of the spring in 1927, Kehoe strung wires and hid  
dynamite in the basement of the 250-student school about 10 miles 
northeast of Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
	School administrators thought Kehoe, known for his  
penny-pinching ways, was doing odd jobs to save the school the 
expense of hiring an electrician. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kehoe, afraid he'd lose his farm to foreclosure and livid  
over the new tax, was systematically wiring together dynamite at 
the school and on his farm as he looked for a way to punish Bath's 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes before 9:45 that sunny May morning, Kehoe entered  
the school. Most students were inside, finishing up exams the day 
before school was to recess for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	When Kehoe left, he was almost running. Two minutes after he  
drove away, the north wing of the school exploded. A malfunction 
kept more than 500 pounds of dynamite in the rest of the school 
from detonating, but what did go off tore through glass, wood and 
bricks, leveling the south wing. 
</P>
<P>
	As parents and residents rushed toward the blast, Kehoe drove  
back into the school yard. He motioned school Superintendent Emory 
Huyck over to his car, spoke to him briefly, then aimed a shot from 
his gun into the back seat, setting off more dynamite. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the roar from the two explosions faded, 38 children,  
the town's postmaster, a retired farmer, the superintendent, two 
teachers and Kehoe himself were dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The next morning, the body of Kehoe's wife was found where he  
had apparently killed her the morning of the blast. His house and 
six outbuildings on his farm had burned, set afire by explosions 
he'd programmed to go off after he left for the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, a granite stone with the engraved names of the victims  
rests next to a green plaque that relates the story of the 
explosion. The park with the markers is on the site of the old 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	At the nearby middle school, a fading newspaper photo shows a  
fence at Kehoe's farm the day of the blast. In stark black 
lettering, Kehoe had painted a fence rail to read: ``Criminals are 
Made, Not Born.''

<HEADLINE> Puzzles of Colo. Gunmen Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Dylan Klebold, one of the Columbine High  
gunmen said by classmates to have openly admired Adolf Hitler, was 
the great-grandson of a prominent Jewish philanthropist in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one more puzzle regarding the pair of misfit teens who  
worried other students with their talk of vengeance but impressed 
some adults, including a court officer, as bright young men with 
promising futures. 
</P>
<P>
	Long before Tuesday's murderous rampage, Klebold, 17, was known  
around his high school as an admirer of Hitler and the Nazis. He 
and fellow gunman Eric Harris, 18, would talk German in the 
hallways and hurl insults at Jews, blacks and Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Klebold's mother, Susan Klebold, is the granddaughter of the  
late Leo Yassenoff, a wealthy commercial real-estate developer in 
Columbus, Ohio, and a prominent figure in the Jewish community 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Yassenoff was active at the Temple Israel and donated enough  
money to the Jewish Community Center of Columbus that it named the 
center after him. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Klebold was ``definitely brought up Jewish,'' said Skip  
Yassenoff, 49, a distant cousin who grew up with her in Columbus. 
Yassenoff said Susan's husband, Thomas Klebold, is not Jewish; he 
said he didn't know how Dylan and his older brother, Byron, were 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how it can be more awful,'' said Yassenoff, who  
still lives in Columbus. ``I really can't imagine the pain of my 
cousin and her husband and the parents of the other boy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Littleton, court officials anguished over another  
contradictory side of Harris and Klebold: Less than three months 
before their carefully planned assault, they convinced a court 
officer that they had great prospects for staying out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-agers last year entered a so-called diversion program  
that enabled them to clear their records after they were caught 
breaking into a car. They performed 45 hours of community service, 
received counseling and wrote apology letters. Harris also received 
anger-management counseling, which he enjoyed, his diversion 
officer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eric is a very bright young man who is likely to succeed in  
life,'' the unnamed officer wrote in court documents. ``He is 
intelligent enough to achieve lofty goals as long as he stays on 
task and remains motivated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Dylan has earned the right for an early termination,'' the  
officer wrote. ``He is intelligent enough to make any dream a 
reality but he needs to understand hard work is part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Dave Thomas said the teens made a calculated  
effort to impress their diversion officer. Thomas said the officer 
is so upset that he is worried about him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's anguishing over what happened here,'' Thomas said. ``He's  
a very dedicated, committed public servant. He did the best he 
could, I believe. Most of us in the system wish we were human 
lie-detectors, but we're not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officer's name has not been released; it was blacked out on  
the documents provided to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Other adults said they were lulled into complacency by the  
teens' middle-class upbringing and caring parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold lived in a home worth nearly $400,000, a modernistic  
cedar-and-glass structure tucked between two huge stone formations 
on a rural road. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Klebold, 52, is a former geophysicist who now runs a  
mortgage management business from his home. His wife, 50, has 
worked for the Colorado community-college system for years, helping 
disabled students gain access to education. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Briand, who knows Ms. Klebold from his work as a  
community-development consultant at Arapahoe Community College, 
said Thomas Klebold is a liberal who favors gun control, and Ms. 
Klebold is a sensitive listener. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I can tell, this family was utterly, utterly  
normal,'' Briand said. ``They did everything right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris moved to Littleton in 1996 from Plattsburgh, N.Y., where  
his father, Wayne Harris, was an Air Force pilot. In Littleton, the 
family bought a two-story, $184,000 home on a quiet cul-de-sac. 
Wayne Harris got a job at a flight-safety business, and his wife, 
Katherine, worked for a catering company, according to court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said the couple were quiet, sometimes waving across  
the fence but making little effort to socialize. Eric's older 
brother, Kevin, played basketball with neighbors on trips home from 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were pretty nice people, pretty quiet,'' said Matt Good,  
16, who lives two doors away. ``They seemed to get along with 
everyone.''

<HEADLINE> D.C. Residents Avoid Downtown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The empty downtown streets spooked Janell  
Bragg. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really eerie,'' she said today, looking down Pennsylvania  
Avenue as she waited for a cup of coffee at a cart outside the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington residents who braced themselves for gridlock because  
of the NATO summit found just the opposite. Weeks of traffic-jam 
stories and warnings to stay home apparently scared most people 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a ghost town,'' said Alpheila Kerns as she walked to  
work. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she had ridden downtown on the Metro subway and got a  
seat -- a rarity during weekday rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm used to getting bumped three or four times or pushed flat  
against the door,'' she said. ``This morning, there were plenty of 
seats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police did block streets to allow motorcades to swiftly pass. At  
times, taxis, city buses and other vehicles plugged K Street in 
Washington's business district. But by 9:30 a.m., traffic flowed 
freely. 
</P>
<P>
	Many government workers had been told to stay home. Schools were  
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd think it was a Sunday,'' Bragg said.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the summit hall, there were a couple of technical  
glitches at the start. 
</P>
<P>
	As the opening session began and the world leaders took their  
seats, a cell phone rang. Secretary-General Javier Solana urgently 
scanned the room. ``Telephones out. Telephones out, please,'' he 
ordered. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after Solana invited President Clinton to make remarks,  
the president began to speak into a dead microphone. British Prime 
Minister Tony Blair, at Clinton's right elbow, moved to flip the 
microphone's ``on'' switch.

	Clinton, one of the few leaders wearing the summit's  
commemorative button on his lapel, sat behind a plaque identifying 
his alphabetically designated place at the circular table in French

<HEADLINE>  49ers Backup QB Faces Rape Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Jim Druckenmiller's already uncertain  
future with the San Francisco 49ers took a disturbing turn Friday 
when the backup quarterback was indicted on a rape charge. 
Druckenmiller denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge against Druckenmiller, a 1997 first-round pick out of  
Virginia Tech, comes at a time when his standing with the team is 
at a low. General manager Bill Walsh trashed his football skills 
two weeks ago and last week implied he would have been released by 
now but for salary cap ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller took part Friday in the opening of the team's  
three-day mini camp and coach Steve Mariucci said he would be 
permitted to continue practicing with the team while the criminal 
case goes through the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, he's still a member of this football team,''  
Mariucci said. ``He's going to be evaluated based on his 
performance on the football field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said Druckenmiller met with him Thursday to inform him  
about the criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've discussed it briefly,'' Mariucci said. ``Neither one of  
us can really say much of anything at all regarding this issue, but 
he explained his side to me and as you know there are two sides to 
every story. Hopefully, this will all be resolved soon. We'll let 
the legal system progress as it normally would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller is accused of assaulting a Virginia Tech student  
in early March when he returned to Blacksburg, Va., for a visit. 
The indictment was unsealed Friday by the order of a Montgomery 
County judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the team's workout, Druckenmiller declined to comment  
in any detail on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very confident I'll be available for this season,'' he  
said. ``I do believe justice will prevail. My teammates have been 
more than supportive. We've got a minicamp here and we're working 
on football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He referred other questions to his lawyer, David Neufeld, who in  
a statement described Druckenmiller as the victim in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Neufeld said Druckenmiller had been aggressively pursued by his  
accuser and claims the two later had consensual sex. He also said 
Druckenmiller took and passed a polygraph test. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the obvious anguish caused by the false charges, Jim  
is confident and finds some comfort in knowing that he will be 
fully vindicated,'' Neufeld said. '' ... He stands ready to 
vigorously defend his innocence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one-paragraph indictment provides no details of the crime,  
saying only that Druckenmiller had sex with the woman ``against her 
will, by force or through the use of physical helplessness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors declined to say whether alcohol was involved in the  
woman's condition of helplessness. Druckenmiller is not accused of 
using threats or intimidation to have sex with the woman. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of rape, Druckenmiller could face five years to  
life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Under NFL policy, any player charged with a violent crime is  
required to undergo immediate clinical evaluation and counseling. 
Conviction or admitting to a violent crime could bring suspension 
without pay by the league or a fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Druckenmiller said he wasn't aware of Walsh's recent  
criticism and insisted he had a good relationship with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh had mocked Druckenmiller's reputation as a strong-armed  
quarterback, saying touch and nimbleness in the pocket were more 
important in the 49ers' West Coast scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, after seeing a quarterback workout, Walsh  
described Druckenmiller's throwing as spotty and erratic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've stopped reading the media,'' Druckenmiller said. ``I just  
haven't been doing that and I haven't heard anything verbatim. I'd 
like to hear it myself. When me and Bill have talked, it's been 
very positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling good. I'm out there playing and competing. I think  
I've been throwing the ball well.''

<HEADLINE>  Officer's Report Praised Teen Gunmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Less than three months before their  
carefully planned attack on Columbine High schoolmates, Dylan 
Klebold and Eric Harris were impressing a juvenile-court officer as 
bright young men with ``a great deal of potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't the only one fooled: Neighbors and friends say they  
were reassured by the teens' middle-class backgrounds and quiet, 
``utterly normal'' family lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold, 17, and Harris, 18, were caught breaking into a van  
last year and entered a juvenile-court diversion program allowing 
them to clear their records. They finished the program in February, 
with flying colors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eric is a very bright young man who is likely to succeed in  
life. He is intelligent enough to achieve lofty goals as long as he 
stays on task and remains motivated,'' a diversion officer wrote in 
Jefferson County District Court documents released Thursday. The 
officer's name was blacked out by the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Klebold, the officer wrote: ``Dylan has earned the right for  
an early termination. ... He is intelligent enough to make any 
dream a reality but he needs to understand hard work is part of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each teen completed 45 hours of community service, received  
counseling and wrote an apology letter. Harris received additional 
counseling in anger management, which he enjoyed, the officer 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys came in and put their best face on,'' said District  
Attorney Dave Thomas, the diversion officer's boss. ``Most of us in 
the system wish we were human lie-detectors, but we're not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teens' middle-class upbringing also lulled adults into  
complacency -- even as some classmates grew alarmed at their bitter, 
vengeful tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
	At school, Klebold and Harris openly admired Hitler, hurled  
insults at minorities and conducted a running feud with the 
school's athletes. In the presence of adults, however, they were 
polite and friendly. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold lived in a home worth nearly $400,000, a modernistic  
cedar-and-glass structure tucked between two huge stone formations 
on a rural road. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Thomas Klebold, 52, is a former geophysicist who now  
runs a mortgage management business from his home. His mother, 
Susan, 50, has worked for the Colorado community-college system for 
years, helping disabled students gain access to education. 
</P>
<P>
	His maternal grandfather, the late Leo Yassenoff, was a  
prominent Jewish philanthropist in Columbus, Ohio, The Columbus 
Dispatch reported today. The Jewish Community Center of Columbus 
was named for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all scratching our heads right now,'' said Michael  
Briand, who knows Susan Klebold from his work as a 
community-development consultant at Arapahoe Community College. 
</P>
<P>
	Briand said Thomas Klebold is known as a liberal who favors gun  
control. Susan Klebold is a sensitive listener. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I can tell, this family was utterly, utterly  
normal,'' Briand said. ``They did everything right. But somehow the 
pain and anger was too deep, and they didn't see it or couldn't 
reach it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris moved to Littleton in 1996 from Plattsburgh, N.Y., where  
his father, Wayne Harris, was an Air Force pilot. In Littleton, the 
family bought a two-story, $184,000 home on a quiet cul-de-sac. 
Wayne Harris got a job at a flight-safety business, and his wife, 
Katherine, went to work for a catering company, according to the 
juvenile-court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors say Wayne and Katherine were quiet, sometimes waving  
across the fence while in the yard but making little effort to 
socialize. Eric's older brother, Kevin, played basketball with 
neighbors on trips home from college. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were pretty nice people, pretty quiet. They seemed to get  
along with everyone,'' said Matt Good, 16, who lives two doors 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Former neighbors in Plattsburgh remember the Harrises as a  
solid, middle-class family with a likable young son. They were 
shocked to learn that Eric Harris had shot up a school. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mouth just dropped,'' former classmate Kyle Ross said. ``He  
was a typical kid. He didn't seem anything like what is portrayed 
on TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The families were avoiding reporters, but both issued statements  
expressing sympathy for the victims, and Klebold's family wondered 
what went wrong: ``Like the rest of the country, we are struggling 
to understand why this happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Briand said Klebold's parents grew hopeful in recent months that  
their son was starting to lose his fascination with the black 
clothes and rebellious ways of ``Goth'' culture. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are also signs that Klebold's father suspected his son  
was still a threat to himself and others. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, amid TV reports of gunmen in trench coats rampaging  
through Columbine High, the elder Klebold contacted authorities, 
suspecting his son was involved and offering his help as a 
mediator. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said he was too late.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman have filed a  
libel suit against the Star for a story claiming they needed a sex 
therapist to perform love scenes in ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed Thursday against the supermarket tabloid.

	The March 30 story was headlined ``We had to teach Tom and

	Sex therapists Tony and Wendy Duffield were quoted as saying  
they were hired to teach the couple love scenes for the Stanley 
Kubrick movie, which opens this summer.

``unqualified as actors because of their inability to portray 
sufficiently realistic or amorous love scenes.''

<HEADLINE>  NATO Resolves To Continue Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Western leaders, celebrating NATO's 50th  
anniversary, pledged today to intensify their military fight 
against Yugoslavia and maintain it until their demands are met. 
``We will not allow this campaign of terror to succeed. NATO is 
determined to prevail,'' the alliance's 19 partners declared. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement, issued at the conclusion of a three-hour session  
that dealt exclusively with the crisis in Kosovo, said the bombing, 
now in its fifth week, would end if Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic ends his crackdown in the province and meets other NATO 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, at a ceremony commemorating the April 1949  
signing of the charter setting up the Cold War alliance that 
confronted Soviet power in Europe, described Milosevic's regime as 
``the last European dictatorship of the 20th century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The alliance will not have meaning in the 21st century if it  
permits the slaughter of innocents on its doorsteps,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can be no compromise on these conditions,'' the joint  
statement said. The demands include a withdrawal of Serbian forces 
from Kosovo, an armed international peacekeeping force and a 
settlement that would restore autonomy to ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Congress welcomed the leaders at a ceremony in the  
Capitol's Rotunda. ``Our alliance remains essential,'' said Senate 
Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. ``Ethnic cleansing 
is an affront to everything our nation and our alliance stands for. 
It must end now.'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., called the 
weekend summit ``a most wonderful celebration of democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement also called for an oil embargo against Yugoslavia  
-- although it did not specify how it would be carried out -- and 
said NATO would seek a U.N. Security Council resolution supporting 
demilitarization of Kosovo and an international peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-page statement did not mention the possibility of  
sending ground troops into the battle -- a subject on which alliance 
leaders are divided. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the military offensive  
against Belgrade shows ``values have meaning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solana welcomed into the alliance three former Warsaw Pact  
nations -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Poland's president, Aleksander Kwasniewski, told the gathering:  
``The dreams of our fathers and grandfathers have now come true. 
... The doors to NATO must stay open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Balkans crisis brings with NATO membership ``not only a  
feeling of comfort, it is also about shared responsibility,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders signed a commemorative copy of the 1949 treaty and  
statement of goals for the 21st century, each signing on the 
document alongside pictures of their national flags. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit brought 42 heads of government to town -- the 19 NATO  
leaders and leaders of 23 partner states. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking a U.N. Security Council resolution to force a settlement  
on Milosevic likely would set up a confrontation with Russia, which 
has veto power in the Security Council and opposes the bombing. The 
leaders said Russia has ``an important role to play in a search for 
a solution to the conflict in Kosovo'' and said they want to work 
constructively with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO announced it would enforce economic sanctions more  
forcefully -- and called for ``an embargo on petroleum products.'' 
It directed defense ministers to develop a way to keep seaborne oil 
from reaching Yugoslavia. The United States has proposed boarding 
and searching ships in the Adriatic suspected of supplying oil to 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is prepared to suspend its airstrikes once Belgrade has  
unequivocally accepted the ... conditions and demonstrably begun to 
withdraw its forces from Kosovo, according to precise and rapid 
timetable,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana later told a news conference that NATO defense ministers  
would ``look into all the possibilities for implementing the 
sanctions,'' including the embargo, in a way that did not adversely 
affect the already fragile economy of Montenegro, the only Yugoslav 
republic with a port. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Western leaders rejected a new diplomatic  
overture from Milosevic to end the bombing, NATO's first-ever 
military offensive against a sovereign nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The overture did not meet two key demands -- removal of  
Milosevic's forces from the Serbian province and emplacement of an 
armed international peacekeeping force, leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, suggested that Milosevic  
might agree to an armed force in Kosovo under certain 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	But Western leaders still rejected the overture. French  
President Jacques Chirac called it ``totally insufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic must know there is no place for his policies in  
Europe on the eve of the 21st century,'' Solana said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting under extraordinary security, with several blocks  
surrounding the ornate Reagan Building sealed off and helicopters 
hovering overhead, NATO leaders had been expected to debate the 
issue of ground troops at their meeting, although no decision had 
been expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme commander for Europe, told the  
closed-door gathering on Kosovo, ``We are winning. He (Milosevic) 
is losing. And he knows it,'' according to a U.S. official who was 
in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders' statement declares that NATO won't accept any  
threat against neighboring countries and expresses support for the 
government of Montenegro, Yugoslavia's smaller, pro-Western 
republic, saying any attempt to undermine that government would 
have grave consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as NATO leaders met, the air campaign against Yugoslavia  
continued without pause. The headquarters of Belgrade's main 
television network was hit, and NATO destroyed one of Milosevic's 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that damage continues,'' British Prime  
Minister Tony Blair said Friday morning on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton earlier bestowed his support on Solana's decision to  
have NATO military leaders update contingency plans for Yugoslavia, 
including one for a possible ground assault. The president called 
it ``a wise and prudent course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all NATO leaders were comfortable with the progress of the  
air war. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis earlier said prolonged  
bombing of Yugoslavia could turn his nation against NATO and the 
United States. ``The more the war continues, the more difficult the 
problems will be,'' Simitis. But at the ceremony, Smitis stayed 
away from the subject, saying NATO should aim to work for ``secure 
cooperation, peace and prosperity.''

<HEADLINE> Oregon Bans Private Hunting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Oregon on Friday banned ``canned  
hunting,'' the practice of keeping exotic animals in a fenced 
compound and charging hunters to come in and stalk them. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-member Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission voted  
unanimously to end the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The only known place in Oregon to offer canned hunting is the  
3,500-acre Clover Creek Ranch in the Ochoco Mountains. There, 
hunters have paid to bag such prey as Russian boar, Hawaiian black 
sheep and Israeli ibex goats. 
</P>
<P>
	The ranch's owner, Clark Couch, had argued that the ban would  
put him out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	Several states have already banned, or are considering a ban, on  
canned hunts. The practice has thrived in other places, including 
Texas, where exotic game farms draw high-paying customers for 
private ``safaris.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such hunts drew widespread attention in Oregon in 1994, when a  
Klamath Falls-area landowner allowed an African lion to be shot in 
a corral. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon law already prohibits the hunting of native game animals  
within enclosures, but there was no such protection for exotic 
species. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Clover Creek Ranch, prices on hunting the 16 species  
offered range from $300 for an angora goat up to $2,000 for a 
trophy buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch said that because of the steep canyons on his property,  
the animals are not easy prey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Humane Society of the United States has been one of the  
harshest critics of the ranch. It is also leading a campaign 
against the nation's 1,200 private safari game ranches.

	``The alliance will not have meaning in the 21st century if it  
permits the slaughter of innocents on its doorsteps,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can be no compromise on these conditions,'' the joint  
statement said. The demands include a withdrawal of Serbian forces 
from Kosovo, an armed international peacekeeping force and a 
settlement that would restore autonomy to ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Congress welcomed the leaders at a ceremony in the  
Capitol's Rotunda. ``Our alliance remains essential,'' said Senate 
Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. ``Ethnic cleansing 
is an affront to everything our nation and our alliance stands for. 
It must end now.'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., called the 
weekend summit ``a most wonderful celebration of democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement also called for an oil embargo against Yugoslavia  
-- although it did not specify how it would be carried out -- and 
said NATO would seek a U.N. Security Council resolution supporting 
demilitarization of Kosovo and an international peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-page statement did not mention the possibility of  
sending ground troops into the battle -- a subject on which alliance 
leaders are divided. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the military offensive  
against Belgrade shows ``values have meaning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solana welcomed into the alliance three former Warsaw Pact  
nations -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Poland's president, Aleksander Kwasniewski, told the gathering:  
``The dreams of our fathers and grandfathers have now come true. 
... The doors to NATO must stay open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Balkans crisis brings with NATO membership ``not only a  
feeling of comfort, it is also about shared responsibility,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders signed a commemorative copy of the 1949 treaty and  
statement of goals for the 21st century, each signing on the 
document alongside pictures of their national flags. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit brought 42 heads of government to town -- the 19 NATO  
leaders and leaders of 23 partner states. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking a U.N. Security Council resolution to force a settlement  
on Milosevic likely would set up a confrontation with Russia, which 
has veto power in the Security Council and opposes the bombing. The 
leaders said Russia has ``an important role to play in a search for 
a solution to the conflict in Kosovo'' and said they want to work 
constructively with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO announced it would enforce economic sanctions more  
forcefully -- and called for ``an embargo on petroleum products.'' 
It directed defense ministers to develop a way to keep seaborne oil 
from reaching Yugoslavia. The United States has proposed boarding 
and searching ships in the Adriatic suspected of supplying oil to 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is prepared to suspend its airstrikes once Belgrade has  
unequivocally accepted the ... conditions and demonstrably begun to 
withdraw its forces from Kosovo, according to precise and rapid 
timetable,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana later told a news conference that NATO defense ministers  
would ``look into all the possibilities for implementing the 
sanctions,'' including the embargo, in a way that did not adversely 
affect the already fragile economy of Montenegro, the only Yugoslav 
republic with a port. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Western leaders rejected a new diplomatic  
overture from Milosevic to end the bombing, NATO's first-ever 
military offensive against a sovereign nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The overture did not meet two key demands -- removal of  
Milosevic's forces from the Serbian province and emplacement of an 
armed international peacekeeping force, leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, suggested that Milosevic  
might agree to an armed force in Kosovo under certain 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	But Western leaders still rejected the overture. French  
President Jacques Chirac called it ``totally insufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic must know there is no place for his policies in  
Europe on the eve of the 21st century,'' Solana said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting under extraordinary security, with several blocks  
surrounding the ornate Reagan Building sealed off and helicopters 
hovering overhead, NATO leaders had been expected to debate the 
issue of ground troops at their meeting, although no decision had 
been expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme commander for Europe, told the  
closed-door gathering on Kosovo, ``We are winning. He (Milosevic) 
is losing. And he knows it,'' according to a U.S. official who was 
in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders' statement declares that NATO won't accept any  
threat against neighboring countries and expresses support for the 
government of Montenegro, Yugoslavia's smaller, pro-Western 
republic, saying any attempt to undermine that government would 
have grave consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as NATO leaders met, the air campaign against Yugoslavia  
continued without pause. The headquarters of Belgrade's main 
television network was hit, and NATO destroyed one of Milosevic's 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that damage continues,'' British Prime  
Minister Tony Blair said Friday morning on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton earlier bestowed his support on Solana's decision to  
have NATO military leaders update contingency plans for Yugoslavia, 
including one for a possible ground assault. The president called 
it ``a wise and prudent course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all NATO leaders were comfortable with the progress of the  
air war. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis earlier said prolonged  
bombing of Yugoslavia could turn his nation against NATO and the 
United States. ``The more the war continues, the more difficult the 
problems will be,'' Simitis. But at the ceremony, Smitis stayed 
away from the subject, saying NATO should aim to work for ``secure 
cooperation, peace and prosperity.''

<HEADLINE> Lonesome Glory Wins Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Four-time steeplechase champion Lonesome  
Glory overtook the pacesetters at the final hurdle and won the 
$175,000 Grade I Royal Chase for the Sport of Kings Friday as 
Keeneland ended its 15-day spring meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-year-old Lonesome Glory rallied at the turn to catch  
Romantic and then held off Dalton River for his 24th lifetime 
victory, 19 over jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	Two lengths separated Lonesome Glory and Dalton River at the  
finish of the 2 1/2-mile race over 13 hurdles in 4:36. It was a neck 
back to third-place Master McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
	Lonesome Glory is owned by Mrs. Walter M. Jeffords Jr. of New  
York and trained by Bruce Miller, father of the jockey. The son of 
Transworld earned Eclipse Awards as North America's leading 
steeplechaser in 1992, 1993, 1995 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner earned $105,000, increasing his career earnings to  
$1,318,068, a record for a North American-based steeplechase horse. 
Lonesome Glory paid $3.60, $2.80 and $2.40. Dalton River returned 
$4.20 and $3. Master McGrath paid $3.20. 
</P>
<P>
	In the co-featured Grade III Ben Ali Stakes, Jazz Club caught  
early leader Smile Again with an eighth of a mile to go and drew 
away to a 2 1/2-length victory under jockey Pat Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Smile Again, with Jerry Bailey aboard, held on for second,  
three-quarters of a length in front of third-place Early Warning in 
the field of six 4-year-olds and upward. 
</P>
<P>
	Jazz Club ran the 1 1/8 miles in 1:48 on the fast track and paid  
$5.40, $3.20 and $2.40 as the 17-10 favorite. It was his sixth win 
in 13 career starts, and he increased his lifetime earnings to 
$201,410 with the winner's purse of $67,456. 
</P>
<P>
	Smile Again returned $4.20 and $2.80, and Early Warning paid  
$2.60.

<HEADLINE> Company To Pay for Stealing Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Perdue Farms Inc. was ordered to pay an  
entrepreneur nearly $49 million for stealing his cook-in-a-bag 
method of roasting chicken. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to a jury award of $27 million in compensatory  
damages, a judge Thursday ordered Perdue to pay $6.75 million in 
punitive damages and $15 million in interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Perdue, based in Salisbury, Md., said it will appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	Dennis P. Hook, president of H&AMP;N Foods Inc., sued Perdue in  
1997, contending the chicken giant developed its TenderReady 
chicken based on his idea. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 9, the jury awarded Hook $27 million in lost income and  
royalties and decided Perdue should be punished for malicious 
actions. Circuit Judge Robert H. Bonanno decided how much Hook 
should get in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Hook's method of preparation was similar to boil-in-the-bag  
vegetables. A fully cooked chicken could be frozen up to a year and 
heated quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Hook reached an agreement with Pizza Hut in the early 1990s to  
market his cook-in-a-bag roasted chicken. Pizza Hut, in turn, 
contacted Perdue about supplying the chickens. Hook's deal with 
Pizza Hut eventually fell through, but Hook said Perdue stole his 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Hook said he was at a trade show in Paris when he stopped by a  
Perdue booth and saw a brochure touting TenderReady. 
</P>
<P>
	Perdue said it did not think it violated a confidentiality  
agreement in developing its own cook-in-the-bag method. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge did not immediately rule on Hook's request to stop  
Perdue's marketing of TenderReady. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes magazine has estimated Perdue's annual revenue at $2.2  
billion.

	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The Norwegian central bank cut interest  
rates Friday for the third time this year and said more cuts are 
likely as worries about an overheating economy cool off. 
</P>
<P>
	Norges Bank made a half-point cut in its overnight lending rate  
to other banks to 8.5 percent, citing a gradual slowing of economic 
growth.

<HEADLINE>  Hyundai To Pare Number of Divisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Hyundai Group, Korea's biggest  
conglomerate, plans to reduce the number of its subsidiaries 
drastically over the next four years and eventually plans to divide 
itself into five key businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has been encouraging the nation's biggest  
companies to focus on key businesses and shed peripheral operations 
to become more efficient and regain foreign investors' confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai said Friday it would reduce the number of its  
subsidiaries to 26 from 79 by 2003 through sales and mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai officials said the conglomerate will eventually be  
broken into five groups to handle each of the core businesses -- 
automobiles, shipbuilding, construction-engineering, electronics 
and finance. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo, the nation's second largest conglomerate, unveiled plans  
earlier this week to sell its shipbuilding and 25 other 
subsidiaries by October to improve its financial position and focus 
on carmaking and finance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The restructuring will completely change the face of  
Hyundai,'' Park Se-yong, head of the group's corporate 
restructuring committee, told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Also announced at the news conference was the conclusion of a  
deal that allows Hyundai to buy a computer memory chip-making arm 
of LG group for $2.13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, wrapped up late Thursday after months of negotiations,  
calls for Hyundai to pay LG Semicon $1.3 billion immediately and 
the remainder in five installments by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition will make Hyundai Electronics Co. the world's  
largest memory chip producer with an estimated 20.8 percent share 
of the world market. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai officials said the restructuring aims to reduce their  
group's total debt to $2.7 billion from $6.5 billion by the end of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of Hyundai subsidiaries to be sold, spun off or merged  
includes several profitable steel making, petrochemical and 
aluminum plants as well as smaller plants. 
</P>
<P>
	As in the case of Daewoo, Hyundai's plan drew applause from the  
government but skepticism from economists and analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts expressed doubt that Hyundai will be able to find  
buyers for its assets. They noted that most past promises by the 
nation's top conglomerates went unfulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of restructuring by Hyundai and Daewoo came  
days after President Kim Dae-jung urged vigorous corporate 
restructuring to improve efficiency and boost foreign investors' 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has focused his criticism on the country's top  
five conglomerates -- Daewoo, Hyundai, Samsung, LG and SK -- each of 
which controls 40 to 70 subsidiaries, making everything from 
computer chips to cars and ships. 
</P>
<P>
	When the economy slowed in 1996-1997, about a dozen  
conglomerates collapsed under their debt load, leaving banks with 
mounds of non-performing loans that caused a sudden loss of 
confidence and triggered a flight of foreign capital. 
</P>
<P>
	That forced South Korea to accept a record $58 billion bailout  
from the International Monetary Fund in late 1997. Structural 
economic reforms were a key condition of the rescue package. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Korean economy shrank 5.8 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Shootings Indicate Bigger Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four out of five Americans expect more  
shootings like the attacks at a Colorado high school to occur 
elsewhere in the country over the next year or so, says a new poll. 
</P>
<P>
	In another poll, about that many said high school shootings are  
a sign something is seriously wrong in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll taken this week indicated 79 percent  
believe Tuesday's shootings in Littleton, Colo., that left 15 dead 
-- including the two assailants -- are a sign of serious national 
problems rather than isolated incidents. And 80 percent in a CBS 
poll said they expect more shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	People placed a ``great deal'' of the blame for the shootings on  
the ready availability of guns; followed by parents; TV programs, 
movies and music; and social pressures on youth, in the CNN/USA 
Today/Gallup poll. Media coverage of similar incidents, the 
Internet and schools got the least blame. 
</P>
<P>
	The steps identified in that poll as most effective to stop high  
school violence were imposing stricter gun controls on teen-agers, 
placing tougher regulation on television and movie violence, 
putting metal detectors in schools, increasing counseling for 
teen-agers and restricting what's available to teens on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-fourths in a poll by Fox News/Opinion Dynamics said teens  
who kill teens should face the possibility of the death penalty, 
and half said parents of teens who kill other teens should face 
some legal responsibility for their children's actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The CNN/USA Today/Gallup telephone poll of 659 adults was taken  
Wednesday and has an error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage 
points. The Fox News telephone poll of 942 adults taken Wednesday 
and Thursday has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points. The CBS poll of 450 people taken Thursday has an error 
margin of plus or minus 5 percentage points.

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Investigators said today tapes from the  
security cameras at Columbine High may show whether the two teen 
gunmen who died in the school bloodbath had accomplices. Gov. Bill 
Owens, who toured the school, said it was all but certain that the 
pair had help. Investigators were interviewing surviving members of 
the Trenchcoat Mafia. Officials also were trying to trace the 
weapons the two teen-agers used to kill 13 people and then 
themselves. Meanwhile, hundreds attended the first memorial service

Yugoslavia until its repression in Kosovo ends. ``We will not allow 
this campaign of terror to succeed,'' the 19 leaders declared in a

requested that federal funds be made available to the counties 
because the fires that have burned more than 240,000 acres this

<HEADLINE> Diamond Device Plays Illegal Tunes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- In a partial concession to the recording  
industry, the developer of a Walkman-style device that can play 
bootlegged music downloaded from the Internet has decided to allow 
copyright protection in its newest devices. 
</P>
<P>
	In a deal to be announced Monday Diamond Multimedia will promise  
to design future versions of its Rio music players to play 
copyright-protected music, however the new devices will still be 
able to play the illegal music files now proliferating on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes as record labels are preparing a unified  
technology standard for selling music online under terms they can 
control -- and profit from. The labels are trying to fight off the 
illegal music that has been created in a digital format called MP3 
which allows for fast transfer of audio files over the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology used by Diamond would allow consumers to download  
copyrighted audio files for a fee and listen to them for just a 
week or a month before they become unplayable. Or they could pay a 
higher price for permanent purchase agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers will have access to far greater content from  
well-known artists,'' said Lorraine Comstock, director of marketing 
for RioPort, a division of Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
	Diamond isn't totally caving in to the Recording Industry  
Association of America, which went to court last year in an 
unsuccessful attempt to halt sales of Rio players. Future versions 
will still be able to play uncopyrighted files. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the recording industry association declined  
comment Friday on Diamond's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	To develop the copyright protection method, Diamond is working  
with a company called InterTrust Technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	Intertrust markets digital rights management technology, which  
can track the use of the audio content from providers to listeners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our software packages the content, travels with the content,  
provides the rules, makes sure that the privacy of the consumer is 
protected and handles payment over the Internet,'' said InterTrust 
spokesman Joseph Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rio music player carries about an hour's worth of CD-quality  
music in the MP3 format on a computer chip. Current versions sell 
for $199. 
</P>
<P>
	Diamond said the new designs should be available by Christmas.

<HEADLINE> Cell Phones Are Lifeline in Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- One student used a cellular phone to deliver a  
calming message to his mother: ``I'm OK, but I'm hiding.'' Thirty 
others, huddling in the choir room, telephoned to let authorities 
know where they were. 
</P>
<P>
	Others outside Columbine High School used cell phones to tell  
their parents they were OK. And anxious parents, who nervously 
paced outside a nearby park in Littleton, were able to contact 
their missing children. 
</P>
<P>
	An increasingly popular -- some would say annoying -- accouterment  
of a mobile society, cell phones served as a lifeline for some 
during and after Tuesday's rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Although calls to Denver-area cell phone retailers showed no  
widespread run on the devices, several reported dramatically 
increased sales since the tragedy. A number of parents said they 
wanted their children to have them. 
</P>
<P>
	At the height of the rampage, Belita Bennett paged her two sons,  
Joseph and Steven Dreaden. Joe was outside the school and Steven 
was inside, and they borrowed cell phones to call her back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe was crying and said, `Mommy, I'm scared,''' she said.  
``Then Steve got on the phone and said, `It's cool, Mom. We're OK.' 
I just started crying. I talked to them on and off throughout the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I normally don't like cell phones, but they were a miracle  
worker that day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two Columbine freshmen, Eric Sunde and Jamie Amo, said they  
don't have cell phones but now want them. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it weren't for all the cell phones, people wouldn't have  
known what was going on,'' Sunde said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some school districts outlaw the devices, along with pagers,  
believing they create a distraction in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Jefferson County schools spokeswoman Marilyn Saltzman  
said many parents are getting their children cell phones to stay in 
touch. ``It's a fairly new phenomenon,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a mother in here right now buying a phone for her  
kid,'' Jake Sigmund, owner of Advantage Wireless Southwest, said 
Thursday. His store is about a mile from the Littleton high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since Wednesday, our sales have jumped quite a bit,'' he said.  
``A lady next door who works for a hair salon has been asking about 
getting one for her son. I've had six people in the store who 
normally wouldn't be in here. Some of them say it's because of the 
tragedy. Others, you can just tell by the way they're acting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Martinez of Littleton, whose daughter attends a high school  
in Jefferson County that he declined to identify, said, ``I plan to 
send her back to school on Monday with a cell phone. I didn't think 
I would ever say that. But I don't want to spend hours of anguish 
wondering if my child is safe.''

<HEADLINE> Hearing Resumes on Slaney Drug Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Mary Slaney's drug case is entering  
its final lap. 
</P>
<P>
	After a three-month delay, track and field's governing body on  
Saturday reopens an arbitration hearing into the distance runner's 
positive testosterone test in the 1996 U.S. Olympic trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney's lawyers last week filed suit in Indianapolis against  
the International Amateur Athletics Federation and the U.S. Olympic 
Committee, which administered the test. 
</P>
<P>
	But the IAAF, based here, insists the hearing will go on.  
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue the hearing but no one from the Slaney side  
or U.S. federation will be represented,'' IAAF spokesman Giorgio 
Reineri said Friday. ``The IAAF wants to hear Slaney's side but we 
must carry on because an American court cannot have jurisdiction 
over the IAAF.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri said no other hearing in recent history had been  
conducted without the athlete present. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, USA Track &AMP; Field and Slaney said they  
would let the hearings continue without their involvement as an 
``appropriate forum in which to raise the issue in her case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF suspended Slaney -- the 1983 world champion at 1,500 and  
3,000 meters and considered the greatest U.S. women's distance 
runner in history -- in May 1997, claiming that USA Track and Field 
was dragging its feet investigating the runner's drug test. 
</P>
<P>
	USATF imposed its own suspension. But Slaney challenged the  
ruling, and in September 1997 the U.S. federation cleared her. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the IAAF also cleared Slaney to compete, it refused to  
accept the USATF ruling and referred the case to arbitration. That 
panel convened in January but was postponed after both sides said 
they needed more time to collect evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	This hearing should last one or two days.  
</P>
<P>
	The case centers on the T-E ratio, the test used by most sports  
to detect the presence of testosterone, a naturally occurring 
muscle-building hormone that is also taken in concentrated form to 
improve performance. 
</P>
<P>
	A ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone should normally be  
about 1-1, but Slaney's original sample was reportedly higher than 
the 6-1 ratio that triggers a formal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney, 40, says recent research shows that the T-E test is  
unreliable for women who are taking the birth control pill in their 
late 30s or 40s, an argument rejected by the IAAF. 
</P>
<P>
	``Slaney is faced with the insurmountable burden of having to  
prove that one of these factors, or some other innocent factor, in 
fact caused her elevated ration,'' the USATF said in a release. 
``USATF believes that placing such a burden on an athlete is 
indefensible, both as a matter of science and as a matter of 
fundamental fairness.''

<HEADLINE> Witness in Microsoft Case Surprised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Experts following the Microsoft antitrust  
trial weren't the only ones surprised when the government initially 
chose as one of its witnesses a relatively unknown software 
engineer from Boeing Co. 
</P>
<P>
	New testimony released Thursday shows that the engineer himself  
was surprised to learn of his role in one of the most important 
business trials in a century. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Vesey said he realized he was on the witness list only  
after reading his name on the front page of his newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's lawyer, Tom Burt, apparently was so caught off-guard  
by the disclosure that he did a double-take during his interview of 
Vesey. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the day that the witness lists were published in the paper  
on a Saturday, did you say?'' Burt asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah,'' offered Vesey, who added that he spoke just twice  
weeks earlier by telephone to lawyers from the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Vesey's interview, from last September, was the first to be  
released from more than 90 interviews conducted for the trial. The 
others, including three days of interviews with Microsoft Chairman 
Bill Gates, were expected to be made public by the middle of next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court ruled earlier this year that an obscure  
1913 law allows the public to read the transcripts from those 
depositions, from some of the high-tech industry's most powerful 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling also ensured that the public can attend any future  
interviews with executives related to the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of those was scheduled for Wednesday in Washington,  
when Microsoft lawyers will question Netscape executive Peter 
Currie. America Online, the world's largest Internet provider, said 
it expects its chairman, Steve Case, to be questioned the first 
week of May. 
</P>
<P>
	Vesey, who decides which Internet software that most Boeing  
employees use, never actually testified at the Microsoft trial, 
despite originally being selected as a witness. The trial is 
currently in a lengthy recess but expected to resume in mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department, a month after it chose Vesey, replaced  
him and another witness, an economics expert, with executives from 
Apple Computer Co. and Sun Microsystems Inc. The government did 
show brief video excerpts during the trial of Vesey explaining why 
Boeing chose to use Netscape's browser, not Microsoft's. 
</P>
<P>
	Under rules to speed the trial, the judge limited the government  
and Microsoft to only a dozen witnesses each. That meant each 
choice carried important implications. 
</P>
<P>
	But the full transcript of Vesey's interview suggests why the  
government originally believed he might be a compelling witness 
against the software giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Vesey told lawyers, for example, that Boeing estimated a $5  
million savings by choosing to install a newer version of 
Netscape's software rather than also distributing Microsoft's rival 
Web software on its 170,000 personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	One core issue at the trial is whether Microsoft illegally  
forces customers of its dominant Windows operating system to use 
its Internet software, which is included within the most recent 
versions of Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges Microsoft ``tied'' the products in  
violation of federal antitrust law, discouraging consumers from 
using a rival's software that might perform redundant functions. 
Microsoft said it integrated Internet features into Windows to 
benefit customers.

<HEADLINE>  Officer's Report Praised Teen Gunmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Less than three months before their  
carefully planned attack on Columbine High schoolmates, Dylan 
Klebold and Eric Harris were impressing a juvenile-court officer as 
bright young men with ``a great deal of potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't the only one fooled: Neighbors and friends say they  
were reassured by the teens' middle-class backgrounds and quiet, 
``utterly normal'' family lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold, 17, and Harris, 18, were caught breaking into a van  
last year and entered a juvenile-court diversion program allowing 
them to clear their records. They finished the program in February, 
with flying colors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eric is a very bright young man who is likely to succeed in  
life. He is intelligent enough to achieve lofty goals as long as he 
stays on task and remains motivated,'' a diversion officer wrote in 
Jefferson County District Court documents released Thursday. The 
officer's name was blacked out by the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Klebold, the officer wrote: ``Dylan has earned the right for  
an early termination. ... He is intelligent enough to make any 
dream a reality but he needs to understand hard work is part of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each teen completed 45 hours of community service, received  
counseling and wrote an apology letter. Harris received additional 
counseling in anger management, which he enjoyed, the officer 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys came in and put their best face on,'' said District  
Attorney Dave Thomas, the diversion officer's boss. ``Most of us in 
the system wish we were human lie-detectors, but we're not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teens' middle-class upbringing also lulled adults into  
complacency -- even as some classmates grew alarmed at their bitter, 
vengeful tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
	At school, Klebold and Harris openly admired Hitler, hurled  
insults at minorities and conducted a running feud with the 
school's athletes. In the presence of adults, however, they were 
polite and friendly. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold lived in a home worth nearly $400,000, a modernistic  
cedar-and-glass structure tucked between two huge stone formations 
on a rural road. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Thomas Klebold, 52, is a former geophysicist who now  
runs a mortgage management business from his home. His mother, 
Susan, 50, has worked for the Colorado community-college system for 
years, helping disabled students gain access to education. 
</P>
<P>
	His maternal grandfather, the late Leo Yassenoff, was a  
prominent Jewish philanthropist in Columbus, Ohio, The Columbus 
Dispatch reported today. The Jewish Community Center of Columbus 
was named for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all scratching our heads right now,'' said Michael  
Briand, who knows Susan Klebold from his work as a 
community-development consultant at Arapahoe Community College. 
</P>
<P>
	Briand said Thomas Klebold is known as a liberal who favors gun  
control. Susan Klebold is a sensitive listener. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I can tell, this family was utterly, utterly  
normal,'' Briand said. ``They did everything right. But somehow the 
pain and anger was too deep, and they didn't see it or couldn't 
reach it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris moved to Littleton in 1996 from Plattsburgh, N.Y., where  
his father, Wayne Harris, was an Air Force pilot. In Littleton, the 
family bought a two-story, $184,000 home on a quiet cul-de-sac. 
Wayne Harris got a job at a flight-safety business, and his wife, 
Katherine, went to work for a catering company, according to the 
juvenile-court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors say Wayne and Katherine were quiet, sometimes waving  
across the fence while in the yard but making little effort to 
socialize. Eric's older brother, Kevin, played basketball with 
neighbors on trips home from college. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were pretty nice people, pretty quiet. They seemed to get  
along with everyone,'' said Matt Good, 16, who lives two doors 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Former neighbors in Plattsburgh remember the Harrises as a  
solid, middle-class family with a likable young son. They were 
shocked to learn that Eric Harris had shot up a school. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mouth just dropped,'' former classmate Kyle Ross said. ``He  
was a typical kid. He didn't seem anything like what is portrayed 
on TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The families were avoiding reporters, but both issued statements  
expressing sympathy for the victims, and Klebold's family wondered 
what went wrong: ``Like the rest of the country, we are struggling 
to understand why this happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Briand said Klebold's parents grew hopeful in recent months that  
their son was starting to lose his fascination with the black 
clothes and rebellious ways of ``Goth'' culture. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are also signs that Klebold's father suspected his son  
was still a threat to himself and others. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, amid TV reports of gunmen in trench coats rampaging  
through Columbine High, the elder Klebold contacted authorities, 
suspecting his son was involved and offering his help as a 
mediator. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said he was too late.

<HEADLINE> Human Ancestor Possibly Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The long list of human ancestors has a new  
member, the earliest known tool user who was carving meat with 
sharp stones 2.5 million years ago in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	So unexpected was the discovery of a skull and bones that  
researchers have named the ancestor ``garhi,'' meaning ``surprise'' 
in the local language of Ethiopia's Afar desert. 
</P>
<P>
	A descendent of the species that produced the famous Lucy  
skeleton in east Africa, the new hominid is a candidate for 
earliest human ancestor, the researchers say in an article in 
today's issue of the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthropologist Tim White of the University of California at  
Berkeley said the new species ``could turn out to be the link'' 
between the genus Homo, which includes modern humans -- Homo sapiens 
-- and its predecessor, Australopithecus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is in the right place, at the right time, to be the  
ancestor of early (humans), however defined,'' reported the team 
led by Berhane Asfaw of Rift Valley Research Service in Addis 
Ababa, Ethiopia, and White. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so sure, however, is anthropologist Bernard Wood of George  
Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's always good news when people find more fossil  
evidence,'' he said in a telephone interview, ``but ... I don't 
think we can be sure it's an ancestor of later'' humans. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they've found is what many of us were expecting, that  
there is quite a lot of variety in early hominids ... in this 
particular period,'' Wood said. ``I think it's ironic in some ways 
that it's been called a surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new species has been tentatively named Australopithecus  
garhi. It has large teeth and a projecting face, somewhat similar 
to the well-known fossil Lucy, who lived 3.2 million years ago and 
was of the Australopithecus afarensis species, with apelike upper 
arms that were long relative to her legs. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the more human-like Homo erectus developed, about  
1.7 million years ago, legs were longer and more human, and 
forearms had shortened. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the relationship between arm and leg bones from a  
second individual found near the new skull, garhi was between the 
two, with long, human-like legs but not yet having shortened 
forearms. 
</P>
<P>
	The skull was from a male, with a small brain case and a  
protruding jaw. The individual whose arm and leg bones were found 
would have been about 4-feet-10, White said. 
</P>
<P>
	An antelope jaw and other animal bones found near the garhi  
skeleton show cut marks from tools, perhaps the earliest evidence 
of human tool use in butchering animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden this is a bipedal primate with a difference,''  
White said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have the clearest evidence these very early hominids  
were butchering mammals and were knowledgeable about the ... 
(marrow) within the bones, a highly valuable food resource,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	The presence of the tools and the bones together ``doesn't prove  
that the individual was the one who held the stone tool, but it's 
pretty strong evidence,'' he went on. 
</P>
<P>
	The marks show the flesh was cut from the bones and the bones  
were broken at both ends, indicating an effort to extract the 
marrow, an important new food for hominids, according to a second 
paper by a team led by White, the late Jean de Heinzelin of the 
Royal Belgian Institute of Science and J. Desmond Clark, also at 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently a desert, 2.5 million years ago the region where the  
bones were found was a broad, shallow lake surrounded by grassland, 
the scientists reported. It was not clear, however, whether garhi 
hunted the animals that came to the lake or merely took advantage 
of dead animals found there.

<HEADLINE>  Orioles' Manager on Hot Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles have the third-highest  
payroll in baseball. They also have the worst ERA in the majors 
and, most significantly, the worst record. 
</P>
<P>
	If things don't change in a hurry, they may soon have a new  
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	It's hard to blame Ray Miller for the team's 6.73 ERA or the  
fact that Baltimore has stranded an average of nine runners per 
game, most in the majors. Truth is, Miller is probably taking the 
losing harder than anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the fans are not happy but there's no one in the world  
who's less happy than I am right now,'' he said Friday before the 
Orioles were to open a 12-game homestand against the Oakland 
Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bad about the situation, but I'm going to stand behind  
this team. We have plenty enough talent to win,'' Miller insisted. 
``We've all been pressing a little bit. I think if we can get it 
straightened out here, everyone will start feeling all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-12 start is second-worst in franchise history behind the  
0-21 start of the 1988 team. Manager Cal Ripken Sr. was fired six 
games into that season, and his ouster didn't prevent Baltimore 
from losing 107 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's right for the manager to take the heat,''  
catcher Lenny Webster said. ``I truly believe a manager is as good 
as his players. We're not playing good, so we're not making Ray 
look good. We reel off a good winning streak and Ray is going to 
look like a genius.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles went 79-83 under Miller last year, and at this rate  
won't even match that record despite a $78.5 million payroll that 
is exceeded only by the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	After going 1-8 on their recent road trip, the Orioles hope to  
turn things around during a homestand against four teams that 
failed to finish above .500 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You start all over today,'' said first baseman Will Clark, who  
is on the disabled list with a broken thumb. ``You can't dwell on 
what's happened in the past and you can't sit here and feel sorry 
for yourself. You have to come out fighting today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, Cal Ripken and Scott Kamieniecki are all on the disabled  
list, which isn't helping matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless, the Orioles have had difficulty getting their  
pitching and hitting working in unison. They scored at least six 
runs on five occasions but won only two of those games; they 
allowed only four hits Thursday night but got only one hit 
themselves in a 1-0 loss to Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're in a bad stretch everything is magnified,'' second  
baseman Jeff Reboulet said. ``Right now it's one thing or another. 
Nothing seems to be going right. But we've got a lot of time to 
catch up. It's too early to give up on the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller isn't giving up either, even though dozens of callers on  
local talk shows have been demanding his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry about anybody second-guessing me,'' Miller said.  
``I'm just going to try and do my job as best I can.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Western leaders transformed a 50th anniversary  
celebration of NATO into a somber war council Friday, pledging to 
intensify military strikes against Yugoslavia and vowing ``no 
compromise'' on demands that Slobodan Milosevic withdraw his troops 
from Kosovo. ``When we fight, we fight to prevail,'' President 
Clinton declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Without dissent, presidents and prime ministers of 19 nations  
pledged that the 1.4 million ethnic Albanian refugees forced from 
their homes will be able to return to ``live in peace and 
security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not allow this campaign of terror to succeed,'' the  
leaders asserted. ``NATO is determined to prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a flag-bedecked, columned auditorium -- the same place where  
NATO was born on April 4, 1949 -- the heads of state and government 
walked to a podium to sign the Washington declaration, a ``vision 
statement'' of the challenges awaiting NATO in the next century. It 
said the alliance will have to confront terrorism and the spread of 
weapons of mass destruction even as it fulfills its original 
mandate for collective defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo hung in the air, dampening the celebratory spirit.  
</P>
<P>
	``This alliance, which was forged in adversity, is today  
confronted with a new challenge in Kosovo, and I know it will 
overcome this challenge with success,'' French President Jacques 
Chirac said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the leaders kicked off the summit, U.S. diplomats at the  
United Nations began drafting a Security Council resolution calling 
for the demilitarization of Kosovo and an international military 
force to safeguard refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	A summit statement on Kosovo made no mention of the possibility  
of sending in ground troops -- a subject on which alliance leaders 
are divided. A U.S. official said the matter came up briefly in a 
few presentations but there was a general sense the air campaign 
was working. Even so, they endorsed updating NATO's assessment of a 
ground invasion and letting the public know that all options were 
being studied. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement also pledged to intensify economic sanctions and  
welcomed an oil embargo imposed by the European Union. But it did 
not embrace a naval blockade proposed by the United States to keep 
oil shipments away. 
</P>
<P>
	France and other governments questioned the legality of  
intercepting tankers at sea without a formal war declaration, a 
U.S. official said. Several allies favored extending the air 
campaign to bombing oil-truck convoys driving into Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders directed their defense ministers to determine how  
NATO could halt the delivery of war material -- including by 
launching ``maritime operations.'' Sandy Berger, Clinton's national 
security adviser, said there was a mandate to develop an 
interdiction system. But American officials were not optimistic 
about reaching an agreement by the summit's end Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme commander for Europe, flew in  
from Brussels, Belgium, and briefed the leaders on the 31-day 
bombing campaign against Milosevic. ``We're winning. He's losing. 
And he knows it,'' Clark said. NATO kept pounding Yugoslavia as the 
summit opened, striking Serbia state television and knocking it off 
the air for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis, a critic of NATO's policy  
toward Yugoslavia, said that using ground forces would aggravate 
tensions rather than ease them. And he said he told Clinton that 
prolonging the air campaign would make it more difficult to bring 
about peace. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit welcomed three new member nations that had been ruled  
by Moscow during the Cold War: Poland, Hungary and the Czech 
Republic. ``The dreams of our fathers and grandfathers have now 
come true. ... The doors to NATO must stay open,'' said Poland's 
president, Aleksander Kwasniewski. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit stretched from a three-hour morning meeting in the  
sprawling Ronald Reagan building -- second in size only to the 
Pentagon -- to a White House dinner in the chandeliered East Room. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will look back on this summit, I think, and say it wasn't  
one of those traditional meetings, where we got to say we had a lot 
of fun and a lot of laughs, because we were so gravely concerned 
with the suffering of the people in the Balkins,'' Clinton said in 
a pre-dinner toast to his fellow leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary General Javier Solana alluded to his previous  
occupation as a physicist, relating the concept of motion in the 
natural sciences to NATO's role in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``When history moves very fast, an organization, if it wants to  
be relevant, has to move faster than history,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders, Republicans and Democrats alike, staged  
their own welcome in the Rotunda for NATO's newest members. The 
summit also brought to Washington the leaders of nearly two dozen 
nations sharing a partnership with NATO -- although Russia and 
Belarus boycotted in protest of the bombing of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Without equivocation, summit leaders pledged to stop Milosevic  
and set out the conditions he must meet to call off NATO's 
airstrikes: Stop all violence, withdraw his military and police 
forces, agree to the stationing of an international military force, 
permit the safe return of all refugees and accept autonomy for 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement warned Milosevic not to widen the war to frontline  
states such as Albania and Macedonia, promising that NATO would 
respond. It said the alliance would suspend airstrikes once 
Yugoslavia had ``demonstrably begun to withdraw its forces from 
Kosovo according to a precise and rapid timetable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The allies dismissed a Russian initiative to settle the conflict  
since Belgrade still refused to accept a NATO-led military force to 
enforce peace. Still, the leaders said they wanted to work 
constructively with Russia and that Moscow had ``an important role 
to play in the search for a solution to the conflict in Kosovo.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Pledges To Continue Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO leaders opened a celebration of the  
alliance's 50th anniversary today with a pledge to press on with 
the air campaign against Yugoslavia. ``When we fight, we fight to 
prevail,'' President Clinton declared. 
</P>
<P>
	As 19 NATO leaders met to discuss the Kosovo crisis, Clinton  
said, ``We send a clear message of unity and determination to 
sustain our air campaign for as long as it takes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Western leaders rejected a diplomatic overture from Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic to end the month-old air attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic must know there is no place for his policies in  
Europe on the eve of the 21st century,'' NATO Secretary-General 
Javier Solana said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also welcomed NATO's newest members, former Warsaw Pact  
nations Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, and said that NATO 
``could not remain indifferent'' to Milosevic's tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO allies are united in their resolve to see this challenge  
through,'' he declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there are 42 presidents and prime ministers here for  
the summit, only NATO's 19 members met for the opening three-hour 
discussion to ponder their next moves in the Balkans crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO leaders have insisted Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic  
call off his crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and accept a 
settlement that would include an armed international peacekeeping 
force in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's brief remarks to reporters came at the White House as  
he left for the opening session of the alliance's three-day summit, 
which brought together presidents and prime ministers of the 19 
NATO countries and 23 partner states. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair rejected  
Milosevic's offer to accept some form of international force in the 
Serbian province of Kosovo because it fell short of NATO's demand 
for a military presence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that damage continues,'' Blair said. The  
British leader, however, sounded some guarded optimism. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not enough because it doesn't meet the demands that NATO  
has set out,'' Blair said. ``But if it is an indication that 
Milosevic now realizes that we will carry on until those demands 
are met, then to that extent it is something we should note.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also rejected Milosevic's offer as falling ``well short  
of the conditions to end the bombing,'' White House spokesman David 
Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president reacted cautiously to the offer Thursday. ``If  
there is an offer for a genuine security force, that's the first 
time Mr. Milosevic has ever done that, and that represents, I 
suppose, some step forward,'' Clinton said at a joint Rose Garden 
appearance with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit-eve overture was relayed from Belgrade by former  
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who said Milosevic 
would accept the idea of a U.N.-controlled ``international 
presence'' in Kosovo if the bombing stops and NATO withdraws troops 
from Yugoslavia's borders. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the leaders gathered here under extraordinary security  
precautions, the air campaign against Yugoslavia, now in its fifth 
week, continued. The headquarters of Belgrade's main television 
network was hit, and NATO destroyed one of Milosevic's homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the alliance was now targeting Milosevic, Clinton said,  
``No, but we are targeting his command and control facilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO leaders planned a morning session on Kosovo with the issue  
of ground troops -- initially ruled out -- now sitting unsteadily on 
the table. 
</P>
<P>
	The subject is ``not formally on the agenda'' but could be  
discussed by individual members, said a NATO official briefing 
reporters on condition of anonymity. ``Do not expect any decision 
on ground troops at this summit,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials also were pushing for a blockade or embargo on  
oil going into Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO official said the alliance would issue a formal  
declaration today reiterating its demands to Milosevic, and express 
NATO's confidence in the air campaign as the primary instrument for 
degrading Yugoslav forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton bestowed his support on Solana's decision to have NATO  
military leaders update contingency plans, including one for a 
possible ground assault. The president called it ``a wise and 
prudent course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Clinton and other western leaders continued to stress  
they believed the conflict could be ended with an intensifying air 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bombing is working, but we need to intensify it and carry  
it on,'' Blair said on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all NATO leaders were comfortable with the progress of the  
air war. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said prolonged bombing of  
Yugoslavia could turn his nation against NATO and the United 
States. While sticking to Greece's official support, Simitis said: 
``The more the war continues, the more difficult the problems will 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders planned an early afternoon gathering to celebrate  
the April 4, 1949, signing of the treaty that established the Cold 
War alliance to confront the Soviet Union in Europe. It was to be 
followed by a reception at the Capitol and a White House dinner. 
The summit concludes Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Security was extremely tight.  
</P>
<P>
	To minimize traffic gridlock for the largest international  
summit in the city's history, thousands of federal employes were 
given the day off. Schools were closed, as well as many businesses 
in a 100-square-block downtown security zone. Even some of the 
Smithsonian museums on the National Mall were closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The event had been planned as a jubilant 50th anniversary  
celebration -- and to welcome three newest members, former Warsaw 
Pact nations Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	But the festivities were muted by concern over the conflict in  
Kosovo, where Serb-led Yugoslav forces have forced hundreds of 
thousands of ethnic Albanians to flee.

<HEADLINE> New Earthquake Threat Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Living in the New Madrid earthquake zone along  
the Mississippi River may not be as dangerous as had been thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Devastating quakes rocked the region from St. Louis to Memphis,  
Tenn., and beyond in 1811-12. The Mississippi reportedly flowed 
backward for a time. 
</P>
<P>
	A new analysis of the region in today's issue of the journal  
Science contends that the likelihood of a repeat of that event has 
been overstated. 
</P>
<P>
	Newly gathered data ``imply that 1811-1812-size earthquakes are  
either much smaller or far less frequent than previously assumed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In either case, it seems that the hazard from great  
earthquakes in the New Madrid zone has been significantly 
overestimated,'' reports the team of scientists lead by Seth Stein 
of Northwestern University. 
</P>
<P>
	Minor tremors continue to occur in the area, raising concern  
that a repeat of the powerful earlier quakes could cause 
devastation in the modern cities that have grown there. 
</P>
<P>
	Stein's team used both satellite and ground-based measurements  
to check current movement along the New Madrid fault, and 
calculated it to be between zero and 2 millimeters per year. Two 
millimeters is a bit less than a tenth of an inch. 
</P>
<P>
	Geological motions are very constant over time, Stein explained  
in a telephone interview. The very low motion along the fault, he 
said, indicates as much as a 14,000-year period between magnitude-8 
quakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most plausible interpretation of our data is that the  
(1811-12) quakes were probably magnitude 7 instead of 8 (that had 
been previously estimated). That's the simplest explanation and 
what we think is most likely,'' said Stein, whose research was 
supported financially by the university consortium UNAVCO. 
</P>
<P>
	A magnitude-8 quake, capable of tremendous damage, is 10 times  
more powerful than a 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Stein noted that quakes in the eastern United States are felt  
over larger areas than western ones because of the more rigid rock 
in the East. That may have resulted in the overestimation of the 
early quakes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The conclusions were challenged by Arch Johnston, a seismologist  
at the University of Memphis, who contended that the Northwestern 
team understated the uncertainty in their measurements. 
</P>
<P>
	Actual movement along the plate could be as much as 10  
millimeters a year, Johnston said, which would indicate a major 
quake could occur every 400 to 600 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very certain about our uncertainty,'' responded Andrew  
Newman, a graduate student who was part of Stein's team. He said 
the 2-millimeter movement estimate is ``at the 95 percent 
confidence level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stein's team also suggested that, because the danger has been  
overestimated, changes should be considered in the National Seismic 
Hazard Maps for the New Madrid area. 
</P>
<P>
	That suggestion is ``premature and actually irresponsible,''  
Johnston responded. He noted that the seismic hazard maps are used 
when building codes are being developed to set safe construction 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stein stood by his calculations, contending the danger  
ratings of current seismic hazard maps seem very unlikely in light 
of current understanding.

<HEADLINE> Allied Air Campaign Widened Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sea-launched cruise missiles struck two  
electric power transformers in the Belgrade area overnight, marking 
a further escalation of NATO's air campaign, the Pentagon said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a new class of targets,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth  
Bacon said at a briefing at which he announced that allied 
warplanes flew 434 missions Thursday despite bad weather. The 
electric power transformers were struck by Tomahawk cruise 
missiles, which use satellites for precise guidance. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said the electrical power sites also served residential  
and business customers but were struck because they supply power to 
military command and control facilities linked to the Yugoslav 
army. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon also announced that the Pentagon has decided not to add a  
second aircraft carrier to the NATO naval force attacking 
Yugoslavia. The USS Enterprise, sailing in the Mediterranean Sea, 
will return to its home port at Norfolk, Va., in early May as 
scheduled rather than join the fight over Kosovo, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Enterprise, with 75 aircraft and 5,500 sailors aboard, had  
been operating in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's coming home,'' Bacon said.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials had been considering diverting the Enterprise to the  
Adriatic Sea as part of a strengthening of U.S. and allied air 
power for Operation Allied Force. But the Navy prevailed in its 
argument that the carrier and its battle group of surface ships and 
submarines should return on time. 
</P>
<P>
	The USS Theodore Roosevelt battle group is operating in the NATO  
campaign, along with British and French carriers. Strike aircraft 
from the Roosevelt attacked a column of seven Yugoslav armored 
personnel carriers overnight and apparently inflicted heavy damage, 
defense officials said, speaking anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
	After a month of NATO bombing, Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic is having difficulty moving his troops, supplying them or 
maintaining their loyalty, the Pentagon says. 
</P>
<P>
	The air campaign has heavily damaged roads, bridges and resupply  
depots, as well as important communications systems and significant 
percentages of Serb weaponry, Pentagon officials said Thursday in 
one of their most-detailed briefings yet of the damage done by the 
NATO airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The more than 9,000 air missions over Yugoslavia and its  
rebellious province of Kosovo have left Milosevic's army more 
vulnerable to a NATO ground campaign, should the alliance undertake 
that step, said Rear Adm. Thomas Wilson, director of intelligence 
for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebel ethnic Albanian guerrillas on the ground inside Kosovo  
also are rebounding as NATO pounds Yugoslav troops, equipment, 
supplies and command-and-control facilities from the air, Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So that fact, combined with the destruction of the  
infrastructure, the reduction of the force structure, would make it 
more difficult in my view for a defense of the country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials have said Yugoslav troops already are digging  
into defensive positions and mining key land routes into Kosovo, 
maneuvers that would complicate any NATO ground offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton called NATO's plans to update its ground  
invasion scenario ``a wise and prudent course,'' but stressed that 
NATO intended to stick with the air campaign and had no intention 
of launching a ground offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``A vigorous prosecution of the air campaign, an intensification  
of economic pressures, along with our continuing diplomatic efforts 
I believe is the correct strategy, and I believe it will succeed,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its attack on the Yugoslav command structure, NATO  
missiles hit one of Milosevic's residences in Belgrade on Thursday. 
U.S. officials from Clinton on down denied that NATO was trying to 
kill the Yugoslav leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. military offered the unusually specific picture of  
allied operations and the sunniest outlook so far as NATO leaders 
gathered in Washington for a commemoration of the alliance's 50 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now there is increasing evidence, both among forces in Kosovo  
and among the Serbian army in general, that this campaign is having 
an impact on their morale,'' Wilson said.

<HEADLINE> Mom Jailed for Sex With Daughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A mother was sentenced to 30 years in prison  
for forcing her teen-age daughter to perform sex acts with her in a 
jail visiting room so her inmate husband could watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm concerned, you have forfeited any right  
whatsoever ... of being a parent,'' Circuit Judge Chet Tharpe told 
the woman, who was not identified in order to protect the identity 
of her 15-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman was sentenced Wednesday after a jury found her guilty  
of lewd and lascivious acts, a crime punishable by up to 75 years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The 42-year-old woman took the girl to visit her new husband in  
jail last October and forced her to perform sex acts with her as 
her 27-year-old husband watched through a clear window, according 
to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The two made several visits that month to the husband, who was  
jailed on a domestic violence charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman testified that her husband threatened to kill her and  
her daughter if they didn't comply, but a sexually explicit letter 
to him implied otherwise: ``Hi Hon! What's up? I enjoyed doing that 
last night while you were watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-ager is now living with a foster family.

<HEADLINE> Ray Stevens Has Prostate Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Grammy winner Ray Stevens has prostate  
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This diagnosis came as a big surprise, but I have complete  
confidence in my physician's ability to help me fight this 
disease,'' Stevens said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60-year-old singer said the disease is in its early stages.  
He urged every man over 50 to get tested. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, Stevens turned a national craze for running nude into a  
novelty hit with ``The Streak.'' He won Grammys for ``Everything Is 
Beautiful'' in 1970 and his banjo-flavored arrangement of ``Misty'' 
in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 41 on Profit Taking / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fell today, pulling back in  
profit-taking after a three-day rally. Concerns about AT&AMP;T's bid 
for cable operator MediaOne also affected trading. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 41.52 at 10,685.66 after closing up 145 points Thursday at 
10,727.18, its 10th record high close in 14 sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also declined today.  
</P>
<P>
	``The market is certainly overdue for a pause to refresh,'' said  
Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; 
Sons Inc. in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even bull markets have to rest their engines,'' he said.  
``That's all today is -- a chance to catch our breath and look at 
how strong this market has been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, a Dow component, fell after news of its $58 billion  
hostile bid for MediaOne, the nation's fourth-largest cable 
operator. AT&AMP;T is trying to thwart a merger agreement reached last 
month between MediaOne and No. 3 cable television company Comcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors worry that the deal could hurt AT&AMP;T's earnings.  
</P>
<P>
	``This deal spooks the market a little bit because AT&AMP;T has been  
one of the better performing stocks and there is concern about how 
this will affect it,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief investment 
strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co., in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think fundamentally this positions AT&AMP;T tremendously for the  
longer term,'' he said. ``Today, we are seeing a knee-jerk 
reaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T was down 3 3/16 at 53 9/16. MediaOne was up 7 3/8 at 76 7/8.  
</P>
<P>
	A pullback in technology stocks also contributed to the weakness  
on Wall Street. After a fierce selloff on Monday, technology shares 
soared over the last three days, prompting investors to collect 
some of their profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 5.21 at  
2,556.40. The Nasdaq fell 138 points on Monday, but climbed 216 
points in the last three days. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 342.69 million 
shares, down from 427.89 million shares on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 7.84 at 1,350.98, the  
NYSE composite index was down 2.78 at 638.19, and the American 
Stock Exchange composite index was up 5.60 at 763.98.

<HEADLINE> Blues Serve As Phoenix Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Phoenix coach Jim Schoenfeld called a 40-minute  
meeting Friday for special teams that underlined the Coyotes' 
power-play problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix entered the playoffs fourth in the Western Conference, a  
lofty perch for a team that finished 26th in power-play scoring. 
But St. Louis has the home-ice advantage now after beating the 
Coyotes 3-1 Thursday night to take a 1-0 lead into Game 2 on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're feeling a little bit of the pressure that's  
put on them to get out of the first round,'' Blues center Craig 
Conroy said. ``They definitely feel like they have to win, and for 
us it would be a huge thing to go back 2-0. You couldn't ask for a 
better scenario.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes are in their 14th playoff-opening series. They got  
past the first round only in 1985 and 1987, a record of futility 
that dogged the team through a franchise shift from Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues, by contrast, advanced 11 times in 19 consecutive  
playoff appearances from 1980-98, and their latest victory showed 
clearly that they are what Phoenix hoped to be -- loose, confident, 
with a hot goalie and devastating special teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Pellerin's empty-net goal aside, St. Louis won on slap  
shots by defensemen from the blue line, and missed -- by a fraction 
of a second -- scoring on two of their three power plays. 
</P>
<P>
	A Blues advantage was ending when Al MacInnis blasted a screamer  
past Phoenix goalie Nikolai Khabibulin only 2:22 into the game. In 
the second period, the Coyotes overcompensated to guard MacInnis on 
another power play, and Jamie Rivers scored for a 2-0 lead that was 
plenty with Grant Fuhr in the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuhr had 26 saves and didn't give up Phoenix's goal until 1:52  
was left, winning for the 87th time in the playoffs. Only Billy 
Smith (88) and Colorado's Patrick Roy (99) have more. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning breeds confidence, and, fortunately, at the start of  
my career I had a chance to win a lot,'' said Fuhr, who won five 
Stanley Cups with Edmonton. ``You get a good feeling about yourself 
when you're winning and, through good and bad, you can always look 
back on times when things were good and bring something from 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schoenfeld acknowledged there was little he could do about Fuhr,  
but promised some changes in the Phoenix lineup. One is the return 
of Keith Tkachuk to his accustomed spot at left wing after a 
one-game experiment at center. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the focus of the meeting was to get the power-play unit  
back on track after an 0-for-6 performance that included a decisive 
span of 1:19 in the first period when the Coyotes had a 5-on-3 but 
couldn't score. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't mind if the guy makes three or four great saves, but  
we couldn't get a shot,'' Schoenfeld said. ``And some of their best 
scoring opportunities came on our power play. That's no good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tkachuk, rejected by Fuhr six times, declined to discuss the new  
first line but promised a better effort in front of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to keep plugging away, because the goals will  
come,'' Tkachuk said.

<HEADLINE> NASCAR Fails To Attract Blacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- About the only time black and white get  
together at a stock-car race is on the checkered flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite years of growth and increasing popularity, NASCAR's lack  
of racial diversity was plain as more than 300 people gathered at a 
hall of fame luncheon: Nearly every black face belonged to a waiter 
or waitress. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 35 years after the late Wendell Scott became the first  
minority driver to win on NASCAR's top level, he remains its only 
black champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The premier Winston Cup circuit has no black drivers, and blacks  
will make up only a fraction of the nearly 200,000 fans expected 
for Sunday's DieHard 500 at the Talladega Superspeedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods boosted minority interest in golf, but racing  
remains a virtually all-white world where Confederate battle flags 
wave in the infield each week. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Blacks) don't feel a part,'' said Franklin Scott, son of  
Wendell Scott, who was inducted posthumously on Thursday into the 
International Motorsports Hall of Fame, located in Talladega. ``The 
effort hasn't been made to attract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Driver-turned-commentator Benny Parsons believes the days of  
blatant racism are gone from racing. ``People say we don't want 
them, but I don't see any evidence of that,'' Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet two roadblocks remain to getting more blacks into NASCAR,  
according to Parsons: the high cost of racing and the fact that 
it's what he calls a ``suburban'' sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most suburban people are Caucasian,'' Parsons said. ``Urban  
people just don't have the chance and the privilege to get out and 
drive like people out in the suburbs, out in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Kimmel, 1998 champion of the second-tier ARCA racing  
circuit, recalls competing against only a couple of blacks as he 
moved up through the ranks, and that was on small, dirt tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimmel had some black crew members, however, and they talked  
openly about the difficulty of being the only minorities in a white 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough for them to be admitted into such a redneck sport.  
We don't like to admit it, but it is a redneck sport,'' said 
Kimmel, 36, of Jeffersonville, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, NASCAR races are run coast-to-coast, and many of its fans  
are far from the South. But in Scott's day, racing was almost 
exclusively a Southern affair, with events held in small towns 
where racial segregation was still hanging on. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I started going to the races I was afraid myself,'' said  
Scott's daughter-in-law, Mabel Scott of Danville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Scott, wife of Franklin Scott, vividly remembers the time  
more than 20 years ago when a white fan approached her at a race in 
Maine and asked to touch her dark skin. 
</P>
<P>
	``She had never been that close to a black person before,'' Mrs.  
Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott's lone win in the top NASCAR division came Dec. 1, 1963,  
in Jacksonville, Fla. Despite having little money and a pit crew 
made up of his sons, he consistently finished near the top of the 
point standings for the next five years. He died in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR may yet get its version of Tiger Woods.  
</P>
<P>
	And, Parsons said, one thing is for sure: That driver will  
instantly become one of the top stars on the circuit just by virtue 
of being there. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Jeff Gordon were black, he'd be worth even more than he is  
white,'' Parsons said.

<HEADLINE> High Security, Protests Greet NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hundreds of Albanian-Americans chanted ``bomb,  
NATO, bomb,'' as groups with strongly divergent views on the 
airstrikes against Yugoslavia rallied today on the opening day of 
the alliance's 50th anniversary summit. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrying the red and black flag of Albania along with the U.S.  
flag, some 400 protesters organized by the National 
Albanian-American Council gathered in front of the White House to 
observe a moment of silence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not all Serbs are bad people. It is just the brutal regime we  
are fighting,'' said Nick Mehmeti, a businessman from Dallas who 
flew in for the rally. ``It is too late for negotiations at this 
point. Seventy-five percent of our villages are burned and 75 
percent of our people are homeless. We support the NATO troops, but 
we want them to put in ground troops also. Better yet, arm the KLA 
and we can take care of our own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Washington Monument, dozens of protesters organized by  
the Fourth Freedom Forum opposed the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our focus is the present nuclear dilemma facing the world,''  
said Alisair Miller, director of the group's Washington office. 
``NATO's nuclear weapons were introduced decades ago to counter a 
perceived threat that no longer exists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said he feared that potential protesters were scared away  
because of reports about the tight security imposed in Washington 
because of the summit. 
</P>
<P>
	A local Serbian church organized a protest for Saturday calling  
for an end to the bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are protesting the bombing because we consider it illegal  
and civilian people are being killed,'' said Zoran Hodjera, 
congregation president of St. Luke Serbian Orthodox Church in 
Washington, which is organizing the rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodjera, the Serbian Orthodox church official, said any  
atrocities against ethnic Albanians that the Serb-led government 
are accused of were brought on by the bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the bombing, we had only minor problems,'' Hodjera  
said. ``We never had any true negotiations between the parties. 
That avenue was never pursued properly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Park Police officials said permits were given to the three  
groups for summit-related protests. 
</P>
<P>
	The protests struck a sobering note during what has been planned  
as the largest gathering of foreign leaders ever to visit 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in a city well accustomed to the high security measures  
accorded important guests, the safety measures surrounding the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit are bringing together 18 
law enforcement agencies, led by the Secret Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Just because there have been no credible threats of terrorist  
attack so far ``doesn't mean that in any way our vigilance is low 
or that our guard is not up,'' said Deputy Attorney General Eric 
Holder said. ``We are prepared for just about anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the three days of the meeting, downtown Washington has  
become one big high-security area for dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal workers in the city's core around the White House were  
excused from work Friday. Many private businesses followed the 
government's lead. Vehicle and pedestrian traffic will be blocked 
in the vicinity of the summit headquarters through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents of Washington, D.C. school students received letters  
this week notifying them schools would be closed Friday and all 
athletic events scheduled for Friday, Saturday and Sunday would be 
canceled and rescheduled for a later date.

<HEADLINE> Mark McGwire Back in Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mark McGwire, who missed 1 1/2 games with a  
tight left hamstring, was back in the lineup Friday night when the 
St. Louis Cardinals opened a three-game series against the Los 
Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Greeted by a mix of cheers and boos in his first at-bat, McGwire  
struck out swinging against Chan Ho Park. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who has five homers this year after hitting a  
record-breaking 70 last season, looked perfectly healthy while he 
was taking batting practice, booming balls into the left-field 
pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
	He left the fifth inning of the Cardinals' game Tuesday night  
and sat out the next game. They were off on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire missed all three games of the Cardinals' games at Dodger  
Stadium last year because of back spasms.

<HEADLINE> University To Push Sweatshop Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Dozens of students ended a four-day  
sit-in today at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 
after the school agreed to push for humane working conditions at 
overseas factories where UNC clothing is made. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting Chancellor William McCoy said he will ask the 500  
companies that make the popular sky-blue UNC T-shirts and other 
gear to abide by certain working conditions, including a ``living 
wage'' for employees and independent monitoring of factories. 
</P>
<P>
	The school could eventually cut off contract rights to companies  
who do not comply. 
</P>
<P>
	``These recommendations are consistent with the way our  
university should be conducting business,'' McCoy said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 75 students had camped outside McCoy's office suite since  
Tuesday, vowing to stay until changes were made. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion Traub-Warner, a student organizer, said the agreement  
``set a strong precedent for other large public universities on the 
issue of sweatshop labor and the collegiate apparel industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue arose two years ago when students protested working  
conditions at Nike factories in Third World countries after Nike 
signed a $7.1 million contract with UNC-Chapel Hill in 1997 to 
outfit Tar Heel athletic teams. Students said the university has 
contracts with hundreds of apparel and trinket manufacturers, large 
and small. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike spokesman Vada Manager said his company has no quarrel with  
the university's action and said the company has committed to 
disclosure in a letter to UNC. 
</P>
<P>
	Wages for Nike workers in Indonesia have been increased 50  
percent in 12 months, to a top pay of $65 a month in a country 
where rent is $5 to $7 a month, Manager said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Conceptually, what Carolina has done here mirrors what we've  
done,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike employs about 500,000 people making footwear, apparel and  
equipment in 40 countries in Asia, Latin America and the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	UNC-Chapel Hill ranks among leading universities in sales of  
products bearing its name. About $75 million worth of products were 
sold in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina was one of several campuses where protests were  
staged this week. Others included the University of Arizona, the 
University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of 
California-Berkeley. Berkeley students rallied outside the 
headquarters of the state university system in Oakland, Calif., on 
Friday.

	NATO Resolves To Continue Bombing  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- As NATO leaders threaten to  
intensify the attacks until Yugoslavia relents, President Clinton 
described Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic's regime as ``the last 
European dictatorship of the 20th century.'' ``The alliance will 
not have meaning in the 21st century if it permits the slaughter of 
innocents on its doorsteps,'' Clinton said at a ceremony 
commemorating the 1949 signing of the NATO charter. NATO 
Secretary-General Javier Solana welcomed Poland, Hungary and the 
Czech Republic into the alliance. The Balkans crisis brings with 
NATO membership ``not only a feeling of comfort, it is also about 
shared responsibility,'' said Poland's president, Aleksander 
Kwasiniewski.

	NATO Dismisses Russia Peace Plan  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE (AP) -- A Russian mediator pushing to settle the Kosovo  
conflict today claimed Yugoslavia is willing to accept an 
international military force, but officials in Belgrade said 
Milosevic only backs an unarmed force in Kosovo -- contrary to a key 
element of a Western-backed peace plan. NATO rejected the plan, 
repeating demands that Yugoslavia's president end the violent 
campaign in Kosovo, remove his troops and accept an international 
peacekeeping force. French President Jacques Chirac welcomed 
Russia's efforts but called the proposal ``totally insufficient.''

they begin questioning other members of the Trenchcoat Mafia and 
try to trace the gunmen's weapons. The governor toured Columbine 
High School today and emerged saying investigators were all but 
certain that the two gunmen had help from others. Police said 
security cameras may provide crucial evidence of a conspiracy. Vice

	CHRISTIANSBURG, Va. (AP) -- San Francisco 49ers reserve  
quarterback Jim Druckenmiller was charged with rape in an 
indictment unsealed today. The one-paragraph indictment said the 
crime took place March 4, and that the woman and a detective 
testified before a grand jury on April 13. No other details were 
contained in the indictment. Neither prosecutors in Montgomery 
County nor lawyers for Druckenmiller would discuss the matter.

<HEADLINE> Schools Act Against Copycat Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A wave of threats copycatting the Columbine High School  
shootings in Colorado have driven hundreds of students from schools 
across the country and led to multiple arrests, law officers say. 
</P>
<P>
	In south-central Washington state, a high school student in  
Prosser was arrested for investigation of threatening to blow up 
his school. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-year-old allegedly told another student that he ``would  
like to position ... anti-personnel mines in every class, set them 
off simultaneously and kill everyone in the school,'' according to 
documents filed Thursday in Benton County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers searched the suspect's home but did not find any bombs  
or bomb-making materials, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Palmdale, Calif., two high school students who made  
references to the ``Trenchcoat Mafia'' were arrested Thursday after 
one threatened another student and the other talked about 
bomb-making, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the students allegedly told a girl that he thought the  
Littleton, Colo., attack -- which left 12 students, a teacher and 
the two teen-age gunmen dead -- was funny. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told her that if he ever began to act crazy like the two  
killers in Colorado, she would be the first that he would kill,'' 
said sheriff's Deputy Steve Owen. 
</P>
<P>
	Trench coats like the ones worn by the two gunmen have been  
banned in Denver and some other Colorado districts since the attack 
for fear they could be used to hide weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Three teen-agers in Cherry Hill, N.J., were suspended from their  
high school for 10 days for standing in a hallway Thursday clad in 
black trench coats and pantomiming gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will take tough discipline against anyone showing bad  
judgment, serious or not,'' said Superintendent Morton Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents in The Colony, northwest of Dallas, took more than 200  
children home Thursday from a middle school after hearing rumors 
about a 14-year-old's alleged threat to shoot a classmate. 
</P>
<P>
	The same day, threatening graffiti inside a Wylie, Texas, school  
cafeteria resulted in a search by bomb-sniffing dogs. About 450 of 
the school's 600 students went home, even though nothing was found. 
</P>
<P>
	And a seventh-grade girl in Mesquite, an eastern Dallas suburb,  
was suspended after she allegedly showed classmates a list of 35 
students she wished were dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, what happened in Colorado has caused every district  
to re-examine the way they handle possible threats and security 
issues,'' said Ian Halperin of the Mesquite Independent School 
District. ``Things that previously were taken lightly or ignored 
will now be re-examined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Pennsylvania, a Berks County high school was to remain closed  
today after authorities found and detonated a package that appeared 
to be a pipe bomb hidden on a campus roof. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured. The package was found after someone who  
sounded like a teen-age boy phoned in a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	A high school in Newton, Pa., was also to be closed today after  
officials heard of ``rumors circulating in the high school that 
contained the threat of potential violence,'' said principal David 
Yates. A security sweep was planned as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ohio, four teen-age boys were taken into custody for  
allegedly making threats, including a 13-year-old who said 
Wednesday he was going ``to come into the school with a gun and 
kill all of the people that he didn't like,'' said Police Chief 
Scott Ballentine in Tuscarawas, 90 miles east of Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	Evaluating copycat threats is difficult, said psychologist David  
Walsh, director of the National Institute on Media and the Family 
in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a challenge to walk the middle line and not go to the  
extreme so that every kid who wears a black jacket becomes a 
suspect,'' he said.

                       *Godfrey H.P. Anderson    	
</P>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Godfrey H.P. Anderson, a World War II  
correspondent for The Associated Press who was taken prisoner in 
North Africa, died Tuesday of a stroke. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who was born in London, worked for the AP for 38  
years. He worked as a writer and photo editor for the AP in his 
native country and later served as head of the news cooperative's 
photo bureau in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to serve as a war correspondent in Ethiopia, Egypt,  
Palestine, Syria and France and chief of bureau in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	His duty was interrupted for 3 1/2 years when he was taken prisoner  
in 1941 by German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's forces in Libya and 
held prisoner in German camps in Libya, Italy and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson transferred to the AP's Dallas office in 1970, after  
his wife was offered a job with the Dallas Times Herald. He became 
a U.S. citizen two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his wife, Nadeane Walker Anderson, he is survived  
by a son and daughter.

                           *William Bowen    	
</P>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Former state Sen. William Bowen, a  
champion of civil rights who later sponsored a law giving 
minorities more state contracts, died on Thursday of cancer. He was 
70. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving the Legislature in 1995, the Democrat spent  
nearly 25 years in the Ohio Senate -- believed to be the longest 
term served in the body by a black. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowen was known for sponsoring ``set aside'' legislation  
requiring that some state contracts go to minority-owned businesses 
and for work on tax incentives in high unemployment areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowen was also president of the Cincinnati NAACP from 1958-64,  
where he helped blacks win jobs at private companies and in the 
police department. 
</P>
<P>
	He was elected to the House in 1966 and became the third-ranking  
Democratic leader. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970, he was appointed to the Senate. He was elected to the  
seat the same year, later becoming chairman and ranking minority 
member of the Senate Finance Committee. He left the Senate in 
January 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite successes on the local and state level, he was defeated  
in two runs for the 1st District U.S. House seat, in 1976 and 1994.

                             *Tom Davis    	
</P>
<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Tom Davis, founder of Piedmont  
Airlines, died Thursday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis founded Piedmont Aviation, which first sold  
single-propeller planes to private pilots in the 1940s and then 
became one of the country's biggest airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Piedmont completed a merger with US Airways in 1989, when  
Piedmont had about 21,500 employees and annual revenues of $2.5 
billion. After the merger, Davis served as director emeritus. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was captivated by aviation at an early age. While in high  
school, he was spending his allowance on flying lessons at the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Piedmont's first commercial flight took off on Feb. 20, 1948.  
Davis was on board as the plane taxied onto the runway in 
Wilmington, N.C., and made several stops before terminating in 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	After his retirement in 1983, he continued to fly until 1998.

</P>
<P>
	JOHNSTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Frank J. Pasquerilla, chairman and CEO of  
Crown American Realty Trust, died Wednesday. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, Pasquerilla's estimated $350 million fortune earned him  
a place on Forbes Magazine's list of the 400 wealthiest Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	He shared his wealth, providing a performing arts center for the  
University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown and $1 million toward 
creation of a heritage discovery center for the city. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Pasquerilla paid the air fare for a 10-year-old  
Bosnian boy, Nebojsa Pisaric, and his mother, Dragica, to go to 
Johnstown so the boy could be treated for his lone failing kidney.

</P>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Gian-Carlo Rota, a Massachusetts  
Institute of Technology mathematician and philosopher, died Monday. 
He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
	Rota, who began teaching at MIT in 1959, was the only faculty  
member ever to hold the title of professor of mathematics and 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rota is credited with transforming his specialty area,  
combinatorics, from an insignificant field to one of the most 
important areas of mathematics, said Richard Stanley, an MIT math 
professor and former student of Rota's. 
</P>
<P>
	Rota was the author of seven books, founding editor of three  
journals and the recipient of numerous prizes and honorary degrees. 
He published close to 200 papers in mathematics or philosophy, and 
more than 500 book reviews.

<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Su Shueh-lin, an eminent writer and  
veteran of China's 1919 May Fourth Movement for free expression, 
died Wednesday of complications from a lung infection. She was 104. 
</P>
<P>
	In a career spanning 70 years, Ms. Su produced more than 50  
published works, including collections of essays, classical Chinese 
poetry, novels and literary criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Her works had a deep impact on generations of leaders and  
political reformers. Cheng Kung University, where she taught until 
retiring 30 years ago, published a 15-volume collection of her 
life's work and memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Su became caught up in the movement for political, social  
and cultural freedom in May 1919 while a student at Beijing's 
Women's Normal College. 
</P>
<P>
	After studying in France, Ms. Su returned to teach at various  
universities around China. In the 1930s, she produced her best 
known and most influential works: a novel, ``Thorn Heart,'' and a 
collection of essays, ``Green Sky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A recurrent theme in her writing was criticism of communism and  
the intrusion of politics into art and literature. In 1949, She 
fled to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists ahead of the 
takeover of the mainland by Mao Tse-tung's communists. She returned 
to mainland China only once, last year.

	Coca-Cola Sued for Discrimination  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Four past and current black employees of  
Coca-Cola Co. are suing the soft-drink giant for discrimination, 
claiming blacks are paid less and have fewer opportunities to 
advance than white employees. The suit was filed in U.S. District 
Court in Atlanta by Washington attorneys Cyrus Mehri and Pamela 
Coukos. Mehri, a veteran of corporate discrimination cases, 
represented black employees who sued Texaco in a case that resulted 
in a landmark $176 million settlement in 1996. A Coke spokesman, 
who has yet to see the lawsuit, said he doesn't believe the case 
has merit. Coca-Cola stock remained unchanged at 66 1/2.

	Kellogg Profits Fall 26 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- Cereal maker Kellogg Co. reported its  
first-quarter earnings fell 26 percent. Kellogg has lost market 
share in recent years amid competition from cheaper supermarket 
brands, and has also seen sales drop as Americans eat less cereal 
and more bagels and muffins for breakfast. It has been 
restructuring over the past year, cutting nearly 800 jobs. Kellogg 
shares closed down 3/8 at 36 5/8.

<P>
	Mobil's Earnings Fall 34 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- Mobil Corp. reported its first-quarter  
earnings fell 34 percent, the result of depressed crude prices that 
have eroded profits for most oil companies. The nation's 
second-largest oil company, which plans to merge with Exxon Corp., 
said it earned $464 million, down from $705 million, in the first 
quarter of 1998. Demand for oil and refined products has fallen 
because of weak economic conditions in Asia, Latin America, Russia 
and other parts of the world, forcing oil companies to lower the 
prices they charge customers.

	AT&AMP;T Makes $58B Bid For MediaOne  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. has offered $58 billion for  
Denver-based cable company MediaOne. The telephone giant is seeking 
to thwart a merger agreement recently reached between MediaOne and 
No. 3 cable television company Comcast. If successful, AT&AMP;T would 
become the largest cable company in the United States with the 
ability to reach more than 40 percent of the nation's cable 
households, one analyst estimated. The Comcast deal is valued at 
about $49 billion. AT&AMP;T stock fell 3 3/8 to 53 3/8.

	Merck Sales Jump 24 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merck &AMP; Co. reported Friday its first-quarter  
profits rose 12 percent as sales for the nation's top drug maker 
rose 24 percent. Merck attributed the big gains to the strength of 
several established heart drugs and its pharmacy benefits business, 
but said increased spending on research and marketing restricted 
its earnings growth somewhat. Despite the strong results, Merck's 
stock slipped as investors worried that sales of Merck's 
top-selling drug Zocor, an anti-cholesterol medication, were 
slowing. Merck shares lost 2 1/8 to 75 3/4.

	Dow Closes Down 37.51 at 10,689.67

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were narrowly mixed today in a  
session marked by profit-taking following Wall Street's three-day 
rally. AT&AMP;T's bold bid for cable operator MediaOne sent the 
company's stock tumbling and broke a three-day winning streak in 
the Dow Jones industrials. At the close, the Dow was down 37.51 at 
10,689.67. The Nasdaq composite was up 29.08 to 2,590.69, a new 
high, but the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 edged lower. The Nasdaq was 
helped by Gateway 2000's earnings report, which confirmed strong 
demand for personal computers.

	Some AOL Shareholders Cashing In  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc. said several major  
shareholders, including Sprint Corp., will sell stakes valued at 
about $4.61 billion. Sprint will cash out its entire AOL holding of 
28.8 million shares, a 2.8 percent stake. Sprint purchased 450,000 
shares of AOL, the largest Internet access provider and online 
service, for $31.25 each in 1993. But the long-distance provider 
hedged the transaction to lock in gains and will realize a profit 
of only about $100 million. Based on Thursday's closing price, the 
AOL stock would be worth $4.3 billion. AOL stock fell 2 3/16 to 146 
1/2 on Friday, as did Sprint PCS Group: 7/8 to 47 11/16.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Computer chip maker Intel Corp. is planning a  
big move to the Internet. The microprocessor giant will create a 
data-services center. Intel itself will not become an Internet 
service provider, but it will provide outsourcing services to those 
companies. Intel will set up data centers with thousands of 
powerful computers known as servers to provide data processing, 
storage and other computing services for companies that connect 
users to the Internet. Intel made the move, a spokesman said, 
because of the billions of dollars to be made in Internet ventures. 
Intel shares gained 1/4 to 61 3/4.

	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Hyundai Group, Korea's biggest  
conglomerate, plans to reduce the number of its subsidiaries 
drastically over the next four years and eventually plans to divide 
itself into five key businesses. The government has been 
encouraging the nation's biggest companies to focus on key 
businesses and shed peripheral operations to become more efficient 
and regain foreign investors' confidence. Hyundai said it would 
reduce the number of its subsidiaries to 26 from 79 by 2003 through 
sales and mergers.

government for approval to open an office in Riyadh, the company 
said. Foreign oil companies have been barred from exploration and 
production in the Middle East kingdom since it nationalized its oil 
industry in 1973. However, the government began seeking outside 
investment again last year in the wake of low oil prices and 
growing competition from other producers. Other companies that have 
shown interest in returning to Saudi Arabia have been Texaco Inc., 
Mobil Corp., Exxon Corp., Chevron Corp., Atlantic Richfield Co. and 
Phillips Petroleum Co.

Communications after the companies agreed to sell 18 radio stations 
in four cities to preserve competition. The department's antitrust 
division contended the original deal would have significantly 
reduced competition for radio advertising in Cleveland and Dayton, 
Ohio; Louisville, Ky.; and Tampa, Fla. With the divestiture, the 
number of competitors in those cities will either remain the same 
or increase. Clear Channel is the third largest radio group in the 
country based on number of stations, and Jacor is second.

<HEADLINE> Draft Class Debuts for Saints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The New Orleans Saints' entire draft class of  
1999 made its debut Friday when No. 34 took to the practice field 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Heisman Trophy-winning running back Ricky Williams, the first  
one-man draft in NFL history, went through his first mini-camp 
practice six days after the Saints traded their entire set of '99 
draft choices and their No. 1 and No. 3 picks next season to get 
the fifth pick in the draft and select Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first walked out here, it looked like college again  
because practice is pretty much the same everywhere,'' Williams 
said. ``But when you get out on the field, you see how much higher 
the talent level is. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking forward to being around the guys and getting to  
know them better. I had a good time. I learned a lot. I just have 
to prove to this team that I'm worth all the picks. I don't think I 
have to prove anything to anyone outside this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said he felt pretty comfortable for most of the  
practice, but graded his performance as a B-minus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have felt more comfortable,'' he said. ``It was  
different. When I felt good and comfortable and relaxed, I felt 
great. But when I tensed up and doubted things and didn't go full 
speed, I didn't feel right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and his new teammates will practice twice Saturday and  
once Sunday. They'll reconvene in early June for a second minicamp. 
Williams said he's confident he'll be under contract by the time 
training camp opens in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams weighed in at 240 pounds, about five pounds above his  
projected playing weight. He has lost approximately 20 pounds since 
his weight ballooned after the college season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to spend the next couple of months getting in better  
shape,'' Williams said. ``By training camp, I'll be where I need to 
be.''

<HEADLINE> Colo. Shooting Victim Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- John Robert Tomlin was remembered today  
as a shy teen who liked his Chevy truck, the Green Bay Packers and 
Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing John asked me when we met was whether I was  
for Ford or Chevy,'' said Jacob Youngblood, 16, one of three 
classmates who spoke at a memorial service at the Foothills Bible 
Church. ``I said Ford and that put me off his list for awhile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His was the first of many services for victims of the Columbine  
High School shooting that will be held in Colorado through the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Two screens, one on each side of the podium at the church,  
showed photos of a shy teen-ager who resisted the family's efforts 
to photograph him. All but a handful of the photos had him 
surrounded by other family members. 
</P>
<P>
	During the service, which drew about 900 people, it was hard to  
turn away from the boy's smiling face, peering down on mourners who 
almost had to shield their eyes from the dazzling glare of the sun, 
magnified on a cloudy day by 2 feet of freshly fallen snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Boxes of tissues were placed in each row, and few were left  
unused as kids, parents, friends and family hugged each other and 
cried. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomlin, who grew up in Wisconsin and moved to Colorado four and  
half years ago, was a Packers fan whose Green Bay jacket was 
displayed in the church vestibule. A friend recalled his devotion 
to religion -- he was a member of the non-denominational Christian 
church where the service was held, and a member of a Baptist youth 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	``What got John to heaven was his faith not his hard work,''  
Youngblood said. ``John, I'm on my way. You just beat me there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Bill Oudemolen set the tone, saying anger wasn't the  
right response to the violence. Instead of blaming the two teens 
accused of killing 12 fellow students and one teacher, before 
killing themselves, he pointed at the ``evil of the black 
trenchcoats,'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two alleged killers, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17,  
belonged to a small group described as outsiders, some said by 
their own choice. They wore black trenchcoats and were called ``The 
Trenchcoat Mafia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the service, John's mother, Doreen Tomlin told reporters:  
``He was such a good kid. But he was shy.'' Last summer the 
teen-ager worked as volunteer building homes for poor people in 
Juarez, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before her son turned 16 and could get his driver's  
license, she said she jokingly asked her son, ``Where do you want 
to be buried? He told her, ``Wisconsin, Mom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His body was to be buried in Wisconsin following a viewing in  
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomlin's father, John, told reporters: ``First I'd like to say  
to the families of the children who did this we'll be praying with 
them and we feel no hatred toward them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The father also didn't want to blame school administrators for  
failing to recognize that some members of the Trenchcoat group were 
a danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only system that failed is that God is left out of  
everything,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Minor League BB Team in Holy Furor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAGERSTOWN, Md. (AP) -- A minor league baseball team charged with  
religious bias responded to the complaints this way: 
</P>
<P>
	The team added a golden halo patch to the shoulder of its  
players' uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagerstown Suns owner Winston Blenckstone said Friday the halo  
acknowledges fan support for the club's disputed practice of giving 
ticket discounts to families bringing church bulletins to Sunday 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are telling us that they are proud of us for standing  
up for what they think are wholesome family values,'' Blenckstone 
said. ``Most of these people are good Christians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blenckstone announced the move Thursday as the club's lawyer  
prepared for a pre-hearing conference Friday with an American Civil 
Liberties Union lawyer representing complainant Carl Silverman. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverman, an agnostic baseball fan from nearby Waynesboro, Pa.,  
called the Suns' action ``incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added ACLU lawyer Dwight Sullivan: ``I really think it's sad  
they are using religious discrimination as a publicity gimmick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverman complained to the Maryland Commission on Human  
Relations last year after he and his two children were charged a 
total of $8, instead of the discounted group price of $6, for 
attending a Suns game without a church bulletin on Easter Sunday in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the commission charged the Suns with violating a  
state law against religious discrimination in places of public 
accommodation. The commission asked an administrative law judge to 
bar the church bulletin promotion and fine the club $500. A hearing 
is to begin June 28. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU has filed a similar complaint in federal court in  
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Blenckstone said he doesn't plan to end the 6-year-old  
promotion, sponsored by WJAL-TV of Chambersburg, Pa. He said he has 
received thousands of supportive letters from around the country 
and about $2,200 in contributions to a defense fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns, a Class A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays, have  
plenty of community support in this industrial city in the 
Appalachian foothills about 70 miles west of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Robert Bruchey has called Silverman's complaint  
``lunacy.'' Democratic state Delegate John Donoghue says it's 
``ridiculous'' because the promotion doesn't require the 
bulletin-holder to have attended church. 
</P>
<P>
	But legal experts say case law favors Silverman's argument,  
backed by the American Atheists and the Freedom From Religion 
Foundation, that the discount benefits religious people over 
nonbelievers. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverman is a veteran of church-state battles. He successfully  
protested the distribution of New Testament Bibles by The Gideons 
in Waynesboro elementary schools during school hours in 1996, and 
forced the removal of four crosses from state parkland near 
Fayetteville, Pa., last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Just this week, Silverman complained that Waynesboro public  
schools were sending fifth-graders to a Christian camp for 
environmental studies.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Spurs Entertainment Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Littleton school massacre has intensified a  
debate over whether the entertainment industry has helped create 
what some call a culture of violence with morbid computer games, 
music about death and drugs, and movies about kids who solve their 
problems with cruel mind games and murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can no longer shut our eyes to the impact that the media is  
having on all of our children and on the potentially violent impact 
it's having on some,'' first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a 
speech Thursday night in upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar sentiments have been aired this week by Vice President  
Al Gore's wife, Tipper Gore, Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, a state 
senator in Michigan and a Colorado group calling itself Hollywood 
Against Violent Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do our children have to witness before we get mad enough  
to act?'' the group said in a full-page ad Thursday in the 
Hollywood Reporter. ``Doesn't it make you wonder from where they're 
getting these violent ideas? How horrific does our entertainment 
have to become to be entertaining?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A music industry group, the Recording Industry Association of  
America, said in a statement it was ``shocked and pained'' by the 
Colorado rampage, but called blame directed at the record industry 
misguided. 
</P>
<P>
	``Music does not drive teen-agers to violent despair nor does it  
put guns and weapons in the hands of children,'' the group said. 
``It's too easy to make music a scapegoat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Mark Johnson, producer of the Oscar-winning ``Rain Man'' and  
executive producer of TV's ``L.A. Doctors,'' said ``We have to 
accept responsibility'' for ``this world in which violence is just 
like Muzak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We can no longer sit back and say: 'Come on, it's freedom of  
speech. It's not our responsibility; it's the parent's 
responsibility,'' he said. ``It's got to stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same concerns have been pondered by the public in the days  
since two teen-agers opened fire at Columbine High School on 
Tuesday, killing 13 people before taking their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
	A USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll this week showed 49 percent of  
respondents believed the popular media, including movies, 
television and music, had a ``great deal'' of blame for the 
Colorado shootings. (A larger percentage of respondents, however, 
placed blame on parents and the availability of guns.) 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-two percent said they considered restrictions on TV and  
movie violence as ``very effective'' means to help stop school 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet, meanwhile, was full of spirited responses by fans  
of the violent computer game Doom, which one of the gunmen in the 
Littleton shootings, Eric Harris, had said he liked to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doom has nothing to do with this,'' said one person on a Doom  
Web site, in a typical response. ``I enjoy making Doom more 
gruesome, I watch movies such as 'Evil Dead 2' and `Terminator 2,' 
and I listen to ... (rocker) Rob Zombie, but I don't even want to 
touch a real gun, bomb, chain saw, or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Rickard, with the Denver Police Department's gang unit,  
said emotional problems with roots in the home life -- and not 
entertainment -- appear to have the biggest influence on why 
children turn to gangs and violence. He found many youths go to 
gangs or cults seeking acceptance, a feeling of self worth and a 
sense of identity. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added: ``A lot times entertainment -- music, movies -- is  
the trigger. It's not the cause, necessarily, it's the little push 
that makes them do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that he observed in the 1970s that the violent ``Dirty  
Harry'' police movies had ``a lot of cops emulating that kind of 
attitude on the streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If a movie can affect a police officer, why can't it affect a  
kid?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood has clearly found a market in films about teen  
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	This year has already seen a number of movies with the  
high-school-is-hell theme, including ``Jawbreaker'' about members 
of a bad girl clique who accidentally kill a girl during a prank 
and ``Cruel Intentions'' about high schoolers who toy with people's 
emotions for fun. This summer, there's the black comedy ``Drop Dead 
Gorgeous'' about a teen beauty pageant plagued by a string of 
violent deaths.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened lower. The Dow Jones  
industrial average is down 44 points in today's early going. Losers 
on the New York Stock Exchange hold a 3-2 lead over gainers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is down a fraction and the S&AMP;P 500  
Index is down two points. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip sector is taking a little hit in early trading  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because shares of AT&AMP;T have been trading lower in the  
after-hours market, following a hostile bid launched by the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T is offering to buy MediaOne. And as a component of the Dow,  
any big decline in AT&AMP;T shares will be felt in the average as a

<HEADLINE> Some AOL Shareholders Cashing In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc. said several major  
shareholders, including Sprint Corp., will sell stakes valued at 
about $4.61 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint will cash out its entire AOL holding of 28.8 million  
shares, a 2.8 percent stake. The Westwood, Kan., based 
long-distance phone service provider acquired the AOL stake as 
warrants in 1993 as part of an agreement to provide network 
services to AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint purchased 450,000 shares of Dulles, Va.-based AOL, the  
largest Internet access provider and online service, for $31.25 
each. Because AOL's potential was unknown at the time, a spokesman 
for Sprint told the Wall Street Journal that the company hedged the 
transaction to lock in gains. Sprint therefore will realize a 
profit of only about $100 million. AOL's stock has had six 2-for-1 
splits since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Thursday's closing stock price of 148 11/16, the AOL  
stock would be worth $4.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The other 2.2 million shares are being sold by 31 companies and  
individuals, including investor Paul Allen, and Washington Post Co.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Holds Alliance Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Javier Solana, the Spanish socialist who once  
campaigned against NATO bases in his native country, has been a key 
figure in holding the alliance together during its greatest 
military challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	As the bombing of Yugoslavia enters its second month, the 19  
alliance members appear united in their determination to persist 
until President Slobodan Milosevic yields. 
</P>
<P>
	Though few admit it publicly, many at NATO hoped that a few days  
of bombing would be sufficient. When it wasn't, the potential for 
fracture was high. But the North Atlantic Council, the alliance 
policy-making body chaired by Solana, moved ahead with what many 
now predict will be a long air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana, 56, a former foreign minister of Spain under Prime  
Minister Felipe Gonzalez, took over at NATO in December 1995. He 
came directly from a six-month tour at the 15-nation European 
Union, where he headed the EU Council during Spain's turn at the 
rotating EU presidency and won praise for his skill at negotiation 
and compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	He took over NATO's leadership at a difficult time in the  
alliance's history. Willy Claes of Belgium had just been indicted 
for corruption for previous activities in his home country. The 
early front-runner to replace him, former Dutch Prime Minister Ruud 
Lubbers, was rejected by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana, a dapper physicist with a short salt-and-pepper beard,  
was the more than acceptable second choice. 
</P>
<P>
	He is popular among the ambassadors who make up the North  
Atlantic Council and has the support of the White House. And while 
grumbling is frequently heard among diplomats about the NATO staff 
in Brussels, it rarely includes Solana. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is an extraordinary consensus-builder who works behind the  
scenes with leaders on both sides of the Atlantic to ensure that 
NATO is united when it counts,'' said Alexander Vershbow, the 
American ambassador to NATO. ``A good example is Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noted Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen: ``He has been  
most effective and has made an enormous contribution'' to 
maintaining alliance cohesion. ``The way he put together the 
upgrading of all options was excellent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solana took over the same day that NATO led 60,000 troops from  
30 nations into Bosnia to implement the Dayton peace agreement. 
That operation is continuing, though at a lower level with about 
30,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Kosovo crisis, the allies gave Solana latitude in  
moving from Phase I of the bombing campaign in Yugoslavia to a more 
intense Phase II, requiring only informal consultation. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana holds a doctorate in physics. He was a Fulbright scholar  
at several American universities and taught solid-state physics at 
Madrid's Complutense University. He joined the Spanish Socialist 
Party in 1964 and was elected a member of Parliament in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of an illustrious Spanish family, Solana moved from the  
antimilitarism and radicalism of his student days in the early 
1960s under the regime of Gen. Francisco Franco to foreign minister 
of a staunchly pro-NATO government in Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana, who served in the Spanish Cabinet from 1982-95, says his  
early attitudes opposing American bases in Spain came from his 
student years in the United States during the unrest over Vietnam 
and civil rights. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> 49ers Backup QB Faces Rape Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Jim Druckenmiller's already uncertain  
future with the San Francisco 49ers took a disturbing turn Friday 
when the backup quarterback was indicted on a rape charge. 
Druckenmiller denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge against Druckenmiller, a 1997 first-round pick out of  
Virginia Tech, comes at a time when his standing with the team is 
at a low. General manager Bill Walsh trashed his football skills 
two weeks ago and last week implied he would have been released by 
now but for salary cap ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller took part Friday in the opening of the team's  
three-day mini camp and coach Steve Mariucci said he would be 
permitted to continue practicing with the team while the criminal 
case goes through the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, he's still a member of this football team,''  
Mariucci said. ``He's going to be evaluated based on his 
performance on the football field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said Druckenmiller met with him Thursday to inform him  
about the criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've discussed it briefly,'' Mariucci said. ``Neither one of  
us can really say much of anything at all regarding this issue, but 
he explained his side to me and as you know there are two sides to 
every story. Hopefully, this will all be resolved soon. We'll let 
the legal system progress as it normally would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller is accused of assaulting a Virginia Tech student  
in early March when he returned to Blacksburg, Va., for a visit. 
The indictment was unsealed Friday by the order of a Montgomery 
County judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the team's workout, Druckenmiller declined to comment  
in any detail on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very confident I'll be available for this season,'' he  
said. ``I do believe justice will prevail. My teammates have been 
more than supportive. We've got a minicamp here and we're working 
on football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He referred other questions to his lawyer, David Neufeld, who in  
a statement described Druckenmiller as the victim in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Neufeld said Druckenmiller had been aggressively pursued by his  
accuser and claims the two later had consensual sex. He also said 
Druckenmiller took and passed a polygraph test. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the obvious anguish caused by the false charges, Jim  
is confident and finds some comfort in knowing that he will be 
fully vindicated,'' Neufeld said. '' ... He stands ready to 
vigorously defend his innocence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one-paragraph indictment provides no details of the crime,  
saying only that Druckenmiller had sex with the woman ``against her 
will, by force or through the use of physical helplessness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors declined to say whether alcohol was involved in the  
woman's condition of helplessness. Druckenmiller is not accused of 
using threats or intimidation to have sex with the woman. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of rape, Druckenmiller could face five years to  
life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Under NFL policy, any player charged with a violent crime is  
required to undergo immediate clinical evaluation and counseling. 
Conviction or admitting to a violent crime could bring suspension 
without pay by the league or a fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Druckenmiller said he wasn't aware of Walsh's recent  
criticism and insisted he had a good relationship with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh had mocked Druckenmiller's reputation as a strong-armed  
quarterback, saying touch and nimbleness in the pocket were more 
important in the 49ers' West Coast scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, after seeing a quarterback workout, Walsh  
described Druckenmiller's throwing as spotty and erratic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've stopped reading the media,'' Druckenmiller said. ``I just  
haven't been doing that and I haven't heard anything verbatim. I'd 
like to hear it myself. When me and Bill have talked, it's been 
very positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling good. I'm out there playing and competing. I think  
I've been throwing the ball well.''

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Cos. Plan New Marketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The smoke in bars may get thicker now that  
tobacco companies have had to remove their billboard advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco companies that have been spending an estimated $150  
million a year on outdoor advertising are expected to boost 
spending on promotions in bars, sweepstakes, store displays and 
magazines, including those they invent. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are very agile,'' Ned Levine, who heads the marketing  
firm Firebrand LLC in Providence, R.I., said of the tobacco 
companies. ``There are plenty of ways for them to make 
impressions'' without billboards. 
</P>
<P>
	The major tobacco companies agreed to quit advertising on  
billboards as part of last fall's $206 billion settlement of 
lawsuits by 46 states seeking reimbursement for what they were 
spending on treating sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	The billboard ban took effect Friday and as part of the deal,  
states had a chance to use the billboards for messages discouraging 
smoking until the tobacco company leases on the space run out. 
</P>
<P>
	But marketing experts said the industry has prospered despite  
restrictions that saw cigarette ads vanish from TV and radio in the 
early 1970s and, more recently, drove smokers out of their offices 
and public spaces to puff by the curbsides. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies won't be specific about their plans, saying they  
don't want to tip off their rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are any number of responsible ways to effectively market  
our products to adults who choose to smoke,'' said Ellen Merlo, a 
spokeswoman for Philip Morris USA, the nation's biggest tobacco 
company and the maker of the top selling cigarette brand Marlboro. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the alternatives expected to draw increased support are  
bar programs in which tobacco companies help a bar owner pay to 
stage special events like live music, fashion shows, magic acts and 
photography exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, the sponsor gets exclusive advertising privileges  
in the bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Under its program, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. supplies the bars  
with napkins and matches with the Camel name, and has workers on 
hand ready to swap a pack of Camels for other brands, said Reynolds 
spokeswoman Carole Crosslin. Reynolds is the nation's second 
biggest tobacco company. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its bar program, Philip Morris encourage customers to  
sign up for its ``Marlboro Party at the Ranch'' sweepstakes under 
which 2,000 people have won five-day trips since last fall to one 
of three ranches the company owns in Montana and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., the third biggest U.S. tobacco  
company, spends about $30 million a year on its bar programs for 
its Kool and Lucky Strike brands, said spokesman Mark Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco companies like the programs because bars don't allow  
in minors, and means that the bar crowd is old enough to smoke 
legally. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco companies are also expected to spend more money in the  
stores where cigarettes are sold to put up signs and get better 
displays for their brands. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement's ban on billboards exempted signs smaller than  
14 square feet on stores that sell cigarettes as well as displays 
inside the stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Myers, a lawyer for the advocacy group Campaign for  
Tobacco-Free Kids, said that could lead to even more tobacco 
advertising on the sides of stores in inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
	And Bill Kline, a lawyer for the Tobacco Control Resource Center  
at Northeastern University, said he expects to see more cigarette 
signs at the counter -- where children will see them. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to entice them to think of smoking as the normal  
thing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco companies will also spend more to get preferred shelf  
space inside stores, said tobacco analyst David Adelman of Morgan 
Stanley Dean Witter. 
</P>
<P>
	Magazines could benefit from the billboard ban by getting more  
tobacco advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco advertisers spent $324.6 million on magazine  
advertisements in 1998, twice as much as the $152.9 million spent 
on outdoor advertising, according to Competitive Media Reporting, 
which tracks ad spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the three biggest tobacco companies already publish their  
own lifestyle magazines that are sent free to people in their 
databases. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris has been publishing the quarterly magazine  
``Unlimited'' for about two years. Merlo declined to say how many 
people get it. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown &AMP; Williamson launched the magazine ``Real Edge'' earlier  
this year. It is aimed mainly at men and was sent to 1 million 
smokers. The company is also testing a magazine for women called 
``Flair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real wise use of advertising dollars,'' said Smith.  
``We are reaching known smokers. We know they are adults. And we 
know they want to receive this information.''

<HEADLINE> Cable-Car Charges Remain for Pilot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A judge today refused to dismiss  
obstruction of justice charges against a Marine pilot whose jet 
clipped an Italian gondola cable, killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, Col. Alvin Keller, rejected arguments by Capt.  
Richard Ashby's lawyers that high-ranking Marine officers 
improperly influenced the decision to prosecute Ashby on 
obstruction and conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection starts Monday for Ashby's trial, which is  
expected to last two weeks. The charges he faces carry a maximum 10 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is accused of destroying a  
videotape shot during the February 1998 flight. He admitted taking 
the videotape out of his EA-6B Prowler after landing at his base in 
Aviano, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	During a low-level training mission, Ashby's four-man jet  
clipped the gondola, sending 20 people to their deaths. Ashby was 
acquitted of manslaughter charges in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby had testified that he handed the videotape to his  
navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, who then threw the tape into a 
bonfire. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., pleaded guilty to obstruction  
charges, and a judge recommended his dismissal from the Marines.

<HEADLINE> Stock Prices Narrowly Mixed / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were narrowly mixed today in  
profit-taking following Wall Street's three-day rally. Concerns 
about AT&AMP;T's bid for cable operator MediaOne weighed on the Dow 
Jones industrials. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m., the Dow was up 1.15 at 10,728.33 after falling as  
much as 80 points earlier. The blue chips rose 145 points Thursday 
to 10,727.18, their 10th record high close in 14 sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indexes were moderately higher. The Nasdaq  
composite was up 28.36 at 2,589.97, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 
was up 0.50 at 1,359.32. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is certainly overdue for a pause to refresh,'' said  
Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; 
Sons Inc. in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even bull markets have to rest their engines,'' he said.  
``That's all today is -- a chance to catch our breath and look at 
how strong this market has been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, a Dow component, fell after news of its $58 billion  
hostile bid for MediaOne, the nation's fourth-largest cable 
operator. AT&AMP;T is trying to thwart a merger agreement reached last 
month between MediaOne and No. 3 cable television company Comcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors worry that the deal could hurt AT&AMP;T's earnings.  
</P>
<P>
	``This deal spooks the market a little bit because AT&AMP;T has been  
one of the better performing stocks and there is concern about how 
this will affect it,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief investment 
strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co., in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think fundamentally this positions AT&AMP;T tremendously for the  
longer term,'' he said. ``Today, we are seeing a knee-jerk 
reaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T was down 3 3/16 at 52 15/16. MediaOne was up 7 5/8 at 77 1/8.  
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks turned higher after a weak morning that saw  
profit-taking from three days of big gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues narrowed their lead on advancers to 1,466 to  
1,394 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 518.74 
million shares, up from Thursday's pace.

	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A prosecutor asked for DNA samples from 12  
Guatemalan soldiers today, one of the first signs that the 
military's possible involvement in the slaying of a human rights 
crusader a year ago is being seriously investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	Roman Catholic Bishop Juan Gerardi was bludgeoned to death April  
26, two days after presenting a report blaming the military and 
pro-government death squads for most of the human rights violations 
during Guatemala's 36-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	In the year since his death, prosecutors focused their  
investigations almost exclusively on a parish priest who lived at 
the house, even as rights activists accused them of ignoring 
possible evidence of military involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Just days before the first anniversary of the killing,  
prosecutor Celvin Galindo asked the judge in the case to order the 
samples and testing of 12 soldiers, four army employees and 
civilians, including the priest, Mario Orantes. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Flor de Maria Garcia Villatoro must still rule on the  
prosecution's request. Court documents did not list the soldiers' 
ranks.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A student-led strike that has crippled  
Mexico's largest university threatens to indefinitely suspend much 
of the nation's scientific research, a prominent researcher said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike illustrated the vulnerability of Mexico's fledgling  
research efforts, many of which are based at the sprawling, 
268,000-student National Autonomous University, or UNAM, one of the 
world's largest universities. 
</P>
<P>
	Students shut down the UNAM's campuses and research centers  
Tuesday to protest a tuition hike and other unpopular measures 
implemented by UNAM President Francisco Barnes de Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	Francisco Bolivar Zapata, UNAM's coordinator for scientific  
research, warned that 4,000 research projects -- about 40 percent of 
the nation's college research -- could be seriously affected by the 
strike, the government news agency Notimex reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers warned laboratory animals could die, or infect each  
other with diseases, and scientific instruments in many cases go 
unmonitored. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the university-affiliated National Disaster Prevention  
Center, which monitors activity at the nearby Popocatepetl volcano, 
has continued to function since the strike began Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Feds Give Shooting Victims $1.5M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government will make up to $1.5  
million available to the Columbine High School shooting victims to 
pay for funerals, uninsured medical expenses, lost wages, 
counseling and such, President Clinton said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, will travel to  
Littleton, Colo., on Sunday for an afternoon memorial service 
remembering the teacher and 12 students shot and killed before the 
two students suspected in the attack killed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The president will remain in Washington, where he is  
participating in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the NATO 
alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief statement before opening the political summit,  
Clinton said the money will ``help the communities assist the 
victims in their long journey toward recovery.'' It will be drawn 
from the Justice Department's Crime Victims Trust Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The president added that ``we will do more,'' and he proceeded  
to remind school officials across the country of federal programs 
aimed at preventing violent eruptions of rage. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said early-warning guides sent to 200,000 schools in  
August will be reprinted and distributed next week to 150,000 
additional schools. He also alerted schools that they have until 
the end of this month to apply for a portion of the $17 million 
available for school-crime prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Local communities have until June 1 to apply for $180 million in  
Safe Schools-Healthy Students grants, a federal anti-violence and 
anti-drug-abuse initiative developed after the White House 
conference on school safety last October. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department also is providing, as part of an existing  
grant program, $70 million to station 600 police officers for 
school security in 336 communities around the country.

<HEADLINE>  Colo. Shooting Victim Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- John Robert Tomlin was remembered today  
as a shy teen who liked his Chevy truck, the Green Bay Packers and 
Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing John asked me when we met was whether I was  
for Ford or Chevy,'' said Jacob Youngblood, 16, one of three 
classmates who spoke at a memorial service at the Foothills Bible 
Church. ``I said Ford and that put me off his list for awhile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His was the first of many services for victims of the Columbine  
High School shooting that will be held in Colorado through the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Two screens, one on each side of the podium at the church,  
showed photos of a shy teen-ager who resisted the family's efforts 
to photograph him. All but a handful of the photos had him 
surrounded by other family members. 
</P>
<P>
	During the service, which drew about 900 people, it was hard to  
turn away from the boy's smiling face, peering down on mourners who 
almost had to shield their eyes from the dazzling glare of the sun, 
magnified on a cloudy day by 2 feet of freshly fallen snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Boxes of tissues were placed in each row, and few were left  
unused as kids, parents, friends and family hugged each other and 
cried. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomlin, who grew up in Wisconsin and moved to Colorado four and  
half years ago, was a Packers fan whose Green Bay jacket was 
displayed in the church vestibule. A friend recalled his devotion 
to religion -- he was a member of the non-denominational Christian 
church where the service was held, and a member of a Baptist youth 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	``What got John to heaven was his faith not his hard work,''  
Youngblood said. ``John, I'm on my way. You just beat me there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Bill Oudemolen set the tone, saying anger wasn't the  
right response to the violence. Instead of blaming the two teens 
accused of killing 12 fellow students and one teacher, before 
killing themselves, he pointed at the ``evil of the black 
trenchcoats,'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two alleged killers, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17,  
belonged to a small group described as outsiders, some said by 
their own choice. They wore black trenchcoats and were called ``The 
Trenchcoat Mafia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the service, John's mother, Doreen Tomlin told reporters:  
``He was such a good kid. But he was shy.'' Last summer the 
teen-ager worked as volunteer building homes for poor people in 
Juarez, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before her son turned 16 and could get his driver's  
license, she said she jokingly asked her son, ``Where do you want 
to be buried? He told her, ``Wisconsin, Mom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His body was to be buried in Wisconsin following a viewing in  
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomlin's father, John, told reporters: ``First I'd like to say  
to the families of the children who did this we'll be praying with 
them and we feel no hatred toward them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The father also didn't want to blame school administrators for  
failing to recognize that some members of the Trenchcoat group were 
a danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only system that failed is that God is left out of  
everything,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Colo. Shooting Victim Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- John Robert Tomlin was remembered today  
as a shy teen who liked his Chevy truck, the Green Bay Packers and 
Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing John asked me when we met was whether I was  
for Ford or Chevy,'' said Jacob Youngblood, 16, one of three 
classmates who spoke at a memorial service at the Foothills Bible 
Church. ``I said Ford and that put me off his list for awhile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His was the first of many services for victims of the Columbine  
High School shooting that will be held in Colorado through the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Two screens, one on each side of the podium at the church,  
showed photos of a shy teen-ager who resisted the family's efforts 
to photograph him. All but a handful of the photos had him 
surrounded by other family members. 
</P>
<P>
	During the service, which drew about 900 people, it was hard to  
turn away from the boy's smiling face, peering down on mourners who 
almost had to shield their eyes from the dazzling glare of the sun, 
magnified on a cloudy day by 2 feet of freshly fallen snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Boxes of tissues were placed in each row, and few were left  
unused as kids, parents, friends and family hugged each other and 
cried. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomlin, who grew up in Wisconsin and moved to Colorado four and  
half years ago, was a Packers fan whose Green Bay jacket was 
displayed in the church vestibule. A friend recalled his devotion 
to religion -- he was a member of the non-denominational Christian 
church where the service was held, and a member of a Baptist youth 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	``What got John to heaven was his faith not his hard work,''  
Youngblood said. ``John, I'm on my way. You just beat me there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Bill Oudemolen set the tone, saying anger wasn't the  
right response to the violence. Instead of blaming the two teens 
accused of killing 12 fellow students and one teacher, before 
killing themselves, he pointed at the ``evil of the black 
trenchcoats,'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two alleged killers, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17,  
belonged to a small group described as outsiders, some said by 
their own choice. They wore black trenchcoats and were called ``The 
Trenchcoat Mafia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the service, John's mother, Doreen Tomlin told reporters:  
``He was such a good kid. But he was shy.'' Last summer the 
teen-ager worked as volunteer building homes for poor people in 
Juarez, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before her son turned 16 and could get his driver's  
license, she said she jokingly asked her son, ``Where do you want 
to be buried? He told her, ``Wisconsin, Mom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His body was to be buried in Wisconsin following a viewing in  
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomlin's father, John, told reporters: ``First I'd like to say  
to the families of the children who did this we'll be praying with 
them and we feel no hatred toward them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The father also didn't want to blame school administrators for  
failing to recognize that some members of the Trenchcoat group were 
a danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only system that failed is that God is left out of  
everything,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Philly To March for Cop Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Just blocks from the street corner where  
Mumia Abu-Jamal was arrested 18 years ago next to the body of a 
slain policeman, officers will have to provide security Saturday 
when supporters of the convicted killer rally for his freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	``The irony of all this is that we're providing for the safety  
of their demonstration in support of a person convicted of killing 
an officer,'' said police Capt. Linda MacLachlin. ``I've talked 
with a number of friends on the force. It's not my place to say 
exactly what they've told me, but there's a lot of emotional issues 
to deal with here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they have no way of knowing how many people will  
attend, but they have spent the week training for the thousands 
that organizers say will be here ``to shut down this city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what, I still believe we're helping defend the right  
to celebrate a murder,'' said Richard Costello, president of the 
Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police. ``And here we see that a 
lie repeated often enough and financially backed up can sell and 
dupe a lot of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal, a former radio journalist and Black Panther, was  
convicted in 1982 of murdering Officer Daniel Faulkner and was 
sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulkner, 25, had stopped Abu-Jamal's brother for a traffic  
violation in 1981 and, police say, Abu-Jamal happened on the scene 
and shot the police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal is seeking a new trial, arguing that the prosecution  
withheld evidence, the judge was biased, blacks were kept off the 
jury, witnesses were unduly influenced and his defense was 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters have rallied around Abu-Jamal and made him a symbol  
of opposition to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said we wanted to shut down this city. In fact, we want the  
world to stop and take notice of a government in conspiracy,'' said 
Pam Africa, who heads the International Concerned Friends and 
Family of Mumia Abu-Jamal. ``Mumia Abu-Jamal didn't get a fair 
trial, and we are protesting that injustice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters are expected to march from three sections of  
Philadelphia to City Hall during the daylong event, which falls on 
Abu-Jamal's 45th birthday. A rally also is planned Saturday in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	With the recent outcry over police shootings of unarmed blacks  
in New York and Philadelphia, officers are prepared to deal with 
racial tensions and hostility toward the police. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people may want to vent their frustrations on the  
police officers there,'' Deputy Police Commissioner Robert Mitchell 
said. ``We have to let them. We need to try to remain as 
emotionally detached as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officers assigned to the march have been given a four-hour  
training session that included civil rights instruction and 
reminders about how to use police shields and chemical spray. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are professional people. That will be foremost in our minds  
at the rally, but we also appear to be the last group in American 
society still politically acceptable to smear and celebrate the 
murder of,'' Costello said. ``If they're trying to shut down the 
city the situation we have now is a thinly veiled threat of 
violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A similar event in Philadelphia in 1995 drew about 15,000; other  
rallies have drawn far fewer people than organizers expected. 
</P>
<P>
	To draw attention away from the rally, the organization Justice  
for Police Officer Daniel Faulkner planned a dinner Friday night in 
Faulkner's memory. More than 800 people bought the $100 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Enough.' I have become convinced that the whole  
situation has become an international debacle and people have 
become incredibly misled by all the pro-Mumia rhetoric out there,'' 
said Michael Smerconish, an organizer of the nonprofit group.

<HEADLINE> Minor League BB Team in Holy Furor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAGERSTOWN, Md. (AP) -- A minor league baseball team charged with  
religious bias responded to the complaints this way: 
</P>
<P>
	The team added a golden halo patch to the shoulder of its  
players' uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagerstown Suns owner Winston Blenckstone said Friday the halo  
acknowledges fan support for the club's disputed practice of giving 
ticket discounts to families bringing church bulletins to Sunday 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are telling us that they are proud of us for standing  
up for what they think are wholesome family values,'' Blenckstone 
said. ``Most of these people are good Christians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blenckstone announced the move Thursday as the club's lawyer  
prepared for a pre-hearing conference Friday with an American Civil 
Liberties Union lawyer representing complainant Carl Silverman. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverman, an agnostic baseball fan from nearby Waynesboro, Pa.,  
called the Suns' action ``incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added ACLU lawyer Dwight Sullivan: ``I really think it's sad  
they are using religious discrimination as a publicity gimmick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverman complained to the Maryland Commission on Human  
Relations last year after he and his two children were charged a 
total of $8, instead of the discounted group price of $6, for 
attending a Suns game without a church bulletin on Easter Sunday in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the commission charged the Suns with violating a  
state law against religious discrimination in places of public 
accommodation. The commission asked an administrative law judge to 
bar the church bulletin promotion and fine the club $500. A hearing 
is to begin June 28. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU has filed a similar complaint in federal court in  
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Blenckstone said he doesn't plan to end the 6-year-old  
promotion, sponsored by WJAL-TV of Chambersburg, Pa. He said he has 
received thousands of supportive letters from around the country 
and about $2,200 in contributions to a defense fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns, a Class A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays, have  
plenty of community support in this industrial city in the 
Appalachian foothills about 70 miles west of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Robert Bruchey has called Silverman's complaint  
``lunacy.'' Democratic state Delegate John Donoghue says it's 
``ridiculous'' because the promotion doesn't require the 
bulletin-holder to have attended church. 
</P>
<P>
	But legal experts say case law favors Silverman's argument,  
backed by the American Atheists and the Freedom From Religion 
Foundation, that the discount benefits religious people over 
nonbelievers. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverman is a veteran of church-state battles. He successfully  
protested the distribution of New Testament Bibles by The Gideons 
in Waynesboro elementary schools during school hours in 1996, and 
forced the removal of four crosses from state parkland near 
Fayetteville, Pa., last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Just this week, Silverman complained that Waynesboro public  
schools were sending fifth-graders to a Christian camp for 
environmental studies.

<HEADLINE> Politics Hamper Big Telecom Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Obstacles keep popping up to the proposed merger  
of the German and Italian telecommunications titans. Analysts say 
that if the deal between Deutsche Telecom and Telecom Italia goes 
through, the companies will face cultural differences, an unwieldy 
management structure and skeptical investors. 
</P>
<P>
	But first, the planned $80 billion combination must overcome  
challenges that could keep it from happening. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian ministers are turning up the heat on the German  
government to guarantee it will slash its majority stake in 
Deutsche Telekom. And France Telecom is making waves about the 
expansion plans of its longtime partner in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	One day after Telecom Italia and Deutsche Telekom disclosed  
details of the largest merger ever attempted in Europe, the deal's 
prospects seemed very much in question Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say it's a 50-50 chance,'' said Robin Bosworth of  
Schema Ltd., a London-based consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian officials from the prime minister on down have expressed  
hope that Telecom Italia, a former state-owned monopoly, will 
remain in Italian hands. Of particular concern is the German 
government's 72 percent stake in Deutsche Telekom. 
</P>
<P>
	The German Finance Ministry last week assured the Italian  
Treasury that it would not interfere with the merged company's 
operations and structure, but the Italians are unconvinced. Italy's 
Finance Minister Vincenzo Visco insisted Friday that the German 
government guarantee that it will reduce its stake -- and share 
control of the new company on an equal basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the merger agreement, Deutsche Telekom would control about  
56 percent of the new company, and the German government would own 
40 percent of its stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian Communications Minister Salvatore Cardinale said the  
Germans must give ``clear, precise and rapid signals'' about when 
it will sell off its stake in Deutsche Telekom and how the two 
governments will share equal control of the new business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that the Italians are being unreasonable,'' said  
Robert Grindle, an industry analyst at HSBC in London. ``They are 
in an unequal position because they've been more progressive in 
privatizing the former state-owned phone company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian government owns just 3.4 percent of Telecom Italia,  
although it has veto power over major decisions like mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	A rival bid for Telecom Italia by its smaller Italian rival,  
Olivetti, is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The German-Italian merger has already angered one of Deutsche  
Telekom's oldest partners, France Telecom. The French company has 
accused Deutsche Telekom of violating its previous commitments and 
said it will take action to protect its shareholders' interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom have reciprocal 2 percent  
shareholdings, and together with Sprint Corp. of the United States, 
they own the Global One joint telecom venture. 
</P>
<P>
	London-based analyst Bosworth said France Telecom poses a  
diplomatic challenge for the German company because their 
partnership was born in part out of a desire by politicians to form 
a strong Franco-German business relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia chief executive Franco Bernabe and his German  
counterpart Ron Sommer have played down the potential difficulties 
of the merger. The co-chiefs of the new company seem to have a good 
personal chemistry, but they are planning on a kind of dual 
management that has a poor record of success elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernabe and Sommer will need to make tough choices about where  
to cut costs and invest -- decisions that will be of great interest 
to their respective governments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would make more operational and commercial sense to have a  
single chief in the long run,'' Bosworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders in the merger partners have been unenthused.  
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, Deutsche Telekom's shares fell 2.2 percent after the  
deal was unveiled Thursday and dropped another 0.3 percent on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia fell 1.3 percent on Thursday, but bounced back  
1.6 percent Friday as some bet that the deal might fall through. 
Olivetti shares have been rising.

<HEADLINE> FBI Claims INS Worker Took Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal employee with the power to award  
political asylum to foreigners has been charged with taking bribes 
from Albanians seeking to stay in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	John Shandorf, one of eight supervisors for the Asylum Division  
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, was charged with 
conspiracy and accepting bribes, according to the FBI and the INS. 
</P>
<P>
	Shandorf was arrested at his office April 8 and is free on bail.  
He did not return a telephone message seeking comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI Special Agent Daniel Lyons said Shandorf accepted between  
$500 and several thousand dollars from at least 30 foreigners, and 
then either approved their asylum applications himself, oversaw a 
subordinate who did so, or overturned someone else's denial of an 
application. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two other unidentified people also have been charged in  
connection with the scheme, the FBI said. One individual pleaded 
guilty to bribery of a public official and another was arrested for 
conspiracy to influence, obstruct and impede a governmental 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear whether the people accused of funneling the  
bogus asylum applications to Shandorf worked for the INS. Both are 
cooperating with the ongoing federal investigation, according to 
court papers.

<HEADLINE> Organ Implanted After Being Trashed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VALHALLA, N.Y. (AP) -- State health officials were investigating  
the failure of a kidney transplanted into a 67-year-old man that 
the surgeon admits spent 90 minutes languishing in a recycling bin 
prior to the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	The kidney had to be removed Thursday from the patient, two days  
after it was implanted, because there was no blood flowing in or 
out of the organ. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had any doubt at all, I wouldn't have used it,'' said Dr.  
Khalid Butt, who performed the operation at Westchester Medical 
Center. ``The kidney in its package was intact. It would have been 
a waste not to use this priceless resource.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the medical center and the state Health Department are  
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly this is an extraordinary event that should not have  
occurred,'' said Kristine Smith, a spokesman for the state agency. 
``Our job will be to investigate and discover what exactly happened 
that led to this result and what if any changes need to be made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butt's transplant team was about to administer anesthesia to the  
patient when the surgery was delayed because the kidney, which came 
from a cadaver, was missing. 
</P>
<P>
	It had been in the operating room, on ice, wrapped in four  
layers of plastic inside a polystyrene box and a cardboard 
container labeled ``Organ/Tissue for Transplant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But someone had assumed the box was empty and placed it in a  
recycling bin, the hospital said. Ninety minutes ticked by as the 
hospital was searched. 
</P>
<P>
	A kidney from a cadaver can be preserved on ice for about 48  
hours, and 36 of those hours had already passed. 
</P>
<P>
	The patient was told there'd be a delay; he wasn't told why.  
Finally, the kidney was found, inspected and implanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Butt said he was confident -- ``10 on a scale of 1 to 10'' -- that  
the misplacing of the kidney and the delay it caused had nothing to 
do with its eventual failure. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that because the kidney failed quickly, the patient  
might not lose his place on the waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
	The patient's daughter, Gloria Kocal, said she was told her  
father would now return to dialysis treatment. She said he may have 
reservations about undergoing a third operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if my father wants to re-put his name on the list  
after all he went through,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital would not give the patient's condition, but Butt  
said he would be fine.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Prosecutor Speaks Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- District Attorney Dave Thomas stepped in  
front of the cameras today just as he had every morning, a 
prosecutor delivering cool updates about the school shooting 
investigation. But when his mouth opened, a different person spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, it was Dave Thomas, citizen, father of two Columbine  
High graduates, human being anguished about the bloodshed he had 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Thomas found a nationwide bully pulpit and used it to issue  
a demand to the nation: that the violence come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	He said America isn't taking care of its children. He wondered  
aloud about video games, movies, Dungeons &AMP; Dragons and how they 
influenced young people. And he urged everyone -- the media and the 
public -- to join him. 
</P>
<P>
	``These deaths cannot be in vain. We cannot walk away from here  
and wait for the next incident to occur,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For 20 minutes, the 50-year-old career law-enforcement officer  
held court before a live national audience, trying to understand 
why 14 young people and a teacher died violently inside a high 
school that graduated his own children, Justin and Carrie. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has to be some meaning to this,'' Thomas said.  
</P>
<P>
	He produced no good answers -- and admitted it. He even  
acknowledged that his emotion might be jarring. ``I'm not a 
zealot,'' he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not an important person,'' he said. ``I'm not the  
president. I'm not the attorney general. I'm not even the attorney 
general of Colorado. I'm just a person who's very very concerned 
about the deaths of these people. And I want to do something about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, a sedate man with a thin, angular face and tousled gray  
hair and mustache, has spent his entire life in Jefferson County. 
He worked his way up as a Denver prosecutor and an assistant U.S. 
attorney. He became Colorado's head of public safety in 1987, but 
returned to this Denver suburb in 1992 to become the district 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you saw today was the real Dave Thomas,'' said Bob Grant,  
Thomas' counterpart in Adams County, another collection of 
Denver-area suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think that we get numbed to it,'' Grant said. ``Some of  
us have seen a lot of man's inhumanity to man over the years. But 
you never get numbed. No matter how many autopsies you attend, no 
matter how many multiple homicide cases you're involved in, you 
never lose the sense of humanity if you're going to do the job 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Cohen, a Denver attorney and legal analyst, praised  
Thomas' candor and courage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thomas' remarks were more philosophical and emotional than  
we're used to hearing from our politicians and prosecutors,'' Cohen 
said. Thomas' feelings simply reflected his constituency. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's being honest when he says he doesn't have the answers,  
because none of us do,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	But that didn't stop Thomas from trying.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want my community ... to be remembered forever as the  
place where that terrible tragedy occurred,'' Thomas said. ``I want 
it to be remembered as the place where we started to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis, the other  
voice of the investigation, said he is having trouble sleeping. And 
virtually every SWAT team member and investigator is haunted by 
what they have seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough for them to go in there and see where 15 kids have  
lost their lives,'' Davis said, ``especially when they have kids of 
their own.''

<HEADLINE> Reds Owner Marge Scott Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Marge Schott, who is selling most of her  
shares in the Cincinnati Reds, was hospitalized today after 
complaining of breathing problems blamed on allergies. 
</P>
<P>
	The 70-year-old Schott went to The Jewish Hospital on her own  
early today and is in stable condition, spokeswoman Stephanie 
Savicki said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott likely will be released on Saturday, according to  
Savicki. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems were blamed on severe, seasonal pollen allergies,  
the hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott said Tuesday that she had reached a deal to sell most of  
her shares in the Reds. The deal still needs approval from owners.

<HEADLINE> Lab Director Speaks Out on Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite security concerns, scientists at  
federal weapons labs must be allowed freedom to exchange ideas 
within the scientific community, the director of the Los Alamos 
National Laboratory said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The laboratory in New Mexico has been the focus of an espionage  
investigation following allegations that China may have stolen 
information from the lab about a critical nuclear warhead in the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of Congress have criticized the open ``campus-like  
atmosphere'' at the 47-square-mile Los Alamos facility, one of the 
government's top-secret weapons research labs. It is managed by the 
University of California. 
</P>
<P>
	But John C. Browne, who became director at Los Alamos in 1997,  
said his scientists ``know how to draw the line'' when talking to 
outsiders and should be given some leeway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a campus. It's a campus behind a fence,'' said Browne  
during a hour-long meeting with reporters. ``We can't just put 
everybody behind a fence and lock them up and let them do their 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Browne said members of a congressional intelligence panel raised  
concerns about scientific freedom during a recent visit to Los 
Alamos. ``They left better informed, but not convinced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional critics have said security at Los Alamos and other  
national weapons labs has been insufficient for years, with 
adequate attention placed only recently on improving 
counterintelligence activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Browne said he didn't ``want to defend what was going on 10 to  
20 years ago.'' Still, when he first learned that China likely 
obtained information about a key nuclear warhead, the W88, from Los 
Alamos he found it hard to believe. It felt ``like a hole in the 
pit of your stomach,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he's still not convinced that a Los Alamos computer  
scientist, who has been the target of an FBI investigation for 
three years, gave the Chinese the W88 information. The scientist 
has not been charged, but was fired for security violations earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still not clear from what I read whether our guy was the  
guy that did this,'' said Browne. 
</P>
<P>
	Browne said the computer age has brought new security concerns  
because most top-secret documents now are on computers and not on 
paper, and communications in and out of the lab is largely by 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Energy Department's direction, the lab has tightened  
security on its 20,000 computers, about 3,000 of which are used for 
classified work. 
</P>
<P>
	He said additional firewalls have been established separating  
classified and unclassified computer systems and workers' 
electronic mail is being monitored. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to demonstrate to people that the lab ... can be  
trusted. The thing that hits me most is a feeling that the country 
no longer trusts Los Alamos,'' said Browne.

<HEADLINE> Schools Act Against Copycat Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A wave of threats copycatting the Columbine High School  
shootings in Colorado have driven hundreds of students from schools 
across the country and led to multiple arrests, law officers say. 
</P>
<P>
	In south-central Washington state, a high school student in  
Prosser was arrested for investigation of threatening to blow up 
his school. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-year-old allegedly told another student that he ``would  
like to position ... anti-personnel mines in every class, set them 
off simultaneously and kill everyone in the school,'' according to 
documents filed Thursday in Benton County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers searched the suspect's home but did not find any bombs  
or bomb-making materials, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Palmdale, Calif., two high school students who made  
references to the ``Trenchcoat Mafia'' were arrested Thursday after 
one threatened another student and the other talked about 
bomb-making, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the students allegedly told a girl that he thought the  
Littleton, Colo., attack -- which left 12 students, a teacher and 
the two teen-age gunmen dead -- was funny. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told her that if he ever began to act crazy like the two  
killers in Colorado, she would be the first that he would kill,'' 
said sheriff's Deputy Steve Owen. 
</P>
<P>
	Trench coats like the ones worn by the two gunmen have been  
banned in Denver and some other Colorado districts since the attack 
for fear they could be used to hide weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Three teen-agers in Cherry Hill, N.J., were suspended from their  
high school for 10 days for standing in a hallway Thursday clad in 
black trench coats and pantomiming gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will take tough discipline against anyone showing bad  
judgment, serious or not,'' said Superintendent Morton Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents in The Colony, northwest of Dallas, took more than 200  
children home Thursday from a middle school after hearing rumors 
about a 14-year-old's alleged threat to shoot a classmate. 
</P>
<P>
	The same day, threatening graffiti inside a Wylie, Texas, school  
cafeteria resulted in a search by bomb-sniffing dogs. About 450 of 
the school's 600 students went home, even though nothing was found. 
</P>
<P>
	And a seventh-grade girl in Mesquite, an eastern Dallas suburb,  
was suspended after she allegedly showed classmates a list of 35 
students she wished were dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, what happened in Colorado has caused every district  
to re-examine the way they handle possible threats and security 
issues,'' said Ian Halperin of the Mesquite Independent School 
District. ``Things that previously were taken lightly or ignored 
will now be re-examined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Pennsylvania, a Berks County high school was to remain closed  
today after authorities found and detonated a package that appeared 
to be a pipe bomb hidden on a campus roof. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured. The package was found after someone who  
sounded like a teen-age boy phoned in a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	A high school in Newton, Pa., was also to be closed today after  
officials heard of ``rumors circulating in the high school that 
contained the threat of potential violence,'' said principal David 
Yates. A security sweep was planned as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ohio, four teen-age boys were taken into custody for  
allegedly making threats, including a 13-year-old who said 
Wednesday he was going ``to come into the school with a gun and 
kill all of the people that he didn't like,'' said Police Chief 
Scott Ballentine in Tuscarawas, 90 miles east of Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	Evaluating copycat threats is difficult, said psychologist David  
Walsh, director of the National Institute on Media and the Family 
in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a challenge to walk the middle line and not go to the  
extreme so that every kid who wears a black jacket becomes a 
suspect,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  NATO Resolves To Continue Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Western leaders, celebrating NATO's 50th  
anniversary, pledged today to intensify their military fight 
against Yugoslavia and maintain it until their demands are met. 
``We will not allow this campaign of terror to succeed. NATO is 
determined to prevail,'' the alliance's 19 partners declared. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement, issued at the conclusion of a three-hour session  
that dealt exclusively with the crisis in Kosovo, said the bombing, 
now in its fifth week, would end if Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic ends his crackdown in the province and meets other NATO 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, at a ceremony commemorating the April 1949  
signing of the charter setting up the Cold War alliance that 
confronted Soviet power in Europe, described Milosevic's regime as 
``the last European dictatorship of the 20th century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The alliance will not have meaning in the 21st century if it  
permits the slaughter of innocents on its doorsteps,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can be no compromise on these conditions,'' the joint  
statement said. The demands include a withdrawal of Serbian forces 
from Kosovo, an armed international peacekeeping force and a 
settlement that would restore autonomy to ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement also called for an oil embargo against Yugoslavia  
-- although it did not specify how it would be carried out -- and 
said NATO would seek a U.N. Security Council resolution supporting 
demilitarization of Kosovo and an international peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-page statement did not mention the possibility of  
sending ground troops into the battle -- a subject on which alliance 
leaders are divided. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the military offensive  
against Belgrade shows ``values have meaning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solana welcomed into the alliance three former Warsaw Pact  
nations -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Poland's president, Aleksander Kwasniewski, told the gathering:  
``The dreams of our fathers and grandfathers have now come true. 
... The doors to NATO must stay open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Balkans crisis brings with NATO membership ``not only a  
feeling of comfort, it is also about shared responsibility,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders signed a commemorative copy of the 1949 treaty, each  
signing on the document alongside pictures on the treaty of their 
national flags. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit brought 42 heads of government to town -- the 19 NATO  
leaders and leaders of 23 partner states. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking a U.N. Security Council resolution to force a settlement  
on Milosevic likely would set up a confrontation with Russia, which 
has veto power in the Security Council and opposes the bombing. The 
leaders said Russia has ``an important role to play in a search for 
a solution to the conflict in Kosovo'' and said they want to work 
constructively with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO announced it would enforce economic sanctions more  
forcefully -- and called for ``an embargo on petroleum products.'' 
It directed defense ministers to develop a way to keep seaborne oil 
from reaching Yugoslavia. The United States has proposed boarding 
and searching ships in the Adriatic suspected of supplying oil to 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is prepared to suspend its airstrikes once Belgrade has  
unequivocally accepted the ... conditions and demonstrably begun to 
withdraw its forces from Kosovo, according to precise and rapid 
timetable,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana later told a news conference that NATO defense ministers  
would ``look into all the possibilities for implementing the 
sanctions,'' including the embargo, in a way that did not adversely 
affect the already fragile economy of Montenegro, the only Yugoslav 
republic with a port. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Western leaders rejected a new diplomatic  
overture from Milosevic to end the bombing, NATO's first-ever 
military offensive against a sovereign nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The overture did not meet two key demands -- removal of  
Milosevic's forces from the Serbian province and emplacement of an 
armed international peacekeeping force, leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, suggested that Milosevic  
might agree to an armed force in Kosovo under certain 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	But Western leaders still rejected the overture. French  
President Jacques Chirac called it ``totally insufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic must know there is no place for his policies in  
Europe on the eve of the 21st century,'' Solana said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting under extraordinary security, with several blocks  
surrounding the ornate Reagan Building sealed off and helicopters 
hovering overhead, NATO leaders had been expected to debate the 
issue of ground troops at their meeting, although no decision had 
been expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme commander for Europe, told the  
closed-door gathering on Kosovo, ``We are winning. He (Milosevic) 
is losing. And he knows it,'' according to a U.S. official who was 
in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders' statement declares that NATO won't accept any  
threat against neighboring countries and expresses support for the 
government of Montenegro, Yugoslavia's smaller, pro-Western 
republic, saying any attempt to undermine that government would 
have grave consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as NATO leaders met, the air campaign against Yugoslavia  
continued without pause. The headquarters of Belgrade's main 
television network was hit, and NATO destroyed one of Milosevic's 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that damage continues,'' British Prime  
Minister Tony Blair said Friday morning on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton earlier bestowed his support on Solana's decision to  
have NATO military leaders update contingency plans for Yugoslavia, 
including one for a possible ground assault. The president called 
it ``a wise and prudent course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all NATO leaders were comfortable with the progress of the  
air war. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis earlier said prolonged  
bombing of Yugoslavia could turn his nation against NATO and the 
United States.''The more the war continues, the more difficult the 
problems will be,'' Simitis. But at the ceremony, Smitis stayed 
away from the subject, saying NATO should aim to work for ``secure 
cooperation, peace and prosperity.''

	Serb TV Blasted Off Air by NATO  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO struck the headquarters of  
Serbia's state television Friday, knocking the country's main 
station off the air and killing at least one person. The attack 
came hours after a Russian envoy said Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic had accepted the idea of a U.N.-controlled 
``international presence'' in Kosovo. It was unclear if that meant 
the armed force demanded by NATO, and it appeared to be the same 
offer Milosevic made to a Belarus delegation last week.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a month of NATO bombing, Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic is having difficulty moving his 
troops, supplying them or maintaining their loyalty, the Pentagon 
says. The air campaign has heavily damaged roads, bridges and 
resupply depots, as well as important communications systems and 
significant percentages of Serb weaponry, Pentagon officials said 
Thursday in one of their most-detailed briefings yet of the damage 
done by the NATO airstrikes.

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The two gunmen in the Columbine High  
massacre were planning to blow up their school and probably had 
help from others, investigators said Thursday after discovering a 
powerful bomb in the kitchen. The discovery of the 20-pound propane 
tank heightened suspicions that the two killers had help from other 
people. Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, killed 12 students

than the 500,000 acres burned up last year, Gov. Jeb Bush has asked 
President Clinton to declare an emergency in 67 counties. Bush 
requested that federal funds be made available to the counties 
because the fires that have burned more than 240,000 acres this 
year will likely continue until the state gets much-needed rain. 
``As of this date last year, only 9,000 acres in Florida had 
burned,'' Bush wrote in the request Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Nevada KOs Call for Open Scoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Acknowledging he and other promoters have let  
the sport erode, Bob Arum tried unsuccessfully Friday to get Nevada 
boxing officials to allow open scoring on a trial basis. 
</P>
<P>
	During a contentious hour-long appearance before the Nevada  
Athletic Commission, Arum contended open scoring was needed to 
restore public confidence in a sport he said has been declining the 
last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``On our watch we've let this sport of boxing decline,'' Arum  
said. ``We let it decline because we were too greedy, we wanted 
instant gratification and we didn't look for the long-term 
viability of the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arum's comments came as he tried to get the commission to try  
open scoring in a May 8 Las Vegas card topped by a WBC super 
batamweight title defense by Erik Morales against Juan Carlos 
Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	He failed in that effort, but not before a series of heated  
exchanges between Arum and commission members. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what you are doing is a disservice to boxing and is in  
some ways inexcusable,'' Arum told the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be open scoring Saturday night on a fight card in  
Washington, but Nevada commissioners said there were far more 
questions posed than answered by telling fans what the judge's 
scores are after each round. 
</P>
<P>
	``By saying no to you today, hopefully we will show other states  
they, too, can say no,'' commission vice chairman James Nave said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum's attempt to get judge's scores posted after the rounds for  
the May 8 card came in the wake of the scoring controversy in the 
Lennox Lewis-Evander Holyfield heavyweight title fight in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	But much of his presentation to the commission centered on Oscar  
De La Hoya's narrow decision over Pernell Whitaker and comments by 
HBO broadcasters during that fight. Arum played tape of the fight, 
and criticized commentator Harold Lederman for not watching closely 
enough to offer scoring opinions. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum contended Lederman was too concerned with comments by  
fellow broadcaster Larry Merchant when De La Hoya switched styles 
in the sixth round. He told viewers he thought Whitaker won the 
round when all three judges favored De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point I'm trying to make is not whether Harold Lederman is  
good or bad,'' Arum said. ``In fact, he wasn't watching it. He was 
listening to Merchant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arum said commentators on HBO and Showtime, which show big  
fights on pay-per-view, often mislead viewers into thinking fights 
aren't being judged correctly. He claimed that could be corrected 
if the actual scoring was shown after each round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right then, when it happened, Lederman's error would have been  
exposed,'' Arum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners, though, expressed concern about how boxers would  
react in late rounds if they knew they were trailing badly or 
winning by a lot of points. They said open scoring was a knee-jerk 
reaction to the Holyfield-Lewis fight, and that if the fight had 
been in Las Vegas the judges would have been experienced Nevada 
judges and the fight would have been scored correctly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe boxing has many problems, but I don't believe open  
scoring is going to solve them,'' Nave said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission ended up not even voting on the proposal and  
simply letting it die. But not before Arum, waving and shouting in 
anger, was told to quiet down. 
</P>
<P>
	``You sound like a House manager,'' Arum told Nave.

<P>
	NATO announced it would enforce economic sanctions more  
forcefully -- and called for ``an embargo on petroleum products.'' 
It directed defense ministers to develop a way to keep seaborne oil 
from reaching Yugoslavia. The United States has proposed boarding 
and searching ships in the Adriatic suspected of supplying oil to 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is prepared to suspend its airstrikes once Belgrade has  
unequivocally accepted the ... conditions and demonstrably begun to 
withdraw its forces from Kosovo, according to precise and rapid 
timetable,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana later told a news conference that NATO defense ministers  
would ``look into all the possibilities for implementing the 
sanctions,'' including the embargo, in a way that did not adversely 
affect the already fragile economy of Montenegro, the only Yugoslav 
republic with a port. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Western leaders rejected a new diplomatic  
overture from Milosevic to end the bombing, NATO's first-ever 
military offensive against a sovereign nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The overture did not meet two key demands -- removal of  
Milosevic's forces from the Serbian province and emplacement of an 
armed international peacekeeping force, leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, suggested that Milosevic  
might agree to an armed force in Kosovo under certain 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	But Western leaders still rejected the overture. French  
President Jacques Chirac called it ``totally insufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic must know there is no place for his policies in  
Europe on the eve of the 21st century,'' Solana said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting under extraordinary security, with several blocks  
surrounding the ornate Reagan Building sealed off and helicopters 
hovering overhead, NATO leaders had been expected to debate the 
issue of ground troops at their meeting, although no decision had 
been expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme commander for Europe, told the  
closed-door gathering on Kosovo, ``We are winning. He (Milosevic) 
is losing. And he knows it,'' according to a U.S. official who was 
in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders' statement declares that NATO won't accept any  
threat against neighboring countries and expresses support for the 
government of Montenegro, Yugoslavia's smaller, pro-Western 
republic, saying any attempt to undermine that government would 
have grave consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as NATO leaders met, the air campaign against Yugoslavia  
continued without pause. The headquarters of Belgrade's main 
television network was hit, and NATO destroyed one of Milosevic's 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that damage continues,'' British Prime  
Minister Tony Blair said Friday morning on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton earlier bestowed his support on Solana's decision to  
have NATO military leaders update contingency plans for Yugoslavia, 
including one for a possible ground assault. The president called 
it ``a wise and prudent course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all NATO leaders were comfortable with the progress of the  
air war. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis earlier said prolonged  
bombing of Yugoslavia could turn his nation against NATO and the 
United States.''The more the war continues, the more difficult the 
problems will be,'' Simitis. But at the ceremony, Smitis stayed 
away from the subject, saying NATO should aim to work for ``secure 
cooperation, peace and prosperity.''

<HEADLINE>  Nomo is No More With Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Hideo Nomo experiment is no more. At least  
not in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Cubs released the former NL Rookie of the Year on  
Friday after he declined to stay in the minors for two more starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement with the Cubs, Nomo was to make three starts  
for Triple-A Iowa and then Chicago would either promote him to the 
majors with an $800,000 base salary plus incentives that could 
total another $2 million, ask him to stay longer in the minors or 
release him. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs general manager Ed Lynch watched Nomo's shaky outing  
Thursday in Des Moines and after consulting with other team 
officials determined the right-hander was not ready to help the 
major league team. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch asked Nomo's agent, Don Nomura, if his client would agree  
to two more starts at Iowa. Nomura said no and so the Cubs released 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nomo's third start with Iowa, he walked six, struck out four  
and gave up three hits and two runs in six innings during a 3-1 
loss to Memphis. He threw 51 strikes and 47 balls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked at the quality of his pitches and command,'' Lynch,  
a former major league pitcher, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have someone who has either very good command or  
overpowering stuff, one of the two, you could justify bringing him 
to your major league club. We just didn't see the command or stuff 
that we felt was good enough to get major league hitters out. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's our opinion. I'm sure he has a different opinion of his  
command and his stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo and Nomura were not available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Nomo was waived by the New York Mets this spring and the Cubs,  
hungry for pitching with Kerry Wood out for the season following 
elbow surgery, signed Nomo to a Triple-A deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs also have three other pitchers currently on the  
disabled list -- starters Kevin Tapani and Jeremi Gonzalez and 
reliever Terry Adams. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch said he was disappointed that it didn't work out. He said  
Nomo may have a chance of regaining his form by summer but insisted 
he wasn't ready at this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been a nice boost to add a pitcher of his name  
to our staff,'' Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it was fair to our club right now to bring him  
to the major leagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo's previous two outings at Iowa were more encouraging than  
his third. He allowed five earned runs in 11 innings. In his second 
appearance against Las Vegas, he pitched six shutout innings and 
struck out 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo's major league record is 49-41 with a 3.66 ERA in four  
seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Mets, but he faltered last 
season. He went 2-7 before the Dodgers dealt him to the Mets in 
June in a four-player deal. 
</P>
<P>
	He was ineffective this spring, going 0-2 with a 7.62 ERA in  
four appearances, before the Mets gave up on him. They sent him to 
Triple-A Norfolk outright March 24 and put him on unconditional 
release waivers two days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo was the NL's Rookie of the Year in 1995 when he struck out  
236 and allowed hitters just a .182 average.

<HEADLINE> NATO Knocks Serb TV Off Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO struck the headquarters of  
Serbia's state television with deadly precision today, knocking the 
country's main source of news off the air a day after hitting the 
home of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	A Russian mediator pushing to settle the Kosovo conflict,  
meanwhile, claimed Yugoslavia was willing to accept an 
international military force. But officials in Belgrade said 
Milosevic only backs an unarmed force in Kosovo -- contrary to a key 
element of a Western-backed peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO immediately rejected the plan, repeating demands that  
Milosevic end the violent campaign in Kosovo, remove his troops and 
accept an international peacekeeping force before its month-long 
allied campaign ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten people were killed in the airstrike on Radio Television  
Serbia, said federal minister Goran Matic, 20 were believed still 
buried in the debris and 19 others were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has long said Serbian television was a legitimate target  
because it was spreading ``propaganda'' about the month-long allied 
air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	RTS had been broadcasting a taped interview with Milosevic by  
Houston's KHOU-TV when its downtown Belgrade headquarters was hit 
by a missile. RTS resumed broadcasting a few hours later by showing 
footage of allied damage to the building. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack on the day NATO opened its 50th anniversary summit  
came after a Russian envoy said Milosevic accepted the idea of an 
``international presence'' in Kosovo, where 14 months of war has 
left thousands of ethnic Albanians dead and 650,000 refugees since 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, after meeting  
nine hours in Belgrade with Milosevic on Thursday, claimed that 
Milosevic would agree to accept armed forces from other countries 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The military will be there,'' he said in response to a  
question in Moscow. ``Of course we mean the military. ... There is 
a war going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But his remarks came just hours after Yugoslav Deputy Foreign  
Minister Nebojsa Vujovic said Milosevic only backs allowing ``a 
U.N. unarmed presence ... a U.N. observer presence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	French President Jacques Chirac welcomed Russia's efforts but  
called the proposal ``totally insufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO spokesman Jamie Shea dismissed Milosevic's overture: ``The  
next time he gets in touch, it has to be a much more substantial 
offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that he's prepared to allow foreign troops in,''  
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon added, ``does not say nearly 
enough. He has to be prepared to take his troops out and stop the 
killing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav leader ``must know there is no place for his  
policies in Europe on the eve of the 21st century,'' NATO 
Secretary-General Javier Solana said in opening the three-day 
Washington summit. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO said alliance airstrikes were not aimed at the media: ``We  
are targeting communications and radio and TV nodes which are 
supporting the power structure and the propaganda machine of Mr. 
Milosevic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said NATO was trying hard to hold casualties down but ``we  
never promised'' airstrikes couldn't cause deaths in ``dual-use 
facilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Milosevic came to power in 1989, Serbian TV has been one  
of the pillars of his rule, expressing only official views and 
denouncing the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The state-run news agency Tanjug said about 150 people were  
inside the building at the time of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack knocked down the network's transmission tower and  
collapsed its top two floors, according to reporters on the scene. 
Thick smoke filled the street, and terrified staff milled about 
calling the names of colleagues they feared were trapped inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were sitting in the editing room and all of a sudden we  
heard a tremendous blast,'' videotape editor Sava Andjelkovic told 
reporters. ``A wall behind me virtually vanished, and then the 
entire wing of the building. We heard screams of wounded people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters saw the body of one dead man -- almost decapitated --  
dangling from the rubble. Another man was trapped between two huge 
concrete blocks. Doctors amputated both his legs at the site. He 
was rushed to the hospital, where he died, media reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	Details on the others reported killed weren't available but  
officials said the missile also destroyed the satellite link with 
Eurovision, used by foreign TV crews to transmit material abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian Information Minister Aleksandar Vucic blamed the leaders  
of Britain and the United States for the devastation, saying ``just 
punishment will reach them. They are the biggest criminals and 
beasts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin said talks with NATO concerning Moscow's plan would  
continue today by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, a spokesman for the British prime minister said  
President Clinton and Tony Blair discussed the offer in a 20-minute 
phone call but ``they both felt that what Milosevic was offering at 
this stage fell well short of what was required to meet NATO's 
conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after Chernomyrdin left for Moscow, alliance jets were back  
in action Thursday night and early today, attacking a railway 
bridge on the Ibar River in central Serbia, three Serbian 
television relays, a major rail bridge west of Belgrade and the 
southern city of Nis. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav media also reported NATO jets pummeled the area around  
the southern town of Vranje and blasted Uzice, 75 miles southeast 
of here. NATO jets reportedly destroyed a bridge over the Rasina 
River near Krusevac. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all of NATO's 19 leaders favor continuing the air war.  
</P>
<P>
	Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said prolonged bombing of  
Yugoslavia could turn his nation against NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees, meanwhile, continued to stream out of Kosovo into  
neighboring countries like Albania, where hundreds of thousands of 
ethnic Albanians remained displaced, and NATO jets rained dozens of 
missiles near Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Rear Adm. Thomas Wilson said Milosevic's army has now been made  
more vulnerable to a NATO ground campaign, should the alliance 
undertake that step.

<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Jay Alves stood behind home plate in the  
stadium that shook violently during the devastating 1989 
earthquake, his thoughts focused on a much more recent tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Alves, public relations director for the Colorado Rockies, lives  
in Littleton, Colo., where two students killed 12 classmates, a 
teacher and themselves at Columbine High School on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, he was with the Rockies in San Francisco as they  
played for the first time since the school shootings. The Rockies, 
who postponed home games Tuesday and Wednesday, played with ``CHS'' 
patches on their right sleeves in memory of the shooting victims. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade ago, Alves was at Candlestick Park as the public  
relations director of the Oakland Athletics as a violent earthquake 
shook northern California and interrupted the 1989 World Series 
against the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a similar feeling to the 1989 earthquake,'' Alves said.  
``It reminds me very much of that time, when people lost their 
lives and baseball didn't feel important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rockies players said they were trying to refocus their thoughts  
on baseball, not on the TV images of their grief-stricken 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been really tough. As a father, I can't imagine what  
those parents are going through. Especially when it's happening in 
your own backyard,'' said relief pitcher Chuck McElroy. ``You still 
have to do your job. But it will always be in our minds, because 
it's like we were there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The postponed games against the Montreal Expos will be made up  
in August. Teams in other sports also postponed games -- the Stanley 
Cup series between the Colorado Avalanche and San Jose Sharks 
scheduled to open with games Wednesday and Thursday nights in 
Denver now will begin Saturday in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer postponed their  
Saturday night home game against the Chicago Fire. No makeup game 
was immediately announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies are starting a two-week road trip, their longest of  
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball is very, very secondary to what's going on in our  
community,'' said Rockies second baseman Mike Lansing, who lives 
about 10 minutes from the school. ``Maybe it's better that we get 
away and let the community do what they need to do and not worry 
about baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado general manager Bob Gebhard said the Rockies will do  
anything they can to help the community, and that the team expects 
to do something this summer to honor the victims and rescue 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our players have been very emotional about it, as we all have  
been,'' Gephard said. ``I think it was good we were able to go on 
the road and play baseball -- not that we're going to forget.''

<HEADLINE> Schools Act Against Copycat Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Dozens of students around the country have been suspended and  
arrested since the Columbine High massacre for making what were 
regarded as threats to carry out copycat attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools have been evacuated, locked down and closed as a result  
of the incidents, which have taken place in big cities and small 
towns alike since the attack in Littleton, Colo., on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no tolerance whatsoever for threats,'' said Police  
Chief Thomas Bauer of Oak Creek, Wis., where two 16-year-old boys 
were arrested for allegedly threatening a study hall supervisor. 
One youth mentioned the Colorado shootings; the other one held his 
hand in the shape of a gun and yelled, ``Pow!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you say it, it's our intention that you apparently meant it  
and you will be seeing the district attorney,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	An 18-year-old student in Greenville, S.C., was put under house  
arrest and forbidden to go near his school Thursday after allegedly 
telling a teacher that he would ``pull a Colorado on all of you.'' 
Police said he called the shootings ``the funniest thing he'd ever 
heard of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three teen-agers in Cherry Hill, N.J., were suspended after  
witnesses said they wore black trench coats and pantomimed shooting 
guns and throwing bombs in a school hallway. 
</P>
<P>
	Trench coats like the ones worn by the two gunmen were banned in  
Denver and two other Colorado districts since the attack for fear 
they could be used to hide weapons. They were also banned at a high 
school in Fredericton, in Canada, because they made some students 
uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett Leventhal, a child psychologist at the University of  
Chicago, suggested that some schools are overreacting. He said that 
statistically, schools are extremely safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Students who threaten violence should be taken seriously,  
Leventhal said. But he added: ``Most schools are far better 
equipped with social workers, teachers, counselors, than the 
police. They don't need the police just because there was a 
shooting in Colorado this week.''

<HEADLINE> Mother, 2 Children Killed by Truck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMLIN, W.Va. (AP) -- A truck carrying tons of asphalt overturned  
onto a car today, crushing the vehicle and killing a mother and her 
two children. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident so severely smashed the woman's Lincoln Town Car  
that authorities initially thought she had been driving a 
subcompact. The total weight of the asphalt was not immediately 
known. 
</P>
<P>
	Leigh Ann Poindexter, 38, of Logan, her 8-year-old daughter  
11-year-old son were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck driver, Billy D. Kirk, 33, of Wayne, was charged with  
three counts of negligent homicide. Kirk, who was not seriously 
injured, was released on $5,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	``The front tires of the truck were like glass. I've never seen  
tires so bad in my career,'' said State Police Sgt. Joe Parsons.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Disrupt Airline Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Northwest Airlines Corp. ended its annual meeting early Friday  
after protesters frustrated with drawn-out negotiations between the 
company and its flight attendants began yelling and making 
speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks have been ongoing for 2 1/2 years and are in mediation.  
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Gary Wilson ended the meeting, which was held in New  
York, and said he would individually answer the stack of written 
questions that had been submitted by employees and shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Austin, a spokesman for the Eagan, Minn.-based airline, said  
the man and woman who began the disruption did not appear to be 
flight attendants, but two or three other people who joined in were 
wearing Northwest uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 50 and 75 uniformed flight attendants attended the  
meeting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of Teamsters Local 2000 did not immediately return  
telephone calls seeking comment. Most union officials had attended 
the meeting, a receptionist at the union's Minneapolis headquarters 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Billie Davenport, president of Local 2000 who was at the annual  
meeting, said earlier that progress was being made in the 
negotiations but salary, retirement, job protection and scheduling 
issues remained unsettled. 
</P>
<P>
	``These issues are the guts and soul of what we do,'' Davenport  
said in a recorded message on the union's member hot line. 
</P>
<P>
	Another negotiating session is scheduled to begin Wednesday in  
Washington, with National Mediation Board member Maggie Jacobsen 
attending. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no disruptions during the formal business meeting,  
Austin said, and the election of Northwest's board of directors 
proceeded without incident.

<HEADLINE> Allied Air Campaign Widened Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sea-launched cruise missiles struck two  
electric power transformers in the Belgrade area overnight, marking 
a further escalation of NATO's air campaign, the Pentagon said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a new class of targets,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth  
Bacon said at a briefing at which he announced that allied 
warplanes flew 434 missions Thursday despite bad weather. The 
electric power transformers were struck by Tomahawk cruise 
missiles, which use satellites for precise guidance. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said the electrical power sites also served residential  
and business customers but were struck because they supply power to 
military command and control facilities linked to the Yugoslav 
army. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon also announced that the Pentagon has decided not to add a  
second aircraft carrier to the NATO naval force attacking 
Yugoslavia. The USS Enterprise, sailing in the Mediterranean Sea, 
will return to its home port at Norfolk, Va., in early May as 
scheduled rather than join the fight over Kosovo, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Enterprise, with 75 aircraft and 5,500 sailors aboard, had  
been operating in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's coming home,'' Bacon said.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials had been considering diverting the Enterprise to the  
Adriatic Sea as part of a strengthening of U.S. and allied air 
power for Operation Allied Force. But the Navy prevailed in its 
argument that the carrier and its battle group of surface ships and 
submarines should return on time. 
</P>
<P>
	The USS Theodore Roosevelt battle group is operating in the NATO  
campaign, along with British and French carriers. Strike aircraft 
from the Roosevelt attacked a column of seven Yugoslav armored 
personnel carriers overnight and apparently inflicted heavy damage, 
defense officials said, speaking anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
	After a month of NATO bombing, Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic is having difficulty moving his troops, supplying them or 
maintaining their loyalty, the Pentagon says. 
</P>
<P>
	The air campaign has heavily damaged roads, bridges and resupply  
depots, as well as important communications systems and significant 
percentages of Serb weaponry, Pentagon officials said Thursday in 
one of their most-detailed briefings yet of the damage done by the 
NATO airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The more than 9,000 air missions over Yugoslavia and its  
rebellious province of Kosovo have left Milosevic's army more 
vulnerable to a NATO ground campaign, should the alliance undertake 
that step, said Rear Adm. Thomas Wilson, director of intelligence 
for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebel ethnic Albanian guerrillas on the ground inside Kosovo  
also are rebounding as NATO pounds Yugoslav troops, equipment, 
supplies and command-and-control facilities from the air, Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So that fact, combined with the destruction of the  
infrastructure, the reduction of the force structure, would make it 
more difficult in my view for a defense of the country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials have said Yugoslav troops already are digging  
into defensive positions and mining key land routes into Kosovo, 
maneuvers that would complicate any NATO ground offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton called NATO's plans to update its ground  
invasion scenario ``a wise and prudent course,'' but stressed that 
NATO intended to stick with the air campaign and had no intention 
of launching a ground offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``A vigorous prosecution of the air campaign, an intensification  
of economic pressures, along with our continuing diplomatic efforts 
I believe is the correct strategy, and I believe it will succeed,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its attack on the Yugoslav command structure, NATO  
missiles hit one of Milosevic's residences in Belgrade on Thursday. 
U.S. officials from Clinton on down denied that NATO was trying to 
kill the Yugoslav leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. military offered the unusually specific picture of  
allied operations and the sunniest outlook so far as NATO leaders 
gathered in Washington for a commemoration of the alliance's 50 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now there is increasing evidence, both among forces in Kosovo  
and among the Serbian army in general, that this campaign is having 
an impact on their morale,'' Wilson said.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Star Pippen Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Scottie Pippen denies being drunk when police  
pulled him over for running a red light. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not intoxicated when arrested after the game last night  
and I'm confident the evidence will support me in the end,'' Pippen 
said in a statement issued by his agent after his arrest early 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer who stopped Pippen around 1:30 a.m. said the NBA  
star ran a red light. A member of the department's DWI task force 
was called after suspecting Pippen was intoxicated, police 
spokesman Fred King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, 33, did poorly on the field sobriety test and was taken  
into custody, where he was videotaped and given the opportunity to 
take a Breathalyzer test, King said. 
</P>
<P>
	After he refused the Breathalyzer, Pippen was booked on  
suspicion of DWI and released on $500 bond just before 7 a.m. His 
arraignment is set for next Thursday before Harris County 
Court-at-Law Judge Sherman Ross. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen has not formally hired a lawyer, but Houston lawyer Rusty  
Hardin said he is set to meet with Pippen next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates supported Pippen during a brief practice Thursday  
before flying to Los Angeles for a game with the Clippers tonight. 
Pippen didn't attend the workout, but coach Rudy Tomjanovich said 
he would accompany the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping it won't be a distraction,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We  
are trying not to make any assumptions. It would be unfair to 
comment when nothing has been established. I'm sort of used to 
unexpected things happening. You just try not to lose your 
composure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston, currently fourth in the Western Conference playoff  
race, was upset by the Dallas Mavericks 109-95 Wednesday night, 
keeping the Rockets from clinching a spot in the playoffs and 
snapping Dallas' 11-game losing streak against the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen had four points and three rebounds and was repeatedly  
beaten defensively. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scottie is my teammate and I'm behind him 100 percent,''  
Charles Barkley said. ``This is not Armageddon. It happened. 
Scottie Pippen probably wasn't the only person stopped last night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scottie Pippen is a role model. If all the kids grew up to be  
like Scottie, the world would be a better place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen has struggled to fit into the Rockets' alignment after  
earning seven NBA All-Star appearances and helping the Chicago 
Bulls win six NBA championships. He broke out with a season-high 31 
points on April 15 against Portland and had 22 points and 11 
rebounds in a victory over Seattle on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Pippen was traded from the Bulls, with whom he had  
spent his 11-year pro career, and signed a five-year, $67.2 million 
contract with the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, slowed by back and hand injuries, still hasn't missed a  
game. He is averaging 14 points and six rebounds, both below his 
career norms, and his six assists per game is slightly better.

<HEADLINE> NATO Debates Yugoslavia Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As they celebrated NATO's 50th anniversary,  
Western leaders today rejected a diplomatic overture from 
Yugoslavia's leader and pledged to press on with the alliance's 
first military action. ``I think that our conditions are clear,'' 
President Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO leaders have insisted Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic  
call off his crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and accept a 
settlement that would include an armed international peacekeeping 
force in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's brief remarks to reporters came at the White House as  
he left for the opening session of the alliance's three-day summit, 
which brought together presidents and prime ministers of the 19 
NATO countries and 23 partner states. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair rejected  
Milosevic's offer to accept some form of international force in the 
Serbian province of Kosovo because it fell short of NATO's demand 
for a military presence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that damage continues,'' Blair said. The  
British leader, however, sounded some guarded optimism. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not enough because it doesn't meet the demands that NATO  
has set out,'' Blair said. ``But if it is an indication that 
Milosevic now realizes that we will carry on until those demands 
are met, then to that extent it is something we should note.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also rejected Milosevic's offer as falling ``well short  
of the conditions to end the bombing,'' White House spokesman David 
Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president reacted cautiously to the offer Thursday. ``If  
there is an offer for a genuine security force, that's the first 
time Mr. Milosevic has ever done that, and that represents, I 
suppose, some step forward,'' Clinton said at a joint Rose Garden 
appearance with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit-eve overture was relayed from Belgrade by former  
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who said Milosevic 
would accept the idea of a U.N.-controlled ``international 
presence'' in Kosovo if the bombing stops and NATO withdraws troops 
from Yugoslavia's borders. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the leaders gathered here under extraordinary security  
precautions, the air campaign against Yugoslavia, now in its fifth 
week, continued. The headquarters of Belgrade's main television 
network was hit, and NATO destroyed one of Milosevic's homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the alliance was now targeting Milosevic, Clinton said,  
``No, but we are targeting his command and control facilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO leaders planned a morning session on Kosovo with the issue  
of ground troops -- initially ruled out -- now sitting unsteadily on 
the table. 
</P>
<P>
	The subject is ``not formally on the agenda'' but could be  
discussed by individual members, said a NATO official briefing 
reporters on condition of anonymity. ``Do not expect any decision 
on ground troops at this summit,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials also were pushing for a blockade or embargo on  
oil going into Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO official said the alliance would issue a formal  
declaration today reiterating its demands to Milosevic, and express 
NATO's confidence in the air campaign as the primary instrument for 
degrading Yugoslav forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton bestowed his support on Solana's decision to have NATO  
military leaders update contingency plans, including one for a 
possible ground assault. The president called it ``a wise and 
prudent course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Clinton and other western leaders continued to stress  
they believed the conflict could be ended with an intensifying air 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bombing is working, but we need to intensify it and carry  
it on,'' Blair said on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all NATO leaders were comfortable with the progress of the  
air war. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said prolonged bombing of  
Yugoslavia could turn his nation against NATO and the United 
States. While sticking to Greece's official support, Simitis said: 
``The more the war continues, the more difficult the problems will 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders planned an early afternoon gathering to celebrate  
the April 4, 1949, signing of the treaty that established the Cold 
War alliance to confront the Soviet Union in Europe. It was to be 
followed by a reception at the Capitol and a White House dinner. 
The summit concludes Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Security was extremely tight.  
</P>
<P>
	To minimize traffic gridlock for the largest international  
summit in the city's history, thousands of federal employes were 
given the day off. Schools were closed, as well as many businesses 
in a 100-square-block downtown security zone. Even some of the 
Smithsonian museums on the National Mall were closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The event had been planned as a jubilant 50th anniversary  
celebration -- and to welcome three newest members, former Warsaw 
Pact nations Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	But the festivities were muted by concern over the conflict in  
Kosovo, where Serb-led Yugoslav forces have forced hundreds of 
thousands of ethnic Albanians to flee.

<HEADLINE> Wynette Widower Wants Suit Ended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The widower of Tammy Wynette is asking  
that a lawsuit blaming him for her death be thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
	George Richey claims the lawsuit by three of Ms. Wynette's  
daughters accuses him of medical malpractice even though he is not 
a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Stand By Your Man'' singer was 55 when she died last April  
at her home. Her physician, Dr. Wallis Marsh of Pittsburgh, flew in 
to sign the death certificate and listed the cause of death as a 
blood clot in the lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Wynette's daughters sued Richey and March earlier month,  
claiming Ms. Wynette could have lived longer with better medical 
care, including closer supervision. Also, they claim that narcotics 
prescribed by Marsh and sometimes administered by Richey could have 
played a part in her death. 
</P>
<P>
	Richey and Marsh have denied any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Radio Merger OK After Divestiture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has approved Clear  
Channel Communications' $3.8 billion acquisition of Jacor 
Communications after the companies agreed to sell 18 radio stations 
in four cities to preserve competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's antitrust division contended the original deal  
would have significantly reduced competition for radio advertising 
in Cleveland and Dayton, Ohio; Louisville, Ky.; and Tampa, Fla. 
With the divestiture, the number of competitors in those cities 
will either remain the same or increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Clear Channel, based in San Antonio, Texas, is the third largest  
radio group in the country based on number of stations, and Jacor 
is second. As of March 1998, Clear Channel operated more than 200 
stations in 48 cities. Jacor, based in Covington, Ky., operates 230 
stations in 59 metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The stations to be sold and the buyers are:  
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland: WENZ-FM and WERE-AM to Radio One, Inc., WNCX-FM to  
CBS Radio Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayton: WING-AM, WING-FM and WGTZ-FM to Blue Chip Broadcasting  
Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisville: WDJX-FM, WFIA-AM, WLRS-FM to Blue Chip Broadcasting  
and WSFR-FM and WVEZ-FM to Cox Radio, Inc. In addition, Clear 
Channel will divest certain rights it has to the operation of 
WMHX-FM to Cox Radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa: WHPT-FM, WFJO-FM (currently operating as WILV-FM) and  
WDUV-FM to Cox Radio; WRBQ-FM and WSJT-FM to CBS Radio; WRBQ-AM to 
ABC Inc.; and WZTM-AM to Mega Communications of St. Petersburg

<HEADLINE> Valderrama Sent to Tampa Bay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Carlos Valderrama's stint with the Miami Fusion  
came to an ignoble end Friday when Major League Soccer, unable to 
broker a trade involving the Colombian World Cup star, reassigned 
him back to Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Valderrama returns to the city where he spent his first two MLS  
seasons before moving south to join the Fusion in their expansion 
season. Coach Tim Hankinson said he would start the mop-haired 
midfielder Sunday when Tampa Bay visits New York-New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am taking this unusual action because I believe it to be in  
the best interest of the league to afford Carlos Valderrama the 
opportunity to entertain our fans by doing what he does best -- play 
soccer,'' MLS commissioner Doug Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's action ends nearly two weeks of uncertainty for  
Valderrama, who was benched by Fusion coach Ivo Wortmann for 
ignoring his instructions and playing his own tactical game plan. 
</P>
<P>
	MLS officials will work with the Fusion to obtain another  
prominent international player. But the move leaves Miami without a 
marquee name in one of its most high-profile cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton and Logan had been working all week to move Valderrama,  
who has stayed away from the club since Wortmann benched him and 
said they could not coexist. 
</P>

	Valderrama, an All-Star in each of his three MLS seasons and the  
league's 1996 Most Valuable Player, scored one goal and two assists 
in four games with Miami this season. But his short, crisp passes 
and lack of defense clashed with Wortmann's demand for a quicker 
pace and ``fighters'' in the midfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had hoped this would work out better. I hope the fans will  
continue to support the team,'' Valderrama said in a radio 
interview Thursday. ``I gave Ivo my best, but unfortunately, he 
didn't think it was good enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Logan had said Tuesday he expected Valderrama to be traded  
``within 24 hours,'' but things hit a snag when the Fusion found 
any trade offers to be lacking.

<HEADLINE>  NATO Resolves To Continue Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Western leaders, celebrating NATO's 50th  
anniversary, pledged today to intensify their military fight 
against Yugoslavia and maintain it until their demands are met. 
``We will not allow this campaign of terror to succeed. NATO is 
determined to prevail,'' the alliance's 19 partners declared. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement, issued at the conclusion of a three-hour session  
that dealt exclusively with the crisis in Kosovo, said the bombing, 
now in its fifth week, would end if Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic ends his crackdown in the province and meets other NATO 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, at a ceremony commemorating the April 1949  
signing of the charter setting up the Cold War alliance that 
confronted Soviet power in Europe, described Milosevic's regime as 
``the last European dictatorship of the 20th century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The alliance will not have meaning in the 21st century if it  
permits the slaughter of innocents on its doorsteps,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can be no compromise on these conditions,'' the joint  
statement said. The demands include a withdrawal of Serbian forces 
from Kosovo, an armed international peacekeeping force and a 
settlement that would restore autonomy to ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Congress welcomed the leaders at a ceremony in the  
Capitol's Rotunda. ``Our alliance remains essential,'' said Senate 
Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. ``Ethnic cleansing 
is an affront to everything our nation and our alliance stands for. 
It must end now.'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., called the 
weekend summit ``a most wonderful celebration of democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement also called for an oil embargo against Yugoslavia  
-- although it did not specify how it would be carried out -- and 
said NATO would seek a U.N. Security Council resolution supporting 
demilitarization of Kosovo and an international peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-page statement did not mention the possibility of  
sending ground troops into the battle -- a subject on which alliance 
leaders are divided. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the military offensive  
against Belgrade shows ``values have meaning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solana welcomed into the alliance three former Warsaw Pact  
nations -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Poland's president, Aleksander Kwasniewski, told the gathering:  
``The dreams of our fathers and grandfathers have now come true. 
... The doors to NATO must stay open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Balkans crisis brings with NATO membership ``not only a  
feeling of comfort, it is also about shared responsibility,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders signed a commemorative copy of the 1949 treaty and  
statement of goals for the 21st century, each signing on the 
document alongside pictures of their national flags. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit brought 42 heads of government to town -- the 19 NATO  
leaders and leaders of 23 partner states. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking a U.N. Security Council resolution to force a settlement  
on Milosevic likely would set up a confrontation with Russia, which 
has veto power in the Security Council and opposes the bombing. The 
leaders said Russia has ``an important role to play in a search for 
a solution to the conflict in Kosovo'' and said they want to work 
constructively with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO announced it would enforce economic sanctions more  
forcefully -- and called for ``an embargo on petroleum products.'' 
It directed defense ministers to develop a way to keep seaborne oil 
from reaching Yugoslavia. The United States has proposed boarding 
and searching ships in the Adriatic suspected of supplying oil to 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is prepared to suspend its airstrikes once Belgrade has  
unequivocally accepted the ... conditions and demonstrably begun to 
withdraw its forces from Kosovo, according to precise and rapid 
timetable,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana later told a news conference that NATO defense ministers  
would ``look into all the possibilities for implementing the 
sanctions,'' including the embargo, in a way that did not adversely 
affect the already fragile economy of Montenegro, the only Yugoslav 
republic with a port. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Western leaders rejected a new diplomatic  
overture from Milosevic to end the bombing, NATO's first-ever 
military offensive against a sovereign nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The overture did not meet two key demands -- removal of  
Milosevic's forces from the Serbian province and emplacement of an 
armed international peacekeeping force, leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, suggested that Milosevic  
might agree to an armed force in Kosovo under certain 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	But Western leaders still rejected the overture. French  
President Jacques Chirac called it ``totally insufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic must know there is no place for his policies in  
Europe on the eve of the 21st century,'' Solana said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting under extraordinary security, with several blocks  
surrounding the ornate Reagan Building sealed off and helicopters 
hovering overhead, NATO leaders had been expected to debate the 
issue of ground troops at their meeting, although no decision had 
been expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme commander for Europe, told the  
closed-door gathering on Kosovo, ``We are winning. He (Milosevic) 
is losing. And he knows it,'' according to a U.S. official who was 
in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders' statement declares that NATO won't accept any  
threat against neighboring countries and expresses support for the 
government of Montenegro, Yugoslavia's smaller, pro-Western 
republic, saying any attempt to undermine that government would 
have grave consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as NATO leaders met, the air campaign against Yugoslavia  
continued without pause. The headquarters of Belgrade's main 
television network was hit, and NATO destroyed one of Milosevic's 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that damage continues,'' British Prime  
Minister Tony Blair said Friday morning on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton earlier bestowed his support on Solana's decision to  
have NATO military leaders update contingency plans for Yugoslavia, 
including one for a possible ground assault. The president called 
it ``a wise and prudent course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all NATO leaders were comfortable with the progress of the  
air war. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis earlier said prolonged  
bombing of Yugoslavia could turn his nation against NATO and the 
United States. ``The more the war continues, the more difficult the 
problems will be,'' Simitis. But at the ceremony, Smitis stayed 
away from the subject, saying NATO should aim to work for ``secure 
cooperation, peace and prosperity.''

<HEADLINE> Palladium Higher, Crude Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Palladium futures plunged for the second straight day on the New  
York Mercantile Exchange Friday amid reports that Russia, which 
produces about three-quarters of the world's supply, would begin 
exporting the metal after a nearly four-month interruption. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets Friday, crude oil was down slightly, while  
soybean and corn futures were higher on bullish weather forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium prices suffered their largest drop in almost three  
months amid reports that Japan was expecting Russian imports. Japan 
is the second-largest importer of the product in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Switzerland announced it imported Russian palladium last  
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has shipped few new supplies of palladium since December  
and dwindling inventories have prompted market jitters. Palladium 
is used in catalysts to provide cleaner-burning cars and in 
electronic devices like cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of palladium has jumped more than 30 percent since the  
halt of Russian exports, sending palladium futures to an 11-month 
high earlier in the week. It's the third straight year of such 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium prices also plunged Thursday amid reports palladium  
users were actively seeking alternatives to the metal. 
</P>
<P>
	June palladium fell $15.65 Friday to $355.50 an ounce.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures fell Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade, while  
soybeans and corn rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans and corn received support from forecasts of continued  
rain next week in growing regions of the central United States, 
which was expected to delay planting. 
</P>
<P>
	This came a day after soybean and grain prices were driven  
sharply lower on forecasts for a pattern of dry weather next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Weather, weather and more weather,'' said Don Roose of  
Iowa-based U.S. Commodities Inc. ``That's essentially what broke us 
yesterday and that's what's giving us the strength today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans also took a dive Thursday amid reports that China will  
impose a tax on soybean meal imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures were higher Friday on the same forecasts for rain,  
which was expected to set back planting. There were conflicting 
forecasts, however, which limited gains, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures followed corn and soybeans higher in early  
trading, but later turned lower. The same moisture that was 
expected to delay planting in corn and soybeans could be beneficial 
to the wheat crop, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans for July delivery jumped 2 3/4 cents to $4.94 1/2 a bushel;  
July corn rose 1/2 cent to $2.25 3/4 a bushel; July wheat fell 1 3/4 cent 
to $2.65 3/4 a bushel; July oats rose 2 cents to $1.22 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle was mixed and feeder cattle lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while lean hogs and pork bellies were higher. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .05 cent to 62.72 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle fell .20 cent to 70.62 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
jumped 2.00 cents to 57.60 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose 
1.87 cent to 57.17 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures were slightly lower Friday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange, a day after surging to 16-month highs. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil got above $18 a barrel Thursday, continuing a  
remarkable recovery from 12-year lows. There is concern producer 
cutbacks and production problems will sharply reduce supply going 
into the peak driving season. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, sweet crude for June delivery fell 24 cents to $17.94 a  
barrel; May heating oil fell .70 cent to 43.42 cents a gallon; May 
unleaded gasoline fell .73 cent to 52.72 cents a gallon; May 
natural gas rose 1.0 cent to $2.226 for each 1,000 cubic feet.

<HEADLINE>  Couch Practices With the Browns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- The ball came out of Tim Couch's hand, a  
perfect spiral, and flew 30 yards on a line down field into the 
hands of ... defensive back Eric Stokes -- an interception! 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, well, what do you want on the first day, even a No. 1 draft  
pick's first day? 
</P>
<P>
	Couch, the top selection in last weekend's draft, and the other  
Cleveland rookies practiced as pros for the first time Friday, 
joining Browns veterans at a weekend minicamp. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch made a few nice plays -- ducking the rush a couple of times  
and hitting receivers out of the backfield -- but at other moments 
he looked like what he is, a rookie struggling to adjust to an NFL 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
	It's little wonder. Couch arrived in Cleveland on Tuesday and  
has been spending about four hours a day trying to learn a big 
chunk of coach Chris Palmer's playbook. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, he's overwhelmed with it. He's like any rookie,''  
Palmer said. ``It all runs together. I take him from first grade to 
graduate school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Palmer still said he was pleased with Couch's overall  
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he threw well,'' Palmer said. ``A couple of times he  
took a five-step drop when he was supposed to take a three-step 
drop, but that's part of the game and learning what we're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch was one of six Cleveland quarterbacks, all standing out in  
their orange, no-contact jerseys, who practiced with the team in a 
fieldhouse at Browns headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns starter Ty Detmer and Couch seemed to be getting a few  
more snaps than the other QBs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it went pretty well, especially for the first day,''  
Couch said. ``I made some mistakes, it was far from perfect, but 
I've got plenty of time to get better.''

<HEADLINE> Founder of Piedmont Airlines Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Tom Davis, the founder of Piedmont  
Airlines, has died after a lengthy illness. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who died Thursday, founded Piedmont Aviation, which  
started out selling single-propeller planes to private pilots in 
the 1940s and became one of the country's biggest airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Piedmont Airlines was merged with US Airways in 1989, when  
Piedmont had about 21,500 employees and annual revenues of $2.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was taken with aviation at an early age. Born March 15,  
1918 -- a little more than 14 years after the first flight at Kill 
Devil Hills -- he was a small boy when his father took him to a cow 
pasture south of town to watch one of the early barnstorming pilots 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time he got to high school in 1934, he was spending his  
allowance on flying lessons. 
</P>
<P>
	He started his career with Camel City Flying Service in 1939 and  
one year later branched out on his own. After its founding in 1940, 
Piedmont Aviation branched out with Piedmont Airlines and had its 
maiden voyage in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	Piedmont's first commercial flight took off on Feb. 20, 1948.  
Davis was on board as the plane taxied onto the runway in 
Wilmington and made several stops before landing in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	As head of Piedmont, Davis was known for walking through the  
mechanic shops and asking employees questions. He often talked to 
passengers on the planes he owned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom Davis was one of those very unique people who comes along  
rarely,'' said John G. Medlin Jr., a longtime friend and chairman 
emeritus of Wachovia Corp. ``He was imbued with a sense of caring, 
and that showed through in his employees and the service. We're 
losing one of the last true gentlemen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he is best known as Piedmont's founder, Davis also  
contributed to many organizations. He was a lifetime trustee at 
Wake Forest University, and many times during the 1950s he flew 
over the campus to watch the progress of construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was preceded in death by his wife of 41 years, Nancy  
Teague Davis. He is survived by five children and 13 grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral will be 11 a.m. Saturday at Wait Chapel at Wake  
Forest University.

<HEADLINE> Morris Returns To LPGA Tour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKBRIDGE, Ga. (AP) -- When unsure of which club to pluck from  
her bag, Marianne Morris felt her brother's presence. When hovering 
nervously over a long putt, she remembered his philosophy on life. 
</P>
<P>
	Go for it. Enjoy yourself.  
</P>
<P>
	Playing for the first time since her brother was gunned down in  
a robbery, Morris shot a 5-under-par 67 Friday and was just two 
shots behind leader Maria Hjorth after the first round of LPGA's 
Chick-fil-A Charity Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie Spalding and Kelly Robbins were tied at 66. But the most  
remarkable performance of the day belonged to Morris, clearly 
inspired by the memory of her brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Morris, his sister's mentor, business partner and best  
friend, was shot to death Feb. 21 in an apparent robbery at their 
suburban Atlanta golf shop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I feel like I'm playing for both of us,'' said Marianne  
Morris, one of four players two shots off the lead. ``Maybe I'll be 
more like him: play aggressive and enjoy being out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, 34, considered quitting the tour after her brother's  
death, unsure if the game still had meaning. But two weeks ago, she 
picked up a sand wedge and started chipping. 
</P>
<P>
	She decided to resume her career at Eagles Landing Country Club  
south of Atlanta, where her brother took time away from their 
business a year ago to serve as her caddy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't even think I'd break 80,'' said Morris, a native of  
Middletown, Ohio. ``I haven't touched a club in so long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her round was highlighted by a couple of 25-foot birdie putts  
and another from 20 feet on greens quickened by unseasonably warm, 
dry weather. Each time, she wondered if her brother was guiding the 
ball into the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not known for draining a lot of long putts,'' Morris said.  
``I honestly think there was something going on. Every day that 
goes by now, he'll be watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hjorth bogeyed her final hole, missing a 3-foot putt. That was  
the only slip for the 25-year-old Swede, who had the best round of 
her two-year career and finds herself leading an LPGA tournament 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will go out tomorrow and try to forget today,'' she said.  
``I'll be focused and not look too far into the future. That's been 
a problem for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spalding, who missed the cut four times in her first nine  
tournaments and hasn't finished higher than 31st this year, also 
put together a career-low round despite a triple-bogey at No. 9. 
She compensated with 10 birdies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love fast greens,'' Spalding said. ``All you have to do is  
pick your line and hit it there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris' brother, five years her senior, encouraged her to play  
more aggressively. Last Christmas, he sent his sister a card that 
said, ``1999 is going to be your year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friday was certainly her day. Despite going through the most  
traumatic experience of her life, Morris felt a sense of calm each 
time she stood over a difficult putt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I was going to make them,'' Morris said. ``I felt  
as good on the golf course as I ever have. I don't think I'll be as 
hard as myself as I used to. I'm fortunate to play golf for a 
living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Crafter, who was part of the group at 67 that also included  
Rachel Hetherington and Lorie Kane, said Morris' game will benefit 
from a new perspective on life. 
</P>
<P>
	``The grieving process takes time, but it makes coming back and  
playing so much easier,'' said Crafter, recalling the deaths of her 
parents. ``You can take the pressure of a 3-foot putt. It doesn't 
matter if you miss it. There are more important things in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone seemed to be cheering for Morris -- even those who are  
trying to beat her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a good player,'' Hetherington said, ``and she deserves  
to play well with what she's been through.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Divots:* Nancy Lopez, who won the Chick-fil-A in 1997, becomes the  
official host next year. The tournament name will change to the 
``Chick-fil-A Charity Championship Hosted by Nancy Lopez.'' The 
honor didn't help her Friday as she shot 73. ... Defending champion 
Liselotte Neumann was nine shots off the lead after a 74. ... 
Karrie Webb, a winner three times and a top-10 finisher in all 
seven of her tournaments this year, was five shots off the lead.

<HEADLINE> Rodriguez Didn't Suffer Concussion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Texas Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez escaped  
a home plate collision with nothing more than a bruised cheekbone. 
</P>
<P>
	``No concussion. It's nothing serious,'' said Rangers spokesman  
Brad Horn. ``He is listed day to day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Lawton of the Minnesota Twins, trying to score, slammed  
into Rodriguez in Thursday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawton lowered his right shoulder and plowed into Rodriguez.  
Lawton's shoulder slammed into the left side of Rodriguez's face, 
and the Rangers catcher hit the other side of his head on umpire 
Durwood Merrill's leg as he fell to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez held onto the ball, and Lawton was out to end the  
inning. Rodriguez lay virtually motionless in the dirt for several 
minutes before walking slowly to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers won 6-4.

<HEADLINE> Airport's Control Frequency Hacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration is  
investigating reports someone broke into the local air traffic 
control frequency at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport late 
Thursday and told an aircraft to divert its landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone broke into the frequency at about 9:30 p.m. and said,  
``USAir divert, divert, divert your landing,'' according to 
WUSA-TV, which quoted several sources in its report. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot of a United Airlines aircraft, on its final approach  
to Reagan National, reportedly contacted the tower to find out what 
to do and was told to complete the approach, the station reported. 
</P>
<P>
	A US Airways pilot further back also called the tower and was  
told to circle the airport. Both planes landed safely. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Peters, an FAA spokesman, told The Associated Press the  
incident is under investigation but would not discuss the details.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Development Program Chief OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The General Assembly approved the  
selection Friday of Mark Malloch Brown, a World Bank executive, as 
the new chief of the U.N. Development Program. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, a British national, replaces James Gustave Speth, an  
American who announced in September that he would leave the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union had been pushing to take over the UNDP from  
the Americans, arguing Washington shouldn't continue to have the 
top spot while it cuts its contributions to the agency, the world's 
largest source of grants for development. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he would be an advocate for development. Speaking at  
a news conference, he pledged to form a ``partnership of equals'' 
between the agency and the World Bank, where he is vice president 
for external affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown comes into the job with substantial U.N. experience. He is  
a vice president of United Nations Affairs and worked for the U.N. 
High Commissioner for Refugees in Thailand and Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	Denmark's development minister, Poul Nielson, had been  
considered a leading contender for the job. But U.N. officials say 
Nielson hadn't won the widespread backing of the European Union and 
that Malloch Brown was more of a compromise candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary-General Kofi Annan paid tribute to Speth in a news  
conference Friday, saying he had helped reform the United Nations 
in his six-year tenure and had revitalized the agency, which 
operates in 134 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have relied heavily on him to move the reform forward -- and  
my confidence has clearly been shared by donor governments, 12 of 
which have pledged to increase their contributions to UNDP this 
year,'' Annan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency has been battling to keep donations coming at a time  
when governments are tightening their aid budgets around the world.

<HEADLINE>  Police Obtain School Security Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The governor toured Columbine High  
School today and emerged saying investigators were all but certain 
that the two gunmen had help from others. Police said security 
cameras may provide crucial evidence of a conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are backpacks with bombs in there everywhere,'' Gov.  
Bill Owens said. ``The officers in there are convinced there had to 
be more people involved. There's just too much stuff in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time-lapse security cameras mounted throughout the school do not  
run continuously. and each tape goes back about a week, said 
sheriff's Lt. John Kiekbusch. He said authorities had not yet 
reviewed the tapes and did not know if the cameras were running 
during the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ideally they would show the movement and also the actual  
placement perhaps of some of the explosive devices, prior to the 
incident,'' Kiekbusch said. ``If that's the case we have got just 
very important evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials returned to campus today to continue scouring for  
hidden explosives a day after the discovery of a powerful bomb made 
from a 20-pound propane tank heightened suspicions that Eric 
Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, intended to destroy the school, 
and could have had help in assembling their arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may have had confederates,'' said sheriff's Sgt. Jim  
Parr. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, President Clinton announced $1.5 million in federal  
aid to help victims pay for funerals, medical expenses, lost wages 
and counseling. In Littleton, students stayed away, frightened and 
mourning. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 15 people, including gunmen Harris and Klebold, died  
in Tuesday's attack. Fourteen students remained hospitalized, 
including eight in critical or serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Explosives expert Sid Woodcock said propane explosives of the  
type found are ``fairly sophisticated.'' Just one bomb ``probably 
would have destroyed a good part of the school,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These subjects were not only on a killing rampage,'' said  
Sheriff John Stone. ``They were going to burn the school up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb was set up with an egg timer, matches and a model  
rocket fuse, said Lawrence Bettendorf, an Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms agent. When the timer went off, it would trigger the 
match, which would light the fuse and ignite a gas can next to the 
propane tank, He said he didn't know why it didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the large bomb, searches have turned up more than 30  
homemade explosives, including pipe bombs and crude hand grenades. 
More may still remain hidden, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sawed-off shotguns, one 9mm semi-automatic rifle and one  
semi-automatic handgun also have been found. 
</P>
<P>
	The weapons did not belong to either of the gunmen's parents,  
and may be difficult to trace because they may have passed through 
many hands before the teen-agers got them, Bettendorf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, documents said court-ordered evaluations of the  
suspects, compiled three months ago after they were caught breaking 
into a van last year, called Harris ``a bright young man who is 
likely to succeed in life'' and found Klebold had ``a great deal of 
potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine will be closed indefinitely. Other schools in the  
district reopened Thursday to tight security. 
</P>
<P>
	At rival Chatfield High School, jittery staff and students  
walked past armed guards to enter as classes reconvened. At one 
point, two bomb squad trucks sped to the school after an unattended 
backpack was found. Students needed parental permission to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't even go to the bathroom without permission, and then  
they time you,'' lamented Holly Bernside, 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County school administrators began trying to return  
normalcy to Columbine students' lives by scouting for alternative 
class sites and planning events like graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The students are saying, `We want to be back together. We want  
to be in school. We want to be with our teachers,''' said 
Superintendent Jane Hammond. Hammond said students will return to 
the same school building next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold and Harris, members of the disaffected ``Trenchcoat  
Mafia'' at Columbine High, finished a juvenile court program 
successfully in February, clearing their records. The county 
district court released copies of the documents, but blacked out 
the officer's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were questioning classmates and others who knew  
the gunmen. Two fellow members of the Trenchcoat Mafia apologized 
to mourners on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no sign they would do this,'' sobbed Nicole Makham.  
``We would just like to say that we're sorry for what they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Columbine grounds Thursday, there was some hint of the  
crisis lifting. Teachers trickled in to retrieve their cars; an 
investigator rescued 30 baby chicks and a lizard from a science 
lab. 
</P>
<P>
	A mile away, Attorney General Janet Reno commiserated with  
relatives and community leaders as family members prepared for a 
weekend of memorials. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not something that is dealt with in a day or a week or  
a month,'' Reno said. ``This, as we have learned from Oklahoma City 
and other tragedies, is something that must be dealt with over 
time, and we are in this for the long haul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other shooting-related developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Student Bree Pasquale said her life was spared when gunman  
Harris's nose was bloodied by a ricocheting shotgun shell. Harris 
had put a gun to her head and told her she was next when the injury 
distracted him, she told NBC's ``Today'' show this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	--Investigators confirmed they had found a note at one suspect's  
home but refused to discuss its contents. 
</P>
<P>
	--The sheriff's office said it planned to release tapes of some  
911 calls today. 
</P>
<P>
	--Classmates said Klebold and Harris made several class-project  
videos last fall foreshadowing their spasm of violence. In one, 
``they had their friends pretend to be the jocks, and they 
pretended to be the gunmen shooting them,'' high school junior 
Chris Reilly told the Denver Rocky Mountain News. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials said they hadn't yet determined whether such a  
video was made. 
</P>
<P>
	--Police defended their initial response to the school massacre.  
They insisted they were rescuing students within minutes of the 
first 911 call but had to move cautiously because of the danger of 
bombs and bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	--The FBI sent a subpoena to America Online, seeking information  
on Web sites and member profiles thought to belong to Harris or 
Klebold.

<HEADLINE> Intel Makes Big Move to Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Computer chip maker Intel Corp., recognizing  
that there are billions of dollars to be made on the Internet, is 
planning a big move online by creating a data-services center. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel itself will not become an Internet service provider, but  
it will provide outsourcing services to those companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Santa Clara, Calif.-based microprocessor giant will set up  
data centers with thousands of powerful computers known as servers 
to provide data processing, storage and other computing services 
for companies that connect users to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel chief executive officer Craig Barrett told the Wall Street  
Journal that the company is taking advantage of the rapid growth of 
electronic commerce to position itself as the ``building-block 
supplier to the Internet economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gerhard Parker, a longtime manufacturing executive who was  
appointed to head Intel's new business ventures last year, told the 
Journal that the new venture will likely bring Intel into 
competition with companies such as IBM Corp. and Electronic Data 
Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts told The New York Times Intel is a late entrant  
into the market, far behind IBM and Exodus Communications Inc., and 
doubt that the chip maker has any advantage in running data 
centers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Track Stars Look For Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Track and field's top stars Michael Johnson  
and Marion Jones are competing at the Penn Relays -- the 
best-attended meet in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, the world No. 1 in the 100- and 200-meter races and in  
the long jump, relishes the few opportunities she has to show off 
her talents without leaving the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not too often as American athletes, we can stay home and  
go to a track meet,'' Jones said Friday, one day before she and her 
Nike teammates were to compete in the 105th running of the Penn 
Relays. ``We love to compete in front of all the people and the 
Penn Relays is definitely a highlight for me and I'm sure probably 
for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, track and field is not a highlight for American sports  
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The sport appeared to receive a kick start just two years ago  
during the Atlanta Olympics, but much to the dismay of its 
athletes, since then, interest has steadily declined. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know growing up, watching the Penn Relays on television was  
a highlight, to see the young kids competing '' said Jones, a 
native of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the opportunity to see this event will be limited to  
those in attendance as no part of the three-day meet will be 
televised. The final day of competition at the Penn Relays often 
attracts crowds upwards of 40,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's the greatest track meet in America,'' said  
Johnson who is scheduled to run along with another world champion 
Maurice Greene in the 800 relay. ``It's always just a great crowd, 
a knowledgeable crowd about track and field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just fun to be able to walk into a stadium here in  
America for a track meet and see that many people in the stands. 
It's a great feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Greene, although the top runners come from the  
United States, there aren't enough chances to show the home folks 
how good they are. 
</P>
<P>
	``Give us the stages to run, and let us do our jobs,'' he said.  
``If they give us places to run and put out what we need to have a 
good meet, we'll do our jobs. It's up to us to bring in the fan 
base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson recognizes what the tradition of the Penn Relays means  
to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have people who have planned their schedules in the spring  
around the Penn Relays, so it's very important,'' Johnson said. 
``It's a very significant stop on the American circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The popularity of track around the world makes these stars more  
famous elsewhere, compared to at home where they can go virtually 
unrecognized. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more we're seen, the more we're known,'' Greene said.  
``We're seen all the time in Europe, that's why we're so well 
known.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes Down 37.51 at 10,689.67 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices ended narrowly mixed Friday in a  
session marked by profit-taking following Wall Street's three-day 
rally. AT&AMP;T's bold bid for cable operator MediaOne sent the 
company's stock tumbling and broke a three-day winning streak in 
the Dow Jones industrials. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow ended 37.51 lower at 10,689.67, but it more than halved  
an earlier 80-point loss. The blue chips rose 145 points Thursday 
to 10,727.18, their 10th record high close in 14 sessions. The Dow 
rose 195.78 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indexes were mixed. A strong day for technology  
stocks pushed the Nasdaq composite up 29.08 to 2,590.69, very close 
to its record close of 2,598.81 on April 12. But the Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 index fell 1.97 to 1,356.85. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors continued their shift back into technology stocks  
after selling them aggressively on Monday. ``You have to give 
credit today to the market's backbone, the Internet stocks,'' said 
Bryan Piskorowski, market analyst at Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com rose 20 1/16 to 210 1/8 and eBay rose 8 1/16 to 104 1/16  
in Nasdaq trading, both on anticipation of strong earnings reports 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	But AT&AMP;T, a Dow component, slid 3 3/8 to 53 3/8 after news of its $58  
billion hostile bid for MediaOne, the nation's fourth-largest cable 
operator. AT&AMP;T is trying to thwart a merger agreement reached last 
month between MediaOne and No. 3 cable television company Comcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors worry that the deal could hurt AT&AMP;T's earnings.  
</P>
<P>
	``This deal spooks the market a little bit because AT&AMP;T has been  
one of the better performing stocks and there is concern about how 
this will affect it,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief investment 
strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co., in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think fundamentally this positions AT&AMP;T tremendously for the  
longer term,'' he said. ``Today, we are seeing a knee-jerk 
reaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks turned higher after a weak morning that saw  
profit-taking from three days of big gains. IBM closed up 5 1/4 to 
199 3/4 after reaching a new high of 206 5/8, extending a 13 percent gain 
Thursday as the market responded to IBM's strong earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway 2000, however, fell 7/16 to 69 1/2, even after the personal  
computer maker issued a strong earnings report late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A good profit report also failed to help Merck, which fell 2 1/8 to  
75 3/4. The drug maker posted first-quarter earnings that, as 
expected, showed growth over year-earlier performance. 
</P>
<P>
	And Mobil fell 7/16 to 99 7/8, even though the oil company's  
first-quarter performance proved not as dismal as some analysts 
were anticipating. Oil stocks generally were lower as crude oil 
futures, which had climbed above $18 per barrel on Thursday, 
slipped lower Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancers narrowly outpaced decliners on the Big Board, where  
consolidated volume was heavy at 904.43 million shares but below 
Thursday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 1.67 to 639.30, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 11.98 to 770.36. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.88 to 431.73.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Nuggets Resume Play After Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Three days after the shooting tragedy at a  
suburban Denver high school, it was time to begin the arduous 
process of getting back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Nuggets, who postponed a game on Tuesday because of  
the shootings, entertained the Golden State Warriors on Friday 
night in the first home game by a Denver professional sports team 
since the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the time to play,'' Nuggets guard Bryant Stith said  
before the contest. ``Hopefully, we can get out on the court and 
provide some enjoyment and some excitement that has been missing 
lately. We'd like to alleviate some of the pressure and stress that 
has been put on this community, especially the young people here in 
Colorado.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stith said the shootings, which left 15 dead and 23 wounded,  
have been difficult for the Nuggets to deal with as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you see young people and their lives shot up the way  
it was this week makes it difficult,'' he said. ``I'm a father of 
three myself, and it really hit home. These are the things I take a 
special interest in because my kids will be in this environment 
soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver guard Chauncey Billups, who starred at Denver's George  
Washington High School and played some games at Columbine High 
School, the scene of the shootings, said, ``I'm from Denver, so it 
really hit home for me. I can't imagine this happening anywhere, 
let alone in my hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we can give the fans a fitting show to get their minds  
off everything, to give them something to think about other than 
this tragedy. I'm just happy to get back to playing so I can start 
getting the juices flowing again and get this tragedy off my mind, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a show of support for the families and friends of the  
victims, the Nuggets wore black patches on the shoulders of their 
uniforms, a tribute that will continue through the remainder of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will let people know we're thinking about them,'' Nuggets  
forward Eric Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to tipoff, Nuggets chaplain Bo Mitchell asked players and  
coaches from both teams to join him at midcourt, where he offered a 
brief prayer. He also said the Nuggets were dedicating the rest of 
their season to individuals affected by the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Most fans agreed with the decision to postpone games and resume  
play on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good time to start back up,'' said Tony Stajeuhar of  
Highlands Ranch, Colo. ``Everybody gave the appropriate time and 
respect to the people who were killed or wounded. You have to move 
on with life eventually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Myers of Lafayette, Colo., who has two daughters attending  
high school, said, ``I think it's certainly time to get back to 
normal and move on with activities that bring a community together 
in another way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But one fan, Kyle Kacerha, 20, of Simla, Colo., said, ``It's too  
soon. I think this should be a time for the people to recuperate 
and think about the tragedy of the past week. I agreed with the 
cancellations. I thought it was a nice gesture on the part of the 
three pro teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuggets postponed Tuesday's game against Portland, which was  
scheduled to have started about eight hours after the rampage 
began, and rescheduled it for May 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Rockies postponed two baseball games, and the  
Colorado Avalanche postponed two NHL playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies resumed playing Thursday in San Francisco. The  
Avalanche will begin their first-round playoff series Saturday 
night in San Jose.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Victims Had Big Dreams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Michelle Oetter sat in the cab of her  
boyfriend's beat-up Chevy pickup, just as if she was on a date. 
</P>
<P>
	But she wasn't holding hands with John Tomlin or talking about  
their plans for attending the prom next week. She was instead 
surrounded by bouquets of flowers and sympathy notes, holding the 
hand of her mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``He loved ice cream and M&AMP;Ms,'' Oetter said Thursday, her eyes  
red-rimmed. ``He loved his truck, the outdoors and Wisconsin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomlin was among the 12 students slain Tuesday at Columbine High  
School. Oetter was to attend a memorial service for Tomlin today 
while his funeral was being arranged in his native Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of the deceased released Thursday included football  
players and thespians, weightlifters and debaters, techies and 
poets, and the two students -- Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold -- who 
killed them before shooting themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Corey DePooter, 17, was a former wrestler. He quit the school  
team so he could take a maintenance job at a golf club and save 
money for a fishing boat. He died hiding under a library table with 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Kechter, 16, was a junior football player with an A  
average who alternated on the offensive and defensive lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren Townsend, 18, was captain of the girls' volleyball team.  
Teammates said she was consumed by the sport, but she also was a 
member of the National Honor Society and a valedictorian candidate 
at her graduation next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Mauser, 15, was thin, bespectacled and shy. He ran cross  
country. 
</P>
<P>
	All athletes. The killers declared they were hunting ``jocks,''  
and they found several. 
</P>
<P>
	Isaiah Shoels, 18, reportedly was singled out because he was  
black as well as a football player. 
</P>
<P>
	He wanted to be a music executive and talent scout like his  
father. The teen-ager survived open-heart surgery as a boy and, 
while only 5-foot-4, played football and wrestled. He could 
bench-press twice his weight. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a popular figure at the overwhelmingly white high school.  
But Shoels had previously been threatened by the shooters' clique, 
the Trenchcoat Mafia. He and his sister, also a Columbine student, 
had complained to their parents and to school officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the victims were religious, and more than one was  
executed as they prayed for their lives to be spared. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassie Bernall, 17, once considered life as bleakly as her  
killers. Friends and counselors said she was fascinated by 
witchcraft and suicide when she was in middle school. But she found 
God two years ago. She carried a Bible and had a bracelet engraved 
with ``What Would Jesus Do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rachel Scott, 17, wanted to be a missionary in Africa. She  
choreographed Christian music in her own theatrical productions. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomlin, 16, went to Juarez, Mexico, last year on a Christian  
mission to build houses for the poor. He planned to enlist in the 
Army after high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Curnow, 14, dreamed of being a Navy top gun, piloting an  
F-16. He watched the ``Star Wars'' movies so many times he could 
recite the dialogue along with the actors. 
</P>
<P>
	Some were newcomers to Columbine.  
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Fleming, 16, moved to Littleton 18 months ago from  
Phoenix. She turned to writing song lyrics and fiction to express 
her feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard to uproot,'' said her mother, Diedra. ``But Kelly  
had made several good friends. She was your basic, normal, 
beautiful teen-age girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least two died trying to help others survive.  
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Rohrbough, 15, was shot as he held an exit door open for  
other students. He died on the sidewalk, a few steps from safety. 
He helped his father in his electronics business and was fascinated 
by computer games, stereos and home theater systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The only adult among the victims was William ``Dave'' Sanders,  
47, a computer and business teacher at Columbine for 24 years and 
coach of the girl's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Students said Sanders, married with five grandchildren, had been  
shot twice in the chest while shielding students fleeing down a 
hallway. 
</P>
<P>
	He stumbled into a science classroom, coughing blood. Students  
said he grew cold and repeated, ``I'm not going to make it.'' They 
pulled out his wallet and held it open so he could see the pictures 
of his wife and daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell my girls I love them,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Kellogg Profits Fall 26 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- Kellogg Co. reported Friday its  
first-quarter earnings fell 26 percent, but the cereal maker, 
trying to regain lost market share, pointed to an increase in sales 
as an indicator of future growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg said that excluding one-time charges, it earned $144.4  
million, or 36 cents a share, compared with $170.7 million, or 42 
cents a share, for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's per-share results were a penny over the consensus  
of analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	When one times charges related to previously-announced work  
force cuts are factored in, Kellogg earned $118.8 million, or 29 
cents a share, a 30 percent drop from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose to $1.75 billion from $1.64 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg has lost market share in recent years amid competition  
from cheaper supermarket brands, and has also seen sales drop as 
Americans eat less cereal and more bagels and muffins for 
breakfast. It has been restructuring over the past year, cutting 
nearly 800 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our first quarter results represent progress in returning  
Kellogg Co. to growth,'' chairman Arnold G. Langbo said in a news 
release. ``We invested heavily in all our major cereal markets 
during the quarter, contributing to our overall increase in both 
sales and volume.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John McMillin, an analyst with Prudential Securities in New  
York, said the earnings drop was expected. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the sales increase is worth noting, McMillin said it  
should be kept in perspective since Kellogg has lost market share 
in recent years and still has a lot of catching up to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``This company has been losing market share for a decade. I  
think this company is in as bad a shape as GM was a decade or so 
ago, when Japanese cars were ruling the world,'' McMillin said, but 
added that the sales growth is ``a first step in the right 
direction.''

<HEADLINE>  Flyers Rely on Checking Vs. Leafs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers are employing an ancient  
strategy against the Toronto Maple Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
	It has worked so often in the past that Flyers coach Roger  
Neilson, searching for a winning solution with captain Eric Lindros 
lost to injury, eagerly adopted it. 
</P>
<P>
	It is quite simple: outplay the opposition defensively and  
victory is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the playoffs, you win with strong checking, and that's what  
we're trying to do,'' Neilson said before his team practiced Friday 
to prepare for Game 2 of the first-round series Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Neilson has been relentless in driving the point home to his  
players, who are constantly being told they can do a better job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Toronto has a top offensive team so it isn't easy, but we've  
got to do a better job checking,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Leafs have had trouble against such strategy all season.  
They were the highest-scoring team in the NHL, but their losing 
record against tight-checking Eastern Conference teams was a matter 
of record Neilson has not overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	John Vanbiesbrouck was on the top of his game in a 3-0 shutout  
victory in Game 1 Thursday night, but some of the credit also has 
to go to a Philadelphia defensive corps that has been chided by 
analysts as being too slow. But most times the Leafs fired the puck 
into Philadelphia's zone in Game 1, it was out in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know we don't have a slow defense,'' Flyers defenseman Chris  
Therien. ``I'm a tall guy but I don't think by any means I'm slow 
or Dan McGillis is slow. 
</P>
<P>
	``No way. We've got (Adam) Burt, (Dmitri) Tertyshny, Eric  
Desjardins and Steve Duchesne, and they're all good-skating 
defensemen. People want to say we're slow, that's fine. That's what 
they want to say, but I don't believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 396 best-of-7 series played in NHL history, the club  
winning Game 1 has gone on to win the series 70 percent of the time 
(276-120), including 13 of 15 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still the underdog in the series,'' Therien said. ``They  
do have a lot of speed but we have our style, which is a 
strong-checking defensive style that we believe is going to help us 
win hockey games in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the system Roger has installed and we believe it is the  
key to winning playoff games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Leafs insist they'll win with speed and offense. Forward  
Derek King said his team has to turn the puck over less frequently 
and pepper more shots at Vanbiesbrouck, who stopped the 25 he faced 
in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our biggest thing is we have to skate and move the puck a lot  
better than we did,'' King said. ``We have to put the same pressure 
on him and hope he buckles. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we throw some speed at them and get a win, we'll change  
this series around.''

<HEADLINE> Talk-Show Case Hears Ex-Girlfriend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A man accused of shooting a fellow  
talk-show guest over the revelation of a same-sex crush had a 
history of depression and attempted suicides, friends and relatives 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Schmitz, according to a former girlfriend, sometimes  
became violent and abused alcohol when he was depressed. Employers 
said he was a model worker before the taping of ``The Jenny Jones 
Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the segment, which never aired, Scott Amedure revealed he had  
a secret crush on the avowedly heterosexual Schmitz. Three days 
after the March 6, 1995, taping, Schmitz fatally shot Amedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz had said he expected to meet a female admirer. He was  
not told the show dealt with same-sex crushes. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure's family is suing the show, its production company,  
Telepictures Inc. and its distributor, Warner Bros., for $50 
million. They claim the show drove the already unbalanced Schmitz 
to kill. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Glavin, the show's executive producer, testified Friday that  
producers avoided any guests they thought might be unbalanced. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't put people on the show who look like they have  
something wrong with them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz's former girlfriend, Kristin Joyce, testified Thursday  
that she and Schmitz met in 1989, when he was 19 and she was 20. 
They lived together for four years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In their time together, she testified, Schmitz would have  
repeated bouts of depression. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would shut himself off from everyone,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	During the bouts, he would become suspicious of others,  
suspecting her of cheating and worrying that people were staring at 
him, Ms. Joyce said. While depressed, he would go on drinking 
binges and would smoke marijuana, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz also would turn violent -- punching or kicking walls and  
several times striking her, Ms. Joyce said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a violent episode on Christmas Eve 1993, Ms. Joyce said  
she made Schmitz promise to get psychiatric help. The 
antidepressant Zoloft helped, but later he stopped taking the 
medication and she broke up with him in June 1994, Ms. Joyce said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't mad at him -- I couldn't be mad at him -- because he  
was mentally ill,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz' sister, Jennifer Yeokum, testified that he told her he  
hoped the admirer on the show was Ms. Joyce. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she also feared Schmitz would try to kill himself --  
something he had attempted three times before -- after being 
surprised by Amedure on the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz, who worked as a waiter, was a punctual, efficient  
worker who, after the taping of the show, became withdrawn and 
absent-minded, according to the restaurant's co-owner, Kevin 
Downey. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz, 28, was convicted of second-degree murder. His  
conviction was reversed on a technicality; his retrial is set for 
Aug. 19.

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio Honored at N.Y. Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Joe DiMaggio received a standing ovation at St.  
Patrick's Cathedral today and was remembered as the ultimate team 
player and peerless leader of the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the team leader, but he didn't give pep talks or  
speeches,'' said Bobby Brown, a former teammate who became 
president of the American League. ``He set for himself the highest 
standards and he expected his teammates to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``If at anytime you did not give your best effort, you got a  
look that froze you in your tracks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown spoke from the altar during a memorial service packed with  
fans, friends and celebrities. DiMaggio, a Hall of Fame outfielder, 
died of complications from lung cancer March 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinal John O'Connor, who officiated during the hour-long  
service, said DiMaggio had attended Mass at the cathedral. He 
recalled the last time he saw DiMaggio sitting in a pew. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was greeted with wild applause,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	At end of the service, at O'Connor's request, the audience gave  
DiMaggio's memory a sustained standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who joined in were Yankees owner George Steinbrenner  
and DiMaggio teammate Yogi Berra, who sat next to each other in a 
row that included Henry Kissinger. Behind them was Phil Rizzuto, 
another Yankees' Hall of Famer. 
</P>
<P>
	Other celebrities included Woody Allen and singer Michael  
Bolton. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani recalled that the first major  
league game he ever saw was the Yankees against Boston at Yankee 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe was in center field for the Yankees and Dom DiMaggio was  
in center fielder for the Red Sox. Each hit a single to each 
other,'' Giuliani said. ``I couldn't figure out how two brothers 
played on different teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Patrick's has become known as the Yankees' cathedral.  
</P>
<P>
	Babe Ruth and Billy Martin had funeral Masses there, and the  
cathedral was the setting for a memorial Mass for Roger Maris. 
Longtime Yankees broadcaster Mel Allen was remembered in a prayer 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to give him the kind of a sendoff he wanted ...  
first class for a first class man,'' said Dr. Rock Positano, who 
helped arrange today's service for DiMaggio 
</P>
<P>
	The service started a weekend that will culminate Sunday with  
the unveiling of a granite and bronze monument to the Yankee 
Clipper at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the same people at the memorial service will participate  
in the ceremony at the stadium's Memorial Park, which also includes 
monuments to Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle and Miller Huggins, 
who managed the Yankees from 1918-29. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Simon, whose 1968 ``Mrs. Robinson'' includes the line  
``Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio?'' will sing the song during the 
unveiling ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also a tribute to DiMaggio on Wednesday in Hollywood,  
Fla., where a park was dedicated in his memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown noted that the Yankees won 10 American League pennants and  
nine World Series championships during DiMaggio's 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``What separated the Yankees from the other great teams that we  
beat was Joe,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Congress Reacts to School Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Angry that their gun-control proposals have  
stalled, Democratic lawmakers hope the killings at a Colorado high 
school will spur the public to demand meaningful legislation from 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Voices from the American people are starting to rise. People  
are starting to say, `Wait a minute,''' Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, 
D-N.Y., said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy, who might still be a nurse on New York's Long Island  
but for her personal run-in with gun violence, said she would use 
procedural means, if necessary, to force a vote on her bill if 
House Republican leaders continue to block it. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband and five other passengers were killed in a 1993  
shooting on a commuter train. She became an outspoken gun-control 
advocate after the attack, which also severely wounded her son, and 
was elected to the House in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy's bill, which would require new safety features on  
guns, among other things, died in the last Congress. She said she 
asked House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., for support in a 
conversation Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he would look at it and he would get back to me,'' she  
said at a news conference. ``I'm hoping that he'll be reasonable. 
We're asking for a debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., who was an original co-sponsor of  
the bill when McCarthy first introduced it, reiterated her support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to redouble my efforts to get additional  
co-sponsors and to use our influence with Speaker Hastert ... to 
get the bill to the floor,'' Roukema said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration echoed McCarthy's sentiments.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope ... one of the positive things that would come  
out of this very tragic event in Littleton would be the passage of 
the legislation that we will be proposing again,'' Deputy Attorney 
General Eric Holder said. ``The vast majority of the American 
people support reasonable restrictions on the possession of guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said today he was  
willing to ``look at all options'' but that gun control ``can't be 
the only solution.'' He specifically rejected the idea of requiring 
that guns be locked to prevent children from getting to them. ``I 
don't know how you enforce something like that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A package of gun-control bills, some of which failed in past  
sessions of the Republican-controlled Congress, will be sent to 
Capitol Hill soon, Holder said. One idea under consideration would 
extend federal prohibitions on gun possession to people who 
committed violent crimes as juveniles. The current ban applies only 
to adult convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association, which opposes such efforts on  
grounds that they will interfere with the constitutional right to 
bear arms, refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now the only appropriate response is one of grief and  
sorrow and prayers for the community and anything that extends 
beyond that right now is not appropriate,'' NRA spokesman Bill 
Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, meanwhile, more than 40 gun-control bills are  
pending, said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who is sponsoring 
one to ban the import and sale of ammunition magazines that hold 10 
or more rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time to break the NRA's lock on the Congress,'' she  
said. ``If this incident doesn't galvanize America, what will?'' 
</P>
<P>
	An emotional McCarthy said Congress has waited too long to  
fulfill its ``moral obligation'' to protect children. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nation is crying out for answers,'' she said. ``I am not  
willing to wait any longer for another shooting.''

<HEADLINE> Hyundai To Pare Number of Divisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Under government pressure, heavily  
indebted Hyundai Group plans to reduce the number of its 
subsidiaries to 26 from 79 by 2003 through sales and mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest conglomerate said it would concentrate on  
five key sectors -- automobiles, shipbuilding, 
construction-engineering, electronics and finance. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai officials said today the conglomerate will eventually be  
broken into five groups to handle each of the core businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai, along with another conglomerate, Daewoo, has been under  
mounting government pressure to trim its business portfolio and 
narrow its focus. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo, the nation's second largest conglomerate, unveiled plans  
earlier this week to sell its shipbuilding and 25 other 
subsidiaries by October to improve its financial position and focus 
on carmaking and finance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The restructuring will completely change the face of  
Hyundai,'' Park Se-yong, head of the group's corporate 
restructuring committee, told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Also announced at the news conference was the conclusion of a  
deal that allows Hyundai to buy a computer memory chip-making arm 
of LG group for $2.13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, wrapped up late Thursday after months of negotiations,  
calls for Hyundai to pay LG Semicon $1.3 billion immediately and 
the remainder in five installments by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition will make Hyundai Electronics Co. the world's  
largest memory chip producer with an estimated 20.8 percent share 
of the world market. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai officials said the restructuring aims to reduce their  
group's total debt to $2.7 billion from $6.5 billion by the end of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of Hyundai subsidiaries to be sold, spun off or merged  
includes several profitable steel making, petrochemical and 
aluminum plants as well as smaller plants. 
</P>
<P>
	As in the case of Daewoo, Hyundai's plan drew applause from the  
government but skepticism from economists and analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts expressed doubt that Hyundai will be able to find  
buyers for its assets. They noted that most past promises by the 
nation's top conglomerates went unfulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of restructuring by Hyundai and Daewoo came  
days after President Kim Dae-jung urged vigorous corporate 
restructuring to improve efficiency and boost foreign investors' 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has focused his criticism on the country's top  
five conglomerates -- Daewoo, Hyundai, Samsung, LG and SK -- each of 
which controls 40 to 70 subsidiaries, making everything from 
computer chips to cars and ships. 
</P>
<P>
	When the economy slowed in 1996-1997, about a dozen  
conglomerates collapsed under their debt load, leaving banks with 
mounds of non-performing loans that caused a sudden loss of 
confidence and triggered a flight of foreign capital. 
</P>
<P>
	That forced South Korea to accept a record $58 billion bailout  
from the International Monetary Fund in late 1997. Structural 
economic reforms were a key condition of the rescue package. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Korean economy shrank 5.8 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Marketing Firm Hits Snag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The sports marketing firm hired this week  
to sell sponsorships for the financially troubled 2002 Winter 
Olympics may have a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	International Management Group represents two companies that are  
already sponsors of the Salt Lake City Games, as well as two other 
companies that are considering signing on. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those companies, US WEST, is reviewing its relationship  
with IMG in light of the deal announced late Tuesday with the joint 
marketing arm of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee and the U.S. 
Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little surprising,'' said Randy Lynch, vice president  
of Olympic programs for US WEST. The US WEST account is supervised 
by Rob Prazmark, the same IMG vice president who'll direct sales 
for the 2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch said that although the telecommunications company was  
assured by Prazmark there was not a conflict of interest, ``we are 
evaluating whether we believe there is or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is whether Prazmark and IMG can represent the best  
interests of both the sponsors and the organization the sponsors 
are paying millions of dollars to, Olympic Properties of the United 
States, or OPUS. 
</P>
<P>
	US WEST and Texaco, the other sponsor involved, have cemented  
their Olympic sponsorships. But they still need approval from OPUS 
for their marketing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Prazmark said he can do both jobs well. The organizing committee  
and the USOC said they're satisfied with his answer now that their 
lawyers have examined the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	John Krimsky, the deputy secretary general of the USOC and the  
head of the joint marketing effort, said his lawyers ``didn't feel 
it to be a conflict as long as there is full disclosure and there 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prazmark said he's agreed not to take on any more sponsors as  
clients and has been assigned specific product categories by OPUS 
that don't conflict with any of his existing clients. 
</P>
<P>
	OPUS is $300 million short of its goal of raising $859 million  
in contributions and in-kind services. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC officials blamed the Salt Lake bribery scandal for the  
marketing woes, while some officials connected with the Salt Lake 
organizing effort have said that the marketing was going slowly 
even before the scandal hit late last year.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Car Production Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Production at three leading Japanese automakers  
fell sharply in fiscal 1998 as slumping domestic demand caused the 
companies to scale back operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Friday's reports from the automakers suggest that  
the industry's output is likely to have fallen below 10 million 
vehicles for the fiscal year ended March 31 -- the lowest in 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association will release  
industry production figures on Monday. The association said earlier 
this month that Japanese auto sales fell 11.2 percent last fiscal 
year to 4.21 million vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's auto industry has been one of the hardest hit by the  
country's recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Co., Japan's biggest automaker, said Friday its  
production fell 3.6 percent to about 4.6 million vehicles last 
fiscal year. Overall output at Toyota was slightly up in March, 
rising 0.6 percent to 447,853. 
</P>
<P>
	At Nissan Motor Co., the country's second largest carmaker,  
production declined 10.5 percent in fiscal 1998 to 2.5 million 
vehicles. The company's production retreated 9.2 percent to 233,036 
vehicles in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Motor Co. said that its auto output in fiscal 1998  
dropped 12.6 percent to about 1.7 million vehicles. Its March 
production was up 15.1 percent to 177,815. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports were also down last year at Japanese car companies.  
Toyota said its exports fell 3.7 percent to 354,876 vehicles; 
Nissan's exports were down 0.1 percent to 710,845; and Mitsubishi's 
dropped 8.1 percent to 511,349.

<HEADLINE> National TV Turnoff Week Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's not just mom nagging kids to turn off the  
TV and go outside and play. Now the government is joining in. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeon General David Satcher has thrown his support to National  
TV Turnoff Week, a usually little-noticed yearly effort to wean 
people of excessive tube watching. This year's TV Turnoff Week 
began Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Satcher, worried about an epidemic of obesity, said it would  
help to get up off the couch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the most sedentary generation of young people in  
American history,'' he said. ``Reducing the amount of television 
our children watch is one way to encourage more healthful 
activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through some schools, Satcher is distributing a ``prescription  
for less TV'' and urging parents to tape it in front of the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor's prescription: ``Go bicycling, play soccer, jump  
rope, fly a kite, dance, start a garden, wash the dog, swim laps, 
clean your room, do gymnastics, throw a Frisbee, walk around the 
block, learn to rollerskate, build a fort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Satcher's endorsement was a pleasant surprise to TV-Free  
America, the Washington advocacy group that has spearheaded 
National TV Turnoff Week for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government had never been involved before Satcher  
and Shirley Watkins, the undersecretary of agriculture for food, 
nutrition and consumer services, asked if they could endorse the 
effort, said Henry Labalme, executive director of TV-Free America. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real watershed to have someone of Dr. Satcher's stature  
and influence and authority make the statement that Americans 
really need to cut back on their tube time for health reasons,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Labalme estimated that 6 million people have pledged through  
schools, libraries and religious groups to go without TV for the 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	His group says TV increases obesity, stifles creativity and  
shortens attention spans among young people. Nielsen Media Research 
estimated the average American TV viewer watched four hours and 
nine minutes of TV each day in March. 
</P>
<P>
	TV networks have never noticed a falloff in viewers during past  
TV Turnoff weeks, said David Poltrack, chief researcher at CBS. In 
fact, during some of the weeks, viewership has actually been above 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything that doesn't discriminate and says that for a period  
of time you should watch no television is basically 
self-defeating,'' Poltrack said. ``There's no justification with 
all the good quality programming on television to call for a 
blanket boycott.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An executive with the popular childrens' cable network  
Nickelodeon said she supports the surgeon general's effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickelodeon occasionally runs a public service announcement  
called ``Actual Reality,'' encouraging children to experience life 
instead of watching televised versions of it, said Cyma Zarghami, 
Nick's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said it wasn't fair to blame Nick for sedentary kids.  
Studies show kids watch about the same amount of TV as they have 
for the past several years, Zarghami said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we're here as a great alternative for kids,'' she  
said. ``If we weren't here, they wouldn't necessarily be outside 
playing sports.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Uses Summit for Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton claimed NATO's 50th  
anniversary summit as an opportunity to head a marquee of world 
leaders and prove -- past personal problems aside -- he is capable of 
leading the alliance in the Kosovo military campaign and into the 
new century. 
</P>
<P>
	``We meet to honor NATO's past, to chart its future, to reaffirm  
our mission in Kosovo, where NATO is defending our values and our 
vision of a Europe free, undivided and at peace,'' Clinton said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, sitting behind a plaque as the representative of  
``Etats-Unis,'' played host and helmsman of an international 
coalition battling against Yugoslavia over Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was Clinton's turn to address the private meeting of  
NATO allies, a U.S. official in the glassy, octagonal pavilion of 
Washington's new International Trade Center said Clinton tossed 
aside the nine-page text his aides had prepared. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign delegation members who had drifted around the room  
during the dozen or so presentations preceding Clinton, took their 
seats for the seven minutes that he spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to win,'' Clinton said of the war with Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic. ``We need to win together. We've 
started together and we will finish together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, Clinton's four hours of private talks with his NATO  
allies secured a declaration of resolve -- ``We will not allow this 
campaign of terror to succeed'' -- to defeat Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	But it still looked as if France, out of concern for the effects  
on Montenegro, would block consensus among the 19 NATO leaders on 
the question of an oil embargo or blockade to keep Milosevic from 
resupplying after allied airstrikes on his refineries. 
</P>
<P>
	By afternoon, once an elaborate commemoration ceremony  
concluded, Clinton pulled aside French President Jacques Chirac and 
won his assent for compromise language. The summit communique would 
order allied defense ministers to develop a plan for choke off 
Milosevic's oil. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last European dictatorship of the 20th century will not  
destroy Europe's long-awaited chance to live -- at last -- together 
in peace and freedom,'' Clinton said from the center of a 
red-carpeted stage at the commemoration. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the world's most powerful heads of government,  
diplomats, military officers and defense ministers had gathered in 
the Andrew Mellon Auditorium, with its grand columns -- the same 
room where President Truman and his Western counterparts signed the 
1949 treaty creating NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	The long ceremony seemed to take a toll on the president.  
</P>
<P>
	Through 90 minutes and 20 speeches, Clinton betrayed the  
eyes-drooping, head-sagging symptoms of a man dozing off. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, he put his chin in his hand, crossed and uncrossed  
his legs, propped his elbows on his knees. But nothing, not even 
the click-clicking of bemused photographers close by, could keep 
Clinton's eyes open. 
</P>
<P>
	But he sprang ramrod straight, and his face bore an envying  
expression, when his friend, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, 46, 
opened his remarks with the announcement: ``I am younger than 
NATO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The highly competitive Clinton is 52.

<HEADLINE> Invention May Stop Child Abductions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. (AP) -- You're never too young or too old to  
wear a beeper, according to some East Tennessee State University 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Babies and the elderly may soon be sporting the Safe Distance  
Locator Device, invented by an ETSU professor and a group of 
undergraduate engineering majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a multi-purpose product,'' said Mark Rajai, an ETSU  
associate professor and director of manufacturing engineering 
technology. ``It can be used when people wander off, and we hope it 
will stop child abductions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The device can help caregivers keep track of patients with  
Alzheimer's disease and the mentally disabled, Rajai said. Parents, 
day-care workers and hospital nursery personnel can use it to 
monitor youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	The device, about the diameter of a quarter, can be pinned to  
clothes or worn like a watch. It also has a ``panic button'' that 
can be pressed in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	The receiver, which resembles a baby monitor, is a hand-held  
device with red blinking lights. Parents can set it to emit a loud 
beeping sound when their child is out of a certain range, from 2 
feet to 400 feet away. One receiver can track up to 50 children. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent national study, published in 1990, showed that  
163,200 children are abducted by relatives each year, according to 
the Center for Missing &AMP; Exploited Children. 
</P>
<P>
	Rajai and the students have a one-year copyright protection on  
the device and hope to have a patent within a year. Rajai plans to 
fine tune and then market the equipment, which he said could be 
sold for about $40.

<P>
	Rain showers spread from the southern Great Lakes into the  
Northeast today, while low pressure delivered snow to the higher 
elevations of the Rockies from Wyoming to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	A cold front was expected to move slowly south over the eastern  
part of the country today, bringing showers and thunderstorms to 
the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states. Damaging winds were 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The same frontal boundary should produce rain and thunderstorms  
from the southern Great Lakes and Ohio Valley to the central and 
southern Plains. The worst of the storms could strike parts of 
Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Unsettled weather was forecast to continue over the West, with  
up to a foot of snow expected in the central Rockies. Rain was 
likely in the lower elevations and in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Partly cloudy skies and breezy conditions should dominate from  
the Northwest into southern California.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Prosecutor Speaks Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- District Attorney Dave Thomas stepped in  
front of the cameras today just as he had every morning, a 
prosecutor delivering cool updates about the school shooting 
investigation. But when his mouth opened, a different person spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, it was Dave Thomas, citizen, father of two Columbine  
High graduates, human being anguished about the bloodshed he had 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Thomas found a nationwide bully pulpit and used it to issue  
a demand to the nation: that the violence come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	He said America isn't taking care of its children. He wondered  
aloud about video games, movies, Dungeons &AMP; Dragons and how they 
influenced young people. And he urged everyone -- the media and the 
public -- to join him. 
</P>
<P>
	``These deaths cannot be in vain. We cannot walk away from here  
and wait for the next incident to occur,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For 20 minutes, the 50-year-old career law-enforcement officer  
held court before a live national audience, trying to understand 
why 14 young people and a teacher died violently inside a high 
school that graduated his own children, Justin and Carrie. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has to be some meaning to this,'' Thomas said.  
</P>
<P>
	He produced no good answers -- and admitted it. He even  
acknowledged that his emotion might be jarring. ``I'm not a 
zealot,'' he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not an important person,'' he said. ``I'm not the  
president. I'm not the attorney general. I'm not even the attorney 
general of Colorado. I'm just a person who's very very concerned 
about the deaths of these people. And I want to do something about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, a sedate man with a thin, angular face and tousled gray  
hair and mustache, has spent his entire life in Jefferson County. 
He worked his way up as a Denver prosecutor and an assistant U.S. 
attorney. He became Colorado's head of public safety in 1987, but 
returned to this Denver suburb in 1992 to become the district 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you saw today was the real Dave Thomas,'' said Bob Grant,  
Thomas' counterpart in Adams County, another collection of 
Denver-area suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think that we get numbed to it,'' Grant said. ``Some of  
us have seen a lot of man's inhumanity to man over the years. But 
you never get numbed. No matter how many autopsies you attend, no 
matter how many multiple homicide cases you're involved in, you 
never lose the sense of humanity if you're going to do the job 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Cohen, a Denver attorney and legal analyst, praised  
Thomas' candor and courage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thomas' remarks were more philosophical and emotional than  
we're used to hearing from our politicians and prosecutors,'' Cohen 
said. Thomas' feelings simply reflected his constituency. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's being honest when he says he doesn't have the answers,  
because none of us do,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	But that didn't stop Thomas from trying.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want my community ... to be remembered forever as the  
place where that terrible tragedy occurred,'' Thomas said. ``I want 
it to be remembered as the place where we started to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis, the other  
voice of the investigation, said he is having trouble sleeping. And 
virtually every SWAT team member and investigator is haunted by 
what they have seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough for them to go in there and see where 15 kids have  
lost their lives,'' Davis said, ``especially when they have kids of 
their own.''

<HEADLINE> Suits Filed Over Turnpike Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four young men who were shot at 11 times by New  
Jersey troopers after a traffic stop were handcuffed, forced to lie 
in a ditch and strip-searched before paramedics were allowed to 
help them, new lawsuits say. 
</P>
<P>
	Four civil rights and injury lawsuits were filed Thursday by  
former O.J. Simpson attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. on behalf of the 
three black men and one Hispanic man. 
</P>
<P>
	The case, involving two white troopers, has drawn national  
attention to the practice of ``racial profiling,'' or targeting of 
minorities, for traffic stops. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the men, Rayshawn Brown, 21, and Leroy Grant, 24, were  
asleep in the van when the troopers' bullets struck them April 23, 
1998, on the New Jersey Turnpike, according to the lawsuits. A 
third man, Danny Reyes, 21, was raising his hands and pleading not 
to be shot when Trooper James Kenna opened fire, the suits alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	The troopers said the van backed up in an attempt to hit them.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think this case is a catalyst more than anything else,''  
Cochran said at a New York City news conference. The suits were 
filed in state court in Trenton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The Black Ministers Council of New Jersey scheduled a protest  
rally in Trenton, N.J., to mark the anniversary of the shooting 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the New Jersey attorney general's office has issued a  
report confirming the existence of so-called racial profiling of 
minority motorists, Grant said New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman 
owes him something. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a parent, not as a political leader but that as a parent,  
why doesn't she come forward and give an apology for what had 
happened, knowing that racial profiling did exist all these years 
but was ignored,'' Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, Reyes and Brown still have bullets lodged in their bodies  
because it was medically unwise to remove them, the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a hard-fought year for all four of us,'' Grant  
said. ``We don't know why we got shot. We still don't know why the 
van got stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two troopers involved were indicted Monday on charges of  
falsifying traffic stop records to cover up the fact that they were 
stopping and searching mostly black motorists. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges were not directly related to the shooting.

<HEADLINE> US-China WTO Talks Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Top U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators conferred  
today after a second and seemingly inconclusive day of talks to 
remove the final obstacles to China's entry into the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Robert Cassidy and his  
Chinese counterpart, Long Yongtu, met for an hour late today in 
Long's office following a day of detailed talks between their 
aides, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agreed to meet again, but were unclear about the  
timing. Cassidy is scheduled to leave Beijing on Sunday, and the 
U.S. Embassy refused to comment on whether the talks would resume 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``China and the United States will continue their talks on the  
remaining issues of China's accession to the WTO in the future,'' 
Xinhua quoted Chinese negotiator Long as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassidy and Long are trying to build on a market-opening offer  
that Premier Zhu Rongji made in Washington two weeks ago but 
President Clinton rejected as insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	Few details about progress have emerged. Xinhua reported that  
Friday's discussions centered on trade in services and textiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is hoping to secure greater access to  
China's financial services sector and protections for U.S. steel 
and textile makers from Chinese imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu's Washington offer was the closest the United States and  
China have come to an agreement over 13 years of fitful 
negotiations on Beijing's entry to world trade's rule-making body. 
</P>
<P>
	American businesses, prodded by Zhu's lobbying during his  
six-city U.S. tour, urged the Clinton administration to strike a 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear how much of Zhu's offer remained on the table.  
His concessions threatened vested interests the Communist Party 
relies on for support, from provincial politicians to state 
industry managers.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department warned U.S. citizens  
today to stay away from the Democratic Republic of Congo and 
advised those in the African country to consider leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	American citizens, other people who speak English and travelers

<HEADLINE> Students Talk of Violence on MTV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Blaming the Colorado school massacre on gory  
video games and shock-rock music diverts attention from the anger 
and loneliness that may have pushed the teen-age gunmen over the 
edge, students say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like violence. I don't even like violent video games,  
but what caused those kids in Colorado to start shooting was that 
everyone was picking on them,'' said Tim Gooding, 13, who was 
wearing a T-shirt painted with bloody bullet holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooding was among about 100 students attending Thursday night's  
screening of ``Warning Signs,'' a 30-minute documentary about 
school violence produced by MTV. 
</P>
<P>
	He blamed school violence on parents and teachers who are  
``unable to stop kids from making fun of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MTV scheduled the screening of ``Warning Signs'' at Paramount  
Studios before Tuesday's shooting in Littleton, Colo., where two 
outcast high school students killed 12 students and one teacher 
before taking their own lives. Classmates described the gunmen as 
macabre ``Goths'' who played violent video games for hours and 
listened to Marilyn Manson. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussion at a forum held in conjunction with the screening  
focused mainly on the mistrust many of the youths feel for their 
parents, teachers and other authority figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a problem and the teachers are worried about whether  
I have my shirt tucked in,'' one student said to the crowd. ``How 
am I supposed to go to people like that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Student Marcus Lawrence said authorities also can overreact to  
troubled students. He told the crowd that many kids want to fight 
bullies out of anger but have no intention of committing serious 
harm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could think in my mind that I would kill them, but the sheer  
notion of somebody else in pain just bothers me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Psychologist Russ Newman, who sat on the forum panel, said  
parents and teachers often fail to take children's problems 
seriously, and instead blame violent behavior on media influences. 
</P>
<P>
	``Violence is a learned behavior,'' he said. ``Music and video  
games may also be part of it, but there are many factors involved 
in these incidents.''

<HEADLINE> Transcript of School Shooting Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Transcripts of emergency telephone calls made by a teacher at  
Columbine High School known only as Peggy in the library area and 
from a female student. Some portions were unintelligible. 

</P>
<P>
	Peggy: Yes, I'm a teacher at Columbine High School and there is  
a student here with a gun. He just shot out a window. I believe, 
um, I'm at Columbine High School. I don't know what's in my 
shoulder. If it was just some glass. I don't know what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: Has anyone been injured, ma'am?  
</P>
<P>
	Peggy: I am, yes! And the school is in a panic and I'm in the  
library. I've got students down. Kids under the table! My kids are 
screaming, under the table, kids, and my teachers are trying to 
take control of things. We need police here. 
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: OK, OK, we're getting them. Who is the student,  
ma'am? 
</P>
<P>
	Peggy: I don't know who the student is. I saw a student outside  
.... I said what was going on out there. (Talking to students) I 
don't think that's a really good idea. (Back to dispatcher) And we 
were waiting to see what was going on. He turned the gun straight 
at us and shot and my God, the window went out and the kid standing 
there with me, I think he got hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: OK, we got help on the way, ma'am.  
</P>
<P>
	Peggy: Oh God! Oh God! Kids, just stay down. Do we know where  
he's at? I'm in the library. He's upstairs. He's right outside of 
here. He's outside this hall. There are lines of people ... Kids, 
just stay down! Do we know where he's at? He's outside in the hall. 
There's alarms and things going off and smoke. (Yelling): My God, 
smoke is coming into this room. I've got the kids under a table. I 
don't know what's happening in the rest of the building. Shouldn't 
someone else be calling 911? 
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: Yes, we have a lot of people on. I need you to stay  
on the line with me. We need to know what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
	Peggy: I am on the floor.  
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: You've the kids there?  
</P>
<P>
	Peggy: I've got every student in this library on the floor.  
(Yelling): You guys just stay on the floor! 
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: Is there any way you can lock the doors?  
</P>
<P>
	Peggy: Um, smoke is coming in from out there and I'm a little  
... My God, it's ... (Sounds: Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang.) 
</P>
<P>
	My God, the gun is right outside my door. OK, I don't think I'm  
going to go out there. We're not going to go to the door. I've got 
the kids on the floor. I got all of the kids in the library on the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: We have paramedics and we have fire and we have  
police en route. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: Columbine Senior High School. There's been a  
shooting. There's a female in the south parking lot. OK, I'm sorry, 
can you tell me where she is? 
</P>
<P>
	Student: She's in the south parking lot on the lower parking  
lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: She's in the parking lot, the lower one?  
</P>
<P>
	Student: Right, toward the east end of that parking lot .... I  
just saw everyone running. I just saw the smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: OK. We had a report of explosions down there. Is  
there a car fire or anything? 
</P>
<P>
	Student: People are saying there's a gun.  
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: Do you know if anyone was carrying a weapon out  
there? 
</P>
<P>
	Student: No, I do not. There's like smoke going off in the  
parking lot right now. There are loud noises. I'm not sure exactly. 
A cop is pulling up. 
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: Can you direct them?  
</P>
<P>
	Student: No, but they're going in the right direction. People  
are running out of the school like mad right now. 
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: Where is the female ... is she still in that south  
parking lot? 
</P>
<P>
	Student: I can't see her anymore. I ran to the phone.  
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: Can you see anything else?  
</P>
<P>
	Student: A lot of people are at the front of the parking lot and  
they're running out. 
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: When the kids came out of the school, which  
direction were they going? 
</P>
<P>
	Student: They went down towards the street.  
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: What part is this? Is it like the gym area, the  
cafeteria or just classrooms? 
</P>
<P>
	Student: They're coming from like the commons, the lunch area  
right now. 
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: The commons area?  
</P>
<P>
	Student: Everyone's running and I'm still standing here.  
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: You're out of the way of danger, aren't you?  
</P>
<P>
	Student: I believe so, I don't know.  
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: Do you mind if I keep you on the phone here so you  
can tell me if anything else is going on there? 
</P>
<P>
	Student: I think the fire alarm is going off right now. Yeah,  
the fire alarm is going off.

<HEADLINE> Dangling Teen Inspired SWAT Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- It was one of the most frightening  
scenes of the massacre, a boy dangling from a school window with 
one bloody arm hanging useless, his other arm flailing for help. 
</P>
<P>
	SWAT members eventually rushed to his rescue as he dropped from  
the second-floor library window Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He was identified today as 17-year-old Patrick Ireland.  
</P>
<P>
	As the video clip begins, the weight of the youth's body leans  
against broken glass, and his blood-soaked shirt displays the 
violence he was trying desperately to escape. 
</P>
<P>
	His plight grabbed the attention of the Lakewood SWAT team as  
they searched for explosives at Columbine High School. Within 
seconds, their armored truck was on the move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I turned to the driver and said, `Let's go get him.' We drove  
over the curb, over a couple of planters. We almost drove over a 
bicycle rack,'' said Sgt. George Hinkle. 
</P>
<P>
	With the truck in place under the shattered window, Sgt. John  
Romaniec and senior agent Donn Kraemer climbed on the roof and 
reached for Ireland's outstretched hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Using his remaining strength, the boy kicked up his legs and  
escaped from the library, which 90 minutes earlier had been ravaged 
by two teen-agers who laughed as they gunned down a teacher and 12 
of their unsuspecting classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Romaniec and Kraemer were able to grasp the boy's hands as he  
lunged out the window and slammed into the side of the armored 
truck. Shot twice in the head, his body bloodied and his awareness 
fading, Ireland was finally safe from the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was slipping in and out of consciousness,'' Romaniec said  
Thursday. ``Once we got him into the back of the van I had another 
officer ask him his name and talk to him. You could see the life 
was slipping away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland was taken to St. Anthony Hospital Central, where he  
remained in serious condition today and in intensive care with 
gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that this young man deserves all the credit,''  
Romaniec said. ``He is a survivor in the true meaning of the word 
survive. He was determined to get out of there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the only bright spot that we had in the whole day, and  
even that wasn't a bright spot,'' Hinkle said.

<HEADLINE> Four Groups Claim London Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Four extreme right-wing groups have claimed  
responsibility for a London bombing last week that injured 39 
people, and police said today they were investigating whether the 
bomber intended to hit a different target. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking at the possibility that it was white racist  
thugs who committed this brutal crime,'' said police Detective 
Chief Superintendent John Bunn. 
</P>
<P>
	The nail bomb explosion in a Brixton marketplace last Saturday  
had no obvious target in the ethnically mixed, south London 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	An anonymous caller claiming to be from the neo-Nazi group  
Combat 18 told police on Monday that his organization planted the 
bomb. Police said they were taking the call seriously but the claim 
could have been a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
	The call was made from Well Hall Road, where a black teen-ager  
was slain in 1993. A February report into the bungled police 
investigation of the killing said London's Metropolitan police 
force was riddled with racism. None of the five white suspects in 
the killing has been successfully prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	Scotland Yard said Friday that three more extreme right-wing  
racist groups have claimed responsibility. Police would not 
identify the groups, but said the attack was most likely the work 
of racists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Giving their names will probably fuel their egos and their  
twisted minds,'' Bunn said. ``These groups are very small. It's 
impossible to say whether (the claims) are real or hoaxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives said the bomber may have been on a bus that broke  
down at the market. In that case, he might have intended to set the 
explosives elsewhere in the capital. Police planned a re-enactment 
of the incident on Saturday to try to jog the memories of 
witnesses.

<HEADLINE>  Hyundai To Pare Number of Divisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Hyundai Group, Korea's biggest  
conglomerate, plans to reduce the number of its subsidiaries 
drastically over the next four years and eventually plans to divide 
itself into five key businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has been encouraging the nation's biggest  
companies to focus on key businesses and shed peripheral operations 
to become more efficient and regain foreign investors' confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai said Friday it would reduce the number of its  
subsidiaries to 26 from 79 by 2003 through sales and mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai officials said the conglomerate will eventually be  
broken into five groups to handle each of the core businesses -- 
automobiles, shipbuilding, construction-engineering, electronics 
and finance. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo, the nation's second largest conglomerate, unveiled plans  
earlier this week to sell its shipbuilding and 25 other 
subsidiaries by October to improve its financial position and focus 
on carmaking and finance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The restructuring will completely change the face of  
Hyundai,'' Park Se-yong, head of the group's corporate 
restructuring committee, told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Also announced at the news conference was the conclusion of a  
deal that allows Hyundai to buy a computer memory chip-making arm 
of LG group for $2.13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, wrapped up late Thursday after months of negotiations,  
calls for Hyundai to pay LG Semicon $1.3 billion immediately and 
the remainder in five installments by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition will make Hyundai Electronics Co. the world's  
largest memory chip producer with an estimated 20.8 percent share 
of the world market. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Hyundai To Pare Number of Divisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Hyundai Group, Korea's biggest  
conglomerate, plans to reduce the number of its subsidiaries 
drastically over the next four years and eventually plans to divide 
itself into five key businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has been encouraging the nation's biggest  
companies to focus on key businesses and shed peripheral operations 
to become more efficient and regain foreign investors' confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai said Friday it would reduce the number of its  
subsidiaries to 26 from 79 by 2003 through sales and mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai officials said the conglomerate will eventually be  
broken into five groups to handle each of the core businesses -- 
automobiles, shipbuilding, construction-engineering, electronics 
and finance. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo, the nation's second largest conglomerate, unveiled plans  
earlier this week to sell its shipbuilding and 25 other 
subsidiaries by October to improve its financial position and focus 
on carmaking and finance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The restructuring will completely change the face of  
Hyundai,'' Park Se-yong, head of the group's corporate 
restructuring committee, told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Also announced at the news conference was the conclusion of a  
deal that allows Hyundai to buy a computer memory chip-making arm 
of LG group for $2.13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, wrapped up late Thursday after months of negotiations,  
calls for Hyundai to pay LG Semicon $1.3 billion immediately and 
the remainder in five installments by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition will make Hyundai Electronics Co. the world's  
largest memory chip producer with an estimated 20.8 percent share 
of the world market. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai officials said the restructuring aims to reduce their  
group's total debt to $2.7 billion from $6.5 billion by the end of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of Hyundai subsidiaries to be sold, spun off or merged  
includes several profitable steel making, petrochemical and

<HEADLINE> U.S. Criticism of China Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- China blocked a U.S. attempt to censure its human  
rights record today, but Cuba, Iran and Iraq were among nations 
criticized by the 53-nation U.N. Human Rights Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. attempt to bring U.N. criticism against China suffered  
the same fate as similar motions had for seven straight years since 
1991. The commission voted 22-17 in favor of a Chinese proposal to 
take no action on the U.S. motion. Fourteen countries abstained. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States last year suspended its annual effort to  
criticize China in favor of a policy of diplomacy and dialogue. 
Washington put forward a motion this year following a sharp 
clampdown on dissent by Communist Party leaders in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	The motion, which welcomed China's efforts to develop its  
economy, expressed concern at ``continuing reports of violations of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms in China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also deplored ``increased restrictions on the exercise of  
cultural, religious and other freedoms of Tibetans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Hongju Koh, assistant secretary of state, said the United  
States was ``deeply disappointed'' at the outcome, saying 
Washington had ``sponsored the resolution as part of our 
principled, purposeful policy of engagement with China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese delegation charged that the United States pushed its  
motion purely out of domestic political concerns, and accused it of 
trying to derail reform in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba claimed a ``moral victory'' after a close commission vote  
of 21-20, with 12 abstentions, to criticize its record. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the commission rejected a U.S. motion against Cuba  
for the first time since 1991. This year, the United States took a 
back seat, and the resolution was put forward by the Czech Republic 
and Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba has faced criticism over recent moves to punish dissidents  
the government says back the U.S. embargo and other anti-Cuba 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	In other voting, Iraq was condemned for ``all-pervasive  
repression and oppression sustained by broad-based discrimination 
and widespread terror.'' No country supported Iraq, although 18 
nations abstained. 
</P>
<P>
	Myanmar, also known as Burma, was condemned for a long list of  
rights abuses, and Afghanistan and Sudan also were censured. 
Procedural wrangling delayed action on Congo. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran was held under special scrutiny and was censured 23-16,  
with commission members expressing particular concern over the 
country's high number of executions. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission voted for the second time in two weeks to condemn  
Serb repression in Kosovo. Russia was the only nation to oppose the 
motion, which deplored ``grave, horrendous and ongoing war 
crimes.'' An earlier Russian move to condemn rights violations 
throughout Yugoslavia, aimed at NATO airstrikes, was voted down. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria was rewarded for its transition to civilian rule after  
years of military dictatorship, which will be completed next month. 
The commission agreed to drop the West African nation from its 
agenda.

<HEADLINE>  Officer's Report Praised Teen Gunmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Less than three months before their  
carefully planned attack on Columbine High schoolmates, Dylan 
Klebold and Eric Harris were impressing a juvenile-court officer as 
bright young men with ``a great deal of potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't the only one fooled: Neighbors and friends say they  
were reassured by the teens' middle-class backgrounds and quiet, 
``utterly normal'' family lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold, 17, and Harris, 18, were caught breaking into a van  
last year and entered a juvenile-court diversion program allowing 
them to clear their records. They finished the program in February, 
with flying colors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eric is a very bright young man who is likely to succeed in  
life. He is intelligent enough to achieve lofty goals as long as he 
stays on task and remains motivated,'' a diversion officer wrote in 
Jefferson County District Court documents released Thursday. The 
officer's name was blacked out by the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Klebold, the officer wrote: ``Dylan has earned the right for  
an early termination. ... He is intelligent enough to make any 
dream a reality but he needs to understand hard work is part of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each teen completed 45 hours of community service, received  
counseling and wrote an apology letter. Harris received additional 
counseling in anger management, which he enjoyed, the officer 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys came in and put their best face on,'' said District  
Attorney Dave Thomas, the diversion officer's boss. ``Most of us in 
the system wish we were human lie-detectors, but we're not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said the officer was so upset that he was worried for  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's anguishing over what happened here,'' Thomas said today.  
``He's a very dedicated, committed public servant. ... He did the 
best he could do, I believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teens' middle-class upbringing also lulled adults into  
complacency -- even as some classmates grew alarmed at their bitter, 
vengeful tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
	At school, Klebold and Harris openly admired Hitler, hurled  
insults at minorities and conducted a running feud with the 
school's athletes. In the presence of adults, however, they were 
polite and friendly. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold lived in a home worth nearly $400,000, a modernistic  
cedar-and-glass structure tucked between two huge stone formations 
on a rural road. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Thomas Klebold, 52, is a former geophysicist who now  
runs a mortgage management business from his home. His mother, 
Susan, 50, has worked for the Colorado community-college system for 
years, helping disabled students gain access to education. 
</P>
<P>
	His maternal great-grandfather, the late Leo Yassenoff, was a  
prominent developer and philanthropist in Columbus, Ohio, a cousin 
said today. The Jewish Community Center of Columbus was named for 
him, and Susan Klebold had a Jewish upbringing, Skip Yassenoff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all scratching our heads right now,'' said Michael  
Briand, who knows Susan Klebold from his work as a 
community-development consultant at Arapahoe Community College. 
</P>
<P>
	Briand said Thomas Klebold is known as a liberal who favors gun  
control. Susan Klebold is a sensitive listener. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I can tell, this family was utterly, utterly  
normal,'' Briand said. ``They did everything right. But somehow the 
pain and anger was too deep, and they didn't see it or couldn't 
reach it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris moved to Littleton in 1996 from Plattsburgh, N.Y., where  
his father, Wayne Harris, was an Air Force pilot. In Littleton, the 
family bought a two-story, $184,000 home on a quiet cul-de-sac. 
Wayne Harris got a job at a flight-safety business, and his wife, 
Katherine, went to work for a catering company, according to the 
juvenile-court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors say Wayne and Katherine were quiet, sometimes waving  
across the fence while in the yard but making little effort to 
socialize. Eric's older brother, Kevin, played basketball with 
neighbors on trips home from college. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were pretty nice people, pretty quiet. They seemed to get  
along with everyone,'' said Matt Good, 16, who lives two doors 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Former neighbors in Plattsburgh remember the Harrises as a  
solid, middle-class family with a likable young son. They were 
shocked to learn that Eric Harris had shot up a school. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mouth just dropped,'' former classmate Kyle Ross said. ``He  
was a typical kid. He didn't seem anything like what is portrayed 
on TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The families were avoiding reporters, but both issued statements  
expressing sympathy for the victims, and Klebold's family wondered 
what went wrong: ``Like the rest of the country, we are struggling 
to understand why this happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Briand said Klebold's parents grew hopeful in recent months that  
their son was starting to lose his fascination with the black 
clothes and rebellious ways of ``Goth'' culture. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are also signs that Klebold's father suspected his son  
was still a threat to himself and others. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, amid TV reports of gunmen in trench coats rampaging  
through Columbine High, the elder Klebold contacted authorities, 
suspecting his son was involved and offering his help as a 
mediator. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said he was too late.

<HEADLINE> Moyer Signs $15M Deal With Seatlle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners signed  
left-hander Jamie Moyer to a $15 million, two-year contract 
extension Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which begins next season, includes a club option for  
the 2002 season. Moyer will get a $1 million signing bonus, $5.5 
million in 2000 and $6 million in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners must decide by the end of this season whether to  
exercise the $6.5 million option for 2002 or pay Moyer a $2.5 
million buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	Since joining the Mariners on July 30, 1996, Moyer has posted a  
39-18 record in 79 starts. Moyer has gone 105-95 in during his 
11-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``His record speaks for itself,'' Seattle vice president of  
baseball operations Woody Woodward said. ``His consistency, 
reliability, work ethic and willingness to help out teammates and 
work in the community make him an even more valuable member of the 
Mariners organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moyer is 1-2 with a 7.96 ERA in four starts this season.

<HEADLINE> Students Talk of Violence on MTV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Blaming the Colorado school massacre on gory  
video games and shock-rock music diverts attention from the anger 
and loneliness that may have pushed the teen-age gunmen over the 
edge, students say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like violence. I don't even like violent video games,  
but what caused those kids in Colorado to start shooting was that 
everyone was picking on them,'' said Tim Gooding, 13, who was 
wearing a T-shirt painted with bloody bullet holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooding was among about 100 students attending Thursday night's  
screening of ``Warning Signs,'' a 30-minute documentary about 
school violence produced by MTV. 
</P>
<P>
	He blamed school violence on parents and teachers who are  
``unable to stop kids from making fun of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MTV scheduled the screening of ``Warning Signs'' at Paramount  
Studios before Tuesday's shooting in Littleton, Colo., where two 
outcast high school students killed 12 students and one teacher 
before taking their own lives. Classmates described the gunmen as 
macabre ``Goths'' who played violent video games for hours and 
listened to Marilyn Manson. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussion at a forum held in conjunction with the screening  
focused mainly on the mistrust many of the youths feel for their 
parents, teachers and other authority figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a problem and the teachers are worried about whether  
I have my shirt tucked in,'' one student said to the crowd. ``How 
am I supposed to go to people like that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Student Marcus Lawrence said authorities also can overreact to  
troubled students. He told the crowd that many kids want to fight 
bullies out of anger but have no intention of committing serious 
harm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could think in my mind that I would kill them, but the sheer  
notion of somebody else in pain just bothers me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Psychologist Russ Newman, who sat on the forum panel, said  
parents and teachers often fail to take children's problems 
seriously, and instead blame violent behavior on media influences. 
</P>
<P>
	``Violence is a learned behavior,'' he said. ``Music and video  
games may also be part of it, but there are many factors involved 
in these incidents.''

<HEADLINE> Tennessee State Track Coach Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee State, facing a June hearing  
on eight major NCAA rules violations, fired track coach Stanford 
Strong for running two redshirt athletes under fake names. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we found out what happened we took immediate and  
corrective action,'' said Teresa Lawrence Phillips, the school's 
interim athletic director. ``Right now we are reassessing the 
entire track program to see where we stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant coach Ralph Thompson is filling in for Strong with the  
men. Women's coach Chandra Cheeseborough, a former Tennessee State 
Olympian, will oversee both track programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The firing Thursday is the latest in a string of problems for  
the school, which has produced such Olympic track stars as Ralph 
Boston and the late Wilma Rudolph. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Vivian Fuller was dismissed Dec. 30 for a  
variety of reasons, including a lack of organizational skills, 
following 15 months on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee State also has until May 10 to respond to accusations  
of rules violations. Six of those rules involve the football 
program. The school has a hearing June 4 in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The redshirt athletes took part in the Alabama Relays on March  
27 in Tuscaloosa. As redshirts, they were allowed to practice but 
were supposed to be held out of competition for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Using redshirted athletes in competition is not against NCAA  
rules -- they merely lose their redshirt status. However, running 
the athletes under assumed names breaches NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The university immediately declared the athletes ineligible and  
successfully petitioned the NCAA to reinstate their eligibility, 
Phillips said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Resolves To Continue Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Western leaders opened a celebration of NATO's  
50th anniversary today with a pledge to press on in the alliance's 
month-old fight against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
``NATO will not allow his campaign of terror to succeed,'' a draft 
statement declared. 
</P>
<P>
	As 19 NATO leaders debated the Kosovo crisis, Western leaders  
rejected a diplomatic overture from Milosevic to end the bombing, 
NATO's first-ever military offensive against a sovereign nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The overture did not meet two key demands -- removal of  
Milosevic's forces from the Serbian province and emplacement of an 
armed international peacekeeping force, leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic must know there is no place for his policies in  
Europe on the eve of the 21st century,'' NATO Secretary-General 
Javier Solana said in opening the summit's first session, one 
devoted exclusively to the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance was expected to issue a statement later today  
repeating demands that Milosevic end the violent campaign against 
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, remove his troops and accept an 
international peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hold President Milosevic responsible for the safety of all  
Kosovar citizens,'' said a draft of the statement. ``NATO is 
determined to prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, President Clinton told NATO allies, ``When we fight, we  
fight to prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We send a clear message of unity and determination to sustain  
our air campaign for as long as it takes,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting under extraordinary security, with several blocks  
surrounding the ornate Reagan Building sealed off and helicopters 
hovering overhead, NATO leaders were also expected to consider 
whether to deploy ground troops to Kosovo -- a move not supported by 
all members. 
</P>
<P>
	No final decision was expected.  
</P>
<P>
	After their public remarks, the leaders were briefed behind  
closed doors by NATO's top military leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme commander for Europe, told the  
gathering: ``We are winning. He (Milosevic) is losing. And he knows 
it,'' according to a U.S. official who was in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft statement also calls for intensified strikes and  
stronger economic sanctions and expresses NATO's readiness to stop 
the bombing after clear acceptance by Belgrade of NATO's 
conditions, said officials familiar with the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement declares that NATO won't accept any threat against  
neighboring countries and expresses support for the government of 
Montenegro, Yugoslavia's smaller, pro-Western republic, saying any 
attempt to undermine that government would have grave consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	It also expresses a desire to work with the Russians.  
</P>
<P>
	A senior U.S. official said that, while the allies were unified  
on the military aspects of the statement, there were divergent 
views on a U.S. call for blocking seaborne shipments of oil to 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic's summit-eve offer to allow an international force in  
Kosovo, relayed through a Russian mediator, was roundly rejected as 
inadequate by the alliance. French President Jacques Chirac called 
it ``totally insufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not saying that it is unuseful, but it does not  
correspond to the demands of the international community as they 
have been expressed by the NATO secretary-general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mediator, Russian diplomat Viktor Chernomyrdin, suggested  
today that Milosevic might agree to an armed force in Kosovo under 
certain circumstances. At the Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth Bacon 
said: ``The fact that he's prepared to allow foreign troops in does 
not say nearly enough. He has to be prepared to take his troops out 
and stop the killing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO spokesman Jamie Shea dismissed the latest version of  
Milosevic's offer. ``It seems to fall well short of what we are 
looking for,'' he said. ``The next time he gets in touch, it has to 
be a much more substantial offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the air campaign against Yugoslavia, now in its fifth  
week, continued. The headquarters of Belgrade's main television 
network was hit, and NATO destroyed one of Milosevic's homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that damage continues,'' British Prime  
Minister Tony Blair said this morning on NBC. However, Blair 
sounded some guarded optimism about Milosevic's gesture. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it is an indication that Milosevic now realizes that we  
will carry on until those demands are met, then to that extent it 
is something we should note,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana welcomed NATO's newest members, former Warsaw Pact  
nations Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, and said the 
alliance ``could not remain indifferent'' to Milosevic's tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials were pushing alliance members for a blockade or  
embargo on oil going into Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton bestowed his support on Solana's decision to have NATO  
military leaders update contingency plans for Yugoslavia, including 
one for a possible ground assault. The president called it ``a wise 
and prudent course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Clinton and other Western leaders continued to stress  
they believed the conflict could be ended with an intensifying air 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bombing is working, but we need to intensify it and carry  
it on,'' Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all NATO leaders were comfortable with the progress of the  
air war. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said prolonged bombing of  
Yugoslavia could turn his nation against NATO and the United 
States. While sticking to Greece's official support, Simitis said: 
``The more the war continues, the more difficult the problems will 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders planned an early afternoon gathering to celebrate  
the April 4, 1949, signing of the treaty that established the Cold 
War alliance to confront the Soviet Union in Europe. It was to be 
followed by a reception at the Capitol and a White House dinner. 
The summit concludes Sunday.

<HEADLINE> NATO Born in Tense, Fearful Climate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If matters in Europe are unsettling now,  
consider the world of 1948-49. Communists seized Czechoslovakia in 
a coup, seemed poised to win power in Italy and blockaded Berlin. 
Out of this chaos NATO was born, in a 15-page document bound in 
blue goatskin. 
</P>
<P>
	World War II ended with a reed of hope the Soviet Union and the  
West could get along. The reed soon shattered in the emerging Cold 
War as the Soviet ``sphere of influence'' spread and Russians came 
to see America as an imperialist threat. 
</P>
<P>
	In the months leading to NATO's formation 50 years ago, Norway,  
Greece and Turkey were in danger of spinning into the Soviet orbit, 
as much of Eastern Europe had already done. 
</P>
<P>
	Communists in France and Italy urged workers to give aid and  
comfort to the Red Army if it should see fit to move in. 
</P>
<P>
	In forgotten moments that then loomed large, communist Romania  
passed the death penalty for crimes against ``economic progress'' 
and Moscow announced it would write a 50-volume encyclopedia with 
its own version of the truth that would ``reflect the party line -- 
all the facts ... precise and correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Soviets demonstrated their hostility by blocking 2 million  
pounds of American mail bringing Christmas greetings to Poles and 
Germans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stratagem of the aggressor is to keep his intended victim  
divided,'' said Dean Acheson, then secretary of state. ``Then they 
can be picked off one by one. We and the free nations of Europe are 
determined that history shall not repeat itself in that melancholy 
particular.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so unity was chosen, and affirmed April 4, 1949, on an  
ornate stage decorated with pink and lavender hydrangeas backed by 
palm fronds. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are about to do here is a neighborly act,'' President  
Truman said at the signing ceremony. ``For us war is not 
inevitable. We do not believe that there are blind tides of history 
which sweep men one way or the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People and nations, however, were rapidly lining up on one side  
or the other. Geoffrey Fisher, archbishop of Canterbury, clumsily 
summed up the polarization by saying humanity only had three 
categories -- Christians, communists and ``amiable nonentities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO pledged the United States and Canada to the defense of  
Europe. For America, it marked ``as sharp a break with isolationism 
as any diplomat could imagine,'' historian Lawrence S. Kaplan 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't an easy decision for some other countries, either.  
</P>
<P>
	The Italians voted to join after 49 hours of debate marked by  
fistfights. ``You buffoon!'' Italian Communist leader Palmiro 
Togliatti cried at Premier Alcide de Gasperi. ``You infamous one!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Icelandic Parliament voted 37-13 to be part of NATO, as  
communists outside hurled stones through the windows. 
</P>
<P>
	John Foster Dulles, then a foreign policy adviser to Republicans  
and a future secretary of state, questioned whether Washington was 
going out of its way to rile Moscow by admitting some of its 
Scandinavian neighbors. ``The U.S. should not seek military bases 
so close to the Soviet Union as to carry an offensive threat that 
is disproportionate to defensive value,'' he said, in vain. 
</P>
<P>
	In forming their military alliance, NATO leaders were worried  
not only about a Soviet invasion but about communism's native 
appeal in nations gripped by poverty and hunger. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Truman Doctrine, pledging to help free people resist  
communism, Washington poured $400 million of aid into Greece, to 
help overcome a communist uprising, and into Turkey, facing a 
similar threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington also feared that Italy would choose communism freely.  
Instead, Italians elected a centrist government. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of a one-for-all, all-for-one common defense worked.  
Until the Balkan bloodshed began, NATO never had to resort to arms.

<HEADLINE> Kemp's Injury Worries Cavaliers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Shawn Kemp's sprained foot is a big concern for  
the Cleveland Cavaliers in their bid to reach the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The team hoped to find out today the condition of Kemp's foot  
after he was evaluated Thursday night at the Cleveland Clinic. Kemp 
sprained his left foot in Wednesday's 93-80 loss at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays taken Wednesday showed there is no fracture, but Kemp was  
put in a splint and will not travel with the Cavaliers to tonight's 
game against Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing their team leader any time is difficult, but if Kemp was  
to miss the Cavs' last eight games, Cleveland's chances of beating 
out Charlotte, New York and Toronto for the final playoff spot in 
the Eastern Conference would seem slim. 
</P>
<P>
	Kemp, Cleveland's leading scorer with 20.5 points per game, has  
already been playing hurt, carrying a team that lost center 
Zydrunas Ilgauskas early in the season to a broken foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Kemp needed eight stitches over his left eye to close a gash he  
sustained in an April 4 game against Milwaukee. He's also been 
hampered by baseball-sized swelling in his right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	His latest injury happened in the third quarter of the Miami  
game after Kemp made a steal from Tim Hardaway. Kemp tried to 
continue, but Brevin Knight saw he was in pain and fouled Hardaway 
to get Kemp out of the game.

<HEADLINE> School Slave Posters Halted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Elementary school officials have put a  
stop to a teaching project in which fifth-grade students were told 
to draw wanted posters of black slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers said the project was meant to heighten sensitivity.  
Minorities called it offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunrise Elementary School students were told to make the slave  
appear beaten and bloodied. One student in an all-white class 
refused to draw the slave and the teacher said the student could 
draw a white slave, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we found out about it on an administrative level we  
immediately said this is not the approach we're going to take,'' 
principal Norman Emerson said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said administrators learned of the poster April 14, and all  
were taken down within a half hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Emerson said the teacher intended to show students how brutal  
runaway slaves were treated and by discussing the practice show 
that ``this was a very inhumane thing to do.'' The teacher was not 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Emerson said the project will no longer be used and teachers  
will undergo sensitivity training.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Court-Document Excerpts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Columbine High School gunmen Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris  
entered a juvenile-court diversion program after they were caught 
breaking into a van last year. They finished the program in 
February, impressing their diversion officer with their prospects 
for a bright future. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer's name was blocked out of documents released  
Thursday by the Jefferson County District Court. Here are some 
excerpts from his final reports on each teen: 
</P>
<P>
                         	 *DYLAN KLEBOLD   	
</P>
<P>
	``Dylan's attitude while on Diversion was solid and he remained  
motivated even when I added the Adult Legal issues Packet to the 
contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``45 hours of CSW (community service work) were completed at  
various locations in the community and Dylan felt like this was the 
most effective piece of Diversion. He learned a lot from having to 
give up free time to work for no money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Dylan had a tendency to struggle with motivation around school  
work so we focused on this area for some time. He was able to 
maintain a good grade point average after some confrontation and is 
set to graduate in the Spring 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``PROGNOSIS: Good. Dylan is a bright young man who has a great  
deal of potential. If he is able to tap his potential and become 
self-motivated he should do well in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``RECOMMENDATIONS: Successful Termination. Dylan has earned the  
right for an early termination. He needs to strive to self-motivate 
himself so he can remain on a positive path. He is intelligent 
enough to make any dream a reality, but he needs to understand hard 
work is part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                          	 *ERIC HARRIS   	
</P>
<P>
	``Eric did a very nice job on Diversion. He remained focused on  
Diversion despite completing a few classes that he felt had no 
impact, such as the MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) Panel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He did enjoy completing the Anger Management (classes) which  
seemed to fit nicely with the individual counseling he was involved 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Eric excelled in school and never had any problems in this  
area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Eric completed the Adult Legal Issues Packet very quickly and  
stated that he thought that piece was interesting because he 
discovered things he did not know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``PROGNOSIS: Good. Eric is a very bright young man who is likely  
to succeed in life. He is intelligent enough to achieve lofty goals 
as long as he stays on task and remains motivated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``RECOMMENDATIONS: Successful Termination. Eric should seek out  
more education at higher levels. He impressed me as being very 
articulate and intelligent. These are skills that he should grow 
and use as frequently as possible.''

<HEADLINE> Colo. Gov. Describes School Scene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Gov. Bill Owens' voice broke, he stammered and  
swallowed hard as he described Friday what he saw in a tour of the 
aftermath of the massacre inside Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a scene of devastation. I went into the library and I  
never want to see a room like that again in my life. The 
destruction and damage throughout the area of the school where this 
occurred was ... stunning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens was shaken by small reminders of what children were doing  
before two boys walked in with guns and explosives, turning a 
regular school day into hell. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was most troubling, there'd be a table of four kids,  
books would be open, the pen would be down, and you could see where 
(one) stopped a sentence. It was an application for the University 
of Colorado at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``She also had `Do life story,' and I guess one of her teachers  
had asked for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens spoke of teacher William ``Dave'' Sanders, who died as  
students tried to stem the blood draining from his body. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a hero he was. He was shot in the main hall of the school  
after he had gone downstairs to alert the cafeteria with others, to 
get out. 
</P>
<P>
	``They then bombed the cafeteria with a bomb so hot it melted  
the ceiling tiles. Had the kids been in there, perhaps 200 kids 
were in there at the time, how many would have died?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders ran back upstairs to an area where the Columbine seal is  
in the carpet, Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where he was shot.''  
</P>
<P>
	In the cafeteria there were knapsacks, milk and sandwiches all  
over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw anything like that and never want to,'' he said.  
``As time passes, and as numbers mount, we tend to depersonalize 
and become less sensitive. I'll never be able to depersonalize this 
tragedy, or be less sensitive.''

<HEADLINE>  Ripken Weighs Options </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken isn't quite sure just how serious  
his back injury is, admitting Friday that he might have to go 
beyond cortisone shots to alleviate the pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken never mentioned the word ``retirement'' in his first  
meeting with the media since going on the disabled list Monday. But 
he didn't dismiss that option, either. 
</P>
<P>
	His plan appeared to be to work toward returning to action,  
although he remains unsure as to the best means of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here today to say I'm going to be OK. It's no big issue in  
my whole life,'' he said. ``I have to look hard at my injury 
situation, evaluate that with my whole career, and make decisions 
and judgments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a situation that merits serious consideration. I'm  
weighing a lot of things,'' he added. ``I'm still gathering 
information, so I can't say what it is I'm trying to decide. I'm 
trying to determine what are the options, the possible courses to 
take, and really confirming what the condition is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, 38, played in a major league record 2,632 straight games  
before willingly ending his streak last September. He had never 
before been placed on the disabled list before this week, but 
fought through a herniated disk in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Surgery was never ever suggested then,'' he said. ``Since that  
point, until the day before Opening Day, I haven't had an ounce of 
back pain. So this is not a chronic thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The short-term solution is to receive cortisone shots in his  
lower back. Whether that will provide lasting relief is not known. 
</P>
<P>
	``The easy option was to get a shot that would relieve some of  
the inflammation. That was a no-brainer,'' he said. ``This is a 
situation where I don't have control, I can't go out and will 
myself to do it. It's a situation that needs to be fixed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watching his teammates play has been a unique experience, one he  
has not enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's another issue I'll have to come to grips with. I've  
always been someone to come to the ballpark and want to play,'' he 
said. ``There's a certain sad feeling (when) you're not playing.''

<HEADLINE> Army Releases Names of Crash Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) -- Officials on Friday released the names  
of the seven soldiers killed when their helicopter crashed during a 
training mission in a remote, wooded area of Fort Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	All 11 soldiers on the Black Hawk helicopter belonged to the  
101st Aviation Regiment, including seven soldiers from the 6th 
Battalion and the four-member flight crew from the 5th Battalion. 
</P>
<P>
	Killed in Thursday's crash were: Spec. Anthony W. Brown, 29;  
Pfc. Earl C. Eoff, 29; Sgt. Robert G. Millward, 32; Spec. James R. 
Murphy Jr., 25; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Aaron K. Power, 30; Spec. 
Fury J. Rice, 21; Sgt. Julius R. Wilkes Jr., 23. Hometowns were not 
provided. 
</P>
<P>
	The surviving four soldiers remained hospitalized Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	There are no immediate plans to ground any Black Hawks, pending  
the outcome of an investigation, said Lt. Col. Guy Shields, an Army 
spokesman at the Pentagon. ``They're our safest helicopters,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers were practicing getting on or off the helicopter,  
probably from a fairly low height. There was no explosion or fire, 
but the helicopter broke apart upon impact, said George Heath, a 
Fort Campbell spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The base is headquarters for the 101st Airborne Division, the  
Army's only air assault division. It straddles the 
Kentucky-Tennessee line about 200 miles southwest of Louisville.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Decries GOP Inaction on SS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he was ``deeply  
disappointed'' by indications Republican leaders may have abandoned 
the idea of fundamentally changing Social Security before the 2000 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just one week after passing a budget that promises a massive  
$800 billion tax cut, the Republican leadership is sending a 
message that Congress is either unable or unwilling to face up to 
the challenge of strengthening Social Security,'' Clinton said in a 
statement. ``That is not acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert denied that the GOP  
leadership has given up on moving Social Security legislation this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The speaker remains committed to encouraging as many ideas as  
possible to come to the fore regarding the strengthening of Social 
Security,'' said Hastert spokesman Pete Jeffries. ``We have to get 
as many ideas out there as possible so that we see if we can 
develop a bipartisan consensus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some influential Republican lawmakers are close to unveiling  
plans to overhaul Social Security and had been reaching out to 
moderate Democrats to forge alliances in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	However, GOP leaders have so far not come forward or signaled  
that they intend to endorse any of the plans, although the 
leadership has been kept apprised of the ongoing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Republican House members say they have been told by  
their party's leaders that trying to overhaul Social Security this 
year, with the 2000 presidential election looming, would be too 
politically risky, according to a report in today's New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said the Republican leadership was citing GOP polls  
indicating that among Americans who feel strongly about Social 
Security, more were skeptical than receptive about Republican 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in his statement today, said: ``I am deeply  
disappointed by reports that the congressional Republican 
leadership has abandoned the effort to enact legislation this year 
to strengthen Social Security for the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remain committed to working with members of Congress of both  
parties who are committed to enacting comprehensive Social Security 
legislation this year,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Republican lawmakers working on Social Security overhaul  
plans is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. 
Bill Archer, R-Texas, and Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla. They want to use 
expected government surpluses to fund a new system of personal 
retirement accounts American workers could invest in the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Those familiar with the Archer-Shaw plan say that the investment  
earnings would be substituted, on an individual basis, for 
traditional Social Security benefits, likely at something close to 
a dollar-for-dollar exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republican Sens. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and Rick  
Santorum of Pennsylvania are collaborating with moderate Democrats 
including Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., on a plan combining similar 
personal accounts with upfront trimming of Social Security 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Both groups say they plan to go ahead and introduce their ideas.  
</P>
<P>
	Many Republican lawmakers, however, are accusing Democrats of  
holding up movement on Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``With an issue of this scope, the likelihood of moving Social  
Security reform or modernization is not going to take place without 
the president taking ... a lead,'' Sen. Connie Mack of Florida, who 
chairs the Senate Republican Conference., said in an interview 
earlier this week. ``Frankly, we think he ducked it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Democrats blocked an attempt by Republicans to get  
a vote on the Senate floor on a measure that would make it more 
difficult for lawmakers to spend surpluses that come from Social 
Security taxes, rather than income taxes, on anything but shoring 
up the retirement program or paying off the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has his own plan for the Social Security surpluses,  
introduced in his State of the Union speech earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	He would also use the surpluses to pay down the national debt,  
but wants to try to give Social Security a tangible claim on the 
economic growth that would be expected to result: IOUs that would 
assure the program income-tax dollars after baby boomers retire. 
Clinton also has called for government investment of some of Social 
Security's cash reserves in the stock market.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Cos. Plan New Marketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The smoke in bars may get thicker now that  
tobacco companies have had to remove their billboard advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco companies that have been spending an estimated $150  
million a year on outdoor advertising are expected to boost 
spending on promotions in bars, sweepstakes, store displays and 
magazines, including those they invent. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are very agile,'' Ned Levine, who heads the marketing  
firm Firebrand LLC in Providence, R.I., said of the tobacco 
companies. ``There are plenty of ways for them to make 
impressions'' without billboards. 
</P>
<P>
	The major tobacco companies agreed to quit advertising on  
billboards as part of last fall's $206 billion settlement of 
lawsuits by 46 states seeking reimbursement for what they were 
spending on treating sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	The billboard ban took effect Friday and as part of the deal,  
states had a chance to use the billboards for messages discouraging 
smoking until the tobacco company leases on the space run out. 
</P>
<P>
	But marketing experts said the industry has prospered despite  
restrictions that saw cigarette ads vanish from TV and radio in the 
early 1970s and, more recently, drove smokers out of their offices 
and public spaces to puff by the curbsides. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies won't be specific about their plans, saying they  
don't want to tip off their rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are any number of responsible ways to effectively market  
our products to adults who choose to smoke,'' said Ellen Merlo, a 
spokeswoman for Philip Morris USA, the nation's biggest tobacco 
company and the maker of the top selling cigarette brand Marlboro. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the alternatives expected to draw increased support are  
bar programs in which tobacco companies help a bar owner pay to 
stage special events like live music, fashion shows, magic acts and 
photography exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, the sponsor gets exclusive advertising privileges  
in the bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Under its program, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. supplies the bars  
with napkins and matches with the Camel name, and has workers on 
hand ready to swap a pack of Camels for other brands, said Reynolds 
spokeswoman Carole Crosslin. Reynolds is the nation's second 
biggest tobacco company. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its bar program, Philip Morris encourage customers to  
sign up for its ``Marlboro Party at the Ranch'' sweepstakes under 
which 2,000 people have won five-day trips since last fall to one 
of three ranches the company owns in Montana and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., the third biggest U.S. tobacco  
company, spends about $30 million a year on its bar programs for 
its Kool and Lucky Strike brands, said spokesman Mark Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco companies like the programs because bars don't allow  
in minors, and means that the bar crowd is old enough to smoke 
legally. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco companies are also expected to spend more money in the  
stores where cigarettes are sold to put up signs and get better 
displays for their brands. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement's ban on billboards exempted signs smaller than  
14 square feet on stores that sell cigarettes as well as displays 
inside the stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Myers, a lawyer for the advocacy group Campaign for  
Tobacco-Free Kids, said that could lead to even more tobacco 
advertising on the sides of stores in inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
	And Bill Kline, a lawyer for the Tobacco Control Resource Center  
at Northeastern University, said he expects to see more cigarette 
signs at the counter -- where children will see them. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to entice them to think of smoking as the normal  
thing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco companies will also spend more to get preferred shelf  
space inside stores, said tobacco analyst David Adelman of Morgan 
Stanley Dean Witter. 
</P>
<P>
	Magazines could benefit from the billboard ban by getting more  
tobacco advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco advertisers spent $324.6 million on magazine  
advertisements in 1998, twice as much as the $152.9 million spent 
on outdoor advertising, according to Competitive Media Reporting, 
which tracks ad spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the three biggest tobacco companies already publish their  
own lifestyle magazines that are sent free to people in their 
databases. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris has been publishing the quarterly magazine  
``Unlimited'' for about two years. Merlo declined to say how many 
people get it. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown &AMP; Williamson launched the magazine ``Real Edge'' earlier  
this year. It is aimed mainly at men and was sent to 1 million 
smokers. The company is also testing a magazine for women called 
``Flair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real wise use of advertising dollars,'' said Smith.  
``We are reaching known smokers. We know they are adults. And we 
know they want to receive this information.''

<HEADLINE> Merck Sales Jump 24 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merck &AMP; Co. reported Friday its first-quarter  
profits rose 12 percent as sales for the nation's top drug maker 
rose 24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck attributed the big gains to the strength of several  
established heart drugs and its pharmacy benefits business, but 
said increased spending on research and marketing restricted its 
earnings growth somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strong results, Merck's stock slipped 2 percent as  
investors worried that sales of Merck's top-selling drug Zocor, an 
anti-cholesterol medication, were slowing. That places puts more 
pressure on Merck to ensure that its new painkiller Vioxx becomes a 
blockbuster. Vioxx is expected to get Food and Drug Administration 
approval in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vioxx is taking on added importance because Merck has lost a  
good chunk of its anti-cholesterol market,'' said Hemant Shah, 
analyst with HKS &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitehouse Station, N.J.-based Merck earned $1.3 billion in the  
first quarter, or 54 cents a share, compared to $1.16 billion or 47 
cents a share in the same quarter a year ago. Results matched Wall 
Street expectations, according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the first quarter rose to $7.5 billion from $6.06  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Merck fell $1 13/16 to $76 1/16 in afternoon trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Zocor, which leads the world in sales for cholesterol-lowering  
medication, is losing ground in the U.S. market, where it's No. 2 
behind Warner-Lamber's Lipitor. Zocor posted an 11 percent rise in 
sales to $975 million. Sales of Merck's other cholesterol drug, 
Mevacor, rose 11 percent to $195 million after several quarters of 
declining sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Zocor and Mevacor have been losing market share to Lipitor in  
the United States as doctors view Lipitor as the more potent drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck-Medco Managed Care, Merck's pharmacy benefits division,  
posted a 35 percent increase in sales to $3.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Cozaar/Hazaar, which treat hypertension, increased 35  
percent to $290 million. Fosamax, an osteoporosis drug, had a 28 
percent increase in sales to $230 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Singulair, Merck's once-a-day tablet to treat chronic asthma,  
had $90 million in sales, just a slight increase over the previous 
quarter. The drug was launched last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Propecia, the heavily marketed anti-baldness drug, had $45  
million in sales, compared to $30 million in the fourth quarter. 
The drug was launched in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepcid, an ulcer drug, continuing to lose market share to newer  
competitors, suffered a 19 percent decline in sales to $260 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck increased research spending in the quarter by 14 percent  
to $442 million. The company increased marketing spending by 16 
percent to $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the merger between Swedish drug maker Astra and  
Britains Zeneca Group, Astra will pay $1.8 billion to Merck in 
return for Merck giving up rights to future Astra products that do 
not have U.S. patents. The transaction will be reflected in 
second-quarter results, Merck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Astra has already paid Merck $1.7 billion and the two companies  
are disputing the final $100 million, Merck said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel  
gave preliminary approval to Merck's Vioxx to treat osteoarthritis 
and acute pain. Vioxx is part of a class of new drugs designed to 
be gentler on the stomach than older painkillers such as ibuprofen. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expected the drug to quickly reach annual sales of $1  
billion, though it will face a tough challenge from Monsanto's 
Celebrex, which has been on the market for four months.

<HEADLINE> Shootings Indicate Bigger Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four out of five Americans say the shootings  
at a Colorado high school are a sign that something is seriously 
wrong in this country, says a poll on the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll taken this week indicated 79 percent  
believe Tuesday's shootings in Littleton, Colo., that left 15 dead 
-- including the two assailants -- are a sign of serious national 
problems, not just isolated incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	People placed a ``great deal'' of the blame for the shootings on  
the ready availability of guns; followed by parents; TV programs, 
movies and music; and social pressures on youth. Media coverage of 
similar incidents, the Internet and schools got the least blame. 
</P>
<P>
	The steps identified in the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll as most  
effective in stopping high school violence were imposing stricter 
gun control on teen-agers, placing tougher regulation on TV and 
movie violence, putting metal detectors in schools, increasing 
counseling for teen-agers and restricting what's available to teens 
on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-fourths in a poll by Fox News/Opinion Dynamics said teens  
who kill teens should face the possibility of the death penalty and 
half said parents of teens who kill other teens should face some 
legal responsibility for their children's actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The CNN/USA Today/Gallup telephone poll of 659 adults was taken  
Wednesday and has an error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage 
points. The Fox News telephone poll of 942 adults taken Wednesday 
and Thursday has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points.

<HEADLINE> Arena Football Opening 13th Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Following its busiest offseason, a new partnership with the NFL  
and plans for more expansion, Arena Football enters its 13th season 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner David Baker, with a five-year contract extension  
and dozens of cities clamoring to join the indoor football league, 
is even taking calls from potential team owners and from commercial 
sponsors eager to sign on. 
</P>
<P>
	``First and foremost, some of the good stuff had to do with the  
NFL,'' Baker says. ``It is a significant alliance for us. It has a 
lot of promise in terms of it speaks to the credibility of our 
sport. It's an endorsement of our credibility by the NFL and it 
gets more people playing and watching football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to marketing agreements, the NFL can buy up to 49.9  
percent of the league and have a voice in its operation. Baker's 
counterpart with the NFL, Paul Tagliabue, doesn't take the 
association with the Arena League lightly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to support football at all levels,'' Tagliabue  
says. ``An interest in the 13-year-old Arena Football League would 
enhance our stake in the future of the game, both in the United 
States and internationally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AFL phones have been ringing a lot more since the NFL deal was  
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen heightened interest by sponsors,'' he says. ``But  
just as significantly, last year we had 23 of our guys play with 
NFL teams. We've had nine coaches and now have had 10 officials go 
from the AFL to the NFL. Our alliance with the NFL has not been 
about player development, but about the business of promoting 
football. One of benefits of it is some great athletes we are 
developing are getting a chance in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``To what extent the NFL involvement has helped in our expansion  
we're not sure, but the values of our teams clearly are up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, AFL teams that once went for $500,000 now have a price  
tag of close to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Arena Football, which has a TV contract with ABC and ESPN -- a  
weekly Monday night game will appear on ESPN2 and the ArenaBowl 
championship game will be shown on ABC -- added a franchise in 
Buffalo for this season. That brought membership to 15 teams, and 
the Destroyers, who open the season at home next Friday, already 
have a season-ticket base of 12,000. That's more than some NBA 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL also has three clubs in Florida (Fort Lauderdale,  
Orlando, Tampa Bay), and teams in Nashville; East Rutherford, N.J.; 
Albany, N.Y.; Hartford, Conn.; Phoenix; San Jose, Calif.; Portland, 
Ore.; Milwaukee; Houston; Grand Rapids, Mich.; and Des Moines, 
Iowa. Chicago and New Orleans are expected to join next year. 
</P>
<P>
	A minimum arena size of 12,500 seats has been set for teams  
entering the league, which doesn't help many of the smaller cities 
seeking to be part of by far the most successful indoor offshoot of 
a major outdoor sport. 
</P>
<P>
	So the AFL is developing a grass-roots league, arenafootball2,  
which will debut next year. The idea is simple: bring professional 
football in the spring and summer to areas that have only prep and 
college football in the fall and winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we move forward with expansion, we get so many calls from  
people who run arenas or who want to put a team in an arena with 
seating below 10,000,'' Baker says. ``A whole lot of people are 
calling with arenas of 5,000-6,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes that NFL owners will run future Arena League teams.  
Saints owner Tom Benson already is involved, and Cowboys owner 
Jerry Jones and Patriots owner Robert Kraft have expressed 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, several Southern cities, including Little Rock, Ark.,  
Mobile, Ala., and Biloxi, Miss., are seriously considering 
arenafootball2. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would be a great opportunity to bring football back to  
its highest levels of popularity,'' Baker says. ``NCAA Division I's 
size seems to reduce each year, but here is a chance to take 
football into some of those smaller towns and touch people 
directly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL also is talking with NFL Europe and the CFL about  
expanding internationally. Baker has gotten calls from people in 
Japan interested in an indoor league. 
</P>
<P>
	And here's perhaps the surest sign the AFL is becoming big time:  
an Arena Football video game and a film whose plot centers around 
the sport are being developed.

<HEADLINE>  Bomb Found in High School Kitchen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Eyeing a possibly broader conspiracy,  
investigators in the Columbine High School massacre said two 
teen-agers who gunned down a dozen classmates and a teacher may 
have been aided in their rampage by ``confederates'' who helped 
booby-trap the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's officials were due back on campus by dawn today to  
continue scouring for hidden explosives as students stayed away, 
frightened and mourning. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 15 people, including gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan  
Klebold, died in the Tuesday attack. Fourteen students remained 
hospitalized, including eight in critical or serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the discovery of a powerful bomb made from a  
20-pound propane tank heightened suspicions that Harris, 18, and 
Kleblod, 17, intended to destroy the school, and could have had 
help in assembling their arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may have had confederates,'' said sheriff's Sgt. Jim  
Parr. 
</P>
<P>
	Explosives expert Sid Woodcock said propane explosives of the  
type found are ``fairly sophisticated.'' Just one bomb ``probably 
would have destroyed a good part of the school,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These subjects were not only on a killing rampage,'' said  
Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone. ``They were going to burn the 
school up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the large bomb, searches have turned up more than 30  
homemade explosives, including pipe bombs, crude hand grenades. 
More may still remain hidden, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sawed-off shotguns, one 9mm semi-automatic rifle and one  
semi-automatic handgun also have been found. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have also recovered, but have not yet reviewed, a  
videotape from a school security system that covers the library 
where many of the victims were found, The Denver Post reported 
today, citing sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, documents said court-ordered evaluations of the  
suspects, compiled earlier this year, called Harris ``a bright 
young man who is likely to succeed in life'' and found Klebold had 
``a great deal of potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine will be closed indefinitely. Other schools in the  
district reopened Thursday to tight security. 
</P>
<P>
	At rival Chatfield High School, jittery staff and students  
walked past armed guards to enter as classes reconvened. At one 
point, two bomb squad trucks sped to the school after an unattended 
backpack was found. Students needed parental permission to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't even go to the bathroom without permission, and then  
they time you,'' lamented Holly Bernside, 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County school administrators began trying to return  
normalcy to Columbine students' lives by scouting for alternative 
class sites and planning events like graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The students are saying, `We want to be back together. We want  
to be in school. We want to be with our teachers,''' said 
Superintendent Jane Hammond. Hammond said students will return to 
the same school building next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jefferson County Court reports on Klebold and Harris,  
written less than three months ago, were compiled by an officer 
assessing their future after they were caught breaking into a van 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold and Harris, members of the disaffected, brooding  
``Trenchcoat Mafia'' at Columbine High, finished a juvenile court 
program successfully in February, clearing their records. The 
county district court released copies of the documents, but blacked 
out the officer's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were questioning classmates and others who knew  
the gunmen. Two fellow members of the Trenchcoat Mafia apologized 
to mourners on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no sign they would do this,'' sobbed Nicole Makham.  
``We would just like to say that we're sorry for what they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Columbine grounds Thursday, there was some hint of the  
crisis lifting. Teachers trickled in to retrieve their cars; an 
investigator rescued 30 baby chicks and a lizard from a science 
lab. 
</P>
<P>
	A mile away, Attorney General Janet Reno commiserated with  
relatives and community leaders as family members prepared for a 
weekend of memorials. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not something that is dealt with in a day or a week or  
a month,'' Reno said. ``This, as we have learned from Oklahoma City 
and other tragedies, is something that must be dealt with over 
time, and we are in this for the long haul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other shooting-related developments Thursday:  
</P>
<P>
	--Investigators confirmed they had found a note at one suspect's  
home but refused to discuss its contents. 
</P>
<P>
	--The sheriff's office said it planned to release tapes of some  
911 calls today. 
</P>
<P>
	--Classmates said Klebold and Harris made several class-project  
videos last fall foreshadowing their spasm of violence. In one, 
``they had their friends pretend to be the jocks, and they 
pretended to be the gunmen shooting them,'' high school junior 
Chris Reilly told the Denver Rocky Mountain News. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials said they hadn't yet determined whether such a  
video was made. 
</P>
<P>
	--Police defended their initial response to the school massacre.  
They insisted they were rescuing students within minutes of the 
first 911 call but had to move cautiously because of the danger of 
bombs and bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	--The FBI sent a subpoena to America Online, seeking information  
on Web sites and member profiles thought to belong to Harris or 
Klebold.

<HEADLINE> Sun, Wind Keys to Climate Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The world will have to use sources of  
energy such as the sun and wind to keep climate change in check in 
the new millennium, organizers said in announcing the theme for 
Earth Day 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy and climate change are the focus of a worldwide campaign  
to draw attention to energy needs ahead of next year's Earth Day, 
organizers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we look at the vast array of energy problems that are  
facing the world, most of them have to do with environmental 
constraints,'' said Dennis Hayes, the chairman of Earth Day 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Earth Day will occur in April 2000 but activities will continue  
throughout the year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the United States  
supported Earth Day's theme ``New Energy for a New Era.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us play a role in making Earth Day's ideals a  
reality,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the launch, Earth Day organizers presented six awards to  
individuals and businesses promoting good environmental practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The environmental group Greenpeace criticized the award to  
British Petroleum chief executive Sir John Browne, saying his 
company had a larger investment in dirty fossil fuels responsible 
for global warming than its solar energy investments.

<HEADLINE>  Officer's Report Praised Teen Gunmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Less than three months before their  
carefully planned attack on Columbine High schoolmates, Dylan 
Klebold and Eric Harris were impressing a juvenile-court officer as 
bright young men with ``a great deal of potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't the only one fooled: Neighbors and friends say they  
were reassured by the teens' middle-class backgrounds and quiet, 
``utterly normal'' family lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold, 17, and Harris, 18, were caught breaking into a van  
last year and entered a juvenile-court diversion program allowing 
them to clear their records. They finished the program in February, 
with flying colors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eric is a very bright young man who is likely to succeed in  
life. He is intelligent enough to achieve lofty goals as long as he 
stays on task and remains motivated,'' a diversion officer wrote in 
Jefferson County District Court documents released Thursday. The 
officer's name was blacked out by the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Klebold, the officer wrote: ``Dylan has earned the right for  
an early termination. ... He is intelligent enough to make any 
dream a reality but he needs to understand hard work is part of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each teen completed 45 hours of community service, received  
counseling and wrote an apology letter. Harris received additional 
counseling in anger management, which he enjoyed, the officer 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys came in and put their best face on,'' said District  
Attorney Dave Thomas, the diversion officer's boss. ``Most of us in 
the system wish we were human lie-detectors, but we're not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teens' middle-class upbringing also lulled adults into  
complacency -- even as some classmates grew alarmed at their bitter, 
vengeful tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
	At school, Klebold and Harris openly admired Hitler, hurled  
insults at minorities and conducted a running feud with the 
school's athletes. In the presence of adults, however, they were 
polite and friendly. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold lived in a home worth nearly $400,000, a modernistic  
cedar-and-glass structure tucked between two huge stone formations 
on a rural road. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Thomas Klebold, 52, is a former geophysicist who now  
runs a mortgage management business from his home. His mother, 
Susan, 50, has worked for the Colorado community-college system for 
years, helping disabled students gain access to education. 
Neighbors recall little about Dylan's older brother, Byron. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all scratching our heads right now,'' said Michael  
Briand, who knows Susan Klebold from his work as a 
community-development consultant at Arapahoe Community College. 
</P>
<P>
	Briand said Thomas Klebold is known as a liberal who favors gun  
control. Susan Klebold is a sensitive listener. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I can tell, this family was utterly, utterly  
normal,'' Briand said. ``They did everything right. But somehow the 
pain and anger was too deep, and they didn't see it or couldn't 
reach it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris moved to Littleton in 1996 from Plattsburgh, N.Y., where  
his father, Wayne Harris, was an Air Force pilot. In Littleton, the 
family bought a two-story, $184,000 home on a quiet cul-de-sac. 
Wayne Harris got a job at a flight-safety business, and his wife, 
Katherine, went to work for a catering company, according to the 
juvenile-court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors say Wayne and Katherine were quiet, sometimes waving  
across the fence while in the yard but making little effort to 
socialize. Eric's older brother, Kevin, played basketball with 
neighbors on trips home from college. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were pretty nice people, pretty quiet. They seemed to get  
along with everyone,'' said Matt Good, 16, who lives two doors 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Former neighbors in Plattsburgh remember the Harrises as a  
solid, middle-class family with a likable young son. They were 
shocked to learn that Eric Harris had shot up a school. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mouth just dropped,'' former classmate Kyle Ross said. ``He  
was a typical kid. He didn't seem anything like what is portrayed 
on TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The families were avoiding reporters, but both issued statements  
expressing sympathy for the victims, and Klebold's family wondered 
what went wrong: ``Like the rest of the country, we are struggling 
to understand why this happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Briand said Klebold's parents grew hopeful in recent months that  
their son was starting to lose his fascination with the black 
clothes and rebellious ways of ``Goth'' culture. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are also signs that Klebold's father suspected his son  
was still a threat to himself and others. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, amid TV reports of gunmen in trench coats rampaging  
through Columbine High, the elder Klebold contacted authorities, 
suspecting his son was involved and offering his help as a 
mediator. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said he was too late.

<HEADLINE> Asian Jets To Simplify Flight Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Airlines in the Asia-Pacific region will switch  
to simplified flight patterns on Dec. 31 to avoid problems with the 
Year 2000 computer bug, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``For New Year's Eve there will be a plan that's going to  
simplify the traffic patterns,'' said David Behrens, an assistant 
director at the International Air Transport Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan aims to put the need for air traffic management ``at  
its absolute minimum,'' Behrens told reporters at a two-day 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum Y2K conference in 
Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Air transport is one of the sectors most sensitive to the Y2K  
bug, an offshoot of old programming that doesn't distinguish 
between the years 1900 and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines worldwide have invested about $2.3 billion in readying  
their systems and equipment for the millennium date changeover, 
Behrens said. 
</P>
<P>
	On New Year's Eve this year, the volume of traffic on  
Asia-Pacific airways would be reduced and flight routes would be 
``de-conflicted'' under the simplified pattern, Behrens said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What that means is that airways don't cross or, if they do  
cross, they're vertically separated,'' he said. He added that 
aircraft departures would be carefully planned to put space between 
flights using the same route. 
</P>
<P>
	The simplification plan would begin taking effect in each of the  
Asia-Pacific's time zones one to two hours before midnight on Dec. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
	The special flight procedures are to be activated at 10 p.m. in  
the international date line time zone, which includes New Zealand, 
Fiji, Samoa and parts of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours later, the plan starts in places such as Australia and  
Papua New Guinea. China, the Koreas, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand, 
Singapore and other East Asian countries are slated to begin two 
hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	Normal flight patterns would resume only after air traffic  
authorities were certain they could manage flights without 
Y2K-related problems, Behrens said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that midnight on Dec. 31 Greenwich Mean Time -- 12 hours  
later than the international date line -- would be ``the most 
critical time event in the world of aviation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Midnight GMT is ``9 o'clock in the morning for Tokyo and 8  
o'clock in the morning for Beijing and Singapore, 7 o'clock for 
Bangkok -- times when the morning rush hour is departing airports,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is a joint effort by the International Air Transport  
Association, which represents most of the world's airlines, and the 
International Civil Aviation Organization, which represents state 
air transport authorities. Both groups are based in Montreal, 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asia-Pacific region is the first to announce a Y2K  
simplified flight pattern, officials at the APEC conference said. 
The area involved includes eastern Russia, Pacific island states, 
Australia, New Zealand and continental Asia up to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	Other regions are preparing air transport Y2K contingency plans  
tailored to their own conditions, Behrens and other air transport 
industry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	APEC covers Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,  
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua 
New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, 
Thailand, Vietnam and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Colo. 911 Tapes Show Early Panic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A frantic teacher implored students to  
duck under a table in the Columbine High School library as gunfire 
ricocheted outside across the hallways, according to 911 tapes 
released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's upstairs -- he's right outside of here. He's outside this  
hall,'' said a teacher identified only as Peggy, her voice cracking 
with panic. ``Kids -- JUST STAY DOWN!'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was calling from the school library, which shortly would  
become the scene of the greatest carnage -- the place where gunmen 
Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris would kill 10 students before turning 
their guns on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The 911 tapes, released by the Jefferson County sheriff's  
office, provide the first real-time glimpse into what was taking 
place inside the school during the initial moments of the shooting 
and bombing siege Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Has anyone been injured, ma'am?'' the dispatcher asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am, yes! And the school is in a panic and I'm in the  
library,'' Peggy replied. ``I've got students down. Kids -- under 
the table! My kids are screaming. Under the table, kids! And my 
teachers are trying to take control of things. We need police 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said one of the gunmen had ``turned the gun straight at us  
and shot,'' apparently hitting a male student standing with her and 
shattering a window. The dispatcher assured her that help was on 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do we know where he's at? He's outside in the hall,'' Peggy  
said. ``There's alarms and things going off and smoke. MY GOD, 
smoke is coming into this room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, six loud shots could be heard in the background.  
</P>
<P>
	``My God, the gun is right outside my door,'' Peggy said. ``OK,  
I don't think I'm going to go out there. ... I've got the kids on 
the floor. I got all of the kids in the library on the floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A female student who apparently called moments earlier tells the  
dispatcher in an even tone that a female student is in the south 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just saw everyone running. I just saw the smoke,'' the  
student said. ``People are saying there's a gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She described people streaming from the school's lunch area out  
of the building and down toward the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's running and I'm still standing here,'' the student  
said, and the dispatcher asked whether she was out of danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe so,'' said the student. ``I don't know.''  
</P>
<P>
	At that point, the fire alarm went off and the call ended.  
</P>
<P>
	Police arrived to find the school in chaos, outside and inside.  
Sheriff's Deputy Neil Gardner, regularly stationed in the school, 
had just radioed in. Tapes of the radio exchanges between police 
and dispatchers were also released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shots in the building. I need somebody in the south lot with  
me,'' Gardner radioed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner and arriving deputies spoke of possible grenades thrown  
on the roof and suspects in black trench coats -- the first mention 
of the clothing. One suspect was also described as wearing a white 
T-shirt with some sort of holster. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, a gunman was spotted on the southwest end of the  
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big gun,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen people, 12 students and a teacher, were slain when  
Klebold and Harris walked into Columbine, opened fire with an array 
of weapons and set off a variety of explosives. The gunmen, both 
Columbine students, then killed themselves.

<HEADLINE> Arena Football Opening 13th Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Following its busiest offseason, a new partnership with the NFL  
and plans for more expansion, Arena Football enters its 13th season 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner David Baker, with a five-year contract extension  
and dozens of cities clamoring to join the indoor football league, 
is even taking calls from potential team owners and from commercial 
sponsors eager to sign on. 
</P>
<P>
	``First and foremost, some of the good stuff had to do with the  
NFL,'' Baker says. ``It is a significant alliance for us. It has a 
lot of promise in terms of it speaks to the credibility of our 
sport. It's an endorsement of our credibility by the NFL and it 
gets more people playing and watching football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to marketing agreements, the NFL can buy up to 49.9  
percent of the league and have a voice in its operation. Baker's 
counterpart with the NFL, Paul Tagliabue, doesn't take the 
association with the Arena League lightly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to support football at all levels,'' Tagliabue  
says. ``An interest in the 13-year-old Arena Football League would 
enhance our stake in the future of the game, both in the United 
States and internationally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AFL phones have been ringing a lot more since the NFL deal was  
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen heightened interest by sponsors,'' he says. ``But  
just as significantly, last year we had 23 of our guys play with 
NFL teams. We've had nine coaches and now have had 10 officials go 
from the AFL to the NFL. Our alliance with the NFL has not been 
about player development, but about the business of promoting 
football. One of benefits of it is some great athletes we are 
developing are getting a chance in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``To what extent the NFL involvement has helped in our expansion  
we're not sure, but the values of our teams clearly are up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, AFL teams that once went for $500,000 now have a price  
tag of close to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Arena Football, which has a TV contract with ABC and ESPN -- a  
weekly Monday night game will appear on ESPN2 and the ArenaBowl 
championship game will be shown on ABC -- added a franchise in 
Buffalo for this season. That brought membership to 15 teams, and 
the Destroyers, who open the season at home next Friday, already 
have a season-ticket base of 12,000. That's more than some NBA 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL also has three clubs in Florida (Fort Lauderdale,  
Orlando, Tampa Bay), and teams in Nashville; East Rutherford, N.J.; 
Albany, N.Y.; Hartford, Conn.; Phoenix; San Jose, Calif.; Portland, 
Ore.; Milwaukee; Houston; Grand Rapids, Mich.; and Des Moines, 
Iowa. Chicago and New Orleans are expected to join next year. 
</P>
<P>
	A minimum arena size of 12,500 seats has been set for teams  
entering the league, which doesn't help many of the smaller cities 
seeking to be part of by far the most successful indoor offshoot of 
a major outdoor sport. 
</P>
<P>
	So the AFL is developing a grass-roots league, arenafootball2,  
which will debut next year. The idea is simple: bring professional 
football in the spring and summer to areas that have only prep and 
college football in the fall and winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we move forward with expansion, we get so many calls from  
people who run arenas or who want to put a team in an arena with 
seating below 10,000,'' Baker says. ``A whole lot of people are 
calling with arenas of 5,000-6,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes that NFL owners will run future Arena League teams.  
Saints owner Tom Benson already is involved, and Cowboys owner 
Jerry Jones and Patriots owner Robert Kraft have expressed 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, several Southern cities, including Little Rock, Ark.,  
Mobile, Ala., and Biloxi, Miss., are seriously considering 
arenafootball2. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would be a great opportunity to bring football back to  
its highest levels of popularity,'' Baker says. ``NCAA Division I's 
size seems to reduce each year, but here is a chance to take 
football into some of those smaller towns and touch people 
directly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL also is talking with NFL Europe and the CFL about  
expanding internationally. Baker has gotten calls from people in 
Japan interested in an indoor league. 
</P>
<P>
	And here's perhaps the surest sign the AFL is becoming big time:  
an Arena Football video game and a film whose plot centers around 
the sport are being developed.

<HEADLINE> Senate Moves To Limit Y2K Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate has begun debate on what many feel  
could be the real Year 2000 computer crisis -- the economic meltdown 
caused by thousands of lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very, very serious issue,'' said Sen. John McCain,  
R-Ariz., chief sponsor of legislation that seeks to limit 
litigation resulting from the so-called Y2K computer problem. ``The 
potential drain on the nation's economy and the world economy is 
staggering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One commonly cited estimate puts the litigation from Y2K at $1  
trillion, far exceeding damages sought in breast implant or 
asbestos lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's bill would give companies up to 90 days to fix computer  
problems before having to face lawsuits, and would encourage 
mediation, put caps on punitive damage and limit class action 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, as it came out of the Senate Commerce Committee McCain  
chairs, was opposed by most Democrats and the Clinton 
administration, which said it undermined consumer rights and gave 
businesses an opportunity to avoid their responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has led efforts to improve consumer  
protections in the bill, and negotiations continue to make it 
acceptable to both sides. A vote on proceeding with debate is 
scheduled for Monday. A similar bill awaits House action. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ernest Hollings of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on  
the Commerce Committee, said he still opposed the bill because it 
was backed by businesses ``interested in distorting the tort 
liability laws of America'' to their advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Three consumer groups, Consumer Union, Public Citizen and U.S.  
Public Interest Research Group, issued a statement last week saying 
the McCain bill and other Y2K litigation bills ``would restrict the 
rights that individual and small-business consumers have under 
current law and would undermine incentives for companies to correct 
Y2K defects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the National Association of Manufacturers, in a letter,  
urged Congress to pass legislation, saying a flood of contentious 
litigation ``could have serious consequences for consumers in 
higher prices, workers in lost jobs and our technology pre-eminence 
in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem could arise when computers that use only two  
digits to read dates mistake the year 2000, or ``00,'' as 1900, 
resulting in computer systems putting out wrong information or 
breaking down. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate special panel on the Y2K problem, chaired by Sen.  
Robert Bennett, R-Utah, heard testimony on Thursday from oil 
experts who concluded that the U.S. oil industry has prepared for 
the millennium bug and had the reserves to handle short-term 
cutoffs in supplies from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Kripowicz, the Energy Department's principal deputy  
assistant secretary for fossil energy, expressed ``cautious 
optimism'' that oil producers, shippers and refiners would be ready 
by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the oil industry's built-in flexibility because of its  
experiences in handling natural disasters and its financial 
incentive to keep oil flowing and the nation's Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve, which now holds an inventory of 561 million barrels of 
crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States imports some 10.4 million barrels of oil a  
day, 56 percent of the nation's consumption. Kripowicz said up to 
4.1 million barrels a day could be withdrawn from the reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Major suppliers -- Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Mexico and Canada --  
are making serious efforts to prepare their computer systems, 
although there are ``gaps'' in the department's information about 
other producing nations, Kripowicz said. 
</P>
<P>
	William Ramsay of the Paris-based International Energy Agency  
also cautioned that ``a few minor glitches can compound to create 
bottlenecks.'' He said some experts are predicting that Y2K-related 
problems ``could last into the second quarter as problems compound 
down the supply chain over time.''

<HEADLINE> Watson Family Gets Hollywood Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Watson family -- dubbed the First Family  
of Hollywood for appearing in more than 1,000 films since 1911 -- 
was honored with a group star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the siblings were at Thursday's unveiling ceremony:  
Harry, Delmar, Garry, Bill, Coy and Louise Watson Roberts. Bobs 
Watson, 68, is the youngest but was unable to attend because he is 
ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The acting family included two more sisters and their father,  
Coy, who have died. Coy Watson Jr. is the oldest sibling at 86. 
</P>
<P>
	``Better than getting this star is that we are able to see our  
old friends and family,'' said Delmar Watson, who spoke for the 
family. ``Because Watson is family and family is Watson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among their credits: Delmar Watson played Peter the goat boy in  
``Heidi,'' Harry appeared in ``A Damsel in Distress,'' and four of 
the Watson kids were Jimmy Stewart's family in ``Mr. Smith Goes to 
Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most recently, Bob Watson made ``Deadly Delusions,'' which will  
be released this summer.

<HEADLINE> Man Guilty in Pizza Delivery Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWTON, N.J. (AP) -- A 20-year-old man was convicted of murder  
Friday for luring two pizza delivery men to an abandoned cabin and 
then fatally shooting one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Koskovich could be sentenced to death by injection for  
the April 19, 1997 murder of delivery man Jeremy Giordano. 
Authorities did not charge him in both killings because they said 
his accomplice shot and killed the second man. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury deliberated eight hours over two days before convicting  
Koskovich of murder, robbery, burglary, theft and weapons offenses. 
The jury will begin considering his penalty Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Koskovich and Jayson Vreeland just wanted to  
see what it felt like to kill, and that Koskovich carefully planned 
the shootings by taking guns out for target practice, and trying to 
recruit his friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the two called a half-dozen pizza parlors  
before finding one that would deliver to an abandoned cabin in 
rural northwestern New Jersey. The county has the state's lowest 
crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys argued that Koskovich was too drugged on  
prescription pain killers to know what he was doing, and that he 
only plotted to rob Giordano and pizza shop owner Giorgio Gallara. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from adjusting his chair in the courtroom, Koskovich did  
not react to the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he confessed, he reportedly refused offers to plead  
guilty to avoid the death penalty. Last summer, Koskovich attempted 
suicide in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Vreeland, 19, has not been tried yet. He does not face the death  
penalty because he was a juvenile at the time of the shooting.

<HEADLINE> Man Who Faked Death Gets 18 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) -- A fugitive who tried to fake his death  
in the stormy Atlantic surf to avoid prosecution was sentenced 
today to 18 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Mandarino Jr., a heroin addict and petty criminal  
already serving a five-year sentence for eluding police, was 
ordered to serve the 18-month term at the end of his current 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	He must also pay at least $10,000 in restitution to would-be  
rescuers who braved treacherous seas during a two-day search 
stemming from the Aug. 24 hoax. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandarino, 24, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and causing a false  
public alarm and apologized in court, saying his heroin use clouded 
his judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Mandarino persuaded his fiancee, Kimberly Kuda,  
22, to tell police he disappeared while wading in knee-deep water 
at Point Pleasant Beach. Hurricane Bonnie had churned up seas all 
along the East Coast, forcing beach closings and many rescues. 
</P>
<P>
	After a two-day search by more than 100 people, including divers  
and helicopter pilots, rescuers concluded Mandarino had drowned. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities became suspicious after learning Mandarino had a  
Sept. 14 court date to face charges of passing bad checks. 
Mandarino and Ms. Kuda eventually were tracked down. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kuda previously was sentenced to three years' probation in  
the case.

<HEADLINE> East Timor Autonomy Plan Date Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Portuguese and Indonesian foreign  
ministers have agreed to sign a U.N. autonomy proposal for East 
Timor early next month, paving the way for a historic ballot on the 
territory's future, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan announced the May 5 signing date on the third and final  
day of U.N.-sponsored talks, saying it would give Indonesia time to 
approve two additional documents on security arrangements and how 
the ballot will be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan said the meetings were ``very productive and successful,''  
and urged Indonesia to ``effectively carry out its responsibility 
for law and order and the protection of civilians'' in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence on the half-island territory has intensified since  
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie -- in a surprise reversal -- 
announced in January that Indonesia would grant the Timorese 
independence if they reject autonomy. Indonesia invaded East Timor 
in 1975 and later annexed it. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations is planning to oversee the ballot that will  
determine whether East Timor's 800,000 people want to remain with 
Indonesia or break free. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said there were ``no  
sticking points'' but the final text had to be put before the 
Cabinet in Jakarta. ``Hopefully they will agree,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The date for a ballot has been set but was not announced.  
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama indicated that a July ballot 
was still feasible. Alatas said it would be held before the end of 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the wide-ranging autonomy package, the kind of  
ballot, and the security arrangements were not disclosed, although 
Alatas did say U.N. civilian police would probably be part of the 
U.N. contingent sent to East Timor to organize the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	He stressed, however, that Indonesia will continue to shoulder  
the main responsibility for security in East Timor leading up to 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no foreign peacekeeping forces,'' Alatas said.  
``The Indonesian military and the Indonesian police are determined 
to take their responsibility to keep law and order and peace and 
tranquility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, the Indonesian military and local residents denied  
allegations that pro-Indonesian militiamen killed more than 100 
people this week in a town in East Timor. The Timorese Democratic 
Union, a pro-independence group based in Australia, said in a 
statement that civilian fighters massacred separatist sympathizers 
and burned homes in Suai. It cited two sources described as 
``reliable'' but did not identify them. 
</P>
<P>
	The story of killing in Suai ``has been engineered in order to  
destabilize the situation,'' said Col. Tono Suratman, East Timor's 
military commander.

<HEADLINE> Colorado High School Students Edgy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Just three miles from Columbine High  
School, shaken students returned to classes at rival Chatfield High 
for the first time since Tuesday's shootings. They quickly learned 
that school life might never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Fear followed their every step.  
</P>
<P>
	Armed sheriff's deputies stood guard Thursday. Teachers wearing  
name tags watched all the doors. Staff, faculty and counselors 
tried to help the kids cope with the deaths of 15 people at 
Columbine. But the harder they tried, the harder it became for some 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Holly Bernside, 15, said she knew ``it was just too much when my  
computer teacher asked if we would feel better if she shut the 
door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For some, the tension was too much to bear. They broke down in  
tears. Dozens streamed out of school hours early. 
</P>
<P>
	``All they wanted to talk about was what happened at  
Columbine,'' said Ms. Bernside's friend, Jessica Miller, also 15. 
The two sophomores decided to call their parents for permission to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a prison in there,'' Ms. Miller said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rumors quickly spread that ``Chatfield would be next,'' said Ms.  
Miller. Parents drove up and asked a reporter if it was true that a 
student was barricaded inside a classroom. It wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Students were forbidden to leave their backpacks lying around.  
Some of the bombs used in the assault at Columbine were planted in 
knapsacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrival of two bomb squad trucks with sirens blaring further  
shook those inside. The bomb squad was called because a backpack 
had been found unattended in a hallway. It contained books.

<HEADLINE> Missing Children Focus of Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The widening global market is producing more  
international marriages -- and with them, divorces that can lead to 
parents abducting their children to foreign countries, Hillary 
Rodham Clinton said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In a ceremony to launch the creation of the International Centre  
for Missing and Exploited Children, the first lady said too many 
parents are realizing what little can be done to enforce custody 
laws overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an international issue, and this is a human rights  
issue,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining her in the announcement was Cherie Blair, wife of  
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who said the organization will 
help publicize the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really need to raise awareness of this type of abuse,''  
Mrs. Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was made in the residential quarters of the  
British Embassy, the home of Catherine Meyer and her husband, 
Ambassador Christopher Meyer. Mrs. Meyer helped begin the 
organization after her two sons were abducted by their father while 
visiting him in Germany five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The center's objective will be to provide technology to help  
track missing children, establish adequate law enforcement, and 
help raise awareness about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said the organization should also put teeth in the  
Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction, a treaty that provides for the speedy return of children 
taken from their home country. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, ratified by the United States in 1988, asks judges  
not to determine custody but merely to return abducted children to 
their home country so courts there can take up the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a complicated, changing world, we do not forget that we  
must -- we must -- have rules and standards that we follow even if 
they are personally inconvenient. That is what the rule of law 
means,'' Mrs. Clinton said.

<HEADLINE>  Puzzles of Colo. Gunmen Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Dylan Klebold, one of the Columbine High  
gunmen said by classmates to have openly admired Adolf Hitler, was 
the great-grandson of a prominent Jewish philanthropist in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one more puzzle regarding the pair of misfit teens who  
worried other students with their talk of vengeance but impressed 
some adults, including a court officer, as bright young men with 
promising futures. 
</P>
<P>
	Long before Tuesday's murderous rampage, Klebold, 17, was known  
around his high school as an admirer of Hitler and the Nazis. He 
and fellow gunman Eric Harris, 18, would talk German in the 
hallways and hurl insults at Jews, blacks and Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Klebold's mother, Susan Klebold, is the granddaughter of the  
late Leo Yassenoff, a wealthy commercial real-estate developer in 
Columbus, Ohio, and a prominent figure in the Jewish community 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Yassenoff was active at the Temple Israel and donated enough  
money to the Jewish Community Center of Columbus that it named the 
center after him. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Klebold was ``definitely brought up Jewish,'' said Skip  
Yassenoff, 49, a distant cousin who grew up with her in Columbus. 
Yassenoff said Susan's husband, Thomas Klebold, is not Jewish; he 
said he didn't know how Dylan and his older brother, Byron, were 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how it can be more awful,'' said Yassenoff, who  
still lives in Columbus. ``I really can't imagine the pain of my 
cousin and her husband and the parents of the other boy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Littleton, court officials anguished over another  
contradictory side of Harris and Klebold: Less than three months 
before their carefully planned assault, they convinced a court 
officer that they had great prospects for staying out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-agers last year entered a so-called diversion program  
that enabled them to clear their records after they were caught 
breaking into a car. They performed 45 hours of community service, 
received counseling and wrote apology letters. Harris also received 
anger-management counseling, which he enjoyed, his diversion 
officer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eric is a very bright young man who is likely to succeed in  
life,'' the unnamed officer wrote in court documents. ``He is 
intelligent enough to achieve lofty goals as long as he stays on 
task and remains motivated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Dylan has earned the right for an early termination,'' the  
officer wrote. ``He is intelligent enough to make any dream a 
reality but he needs to understand hard work is part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Dave Thomas said the teens made a calculated  
effort to impress their diversion officer. Thomas said the officer 
is so upset that he is worried about him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's anguishing over what happened here,'' Thomas said. ``He's  
a very dedicated, committed public servant. He did the best he 
could, I believe. Most of us in the system wish we were human 
lie-detectors, but we're not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officer's name has not been released; it was blacked out on  
the documents provided to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Other adults said they were lulled into complacency by the  
teens' middle-class upbringing and caring parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold lived in a home worth nearly $400,000, a modernistic  
cedar-and-glass structure tucked between two huge stone formations 
on a rural road. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Klebold, 52, is a former geophysicist who now runs a  
mortgage management business from his home. His wife, 50, has 
worked for the Colorado community-college system for years, helping 
disabled students gain access to education. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Briand, who knows Ms. Klebold from his work as a  
community-development consultant at Arapahoe Community College, 
said Thomas Klebold is a liberal who favors gun control, and Ms. 
Klebold is a sensitive listener. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I can tell, this family was utterly, utterly  
normal,'' Briand said. ``They did everything right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris moved to Littleton in 1996 from Plattsburgh, N.Y., where  
his father, Wayne Harris, was an Air Force pilot. In Littleton, the 
family bought a two-story, $184,000 home on a quiet cul-de-sac. 
Wayne Harris got a job at a flight-safety business, and his wife, 
Katherine, worked for a catering company, according to court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said the couple were quiet, sometimes waving across  
the fence but making little effort to socialize. Eric's older 
brother, Kevin, played basketball with neighbors on trips home from 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were pretty nice people, pretty quiet,'' said Matt Good,  
16, who lives two doors away. ``They seemed to get along with 
everyone.''

<HEADLINE> Cause of Army Chopper Crash Unknown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The bodies of seven soldiers killed in a Black Hawk helicopter  
crash at an Army base in Kentucky were to be released to their 
families today. 
</P>
<P>
	The UH-60L twin-turbine helicopter went down in a remote, wooded  
area of Fort Campbell during a training mission on Thursday 
morning. Army investigators have not yet determined the cause of 
the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers' caskets were to pass through a cordon of military  
personnel from their units at Campbell Army Airfield before being 
flown today to Dover, Del., for final processing. 
</P>
<P>
	Killed in the crash were: Spec. Anthony W. Brown, 29; Pfc. Earl  
C. Eoff, 29; Sgt. Robert G. Millward, 32; Spec. James R. Murphy 
Jr., 25; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Aaron K. Power, 30; Spec. Fury J. 
Rice, 21; Sgt. Julius R. Wilkes Jr., 23. Hometowns were not 
provided. 
</P>
<P>
	Four soldiers who survived the crash remain hospitalized.  
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers from the 101st Aviation Regiment were practicing  
either getting on or off the Black Hawk when it crashed, probably 
from a fairly low height, said Fort Campbell spokesman George 
Heath. 
</P>
<P>
	The Black Hawk is the Army's primary helicopter for air assault,  
air cavalry and medical evacuation units. More than 1,500 now serve 
with active duty and National Guard units worldwide.

<HEADLINE> NATO Members Taking Responsibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After years of knocking on NATO's doors, its  
newest members -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic -- pledged 
today to live up to the privileges of the membership they finally 
have won. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is now reality was once only imagined,'' Viktor Orban,  
Hungary's prime minister, said during a ceremony at the Capitol 
celebrating the alliance's 50th birthday and welcoming the three 
European democracies into the fold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can assure you that Hungarian hearts will not forget your  
invaluable part in Hungary becoming a NATO member,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For Poland, which has wanted to join since 1989, membership is a  
``grand gesture of friendship, good will and trust,'' said its 
president, Aleksander Kwasniewski. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO membership is a challenge we will meet,'' he declared.  
</P>
<P>
	Vaclav Havel, the first elected president of the Czech Republic,  
said his country, too, was grateful for the privilege of belonging 
to the 19-member union. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me assure you that the citizens of the Czech Republic are  
well aware of what membership in the NATO alliance means to them,'' 
said Havel, a writer, dramatist and leader of the underground 
democratic movement. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's leader, Javier Solana, also welcomed them, saying their  
membership ``ranks among the finest hours in the history of our 
Atlantic alliance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Yugoslavia, Solana, said, ``our fundamental values are being  
threatened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the 20th century, we cannot allow this to happen  
and we will not allow this to happen,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen, Secretary of State Madeleine  
Albright and Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, were among the dignitaries in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said that for those  
who question whether there is still a need for the alliance, ``the 
answer is found in today's newspaper headlines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who presided over the  
ceremony, did not mention the conflict. He commended the countries' 
perseverance in pursuing NATO membership. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your undying dedication to liberty has brought you true  
freedom,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  NATO Resolves To Continue Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO leaders, having declared their  
determination to bomb Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic into 
submission, are moving to the key questions of the alliance's 
future -- and the possibility of more Kosovos. 
</P>
<P>
	The crisis in the southern province of Serbia, where Yugoslav  
army and special police forces are attempting to empty the province 
of its ethnic Albanian majority, dominated the first day of the 
three-day NATO summit and put a damper on what was to have been a 
celebration of the alliance's 50 years of maintaining the peace in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 19 countries around the table today have determined that  
brutality cannot prevail in Europe,'' NATO Secretary-General Javier 
Solana told reporters Friday at the end of a long session on 
Kosovo, where the allies pledged not to allow Milosevic's 
``campaign of terror to succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme allied commander, acknowledged  
that Milosevic ``has shown a willingness to accept a high level of 
damage,'' after 31 days of allied air operations. But he added: 
</P>
<P>
	``In short, we're winning. He's losing. And he knows it.''  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton led the 19 presidents and prime ministers  
through the sweet-solemn occasion of dealing with Milosevic's 
``deliberate policy of oppression, ethnic cleansing and violence'' 
and commemorating the founding a half-century ago of one of the 
world's most successful and enduring alliances. 
</P>
<P>
	``We meet to honor NATO's past, to chart its future, to reaffirm  
our mission in Kosovo, where NATO is defending our values and our 
vision of a Europe free, undivided and at peace,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toasting ``NATO and its future'' at a White House dinner with  
the other leaders Friday night, the president said the alliance is 
fighting ``to protect the innocent families, the children and to 
stand for the values that we have stood for as an organization for 
50 years now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Setting Kosovo aside, the leaders were moving today to approval  
of NATO's strategic concept, essentially the alliance's basic 
principles: the European Security and Defense Identity. The program 
allows European countries freedom to conduct operations in which 
the United States is not interested, but using NATO assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The program includes a new Defense Capability Initiative, an  
attempt to head off a growing technology gap between U.S. military 
forces and the rest of the allies. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategic concept outlines the threats of the future against  
which NATO will have to defend, among them regional and ethnic 
conflicts like Kosovo, terrorism, proliferation and weapons of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the agenda is a program setting out required steps for  
aspirant members, a sort of road map to joining NATO; the enhanced 
Partnership for Peace program, wherein non-member countries get 
involved in NATO activities which may or may not lead to 
membership; increased dialogue with Mediterranean countries; and 
creation of a new center to deal with weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The major difference over the new strategic concept, which will  
replace the one last revised in 1991, concerns the alliance's 
relations with the United Nations. Essentially, France and a number 
of other European countries want to set out specifically the 
conditions under which NATO can take military action outside its 
traditional Euro-Atlantic area. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, while agreeing the United Nations should play  
a pre-eminent role, feels the issue is adequately addressed in 
NATO's founding treaty and prefers to leave the details vague. This 
would allow the alliance to act on its own under special 
circumstances -- Kosovo being the perfect example. A Russian veto 
would have prohibited any NATO action in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a wide difference between President Clinton and me on  
the need to ask the United Nations (before taking action),'' French 
President Jacques Chirac said after meeting with Clinton on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The allies dismissed a Russian initiative to settle the conflict  
since Belgrade still refused to accept a NATO-led military force to 
enforce peace. Still, the leaders said they wanted to work 
constructively with Russia and that Moscow had ``an important role 
to play in the search for a solution to the conflict in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the 19 NATO nations were expected to acknowledge the  
nine countries now seeking membership in the alliance. Each 
candidate will be asked to provide NATO with an action plan, and in 
return will receive feedback, advice and help in defense planning.

<HEADLINE> Nomo is No More With Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Hideo Nomo experiment is no more. At least  
not in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Cubs released the former NL Rookie of the Year on  
Friday after he declined to stay in the minors for two more starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement with the Cubs, Nomo was to make three starts  
for Triple-A Iowa and then Chicago would either promote him to the 
majors with an $800,000 base salary plus incentives that could 
total another $2 million, ask him to stay longer in the minors or 
release him. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs general manager Ed Lynch watched Nomo's shaky outing  
Thursday in Des Moines and after consulting with other team 
officials determined the right-hander was not ready to help the 
major league team. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch asked Nomo's agent, Don Nomura, if his client would agree  
to two more starts at Iowa. Nomura said no and so the Cubs released 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nomo's third start with Iowa, he walked six, struck out four  
and gave up three hits and two runs in six innings during a 3-1 
loss to Memphis. He threw 51 strikes and 47 balls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked at the quality of his pitches and command,'' Lynch,  
a former major league pitcher, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have someone who has either very good command or  
overpowering stuff, one of the two, you could justify bringing him 
to your major league club. We just didn't see the command or stuff 
that we felt was good enough to get major league hitters out. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's our opinion. I'm sure he has a different opinion of his  
command and his stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo and Nomura were not available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Nomo was waived by the New York Mets this spring and the Cubs,  
hungry for pitching with Kerry Wood out for the season following 
elbow surgery, signed Nomo to a Triple-A deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs also have three other pitchers currently on the  
disabled list -- starters Kevin Tapani and Jeremi Gonzalez and 
reliever Terry Adams. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch said he was disappointed that it didn't work out. He said  
Nomo may have a chance of regaining his form by summer but insisted 
he wasn't ready at this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been a nice boost to add a pitcher of his name  
to our staff,'' Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it was fair to our club right now to bring him  
to the major leagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo's previous two outings at Iowa were more encouraging than  
his third. He allowed five earned runs in 11 innings. In his second 
appearance against Las Vegas, he pitched six shutout innings and 
struck out 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo's major league record is 49-41 with a 3.66 ERA in four  
seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Mets, but he faltered last 
season. He went 2-7 before the Dodgers dealt him to the Mets in 
June in a four-player deal. 
</P>
<P>
	He was ineffective this spring, going 0-2 with a 7.62 ERA in  
four appearances, before the Mets gave up on him. They sent him to 
Triple-A Norfolk outright March 24 and put him on unconditional 
release waivers two days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo was the NL's Rookie of the Year in 1995 when he struck out  
236 and allowed hitters just a .182 average.

<HEADLINE> Woody Allen Memorabilia Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It could be the ``Sleeper'' of the auction  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Props and memorabilia from a decade of Woody Allen films are  
tagged for auction today -- everything from 1930s mahogany radio 
consoles from ``Radio Days'' to the head of John the Baptist from 
``Deconstructing Harry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leopard spotted chairs in which Mira Sorvino sat in ``Mighty  
Aphrodite'' lean against a '30s Coca-Cola sign. Across the way is 
the wave machine from the desktop where Joe Montegna made love to 
Judy Davis in ``Celebrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tags put on Friday represent numbers from 432 lots, but there  
are no estimates on how much items in the eclectic collection will 
bring. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not your ordinary auction,'' said Richard Brick, a  
co-producer on Allen's last three films and organizer of the sale. 
``We basically just have to clean out our attic, so to speak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sale is not a case of ``Take the Money and Run.'' Proceeds  
from the auction, to be held this weekend in a Long Island City 
warehouse, will go to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time in Allen's quarter century of  
movie-making that his cinema props have gone up for auction like 
this, Brick said. The items are owned by Jean Doumanian, who has 
produced seven of Allen's films over the past seven years and has 
been his executive producer since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Items drawing the most interest include a pair of gold and red  
down-filled sofas used in ``Crimes and Misdemeanors'' and ``Bullets 
over Broadway,'' and five 1930s billiard tables from Allen's 
still-untitled movie with Sean Penn and Uma Thurman, due out this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Also up for sale is Drew Barrymore's vanity set from ``Everyone  
Says I Love You,'' Sorvino's gaudy 1970s lamps from ``Mighty 
Aphrodite'' and dozens of costumes and signs, many of them from the 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	Madigan Ryan, an actress who played small parts in ``Radio  
Days'' and ``Hannah and Her Sisters,'' wandered around with her 
boyfriend, Tom Loback, examining the props and clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may get a radio just for the kick of it,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Drummond Has Spinal Meningitis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Jon Drummond, the world's fifth-ranked  
100-meter runner and the 1997 U.S. 200 champion, is battling spinal 
meningitis for the third time in his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Drummond was hospitalized Sunday, after waking up with a high  
fever, Erin Kendrigan, spokeswoman for HSI, the team for which he 
runs, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Drummond, 30, was born with spina bifida and his parents were  
told that he would be mentally retarded and unable to walk. He had 
his first battle with spinal meningitis -- a swelling of the 
membrane around the brain and spinal cord -- in 1986 and was 
hospitalized nearly four weeks, his manager, Emanuel Hudson, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years later, Drummond was in the hospital again because of  
the illness, but he was out in less than a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he is in Cedar Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. When he will  
be released is uncertain, Kendrigan said.

<HEADLINE> How U.S. Uncovered China's Spying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To figure out how much China may have gained  
from spying on American nuclear weapons labs, U.S. intelligence 
agents had to do quite a bit of spying of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	There were electronic intercepts, development of friendly  
Chinese assets and perhaps the biggest break of all -- a Chinese 
government document in 1995 that showed Beijing had obtained U.S. 
secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a source give us a document that contained classified  
U.S. information, and it was a Chinese document,'' said one senior 
intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials determined that information in the document the  
Chinese ``could only have obtained through espionage,'' the 
official explained. 
</P>
<P>
	``That sounds like a bit of an intelligence coup by the United  
States,'' said John Pike of the Federation of American Scientists, 
a Washington-based group that researches intelligence issues. 
</P>
<P>
	There's been plenty of outrage and promises to improve security  
since U.S. officials confirmed that lax security at the Energy 
Department's nuclear weapons labs allowed Chinese spies to obtain 
U.S. secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	But lost in public debate was how much spying on China the  
Americans did. 
</P>
<P>
	For intelligence officials, that's just fine. They know that  
Beijing is watching every word from Washington, looking for signs 
of how much U.S. spies have uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
	CIA insiders winced at the idea that a version of the final  
damage assessment was going to be released publicly, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The assessment presented to President Clinton and lawmakers on  
Wednesday focused on how China used the secrets it obtained through 
espionage along with information gleaned at public sources such as 
scientific conferences to improve its nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The report concluded that China will be able to develop smaller,  
lighter nuclear warheads adaptable to multiple-warhead missiles. 
Beijing is within a few years of fielding such a weapon, the report 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing has denied any spying, saying its own scientists were  
capable of developing improved nuclear weapons without stolen U.S. 
secrets. The U.S. doesn't bother to make such denials about its 
spying. 
</P>
<P>
	The damage report was assembled by nuclear weapons and China  
experts from the CIA, FBI, Pentagon, Department of Energy and 
National Security Agency. Throughout it are indications of the 
extent of U.S. spying. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, it was first reported that China had gained  
information on just the W-88 warhead aboard nuclear submarines and 
the neutron bomb. Unclassified reports said China also obtained 
secrets about several reentry vehicles -- the nuclear weapons used 
in multiple-warhead missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The classified version of the report gave specific dates when  
new Chinese weapons might be deployed -- another coup for U.S. 
spying, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even those who criticized Clinton for moving too slowly on  
security at the Energy labs were impressed with the intelligence 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a thorough briefing,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby,  
R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., the committee's vice chairman, agreed.  
``There is both a failure and a success story in this evaluation,'' 
Kerry said, referring to the Chinese ability to steal U.S. nuclear 
secrets and the intelligence community's subsequent success in 
tracking down what China gained.

<HEADLINE> GM Chairman Won't Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. vice chairman Harry Pearce  
says chairman Jack Smith is full of energy and has no plans to step 
down early, contrary to recent speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce, 56, recently returned to work full time after undergoing  
nearly a year of successful treatment for leukemia. His high 
profile in the past week, which has included a packed schedule of 
media interviews, has increased talk that Pearce is again being 
groomed to succeed Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important that we put to rest a lot of the  
speculation that has arisen,'' Pearce said Friday. ``Jack Smith has 
done an extraordinary job leading the turnaround at General Motors. 
He's healthy, he's young -- and believe me, I view 61 as young these 
days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce said GM's management team works well together.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're not running for each other's jobs and, quite frankly,  
that's not always the way it has been at GM,'' Pearce said during 
an interview with Detroit-based auto writers. ``It's an extremely 
healthy relationship. It's the way a large, complex company ought 
to be managed, and we all have plenty to do in our own respective 
jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when asked if he felt up to the task of running GM, Pearce  
said his health was not an issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I owe the company is 100 percent of my capability,'' he  
said. ``I owe the company what I hope I was delivering before all 
of this happened. They day that I believe I'm not delivering 100 
percent, I'll be on Jack's doorstep and on the door step of the 
board telling them I'm not up to the task anymore and I need to 
retire. I don't envision that happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce has said his battle with leukemia made him less  
egocentric and more willing to appreciate the importance of 
recognizing the contributions of others. He noted that he received 
words of support during his illness from UAW leaders, including 
president Stephen Yokich and vice president Richard Shoemaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``That support is something I will never forget,'' Pearce said.  
</P>
<P>
	His new attitude may also be reflected in GM's efforts to forge  
a more cooperative relationship with the United Auto Workers as the 
union and company prepare for triennial contract negotiations later 
this year. GM has had a far more contentious relationship with the 
UAW than Ford Motor Co. or DaimlerChrysler AG. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to work very hard on both sides of the table to  
develop a relationship based upon trust and mutual respect.'' 
Pearce said. ``We're in this business together, and our hourly 
workers are as important as our salaried workers. They all play a 
role in the ultimate success of the business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce has acknowledged that GM did not properly handle last  
year's dispute with the UAW in Flint, Mich., which led to two 
costly strikes that virtually shut down the company in North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to get away from the old confrontational days,'' he  
said. ``Strikes are a huge problem for the business, they're a 
problem for the country, they're a problem for our work force. They 
are destructive, they make no sense, and that is not the way we 
need to solve our problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce said GM will work for a new contract that treats both  
sides fairly, but ``ensures the future competitiveness of the 
company.'' The former trial lawyer also indicated that his new 
attitude doesn't mean he'll be a pushover. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you can be a kind and gentler person and still be a  
tough negotiator,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cards' Tatis Sets Grand Slam Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- St. Louis' Fernando Tatis, who had not hit a  
grand slam in his career, became the only player in major league 
history to hit two in one inning Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Tatis also set a big league record with his eight RBIs in one  
inning. The previous record was six, shared by several players. 
</P>
<P>
	Tatis, playing in his 226th big league game, hit both grand  
slams in the third inning against the Dodgers' Chan Ho Park as the 
Cardinals scored 11 times to take an 11-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only the 10th time in major league history that a player  
had two grand slams in a game, and just the second time in National 
League history. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Cloninger, a former Braves pitcher, had been the only NL  
player to hit two slams in one game. 
</P>
<P>
	Tatis, who had just 24 homers in his career, including four this  
year, hit a 2-0 fastball from Park deep into the left-field 
bullpen, with nobody out. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after Mark McGwire had flied out to shallow right field to  
leave the bases loaded with two out, Tatis lined Park's 3-2 pitch 
into the left-field pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
	Park, who faced 13 batters in the inning, finally was taken out  
of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers' right-hander became the first pitcher in this  
century -- and only the second ever -- to give up two grand slams in 
one inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The other was Bill Phillips of the Pittsburgh Pirates, against  
the Chicago Cubs in 1890. 
</P>
<P>
	Tatis, a slight 5-foot-10, 170-pounder, is a native of the  
Dominican Republic who came to the Cardinals in a trade with Texas 
last July. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a .270 career batting average after slightly more than 1 1/2  
years of major league service. He hit .287 in 55 games for the 
Cardinals last year.

<P>
	Today is Saturday, April 24, the 114th day of 1999. There are  
251 days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On April 24, 1916, some 1,600 Irish nationalists launched the  
Easter Rising by seizing several key sites in Dublin, including the 
General Post Office. The rising was put down by British forces 
several days later. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1792, the national anthem of France, ``La Marseillaise,'' was  
composed by Capt. Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1800, Congress approved a bill establishing the Library of  
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1898, Spain declared war on the United States after rejecting  
America's ultimatum to withdraw from Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1915, the Ottoman Turkish Empire began the brutal mass  
deportation of Armenians during World War I. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, British statesman Winston Churchill was knighted by  
Queen Elizabeth II. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1968, leftist students at Columbia University in New York  
began a week-long occupation of several campus buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, the United States launched an abortive attempt to free  
the American hostages in Iran, a mission that resulted in the 
deaths of eight U.S. servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, the space shuttle Discovery blasted off from Cape  
Canaveral, Florida, carrying the Hubble Space Telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: President Bush led a memorial service at the  
Norfolk Naval Station in Virginia for the 47 sailors killed in a 
gun-turret explosion aboard the USS Iowa. Richard M. Daley was 
inaugurated as the 45th mayor of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: Bosnian Serbs, threatened with NATO air strikes,  
grudgingly gave up their three-week assault on Gorazde, burning 
houses and blowing up a water treatment plant as they withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: After a month of confrontation, Russian lawmakers  
caved in to President Boris Yeltsin, approving acting prime 
minister Sergei Kiriyenko, 35, as premier despite doubts about his 
relative youth and inexperience. Kiriyenko was fired just four 
months later.

	Thought for Today: ``The door to the past is a strange door. It  
swings open and things pass through it, but they pass in one 
direction only. No man can return across that threshold, though he 
can look down still and see the green light waver in the water 
weeds.'' -- Loren Eiseley, American anthropologist (1907-1977).

</P>
<P>
	The propane tank bomb was set up with an egg timer and had  
matches tied to a fuse from a model rocket. When the egg timer went 
off, it would trigger the match, which would light the fuse and 
ignite a gas can next to the propane tank, said Lawrence 
Bettendorf, an Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent. He didn't know 
why the bomb did not go off. 
</P>
<P>
	Explosives expert Sid Woodcock, a consultant to the defense in

are ``fairly sophisticated'' and that just one of them ``probably 
would have destroyed a good part of the school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the pipe bombs were filled with nails to maximize their  
killing power. Published reports said broken glass also was used to 
fill the bombs.

<HEADLINE> Chernobyl Virus Is Coming Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Companies that sell software to combat  
computer viruses are warning that a bug may be biting hard drives 
around the world on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Chernobyl virus -- expected to hit on the 13th  
anniversary of the nuclear disaster -- tries to delete the first 
megabyte of data on all hard drives and overwrite some memory on 
the 26th of the month, according to Tokyo-based Trend Micro. 
</P>
<P>
	In the worst cases, the virus could leave a computer unbootable,  
and users would have to purchase a new chip or have the data 
restored, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are several similar variants of the virus, though they  
differ primarily in their trigger dates -- April 26, May 26, or the 
26th of any month. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus infects Windows files, according to Symantec Corp.  
</P>
<P>
	When an infected program is run, it infects the computer's  
memory before hitting new files as they are opened. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen companies are offering protective software  
that can be downloaded from the World Wide Web.

<HEADLINE> District's Bond Rating Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- District of Columbia general obligation bonds  
are a better bet than they used to be. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street rating firm Standard &AMP; Poor's raised the city's  
bond rating from junk bond status or ``BB'' to ``BBB'' Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rating upgrades are based on the district's improved  
financial and administrative factors,'' said Standard &AMP; Poor's 
analyst Parry Young. He cited the district's ability to post budget 
surpluses during the past two years as one of the ``big drivers'' 
of the ratings upgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big deal,'' said Marilyn Cohen, president of Envision  
Capital Management, who manages bond portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
	The upgrade indicates Wall Street is more confident now that the  
city can pay the principal and interest on its bonds back in a 
timely fashion, Cohen said. That could make a difference when the 
district tries to raise $500 million through bond sales in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors ``who swooped in and bought D.C. bonds when others  
were selling them have made a mint'' off of the new rating, Cohen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The change, which does not affect $1 billion in outstanding  
general obligation debt, is expected to save D.C. taxpayers 
millions of dollars in future transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The revenues that this upgrade will bring can mean lower  
taxes, better services and a greater investment in children and 
youth,'' said Mayor Tony Williams, who along with D.C. Council 
Chairwoman Linda Cropp met earlier this month with Standard &AMP; 
Poor's representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Confidence in the district government's management and  
financial responsibility is growing,'' Cropp said in response to 
the upgrade. ``The city is establishing a track record of balancing 
the budget, improving service delivery and making capital 
improvements.''

<HEADLINE> Houston TV Analyst Scoops Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The first American interview given by Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic since the NATO bombing began went to a 
local TV analyst from Houston whose trip was paid for by a 
businessman of Serbian and Croatian descent. 
</P>
<P>
	The scoop by Houston's KHOU-TV came despite efforts to speak to  
Milosevic by major network correspondents, including CBS's Dan 
Rather. 
</P>
<P>
	But it left the station defending the propriety of having  
interviewer Ron Hatchett's trip paid for by someone with a clear 
point of view on the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip's sponsor, Bob Koprivica of Butte, Mont., has called  
reports of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo ``a lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	KHOU news director Mike Devlin said the Yugoslavs placed no  
restrictions on what Hatchett could ask during Monday's interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy nagged the hell out of the Yugoslavs and he got in,''  
Devlin said. ``He asked all the appropriate questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatchett is director of the Center for International Studies at  
Houston's University of Saint Thomas and is a paid military analyst 
for KHOU. Koprivica is an 80-year-old retired beer and wine 
wholesaler who heads an organization called Peace Without Violence 
and has close ties to Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Koprivica's group was invited to Yugoslavia by the Serbian  
Orthodox Church and the interview with Milosevic was brokered by 
peace groups, said Mary Paich, secretary of Peace Without Violence. 
</P>
<P>
	KHOU might not have accepted the interview if Hatchett's  
questions were censored, Devlin said. In his first question to 
Milosevic, Hatchett noted that President Clinton has compared the 
Yugoslav leader to Hitler and called him the butcher of the 
Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who are you really?'' Hatchett asked. ``Who are you as a  
person?'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the interview, Milosevic pledged that the three captured  
American soldiers would be well treated and that the Red Cross 
could visit them. The interview was filmed by a crew attached to 
the Serbian government. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers expect TV news organizations to be independent and these  
arrangements could put credibility at risk, said Ed Turner, a 
former CNN executive and fellow at the Media Studies Center of The 
Freedom Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	But if it's explained to viewers, it shouldn't be a problem, he  
said. KHOU has repeatedly said on the air that Hatchett was invited 
to Yugoslavia by pro-Serb forces and told viewers who paid for his 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Devlin suggested that people are criticizing KHOU's interview  
because they can't understand how a local TV station could 
outmaneuver the networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like, `You guys cover your car wrecks and your chemical  
leaks and let the big boys do this,''' he said. ``When somebody 
comes out of the blue and gets this tape it's like, `How dare you 
do that?''' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS used portions of the interview on the ``CBS Evening News''  
Wednesday and ``This Morning'' on Thursday. The network had 
reviewed the transcript and found that the interview was ``pretty 
straightforward,'' spokeswoman Sandra Genelius said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS had sent Rather to Belgrade last week and hoped he would  
interview Milosevic. Paich said Rather had asked for her 
organization's help in trying to arrange the interview and said if 
the network anchorman had been able to stay a few days longer, he 
might have gotten it. 
</P>
<P>
	Koprivica told The Associated Press that he hoped for a  
diplomatic end to the crisis and the safe return of the three 
captured Americans. But he called reports of ethnic cleansing ``a 
lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I know about the Serbs, they have never attacked  
anybody,'' he said. ``They only fight in defense.''

<HEADLINE> Strains With Russia Deeply Rooted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``A new cold war?'' asked The Economist, the  
respected British newsmagazine. The catchy headline probably 
overstates the case, yet the Western rift with Russia is very real. 
</P>
<P>
	Rooted in NATO's expansion, airstrikes on Serbs in Bosnia and,  
before that, the war with Iraq, the divide with Moscow is growing 
wider as the allies pummel the Serbs in Yugoslavia, Russia's 
Orthodox cousins. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is boycotting the NATO summit and Russian diplomats are  
doing their best to portray Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
as a leader with whom the allies can do business. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO leaders give due deference to Russia 's ``important role''  
in solving the Kosovo conflict, but say diplomacy is not providing 
a solution. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the summit, Viktor Chernomyrdin, the former prime  
minister who is Russia's mediator on Kosovo, said Milosevic was 
willing to accept a U.N. ``international presence'' to solve the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	But NATO stood firm Friday, rejecting the Moscow-orchestrated  
overture and insisting that Milosevic withdraw his troops from the 
embattled province. 
</P>
<P>
	As relations with Russia grow chillier, some analysts see a  
danger of a new anti-Western coalition taking form with Moscow at 
its center. 
</P>
<P>
	Dimitri Simes, president of the private Nixon Center, calls the  
rift with Russia ``the most serious event since the end of the Cold 
War, with far-reaching consequences for the U.S.-Russian 
relationship, for the international environment, for American 
foreign policy interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurgeon Keeny, president of the Arms Control Association, is  
concerned that the rift could doom ratification of the 
already-troubled 1993 START II treaty that promised sharp 
reductions in U.S. and Russian long-range nuclear arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless there is an early resolution to the Kosovo crisis  
involving the Russians and the United Nations in a central role 
there is a serious danger that we will not only not make progress 
but lose much that has already been accomplished in arms control,'' 
Keeny said. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been some saber-rattling in Russia in recent weeks --  
notably a suggestion, quickly withdrawn, that President Boris 
Yeltsin might once again target Russian missiles at NATO nations. 
In a nod to reality, Yeltsin was quoted as saying, ``We cannot 
break off relations with leading world powers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helmut Sonnenfeldt, of the Brookings Institution, says the gulf  
is based on ``over-expectations'' that Russia and its leaders could 
cast aside their Soviet experiences and make a rapid transition to 
democracy and a free market system. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the transition, the Russians, pursuing their own  
economic interests in the Persian Gulf, were at cross purposes with 
the United States over Iraq's incursion into oil-rich Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	Now-Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who had forged close ties  
with radical Arab governments, counseled delay in attacking Iraq 
with the argument that diplomacy needed more time. His mission to 
Baghdad failed, and the U.S.-led coalition in 1991 drove Iraq out 
of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians then carried their campaign for diplomatic  
overtures to the long ethnic war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, objecting 
to the allied bombing raids of the Serbs in 1995 that led to the 
Dayton peace accords. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's expansion eastward, incorporating Poland, Hungary and the  
Czech Republic, all former Soviet allies, threw the Russians into a 
fury. 
</P>
<P>
	Many prominent American analysts and retired diplomats objected  
as well, saying NATO was undercutting Yeltsin and others in Moscow 
whose ties to the West were under attack from ardent nationalists 
and Communists. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration policy-makers are not inclined to minimize the  
disagreements, nor Russia's feeling of isolation. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has stressed the pursuit  
of ``shared goals'' with Russia. Moscow still looks to the United 
States for economic support. And even after Primakov dramatically 
canceled talks in Washington last month, he directed Russian 
negotiators to work on cooperative deals. One result was a quiet 
agreement, complete with champagne and toasts, to salvage a uranium 
pact that provides Russia with $12 billion over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Russia has sent an intelligence-gathering ship  
to the Adriatic, suspended its links to NATO, and, led by Yeltsin, 
fired off volleys of harsh rhetoric against the United States and 
the allies. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's future appears inextricably linked to the West. Moscow  
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a leading candidate to succeed Yeltsin, said 
NATO is provoking Russia, but he pledged ``the new democratic 
Russia will not reinstate the Iron Curtain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And yet defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told a military academy  
in Belarus that Russia's nuclear forces would have to be maintained 
at the ``highest level'' of readiness. 
</P>

	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- For three days, they were united in

Sharks return to the ice as competitors to start their playoff 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	The series was supposed to open with games Wednesday and

community mourned the shooting deaths of 15 people at suburban 
Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	The series now will begin with games Saturday and Monday nights  
in San Jose, then move back to Colorado.

<P>
	``Since this tragedy, I'm having a hard time being a hockey  
coach. I'm a dad, I'm an adult,'' Avalanche coach Bob Hartley said. 
``It's real sad. But on the other hand, we're professionals and 
when the pucks drops on Saturday, we have to focus on our jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players on both teams agreed with the decision to postpone the  
first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our way to pay respect to the families and hope for the  
best for the kids that they can get the help that they need and the 
families get the help they need to get over this,'' said Sharks 
forward Mike Ricci, who played for the Avalanche for parts of three 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharks coach Darryl Sutter, the father of a teen-ager, said  
moving the first two games from Denver was ``absolutely the right 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to even talk about it. You can't even begin to deal  
with it,'' Sutter said. ``Bottom line, it's the right decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players said they were not concerned about being rusty after  
going seven days without a game, and felt they will be able to 
focus on Game 1. Colorado defenseman Sylvain Lefebvre said the past 
few days may have brought the Avalanche closer as a team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people have come together. You see it in the whole  
community. You saw people giving blood, there were four-hour lines. 
As a team I think we have to take that as an example,'' he said. 
``Maybe it's good that we're playing in San Jose first. We have to 
go there and play our hearts out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharks general manager Dean Lombardi said the compressed series  
schedule could hurt the winning team in the next round, especially 
if the series goes to seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	But players and team officials said they did not think any team  
would necessarily have an advantage because of the games being 
moved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it will matter. It might be good for us to start  
on the road because of what happened here. It might be good for us 
to go down there and focus on the game,'' Colorado forward Peter 
Forsberg said. ``I don't know who is going to benefit. It doesn't 
hurt having to wait two more days. It's our job. We have to be 
ready and focused when the puck drops, whenever it is.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Manager on Hot Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles have the third-highest  
payroll in baseball. They also have the worst ERA in the majors 
and, most significantly, the worst record. 
</P>
<P>
	If things don't change in a hurry, they may soon have a new  
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	It's hard to blame Ray Miller for the team's 6.73 ERA or the  
fact that Baltimore has stranded an average of nine runners per 
game, most in the majors. Truth is, Miller is probably taking the 
losing harder than anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the fans are not happy but there's no one in the world  
who's less happy than I am right now,'' he said Friday before the 
Orioles were to open a 12-game homestand against the Oakland 
Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bad about the situation, but I'm going to stand behind  
this team. We have plenty enough talent to win,'' Miller insisted. 
``We've all been pressing a little bit. I think if we can get it 
straightened out here, everyone will start feeling all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-12 start is second-worst in franchise history behind the  
0-21 start of the 1988 team. Manager Cal Ripken Sr. was fired six 
games into that season, and his ouster didn't prevent Baltimore 
from losing 107 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's right for the manager to take the heat,''  
catcher Lenny Webster said. ``I truly believe a manager is as good 
as his players. We're not playing good, so we're not making Ray 
look good. We reel off a good winning streak and Ray is going to 
look like a genius.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles went 79-83 under Miller last year, and at this rate  
won't even match that record despite a $78.5 million payroll that 
is exceeded only by the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	After going 1-8 on their recent road trip, the Orioles hope to  
turn things around during a homestand against four teams that 
failed to finish above .500 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You start all over today,'' said first baseman Will Clark, who  
is on the disabled list with a broken thumb. ``You can't dwell on 
what's happened in the past and you can't sit here and feel sorry 
for yourself. You have to come out fighting today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, Cal Ripken and Scott Kamieniecki are all on the disabled  
list, which isn't helping matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless, the Orioles have had difficulty getting their  
pitching and hitting working in unison. They scored at least six 
runs on five occasions but won only two of those games; they 
allowed only four hits Thursday night but got only one hit 
themselves in a 1-0 loss to Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're in a bad stretch everything is magnified,'' second  
baseman Jeff Reboulet said. ``Right now it's one thing or another. 
Nothing seems to be going right. But we've got a lot of time to 
catch up. It's too early to give up on the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller isn't giving up either, even though dozens of callers on  
local talk shows have been demanding his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry about anybody second-guessing me,'' Miller said.  
``I'm just going to try and do my job as best I can.''

<HEADLINE> Abitibi Cuts 1,300 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Abitibi-Consolidated Inc., the world's No. 1  
newsprint producer, announced Thursday a restructuring that 
includes eliminating up to 1,300 jobs, or 10 percent of its work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring is expected to save the company approximately  
$68 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	A plan to lay off or encourage the retirement of about 900  
workers at four pulp and paper mills by the end of next year is 
already under way, said spokeswoman Susan Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the company expects to let go of as many as 400  
additional workers ``in due course'' at its head office and other 
mills, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs are the result of modernizating machinery, a glut in  
paper production and duplication created by the 1997 merger between 
Abitibi-Price and Stone-Consolidated. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced $62 million in restructuring costs that  
will affect first quarter earnings. Two thirds of that charge, 
$40.6 million, is due to funding for pension plans for workers who 
agree to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Abitibi-Consolidated said it expects to report  
first quarter earnings that are in line with analysts' 
expectations. The company said earnings from continuing operations 
will be approximately $6.1 million, or 3 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Abitibi-Consolidated, based in Montreal, was created in 1997 by  
the merger of Abitibi-Price Inc. and Stone-Consolidated Corp. The 
company operates 19 mills throughout North America and Britain and 
had a net loss in 1998 $23.3 million on sales of $2.2 billion.

<HEADLINE> Colo. School Victim Leaves Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Makai Hall is in a wheelchair for now, recovering  
from a bullet wound that shattered his right knee when two of his 
classmates opened fire on him. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim in Tuesday's massacre at Columbine High School was  
released from St. Anthony Central Hospital on Friday, saying he was 
ready to move on with his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want people to know I'm getting better and a lot of my  
healing's been done,'' the 16-year-old student told reporters. 
``Even though it's a great tragedy, I'm not going to let it bring 
me down. I'm going to use it to motivate myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall was in the library, where most of the fatal shootings  
happened, when a teacher ran screaming down the hall that some kids 
had guns. He hid under a desk. Dylan Klebold and fellow shooter 
Eric Harris entered, and started shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``They fired a number of shots and one hit me and I lay on the  
ground. They moved towards me and that's all I can remember,'' Hall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall was credited with saving some lives when he tossed an  
explosive away from a group of injured students. He did not appear 
eager to be called a hero. 
</P>
<P>
	``I threw it away from us,'' the dark-haired teen said, his eyes  
cast downward. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall spoke to reporters just before he was discharged from the  
hospital. A blue and white ribbon was pinned to his green sweater. 
An injury was visible on the left side of his jaw where he had been 
hit with shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said he had been in a French class with Klebold and  
described him as an ``all right guy. ... He never treated me bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen people died, including the shooters, and 23 were injured  
Tuesday. When asked if he was ready to return to school he 
shrugged, ``I don't want to answer that.''

<HEADLINE> Rockets Star Pippen Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Scottie Pippen denies being drunk when police  
pulled him over for running a red light. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not intoxicated when arrested after the game last night  
and I'm confident the evidence will support me in the end,'' Pippen 
said in a statement issued by his agent after his arrest early 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer who stopped Pippen around 1:30 a.m. said the NBA  
star ran a red light. A member of the department's DWI task force 
was called after suspecting Pippen was intoxicated, police 
spokesman Fred King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, 33, did poorly on the field sobriety test and was taken  
into custody, where he was videotaped and given the opportunity to 
take a Breathalyzer test, King said. 
</P>
<P>
	After he refused the Breathalyzer, Pippen was booked on  
suspicion of DWI and released on $500 bond just before 7 a.m. His 
arraignment is set for next Thursday before Harris County 
Court-at-Law Judge Sherman Ross. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen has not formally hired a lawyer, but Houston lawyer Rusty  
Hardin said he is set to meet with Pippen next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates supported Pippen during a brief practice Thursday  
before flying to Los Angeles for a game with the Clippers tonight. 
Pippen didn't attend the workout, but coach Rudy Tomjanovich said 
he would accompany the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping it won't be a distraction,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We  
are trying not to make any assumptions. It would be unfair to 
comment when nothing has been established. I'm sort of used to 
unexpected things happening. You just try not to lose your 
composure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston, currently fourth in the Western Conference playoff  
race, was upset by the Dallas Mavericks 109-95 Wednesday night, 
keeping the Rockets from clinching a spot in the playoffs and 
snapping Dallas' 11-game losing streak against the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen had four points and three rebounds and was repeatedly  
beaten defensively. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scottie is my teammate and I'm behind him 100 percent,''  
Charles Barkley said. ``This is not Armageddon. It happened. 
Scottie Pippen probably wasn't the only person stopped last night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scottie Pippen is a role model. If all the kids grew up to be  
like Scottie, the world would be a better place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen has struggled to fit into the Rockets' alignment after  
earning seven NBA All-Star appearances and helping the Chicago 
Bulls win six NBA championships. He broke out with a season-high 31 
points on April 15 against Portland and had 22 points and 11 
rebounds in a victory over Seattle on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Pippen was traded from the Bulls, with whom he had  
spent his 11-year pro career, and signed a five-year, $67.2 million 
contract with the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, slowed by back and hand injuries, still hasn't missed a  
game. He is averaging 14 points and six rebounds, both below his 
career norms, and his six assists per game is slightly better.

<HEADLINE> Group Pushes for Meat Irradiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal proposal to allow irradiation of  
uncooked meats should be expanded to include ready-to-eat products 
like hot dogs and luncheon meats, a quasi-governmental group of 
food safety experts said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a clear benefit for irradiation of ready-to-eat meat  
products,'' said Dennis Olson, director of the Utilization Center 
for Agricultural Products at Iowa State University, citing the 
numerous recalls of contaminated ready-to-eat products. Olson is 
part of the Food Safety Consortium, established by Congress in 1988 
at the University of Arkansas, Iowa State University and Kansas 
State University to investigate meat and food safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Several companies have been forced to recall their luncheon  
meats and hot dogs in recent months due to possible contamination 
by Listeria monocytogenes bacteria. In December, Zeeland, 
Mich.-based Bil Mar Foods had to recall 15 million pounds of hot 
dogs and lunch meats after Listeria-contaminated products from the 
plant were linked to 100 illnesses in 22 states, as well as 15 
deaths and six miscarriages or stillbirths. 
</P>
<P>
	``Irradiating those products may have helped prevent illnesses  
associated with some of those products,'' Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Olson and others representing the consortium said irradiation  
would provide ``an additional layer of safety'' for precooked 
foods. The current Agriculture Department proposal would permit -- 
but not require -- irradiation only for refrigerated or frozen 
uncooked meat. 
</P>
<P>
	During irradiation, low-level doses of gamma rays or electron  
beam irradiation are administered to kill bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA is accepting public comment on the proposal before issuing  
its final rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can no longer ignore the food safety benefits irradiation  
provides,'' said Dr. Richard Hunter, deputy state health officer 
for the Florida Department of Health. ``The federal government 
needs to be more active and dedicate more resources to educating 
the public about the benefits and safety of irradiation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Food Processors Association is preparing to  
petition the federal government to expand the proposed irradiation 
rule to include precooked meats, said spokesman Tim Willard. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would obviously be strong consumer benefits to making  
this technology available,'' Willard said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Securities Firms Post Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's three largest securities companies suffered  
record losses for the latest fiscal year because of global market 
turmoil and restructuring costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomura Securities Co. recorded a loss of 397.54 billion yen, or  
$3.3 billion, versus a profit of 76.32 billion yen a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Daiwa Securities Co and Nikko Securities Co. said Friday their  
losses widened in the fiscal year ended March 31 compared to the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Daiwa Securities lost 127.89 billion yen, or $1.07 billion,  
compared with a loss of 83.66 billion yen for the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nikko Securities' group net loss surged to 177.49 billion yen,  
or $1.48 billion, from 71 billion yen a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the recent stock market recovery was likely to  
help brokerages but warned that they also will need to deal with 
increasing competition after Japan's recent financial deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 1.54 percent  
on Friday, closing at 16,923.25, boosted by growing hopes for more 
government measures to stimulate the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as trading in the stock market remains active, the  
securities companies can expect large profit growth this fiscal 
year,'' said Hideyasu Ban, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. ``But it 
is still uncertain whether the growth will be sustainable in the 
long term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All three companies were hurt by losses at affiliates or by  
costs from restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomura had to inject money into its troubled domestic non-bank  
unit, Nomura Finance Co., and its U.S. business posted losses 
because of the market turmoil in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	A Nomura official said that the company would probably boost  
profitability in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Daiwa's losses resulted from additional financial aid to a  
non-bank affiliate, losses on Russian bond trading and the fallout 
from economic turmoil in other emerging markets. A drastic 
restructuring of its overseas operations also hurt, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Nikko official said his company aims to return to  
profitability this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Warburg Dillon Read's Ayako Sato urged caution.  
</P>
<P>
	``Brokerage share prices have begun to factor in a market  
recovery, but it is too early to expect them to reflect stronger 
earnings,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Hyundai To Pare Number of Divisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Under government pressure, heavily  
indebted Hyundai Group plans to reduce the number of its 
subsidiaries to 26 from 79 by 2003 through sales and mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest conglomerate said it would concentrate on  
five key sectors -- automobiles, shipbuilding, 
construction-engineering, electronics and finance. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai officials said today the conglomerate will eventually be  
broken into five groups to handle each of the core businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai, along with another conglomerate, Daewoo, has been under  
mounting government pressure to trim its business portfolio and 
narrow its focus. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo, the nation's second largest conglomerate, unveiled plans  
earlier this week to sell its shipbuilding and 25 other 
subsidiaries by October to improve its financial position and focus 
on carmaking and finance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The restructuring will completely change the face of  
Hyundai,'' Park Se-yong, head of the group's corporate 
restructuring committee, told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Also announced at the news conference was the conclusion of a  
deal that allows Hyundai to buy a computer memory chip-making arm 
of LG group for $2.13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, wrapped up late Thursday after months of negotiations,  
calls for Hyundai to pay LG Semicon $1.3 billion immediately and 
the remainder in five installments by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition will make Hyundai Electronics Co. the world's  
largest memory chip producer with an estimated 20.8 percent share 
of the world market. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai officials said the restructuring aims to reduce their  
group's total debt to $2.7 billion from $6.5 billion by the end of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of Hyundai subsidiaries to be sold, spun off or merged  
includes several profitable steel making, petrochemical and 
aluminum plants as well as smaller plants. 
</P>
<P>
	As in the case of Daewoo, Hyundai's plan drew applause from the  
government but skepticism from economists and analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts expressed doubt that Hyundai will be able to find  
buyers for its assets. They noted that most past promises by the 
nation's top conglomerates went unfulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of restructuring by Hyundai and Daewoo came  
days after President Kim Dae-jung urged vigorous corporate 
restructuring to improve efficiency and boost foreign investors' 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has focused his criticism on the country's top  
five conglomerates -- Daewoo, Hyundai, Samsung, LG and SK -- each of 
which controls 40 to 70 subsidiaries, making everything from 
computer chips to cars and ships. 
</P>
<P>
	When the economy slowed in 1996-1997, about a dozen  
conglomerates collapsed under their debt load, leaving banks with 
mounds of non-performing loans that caused a sudden loss of 
confidence and triggered a flight of foreign capital. 
</P>
<P>
	That forced South Korea to accept a record $58 billion bailout  
from the International Monetary Fund in late 1997. Structural 
economic reforms were a key condition of the rescue package. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Korean economy shrank 5.8 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Dr. Says Yeltsin Healthy Enough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Boris Yeltsin is in relatively good health but  
might be faking illness to lull his political foes into a false 
sense of security, his chief doctor said in an interview published 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian president's health ``allows him to run again in  
2000'' for the presidency, Sergei Mironov said in the daily 
Komsomolskaya Pravda. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Russia's highest court ruled in November that Yeltsin  
cannot seek a third presidential term in 2000 because he already 
has been elected twice, the constitutional limit, and Yeltsin 
himself has insisted that he does not intend to seek re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks by Mironov, Yeltsin's close confidant for many  
years, appeared aimed at the Communists and other hard-liners in 
parliament's lower house, who have said Yeltsin is too sick to lead 
Russia and are set to hold an impeachment debate against him in 
mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	Mironov warned the president's political rivals against  
``prematurely writing off'' Yeltsin. He even suggested that the 
president had feigned some of his illnesses to mislead his 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can't you admit that he may conceal his true condition from  
opponents?'' Mironov asked. ``Those cautious people who say that 
Boris Nikolayevich (Yeltsin) will catch cold at our funerals are 
right. There is reason in this saying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A number of illnesses -- from heart attacks to pneumonia to an  
ulcer -- have left Yeltsin hospitalized for weeks at a time in the 
last few years, turning him into a part-time president. With his 
grip on power weakened, his foes have stepped up efforts to oust 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Mironov sought to downplay the seriousness of heart attacks that  
led to Yeltsin's quintuple bypass surgery in 1996. But he did 
express concern about Yeltsin's recent history of respiratory 
illnesses, which can cause fatigue, ``bad sleep and, sometimes, an 
inability to concentrate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite those problems and his recent hospitalization for a  
bleeding ulcer, Yeltsin, 68, remains strong, Mironov argued. 
</P>
<P>
	``He works up to 12 hours on some days ... and four or five  
hours of rest are enough for him, although we believe he should 
sleep longer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mironov denied that Yeltsin's alleged love for vodka had eroded  
his health, but didn't deny that the president had an occasional 
drink. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since old times, vodka has been an important stress-relieving  
medicine, and the head of state's job is very stressful,'' he said. 
``I haven't seen any alcohol abuse, and, correspondingly, Boris 
Nikolayevich has had no alcohol-related health problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said details of Yeltsin's medical history were in great  
demand by the president's foes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no secret that they have offered big money for Yeltsin's  
health record -- millions of dollars,'' Mironov said without 
elaborating.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Track Stars Look For Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Track and field's top stars Michael Johnson  
and Marion Jones are competing at the Penn Relays -- the 
best-attended meet in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, the world No. 1 in the 100- and 200-meter races and in  
the long jump, relishes the few opportunities she has to show off 
her talents without leaving the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not too often as American athletes, we can stay home and  
go to a track meet,'' Jones said Friday, one day before she and her 
Nike teammates were to compete in the 105th running of the Penn 
Relays. ``We love to compete in front of all the people and the 
Penn Relays is definitely a highlight for me and I'm sure probably 
for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, track and field is not a highlight for American sports  
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The sport appeared to receive a kick start just two years ago  
during the Atlanta Olympics, but much to the dismay of its 
athletes, since then, interest has steadily declined. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know growing up, watching the Penn Relays on television was  
a highlight, to see the young kids competing '' said Jones, a 
native of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the opportunity to see this event will be limited to  
those in attendance as no part of the three-day meet will be 
televised. The final day of competition at the Penn Relays often 
attracts crowds upwards of 40,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's the greatest track meet in America,'' said  
Johnson who is scheduled to run along with another world champion 
Maurice Greene in the 800 relay. ``It's always just a great crowd, 
a knowledgeable crowd about track and field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just fun to be able to walk into a stadium here in  
America for a track meet and see that many people in the stands. 
It's a great feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Greene, although the top runners come from the  
United States, there aren't enough chances to show the home folks 
how good they are. 
</P>
<P>
	``Give us the stages to run, and let us do our jobs,'' he said.  
``If they give us places to run and put out what we need to have a 
good meet, we'll do our jobs. It's up to us to bring in the fan 
base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson recognizes what the tradition of the Penn Relays means  
to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have people who have planned their schedules in the spring  
around the Penn Relays, so it's very important,'' Johnson said. 
``It's a very significant stop on the American circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The popularity of track around the world makes these stars more  
famous elsewhere, compared to at home where they can go virtually 
unrecognized. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more we're seen, the more we're known,'' Greene said.  
``We're seen all the time in Europe, that's why we're so well 
known.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Resolves To Continue Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Western leaders, celebrating NATO's 50th  
anniversary, pledged today to intensify their military fight 
against Yugoslavia and maintain it until their demands are met. 
``We will not allow this campaign of terror to succeed. NATO is 
determined to prevail,'' the alliance's 19 partners declared. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement, issued at the conclusion of a three-hour session  
that dealt exclusively with the crisis in Kosovo, said the bombing, 
now in its fifth week, would end if Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic ends his crackdown in the province and meets other NATO 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, at a ceremony commemorating the April 1949  
signing of the charter setting up the Cold War alliance that 
confronted Soviet power in Europe, described Milosevic's regime as 
``the last European dictatorship of the 20th century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The alliance will not have meaning in the 21st century if it  
permits the slaughter of innocents on its doorsteps,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can be no compromise on these conditions,'' the joint  
statement said. The demands include a withdrawal of Serbian forces 
from Kosovo, an armed international peacekeeping force and a 
settlement that would restore autonomy to ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement also called for an oil embargo against Yugoslavia  
-- although it did not specify how it would be carried out -- and 
said NATO would seek a U.N. Security Council resolution supporting 
demilitarization of Kosovo and an international peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-page statement did not mention the possibility of  
sending ground troops into the battle -- a subject on which alliance 
leaders are divided. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the military offensive  
against Belgrade shows ``values have meaning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solana welcomed into the alliance three former Warsaw Pact  
nations -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Poland's president, Aleksander Kwasiniewski, told the gathering,  
``The dreams of our fathers and grandfathers have now come true. 
... The doors to NATO must stay open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Balkans crisis brings with NATO membership ``not only a  
feeling of comfort, it is also about shared responsibility,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders, each standing by his national flag, signed a  
commemorative copy of the 1949 treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit brought 42 heads of government to town -- the 19 NATO  
leaders and leaders of 23 partner states. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking a U.N. Security Council resolution to force a settlement  
on Milosevic likely would set up a confrontation with Russia, which 
has veto power in the Security Council and opposes the bombing. The 
leaders said Russia has ``an important role to play in a search for 
a solution to the conflict in Kosovo'' and said they want to work 
constructively with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO announced it would enforce economic sanctions more  
forcefully -- and called for ``an embargo on petroleum products.'' 
It directed defense ministers to develop a way to keep seaborne oil 
from reaching Yugoslavia. The United States has proposed boarding 
and searching ships in the Adriatic suspected of supplying oil to 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is prepared to suspend its airstrikes once Belgrade has  
unequivocally accepted the ... conditions and demonstrably begun to 
withdraw its forces from Kosovo, according to precise and rapid 
timetable,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Western leaders rejected a new diplomatic  
overture from Milosevic to end the bombing, NATO's first-ever 
military offensive against a sovereign nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The overture did not meet two key demands -- removal of  
Milosevic's forces from the Serbian province and emplacement of an 
armed international peacekeeping force, leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, suggested that Milosevic  
might agree to an armed force in Kosovo under certain 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	But Western leaders still rejected the overture. French  
President Jacques Chirac called it ``totally insufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic must know there is no place for his policies in  
Europe on the eve of the 21st century,'' Solana said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting under extraordinary security, with several blocks  
surrounding the ornate Reagan Building sealed off and helicopters 
hovering overhead, NATO leaders had been expected to debate the 
issue of ground troops at their meeting, although no decision had 
been expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme commander for Europe, told the  
closed-door gathering on Kosovo, ``We are winning. He (Milosevic) 
is losing. And he knows it,'' according to a U.S. official who was 
in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders' statement declares that NATO won't accept any  
threat against neighboring countries and expresses support for the 
government of Montenegro, Yugoslavia's smaller, pro-Western 
republic, saying any attempt to undermine that government would 
have grave consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as NATO leaders met, the air campaign against Yugoslavia  
continued without pause. The headquarters of Belgrade's main 
television network was hit, and NATO destroyed one of Milosevic's 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that damage continues,'' British Prime  
Minister Tony Blair said this morning on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton earlier bestowed his support on Solana's decision to  
have NATO military leaders update contingency plans for Yugoslavia, 
including one for a possible ground assault. The president called 
it ``a wise and prudent course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all NATO leaders were comfortable with the progress of the  
air war. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said prolonged bombing of  
Yugoslavia could turn his nation against NATO and the United 
States. While sticking to Greece's official support, Simitis said: 
``The more the war continues, the more difficult the problems will 
be.''

<HEADLINE> Seven Dead in Army Helicopter Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) -- Army investigators today examined  
wreckage from a Black Hawk helicopter that went down during a 
training mission, killing seven soldiers and injuring the other 
four aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigators were trying to learn why the UH-60L helicopter  
went down Thursday at Fort Campbell, a sprawling base on the 
Kentucky-Tennessee line that serves as headquarters for the Army's 
101st Airborne Division. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have an accident of this nature is very traumatic, and our  
hearts and prayers go out to the families of the fatalities,'' said 
Army spokesman George Heath. 
</P>
<P>
	Three soldiers were transported to Vanderbilt University Medical  
Center in Nashville, Tenn., where one died. The other two soldiers 
were initially listed in critical but stable condition, but one was 
downgraded to critical today, hospital spokesman Matt Scanlan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more soldiers were listed in stable condition at Blanchfield  
Army Community Hospital at Fort Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	An Army photo of the crash scene showed the helicopter scattered  
in several large pieces in a wooded area beside a road. The Black 
Hawk broke up after a ``traumatic impact with the ground,'' Heath 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation team from the Army Safety Center at Fort  
Rucker, Ala., arrived at Fort Campbell on Thursday in an effort to 
find the cause of the crash, the deadliest at the base since two 
helicopters collided in 1988 and killed 17 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The Black Hawk is the primary helicopter for air assault, air  
cavalry and medical evacuation units. The soldiers were practicing 
either getting on or off the helicopter when it crashed, Heath 
said, adding that training missions often involve a degree of 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``We owe it to our soldiers, the sons and daughters of the  
American people, to place them in a training environment that would 
give them a surviving chance in a hostile environment,'' he said. 
``That's what we train for.''

<HEADLINE> Two Americans Tie for Rolex Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Karen O'Connor and her horse, Prince  
Panache, were tied with Gayle Molander and her mount, Sir Nicholas, 
after Friday's first day of four-star competition in the Rolex 
Kentucky Three-Day Event. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor, of The Plains, Va., and Molander, of Upperco, Md.,  
each finished their dressage tests with 63 penalty points. Reigning 
world champion Blyth Tait of New Zealand, the 1996 Olympic 
individual gold medalist, was third with 70 penalty points. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Todd of New Zealand and Bruce Davidson of Unionville, Pa.,  
tied for fourth with 71. 
</P>
<P>
	The competition at the Kentucky Horse Park continues with  
cross-country tests on Saturday and jumping on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Four-star events represent the elite level of equestrian  
competition. Only four annual competitions are given that 
designation, with the Rolex Three-Day the lone such event in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A win for Tait in the Rolex Three-Day would give him a shot at a  
$250,000 prize being offered to any rider who wins the Rolex, 
Badminton and Burghley four-star events in succession. Tait won the 
Burghley title in Britain last fall; the Badminton event will be 
held in Britain in May. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-star event is being held in conjunction with the  
four-star competition. The former continues Saturday with the 
cross-country phase. 
</P>
<P>
	Linden Wiesman of Bluemont, Va., and her horse, Dutch Delph,  
were the leaders in the three-star competition following the 
dressage phase, held Wednesday and Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Politics Hamper Big Telecom Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Obstacles keep popping up to the proposed merger  
of the German and Italian telecommunications titans. Analysts say 
that if the deal between Deutsche Telecom and Telecom Italia goes 
through, the companies will face cultural differences, an unwieldy 
management structure and skeptical investors. 
</P>
<P>
	But first, the planned $80 billion combination must overcome  
challenges that could keep it from happening. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian ministers are turning up the heat on the German  
government to guarantee it will slash its majority stake in 
Deutsche Telekom. And France Telecom is making waves about the 
expansion plans of its longtime partner in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	One day after Telecom Italia and Deutsche Telekom disclosed  
details of the largest merger ever attempted in Europe, the deal's 
prospects seemed very much in question Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say it's a 50-50 chance,'' said Robin Bosworth of  
Schema Ltd., a London-based consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian officials from the prime minister on down have expressed  
hope that Telecom Italia, a former state-owned monopoly, will 
remain in Italian hands. Of particular concern is the German 
government's 72 percent stake in Deutsche Telekom. 
</P>
<P>
	The German Finance Ministry last week assured the Italian  
Treasury that it would not interfere with the merged company's 
operations and structure, but the Italians are unconvinced. Italy's 
Finance Minister Vincenzo Visco insisted Friday that the German 
government guarantee that it will reduce its stake -- and share 
control of the new company on an equal basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the merger agreement, Deutsche Telekom would control about  
56 percent of the new company, and the German government would own 
40 percent of its stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian Communications Minister Salvatore Cardinale said the  
Germans must give ``clear, precise and rapid signals'' about when 
it will sell off its stake in Deutsche Telekom and how the two 
governments will share equal control of the new business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that the Italians are being unreasonable,'' said  
Robert Grindle, an industry analyst at HSBC in London. ``They are 
in an unequal position because they've been more progressive in 
privatizing the former state-owned phone company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian government owns just 3.4 percent of Telecom Italia,  
although it has veto power over major decisions like mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	A rival bid for Telecom Italia by its smaller Italian rival,  
Olivetti, is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The German-Italian merger has already angered one of Deutsche  
Telekom's oldest partners, France Telecom. The French company has 
accused Deutsche Telekom of violating its previous commitments and 
said it will take action to protect its shareholders' interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom have reciprocal 2 percent  
shareholdings, and together with Sprint Corp. of the United States, 
they own the Global One joint telecom venture. 
</P>
<P>
	London-based analyst Bosworth said France Telecom poses a  
diplomatic challenge for the German company because their 
partnership was born in part out of a desire by politicians to form 
a strong Franco-German business relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia chief executive Franco Bernabe and his German  
counterpart Ron Sommer have played down the potential difficulties 
of the merger. The co-chiefs of the new company seem to have a good 
personal chemistry, but they are planning on a kind of dual 
management that has a poor record of success elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernabe and Sommer will need to make tough choices about where  
to cut costs and invest -- decisions that will be of great interest 
to their respective governments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would make more operational and commercial sense to have a  
single chief in the long run,'' Bosworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders in the merger partners have been unenthused.  
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, Deutsche Telekom's shares fell 2.2 percent after the  
deal was unveiled Thursday and dropped another 0.3 percent on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia fell 1.3 percent on Thursday, but bounced back  
1.6 percent Friday as some bet that the deal might fall through. 
Olivetti shares have been rising.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Eyed as Way To Pay Lawyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Lawyers involved in the national tobacco  
settlement who could wait for years to collect billions of dollars 
in fees are trying to find a way to get their money faster. One 
possible solution: issuing bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's certainly being looked at by people as an  
alternative,'' said attorney Joe Rice, whose Charleston, S.C., firm 
Ness Motley Loadholt Richardson &AMP; Poole is among those exploring 
the idea. ``Maybe not a good one yet, but we're looking at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the key questions is whether investors will bite --  
particularly since the tobacco companies' continued financial 
health will be key to the bondholders making any money on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigarette makers are required to pay attorneys' fees as part of  
the landmark $206 billion settlement with 46 states and five 
territoriesover smoking-related health care costs. The companies 
must pay $500 million annually until the fees are paid off, meaning 
some lawyers will wait years before being paid in full. 
</P>
<P>
	In three states -- Florida, Mississippi and Texas -- lawyers have  
been awarded $8.2 billion in fees by arbitrators. With $500 million 
paid each year, it will be about 16 years before those lawyers get 
their full fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The fees for attorneys in other states have not yet been set.  
Many of the lawyers are also likely to choose arbitration to 
determine how much they'll receive, and that means the $500 million 
payments will be stretched over an even longer span of years, said 
San Francisco lawyer Robert Lieff, whose law firm represented 
several states. 
</P>
<P>
	The bonds, which Lieff said would be issued ``by a separate  
entity to be created,'' would be one way for the lawyers to receive 
their money now. The plan also would have tax advantages, and 
protect the attorneys if any of the four tobacco companies that 
signed the agreement go bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that has been done before with plenty of  
other things, but not with attorney's fees,'' Lieff said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea was discussed by a group of about 15 lawyers at a  
meeting several weeks ago in Washington D.C. Since then, said 
Lieff, about 12 investment banking firms have expressed interest in 
underwriting the bonds. The lawyers have given them a Tuesday 
deadline for submitting proposals for a bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``After that, we'll have a better idea whether this is  
feasible,'' Lieff said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, several states and municipalities, including  
Texas and New York City, also are looking into the idea of issuing 
bonds to get money from the settlement more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieff, of the law firm Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann &AMP; Bernstein,  
said the tobacco companies would not have to agree to the bond 
issue, because they have already agreed in the settlement to pay 
the money. The funds paid annually by the industry would back the 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	But some were skeptical of the idea.  
</P>
<P>
	Edward L. Sweda, senior attorney with the Tobacco Products  
Liability Project at the Northeastern University School of Law, 
said there are numerous risks involved, and investment in such 
bonds would certainly be more precarious than, for instance, 
investment in traditional government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are several layers of issues that should be looked at --  
one of them is the reliance on the steady payments in that the 
companies would not go bankrupt, and another is whether the number 
of people who would become smokers would generate the sales that 
would be able to sustain the payments over a number of years,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorneys who helped craft the settlement signed off on the  
delayed payments, so perhaps they will have to live with it, Sweda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suppose maybe someone will invest in these,'' he said. ``But  
my initial gut feeling is that there wouldn't be an overwhelming 
market for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The companies involved in the settlement are Phillip Morris  
Cos., RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., Lorillard Tobacco and Brown &AMP; 
Williamson Tobacco.

	The Wall Street rating firm Standard &AMP; Poor's raised the city's  
bond rating from junk bond status or ``BB'' to ``BBB'' Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rating upgrades are based on the district's improved  
financial and administrative factors,'' said Standard &AMP; Poor's 
analyst Parry Young. He cited the district's ability to post budget 
surpluses during the past two years as one of the ``big drivers'' 
of the ratings upgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big deal,'' said Marilyn Cohen, president of Envision  
Capital Management, who manages bond portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
	The upgrade indicates Wall Street is more confident now that the  
city can pay the principal and interest on its bonds back in a 
timely fashion, Cohen said. That could make a difference when the 
district tries to raise $500 million through bond sales in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors ``who swooped in and bought D.C. bonds when others  
were selling them have made a mint'' off of the new rating, Cohen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The change, which does not affect $1 billion in outstanding  
general obligation debt, is expected to save D.C. taxpayers 
millions of dollars in future transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The revenues that this upgrade will bring can mean lower  
taxes, better services and a greater investment in children and 
youth,'' said Mayor Tony Williams, who along with D.C. Council 
Chairwoman Linda Cropp met earlier this month with Standard &AMP; 
Poor's representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Confidence in the district government's management and  
financial responsibility is growing,'' Cropp said in response to 
the upgrade. ``The city is establishing a track record of balancing 
the budget, improving service delivery and making capital 
improvements.''

<HEADLINE> Ripken Weighs Options </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken isn't quite sure just how serious  
his back injury is, admitting Friday that he might have to go 
beyond cortisone shots to alleviate the pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken never mentioned the word ``retirement'' in his first  
meeting with the media since going on the disabled list Monday. But 
he didn't dismiss that option, either. 
</P>
<P>
	His plan appeared to be to work toward returning to action,  
although he remains unsure as to the best means of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here today to say I'm going to be OK. It's no big issue in  
my whole life,'' he said. ``I have to look hard at my injury 
situation, evaluate that with my whole career, and make decisions 
and judgments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a situation that merits serious consideration. I'm  
weighing a lot of things,'' he added. ``I'm still gathering 
information, so I can't say what it is I'm trying to decide. I'm 
trying to determine what are the options, the possible courses to 
take, and really confirming what the condition is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, 38, played in a major league record 2,632 straight games  
before willingly ending his streak last September. He had never 
before been placed on the disabled list before this week, but 
fought through a herniated disk in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Surgery was never ever suggested then,'' he said. ``Since that  
point, until the day before Opening Day, I haven't had an ounce of 
back pain. So this is not a chronic thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The short-term solution is to receive cortisone shots in his  
lower back. Whether that will provide lasting relief is not known. 
</P>
<P>
	``The easy option was to get a shot that would relieve some of  
the inflammation. That was a no-brainer,'' he said. ``This is a 
situation where I don't have control, I can't go out and will 
myself to do it. It's a situation that needs to be fixed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watching his teammates play has been a unique experience, one he  
has not enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's another issue I'll have to come to grips with. I've  
always been someone to come to the ballpark and want to play,'' he 
said. ``There's a certain sad feeling (when) you're not playing.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Meeting Emotional for Albright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the  
historic moment was personal. 
</P>
<P>
	A uniformed Czech officer bearing the tricolor of his young  
democracy -- the land of Albright's birth -- took his place today in 
the NATO procession of allied flags. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Berlin Wall fell ... and now NATO welcomes Poland, Hungary  
and the Czech Republic,'' an announcer intoned. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright rubbed the arm of Czech Foreign Minister Jan Kavan and  
gave him an emphatic thumbs-up as the two tipped their heads 
together with sentimental smiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Tears rolled down Albright's face.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, 20 NATO leaders made speeches at the ceremony, then  
signed a 50th anniversary ``vision statement'' reaffirming their 
alliance, then sat down. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, that's how it was supposed to go.  
</P>
<P>
	Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, after giving a  
forceful three-minute statement in English without any notes, was 
back at his seat before he remembered about the parchment laid out 
beside 20 neatly aligned, uncapped pens. 
</P>
<P>
	In his haste to recover, the prime minister missed the fancy  
souvenirs and used a ballpoint from his coat pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	Czech President Vaclav Havel, the playwright, also signed with  
his own pen. President Clinton later turned over his own souvenir 
to Havel. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, the 20th signer in  
addition to the leaders of the 19 member nations, drew chuckles 
when he appeared to read the document at length before signing. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The British are finicky about their flag.  
</P>
<P>
	It's a good thing. At a rehearsal for the opening ceremony, the  
British flag was carried in upside-down. It was turned around 
before Friday's parade of brightly colored flags at the ceremonial 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can put the United Kingdom flag upside-down so easily if  
you don't really pay attention to what you're doing,'' says Thomas 
L. Groppel, an American who helped coordinate the procession. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wide white to the top,'' Groppel says. ``Every time the  
Brits go to an event, they'll check their flag out to see if it's 
upside-down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	He dismisses the nickname, but Groppel, director of ceremonies  
and special events for the Military District of Washington, is 
known by some as ``Mr. Flag'' for the NATO event. 
</P>
<P>
	There are flags at luncheons, flags at dinners and flags at  
ceremonies. Foreign leaders are greeted by their country's flag 
when they step off airplanes and at the White House when they 
arrive for dinners. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight complete sets of the 44 flags -- the 19 NATO members and 25  
partner countries -- will be used, Groppel says. That's 352 flags -- 
not to mention the 9-foot, 6-inch flagpoles and bulky 10-pound flag 
stands. Soldiers spent hours at ironing boards taking out wrinkles 
from flags. 
</P>
<P>
	``Flags? Oh, there's where you can get into deep, deep trouble --  
I mean real trouble,'' says Selwa ``Lucky'' Roosevelt, the State 
Department's chief of protocol during the Reagan administration. 
``If you get the wrong flag, that's really embarrassing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And they have to be displayed according to rules of protocol.  
But whose protocol? 
</P>
<P>
	According to NATO, the 19 flags are lined up alphabetically in  
the English language with the blue-and-white NATO flag in the 
middle. For a U.S. event, the ``Star-Spangled Banner'' is on the 
far right and flags of visiting nations are arranged alphabetically 
by their common names. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the Republic of Ireland -- it's Ireland -- 'I' not 'R.'  
It's Germany, not the Federal Republic of Germany -- 'G' not 'F,''' 
Groppel says. 
</P>
<P>
	He adds that it's easy to fly Germany's flag upside-down, too.  
There are three horizontal stripes. The black one goes on top. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	NATO came to town and everybody else stayed home.  
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, traffic jams were predicted; people were urged to  
stay away. Schools were closed. Nearly 100,000 federal employees 
had a ``NATO day off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a ghost town,'' Alpheila Kerns said as she walked to  
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington residents braced themselves for gridlock. There were  
empty streets instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really eerie,'' Janell Bragg said, looking down  
Pennsylvania Avenue as she waited for a cup of coffee at a vending 
cart outside the White House. ``You'd think it was a Sunday.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Rockies Return With Arm Patches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Jay Alves stood behind home plate in the  
stadium that shook violently during the devastating 1989 
earthquake, his thoughts focused on a much more recent tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Alves, public relations director for the Colorado Rockies, lives  
in Littleton, Colo., where two students killed 12 classmates, a 
teacher and themselves at Columbine High School on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, he was with the Rockies in San Francisco as they  
played for the first time since the school shootings. The Rockies, 
who postponed home games Tuesday and Wednesday, played with ``CHS'' 
patches on their right sleeves in memory of the shooting victims. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade ago, Alves was at Candlestick Park as the public  
relations director of the Oakland Athletics as a violent earthquake 
shook northern California and interrupted the 1989 World Series 
against the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a similar feeling to the 1989 earthquake,'' Alves said.  
``It reminds me very much of that time, when people lost their 
lives and baseball didn't feel important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rockies players said they were trying to refocus their thoughts  
on baseball, not on the TV images of their grief-stricken 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been really tough. As a father, I can't imagine what  
those parents are going through. Especially when it's happening in 
your own backyard,'' said relief pitcher Chuck McElroy. ``You still 
have to do your job. But it will always be in our minds, because 
it's like we were there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The postponed games against the Montreal Expos will be made up  
in August. Teams in other sports also postponed games -- the Stanley 
Cup series between the Colorado Avalanche and San Jose Sharks 
scheduled to open with games Wednesday and Thursday nights in 
Denver now will begin Saturday in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer postponed their  
Saturday night home game against the Chicago Fire. No makeup game 
was immediately announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies are starting a two-week road trip, their longest of  
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball is very, very secondary to what's going on in our  
community,'' said Rockies second baseman Mike Lansing, who lives 
about 10 minutes from the school. ``Maybe it's better that we get 
away and let the community do what they need to do and not worry 
about baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado general manager Bob Gebhard said the Rockies will do  
anything they can to help the community, and that the team expects 
to do something this summer to honor the victims and rescue 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our players have been very emotional about it, as we all have  
been,'' Gephard said. ``I think it was good we were able to go on 
the road and play baseball -- not that we're going to forget.''

<HEADLINE> Wisc. Gov. Calls for Welfare Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Operating under the most flexible welfare  
system in the nation's history, a leading governor called on 
Congress to give states even more freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson said states need more flexibility  
to use their federal welfare dollars to support people who have 
left the rolls but are still struggling in low-wage jobs to leave 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just moving people off welfare,'' Thompson, a  
Republican, told the House Government Reform Committee. ``We want 
to get to the working poor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In total, Thompson suggested that Congress release states from  
nearly a dozen rules laid out by the 1996 welfare overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	Among then: He asked that states be allowed to spend less money  
than the law now requires. He wants more items added to the list of 
acceptable uses for that state money. And he wants work 
requirements relaxed for welfare recipients with the toughest 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 welfare law turned the nation's 61-year-old program for  
serving the poor over to the states, who were given tremendous 
power to develop their own programs within certain rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin has led the nation by cutting the number of people on  
welfare by more than 80 percent. But Thompson noted that the state 
is spending more money for each of the families that remain on 
welfare than it used to since they have more profound problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're dealing with some very fragile human beings,'' he said.  
``You can't do it on the cheap.''

<HEADLINE> NRA Still Plans Denver Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Rifle Association says it has an  
obligation to its members and, despite the wish of city officials, 
will hold a meeting next week in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA spokesman Bill Powers said Thursday the NRA will do only the  
essential annual business required under bylaws of the 
not-for-profit group at its May 1 session. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, in the aftermath of the Littleton, Colo., high  
school killings, the gun group trimmed its conference schedule to 
one day from the three that were planned and canceled seminars, 
luncheons, exhibits and festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an obligation to our members,'' Powers said. ``We will  
be coming to conduct that meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only sideline event that had been left on the calendar, an  
evening reception for Republican Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, also 
has been canceled, Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not say whether people in Denver have been taking Mayor  
Wellington Webb's advice and calling the NRA to tell it not to 
come. ``I don't think it's appropriate to respond to the mayor,'' 
Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb asked citizens to put pressure on the nation's largest  
lobbying group for gun owners, saying, ``Everyday people can make a 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want them here,'' said Denver City Council President  
Allegra ``Happy'' Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, used sawed-off shotguns,  
a semiautomatic rifle, a pistol and homemade bombs to kill 12 
students and one teacher at the school outside Denver on Tuesday 
before killing themselves.

<HEADLINE>  Police Obtain School Security Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The governor toured Columbine High  
School today and emerged saying investigators were all but certain 
that the two gunmen had help from others. Police said security 
cameras may provide crucial evidence of a conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are backpacks with bombs in there everywhere,'' Gov.  
Bill Owens said. ``The officers in there are convinced there had to 
be more people involved. There's just too much stuff in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time-lapse security cameras mounted throughout the school do not  
run continuously, and each tape goes back about a week, said 
sheriff's Lt. John Kiekbusch. He said authorities had not yet 
reviewed the tapes and did not know if the cameras were running 
during the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ideally they would show the movement and also the actual  
placement perhaps of some of the explosive devices, prior to the 
incident,'' Kiekbusch said. ``If that's the case we have got just 
very important evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials returned to campus today to continue scouring for  
hidden explosives a day after the discovery of a powerful bomb made 
from a 20-pound propane tank heightened suspicions that Eric 
Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, intended to destroy the school, 
and could have had help in assembling their arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may have had confederates,'' said sheriff's Sgt. Jim  
Parr. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, President Clinton announced $1.5 million in federal  
aid to help victims pay for funerals, medical expenses, lost wages 
and counseling. In Littleton, students stayed away, frightened and 
mourning. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 15 people, including gunmen Harris and Klebold, died  
in Tuesday's attack. Fourteen students remained hospitalized, 
including eight in critical or serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Explosives expert Sid Woodcock said propane explosives of the  
type found are ``fairly sophisticated.'' Just one bomb ``probably 
would have destroyed a good part of the school,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These subjects were not only on a killing rampage,'' said  
Sheriff John Stone. ``They were going to burn the school up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb was set up with an egg timer, matches and a model  
rocket fuse, said Lawrence Bettendorf, an Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms agent. When the timer went off, it would trigger the 
match, which would light the fuse and ignite a gas can next to the 
propane tank, He said he didn't know why it didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the large bomb, searches have turned up more than 30  
homemade explosives, including pipe bombs and crude hand grenades. 
More may still remain hidden, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sawed-off shotguns, one 9mm semi-automatic rifle and one  
semi-automatic handgun also have been found. 
</P>
<P>
	The weapons did not belong to either of the gunmen's parents,  
and may be difficult to trace because they may have passed through 
many hands before the teen-agers got them, Bettendorf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, documents said court-ordered evaluations of the  
suspects, compiled three months ago after they were caught breaking 
into a van last year, called Harris ``a bright young man who is 
likely to succeed in life'' and found Klebold had ``a great deal of 
potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold and Harris, members of the disaffected ``Trenchcoat  
Mafia'' at Columbine High, finished a juvenile court program 
successfully in February, clearing their records. The county 
district court released copies of the documents, but blacked out 
the officer's name. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Dave Thomas today said he was worried about  
the court officer who handled the evaluation, though he believed he 
did the best job he could do. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's anguishing over what happened here,'' Thomas said. ``He's  
a very dedicated, committed public servant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine will be closed indefinitely. Other schools in the  
district reopened Thursday to tight security. 
</P>
<P>
	At rival Chatfield High School, jittery staff and students  
walked past armed guards to enter as classes reconvened. At one 
point, two bomb squad trucks sped to the school after an unattended 
backpack was found. Students needed parental permission to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't even go to the bathroom without permission, and then  
they time you,'' lamented Holly Bernside, 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County school administrators began trying to return  
normalcy to Columbine students' lives by scouting for alternative 
class sites and planning events like graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The students are saying, `We want to be back together. We want  
to be in school. We want to be with our teachers,''' said 
Superintendent Jane Hammond. Hammond said students will return to 
the same school building next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were questioning classmates and others who knew  
the gunmen. Two fellow members of the Trenchcoat Mafia apologized 
to mourners on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no sign they would do this,'' sobbed Nicole Makham.  
``We would just like to say that we're sorry for what they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Columbine grounds Thursday, there was some hint of the  
crisis lifting. Teachers trickled in to retrieve their cars; an 
investigator rescued 30 baby chicks and a lizard from a science 
lab. 
</P>
<P>
	A mile away, Attorney General Janet Reno commiserated with  
relatives and community leaders as family members prepared for a 
weekend of memorials. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not something that is dealt with in a day or a week or  
a month,'' Reno said. ``This, as we have learned from Oklahoma City 
and other tragedies, is something that must be dealt with over 
time, and we are in this for the long haul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other shooting-related developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Student Bree Pasquale said her life was spared when gunman  
Harris's nose was bloodied by a ricocheting shotgun shell. Harris 
had put a gun to her head and told her she was next when the injury 
distracted him, she told NBC's ``Today'' show this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	--Investigators confirmed they had found a note at one suspect's  
home but refused to discuss its contents. 
</P>
<P>
	--The sheriff's office said it planned to release tapes of some  
911 calls today. 
</P>
<P>
	--Classmates said Klebold and Harris made several class-project  
videos last fall foreshadowing their spasm of violence. In one, 
``they had their friends pretend to be the jocks, and they 
pretended to be the gunmen shooting them,'' high school junior 
Chris Reilly told the Denver Rocky Mountain News. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials said they hadn't yet determined whether such a  
video was made. 
</P>
<P>
	--Police defended their initial response to the school massacre.  
They insisted they were rescuing students within minutes of the 
first 911 call but had to move cautiously because of the danger of 
bombs and bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	--The FBI sent a subpoena to America Online, seeking information  
on Web sites and member profiles thought to belong to Harris or 
Klebold.

very important evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials returned to campus today to continue scouring for  
hidden explosives a day after the discovery of a powerful bomb made 
from a 20-pound propane tank heightened suspicions that Eric 
Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, intended to destroy the school, 
and could have had help in assembling their arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may have had confederates,'' said sheriff's Sgt. Jim  
Parr. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, President Clinton announced $1.5 million in federal  
aid to help victims pay for funerals, medical expenses, lost wages 
and counseling. In Littleton, students stayed away, frightened and 
mourning. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 15 people, including gunmen Harris and Klebold, died  
in Tuesday's attack. Fourteen students remained hospitalized, 
including eight in critical or serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Explosives expert Sid Woodcock said propane explosives of the  
type found are ``fairly sophisticated.'' Just one bomb ``probably 
would have destroyed a good part of the school,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These subjects were not only on a killing rampage,'' said  
Sheriff John Stone. ``They were going to burn the school up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb was set up with an egg timer, matches and a model  
rocket fuse, said Lawrence Bettendorf, an Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms agent. When the timer went off, it would trigger the 
match, which would light the fuse and ignite a gas can next to the 
propane tank, He said he didn't know why it didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the large bomb, searches have turned up more than 30  
homemade explosives, including pipe bombs and crude hand grenades. 
More may still remain hidden, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sawed-off shotguns, one 9mm semi-automatic rifle and one  
semi-automatic handgun also have been found. 
</P>
<P>
	The weapons did not belong to either of the gunmen's parents,  
and may be difficult to trace because they may have passed through 
many hands before the teen-agers got them, Bettendorf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, documents said court-ordered evaluations of the  
suspects, compiled three months ago after they were caught breaking 
into a van last year, called Harris ``a bright young man who is 
likely to succeed in life'' and found Klebold had ``a great deal of 
potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold and Harris, members of the disaffected ``Trenchcoat  
Mafia'' at Columbine High, finished a juvenile court program 
successfully in February, clearing their records. The county 
district court released copies of the documents, but blacked out 
the officer's name. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Dave Thomas today said he was worried about  
the court officer who handled the evaluation, though he believed he 
did the best job he could do. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's anguishing over what happened here,'' Thomas said. ``He's  
a very dedicated, committed public servant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine will be closed indefinitely. Other schools in the  
district reopened Thursday to tight security. 
</P>
<P>
	At rival Chatfield High School, jittery staff and students  
walked past armed guards to enter as classes reconvened. At one 
point, two bomb squad trucks sped to the school after an unattended 
backpack was found. Students needed parental permission to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't even go to the bathroom without permission, and then  
they time you,'' lamented Holly Bernside, 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County school administrators began trying to return  
normalcy to Columbine students' lives by scouting for alternative 
class sites and planning events like graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The students are saying, `We want to be back together. We want  
to be in school. We want to be with our teachers,''' said 
Superintendent Jane Hammond. Hammond said students will return to 
the same school building next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were questioning classmates and others who knew  
the gunmen. Two fellow members of the Trenchcoat Mafia apologized 
to mourners on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no sign they would do this,'' sobbed Nicole Makham.  
``We would just like to say that we're sorry for what they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Columbine grounds Thursday, there was some hint of the  
crisis lifting. Teachers trickled in to retrieve their cars; an 
investigator rescued 30 baby chicks and a lizard from a science 
lab. 
</P>
<P>
	A mile away, Attorney General Janet Reno commiserated with  
relatives and community leaders as family members prepared for a 
weekend of memorials. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not something that is dealt with in a day or a week or  
a month,'' Reno said. ``This, as we have learned from Oklahoma City 
and other tragedies, is something that must be dealt with over 
time, and we are in this for the long haul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other shooting-related developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Student Bree Pasquale said her life was spared when gunman  
Harris's nose was bloodied by a ricocheting shotgun shell. Harris 
had put a gun to her head and told her she was next when the injury 
distracted him, she told NBC's ``Today'' show this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	--Investigators confirmed they had found a note at one suspect's  
home but refused to discuss its contents. 
</P>
<P>
	--The sheriff's office said it planned to release tapes of some  
911 calls today. 
</P>
<P>
	--Classmates said Klebold and Harris made several class-project  
videos last fall foreshadowing their spasm of violence. In one, 
``they had their friends pretend to be the jocks, and they 
pretended to be the gunmen shooting them,'' high school junior 
Chris Reilly told the Denver Rocky Mountain News. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials said they hadn't yet determined whether such a  
video was made. 
</P>
<P>
	--Police defended their initial response to the school massacre.  
They insisted they were rescuing students within minutes of the 
first 911 call but had to move cautiously because of the danger of 
bombs and bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	--The FBI sent a subpoena to America Online, seeking information  
on Web sites and member profiles thought to belong to Harris or 
Klebold.

<HEADLINE> 49er Druckenmiller Charged With Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHRISTIANSBURG, Va. (AP) -- San Francisco 49ers reserve  
quarterback Jim Druckenmiller was charged with rape in an 
indictment unsealed today. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-paragraph indictment said the crime took place March 4,  
and that the woman and a detective testified before a grand jury on 
April 13. No other details were contained in the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither prosecutors in Montgomery County nor lawyers for  
Druckenmiller would discuss the matter when contacted Thursday 
night, and the 26-year-old Druckenmiller could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment was ordered unsealed by Montgomery County Circuit  
Judge Ray Grubbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining the NFL team, Druckenmiller was the quarterback  
at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, a town in Montgomery County. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk Reynolds, a spokesman for the 49ers, said Druckenmiller and  
his teammates underwent physical examinations Thursday at the 
49ers' headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	As a rookie in 1997, Druckenmiller played in four games, one as  
a starter, and completed 21 of 52 passes for 239 yards and one 
touchdown. But he also threw three interceptions, two inside the 
opponent's 20 yard line. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, he did not throw a pass, and Ty Detmer became the  
No. 2 quarterback behind Young. 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1996, Druckenmiller was cleared of a charge of  
malicious wounding in the beating of a Virginia Tech student 
outside a Blacksburg bar.

<HEADLINE> 49er Druckenmiller Charged With Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHRISTIANSBURG, Va. (AP) -- San Francisco 49ers quarterback Jim  
Druckenmiller was charged with raping a Virgina Tech student March 
4, according to an indictment unsealed today. 
</P>
<P>
	The unidentified woman and a detective testified before a grand  
jury April 13. The indictment was ordered unsealed late Thursday by 
Montgomery County Circuit Judge Ray Grubbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Peggy Frank said today the woman had asked the  
indictment be sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's got a few more weeks of school and she was concerned  
about getting through that with some sort of privacy,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller, a former Virginia Tech quarterback, is accused of  
attacking the woman in a house in Blacksburg between 3 a.m. and 4 
a.m., and the woman went to the hospital later that morning. Frank 
declined to disclose other details. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank said Druckenmiller's lawyer assured prosecutors that the  
26-year-old player will surrender by Wednesday, his initial court 
appearance. If convicted of rape, he could face five years to life 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller's lawyer, Bev Davis, was unavailable for comment  
this morning. Druckenmiller could not be reached and his agent, 
Gary Wichard, did not immediately return telephone messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk Reynolds, a spokesman for the 49ers, said Druckenmiller and  
his teammates underwent physical examinations Thursday at team 
headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Druckenmiller was cleared in the beating of a Virginia  
Tech student outside a Blacksburg bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller was the 49ers' top pick and the 26th selection  
overall in the 1997 draft. Coach Steve Mariucci called him the 
team's quarterback of the future, the successor to Steve Young. But 
he has played little and is now the third quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller was Virginia Tech's fourth leading career passer.  
The 6-foot-4 1/2, 240-pounder led the Hokies to a 20-4 record as a 
starter, including a victory over Texas in the Sugar Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks End Week Up / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks were boosted today by a new record  
closing on Wall Street overnight and growing hopes for more 
government measures to stimulate the economy. The dollar slipped 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 257.37 points,  
or 1.54 percent, ending the day at 16,923.25. On Thursday, the 
average gained 170.86 points, or 1.04 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.58 yen at late afternoon, down 0.38 yen  
from late Thursday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 
119.55 yen overnight. The currency ranged from 119.18 to 119.72. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, investors bought shares encouraged by an  
overnight rally in New York stocks after a higher-than-expected 
profit report by computer giant International Business Machines. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM said it had posted a 42 percent gain in first-quarter  
profits and across-the-board growth in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed  
145.76 points, or 1.37 percent, closing at 10,727.18, a record 
high. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the market today were hopes for more government  
stimulus measures, sparked by a newspaper report that Prime 
Minister Keizo Obuchi would disclose a plan to put together a new 
package of economic measures in his meeting with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton early in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section was estimated at 565 million shares,  
up from 474 million shares Thursday. Advancing issues outnumbered 
retreaters 809 to 359, with 148 issues unchanged. High-technology 
issues, including Fujitsu and NEC, were among the gainers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Tokyo market lacked the energy today to go higher as  
players avoided taking large positions ahead of the upcoming 
``Golden Week'' holidays in Japan and a meeting of finance 
ministers of the Group of Seven industrialized nations on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 21.03 points, or 1.60 percent, to 1,335.47. 
The TOPIX closed up 2.68 points, or 0.20 percent on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar was pushed down in the afternoon  
after the Yomiuri newspaper report on an additional stimulus 
package renewed concerns about the nation's economy. Government 
officials denied the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was subdued with many players taking a wait-and-see  
attitude ahead of the G-7 meeting to await any comments regarding 
currency levels. 
</P>
<P>
	In other major currencies, the euro was traded at 127.28 yen,  
down from 127.74 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the newly selected benchmark No. 212 10-year  
Japanese government bond rose to 1.535 percent from Thursday's 
finish of 1.490 percent, driving down its price to 102.31 yen from 
102.71 yen.

in the opposite direction, was unchanged at 5.60 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities

percentage point to 4.41 percent. One-year yields were 4.67 percent 
as the discount fell by 0.01 percentage point to 4.46 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, remained unchanged from Thursday at 4.56 percent. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Opening Statements at NATO Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Statements opening the 50th anniversary NATO summit by  
Secretary-General Javier Solana and President Clinton, as 
transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	SOLANA: Good morning. Allow me to welcome you all to this first  
meeting of NATO heads of state of governments of 19. I send a 
special warm greeting to those representing their country for the 
first time at a NATO summit, and in particular to the leaders of 
the three new members of the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	I should also like to thank the government of the United States  
of America for this arrangement of the summit. 
</P>
<P>
	We have gathered here in Washington for a historic 50th  
anniversary. This alliance, for half a century, has assured peace, 
stability and freedom of the European continent. As we celebrate 
past achievements, we are determined to see these principles 
carried into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
	As we meet in Washington today, Europe is confronting a very  
serious crisis. Images of hundreds of thousands of deported people, 
burning homes and destroyed villages recall things we had hoped 
never to see again. 
</P>
<P>
	The crisis in Kosovo represented from the mental challenge to  
the values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law for which 
the alliance has its roots and foundation. That is why the 19 
democratic nations around this table could not remain indifferent. 
That is why we had to act. 
</P>
<P>
	As we continue our military operations with the ultimate aim of  
securing a just political solution to the crisis, NATO allies are 
united in their resolve to see this challenge through. The plan 
must and will prevail. Milosevic must know there is no place for 
his policies in Europe on the eve of the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	The vision of this Europe is one in which all nations can live  
together in peace and in prosperity. It is a Europe whose people 
feel secure, threatened neither by their neighbors nor by their own 
rulers. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO is playing its part to help this vision come true, together  
with its partners in the Atlantic community. I'm confident that our 
meeting today and over the next few days will continue to this 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	I would like now to give the floor to our host, the president of  
the United States, President Clinton. President Clinton, the floor 
is yours. 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary-General. Mr.  
Secretary-General, fellow leaders, let me begin by welcoming you 
warmly to the United States. We are honored to host this 50th 
anniversary summit of NATO. We meet to honor NATO's past, to chart 
its future, to reaffirm our mission in Kosovo, where NATO is 
defending our values and our vision of a Europe free, undivided and 
at peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, we send a clear message of unity and determination to  
sustain our air campaign for as long as it takes; to stand firm in 
our conditions for ending it; to pursue diplomatic initiatives to 
meet those conditions; to increase political and economic pressure 
against the regime in Belgrade; to stand by the front-line nations 
threatened by Belgrade's actions; and to work with them for 
stability, democracy and prosperity in southeastern Europe, so that 
when Mr. Milosevic's vision for the future is defeated, a better 
one can rise in its place. 
</P>
<P>
	We will seek to do this together with our European partners and  
with NATO -- with Ukraine and with Russia. We will make clear what 
is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Milosevic's forces burn and loot homes and murder innocent  
people. Our forces deliver food and shelter and hope to the 
displaced. Mr. Milosevic fans the flames of anger between nations 
and peoples. We are an alliance of 19 nations, uniting 780 million 
people of many faiths and ethnic, racial and religious backgrounds. 
Mr. Milosevic knows only one way to achieve his aims -- through 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	We have done everything we could to resolve this matter  
peacefully. But when we fight, we fight to prevail -- to prevail in 
this conflict and to build the undivided democratic Europe that the 
founders of NATO envisioned 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you and welcome again.

<HEADLINE> Armed Calif. Teen Gives Himself Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCUTT, Calif. (AP) -- A teen-ager who claimed to be distraught  
over losing a relative in the Colorado high school shooting 
barricaded himself in a bank Friday with at least four employees. 
Two hours later, he released the hostages unharmed and gave up. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old, who was not identified because of his age,  
called police from inside Hacienda Bank about 2:50 p.m. and said he 
had a relative who died in the massacre at Columbine High School, 
said Sgt. Bill Turner of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	After about two hours, he began releasing hostages one at a time  
until only a woman remained inside with him. He then gave up his 
satchel, which contained the alleged bomb he used to take hostages 
and walked out of the bank with his hands up, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were trying to determine if he had in fact lost a  
relative in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Orcutt is about 60 miles northwest of Santa Barbara.

<HEADLINE> Powerful Winds Sweep Across Utah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIGHAM CITY, Utah (AP) -- Winds gusting to more than 100 mph  
swept across northern Utah today, overturning 20 tractor-trailers, 
knocking out power to as many as 10,000 customers and forcing 
schools to close. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong winds are common in Utah during the spring and fall. But  
Friday's windstorm was the strongest in 15 years, said William 
Adler, a National Weather Service forecaster. 
</P>
<P>
	A 113 mph gust was recorded at the Brigham City Airport at about  
1 a.m., with sustained winds reaching 72 mph early in the day. 
Police estimated damage to the airport at more than $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	By evening, gusts of up to 80 mph were still being reported at  
the Brigham City Airport, but had died down some across much of the 
rest of the region, giving residents and power crews a chance to 
clean up. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 10,000 customers were without power at some point  
Friday, and crews were hoping to have power completely restored by 
Saturday morning, said Dave Eskelsen, spokesman for Utah Power, 
said 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still battling with it. I think now that the winds dying  
down a little bit our repairs will go a little faster,'' he said. 
Gusty winds made repairs dangerous and knocked out service to areas 
workers had just repaired. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty tractor-trailers were blown over on Interstate 15, the  
state's main north-south road. Trucks were banned from the highway. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ogden, a crane on top of the municipal building fell onto the  
roof. Its 500-pound wrecking ball landed on the city jail, forcing 
office workers to evacuate. No inmates escaped. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw it swinging from the north after I caught movement out  
of the corner of my eye,'' Sheriff's Chief Deputy A.K. Greenwood 
said. ``I thought, whoa, that baby is on the move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wind also uprooted trees and tore shingles off roofs.  
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen schools called off class because of power outages and  
minor damage.

<HEADLINE> School Shooting Prompts TV Turnout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The images of terrified students running from  
Columbine High and the mystery of why two teen-agers ended their 
lives in horrifying violence have clearly struck a chord with TV 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Several news programs have seen dramatic ratings increases in  
the wake of the Colorado school massacre, leaving networks hustling 
to fill the hunger for information. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people are frightened,'' said Susan Zirinsky,  
executive producer of CBS's ``48 Hours.'' Wednesday night's ``Young 
Guns'' episode had higher ratings than any ``48 Hours'' show since 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS quickly responded by scheduling a special edition of the  
newsmagazine for Saturday night, calling it ``After the Tears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zirinsky recognized the story's emotional impact when she found  
herself crying in her office while watching reports of the 
massacre.

	``It's such a universal story,'' said Neal Shapiro, executive  
producer of ``Dateline NBC.'' ``There's a high school in everyone's 
neighborhood, everyone has kids. The images are so awful and they 
feel so personal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Dateline NBC'' covered the story Tuesday night, aired a  
special two-hour edition Wednesday, devoted Friday's show to the 
tragedy and will do the same Sunday. Wednesday's two-hour show 
focused on Littleton during its second hour, and that drew 2.3 
million more viewers than the first. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``20/20'' on Wednesday was the evening's most-watched  
prime-time program. Only the Monica Lewinsky interview rated higher 
among Wednesday editions of the newsmagazine this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The three cable news networks each had roughly two and a half  
times their average audiences on Tuesday and Wednesday. Fox News 
Channel recorded its highest 24-hour rating ever the day of the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro said viewers are curious about how the massacre  
happened, but are also interested in how weapons are so easily 
obtained, whether schools are secure and what's behind the violence 
committed by so many young people. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you think about teen-agers today and why they are so  
different than when we were teen-agers,'' he said. ``The stresses 
are the same. Why are they shooting each other?''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Aid for Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today announced $1.5 million  
in federal aid to help victims of the Colorado school shooting pay 
for funerals, uninsured medical expenses, lost wages and 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said the money was an initial payment to help the  
students, teachers and parents in Littleton on ``their long journey 
toward recovery. And we will do more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The aid was drawn from the federal Crime Victims' Fund. The  
president made the announcement at a brief White House event before 
turning his attention to the 50th anniversary NATO summit. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore was traveling to Colorado to attend  
memorial services. 
</P>
<P>
	``The images from Colorado have become painfully familiar: the  
terrified children, the racing ambulances, the grieving families,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Still, it is important to remember that the vast majority of  
schools are safe,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton reminded school officials across the country of federal  
programs to help prevent violent eruptions of rage, such as the two 
students unleashed inside Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Next to the school, in Clement Park, a Sunday afternoon memorial  
service was planned for the one teacher and 12 students gunned down 
before their two murderous classmates turned their guns on 
themselves. The vice president and Tipper Gore planned to attend 
the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced that the early warning guides sent to 200,000  
schools in August would be reprinted and distributed next week to 
150,000 additional schools. Clinton also alerted schools that they 
have until the end of this month to apply for a portion of the $17 
million available for school-crime prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Local communities have until June 1 to apply for some $180  
million in Safe Schools/Healthy Students grants, a federal 
anti-violence and anti-drug-abuse initiative developed after the 
White House conference on school safety last October. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department is also providing, as part of an existing  
grant program, $70 million to station some 600 police officers for 
school security in 336 communities around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is offering help, Clinton said.  
</P>
<P>
	``But for it to work, people have to use the resources that are  
there, and implement the systems that are there, and it has to be 
done in every school in the country,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Earnings Flat for Washington Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington Post Co. reported Friday that  
its earnings were flat in the first quarter despite higher revenues 
because of costs associated with expanding its businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post earned $45.2 million in the three months  
ended April 4, up slightly from $45.1 million in the same period a 
year ago. Per-share earnings rose to $4.41 from $4.40. 
</P>
<P>
	The year-ago figures do not include a one-time gain of $162.8  
million, or $16.07 per share, for the sale of the company's 28 
percent stake in Cowles Media Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the quarter rose 8 percent to $520 million from  
$484 million in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its flagship newspaper, the Washington Post also  
owns Newsweek magazine, several community newspapers in Maryland, 
cable and broadcast TV properties and the Kaplan test-preparation 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspaper revenues rose 2 percent, but expenses rose 4 percent  
due to the cost of new printing facilities and higher promotional 
spending. Daily circulation was unchanged at The Washington Post, 
but Sunday circulation declined by 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcast revenues increased by 2 percent. Revenues for the  
cable television division jumped by 20 percent, while magazine 
revenues declined slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kaplan Educational Centers division had a 45 percent  
increase in revenues to $57.4 million, but operating losses topped 
$7 million. The division specializes in educational test 
preparation programs, and produces career fairs. Officials said the 
losses were due to expansion of services and a seasonal decline in 
interest in test preparation.

<HEADLINE> Europeans Chafe at Olympic Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European Olympic officials have denounced U.S.  
``political interference'' in the wake of the Salt Lake corruption 
scandal and set the stage for a transatlantic battle over games' 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans said they may launch a pan-European corporate  
sponsorship program in response to possible anti-IOC legislation in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	They rejected the contention that American political  
intervention is justified because U.S.-based sponsors and 
television networks provide the bulk of Olympic revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	``The position of the American senators is not acceptable,''  
Mario Pescante, secretary general of the European Olympic 
Committees, said Friday. ``If this political interference goes on, 
Europe can go it alone. This is a strong message that members of 
other countries, above all the European countries, are very angry 
about the U.S. position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Congress have been highly critical of the  
International Olympic Committee following the vote-buying scandal 
stemming from Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	At an April 14 hearing, senators accused the IOC of fostering a  
``culture of corruption'' and not acting swiftly or forcefully 
enough to enact reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the IOC has purged 10 members, tightened the bidding and  
selection process for the 2006 games, and set up ethics and reform 
commissions. 
</P>
<P>
	One member of the Senate Commerce Committee, Alaska Republican  
Ted Stevens, has drafted a bill to strip the IOC's tax-exempt 
status and limit deductions sponsors can take for Olympic fees -- a 
move the sponsors say would drive them away. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would give the U.S. Olympic Committee control over  
U.S. TV rights fees for the games, still the IOC's single biggest 
income source. 
</P>
<P>
	``I consider this position a threat,'' Pescante said. ``It is  
not based on ethical reasons but only on financial and economic 
reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The executive committee of the European Olympic body, meeting  
this week in Spain, said the IOC was capable of solving its 
problems and rejecting ``all political interference which threatens 
the independence of the Olympic movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans said they supported the contribution of global  
Olympic sponsors, but noted that the USOC gets more marketing 
revenue than all other 199 national Olympic bodies combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current distribution system, the USOC receives 20  
percent of the total revenue generated by the IOC's worldwide 
sponsorship program known as TOP. The other national bodies get 20 
percent, the IOC 10 percent and local organizing committees 50 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``If necessary, we are prepared to cooperate with the IOC with  
the view to study the implementation of a pan-European marketing 
program which will ensure that all Olympic committees, particularly 
those from the developing countries, will benefit by this 
project,'' the European statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the European body, IOC executive board member  
Jacques Rogge of Belgium, said the project would be launched if 
Congress adopts the legislation to limit sponsor deductions. 
</P>
<P>
	Such legislation would cripple the TOP program. Nine of the 11  
international sponsors -- who pay around $50 million for a four-year 
package -- are based in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the program will continue,'' Rogge said. ``But if the  
program cannot continue because of political interference, we would 
study with the IOC the launch of a pan-European program on a 
permanent basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is: please don't intervene with politics and  
sport,'' Rogge said. ``We have bad reminiscence of Jimmy Carter 
calling for a boycott of the 1980 Olympics. We are saying, `Please 
respect the independence of sports.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said Olympic officials had been studying for more than a  
year the possibility of setting up a pan-European sponsorship 
program for the 2004 Athens Games. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Greek economy is too small to raise enough local  
sponsorship revenue, so the IOC is considering signing up European 
multinationals to supplement -- not replace -- the existing worldwide 
program. That separate project remains under review.

<HEADLINE>  Bomb Found in High School Kitchen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Eyeing a possibly broader conspiracy,  
investigators in the Columbine High School massacre said two 
teen-agers who gunned down a dozen classmates and a teacher may 
have been aided in their rampage by ``confederates'' who helped 
booby-trap the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's officials were due back on campus by dawn today to  
continue scouring for hidden explosives as students stayed away, 
frightened and mourning. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 15 people, including gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan  
Klebold, died in the Tuesday attack. Fourteen students remained 
hospitalized, including eight in critical or serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the discovery of a powerful bomb made from a  
20-pound propane tank heightened suspicions that Harris, 18, and 
Kleblod, 17, intended to destroy the school, and could have had 
help in assembling their arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may have had confederates,'' said sheriff's Sgt. Jim  
Parr. 
</P>
<P>
	Explosives expert Sid Woodcock said propane explosives of the  
type found are ``fairly sophisticated.'' Just one bomb ``probably 
would have destroyed a good part of the school,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These subjects were not only on a killing rampage,'' said  
Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone. ``They were going to burn the 
school up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the large bomb, searches have turned up more than 30  
homemade explosives, including pipe bombs, crude hand grenades. 
More may still remain hidden, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sawed-off shotguns, one 9mm semi-automatic rifle and one  
semi-automatic handgun also have been found. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have also recovered, but have not yet reviewed, a  
videotape from a school security system that covers the library 
where many of the victims were found, The Denver Post reported 
today, citing sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, documents said court-ordered evaluations of the  
suspects, compiled earlier this year, called Harris ``a bright 
young man who is likely to succeed in life'' and found Klebold had 
``a great deal of potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine will be closed indefinitely. Other schools in the  
district reopened Thursday to tight security. 
</P>
<P>
	At rival Chatfield High School, jittery staff and students  
walked past armed guards to enter as classes reconvened. At one 
point, two bomb squad trucks sped to the school after an unattended 
backpack was found. Students needed parental permission to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't even go to the bathroom without permission, and then  
they time you,'' lamented Holly Bernside, 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County school administrators began trying to return  
normalcy to Columbine students' lives by scouting for alternative 
class sites and planning events like graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The students are saying, `We want to be back together. We want  
to be in school. We want to be with our teachers,''' said 
Superintendent Jane Hammond. Hammond said students will return to 
the same school building next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jefferson County Court reports on Klebold and Harris,  
written less than three months ago, were compiled by an officer 
assessing their future after they were caught breaking into a van 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold and Harris, members of the disaffected, brooding  
``Trenchcoat Mafia'' at Columbine High, finished a juvenile court 
program successfully in February, clearing their records. The 
county district court released copies of the documents, but blacked 
out the officer's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were questioning classmates and others who knew  
the gunmen. Two fellow members of the Trenchcoat Mafia apologized 
to mourners on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no sign they would do this,'' sobbed Nicole Makham.  
``We would just like to say that we're sorry for what they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Columbine grounds Thursday, there was some hint of the  
crisis lifting. Teachers trickled in to retrieve their cars; an 
investigator rescued 30 baby chicks and a lizard from a science 
lab. 
</P>
<P>
	A mile away, Attorney General Janet Reno commiserated with  
relatives and community leaders as family members prepared for a 
weekend of memorials. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not something that is dealt with in a day or a week or  
a month,'' Reno said. ``This, as we have learned from Oklahoma City 
and other tragedies, is something that must be dealt with over 
time, and we are in this for the long haul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other shooting-related developments Thursday:  
</P>
<P>
	--Investigators confirmed they had found a note at one suspect's  
home but refused to discuss its contents. 
</P>
<P>
	--The sheriff's office said it planned to release tapes of some  
911 calls today. 
</P>
<P>
	--Classmates said Klebold and Harris made several class-project  
videos last fall foreshadowing their spasm of violence. In one, 
``they had their friends pretend to be the jocks, and they 
pretended to be the gunmen shooting them,'' high school junior 
Chris Reilly told the Denver Rocky Mountain News. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials said they hadn't yet determined whether such a  
video was made. 
</P>
<P>
	--Police defended their initial response to the school massacre.  
They insisted they were rescuing students within minutes of the 
first 911 call but had to move cautiously because of the danger of 
bombs and bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	--The FBI sent a subpoena to America Online, seeking information  
on Web sites and member profiles thought to belong to Harris or 
Klebold.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Changes Stall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says he's ``deeply  
disappointed'' by indications that Republican leaders in Congress 
may be reluctant to start making changes to shore up Social 
Security before the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert said the Republicans are just  
waiting for more ideas to consider so that bipartisan agreement can 
be reached on what should be done. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republican leaders have yet to consider my proposals or  
advance any of their own,'' Clinton said in a statement released 
Friday. He accused GOP leaders of ``sending a message that Congress 
is either unable or unwilling to face up to the challenge of 
strengthening Social Security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some influential Republican lawmakers are close to unveiling  
plans to overhaul Social Security and had been reaching out to 
moderate Democrats to forge alliances in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders so far have not come forward or signaled that they  
intend to endorse any of the plans, however, although they have 
been kept abreast of the efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	And some rank-and-file Republicans say party leaders have told  
them that trying to overhaul Social Security this year, with the 
2000 presidential elections looming, could be too politically 
risky. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., denied that he's abandoned  
efforts to pass legislation to shore up the nation's retirement 
program this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope that over time even more ideas emerge and make  
their way into the public dialog so that eventually a bipartisan 
solution to strengthening Social Security can be found,'' Hastert 
said in a statement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Republican lawmakers working on a Social Security overhaul  
are the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Bill 
Archer, R-Texas, and Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla. They want to use 
expected government surpluses to fund a new system of personal 
retirement accounts American workers could invest in the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Those familiar with the Archer-Shaw plan say investment earnings  
would be substituted, on an individual basis, for traditional 
Social Security benefits, likely at something close to a 
dollar-for-dollar exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republican Sens. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and Rick  
Santorum of Pennsylvania are collaborating with moderate Democrats 
including Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., on a plan combining similar 
personal accounts with upfront trimming of Social Security 
benefits. House members Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., and Charles Stenholm, 
D-Texas, recently joined the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Both groups said they plan to go ahead and introduce their  
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe that President Clinton wants to work in a  
bipartisan fashion to save Social Security, and I want to work with 
him,'' Archer said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his statement Friday, Clinton said: ``I remain committed to  
working with members of Congress of both parties who are committed 
to enacting comprehensive Social Security legislation this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republican lawmakers, however, are saying Democrats are  
holding up movement for their own political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``With an issue of this scope, the likelihood of moving Social  
Security reform or modernization is not going to take place without 
the president taking ... a lead,'' Sen. Connie Mack of Florida, who 
chairs the Senate Republican Conference, said in an interview this 
week. ``Frankly, we think he ducked it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Democrats blocked an attempt by Republicans to get  
a Senate vote on a measure that would make it more difficult for 
lawmakers to spend surpluses that come from Social Security taxes, 
rather than income taxes, on anything but shoring up the retirement 
program or paying off the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has his own plan for the Social Security surpluses,  
introduced in this year's State of the Union speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the GOP plan, his also would use surpluses to help pay off  
the national debt. But Clinton wants to try to give Social Security 
a tangible claim on the economic growth that would be expected to 
result: IOUs that would assure the program income-tax dollars after 
baby boomers retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also has suggested government investment of some of  
Social Security's cash reserves in the stock market.

<HEADLINE> Schrader Wins Talladega Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLADEGA, Ala. (AP) -- The latest trend in qualifying at  
Talladega Superspeedway is to build momentum on the first lap by 
driving the high line on the banked oval, then taking the low line 
for the speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really know if that works or not,'' Ken Schrader said  
Friday after winning the pole for the DieHard 500 with a sizzling 
lap of 197.765 mph. ``But if those other guys are doing it, I guess 
I've got to try it, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far so good for Schrader, who won the pole for the Winston  
500 here last fall and also took the top qualifying spot for 
Saturday's Busch Series race on the 2.66-mile, high-banked oval, 
the fastest track in NASCAR. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Schrader has 23 Winston Cup poles, but just four  
victories. As nice as it is to lead qualifying, the 43-year-old 
driver would really like to emulate what Bobby Labonte did here 
last spring, winning from the pole. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can (win),'' Schrader said. ``There's a lot of guys that  
can. You just have to stay out of trouble all day, and that ain't 
easy at this place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for winning the pole, Schrader gave most of the credit to his  
crew and his Chevrolet, the same car in which he won the pole last 
October, then qualified third and finished sixth in the Daytona 500 
in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``The driver didn't do much today,'' he said. ``It makes a big  
difference what kind of ride you have. The guys at the shop had the 
car all geared up. It was good in practice and the guys don't put 
the whole (qualifying) package on it in practice, so we knew it 
would be close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte was close behind in a Pontiac at 197.488, followed by  
the Ford of series points leader Jeff Burton at 197.252. 
</P>
<P>
	With the cars nearing 200 mph again, despite the carburetor  
restrictor plates required by NASCAR at Talladega and Daytona, 
Schrader was asked why the speeds keep increasing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's just done a good job of getting the cars down to  
the ground and everybody's done a good job of getting more 
horsepower,'' he said. ``They just keep making the cars slicker. 
Nobody backs up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte, almost healed from the shoulderblade broken in a crash  
earlier this season in Dover, Del., said, ``You just expect to be 
fast at Talladega. The numbers don't mean much. If it's 193 or 196 
or 199, it's fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Nemechek was fourth in the opening qualifying session at  
197.187, followed by Rusty Wallace at 196.616, Mark Martin at 
196.584, Ricky Rudd at 196.362, rookie Tony Stewart at 196.346, 
Chad Little at 196.065 and, rounding out the top 10, Michael 
Waltrip at 195.989. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Gordon, the two-time defending Winston Cup champion, was a  
little disappointed after qualifying 13th at 195.880. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pole at Daytona and now 13th here,'' Gordon lamented.  
``We're starting further back than I'd like to. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ran about what we tested here, but we thought when it came  
to qualifying we'd pick up. It felt like it was going to be a good 
lap, but we've been a little off all day.

	``Now we'll go to work on the race setup. I think we'll be good

<HEADLINE> Couch Practices With the Browns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- The ball came out of Tim Couch's hand, a  
perfect spiral, and flew 30 yards on a line down field into the 
hands of ... defensive back Eric Stokes -- an interception! 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, well, what do you want on the first day, even a No. 1 draft  
pick's first day? 
</P>
<P>
	Couch, the top selection in last weekend's draft, and the other  
Cleveland rookies practiced as pros for the first time Friday, 
joining Browns veterans at a weekend minicamp. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch made a few nice plays -- ducking the rush a couple of times  
and hitting receivers out of the backfield -- but at other moments 
he looked like what he is, a rookie struggling to adjust to an NFL 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
	It's little wonder. Couch arrived in Cleveland on Tuesday and  
has been spending about four hours a day trying to learn a big 
chunk of coach Chris Palmer's playbook. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, he's overwhelmed with it. He's like any rookie,''  
Palmer said. ``It all runs together. I take him from first grade to 
graduate school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Palmer still said he was pleased with Couch's overall  
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he threw well,'' Palmer said. ``A couple of times he  
took a five-step drop when he was supposed to take a three-step 
drop, but that's part of the game and learning what we're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch was one of six Cleveland quarterbacks, all standing out in  
their orange, no-contact jerseys, who practiced with the team in a 
fieldhouse at Browns headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns starter Ty Detmer and Couch seemed to be getting a few  
more snaps than the other QBs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it went pretty well, especially for the first day,''  
Couch said. ``I made some mistakes, it was far from perfect, but 
I've got plenty of time to get better.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Decries GOP Inaction on Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he was ``deeply  
disappointed'' by indications Republican leaders may have abandoned 
the idea of fundamentally changing Social Security before the 2000 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just one week after passing a budget that promises a massive  
$800 billion tax cut, the Republican leadership is sending a 
message that Congress is either unable or unwilling to face up to 
the challenge of strengthening Social Security,'' Clinton said in a 
statement. ``That is not acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert denied that the GOP  
leadership has given up on moving Social Security legislation this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The speaker remains committed to encouraging as many ideas as  
possible to come to the fore regarding the strengthening of Social 
Security,'' said Hastert spokesman Pete Jeffries. ``We have to get 
as many ideas out there as possible so that we see if we can 
develop a bipartisan consensus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some influential Republican lawmakers are close to unveiling  
plans to overhaul Social Security and had been reaching out to 
moderate Democrats to forge alliances in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	However, GOP leaders have so far not come forward or signaled  
that they intend to endorse any of the plans, although the 
leadership has been kept apprised of the ongoing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Republican House members say they have been told by  
their party's leaders that trying to overhaul Social Security this 
year, with the 2000 presidential election looming, would be too 
politically risky, according to a report in today's New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said the Republican leadership was citing GOP polls  
indicating that among Americans who feel strongly about Social 
Security, more were skeptical than receptive about Republican 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in his statement today, said: ``I am deeply  
disappointed by reports that the congressional Republican 
leadership has abandoned the effort to enact legislation this year 
to strengthen Social Security for the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remain committed to working with members of Congress of both  
parties who are committed to enacting comprehensive Social Security 
legislation this year,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Republican lawmakers working on Social Security overhaul  
plans is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. 
Bill Archer, R-Texas, and Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla. They want to use 
expected government surpluses to fund a new system of personal 
retirement accounts American workers could invest in the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Those familiar with the Archer-Shaw plan say that the investment  
earnings would be substituted, on an individual basis, for 
traditional Social Security benefits, likely at something close to 
a dollar-for-dollar exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republican Sens. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and Rick  
Santorum of Pennsylvania are collaborating with moderate Democrats 
including Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., on a plan combining similar 
personal accounts with upfront trimming of Social Security 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Both groups say they plan to go ahead and introduce their ideas.  
</P>
<P>
	Many Republican lawmakers, however, are accusing Democrats of  
holding up movement on Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``With an issue of this scope, the likelihood of moving Social  
Security reform or modernization is not going to take place without 
the president taking ... a lead,'' Sen. Connie Mack of Florida, who 
chairs the Senate Republican Conference., said in an interview 
earlier this week. ``Frankly, we think he ducked it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Democrats blocked an attempt by Republicans to get  
a vote on the Senate floor on a measure that would make it more 
difficult for lawmakers to spend surpluses that come from Social 
Security taxes, rather than income taxes, on anything but shoring 
up the retirement program or paying off the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has his own plan for the Social Security surpluses,  
introduced in his State of the Union speech earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	He would also use the surpluses to pay down the national debt,  
but wants to try to give Social Security a tangible claim on the 
economic growth that would be expected to result: IOUs that would 
assure the program income-tax dollars after baby boomers retire. 
Clinton also has called for government investment of some of Social 
Security's cash reserves in the stock market.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Beach Water Quality Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved legislation Thursday that  
would set national standards for beach water quality and require 
monitoring and notification to the public when the water is 
contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar bill has been introduced in the Senate, but no action  
has been taken there. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public has a right to know what they're swimming in,''  
said Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., key sponsors of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation requires the Environmental Protection Agency to  
establish criteria for pathogens and microorganisms in beach water. 
States and local governments would be required to establish 
standards as well as monitoring and notification programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also authorizes $150 million over five years to help  
pay for the monitoring and notification programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Only eight states have comprehensive monitor of their beach  
water and notification to the public of health risks, said Tim 
Eichenberg of the Center for Marine Conservation. He said federal 
requirements are ``long overdue'' for public protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The new requirements if they are enacted would go far to further  
protect the public against disease-causing pathogens when they 
swim, surf or play in coastal waters, said Eichenberg, whose 
organization strongly endorsed the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	States that now monitor all their beach water and give public  
notification are Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, New 
Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Some other states have limited monitoring while other states  
have no monitoring or notification program at all.

<HEADLINE>  Bomb Found in High School Kitchen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Eyeing a possibly broader conspiracy,  
investigators in the Columbine High School massacre said two 
teen-agers who gunned down a dozen classmates and a teacher may 
have been aided in their rampage by ``confederates'' who helped 
booby-trap the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's officials were due back on campus by dawn today to  
continue scouring for hidden explosives as students stayed away, 
frightened and mourning. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 15 people, including gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan  
Klebold, died in the Tuesday attack. Fourteen students remained 
hospitalized, including eight in critical or serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the discovery of a powerful bomb made from a  
20-pound propane tank heightened suspicions that Harris, 18, and 
Kleblod, 17, intended to destroy the school, and could have had 
help in assembling their arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may have had confederates,'' said sheriff's Sgt. Jim  
Parr. 
</P>
<P>
	Explosives expert Sid Woodcock said propane explosives of the  
type found are ``fairly sophisticated.'' Just one bomb ``probably 
would have destroyed a good part of the school,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These subjects were not only on a killing rampage,'' said  
Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone. ``They were going to burn the 
school up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the large bomb, searches have turned up more than 30  
homemade explosives, including pipe bombs, crude hand grenades. 
More may still remain hidden, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sawed-off shotguns, one 9mm semi-automatic rifle and one  
semi-automatic handgun also have been found. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have also recovered, but have not yet reviewed, a  
videotape from a school security system that covers the library 
where many of the victims were found, The Denver Post reported 
today, citing sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, documents said court-ordered evaluations of the  
suspects, compiled earlier this year, called Harris ``a bright 
young man who is likely to succeed in life'' and found Klebold had 
``a great deal of potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine will be closed indefinitely. Other schools in the  
district reopened Thursday to tight security. 
</P>
<P>
	At rival Chatfield High School, jittery staff and students  
walked past armed guards to enter as classes reconvened. At one 
point, two bomb squad trucks sped to the school after an unattended 
backpack was found. Students needed parental permission to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't even go to the bathroom without permission, and then  
they time you,'' lamented Holly Bernside, 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County school administrators began trying to return  
normalcy to Columbine students' lives by scouting for alternative 
class sites and planning events like graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The students are saying, `We want to be back together. We want  
to be in school. We want to be with our teachers,''' said 
Superintendent Jane Hammond. Hammond said students will return to 
the same school building next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jefferson County Court reports on Klebold and Harris,  
written less than three months ago, were compiled by an officer 
assessing their future after they were caught breaking into a van 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold and Harris, members of the disaffected, brooding  
``Trenchcoat Mafia'' at Columbine High, finished a juvenile court 
program successfully in February, clearing their records. The 
county district court released copies of the documents, but blacked 
out the officer's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were questioning classmates and others who knew  
the gunmen. Two fellow members of the Trenchcoat Mafia apologized 
to mourners on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no sign they would do this,'' sobbed Nicole Makham.  
``We would just like to say that we're sorry for what they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Columbine grounds Thursday, there was some hint of the  
crisis lifting. Teachers trickled in to retrieve their cars; an 
investigator rescued 30 baby chicks and a lizard from a science 
lab. 
</P>
<P>
	A mile away, Attorney General Janet Reno commiserated with  
relatives and community leaders as family members prepared for a 
weekend of memorials. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not something that is dealt with in a day or a week or  
a month,'' Reno said. ``This, as we have learned from Oklahoma City 
and other tragedies, is something that must be dealt with over 
time, and we are in this for the long haul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other shooting-related developments Thursday:  
</P>
<P>
	--Investigators confirmed they had found a note at one suspect's  
home but refused to discuss its contents. 
</P>
<P>
	--The sheriff's office said it planned to release tapes of some  
911 calls today. 
</P>
<P>
	--Classmates said Klebold and Harris made several class-project  
videos last fall foreshadowing their spasm of violence. In one, 
``they had their friends pretend to be the jocks, and they 
pretended to be the gunmen shooting them,'' high school junior 
Chris Reilly told the Denver Rocky Mountain News. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials said they hadn't yet determined whether such a  
video was made. 
</P>
<P>
	--Police defended their initial response to the school massacre.  
They insisted they were rescuing students within minutes of the 
first 911 call but had to move cautiously because of the danger of 
bombs and bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	--The FBI sent a subpoena to America Online, seeking information  
on Web sites and member profiles thought to belong to Harris or 
Klebold.

<HEADLINE> Horror Buff Gets Burial Wish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COVINA, Calif. (AP) -- Horror buff Rene Ochoa lived by the motto  
of his beloved Phantom Coaches Hearse Club: ``Put the `fun' back in 
funeral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, his fellow club members did just that.  
</P>
<P>
	Ochoa, known for tooling around in his faded 1965 hearse with  
vanity license plate ``GOULISH,'' recently died of kidney failure 
at 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Ochoa once said he wanted to be buried in a sharkskin suit and  
his red bowling shirt, after a last trip in his hearse with a 
motorcade of hearses behind him, friend Kri Kendall said. All of 
his wishes were carried out. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a service at the funeral home, Ochoa's hearse -- which  
he had nicknamed ``Patty Hearse'' -- began the procession to Forest 
Lawn Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen hearses in all took part, with plates like ``LAS RYD''  
and ``MBALMED.'' A Bonneville's nameplate was altered to read 
``Bone Ville,'' while another funeral car had fake skulls and 
cobwebs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The club meant a great deal to him,'' Kendall said. ``I won't  
say we were his life, but we were his lifestyle.''

<HEADLINE> Hoop Stars Said To Fight on Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Pistons teammates Christian Laettner  
and Jerry Stackhouse got into a fist fight over a card game on the 
team plane, the Detroit Free Press reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper quoted an unidentified player who said he saw the  
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked up and they were going at it, throwing blows,'' the  
player said. ``I wasn't about to get in the middle of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One unidentified source told the newspaper the players were  
arguing over $2,000, and Stackhouse struck Laettner's face. The 
Pistons were returning from a game at Charlotte, and the Free Press 
said the Pistons intend to ban card games on future flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman Matt Dobek on Friday dismissed the report of the  
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was on the plane and nothing happened,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Detroit has lost three straight games and seven of its last 10.  
The Pistons are 23-20 on the season and fourth in the Central 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Laettner has been out of the lineup since breaking a rib April 1  
against Chicago. The report said he did not reinjure it in the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Stackhouse has an injured right ankle. His 12-point, 22-minute  
effort in Thursday's 104-96 loss to Philadelphia was his best since 
he was injured March 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Laettner met with coach Alvin Gentry before the game, the  
newspaper said. His return to the lineup could come Sunday at 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll probably be a game-time decision when a decision is  
made,'' Gentry said. ``It could be a 70-30 chance for Sunday or 
60-40. I just don't know. It's more than just missing his 
toughness. He's a 6-10 guy who can get the tough rebound, make the 
tough shot or take a hard foul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The toughest thing about this past month is we haven't had our  
whole team together,'' Gentry added. ``When we were at full 
strength I thought we were a pretty good team. We played good teams 
and we beat good teams.''

<HEADLINE> Wheat Lower, Corn, Beans Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures fell Friday on the Chicago Board of  
Trade, while soybeans and corn rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans and corn received support from forecasts of continued  
rain next week in growing regions of the central United States, 
which was expected to delay planting. 
</P>
<P>
	This came a day after soybean and grain prices were driven  
sharply lower on forecasts for a pattern of dry weather next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Weather, weather and more weather,'' said Don Roose of  
Iowa-based U.S. Commodities Inc. ``That's essentially what broke us 
yesterday and that's what's giving us the strength today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans also took a dive Thursday amid reports that China will  
impose a tax on soybean meal imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures were higher Friday on the same forecasts for rain,  
which was expected to set back planting. There were conflicting 
forecasts, however, which limited gains, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures followed corn and soybeans higher in early  
trading, but later turned lower. The same moisture that was 
expected to delay planting in corn and soybeans could be beneficial 
to the wheat crop, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans for July delivery jumped 2 3/4 cents to $4.94 1/2 a bushel;  
July corn rose 1/2 cent to $2.25 3/4 a bushel; July wheat fell 1 3/4 cent 
to $2.65 3/4 a bushel; July oats rose 2 cents to $1.22 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle was mixed and feeder cattle lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while lean hogs and pork bellies were higher. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .05 cent to 62.72 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle fell .20 cent to 70.62 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
jumped 2.00 cents to 57.60 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose 
1.87 cent to 57.17 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> NATO Resolves To Continue Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Western leaders opened a celebration of NATO's  
50th anniversary today with a pledge to press on in the alliance's 
month-old fight against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
``NATO will not allow his campaign of terror to succeed,'' a draft 
statement declared. 
</P>
<P>
	As 19 NATO leaders debated the Kosovo crisis, Western leaders  
rejected a diplomatic overture from Milosevic to end the bombing, 
NATO's first-ever military offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal did not include a key demand -- removal of  
Milosevic's forces from the Serbian province and an armed 
international peacekeeping force, leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic must know there is no place for his policies in  
Europe on the eve of the 21st century,'' NATO Secretary-General 
Javier Solana said in opening the summit's first session, one 
devoted exclusively to the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance was expected to issue a statement later today  
repeating demands that Milosevic end the violent campaign against 
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, remove his troops and accept an 
international peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hold President Milosevic responsible for the safety of all  
Kosovar citizens,'' said a draft of the statement. ``NATO is 
determined to prevail.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes Other NATO Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- They were told to leave their black ties  
behind, but President Clinton nonetheless staged a regal White 
House bash for 18 colleagues Friday night after a long opening day 
of ceremonies and serious business at NATO's 50th anniversary 
summit. 
</P>
<P>
	A marching band sounded the one-by-one arrival of leaders to the  
north portico entrance of the White House -- where Chief of Protocol 
Mary Mel French offered a personal greeting. An honor guard 
stationed alongside the door scurried to switch flags for each 
guest to display next to the U.S. emblem. 
</P>
<P>
	An intimate East Room with a crescent-shaped table covered in  
green damask cloth set the stage for a feast of seafood and spring 
specialties. White House chefs prepared crispy soft shell crab and 
lobster cakes and spring lamb dashed with lemon for the dignitaries 
and spouses. A member of the Marine band played the piano as the 
guests dined. 
</P>
<P>
	Dessert, officially titled ``A Salute to NATO,'' featured  
strawberry nougat glace, passion fruit truile and, of course, 
champagne. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last 50 years all of us have become more and more  
involved with events beyond our borders because we have seen how 
they affect the events within our borders,'' Clinton said in a 
pre-dinner toast. 
</P>
<P>
	In his toast, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said the  
leaders ``are going to live difficult moments, but we are going to 
win, there's no question of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opera star Jessye Norman had the weighty task of entertaining  
the 19 heads of state. With an audience as diverse as this one, 
opera music was a logical choice to bridge cultural differences 
with an American flavor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think classical music is always correct,'' said Selwa  
``Lucky'' Roosevelt, former chief of protocol. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials had warned in advance that some of the celebratory  
atmosphere would be dampened because of the military action in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that we've tried very, very hard -- at least I know on  
the government side -- we have toned our things to where they're 
dinners, and we're really not having a party,'' said Ms. French. 
</P>
<P>
	Party or not, the White House pulled out its opulent vermeil  
flatware and Truman china for the dinner. Flowers of lush green 
grapes and limes, white roses and orchids bedecked the table with 
white gardenias sprinkled alongside. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jobless Rate Rises in Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's jobless rate rose to 2.8 percent  
in March, up from February's 2.7 percent, despite forecasts of a 
rebounding economy, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 unemployment rate is expected to range between 2.75 and  
2.8 percent, up from 2.69 percent in 1998, said the Directorate 
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of the unemployed came to 271,000, including 97,000  
who lost their jobs because of factory or company closures, the 
agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor participation rate dropped to 57.6 percent -- the lowest in  
17 years -- because many people gave up looking for jobs in the 
sluggish job market. 
</P>
<P>
	The lackluster real estate and banking sectors have contributed  
to the rising jobless rate despite government efforts to prop them 
up with low-interest mortgages and tax reductions, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the real estate sector, officials said, employment dropped by  
15,000 people and workers took pay cuts averaging 6 percent in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	Affected by the regional financial crisis, Taiwan's economic  
growth rate dropped to 4.8 percent last year, the lowest in 16 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	But an improved trade performance is expected to bolster the  
economy. The government has forecast a 4.7 percent growth this year 
and a growth of 5.9 percent next year.

<HEADLINE> Bank Sues Robbers' Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The parents of seven teen-agers accused of  
stealing $90,400 in a suburban bank heist are being sued by the 
bank for the loot and $100,000 in damages and fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are responsible just like all of us who are parents,''  
David Creel, senior vice president of TCF Bank, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	No one is claiming the parents took any of the money or even  
knew anything about the Feb. 15 robbery at the bank branch in 
Naperville, where some of the teens were employees. Half of the 
money is still missing. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed under the Illinois parental responsibility  
law, which is most often used to collect from parents whose 
offspring have caused damage through carelessness or mischief, such 
as an out-of-control house party that damages a neighbor's home. 
</P>
<P>
	``This extends it from sort of negligent accidents to willful  
injuries. It's a plausible theory,'' said Harold Krent, a professor 
at the Chicago-Kent College of Law. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the heist was engineered by former bank manager  
Terry Twist, 25, who is now in custody. An 18-year-old woman who 
worked in the bank has pleaded guilty to misapplying bank funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Four 16-year-olds have been charged as juveniles, and two  
17-year-olds face adult charges. Some are accused of hiding the 
loot or driving cars in the plot, which unraveled after a few days 
when some of the teens allegedly used the money to buy televisions, 
video games and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Stone, a lawyer for one of the families, said Twist led  
the teen-agers astray. Twist had had some brushes with the law but 
no convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``In suing the parents, the bank seems to have forgotten its own  
role in this sad matter by hiring Terry Twist and allowing him to 
play the role of Fagin and capture the hearts and minds of 
children,'' Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The children are responsible, but it's bizarre to contend that  
the parents who did not work at the bank are responsible.''

<HEADLINE> Sonia Gandhi Doesn't Win Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Sonia Gandhi vowed to continue talks to  
block the Hindu nationalist government from returning to power 
after her Congress Party fell short of the support needed to form a 
new Indian government today. 
</P>
<P>
	Early elections appeared likely, although all parties said they  
wanted to avoid a third round of voting in as many years. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi, favored by the Congress Party to be the country's  
next prime minister, was unable to win support from a majority in 
parliament when Mulayam Singh Yadav, head of the socialist 
Samajwadi Party, said he would not support either of the major 
blocs trying to cobble together a new government. His party 
controls 20 of the 543 seats in parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi's Italian heritage and lack of political experience  
have been points of contention for some of Congress' potential 
backers, as well as its opponents. The widow of Prime Minister 
Rajiv Gandhi, she adopted Indian citizenship 16 years after her 
marriage and entered politics last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rajiv Gandhi, who was prime minister until 1989, was  
assassinated in 1991. His mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was 
assassinated in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	After a meeting with India's president, Mrs. Gandhi, 52, said  
she would consider options other than leading a minority 
Congress-only government, including a coalition government led by 
someone else. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she had the support of 233 members of parliament for a  
Congress government, 39 less than she claimed to have two days ago 
when she told President K.R. Narayanan she would assemble a 
majority by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, she indicated the president gave her more time. ``I  
have been told to do whatever we have to do as soon as possible,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first statement since the negotiations for an alternative  
government began, Narayanan said Friday he would soon decide about 
forming a new administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi said she would continue talking with the parties  
that banded together last Saturday to vote out Prime Minister Atal 
Bihari Vajpayee's party by a single ballot in a confidence vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Vajpayee's coalition, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, said if  
Congress failed to get a majority, the BJP should be able to try 
again because it remained the largest party in parliament. It 
claimed support from 270 members. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no need for fresh elections. We are already in the  
field,'' Vajpayee said after a meeting of the parliament members 
from his alliance. Officials said the members rejected Vajpayee's 
offer to step aside and allow someone else to lead a reconstituted 
government, reaffirming their support for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi, referring to the smaller parties that backed away  
from supporting her, said, ``It is also for the other side to see, 
to decide, how to see to it that the BJP government doesn't come 
back.''

<HEADLINE> Who Climbed Mount Everest First? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The last time climbers George Mallory and Andrew  
Irvine were seen, they were distant shadows creeping up Mount 
Everest's jagged North Side, 900 feet from the summit. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether they reached the top before disappearing in 1924 is the  
question driving a team of climbers on the face of the world's 
highest mountain today. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight climbers are looking for the bodies of the Englishmen  
and a camera that could contain pictures proving they reached the 
summit 29 years before Sir Edmund Hillary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say all of us feel we're taking part in a historical  
endeavor that's bigger than this climb,'' said Eric Simonson, 
speaking by satellite phone Friday from base camp in the Himalayas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mallory and Irvine are held in awe by many high-altitude  
climbers, given the rudimentary equipment used and the raw courage 
required for their early crack at Everest. The pair wore cotton 
shells and wool sweaters and jackets for the ascent, mere rags by 
today's standards. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar search for their bodies in 1986 failed, leaving one  
person dead. But Simonson, 43, likes the chances for his team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think we know where to look,'' he said. ``Obviously there's  
some luck involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The search is being funded by the Public Broadcasting Service  
for the documentary program NOVA, which is produced in Boston. NOVA 
is posting online updates throughout the expedition to the 
29,028-foot summit. 
</P>
<P>
	The climb, which began on March 29, is being made in six stages,  
and the team must be finished by early May's start of the monsoon 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the weather has been cooperative, said Simonson, a  
veteran Everest climber from Ashford, Wash. High winds combined 
with low precipitation have scoured the mountain clean, possibly 
exposing the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Simonson said the team expects to perform its first, cursory  
search next week. The mountaineers have targeted a search area 
based on calculations from Jochen Hemmleb, a 28-year-old German 
climber and Mallory historian. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thinks he knows where the body is,'' said NOVA producer  
Liesl Clark, 32, who's with the climbers. ``It's a little bit of a 
treasure hunt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hemmleb is basing his guess on a 1975 discovery by Chinese  
climber Wang Hongbao, who reported seeing a body on the North Ridge 
route Mallory and Irvine would have taken. Hongbao described the 
body as ``English Dead,'' and indicated its vintage clothing broke 
to pieces when he touched it. 
</P>
<P>
	The body was found on a snow terrace, just below the spot where  
an ice ax believed to be Irvine's was found in 1933. The ax had 
three notches on the handle, which was how Irvine marked his 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It raises the question of whether he fell,'' said NOVA  
producer Lauren Aguirre. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after Hongbao told his story in 1979, he died in an  
avalanche on Everest's North Face. But Hemmleb used information 
about Hongbao's climb to pinpoint the likely location of his camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Mallory took a Kodak Vest-Pocket camera with him before his  
final ascent, and likely took pictures if he reached the peak. 
Eastman Kodak Co. said if the film hasn't been exposed, it can 
still be developed. 
</P>
<P>
	The team has a metal detector to find the camera, but Clark  
called that ``a last resort,'' given the difficulty transporting it 
to such high altitudes. Mainly, she said, they'll use nothing more 
technically advanced than their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 people have died climbing Everest since 1953. Last  
week, a ninth member of Simonson's team dropped out due to altitude 
sickness. But the other climbers generally remain in good health. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of what's found, Clark said, Hillary's place in  
history is secure because he was the first to make it back from the 
top of Everest. 
</P>
<P>
	Mallory's place in history is also secure, if only for his  
memorable answer to the question of why he wanted to climb the 
world's highest peak: ``Because it is there.''

<HEADLINE> Witness in Microsoft Case Surprised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Experts following the Microsoft antitrust  
trial weren't the only ones surprised when the government initially 
chose as one of its witnesses a relatively unknown software 
engineer from Boeing Co. 
</P>
<P>
	New testimony released Thursday shows that the engineer himself  
was surprised to learn of his role in one of the most important 
business trials in a century. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Vesey said he realized he was on the witness list only  
after reading his name on the front page of his newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's lawyer, Tom Burt, apparently was so caught off-guard  
by the disclosure that he did a double-take during his interview of 
Vesey. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the day that the witness lists were published in the paper  
on a Saturday, did you say?'' Burt asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah,'' offered Vesey, who added that he spoke just twice  
weeks earlier by telephone to lawyers from the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Vesey's interview, from last September, was the first to be  
released from more than 90 interviews conducted for the trial. The 
others, including three days of interviews with Microsoft Chairman 
Bill Gates, were expected to be made public by the middle of next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court ruled earlier this year that an obscure  
1913 law allows the public to read the transcripts from those 
depositions, from some of the high-tech industry's most powerful 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling also ensured that the public can attend any future  
interviews with executives related to the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of those was scheduled for Wednesday in Washington,  
when Microsoft lawyers will question Netscape executive Peter 
Currie. America Online, the world's largest Internet provider, said 
it expects its chairman, Steve Case, to be questioned the first 
week of May. 
</P>
<P>
	Vesey, who decides which Internet software that most Boeing  
employees use, never actually testified at the Microsoft trial, 
despite originally being selected as a witness. The trial is 
currently in a lengthy recess but expected to resume in mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department, a month after it chose Vesey, replaced  
him and another witness, an economics expert, with executives from 
Apple Computer Co. and Sun Microsystems Inc. The government did 
show brief video excerpts during the trial of Vesey explaining why 
Boeing chose to use Netscape's browser, not Microsoft's. 
</P>
<P>
	Under rules to speed the trial, the judge limited the government  
and Microsoft to only a dozen witnesses each. That meant each 
choice carried important implications. 
</P>
<P>
	But the full transcript of Vesey's interview suggests why the  
government originally believed he might be a compelling witness 
against the software giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Vesey told lawyers, for example, that Boeing estimated a $5  
million savings by choosing to install a newer version of 
Netscape's software rather than also distributing Microsoft's rival 
Web software on its 170,000 personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	One core issue at the trial is whether Microsoft illegally  
forces customers of its dominant Windows operating system to use 
its Internet software, which is included within the most recent 
versions of Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges Microsoft ``tied'' the products in  
violation of federal antitrust law, discouraging consumers from 
using a rival's software that might perform redundant functions. 
Microsoft said it integrated Internet features into Windows to 
benefit customers.

<HEADLINE>  Hyundai To Pare Number of Divisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Under government pressure, heavily  
indebted Hyundai Group plans to reduce the number of its 
subsidiaries to 26 from 79 by 2003 through sales and mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest conglomerate said it would concentrate on  
five key sectors -- automobiles, shipbuilding, 
construction-engineering, electronics and finance. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai officials said today the conglomerate will eventually be  
broken into five groups to handle each of the core businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai, along with another conglomerate, Daewoo, has been under  
mounting government pressure to trim its business portfolio and 
narrow its focus. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo, the nation's second largest conglomerate, unveiled plans  
earlier this week to sell its shipbuilding and 25 other 
subsidiaries by October to improve its financial position and focus 
on carmaking and finance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The restructuring will completely change the face of  
Hyundai,'' Park Se-yong, head of the group's corporate 
restructuring committee, told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Also announced at the news conference was the conclusion of a  
deal that allows Hyundai to buy a computer memory chip-making arm 
of LG group for $2.13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, wrapped up late Thursday after months of negotiations,  
calls for Hyundai to pay LG Semicon $1.3 billion immediately and 
the remainder in five installments by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition will make Hyundai Electronics Co. the world's  
largest memory chip producer with an estimated 20.8 percent share 
of the world market. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai officials said the restructuring aims to reduce their  
group's total debt to $2.7 billion from $6.5 billion by the end of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of Hyundai subsidiaries to be sold, spun off or merged  
includes several profitable steel making, petrochemical and 
aluminum plants as well as smaller plants. 
</P>
<P>
	As in the case of Daewoo, Hyundai's plan drew applause from the  
government but skepticism from economists and analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts expressed doubt that Hyundai will be able to find  
buyers for its assets. They noted that most past promises by the 
nation's top conglomerates went unfulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of restructuring by Hyundai and Daewoo came  
days after President Kim Dae-jung urged vigorous corporate 
restructuring to improve efficiency and boost foreign investors' 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has focused his criticism on the country's top  
five conglomerates -- Daewoo, Hyundai, Samsung, LG and SK -- each of 
which controls 40 to 70 subsidiaries, making everything from 
computer chips to cars and ships. 
</P>
<P>
	When the economy slowed in 1996-1997, about a dozen  
conglomerates collapsed under their debt load, leaving banks with 
mounds of non-performing loans that caused a sudden loss of 
confidence and triggered a flight of foreign capital. 
</P>
<P>
	That forced South Korea to accept a record $58 billion bailout  
from the International Monetary Fund in late 1997. Structural 
economic reforms were a key condition of the rescue package. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Korean economy shrank 5.8 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Behind the Scenes at L!VE TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- L!VE TV often left its viewers to wonder whether  
it was serious. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable channel was notable for orange shoes, for mixing sex  
and baked beans, for the News Bunny, and for the minimally attired 
Norwegian-speaking women who took over the weather forecasts from 
dwarfs who needed a trampoline to reach the weather map. 
</P>
<P>
	It also pioneered ``Topless Darts,'' in which young women shed  
their top garments to play the game. 
</P>
<P>
	L!VE TV quickly proved itself a bit outre even by the standards  
of British media, which -- with girlie photos in daily tabloids and 
a TV series with explicit gay romance -- are more relaxed than in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Nudity, simulated sex acts, gay couples and foul language all  
became part of the prime-time package, and past 10 p.m. the 
channels become more daring with shows such as ``Eurotrash,'' a 
half-hour obsessed with bad music, enormous breasts and 
full-frontal views of full-gutted German naturists. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the scenes, however, was a big-money battle over rights  
to televise professional soccer. Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television 
had soccer on its satellite system, cable TV companies wanted it, 
and L!VE was the vehicle launched by the owners of the tabloid 
Daily Mirror to get it. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, there's no point bidding for broadcast rights if you  
can't broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just some crazy people throwing money down the drain  
because they're daft -- which, when you turned it on, was what it 
looked like,'' says Chris Horrie, co-author of ``L?VE TV: 
Tellybrats and Topless Darts,'' the newly published history of the 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mirror hoped to team up with the wealthy cable operators to  
outbid Sky for soccer. But, according to Horrie and co-author Adam 
Nathan, the cable operators and Sky reached an accommodation to 
avert a bidding war, leaving L!VE TV in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
	The channel's creators have all moved on, but L!VE TV survives,  
available to 2.7 million cable homes in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	The days of ``Topless Darts'' may be numbered, however. The  
parent Mirror Group is now the target of a takeover bid, and the 
Financial Times has reported that the group may shed its TV 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
	L!VE TV brought together two extraordinary characters: Janet  
Street-Porter, a tall, toothy woman with a knack for creating 
programs aimed at the young adult market; and Kelvin MacKenzie, 
Barnumesque former editor of The Sun, Murdoch's best-selling 
tabloid. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a shocking pairing. MacKenzie, in one of his cruel jokes,  
once ran pictures of Street-Porter and a horse side by side in The 
Sun and invited readers to vote on which was better looking. 
</P>
<P>
	MacKenzie and Street-Porter hardly agreed on anything, and L!VE  
TV betrayed some confusion in trying to follow conflicting leads. 
</P>
<P>
	Street-Porter's world was about fashion, dancing all night and  
wild colors. For L!VE TV, she converted the 24th floor of London's 
tallest skyscraper into ``The Entity,'' combining all the channel's 
operations in one wide-open space where talent and technicians 
roamed free in orange shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesdays and Fridays were ``love nights,'' with the emphasis on  
the physical (including the ``sploshers'' who heightened their 
desire by smearing themselves with baked beans). Saturday night was 
the time for the remote units to shine, covering the action in 
London's clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Street-Porter's mantra for L!VE was ``cheery, not sneery.'' But  
the reviews following the channel's debut on June 12, 1995, were 
sneery indeed. ``Can British TV sink even lower than this?'' The 
Guardian asked. 
</P>
<P>
	MacKenzie got his chance to try three months later, when  
Street-Porter quit. Out went the jazzy graphics, out went the 
orange shoes and out went quite a few employees. 
</P>
<P>
	MacKenzie's style, honed at The Sun, was to appeal to the lowest  
common denominator with naked girls and juvenile humor. 
</P>
<P>
	His attention-getting stunts at L!VE TV, conceived during what  
Horrie calls ``drink-filled brainstorming sessions,'' included the 
Norwegian-speaking weather girls; the News Bunny, which reacted to 
news items with a thumbs up or thumbs down; and a boxing match 
between Princess Diana and Queen Elizabeth II lookalikes. 
</P>
<P>
	A L!VE TV reporter was induced to legally change his name to  
News Bunny so he could run in a Parliamentary special election in 
1996. To avoid equal time rules, the channel renamed the rabbit Dr. 
News von Bunny and added a Hitler mustache. 
</P>
<P>
	That adventure ended with typical L!VE TV flair. News Bunny was  
arrested for obstructing traffic on election day, the channel's 
reporter took a nap and missed the announcement of election 
results, and N. Bunny finished ninth in a field of 13. 
</P>

	`JOAN' ON THE WEB: Another blow is struck for convergence  
between TV and the World Wide Web. ``Joan of Arc,'' which CBS calls 
its ``most ambitious mini-series ever,'' is being supported by the 
Official ``Joan of Arc'' Web site, already up on CBS (www.cbs.com), 
as well as a ``Joan of Arc'' site for America Online members 
(keyword: Joan) beginning May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sites give insight into the extraordinary production  
process of ``Joan of Arc'' as well as historical background on the 
Maid of Orleans. It airs May 16 and May 18, starring Leelee 
Sobieski as the illiterate French peasant girl in the early 1400s 
whose faith and courage unite France's army against its English 
enemy -- before she is charged with heresy and burned at the stake, 
at age 19.

<HEADLINE> Conoco Wants Office in Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Conoco Inc. has applied with the Saudi Arabian  
government for approval to open an office in Riyadh, the company 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign oil companies have been barred from exploration and  
production in the Middle East kingdom since it nationalized its oil 
industry in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the government began seeking outside investment again  
last year in the wake of low oil prices and growing competition 
from other producers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe it is time to establish an office in Saudi Arabia  
that can best support our pursuit of new business opportunities,'' 
Philip L. Frederickson, Conoco vice president of business 
development, said in a brief statement. Conoco hopes to open the 
office by the middle of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies that have shown interest in returning to Saudi  
Arabia have been Texaco Inc., Mobil Corp., Exxon Corp., Chevron 
Corp., Atlantic Richfield Co. and Phillips Petroleum Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco, Mobil, Exxon and Chevron were partners in the Arabian  
American Oil Co. -- known as Aramco -- in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia has the world's largest-known oil reserves -- more  
than 260 billion barrels -- and the lowest extraction costs. At 8 
million barrels a day, its oil production is second only to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Conoco is based in Houston.

<HEADLINE> Man Guilty in Pizza Delivery Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWTON, N.J. (AP) -- A 20-year-old man was convicted Friday of  
luring two pizza delivery men to an abandoned cabin and fatally 
shooting them. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Koskovich was convicted of murder, robbery, burglary,  
theft and weapons offenses for the April 19, 1997 killings of 
delivery man Jeremy Giordano and pizza shop owner Giorgio Gallara. 
He could be sentenced to death by injection. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury, which deliberated eight hours over two days before  
reaching a verdict, will begin considering his penalty Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Koskovich and Jayson Vreeland just wanted to  
see what it felt like to kill. Prosecutors said Koskovich carefully 
planned the shootings by taking guns out for target practice, and 
trying to recruit his friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the two called a half-dozen pizza parlors  
before finding one that would deliver to an abandoned cabin in 
rural northwestern New Jersey. The county has the state's lowest 
crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys argued that Koskovich was too drugged on  
prescription pain killers to know what he was doing, and that he 
only plotted to rob Giordano and pizza shop owner Giorgio Gallara. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from adjusting his chair in the courtroom, Koskovich did  
not react to the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he confessed, he reportedly refused offers to plead  
guilty to avoid the death penalty. Last summer, Koskovich attempted 
suicide in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Vreeland, 19, has not been tried yet. He does not face the death  
penalty because he was a juvenile at the time of the shooting.

<HEADLINE> GM Denies That Chairman Will Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. vice chairman Harry Pearce  
is disputing recent speculation that chairman Jack Smith will 
retire early and clear the way for Pearce to run the world's 
largest automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important that we put to rest a lot of the  
speculation that has arisen,'' Pearce said today. ``Jack Smith has 
done an extraordinary job leading the turnaround at General Motors. 
He's healthy, he's young -- and believe me, I view 61 as young these 
days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce, 56, recently returned to work full time after undergoing  
nearly a year of successful treatment for leukemia. His high 
profile in the past week, which has included a packed schedule of 
media interviews, has increased talk that Pearce is again being 
groomed to succeed Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce said GM's management team works well together.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're not running for each other's jobs and, quite frankly,  
that's not always the way it has been at GM,'' Pearce said during 
an interview with Detroit-based auto writers. ``It's an extremely 
healthy relationship. It's the way a large, complex company ought 
to be managed, and we all have plenty to do in our own respective 
jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when asked if he felt up to the task of running GM, Pearce  
said his health was not an issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I owe the company is 100 percent of my capability,'' he  
said. ``I owe the company what I hope I was delivering before all 
of this happened. The day that I believe I'm not delivering 100 
percent, I'll be on Jack's doorstep and on the door step of the 
board telling them I'm not up to the task anymore and I need to 
retire. I don't envision that happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce has said his battle with leukemia made him less  
egocentric and more willing to appreciate the importance of 
recognizing the contributions of others. He noted that he received 
words of support during his illness from UAW leaders, including 
president Stephen Yokich and vice president Richard Shoemaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``That support is something I will never forget,'' Pearce said.  
</P>
<P>
	His new attitude may also be reflected in GM's efforts to forge  
a more cooperative relationship with the United Auto Workers as the 
union and company prepare for triennial contract negotiations later 
this year. GM has had a far more contentious relationship with the 
UAW than Ford Motor Co. or DaimlerChrysler AG. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to work very hard on both sides of the table to  
develop a relationship based upon trust and mutual respect.'' 
Pearce said. ``We're in this business together, and our hourly 
workers are as important as our salaried workers. They all play a 
role in the ultimate success of the business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce has acknowledged that GM did not properly handle last  
year's dispute with the UAW in Flint, Mich., which led to two 
costly strikes that virtually shut down the company in North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to get away from the old confrontational days,'' he  
said. ``Strikes are a huge problem for the business, they're a 
problem for the country, they're a problem for our work force. They 
are destructive, they make no sense, and that is not the way we 
need to solve our problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce said GM will work for a new contract that treats both  
sides fairly, but ``ensures the future competitiveness of the 
company.'' The former trial lawyer also indicated that his new 
attitude doesn't mean he'll be a pushover. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you can be a kind and gentler person and still be a  
tough negotiator,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Officer Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- Air Force Capt. Joseph  
Belli pleaded guilty today to fraternization charges, stemming from 
an affair he had with an enlisted woman he later married. 
</P>
<P>
	Belli faces up to 27 years in federal prison. He pleaded guilty  
at the start of his court-martial today to all charges: 
fraternization, conspiracy and disobeying direct orders. A jury of 
military officers that is to decide his punishment will hear 
testimony today. 
</P>
<P>
	Belli allegedly began an affair with Airman Susan Redo when he  
was stationed at Diego Garcia Island in the Indian Ocean in 
November 1997, several months after his wife requested a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	Belli, 35, told his estranged wife about the affair when he  
returned to Travis last year, military officials said. She became 
angry and notified his commanding officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges are based on the relationship continuing after Belli  
was ordered by his commanding officer to end the affair. Air Force 
officials accused Belli of asking his wife and Ms. Redo, who is in 
her early 20s, to lie about the affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Belli pleaded guilty through his attorney, John Hodson, after  
giving crisp ``yes'' and ``no'' answers to questions by the 
military judge, Air Force Col. Pat Sweeney. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courtroom today, Belli's mother said the charges  
were unfounded and denounced the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
	``His crime was falling in love,'' said Carolyn Belli. ``The  
message the Air Force gives is, 'It's okay to lie, it's okay to 
cheat. If you get caught, just don't tell the truth,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Redo will not be prosecuted because the military assumes an  
officer is in control in such a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Belli had asked permission to resign from the military instead  
of facing charges, the option offered to Air Force Lt. Kelly Flinn. 
She gained national attention in 1997 because of her affair with 
the husband of an enlisted woman. 
</P>
<P>
	But Belli was turned down in December by acting Air Force  
Secretary F. Whitten Peters, who said the request was 
inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	Belli's first wife, Kelly Belli, reported the affair hoping she  
would force him to end the relationship. The next day, Mrs. Belli 
called back to ask the commanding officer to not intervene, saying 
she didn't want to get her husband in trouble.

<HEADLINE> Suits Filed Over Turnpike Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four young men who were shot at 11 times by New  
Jersey troopers after a traffic stop were handcuffed, forced to lie 
in a ditch and strip-searched before paramedics were allowed to 
help them, new lawsuits say. 
</P>
<P>
	Four civil rights and injury lawsuits were filed Thursday by  
former O.J. Simpson attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. on behalf of the 
three black men and one Hispanic man. 
</P>
<P>
	The case, involving two white troopers, has drawn national  
attention to the practice of ``racial profiling,'' or targeting of 
minorities, for traffic stops. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the men, Rayshawn Brown, 21, and Leroy Grant, 24, were  
asleep in the van when the troopers' bullets struck them April 23, 
1998, on the New Jersey Turnpike, according to the lawsuits. A 
third man, Danny Reyes, 21, was raising his hands and pleading not 
to be shot when Trooper James Kenna opened fire, the suits alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	The troopers said the van backed up in an attempt to hit them.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think this case is a catalyst more than anything else,''  
Cochran said at a New York City news conference. The suits were 
filed in state court in Trenton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The Black Ministers Council of New Jersey scheduled a protest  
rally in Trenton, N.J., to mark the anniversary of the shooting 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the New Jersey attorney general's office has issued a  
report confirming the existence of so-called racial profiling of 
minority motorists, Grant said New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman 
owes him something. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a parent, not as a political leader but that as a parent,  
why doesn't she come forward and give an apology for what had 
happened, knowing that racial profiling did exist all these years 
but was ignored,'' Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, Reyes and Brown still have bullets lodged in their bodies  
because it was medically unwise to remove them, the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a hard-fought year for all four of us,'' Grant  
said. ``We don't know why we got shot. We still don't know why the 
van got stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two troopers involved were indicted Monday on charges of  
falsifying traffic stop records to cover up the fact that they were 
stopping and searching mostly black motorists. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges were not directly related to the shooting.

<HEADLINE> Jays Eye NY Billionaire As Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Toronto Blue Jays are talking to billionaire  
Howard Milstein about the New York real estate magnate becoming a 
partner in the baseball club, a spokesman for Labatt Breweries said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The discussions with Mr. Milstein have been very  
preliminary,'' said James Villeneuve, director of public affairs 
for Labatt. ``There's currently no deal in place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Post reported Friday that Labatt would give  
Milstein controlling interest by selling 50 percent of the team to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage, that is very premature to be running that  
number,'' said Villeneuve. 
</P>
<P>
	Villeneuve said the ball team is not for sale, but that Labatt  
is looking to raise money through new partnerships. The brewery 
recently sold Toronto's SkyDome stadium, where the Blue Jays play. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're always hoping to look into equity partners, and we have  
always said that, to keep the team strong and have continued 
viability for Toronto,'' said Villeneuve. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue Jays vice president Bob Nicholson doesn't believe a new  
partner in the ball club would significantly change the operations 
of the club or indicate a relocation is in store. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suppose anything can happen, but certainly my understanding  
is that initial discussions are really to bring a partner into the 
business,'' said Nicholson. ``I don't anticipate that there's any 
change in the operations of the club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays are 90 percent owned by Labatt Breweries which, in  
turn, is owned by the Belgian company Interbrew, with the Canadian 
Imperial Bank of Commerce holding the other 10 percent. The Blue 
team was for sale for almost two years, but was taken off the 
market in the fall of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein, a co-owner of the NHL's New York Islanders, lost out  
in the bidding for the NFL's Cleveland Browns in 1998. He withdrew 
his bid for the Washington Redskins earlier this month when it 
became apparent NFL owners would not approve his $800 million 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue Jays chairman Allen Chapin is a senior partner in the law  
firm Sullivan and Cromwell in New York, which does some work for 
the Milstein family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Milstein and Mr. Chapin are acquainted with each other,''  
said Villeneuve. ``They would talk about a whole host of business 
ideas. I'm sure this is one of them that came up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein, 47, bought the Islanders for $195 million in February  
1998.

<HEADLINE> Reds Happy With Wohlers' Workout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Mark Wohlers threw to batters for the first  
time Friday since being traded to the Cincinnati Reds a week ago 
and being placed on the 15-day DL with ``anxiety disorder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he made a lot of progress today,'' pitching coach Don  
Gullett said. ``The more he threw, the better he got. It was 
certainly a step in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, 29, set an Atlanta Braves record with 39 saves in 1996,  
and had 33 the following season. But last year, he was sent to 
Triple-A Richmond twice when his control deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the season -- after he pulled a muscle in his side,  
his wife filed for divorce and his mother suffered a heart attack -- 
his confidence was shot. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw well in spring training, but not in two brief  
appearances in the regular season. When he refused to be demoted 
again, general manager Jim Bowden took him as a mental reclamation 
project -- with the Braves agreeing to pay his $5.2 million salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Reds manager Jack McKeon believes Wohlers' problem was not  
entirely mental. He credits Gullett with finding a mechanical flaw 
in his delivery that was easily corrected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not an expert, but I think a lot of times mechanical  
things -- if they screw you up enough -- can make you mental, too,'' 
McKeon said. ``I've seen a great deal of consistency in his 
delivery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates Chris Stynes, a right-hander, and Michael Tucker, a  
left-handed batter, volunteered to stand in against Wohlers on 
Friday. They alternated, as Wohlers threw about 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first I was a little nervous,'' Wohlers said. ``It's a big  
difference throwing out here than throwing in the bullpen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He thought he had pretty good control of all three pitches --  
fastball, split-finger and slider -- but wouldn't speculate when he 
might be activated. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a plan, and so far it's been working well,'' Wohlers  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gullett said Wohlers will face friendly batters again Tuesday in  
Philadelphia and gradually increase the number of pitches he 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
	Also undetermined is how much time Wohlers will spend with  
Triple-A Indianapolis, and what his role will be when he returns. 
But he probably won't a closer anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way you're going to get confidence back is to have  
some success,'' Gullett said, implying middle relief or setup duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers would be eligible to come off the DL a week from Sunday  
when the Reds wrap up a series in Atlanta. But Wohlers said that 
would be a bad idea even though he thinks he's close to being 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think I was that far off when I got designated (for  
minor league assignment) by Atlanta,'' Wohlers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I would have given me more than two opportunities,  
considering how far I had come and how long I had been in the 
organization.''

<HEADLINE> Prisoner Waits on Calif. Death Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN QUENTIN, Calif. (AP) -- Manny Babbitt knows what's coming:  
Unless one man intervenes, he will begin the day after his 50th 
birthday lying on a gurney, his arms stretched wide with a needle 
feeding poison into his veins. 
</P>
<P>
	He tries not to think about it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I put all of the feelings that'll bring sadness around me  
aside. There's plenty of time for that later,'' he said Thursday in 
an interview at San Quentin State Prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to make things as pleasant as possible for those around  
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means shining other inmates' shoes, cooking with a small  
handheld element and not overstepping his telephone privileges. It 
also means not serving as a reminder of how inmates exit death row. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys start feeling uncomfortable. They avert their eyes as  
you're walking down the tier,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring a reprieve from Gov. Gray Davis, Babbitt will be  
executed May 4 for killing Leah Schendel. He broke into her 
Sacramento apartment in December 1980 and hammered her with punches 
that broke her dentures and split the skin on her forehead to the 
bone. She didn't die of the blows; her 78-year-old heart gave out 
under the shock and terror. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt's lawyers say he was not responsible for the attack.  
They say he was suffering from shellshock and thought he was back 
on the battlefields of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt, who received the Purple Heart while on death row, was  
in the 77-day siege of Khe Sanh, one of the war's bloodiest 
battles. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt says he doesn't remember the attacks, which means he  
doesn't remember the flashbacks. He says he doesn't like to blame 
post-traumatic stress syndrome, but thinks he might have a ``brain 
chemical imbalance, maybe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't put a lot of stock in psychiatrists. But he agrees  
that Khe Sanh changed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made a ... teen-ager into a person who has a side of him  
that he didn't understand at the time -- anxiousness and a sadness 
that was even sadder than it was before he got there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt recalled loading shells filled with thousands of darts.  
``A bunch of little tiny nails hit little tiny humans and all the 
humans fell. There'd be nothing but blood and guts on the landscape 
and that was the kind of things I had to look at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back home, Babbitt sometimes would wear combat fatigues and  
crouch in the streets of Providence, R.I., like a soldier 
patrolling the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't remember that, but he knows that when he came back,  
``People didn't recognize what my problem was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in the regulation short-sleeved prison shirt, Babbitt  
was resolutely upbeat as he spoke to reporters, sometimes launching 
into rambling discourses on his past. He took frequent sips from a 
plastic cup of water, saying he's dehydrated from taking pills for 
various ailments -- and from crying. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why, he paused for a minute, then said, ``Why do you  
cry?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He knows Mrs. Schendel's family wants him dead. He asked his  
brother to send a letter of apology to the dead woman's 
granddaughter because ``coming from me she may just rip it up.''

	School Shooting Clues Probed  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Security cameras in the Colorado high  
school where two young gunmen went on a shooting spree just may 
hold the answers to a few questions that police have, like whether 
others were involved. Gov. Bill Owens, who toured Columbine High 
School, the site of the shooting, said it was all but certain that 
the pair of young gunmen had help. Investigators were interviewing 
surviving members of the Trenchcoat Mafia. Officials also were 
trying to trace the weapons the two teen-agers used to kill 13 
people and then themselves. Meanwhile, hundreds attended the first 
memorial service for one of the victims.

	NATO Summit Warns Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Western leaders transformed a 50th anniversary  
celebration of NATO into a war summit Friday, pledging to intensify 
military strikes against Yugoslavia. They vowed ``no compromise'' 
on demands that Slobodan Milosevic withdraw his troops from Kosovo. 
``When we fight, we fight to prevail,'' President Clinton declared. 
Leaders of 19 nations pledged that the 1.4 million ethnic Albanian 
refugees forced from their homes will be able to return to ``live 
in peace and security.''

	UN-Kosovo Resolution Being Drafted  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Responding to NATO, the United States  
began drafting a U.N. Security Council resolution Friday calling 
for the demilitarization of Kosovo and an international military 
force to safeguard refugees, a U.S. official said. The decision by 
NATO leaders was to seek a U.N. council resolution, essentially 
outlining their demands for a halt to the bombing of Yugoslavia. 
Several Western diplomats indicated a resolution will not be put 
before the council until there is some indication from Yugoslavia 
that it will be helpful in achieving an end to the conflict, and 
from Russia that it won't be vetoed.

said after two hours of talks with Arafat in the West Bank town of 
Ramallah. Later, in Cairo, he held talks with Egyptian Foreign

	MIAMI (AP) -- Gov. Jeb Bush asked President Clinton to declare an  
emergency in 67 counties, with Florida wildfires on pace to sear 
through more than the 500,000 acres burned up last year. Bush 
requested that federal funds be made available to the counties 
because the fires that have burned more than 240,000 acres this 
year will likely continue until the state gets much-needed rain. 
``As of this date last year, only 9,000 acres in Florida had 
burned,'' Bush wrote in the request.

more than halved an earlier 80-point loss. On the NYSE, gainers led

eighth place, the last playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.

<HEADLINE> Capitol Suspect Ruled Incompetent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The man accused of slaying two Capitol Hill  
police officers is not competent to stand trial, a federal judge 
has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Eugene Weston Jr. told a psychiatrist appointed by the  
court that he opened fire in the Capitol last summer because he was 
after ``the ruby satellite,'' a device he said was kept in a Senate 
safe and is key to ending cannibalism, the Washington Post reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	According to unsealed court records cited by the Post, Weston  
fatally shot the two officers because he believed they were 
cannibals intent on keeping him from the satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan ordered the Federal  
Bureau of Prisons to place Weston, 42, in a facility that offers 
mental health services for a ``reasonable period of time, not to 
exceed four months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan set a conference for Sept. 9 to evaluate Weston's  
treatment and its effect on his competency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russell Eugene Weston Jr. presently suffers from a mental  
disease or defect that renders him incapable of understanding the 
nature and consequences of the proceedings against him,'' Sullivan 
said. The judge also said Weston is unable to aid in his own 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's absolutely correct,'' said Weston's attorney, A.J.  
Kramer. ``You can't have a rational conversation with him about the 
case. He's totally delusional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weston is charged with murdering Capitol Police officers John M.  
Gibson and Jacob J. Chestnut in the Capitol on July 24, 1998. He 
has not entered a plea. 
</P>
<P>
	Prison officials did not say where Weston would be placed.  
</P>
<P>
	The bureau operates five prisons with psychiatric facilities for  
men. 
</P>
<P>
	Court documents unsealed Thursday by the judge showed that  
psychiatrist Sally C. Johnson believed Weston was a paranoid 
schizophrenic and not competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``He believes that he is the commander in chief of the Armed  
Forces ... in control of time and time reversal, a brilliant 
scientist, and that he had a special relationship with President 
Kennedy,'' Johnson wrote in her evaluation. But she did not rule 
out the possibility that Weston could stand trial after he receives 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had intended to challenge Johnson's competency  
evaluation but, earlier this month, dropped their challenge after 
Weston refused to meet with other doctors.

<HEADLINE> Lazard Freres Agrees To Pay $11M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Investment bank Lazard Freres &AMP; Co. has agreed  
to pay $11 million to settle charges of price-gouging and fraud in 
the municipal bond market, three U.S. agencies announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the accord, Lazard will pay some $7.4 million to the  
federal government and a total of $3.5 million to the Passaic 
Valley Sewerage Commissioners in New Jersey and to Pittsburgh, 
Seattle and Indianapolis -- the bond issuers which Lazard allegedly 
overcharged for U.S. Treasury securities in 1992-93 in a practice 
known as ``yield burning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commisssion,  
Lazard also agreed to be censured and to refrain from future 
violations of the securities laws. The firm neither admitted to nor 
denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is another important step in our continuing effort to  
clean up the municipal securities market,'' SEC Chairman Arthur 
Levitt said. ``The practices identified in today's action harmed 
investors, issuers of municipal securities and the federal 
government. ... I expect other firms that engaged in these 
practices will also take responsibility and offer similar 
resolutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said its investigation of yield burning by other firms  
is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related action, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District  
of New York, Mary Jo White, and the Treasury Department said they 
had intervened in and settled a civil suit brought by a 
whistleblower against Lazard under the False Claims Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit had been filed in federal court in Manhattan by Michael  
Lissack, a former managing director of Smith Barney Inc., who 
brought several cases involving alleged yield burning by Lazard and 
other firms to public attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazard, in a statement Thursday, said ``We are especially  
pleased to have finally resolved this matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it shut down its municipal finance department  
in 1995 and has cooperated with the government's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Lazard agreed to pay the Los Angeles County  
Metropolitan Transportation Authority $9 million to settle state 
charges of yield burning. 
</P>
<P>
	The accord announced Thursday was the federal government's  
second big settlement of claims related to yield burning in the 
municipal bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, CoreStates Financial Corp. agreed to pay $3.7  
million to settle similar charges. The allegations concerned 
transactions by CoreStates' brokerage operation for municipal bond 
issuers in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, including school 
districts and other municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia-based CoreStates neither admitted nor denied  
wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement. The company was acquired 
by banking giant First Union Corp. in a $16.6 billion merger last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's cases against Lazard and CoreStates involved  
allegations of yield burning, a form of price-gouging most often 
involving so-called advance refunding bonds. When interest rates 
fall, municipal agencies sell those bonds to refinance older bonds 
previously issued at a higher rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond-issuing agency uses the proceeds of the new issue to  
buy Treasury securities, which temporarily are held in an escrow 
account. The U.S. securities are sold when the time comes to pay 
off the old high-rate tax-exempt bonds being refinanced. 
</P>
<P>
	If the municipal agency makes a profit by buying and selling  
Treasury securities with the proceeds from a tax-exempt issue, it 
must pay the profit to the IRS. The rule is designed to prevent 
agencies from abusing their tax-exempt status. 
</P>
<P>
	In yield burning, the brokerage firm handling the Treasury  
securities for the municipal agency uses fees and other devices to 
siphon off the profit that would otherwise go to the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the SEC said the $3.5 million to be paid by  
Lazard to the municipalities would be divided as follows: 
</P>
<P>
	--Passaic Valley Sewerage Commissioners, $447,374.  
</P>
<P>
	--Pittsburgh, $305,421.  
</P>
<P>
	--Seattle, $1.35 million.  
</P>
<P>
	--Indianapolis, $218,240, and Indianapolis Public Improvement  
Bond Bank, $1.22 million. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the settlement, the Internal Revenue Service agreed  
not to challenge the tax-exempt status of the bonds issued by the 
municipalities.

<HEADLINE>  High Security, Protests Greet NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chanting ``Bomb, NATO, bomb,'' more than 400  
Albanian-Americans protesters urged the alliance today to escalate 
the military action in Yugoslavia and help their beleaguered 
kinfolk return to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters draped themselves in the red and black flag of  
Albania and shouted anti-Serbian slogans in Lafayette Park, across 
the street from the White House, and several blocks from where 
NATO's leaders were meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	They had a mixed message for NATO: gratitude for the NATO  
bombing campaign against the Serb forces of Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic and anger that no ground troops have been 
deployed nor weapons sent to the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is helping but they are falling far short of what is  
needed,'' said Avni Mustafaj, president of the National Albanian 
American Council. ``While NATO is celebrating its anniversary, it 
should be ashamed for allowing the slaughter of children in 
Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Steinbaum, legislative director for Rep. Eliot Engel,  
D-N.Y., told the crowd he saw similarities between the Yugoslav 
drive to remove ethnic Albanians from Kosovo and the banishment of 
Jews by Nazi troops in the 1930s. He called on the crowd to visit 
congressional leaders to voice their outrage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come into our offices and tell us why we need a free Kosovo,''  
Steinbaum said. ``It's in your hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A protest march organized by a Washington-area Serbian church  
against the bombing was scheduled for the same park Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mustafaj said he didn't expect his group to conduct any  
counter-demonstrations Saturday, but added: ``If members of our 
community want to come and make their voices heard, I will not stop 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday at the Washington Monument, dozens of protesters  
organized by the Fourth Freedom Forum and the Citizens' Summit to 
De-Nuke NATO demonstrated against nuclear weapons and the NATO 
airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our focus is the present nuclear dilemma facing the world,''  
said Alistair Miller, director of the Fourth Freedom Forum's 
Washington office. ``NATO's nuclear weapons were introduced decades 
ago to counter a perceived threat that no longer exists.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up vs. Euro, Down vs. Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the euro Friday  
as a peace plan for Yugoslavia was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0605, down  
from $1.0614 late Thursday. The dollar was worth 119.41 Japanese 
yen, down from 119.52 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders had been selling dollars and buying euros as news  
reports surfaced that a peace settlement was being arranged by 
Russia for Yugoslavia, where NATO entered its 31st day of bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	But NATO rejected the deal as insufficient since Belgrade  
refused to accept a NATO-led military force to enforce the peace. 
</P>
<P>
	John Beerling, chief dealer at Norwest Bank Corp. in  
Minneapolis, said a settlement ``takes the premium out of the 
dollar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.5104 Swiss francs, up from 1.5084,  
and 1.4753 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4793. The British pound 
was quoted at $1.6150, up from $1.6139. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro no  
longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on the euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8443 German 
marks, up from 1.8426; and was unchanged at 6.1805 French francs 
and 1,824.82 Italian lire.

<HEADLINE>  Police Obtain School Security Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Surveillance tapes from the security  
cameras at Columbine High may show whether the two gunmen who died 
in the school bloodbath had accomplices, investigators said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The center of the slaughter -- the second-story library, where  
nearly all of the dead were found -- had no cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are also interviewing surviving members of the  
Trenchcoat Mafia to learn whether others had a role in the attack, 
and are trying to trace the shotguns and semiautomatic weapons the 
two teen-agers used to kill 13 people and then themselves on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Focusing on the theory that Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold,  
17, had help in building their arsenal and bringing their bombs and 
guns to school, investigators will be reviewing tapes from the 
security cameras mounted around the school, said sheriff's Lt. John 
Kiekbusch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ideally they would show the movement and also the actual  
placement perhaps of some of the explosive devices, prior to the 
incident,'' Kiekbusch said. ``If that's the case, we have got just 
very important evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They are time-lapse cameras, meaning they periodically take  
pictures instead of running continuously. Each tape goes back about 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said the tapes have not yet been  
viewed. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have also interviewed at least 500 people,  
including friends, students and teachers. They are especially 
interested in members of Trenchcoat Mafia, a group of outcasts who 
wore black. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we know someone who either professes to be a part of that  
group or someone else who can tell us they are a part of that 
group, you bet we'd like to talk to them, probably more than 
anyone,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County Sheriff's Lt. Dave Taylor said investigators  
have not identified a specific third suspect. ``We are doing an 
ongoing investigation. There are a lot of names coming up,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another key area is tracing the guns: two sawed-off shotguns, a  
9 mm carbine rifle and a TEC DC-9 semiautomatic pistol, a modified 
version of the now-banned TEC-9 assault weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Bettendorf, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol,  
Tobacco and Firearms, said it will be difficult to trace the 
weapons. ``These weapons were originally purchased in the late 
1960s or early 1970s, and there is no indication they belong to the 
parents,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettendorf said investigators are still trying to figure out how  
a large propane tank bomb was placed in the school's kitchen. 
Authorities found it Thursday as they swept the school. ``That's 
the question everybody is asking,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys also packed the big pockets in their utility pants with  
ammunition and used pipe bombs stuffed with nails and BBs as 
shrapnel. District Attorney Dave Thomas said most of the explosive 
devices found in the school were made from readily available 
household items. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, more than 900 mourners gathered at Foothills Bible  
Church for the first of many memorial services expected through the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The service was held for 16-year-old John Tomlin, who worked  
after school in a gardening store, belonged to a church youth group 
and went on a missionary trip to Mexico. He will be buried in 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Schools are disintegrating, partly because prayer has been  
removed from them,'' said the boy's mother, Doreen Tomlin. Asked 
whether the school system had failed, the boy's father, John, said: 
``The only system that has failed is that God is left out of 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two fellow members of the Trenchcoat Mafia apologized to  
families and friends of the victims on Wednesday. ``There was no 
sign they would do this,'' sobbed Nicole Makham. ``We would just 
like to say that we're sorry for what they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A makeshift memorial to the victims near Columbine has continued  
to grow steadily, with hundreds of flower bouquets, stuffed 
animals, signs and cards. One sign contained images of children's 
hands in fingerpaint with children's names on them. Another said: 
``Silence contributes to moral decay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine students will return to classrooms, though not their  
own, next Thursday. Columbine students, staff and faculty will 
share nearby Chatfield High School, with Columbine classes taking 
place in an afternoon split session.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Demonstrators with strongly divergent views  
over the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia rallied today as the 
alliance opened its 50th anniversary celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Albanian-American Council received a permit for a  
rally at Lafayette Park today in support of widening the NATO 
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thank NATO for getting involved, but we are asking them to  
do much, much more,'' said Ilir Zherka, the council's executive 
director. ``While NATO is patting itself on the back this week, 
people are dying in Kosovo and they can't stop it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Washington Monument, dozens of protesters organized by  
the Fourth Freedom Forum opposed the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our focus is the present nuclear dilemma facing the world,''  
said Alisair Miller, director of the group's Washington office. 
``NATO's nuclear weapons were introduced decades ago to counter a 
perceived threat that no longer exists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said he feared that potential protesters were scared away  
because of reports about the tight security imposed in Washington 
because of the summit. 
</P>
<P>
	A local Serbian church organized a protest for Saturday calling  
for an end to the bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are protesting the bombing because we consider it illegal  
and civilian people are being killed,'' said Zoran Hodjera, 
congregation president of St. Luke Serbian Orthodox Church in 
Washington, which is organizing the rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodjera, the Serbian Orthodox church official, said any  
atrocities against ethnic Albanians that the Serb-led government 
are accused of were brought on by the bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the bombing, we had only minor problems,'' Hodjera  
said. ``We never had any true negotiations between the parties. 
That avenue was never pursued properly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Park Police officials said permits were given to the three  
groups for summit-related protests. 
</P>
<P>
	The protests struck a sobering note during what has been planned  
as the largest gathering of foreign leaders ever to visit 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in a city well accustomed to the high security measures  
accorded important guests, the safety measures surrounding the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit are bringing together 18 
law enforcement agencies, led by the Secret Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Just because there have been no credible threats of terrorist  
attack so far ``doesn't mean that in any way our vigilance is low 
or that our guard is not up,'' said Deputy Attorney General Eric 
Holder said. ``We are prepared for just about anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the three days of the meeting, downtown Washington has  
become one big high-security area for dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal workers in the city's core around the White House were  
excused from work Friday. Many private businesses followed the 
government's lead. Vehicle and pedestrian traffic will be blocked 
in the vicinity of the summit headquarters through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents of Washington D.C. school students received letters this  
week notifying them schools would be closed Friday and all athletic 
events scheduled for Friday, Saturday and Sunday would be canceled 
and rescheduled for a later date.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Teachers Walk Off Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Teachers from Seattle and several other school  
districts walked off the job in protest of pay raises that they say 
don't account for years of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers walked out Thursday and called on legislators to  
work out a satisfactory plan. 
</P>
<P>
	About 5,000 gathered at Safeco Field, a new baseball stadium  
under construction that was made possible after the Legislature 
called a special session to craft a public-private financing 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know what the Legislature can do when it puts its mind  
to it,'' elementary school teacher Charles Hasse, a member of the 
board of the National Education Association, told the gathering. 
``We are standing in front of monuments to what they can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the rally, the teachers boarded about 80 buses for a  
caravan to Olympia to lobby the Legislature for a 15 percent pay 
raise -- the amount of buying power teachers say they've lost to 
inflation in the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of about 10,000 teachers walked off the job in 12 school  
districts around the state, said Rich Wood, spokesman for the 
Washington Education Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers statewide have staged one-day walkouts and several  
rallies in Olympia over the past several weeks to push for salary 
increases. There's been no talk of lengthy teacher work stoppages 
beyond the one-day protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle is the state's largest district, with about 3,200  
teachers and some 47,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
	Salaries for starting teachers in Washington are about $23,000 a  
year, and go up to about $50,000 for veteran teachers with advanced 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Gov. Gary Locke nor the Legislature is proposing  
anywhere near the 15 percent figure.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 41 on Profit Taking / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fell today, pulling back in  
profit-taking after a three-day rally. Concerns about AT&AMP;T's bid 
for cable operator MediaOne also affected trading. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 41.52 at 10,685.66 after closing up 145 points Thursday at 
10,727.18, its 10th record high close in 14 sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also declined today.  
</P>
<P>
	``The market is certainly overdue for a pause to refresh,'' said  
Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; 
Sons Inc. in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even bull markets have to rest their engines,'' he said.  
``That's all today is -- a chance to catch our breath and look at 
how strong this market has been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, a Dow component, fell after news of its $58 billion  
hostile bid for MediaOne, the nation's fourth-largest cable 
operator. AT&AMP;T is trying to thwart a merger agreement reached last 
month between MediaOne and No. 3 cable television company Comcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors worry that the deal could hurt AT&AMP;T's earnings.  
</P>
<P>
	``This deal spooks the market a little bit because AT&AMP;T has been  
one of the better performing stocks and there is concern about how 
this will affect it,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief investment 
strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co., in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think fundamentally this positions AT&AMP;T tremendously for the  
longer term,'' he said. ``Today, we are seeing a knee-jerk 
reaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T was down 3 3/16 at 53 9/16. MediaOne was up 7 3/8 at 76 7/8.  
</P>
<P>
	A pullback in technology stocks also contributed to the weakness  
on Wall Street. After a fierce selloff on Monday, technology shares 
soared over the last three days, prompting investors to collect 
some of their profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 5.21 at  
2,556.40. The Nasdaq fell 138 points on Monday, but climbed 216 
points in the last three days. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 342.69 million 
shares, down from 427.89 million shares on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 7.84 at 1,350.98, the  
NYSE composite index was down 2.78 at 638.19, and the American 
Stock Exchange composite index was up 5.60 at 763.98.

<HEADLINE>  High Security, Protests Greet NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chanting ``Bomb, NATO, bomb,'' more than 400  
Albanian-Americans protesters urged the alliance today to escalate 
the military action in Yugoslavia and help their beleaguered 
kinfolk return to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters draped themselves in the red and black flag of  
Albania and shouted anti-Serbian slogans in Lafayette Park, across 
the street from the White House, and several blocks from where 
NATO's leaders were meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	They had a mixed message for NATO: gratitude for the NATO  
bombing campaign against the Serb forces of Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic and anger that no ground troops have been 
deployed nor weapons sent to the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is helping but they are falling far short of what is  
needed,'' said Avni Mustafaj, president of the National Albanian 
American Council. ``While NATO is celebrating its anniversary, it 
should be ashamed for allowing the slaughter of children in 
Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Steinbaum, legislative director for Rep. Eliot Engel,  
D-N.Y., told the crowd he saw similarities between the Yugoslav 
drive to remove ethnic Albanians from Kosovo and the banishment of 
Jews by Nazi troops in the 1930s. He called on the crowd to visit 
congressional leaders to voice their outrage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come into our offices and tell us why we need a free Kosovo,''  
Steinbaum said. ``It's in your hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A protest march organized by a Washington-area Serbian church  
against the bombing was scheduled for the same park Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mustafaj said he didn't expect his group to conduct any  
counter-demonstrations Saturday, but added: ``If members of our 
community want to come and make their voices heard, I will not stop 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday at the Washington Monument, dozens of protesters  
organized by the Fourth Freedom Forum and the Citizens' Summit to 
De-Nuke NATO demonstrated against nuclear weapons and the NATO 
airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our focus is the present nuclear dilemma facing the world,''  
said Alistair Miller, director of the Fourth Freedom Forum's 
Washington office. ``NATO's nuclear weapons were introduced decades 
ago to counter a perceived threat that no longer exists.''

<HEADLINE> Excerpts of Truman's NATO Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from a speech by President Truman at the original NATO  
signing ceremony on April 4, 1949: 

</P>
<P>
	``What we are about to do here is a neighborly act. We are like  
a group of householders, living in the same locality, who decide to 
express their community of interests by entering into a formal 
association for their mutual self-protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 

</P>
<P>
	``This treaty is a simple document ... but if it had existed in  
1914 and in 1939, supported by the nations which are represented 
here today, I believe it would have prevented the acts of 
aggression which led to two world wars.'' 

</P>
<P>
	------	 

</P>
<P>
	``The nations represented here are bound together by ties of  
long standing. We are joined by a common heritage of democracy, 
individual liberty, and the rule of law. These are the ties of a 
peaceful way of life. In this pact we merely give them formal 
recognition.'' 

</P>
<P>
	------	 

</P>
<P>
	``In this pact we hope to create a shield against aggression and  
the fear of aggression -- a bulwark which will permit us to get on 
with the real business of government and society, the business of 
achieving a fuller and happier life for our citizens.'' 

</P>
<P>
	------	 


</P>
<P>
	``For us, war is not inevitable. We do not believe that there  
are blind tides of history which sweep men one way or the other. In 
our own time we have seen brave men overcome obstacles that seemed 
insurmountable and forces that seemed overwhelming. Men with 
courage and vision can still determine their own destiny. They can 
choose slavery or freedom -- war or peace. 
</P>
<P>
	I have no doubt which they will choose. The treaty we are  
signing here today is evidence of the path they will follow. ... If 
there is anything inevitable in the future, it is the will of the 
people of the world for freedom and peace.''

<HEADLINE>  Police Obtain School Security Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Surveillance tapes from the security  
cameras at Columbine High may show whether the two gunmen who died 
in the school bloodbath had accomplices, investigators said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The center of the slaughter -- the second-story library, where  
nearly all of the dead were found -- had no cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are also interviewing surviving members of the  
Trenchcoat Mafia to learn whether others had a role in the attack, 
and are trying to trace the shotguns and semiautomatic weapons the 
two teen-agers used to kill 13 people and then themselves on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Focusing on the theory that Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold,  
17, had help in building their arsenal and bringing their bombs and 
guns to school, investigators will be reviewing tapes from the 
security cameras mounted around the school, said sheriff's Lt. John 
Kiekbusch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ideally they would show the movement and also the actual  
placement perhaps of some of the explosive devices, prior to the 
incident,'' Kiekbusch said. ``If that's the case, we have got just 
very important evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They are time-lapse cameras, meaning they periodically take  
pictures instead of running continuously. Each tape goes back about 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said the tapes have not yet been  
viewed. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have also interviewed at least 500 people,  
including friends, students and teachers. They are especially 
interested in members of Trenchcoat Mafia, a group of outcasts who 
wore black. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we know someone who either professes to be a part of that  
group or someone else who can tell us they are a part of that 
group, you bet we'd like to talk to them, probably more than 
anyone,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County Sheriff's Lt. Dave Taylor said investigators  
have not identified a specific third suspect. ``We are doing an 
ongoing investigation. There are a lot of names coming up,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another key area is tracing the guns: two sawed-off shotguns, a  
9 mm carbine rifle and a TEC DC-9 semiautomatic pistol, a modified 
version of the now-banned TEC-9 assault weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Bettendorf, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol,  
Tobacco and Firearms, said it will be difficult to trace the 
weapons. ``These weapons were originally purchased in the late 
1960s or early 1970s, and there is no indication they belong to the 
parents,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettendorf said investigators are still trying to figure out how  
a large propane tank bomb was placed in the school's kitchen. 
Authorities found it Thursday as they swept the school. ``That's 
the question everybody is asking,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys also packed the big pockets in their utility pants with  
ammunition and used pipe bombs stuffed with nails and BBs as 
shrapnel. District Attorney Dave Thomas said most of the explosive 
devices found in the school were made from readily available 
household items. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, more than 900 mourners gathered at Foothills Bible  
Church for the first of many memorial services expected through the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The service was held for 16-year-old John Tomlin, who worked  
after school in a gardening store, belonged to a church youth group 
and went on a missionary trip to Mexico. He will be buried in 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Schools are disintegrating, partly because prayer has been  
removed from them,'' said the boy's mother, Doreen Tomlin. Asked 
whether the school system had failed, the boy's father, John, said: 
``The only system that has failed is that God is left out of 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two fellow members of the Trenchcoat Mafia apologized to  
families and friends of the victims on Wednesday. ``There was no 
sign they would do this,'' sobbed Nicole Makham. ``We would just 
like to say that we're sorry for what they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A makeshift memorial to the victims near Columbine has continued  
to grow steadily, with hundreds of flower bouquets, stuffed 
animals, signs and cards. One sign contained images of children's 
hands in fingerpaint with children's names on them. Another said: 
``Silence contributes to moral decay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine students will return to classrooms, though not their  
own, next Thursday. Columbine students, staff and faculty will 
share nearby Chatfield High School, with Columbine classes taking 
place in an afternoon split session.

<HEADLINE> Most Jamaican Riot Deaths by Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- Foreign embassies lifted travel  
warnings today for Jamaica, and police raised the death toll from 
this week's rioting to nine, admitting that seven people were 
killed by officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The riots began April 16, sparked by a 30 percent hike in  
gasoline prices and plans to introduce new taxes. They subsided 
Thursday as the government indicated it was reconsidering the tax 
hikes. 
</P>
<P>
	As work crews cleared roads and swept up glass from broken  
windows on Friday, the United States, Canada, Britain and Germany -- 
Jamaica's largest sources of tourists -- withdrew official travel 
warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials tried to salvage the spring tourism season  
after days of canceled flights and cruises. The Jamaica Tourist 
Board offered free trips to travel agents and travel writers and 
boosted overseas advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday night, officers killed two men during a shootout in  
Spanish Town, just west of Kingston, after allegedly discovering 
them breaking into a building. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers fatally shot another man Tuesday in Kingston after  
looters at a supermarket attacked a police patrol. Another man and 
a woman were killed the same day during a police shootout with 
protesters in Spanish Town. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, police killed a man at a roadblock, alleging he  
and other protesters fired on officers and attacked them with 
gasoline bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	An off-duty army corporal was shot by police Tuesday in the  
Seaview Gardens area of Kingston. Police said they were fired at, 
but the army corporal's wife claimed he was playing cricket with 
neighborhood children. 
</P>
<P>
	Police shootings in Jamaica have drawn criticism by  
international human rights groups. Last year, police killed 145 
people in a country of 2.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the police-related killings, one alleged looter  
was shot by a business owner Monday in Kingston, and private guards 
killed a pregnant woman during a shootout with looters the same 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Business and labor leaders reviewed the tax increase proposal  
Friday and tried to come up with alternate ways to raise revenue. 
They were planning to deliver recommendations to the Cabinet by 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jamaica Confederation of Trade Unions, the country's largest  
trade group, declined to participate and dismissed the committee as 
``placative.''

<HEADLINE> Banned Gun Used in School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- One of the guns used in the Columbine High School  
rampage was a semi-automatic pistol favored by drug dealers and 
mass murderers. Federal law now bans their manufacture. 
</P>
<P>
	At 12.5 inches, the TEC DC-9 is short enough to hide under a  
trench coat. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro- and anti-gun forces Friday seized on news of the weapons  
used by the two students in Littleton as evidence that gun control 
laws have failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Although dozens of guns have been banned under federal law,  
those already on the market can still be sold. The DC-9 is one of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gun was made so that you can spray fire from the hip,''  
said Kristen Rand of the Washington-based Violence Policy Center, 
which supports gun control. ``These are far more deadly than mere 
handguns. Their features surely increased the carnage in this 
tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The arsenal Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold took to school  
included an assortment of homemade bombs, the DC-9, two illegal 
sawed-off shotguns and a short-muzzle carbine military-style rifle 
-- a type of gun used by two Jonesboro, Ark., students in another 
schoolyard massacre last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities are using the serial numbers to try to track  
how the boys got the guns but say that will be difficult because 
the shotguns were originally bought in the late 1960s or early 
'70s. The carbine and the DC-9 have been tracked to separate 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no indication they belong to the parents,'' said  
Lawrence Bettendorf, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the DC-9 that drew the ire of gun control advocates.  
</P>
<P>
	After some states banned Intratec Inc.'s TEC-9 in 1990, the  
Miami company changed the barrel so that a silencer could no longer 
be attached and renamed it the TEC DC-9. After the 1994 federal ban 
on the manufacture of certain assault weapons included both the 
TEC-9 and the TEC DC-9, the company changed the sling on the gun 
and renamed it the AB-10. Critics say the letters stand for ``after 
ban.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intratec officials didn't return calls seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``Its a major loophole in the laws,'' said Nancy Hwa of Handgun  
Control Inc., a Washington group. 
</P>
<P>
	Even gun aficionados agree that the changes made to the renamed  
weapon were slight. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you had happen was (the government) would ban a specific  
weapon and the manufacturer would say, `OK, and give the weapon a 
different name,''' said Bob Glass, publisher of The Partisan 
magazine, a libertarian publication that opposes the assault 
weapons ban. ``The only change was that the original TEC-9 had 
threading on the end of the barrel which would facilitate a barrel 
extension, or a silencer. That's sort of the game that has been 
played between manufacturers and the government for the last 10 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he draws a different conclusion from gun critics. The  
Littleton slayings simply show that weapons bans don't work and 
should be abandoned, Glass said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These kids made pipe bombs,'' he said. ``Are you going to ban  
pipes? Are you going to ban trench coats?'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Intratec advertisement said its slick pistol grip resisted  
fingerprints and called it ``as tough as your toughest customer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guns can also carry clips of up to 32 bullets. The federal  
Brady Law forbids the manufacture of clips holding more than 10 
bullets, but allows the sale of those made before the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The TEC-9 and its variations have long been associated with  
crime. The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence is suing Intratec on 
behalf of the relatives of several victims killed in a San 
Francisco office building by Gian Luigi Ferri in 1993. Ferri used a 
DC-9. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hi-Point 9 mm carbine rifle the gunmen used was made during  
the 1990s. The manufacturer's ads call it ``the hottest gun since 
the SKS,'' an inexpensive military-style weapon imported from 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Columbine High students had stuff the baggy pockets of  
their cargo pants with spare magazines. They carried pipe bombs 
packed with nails and BBs to maximize the amount of shrapnel.

<HEADLINE> Mobil's Earnings Fall 34 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- Mobil Corp. reported its first-quarter  
earnings fell 34 percent, the result of depressed crude prices that 
have eroded profits for most oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's second-largest oil company, which plans to merge  
with Exxon Corp., said it earned $464 million, or 58 cents per 
share, down from $705 million, or 86 cents per share, in the first 
quarter of 1998.

<P>
	Mobil beat the expectations of Wall Street analysts who  
predicted it would earn 54 cents per share, according to First Call 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter revenues fell to $12.18 billion from $13.63  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	During the quarter, the price of crude oil dropped $2.70 per  
barrel, Mobil said. Demand for oil and refined products has fallen 
because of weak economic conditions in Asia, Latin America, Russia 
and other parts of the world, forcing oil companies to lower the 
prices they charge customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure on profits has prompted oil companies including  
Mobil to seek merger partners to cut operating costs. Exxon 
announced last year that it plans to acquire Mobil for about $73.7 
billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would be the largest merger ever and create the world's  
biggest company. The deal is expected to lead to the loss of about 
9,000 jobs, or 7 percent of the companies' worldwide work force. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobil's first-quarter net income included a $7 million charge  
for merger-related costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's exploration and producing division had $231  
million in 1999 first-quarter earnings compared with a $390 million 
a year earlier. Its marketing and refining division earnings fell 
to $291 million from $325 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobil also saw sharply lower profit in its chemical division,  
where earnings fell to $6 million from $67 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil prices have risen in recent weeks, offering oil companies  
the prospect of a better second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Rugby Team Strips, No Full Monty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDELLIN, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia's national underwater rugby  
team performed a striptease to raise money for a trip to the world 
championships, but the mayor barred The Full Monty. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve of the 25 team members gyrated before 1,500 gleeful  
female fans-- many hanging from the rafters -- at a disco Thursday 
night in Medellin, Colombia's second-largest city. They raised 
about a third of the $32,000 the team needs to travel to Germany 
for the championships in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments before going on stage, the first-time strippers received  
a note from the mayor's office ordering them to refrain from their 
promise of total nudity. 
</P>
<P>
	So the men stripped down to their swimming caps, goggles and  
white bikini briefs -- but not a stitch more. 
</P>
<P>
	``We we're willing to do it, but unfortunately they didn't allow  
us,'' griped Adrian Schmid, 33, one of the dancers who went out 
dressed as construction workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The strippers were worried they'd have a revolt on their hands,  
but the crowd didn't seem overly disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody said anything. The women behaved very well,'' Schmid  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In advertising the fund-raiser, the team promised ``The Full  
Monty''-- a reference to the 1997 British movie by the same name, in 
which oddball male strippers take off all of their clothes in a 
performance in unemployment-stricken Sheffield, England. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have the best bodies. But we're prepared to take it  
all off for just one night,'' said a poster featuring five naked 
players shown from neck to knee -- one of them covering his groin 
with a water rugby ball. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's show, the Colombian players performed to two of  
the stripping songs in the movie: Tom Jones' ``You Can Leave Your 
Hat On,'' and Donna Summer's ``Hot Stuff.'' The players trained for 
two months with a ballet teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	In underwater rugby, a game popular in Germany and Scandinavia,  
teams of six players try to score by stuffing a weighted rubber 
ball into baskets at the bottom of both ends of a pool. 
</P>
<P>
	The players wear fins, snorkels and masks. Light contact is  
permitted, but it is forbidden to hold, kick, punch or pull an 
opponent's swimming trunks.

<HEADLINE>  Arkansas Regains Relay Race Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- This time, Seneca Lassiter was no flop.  
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter, the most valuable male track athlete in the 1997 Penn  
Relays but a failure last year because of illness and allergies, 
made amends by anchoring Arkansas to victory in the distance medley 
relay Friday in rain-soaked and lightning-plagued Franklin Field 
before a crowd of 31,904. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the meet was delayed 20 minutes by lightning. The  
meer resume again but 30 minutes later was delayed again, this time 
for 1:20. 
</P>
<P>
	Restarted again, the meet with another 1:15. The remainder of  
the program, including the men's and women's sprint medley relay 
finals, was postponed until Saturday. Before the second restart, 
however, several teams left the stadium, thinking the meet would 
not resume, and missed their events. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter, one of the nation's premier middle-distance runners,  
made it dramatic. After inheriting a 15-meter lead and retaining it 
through two laps, Lassiter ambled around the third lap, and John 
Jordan of Georgetown caught him with 250 meters remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter, who had been conserving his energy for two more relays  
Saturday, then made a burst and won by 20 meters over SMU's Clyde 
Colenso, as the Razorbacks finished in 9 minutes, 32.81 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter wasn't worried about Jordan.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think anything about him,'' he said. ``I knew I had  
all the energy in the world. I was just jogging the third lap. I 
was just chilling it. I wanted to save myself for tomorrow. I 
finished strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas coach John McDonnell wasn't concerned, either.  
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't worry me. ... He ran easy on the third lap,''  
McDonnell said. ``It would be easier to run it smoother. ... But 
Seneca has the intention of going out and winning any way he 
wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was Arkansas' seventh in the distance medley relay  
during the 1990s and its 13th in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Lassiter had a 10-meter lead starting the final 1,600  
meters, but was beaten by 25 meters by Michigan's Kevin Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a different guy now,'' McDonnell said, referring to  
Lassiter's health. 
</P>
<P>
	SMU was runner-up at 9:35.05 and Georgetown finished third at  
9:36.31. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew he was relaxing and going at his own pace and would  
take off,'' Jordan said of Lassiter. ``When I got up on him, he 
went. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough when you're trailing a great runner like Lassiter  
by 10 or 15 meters and have to make up that much ground. I knew 
with 200 to go he had opened a big gap and I wasn't going to close 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas ended LSU's four-year winning streak in the women's 400  
relay and won the event for the first time since 1989 at 43.33, 
setting Penn Relays and Franklin Field records. The previous record 
for both was 43.42 by LSU last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Longhorns' foursome of Kim McGruder, Nanceen Perry, LaKiesha  
White and LaKeisha Backus reduced LSU to a distant runner-up, 
nearly a second back at 44.27. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody ran consistently well,'' Texas coach Bev Kearney  
said. ``Today, you had to worry about the cool weather, the rain, 
the baton slipping ... and LSU. That added intrigue to an already 
intriguing race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was shocked we ran so well under that pressure, especially  
with a freshman (White). The freshman took over Angie Vaughn's 
relay leg and people thought we were in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin, led by Janet Westphal, repeated as women's  
6,000-meter relay champion at 17:37.15, beating BYU by 15 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Westphal, running the third leg, got the baton 2 meters behind  
Wake Forest's Kelly Brady. By the time she finished, she was 15 
meters ahead, allowing Janelle Deathrage to run in command on the 
final 1,500-meter leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee, the winningest team in the history of the men's 440  
shuttle hurdles relay, won its 11th title at 56.35, while LSU's 
women won their third 400 shuttle hurdles relay championship, the 
first since 1992, at 54.91. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson men had the fastest qualifying times in both the men's  
400 (39.88) and 800 (1:22.66) relays, and Auburn led the qualifiers 
in the men's 1,600 relay at 3:06.11. The finals are Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn sprint sensation Coby Miller had the fastest qualifying  
time for Saturday's men's 100 final, clocking 10.33. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh's Trecia Smith repeated her long jump-triple jump  
double of 1997, winning the triple jump Friday at 43 feet, 6 
inches. She took the long jump Thurday.

<HEADLINE> Avs Head to San Jose for Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Their concentration wavering, their energy  
lacking, the Colorado Avalanche tried gamely to get back into a 
hockey mindset. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's practice, the Avs' first full workout since a  
shooting rampage at a suburban Denver high school left 15 dead and 
23 wounded on Tuesday, started sloppily. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a tough start, and that's very understandable,''  
Avalanche coach Bob Hartley said. ``I can tell you that I wouldn't 
have accepted that kind of start if we hadn't known the kind of 
tragedy that happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``But our concentration got better as the practice went on.  
Getting on the ice for us is a distraction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartley had no doubt his team would be ready for the opening  
game of their first-round NHL playoff series with the San Jose 
Sharks on Saturday. The series was supposed to open in Denver, with 
games on Wednesday and Thursday. But because of the tragedy, those 
two games were postponed and the series will open in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is very sad,'' he said. ``It's tough to explain how  
we feel as a team. But we just have to focus on Game 1, and I trust 
my players will be ready for that game. Getting away from Denver, I 
think, is going to be good for our focus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was worried about playing the first two games on the  
road instead of at home, Hartley said, ``Looking at what this 
community has had to go through for the last two days, I think 
worrying about home ice would be very selfish. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made the decision to reschedule for the community. Now we  
have to find a way to support our community by winning hockey 
games. We're going to San Jose on a mission. That mission is that 
we want to dedicate our games to Columbine High School.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartley admitted that he, too, was deeply affected by the  
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the last 24 hours or so, it's been pretty tough to focus  
on hockey,'' he said. ``There are many dads on this team. I'm a 
dad. When I go home, I look at my two kids. It makes you wonder as 
a parent: Where are we going? Since this tragedy, I'm having a hard 
time being a hockey coach. Hockey is far away right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``But on the other hand, we're professionals and when the pucks  
drops on Saturday, we have to focus on our jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if, as a Canadian, he viewed the United States as a  
violent society, Hartley said, ``I don't think we can look at this 
as Canadian or American. I think we have to look at this as people 
in a society. We are the examples. We are the adults, and we have 
to lead these kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could happen anywhere. You're talking about two kids  
(suspects) with problems. There are kids with problems in Canada, 
there are some in the States, there are some all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always think you're safe from those incidents. You think  
it might happen far, far away from you. But when it's 10 or 15 
minutes from your house, it makes you really believe there are a 
lot of people out there who need our help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although no members of the Avalanche organization were believed  
directly affected by the shootings, all were touched emotionally. 
General manager Pierre Lacroix regularly takes walks with his wife 
in a park adjacent to the school. Lacroix and Charlie Lyons, CEO of 
the company that owns the Avalanche, live within a mile or two of 
the school. A number of players live nearby, and forward Claude 
Lemieux's babysitter attends that school. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the last few days, it's been very difficult to think about  
what we had to do,'' Lemieux said. ``The decision to postpone those 
games was best for everybody. I feel there will be enough time for 
us to be ready and have our minds on the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avalanche forward Peter Forsberg agreed with his coach that ``it  
might be good for us to start on the road because of what happened 
here.''

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted in `Thrill Killings' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWTON, N.J. (AP) -- A 20-year-old man was convicted of murder  
today in the ``thrill killings'' of two pizza deliverymen who were 
lured to an abandoned cabin and shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Koskovich could get the death penalty for the 1997  
slayings of delivery man Jeremy Giordano and pizza shop owner 
Giorgio Gallara. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury, which took eight hours to reach a verdict, will begin  
considering the penalty Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Koskovich and his friend Jayson Vreeland just  
wanted to see what it felt like to kill. 
</P>
<P>
	Vreeland, 19, is awaiting trial. He does not face the death  
penalty because he was a juvenile at the time of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the two men called a half-dozen pizza parlors  
before finding one that would deliver to the cabin in rural 
northwestern New Jersey. The county has the state's lowest crime 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense argued that Koskovich was too drugged on  
prescription painkillers to know what he was doing and that he 
plotted only to rob the two pizza men. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors said Koskovich carefully planned the shootings,  
taking target practice and trying to recruit friends.

<HEADLINE>  Morris Returns To LPGA Tour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKBRIDGE, Ga. (AP) -- When unsure of which club to pluck from  
her bag, Marianne Morris felt her brother's presence. When hovering 
nervously over a long putt, she remembered his philosophy on life. 
</P>
<P>
	Go for it. Enjoy yourself.  
</P>
<P>
	Playing for the first time since her brother was gunned down in  
a robbery, Morris shot a 5-under-par 67 Friday and was just two 
shots behind leader Maria Hjorth after the first round of LPGA's 
Chick-fil-A Charity Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie Spalding and Kelly Robbins were tied at 66. But the most  
remarkable performance of the day belonged to Morris, clearly 
inspired by the memory of her brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Morris, his sister's mentor, business partner and best  
friend, was shot to death Feb. 21 in an apparent robbery at their 
suburban Atlanta golf shop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I feel like I'm playing for both of us,'' said Marianne  
Morris, one of four players two shots off the lead. ``Maybe I'll be 
more like him: play aggressive and enjoy being out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, 34, considered quitting the tour after her brother's  
death, unsure if the game still had meaning. But two weeks ago, she 
picked up a sand wedge and started chipping. 
</P>
<P>
	She decided to resume her career at Eagles Landing Country Club  
south of Atlanta, where her brother took time away from their 
business a year ago to serve as her caddy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't even think I'd break 80,'' said Morris, a native of  
Middletown, Ohio. ``I haven't touched a club in so long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her round was highlighted by a couple of 25-foot birdie putts  
and another from 20 feet on greens quickened by unseasonably warm, 
dry weather. Each time, she wondered if her brother was guiding the 
ball into the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not known for draining a lot of long putts,'' Morris said.  
``I honestly think there was something going on. Every day that 
goes by now, he'll be watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hjorth bogeyed her final hole, missing a 3-foot putt. That was  
the only slip for the 25-year-old Swede, who had the best round of 
her two-year career and finds herself leading an LPGA tournament 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will go out tomorrow and try to forget today,'' she said.  
``I'll be focused and not look too far into the future. That's been 
a problem for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spalding, who missed the cut four times in her first nine  
tournaments and hasn't finished higher than 31st this year, also 
put together a career-low round despite a triple-bogey at No. 9. 
She compensated with 10 birdies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love fast greens,'' Spalding said. ``All you have to do is  
pick your line and hit it there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris' brother, five years her senior, encouraged her to play  
more aggressively. Last Christmas, he sent his sister a card that 
said, ``1999 is going to be your year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friday was certainly her day. Despite going through the most  
traumatic experience of her life, Morris felt a sense of calm each 
time she stood over a difficult putt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I was going to make them,'' Morris said. ``I felt  
as good on the golf course as I ever have. I don't think I'll be as 
hard as myself as I used to. I'm fortunate to play golf for a 
living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Crafter, who was part of the group at 67 that also included  
Rachel Hetherington and Lorie Kane, said Morris' game will benefit 
from a new perspective on life. 
</P>
<P>
	``The grieving process takes time, but it makes coming back and  
playing so much easier,'' said Crafter, recalling the deaths of her 
parents. ``You can take the pressure of a 3-foot putt. It doesn't 
matter if you miss it. There are more important things in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone seemed to be cheering for Morris -- even those who are  
trying to beat her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a good player,'' Hetherington said, ``and she deserves  
to play well with what she's been through.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Morris Returns To LPGA Tour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKBRIDGE, Ga. (AP) -- When unsure of which club to pluck from  
her bag, Marianne Morris felt her brother's presence. When hovering 
nervously over a long putt, she remembered his philosophy on life. 
</P>
<P>
	Go for it. Enjoy yourself.  
</P>
<P>
	Playing for the first time since her brother was gunned down in  
a robbery, Morris shot a 5-under-par 67 Friday and was just two 
shots behind leader Maria Hjorth after the first round of LPGA's 
Chick-fil-A Charity Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie Spalding and Kelly Robbins were tied at 66. But the most  
remarkable performance of the day belonged to Morris, clearly 
inspired by the memory of her brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Morris, his sister's mentor, business partner and best  
friend, was shot to death Feb. 21 in an apparent robbery at their 
suburban Atlanta golf shop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I feel like I'm playing for both of us,'' said Marianne  
Morris, one of four players two shots off the lead. ``Maybe I'll be 
more like him: play aggressive and enjoy being out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, 34, considered quitting the tour after her brother's  
death, unsure if the game still had meaning. But two weeks ago, she 
picked up a sand wedge and started chipping. 
</P>
<P>
	She decided to resume her career at Eagles Landing Country Club  
south of Atlanta, where her brother took time away from their 
business a year ago to serve as her caddy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't even think I'd break 80,'' said Morris, a native of  
Middletown, Ohio. ``I haven't touched a club in so long.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in 11-Year-Old's Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Prosecutors say they're confident that this time  
they have charged the right person with murdering an 11-year-old 
girl -- a crime initially blamed on two little boys. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd Durr, 30, already accused in three other attacks on young  
girls, was charged Thursday with first-degree murder, criminal 
sexual assault and kidnapping in the death of Ryan Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	``Floyd Durr is a sexual predator who has preyed on young  
children, and we are not going to rest until we bring him to 
justice,'' said Cook County State's Attorney Richard Devine. 
</P>
<P>
	Durr, who has served time for attempted murder and robbery, also  
was charged with raping a 14-year-old by whom police say he 
fathered twins. 
</P>
<P>
	Durr, already jailed on other charges, was ordered held without  
bond. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Geary Kull, said his client was despondent over the  
new charges, and he questioned whether Durr could get a fair trial 
in view of the heavy media attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``These charges are ugly,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The girl's body was found July 28 in a vacant lot on Chicago's  
South Side. She had been savagely beaten and sexually molested. Her 
underpants had been stuffed into her mouth, and twigs and grass had 
been packed into her nostrils. 
</P>
<P>
	Two boys, aged 7 and 8, were arrested 12 days later after six  
hours of questioning by detectives, who said that they had 
confessed. The charges created a furious protest in the community 
and were dropped Sept. 4 after lab tests found semen in the 
underwear. 
</P>
<P>
	Durr was first named a suspect in Ryan's death in October. At  
the time, prosecutors said he admitted performing a sex act over 
her body but denied killing her. 
</P>
<P>
	The long period during which Durr was not charged angered many  
Chicago residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Anger lingers as well over the treatment of the two boys. The  
family of the 8-year-old boy has sued the city for $100 million, 
charging that detectives framed the boys despite evidence an adult 
committed the crime.

<HEADLINE>  Arkansas Regains Relay Race Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- This time, Seneca Lassiter was no flop.  
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter, the most valuable male track athlete in the 1997 Penn  
Relays but a failure last year because of illness and allergies, 
made amends by anchoring Arkansas to victory in the distance medley 
relay Friday in rain-soaked and lightning-plagued Franklin Field 
before a crowd of 31,904. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the meet was delayed 20 minutes by lightning. The  
meer resume again but 30 minutes later was delayed again, this time 
for 1:20. 
</P>
<P>
	Restarted again, the meet with another 1:15. The remainder of  
the program, including the men's and women's sprint medley relay 
finals, was postponed until Saturday. Before the second restart, 
however, several teams left the stadium, thinking the meet would 
not resume, and missed their events. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter, one of the nation's premier middle-distance runners,  
made it dramatic. After inheriting a 15-meter lead and retaining it 
through two laps, Lassiter ambled around the third lap, and John 
Jordan of Georgetown caught him with 250 meters remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter, who had been conserving his energy for two more relays  
Saturday, then made a burst and won by 20 meters over SMU's Clyde 
Colenso, as the Razorbacks finished in 9 minutes, 32.81 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter wasn't worried about Jordan.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think anything about him,'' he said. ``I knew I had  
all the energy in the world. I was just jogging the third lap. I 
was just chilling it. I wanted to save myself for tomorrow. I 
finished strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas coach John McDonnell wasn't concerned, either.  
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't worry me. ... He ran easy on the third lap,''  
McDonnell said. ``It would be easier to run it smoother. ... But 
Seneca has the intention of going out and winning any way he 
wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was Arkansas' seventh in the distance medley relay  
during the 1990s and its 13th in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Lassiter had a 10-meter lead starting the final 1,600  
meters, but was beaten by 25 meters by Michigan's Kevin Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a different guy now,'' McDonnell said, referring to  
Lassiter's health. 
</P>
<P>
	SMU was runner-up at 9:35.05 and Georgetown finished third at  
9:36.31. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew he was relaxing and going at his own pace and would  
take off,'' Jordan said of Lassiter. ``When I got up on him, he 
went. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough when you're trailing a great runner like Lassiter  
by 10 or 15 meters and have to make up that much ground. I knew 
with 200 to go he had opened a big gap and I wasn't going to close 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas ended LSU's four-year winning streak in the women's 400  
relay and won the event for the first time since 1989 at 43.33, 
setting Penn Relays and Franklin Field records. The previous record 
for both was 43.42 by LSU last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Longhorns' foursome of Kim McGruder, Nanceen Perry, LaKiesha  
White and LaKeisha Backus reduced LSU to a distant runner-up, 
nearly a second back at 44.27. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody ran consistently well,'' Texas coach Bev Kearney  
said. ``Today, you had to worry about the cool weather, the rain, 
the baton slipping ... and LSU. That added intrigue to an already 
intriguing race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was shocked we ran so well under that pressure, especially  
with a freshman (White). The freshman took over Angie Vaughn's 
relay leg and people thought we were in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin, led by Janet Westphal, repeated as women's  
6,000-meter relay champion at 17:37.15, beating BYU by 15 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Westphal, running the third leg, got the baton 2 meters behind  
Wake Forest's Kelly Brady. By the time she finished, she was 15 
meters ahead, allowing Janelle Deathrage to run in command on the 
final 1,500-meter leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee, the winningest team in the history of the men's 440  
shuttle hurdles relay, won its 11th title at 56.35, while LSU's 
women won their third 400 shuttle hurdles relay championship, the 
first since 1992, at 54.91. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson men had the fastest qualifying times in both the men's  
400 (39.88) and 800 (1:22.66) relays, and Auburn led the qualifiers 
in the men's 1,600 relay at 3:06.11. The finals are Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn sprint sensation Coby Miller had the fastest qualifying  
time for Saturday's men's 100 final, clocking 10.33. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh's Trecia Smith repeated her long jump-triple jump  
double of 1997, winning the triple jump Friday at 43 feet, 6 
inches. She took the long jump Thurday.

<HEADLINE> NATO's 17-Point Statement on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The 17-point statement on Kosovo, issued Friday by the heads of  
state and government attending the 50th anniversary NATO summit: 
</P>
<P>
	1. The crisis in Kosovo represents a fundamental challenge to  
the values for which NATO has stood since its foundation: 
democracy, human rights and the rule of law. It is the culmination 
of a deliberate policy of oppression, ethnic cleansing and violence 
pursued by the Belgrade regime under the direction of President 
Milosevic. We will not allow this campaign of terror to succeed. 
NATO is determine to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	2. NATO's military action against the Federal Republic of  
Yugoslavia (FRY) supports the political aims of the international 
community, which were reaffirmed in recent statements by the U.N. 
secretary-general and the European Union: a peaceful, multiethnic 
and democratic Kosovo where all its people can live in security and 
enjoy universal human rights and freedoms on an equal basis. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Our military actions are directed not at the Serb people but  
at the policies of the regime in Belgrade, which has repeatedly 
rejected all efforts to solve the crisis peacefully. President 
Milosevic must: 
</P>
<P>
	-Ensure a verifiable stop to all military action and the  
immediate ending of violence and repression in Kosovo; 
</P>
<P>
	-Withdraw from Kosovo his military, police and paramilitary  
forces; 
</P>
<P>
	-Agree to the stationing in Kosovo of an international military  
presence; 
</P>
<P>
	-Agree to the unconditional and safe return of all refugees and  
displaced persons, and unhindered access to them by humanitarian 
air organizations; and 
</P>
<P>
	-Provide credible assurance of his willingness to work for the  
establishment of a political framework agreement based on the 
Rambouillet accords. 
</P>
<P>
	4. There can be no compromise on these conditions. As long as  
Belgrade fails to meet the legitimate demands of the international 
community and continues to inflict immense human suffering, 
Alliance air operations against the Yugoslav war machine will 
continue. We hold President Milosevic and the Belgrade leadership 
responsible for the safety of all Kosovar citizens. We will fulfill 
our promise to the Kosovar people that they can return to their 
homes and live in peace and security. 
</P>
<P>
	5. We are intensifying NATO's military actions to increase the  
pressure on Belgrade. Allied governments are putting in place 
additional measures to tighten the constraints on the Belgrade 
regime. These include intensified implementation of economic 
sanctions and an embargo on petroleum products on which we welcome 
the EU lead. We have directed our defense ministers to determine 
ways that NATO can contribute to halting the delivery of war 
material including by launching maritime operations, taking into 
account the possible consequences on Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	6. NATO is prepared to suspend its airstrikes once Belgrade has  
unequivocally accepted the above mentioned conditions and 
demonstrably begun to withdraw its forces from Kosovo according to 
a precise and rapid timetable. This could follow the passage of a 
United Nations Security Council resolution, which we will seek, 
requiring the withdrawal of Serb forces and the demilitarization of 
Kosovo and encompassing the deployment of an international military 
force to safeguard the swift return of all refugees and displaced 
persons as well as the establishment of an international 
provisional administration of Kosovo under which its people can 
enjoy substantial autonomy within the FRY. NATO remains ready to 
form the core of such an international military force. It would be 
multinational in character with contributions from non-NATO 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	7. Russia has a particular responsibility in the United Nations  
and an important role to play in the search for a solution to the 
conflict in Kosovo. Such a solution must be based on the conditions 
of the international community as laid out above. President 
Milosevic's offers to date do not meet this test. We want to work 
constructively with Russia, in the spirit of the founding act. 
</P>
<P>
	8. The long-planned, unrestrained and continuing assault by  
Yugoslav military, police and paramilitary forces on Kosovars and 
the repression directed against other minorities of the FRY are 
aggravating the already massive humanitarian catastrophe. This 
threatens to destabilize the surrounding region. 
</P>
<P>
	9. NATO, its members and its partners have responded to the  
humanitarian emergency and are intensifying their refugee and 
humanitarian relief operations in close cooperation with the UNHCR, 
the lead agency in this field, and with other relevant 
organizations. We will continue our assistance as long as 
necessary. NATO forces are making a major contribution to this 
task. 
</P>
<P>
	10. We pay tribute to the servicemen and women of NATO whose  
courage and dedication are ensuring the success of our military and 
humanitarian operations. 
</P>
<P>
	11. Atrocities against the people of Kosovo by FRY military,  
police and paramilitary forces represent a flagrant violation of 
international law. Our governments will cooperate with the 
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) to 
support investigation of all those, including at the highest 
levels, responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity. 
NATO will support the ICTY in its efforts to secure relevant 
information. There can be no lasting peace without justice. 
</P>
<P>
	12. We acknowledge and welcome the courageous support that  
states in the region are providing to our efforts in Kosovo. The 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Turkey recognizes the 
Republic of Macedonia with its constitutional name) and Albania 
have played a particularly important role, not least in accepting 
hundreds of thousands of refugees from Kosovo. The states in the 
region are bearing substantial economic and social burdens stemming 
from the current conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	13. We will not tolerate threats by the Belgrade regime to the  
security of its neighbors. We will respond to such challenges by 
Belgrade to its neighbors resulting from the presence of NATO 
forces or their activities on their territory during this crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	14. We reaffirm our support for the territorial integrity and  
sovereignty of all countries in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	15. We reaffirm our strong support for the democratically  
elected government of Montenegro. Any move by Belgrade to undermine 
the government of President Djukanovic will have grave 
consequences. FRY forces should leave the demilitarized zone of 
Prevlaka immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	16. The objectives of a free, prosperous, open and economically  
integrated Southeast Europe cannot be fully assured until the FRY 
embarks upon a transition to democracy. Accordingly, we express our 
support for the objective of a democratic FRY which protests the 
rights of all minorities, including those in Vojvodina and Sandjak, 
and promise to work for such change through and beyond the current 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	17. It is our aim to make stability in Southeast Europe a  
priority of our trans-Atlantic agenda. Our governments will 
cooperate urgently through NATO as well as through OSCE, and for 
those of us which are members, the European Union, to support the 
nations of Southeast Europe in forging a better future for the 
region -- one based upon democracy, justice, economic integration 
and security cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Human Ancestor Possibly Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The long list of human ancestors has a new  
member, the earliest known tool user who was carving meat with 
sharp stones 2.5 million years ago in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	So unexpected was the discovery of a skull and bones that  
researchers have named the ancestor ``garhi,'' meaning ``surprise'' 
in the local language of Ethiopia's Afar desert. 
</P>
<P>
	A descendent of the species that produced the famous Lucy  
skeleton in east Africa, the new hominid is a candidate for 
earliest human ancestor, the researchers say in an article in 
today's issue of the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthropologist Tim White of the University of California at  
Berkeley said the new species ``could turn out to be the link'' 
between the genus Homo, which includes modern humans -- Homo sapiens 
-- and its predecessor, Australopithecus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is in the right place, at the right time, to be the  
ancestor of early (humans), however defined,'' reported the team 
led by Berhane Asfaw of Rift Valley Research Service in Addis 
Ababa, Ethiopia, and White. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so sure, however, is anthropologist Bernard Wood of George  
Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's always good news when people find more fossil  
evidence,'' he said in a telephone interview, ``but ... I don't 
think we can be sure it's an ancestor of later'' humans. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they've found is what many of us were expecting, that  
there is quite a lot of variety in early hominids ... in this 
particular period,'' Wood said. ``I think it's ironic in some ways 
that it's been called a surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new species has been tentatively named Australopithecus  
garhi. It has large teeth and a projecting face, somewhat similar 
to the well-known fossil Lucy, who lived 3.2 million years ago and 
was of the Australopithecus afarensis species, with apelike upper 
arms that were long relative to her legs. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the more human-like Homo erectus developed, about  
1.7 million years ago, legs were longer and more human, and 
forearms had shortened. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the relationship between arm and leg bones from a  
second individual found near the new skull, garhi was between the 
two, with long, human-like legs but not yet having shortened 
forearms. 
</P>
<P>
	The skull was from a male, with a small brain case and a  
protruding jaw. The individual whose arm and leg bones were found 
would have been about 4-feet-10, White said. 
</P>
<P>
	An antelope jaw and other animal bones found near the garhi  
skeleton show cut marks from tools, perhaps the earliest evidence 
of human tool use in butchering animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden this is a bipedal primate with a difference,''  
White said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have the clearest evidence these very early hominids  
were butchering mammals and were knowledgeable about the ... 
(marrow) within the bones, a highly valuable food resource,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	The presence of the tools and the bones together ``doesn't prove  
that the individual was the one who held the stone tool, but it's 
pretty strong evidence,'' he went on. 
</P>
<P>
	The marks show the flesh was cut from the bones and the bones  
were broken at both ends, indicating an effort to extract the 
marrow, an important new food for hominids, according to a second 
paper by a team led by White, the late Jean de Heinzelin of the 
Royal Belgian Institute of Science and J. Desmond Clark, also at 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently a desert, 2.5 million years ago the region where the  
bones were found was a broad, shallow lake surrounded by grassland, 
the scientists reported. It was not clear, however, whether garhi 
hunted the animals that came to the lake or merely took advantage 
of dead animals found there.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Wellstone Endorses Bradley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrat Bill Bradley picked up the first  
congressional endorsement Friday of his presidential candidacy, 
liberal Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone, who briefly considered running himself for the  
Democratic nomination in 2000, has close ties to labor and farm 
activists who could help Bradley in Iowa, where the first caucuses 
will be held. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone said he believes Bradley, a former New Jersey senator,  
can defeat Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination 
despite Gore's support among party leaders and polls that show 
Bradley trailing badly. Both Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle and 
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt back Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone has been one of the harshest critics of the Clinton  
administration among congressional Democrats. He said he likes 
Bradley's liberal stands on race and poverty and his support for 
national health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the right time to be very clear about my support for  
him,'' said Wellstone. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone plans to endorse Bradley formally at a joint  
appearance Saturday before the Minnesota Democratic Farmer Labor 
Party's central committee. They plan to campaign together Sunday in 
Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very happy to have the support of Senator Wellstone,''  
said Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser. ``Bradley has admired his work 
for a long time and is looking forward to working with him on the 
campaign.''

<HEADLINE> FTC Accuses Info Brokerage of Lying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission has accused an  
information broker of illegally obtaining private information about 
consumers' financial affairs and selling it to anyone willing to 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
	A complaint filed in federal court in Colorado accuses Touch  
Tone Information Inc. of ``pretexting,'' or calling banks, 
brokerages and other financial institutions and lying to get the 
information. This is the first time the government has gone after 
an information brokerage agency engaging in such practices, Joan 
Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection told 
a House subcommittee today. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein said such information can be used to open fraudulent  
credit card accounts in other names and run up delinquent debts, 
leaving innocent consumers with the bills and destroying their 
credit ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case should send a strong message to information brokers  
that the FTC will pursue firms that use false pretenses to profit 
at the expense of consumers' privacy and also create opportunities 
for economic injury to consumers by, for example, making more 
consumers vulnerable to identity theft,'' FTC Chairman Robert 
Pitofsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the commission, Touch Tone workers called banks and  
impersonated account holders by providing a consumer's name, 
address, date of birth and Social Security number. To get 
additional information, the worker then lied about the 
circumstances of the call by saying, for example, they had 
forgotten his or her checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
	``Information brokers often market pretexting services via the  
Internet to anyone willing to pay,'' the FTC said in a written 
statement. ``According to the complaint, the private financial 
information that Touch Tone obtains and sells is confidential, and 
account holders reasonably expect that such information will not be 
disclosed without their consent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed against James J. Rapp and Regana L. Rapp,  
Colorado residents who have been doing business under the name 
Touch Tone Information Inc. in Denver since January 1997, the FTC 
said.

<HEADLINE> Report on Blocked Phones Checked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- School officials are checking reports  
that Columbine High School had blocked 911 calls from school phones 
because of previous pranks. 
</P>
<P>
	A Denver police officer said he took a call from a Columbine  
student during Tuesday's shooting rampage because the boy couldn't 
get through to authorities in Jefferson County, where the school is 
located in suburban Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy told him the phone was blocked for emergency calls.  
</P>
<P>
	``They'll do that in schools, make (dozens of) 911 hangup  
calls,'' said Denver officer John Lietz. 
</P>
<P>
	Kay Pride, spokeswoman for Jefferson County schools, said they  
had heard reports that some students had trouble getting through to 
authorities. She said pay phones had been checked but no tests have 
been run yet on the school's internal system. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a question that hasn't been answered yet,'' Pride said.  
</P>
<P>
	Some students used their own cellular phones to call 911; others  
unable to get emergency calls through called family members, who 
then dialed for help. Authorities Friday released tapes of two 911 
calls made from the school; it wasn't known what type of phones 
were used for those calls. A police officer at the school also 
alerted dispatchers after hearing the first shots. 
</P>
<P>
	David Biegie, spokesman for the phone company U S West, said the  
school's internal system could be programmed by school officials to 
block any numbers they wanted, such as any long distance calls. He 
said it was possible the school blocked 911 calls on some phones, 
while giving access to phones in other parts of the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can program the phone to do whatever they want it to  
do,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said students also may have been trying to use internal phone  
systems that act only as intercoms, or failing to dial the correct 
number to get an outside line. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West ran extensive tests on pay telephones at the school and  
found them working. He said pay phones are required to have 911 
access by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	Lietz, whose daughter attends the school, said he spent more  
than two hours on the phone with the student, Matt Depew, son of a 
Denver police officer. He kept the younger Depew on the phone 
throughout the ordeal, telling him that his father, Wayne, was 
outside trying to help him.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Rely on Checking Vs. Leafs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers are employing an ancient  
strategy against the Toronto Maple Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
	It has worked so often in the past that Flyers coach Roger  
Neilson, searching for a winning solution with captain Eric Lindros 
lost to injury, eagerly adopted it. 
</P>
<P>
	It is quite simple: outplay the opposition defensively and  
victory is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the playoffs, you win with strong checking, and that's what  
we're trying to do,'' Neilson said before his team practiced Friday 
to prepare for Game 2 of the first-round series Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Neilson has been relentless in driving the point home to his  
players, who are constantly being told they can do a better job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Toronto has a top offensive team so it isn't easy, but we've  
got to do a better job checking,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Leafs have had trouble against such strategy all season.  
They were the highest-scoring team in the NHL, but their losing 
record against tight-checking Eastern Conference teams was a matter 
of record Neilson has not overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	John Vanbiesbrouck was on the top of his game in a 3-0 shutout  
victory in Game 1 Thursday night, but some of the credit also has 
to go to a Philadelphia defensive corps that has been chided by 
analysts as being too slow. But most times the Leafs fired the puck 
into Philadelphia's zone in Game 1, it was out in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know we don't have a slow defense,'' Flyers defenseman Chris  
Therien. ``I'm a tall guy but I don't think by any means I'm slow 
or Dan McGillis is slow. 
</P>
<P>
	``No way. We've got (Adam) Burt, (Dmitri) Tertyshny, Eric  
Desjardins and Steve Duchesne, and they're all good-skating 
defensemen. People want to say we're slow, that's fine. That's what 
they want to say, but I don't believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 396 best-of-7 series played in NHL history, the club  
winning Game 1 has gone on to win the series 70 percent of the time 
(276-120), including 13 of 15 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still the underdog in the series,'' Therien said. ``They  
do have a lot of speed but we have our style, which is a 
strong-checking defensive style that we believe is going to help us 
win hockey games in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the system Roger has installed and we believe it is the  
key to winning playoff games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Leafs insist they'll win with speed and offense. Forward  
Derek King said his team has to turn the puck over less frequently 
and pepper more shots at Vanbiesbrouck, who stopped the 25 he faced 
in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our biggest thing is we have to skate and move the puck a lot  
better than we did,'' King said. ``We have to put the same pressure 
on him and hope he buckles. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we throw some speed at them and get a win, we'll change  
this series around.''

<HEADLINE> NRA Still Plans Denver Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Rifle Association says it has an  
obligation to its members and, despite the wish of city officials, 
will hold a meeting next week in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA spokesman Bill Powers said Thursday the NRA will do only the  
essential annual business required under bylaws of the 
not-for-profit group at its May 1 session. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, in the aftermath of the Littleton, Colo., high  
school killings, the gun group trimmed its conference schedule to 
one day from the three that were planned and canceled seminars, 
luncheons, exhibits and festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an obligation to our members,'' Powers said. ``We will  
be coming to conduct that meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only sideline event that had been left on the calendar, an  
evening reception for Republican Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, also 
has been canceled, Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not say whether people in Denver have been taking Mayor  
Wellington Webb's advice and calling the NRA to tell it not to 
come. ``I don't think it's appropriate to respond to the mayor,'' 
Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb asked citizens to put pressure on the nation's largest  
lobbying group for gun owners, saying, ``Everyday people can make a 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want them here,'' said Denver City Council President  
Allegra ``Happy'' Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, used sawed-off shotguns,  
a semiautomatic rifle, a pistol and homemade bombs to kill 12 
students and one teacher at the school outside Denver on Tuesday 
before killing themselves.

<HEADLINE> Senate Gets Trucked Trash Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Worries about what New York City will do with  
13,000 daily tons of garbage after its local landfill closes 
prompted the revival of legislation Thursday by states that want to 
limit trucked-in trash. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not easy to dispose of waste and if you can dump on  
somebody else, you do,'' said Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., who is 
sponsoring the latest trash-import bill with Sen. George Voinovich, 
R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``New York is a very large state. There's a lot of open land in  
New York,'' Bayh said. ``They are physically able to take care of 
their own waste, they just choose not to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bayh and Voinovich joined the Senate this year but are veterans  
of the trash wars. The two former governors tried to get federal 
law changed ever since the Supreme Court struck down Ohio's 
surcharge on out-of-state garbage. 
</P>
<P>
	Once garbage was deemed to be interstate commerce, only Congress  
could regulate it. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeated efforts to permit states to limit trash travels have  
failed, but Voinovich said the impending closure of New York City's 
only landfill in 2001 put some urgency behind this year's version. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's an additional 4 million tons of trash on top of the  
3.77 million tons they currently export,'' said Voinovich. ``Where 
do people think that it will go?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The political climate also has changed because foes of traveling  
trash have been joined by the governor of Virginia, whose state has 
jumped to No. 2 among garbage importers. Much of Virginia's extra 
trash comes from New York, and Gov. Jim Gilmore has made 
restricting it a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
	New York is the No. 1 garbage-exporting state, followed by  
Illinois, New Jersey, Maryland and Missouri. The top destination 
for exported garbage is Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill introduced Thursday would allow states to impose extra  
fees and import limits on other states' garbage, and would let the 
biggest garbage importers lower the amount they accept.

<HEADLINE> Boston TV Sets Broadcasts Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- No live local SWAT team pictures. No live footage  
of terrified escaping victims. That is the pledge in principle of 
Boston TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact between the broadcasters and police is among the  
country's first in this age of ratings-driven television. 
</P>
<P>
	The voluntary regulations, which were developed months ago,  
before Tuesday's high school massacre in Littleton, Colo., set 
coverage guidelines during local hostage situations. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven TV stations and several local radio broadcasters agreed to  
the pact, which pertains to events in Massachusetts, does not 
prohibit live coverage and carries no penalty if broken. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor does it govern whether local stations air video feed coming  
in from outside the state, such as the Colorado shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston police are still meeting with station managers to  
finalize the details. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Littleton scene unfolded Tuesday, Boston's three major  
network affiliates -- ABC, CBS and NBC -- broke in and out of feeds 
from their parent networks and CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Berryhill, news director at the NBC affiliate, WHDH, said  
the station wasn't overly concerned about showing sensitive 
material because it wouldn't affect the crime scene thousands of 
miles away. The goal of the pact is to protect those involved in 
local hostage situations rather than to protect viewers from 
unfolding tragedies elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just about who wins the coverage. It's not about  
ratings and competition,'' Candy Altman, vice president and news 
director at Boston's WCVB-TV, an ABC affiliate, said Thursday. 
``It's about giving the public the information they really need to 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similar pacts were made last year among broadcasters in  
Portland, Ore., and Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston agreement limits stations to one pool camera on the  
ground and one helicopter pool in any hostage incident deemed 
``critical'' by Boston, Brookline or Massachusetts State Police. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for the pledge, police will give Boston stations  
better locations to set up pool cameras and more frequent updates. 
But sensitive footage cannot be shown until the situation has been 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Harper, a journalism professor at Ithaca College in  
New York and a former ABC bureau chief, said the problem with 
voluntary guidelines is that it's only a matter of time before 
somebody breaks them. 
</P>
<P>
	Others worried that the pact with a government agency would take  
away from the media's watchdog role.

<HEADLINE> Internet Firms Urged To Follow IBM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNNYVALE, Calif. (AP) -- Commerce Secretary William Daley is so  
impressed with IBM's decision to pull its ads from Web sites that 
don't post privacy policies that he's asking the top 20 Web 
advertisers and 400 most-visited sites to follow Big Blue's lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all need to spread the word,'' said Daley, speaking to  
Silicon Valley executives Friday. ``Maybe it's like a pyramid 
scheme -- everyone converts 10 people and they convert 10 people and 
so on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, IBM began pulling its ads from Web sites that don't  
post policies explaining how they collect and use information on 
Web users' interests, finances and spending habits. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge computer company, which spends $60 million a year on  
Web advertising, found that only 30 percent of the sites it was 
using currently had such a policy. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's share is only a small fraction of the $4 billion expected  
to be spent on Internet ads this year, and Daley said he would like 
to see more companies do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said he sent letters to the top 20 Web advertisers asking  
them to only advertise on sites with privacy policies. He said he 
also sent letters to the 400 Web sites that get the most traffic 
and do not yet have privacy policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet offers unprecedented opportunity for business  
online,'' said Daley's letter. ``Consumers will shy away from this 
new market if they believe privacy is at risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daley cited recent polling data that suggests 86 percent of  
consumers who buy products online are concerned about threats to 
their privacy, and 90 percent of Internet users would like Web 
sites to post notices explaining how they will use personal 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	``If nine out of 10 Americans agree on something, this is a  
no-brainer: companies need to do it,'' said Daley.

<HEADLINE> Albania Expels Refugees From Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUKES, Albania (AP) -- Already chased from their homes in Kosovo,  
hundreds of refugees are being forcibly moved once again, this time 
by Albanian police who want to clear out their makeshift camp in a 
field near the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Franquin, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for  
Refugees, said Friday about 3,000 people were loaded onto buses by 
Kukes police and driven out of town. The refugees, ethnic Albanians 
from Kosovo, had arrived on tractors and were staying outside Kukes 
in what is known as the ``tractor camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to expel people,'' Franquin said. ``They've been  
expelled from Kosovo. Once is enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The forced removals demonstrated how tension has increased  
around Kukes a month after the first wave of refugees arrived from 
Kosovo. While thousands headed south to Tirana and other cities on 
their own and others were driven out in government-supplied buses, 
relief officials estimate at least 100,000 remain around Kukes. 
</P>
<P>
	A city of 20,000 before the crisis, Kukes has been overwhelmed.  
Many refugees have been taken in by local families or rent rooms 
from residents seeking quick cash in a deeply impoverished region 
of Europe's poorest country. The rest stay in muddy camps set up by 
relief groups and foreign troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Franquin said robberies and attacks on refugees have increased,  
and the threat of border clashes with Yugoslavia made it imperative 
for refugees to get out of the area as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	But Franquin drew a line between what he called the UNHCR's  
encouragement that people leave and the tactics of Kukes police. 
</P>
<P>
	He told journalists that police went to the tractor camp at dawn  
Thursday, before relief workers showed up, and made people board 
buses for unknown points south. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his agency, which is coordinating the international  
relief effort, was powerless to stop local officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``Albania has the sovereignty of this country,'' he said. ``We  
can advise them, we can try to influence them, we can discuss with 
them, try to find alternative solutions, but they have the right to 
act as they want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he spoke, a police van cruised a nearby square, its  
loudspeaker blaring for refugees to get out of town within a few 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have asked them please don't use violence, please leave the  
people the freedom to choose when they will have to leave,'' 
Franquin said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the tractor camp, Mylazim Spahiu, 45, said people had no  
warning before police showed up Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been here three weeks, and all of a sudden police came  
through saying we had to leave for Tirana as soon as possible and 
if we did not go, they would make us go,'' he said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spahiu said many people climbed on buses, but he and others  
remained inconspicuous. He said he stayed because he feared his 
tractor -- the most important item his family managed to bring from 
Kosovo -- would be stolen in Tirana, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	While Franquin said the UNHCR would protest the forced removals,  
it also understood the desire of Kukes authorities to clear out as 
many refugees as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Some officials warn that Kukes' water supply will be sharply  
reduced when spring rains end and the dry summer begins. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say that this number of refugees is not sustainable,''  
Franquin said.

<HEADLINE> Biweekly Mortgages: An Alternative? / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There are at least a couple ways some homeowners  
can cut mortgage costs: 
</P>
<P>
	They can sign up for a mortgage acceleration program, where  
payments are electronically deducted from their bank accounts 
biweekly. One extra payment is essentially made each year, thereby 
slashing interest costs by shortening the life of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, they can add a little something extra to their regular  
monthly payments on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Both accomplish long-term savings, only most biweekly plans  
offered to existing homeowners charge anywhere from $200 to $600 in 
start-up costs, along with small monthly administrative fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say that's a waste of money, plus borrowers are locked  
into a stricter payment schedule. But plan administrators maintain 
most people lack the discipline to make extra payments on their 
own, and whatever fee is charged, is a small price for something 
that ultimately could save loads of money. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenders have been pushing the prepayment strategy lately, and a  
growing number of third-party collection companies have been 
springing up to cash in on this hot home loan product. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lenders have even promoted biweekly mortgages as a  
less-expensive alternative to refinancing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're sitting on a 7.25 percent loan and the current rate  
is 6.75 percent, it's probably not worth refinancing for only half 
a percentage point,'' said Keith Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH 
Associates, a Butler, N.J.-based mortgage research firm 
(www.hsh.com). 
</P>
<P>
	``Lenders promote the biweekly package as something that can  
shorten the term of the loan and save money ... and all it costs is 
a one-time start-up fee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of making the usual 12 monthly payments per year,  
borrowers make 26 twice-monthly payments, each of which is half the 
size of the regular monthly payments. That adds up to 13 full 
payments a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The savings can be considerable for 30-year mortgages, as  
Gumbinger noted in these examples: 
</P>
<P>
	On a $100,000 30-year loan at 7 3/8 percent, the monthly payment is  
$690.68 in interest and principal (taxes and insurance not 
included). Total interest payment over the life of the loan: 
$148,644.80. 
</P>
<P>
	In a biweekly plan, borrowers pay $345.34 each two-week period.  
Total interest payment: $110,002.80. 
</P>
<P>
	By adding an extra payment each year, the life of the loan is  
shortened by 6.6 years, making it a 23.4-year loan. The savings: 
$38,642. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of the drawback, though, is that it costs you money to  
save you money,'' Gumbinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's what bothers critics of such plans.  
</P>
<P>
	By merely adding $57.55 to each regular monthly payment in the  
scenario Gumbinger described, borrowers can realize virtually the 
same savings on their own -- provided, of course, there are no 
prepayment penalties and borrowers stay in their homes long enough. 
</P>
<P>
	While cutting mortgage expenses is advantageous, some financial  
advisers maintain consumers might do better paying off taxable debt 
and debt with higher interest rates before the family mortgage, 
where rates have been historically low in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biweekly program is a very complicated way to achieve a  
simple goal,'' said Peter G. Miller, author of several home-buying 
books and operator of a consumer information Web site 
(www.ourbroker.com). 
</P>
<P>
	Miller worries about fraud, particularly among third-party  
collectors. ``Biweekly consultants appear to be largely or totally 
unregulated. How do you know that the payments sent to a third 
party will actually be delivered to your lender?,'' he wrote in his 
book ``The Common-Sense Mortgage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says most lenders provide biweekly programs solely for  
competitive reasons -- it's a separate product they can offer -- even 
though they pose administrative headaches. There are 26 payments to 
record each year, and therefore, 26 chances to enter the wrong 
information on a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	One mortgage lender offering biweekly payment options is  
Homerica Mortgage Corp. of Harrison, N.Y. Unlike many others, 
Homerica offers them only at origination, so there are no start-up 
or administrative fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Around 20 percent of customers opt for them, according to Bruce  
Lublin, Homerica president. One advantage, he says, is that they're 
easier to qualify for than conventional 15-year and 20-year loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rates are also lower ... about a quarter of a point,''  
Lublin said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what sold John and Rosemary Labozza of Osning, N.Y., on  
the idea as they were buying their $411,000 four-bedroom Colonial 
last winter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labozzas received a $260,000 mortgage at 6 7/8 percent under  
the biweekly plan. At the time, the rate for a conventional 30-year 
mortgage to be repaid monthly was 7 1/8. Their total savings: 
$101,872.18 in interest, plus the mortgage is repaid seven years 
early. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking to reduce my payment as best as I could and that  
was the best way for me,'' said Labozza, a 48-year-old engineer.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Holds Alliance Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Javier Solana, the Spanish socialist who once  
campaigned against NATO bases in his native country, has been a key 
figure in holding the alliance together during its greatest 
military challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	As the bombing of Yugoslavia enters its second month, the 19  
alliance members appear united in their determination to persist 
until President Slobodan Milosevic yields. 
</P>
<P>
	Though few admit it publicly, many at NATO hoped that a few days  
of bombing would be sufficient. When it wasn't, the potential for 
fracture was high. But the North Atlantic Council, the alliance 
policy-making body chaired by Solana, moved ahead with what many 
now predict will be a long air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana, 56, a former foreign minister of Spain under Prime  
Minister Felipe Gonzalez, took over at NATO in December 1995. He 
came directly from a six-month tour at the 15-nation European 
Union, where he headed the EU Council during Spain's turn at the 
rotating EU presidency and won praise for his skill at negotiation 
and compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	He took over NATO's leadership at a difficult time in the  
alliance's history. Willy Claes of Belgium had just been indicted 
for corruption for previous activities in his home country. The 
early front-runner to replace him, former Dutch Prime Minister Ruud 
Lubbers, was rejected by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana, a dapper physicist with a short salt-and-pepper beard,  
was the more than acceptable second choice. 
</P>
<P>
	He is popular among the ambassadors who make up the North  
Atlantic Council and has the support of the White House. And while 
grumbling is frequently heard among diplomats about the NATO staff 
in Brussels, it rarely includes Solana. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is an extraordinary consensus-builder who works behind the  
scenes with leaders on both sides of the Atlantic to ensure that 
NATO is united when it counts,'' said Alexander Vershbow, the 
American ambassador to NATO. ``A good example is Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noted Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen: ``He has been  
most effective and has made an enormous contribution'' to 
maintaining alliance cohesion. ``The way he put together the 
upgrading of all options was excellent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solana took over the same day that NATO led 60,000 troops from  
30 nations into Bosnia to implement the Dayton peace agreement. 
That operation is continuing, though at a lower level with about 
30,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Kosovo crisis, the allies gave Solana latitude in  
moving from Phase I of the bombing campaign in Yugoslavia to a more 
intense Phase II, requiring only informal consultation. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana holds a doctorate in physics. He was a Fulbright scholar  
at several American universities and taught solid-state physics at 
Madrid's Complutense University. He joined the Spanish Socialist 
Party in 1964 and was elected a member of Parliament in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of an illustrious Spanish family, Solana moved from the  
antimilitarism and radicalism of his student days in the early 
1960s under the regime of Gen. Francisco Franco to foreign minister 
of a staunchly pro-NATO government in Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana, who served in the Spanish Cabinet from 1982-95, says his  
early attitudes opposing American bases in Spain came from his 
student years in the United States during the unrest over Vietnam 
and civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary-general's term ends at the end of this year. While  
he might stay on beyond the end of the year, if asked, he is not 
expected to seek a new, four-year term.

<HEADLINE> Valhol Handlers Threaten Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The owner and trainer of Arkansas Derby  
winner Valhol say they plan legal action next week if the state 
doesn't distribute the winner's $300,000 purse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like we'll be filing a lawsuit,'' said William  
Rambicure of Lexington, Ky., a lawyer for Valhol owner James D. 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Q. Byrum Hurst Jr. of Hot Springs, Ark., a lawyer for Valhol  
trainer Dallas Keen, said he hopes the state Racing Commission will 
distribute the money by Wednesday, the day horses are entered for 
the May 1 Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	But if not, he said, ``I'm going to do whatever we have to do to  
see that the racing commission abides by its own rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the rules require the commission to distribute the purse  
within 96 hours of the race. If a problem arises later, he said, 
the money can be returned and redistributed. 
</P>
<P>
	Byron Freeland, lawyer for the Racing Commission, said he  
anticipates legal action by Valhol's handlers next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Churchill Downs allows up to 20 horses to enter the Kentucky  
Derby. If more than 20 enter, it takes the top 20 earners of money 
won in graded stakes races. 
</P>
<P>
	Vahol won't qualify as a top-20 earner without the $300,000. And  
Churchill Downs won't recognize Valhol as the Arkansas Derby winner 
until the money is officially awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	The racing commission held up distribution of the purse because  
of a question over whether jockey Billy Patin was carrying an 
illegal electrical device in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hurst said, ``You don't punish the innocent parties -- the  
horse and the owner and the trainer -- for something he (Patin) may 
or may not have done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewards at Oaklawn Park had set a hearing for Monday to  
consider whether Patin violated racing regulations. But Patin's 
lawyer, J. Minos Simon of Lafayette, La., asked for a delay and the 
hearing was reset for May 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Patin has denied using the device, called a ``machine'' or  
``buzzer.'' Both Keen and Jackson have said the jockey has told 
them he didn't do anything wrong and they have supported him.

<HEADLINE> NHL Says Penguins May Be Dissolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The NHL, growing impatient with the ponderous  
pace of the Pittsburgh Penguins' bankruptcy case, on Friday said 
the franchise is in danger of being dissolved if a reorganization 
plan isn't in place by May 31. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz, also wearying of  
proceedings that began in October, is believed to side with the 
league's position. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL did not formally ask the court for permission to fold  
the team, but May 31 was mentioned prominently in documents filed 
Friday supporting former Penguins star Mario Lemieux's 
reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really did want to put everybody on notice that we are  
dealing with time constraints here,'' NHL counsel William Daly 
said. ``Our perspective is there is a practical deadline here ... 
If Mario's plan is not confirmed by that date, the league is going 
to be in a position to have to do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the NHL constitution, the league could choose to operate  
the team on its own, something it already has said it will not do. 
The league also could order the franchise to be dissolved or sold 
to another city. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want a healthy, viable, successful franchise for Pittsburgh  
for the long term. It's a great hockey city,'' Daly said. ``But 
there is a practical deadline that must be met and, if no plan is 
confirmed, there is no way for this franchise to operate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL wants the Penguins' situation settled soon so it can  
begin formulating the 1999-2000 schedule and, if a reorganization 
plan is accepted, so the Penguins can make payroll decisions and 
begin selling tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The league went on record for the first time Friday in  
supporting Lemieux's ownership bid, saying it has great merit. But 
the league has concerns about potentially optimistic revenue 
projects, the lack of a new arena lease and, according to league 
sources, provisions that call for Lemieux to be repaid most of the 
$32 million he is owed in deferred payments. 
</P>
<P>
	In most bankruptcy cases, unsecured creditors such as Lemieux  
are paid only pennies on the dollar, not the full amount they are 
owed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like Mario's plan, but it has some very key contingencies  
for it to work, and even Mario will tell you that,'' Daly said, 
citing, ``the lease, the secured creditors, how the players are 
treated ... there are a bunch of moving pieces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A group headed by Florida investment banker Chip Gesner, who  
once was involved with Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy's group, has 
said it would file a reorganization plan. But the NHL is believed 
to be discouraging it so Lemieux can move forward. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest stumbling block to any bankruptcy settlement is  
negotiating a more favorable lease to replace the $6 million to $7 
million-a-year rent now paid to Spectacor Management Group. The 
Penguins pay the NHL's highest rent despite playing in the league's 
oldest building, the 38-year-old Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Spectacor twice renegotiated the lease with Howard Baldwin, the  
team's primary owner from 1991-97, and has not yet shown any 
inclination to do so again. But Spectacor now faces the real threat 
of managing a building that may lose its primary tenant unless 
financial relief is forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL's decision to press the matter may spur creditors to  
step up the pressure on all sides to work out an acceptable plan, 
especially since they would get nothing if the team is dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux has raised about $50 million to operate the team and pay  
off creditors. But critics say his revenue projections are overly 
optimistic, especially those foreseeing an $8 million profit in the 
first year of operation. The Penguins expect to lose $10 million 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, lawyers for Penguins co-owner Roger Marino said they  
will not contest the Lemieux reorganization, although it contains 
no provision for Marino to maintain a stake in the team. 
</P>
<P>
	That decision could be a sign that Marino is unwilling to devote  
any more time or money into the Penguins after investing $42 
million since February 1997.

<HEADLINE> Long Island Lolita Could Be Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) -- Amy Fisher, the ``Long Island Lolita'' who  
shot her lover's wife in a jealous rage and inspired several 
television movies, may soon be paroled after a judge agreed to give 
her a shorter prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fisher, now 24, was 16 when she shot Mary Jo Buttafuoco in  
the head. She had been having sex with Mrs. Buttafuoco's husband, 
Joey, who later served six months in jail for statutory rape. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened to you -- it wasn't your husband's fault ... it  
wasn't my father's fault. It was my fault and I'm sorry,'' Ms. 
Fisher said Thursday in a barely audible voice, looking directly at 
Mrs. Buttafuoco in the courtroom.

<P>
	As Ms. Fisher walked past Mrs. Buttafuoco, they brushed fingers  
and the younger woman mouthed, ``I'm sorry,'' holding back tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through faith in God I am able to forgive,'' Mrs. Buttafuoco  
said. ``It did not come easily or quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The saga made headlines for months and led to three separate  
television movies. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers, both sides contend that Ms. Fisher had  
ineffective legal counsel when she pleaded guilty to first-degree 
assault and was sentenced to 5 to 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Ira Wexner threw out Ms. Fisher's 1992 guilty plea,  
allowed her to re-enter a plea to the same charge, and then 
resentenced her to 3 1/2 to 10 1/2 years. She has already served seven 
years of the original sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	She will be interviewed by the state Parole Board on May 3. If  
the board approves, she could be freed that week. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are still a young woman and could be a productive member  
of society if you channel your energies,'' Wexner told her. ``Based 
on the information I have received, I believe you can do that.''
