<HEADLINE> US Trade Deficit Down Sharply to 8.5 Bln Dlrs in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department
announced today that the U.S. trade deficit declined sharply in
March to 8.5 billion U.S. dollars as the country's exports hit an
all-time high.
</P>
<P>
The department said in its monthly report that the deficit in
goods and services was the lowest it has been since last November
and took a big-margin drop of 19.3 percent from an imbalance of
10.5 billion dollars in February.
</P>
<P>
Exports of U.S. goods and services climbed up to a record 76.5
billion dollars in March as compared with 73.5 billion dollars in
the previous month. Meanwhile, imports also rose to a record,
surging to 85 billion dollars from February's 84 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Japan was up in March by 8.3 percent to 4.6
billion dollars, the highest since last November, due to increased
imports of Japanese computers and telephone equipment.
</P>
<P>
For March, the deficit with Mexico rose 23.2 percent to 1.5
billion dollars, the worst showing since last November. The
deficit with Canada was down 13.5 percent to 1.3 billion dollars.
U.S. exports to Canada and imports from that country were both at
the highest levels ever recorded by the United States in trade
with any country.
</P>
<P>
U.S. exports to all of Central and South America rose to a
record 5.2 billion dollars in March.
</P>
<P>
America's foreign oil bill edged up a slight 0.3 percent in
March to 5.3 billion dollars as a 13 percent jump in volume was
offset by a decline in price. Crude oil prices dropped to an
average of 18.72 dollars per barrel, down from 20.49 dollars in
February.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department suffered a major embarrassment last
month when it initially overstated the February deficit by 1.2
billion dollars as a result of incorrectly mixed old oil reports
into the February report.
</P>
<P>
Even with the improvement in March, the trade deficit in the
first three months of this year has been running at an annual rate
of 125.5 billion dollars, a deterioration from last year's total
deficit of 114.3 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> France Urges Zaire's New Leaders to Hold Free Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- France has presented a four-point
message to Zaire's new authorities under Laurent Kabila, calling
for free elections and protection of French nationals in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
It follows the assassination of two French businessmen in
Kinshasa on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The French government decided on the message at a meeting
chaired by President Jacques Chirac this morning, said French
Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
In the message, France urged the new authorities in Zaire to
"conform themselves with the rules of democracy," and asked them
to "organize, very rapidly, free elections, observed by the
international community."
</P>
<P>
While expressing sorrow over the assassination of two
Frenchmen, France "demands very firmly that measures be taken for
assuring the security of the French community" in Zaire, the
spokesman quoted from the message.
</P>
<P>
Michel Tournaire and Herve Riguaud, two French businessmen who
had long lived in Zaire, were killed by two gunmen wearing
military uniforms at a factory near central Kinshasa, under
circumstances which are as yet unclear.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said today in a radio
interview that he did not think the assassination was a
retaliation over French policy towards Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The government also expressed deep worry over the plight of
Rwandan refugees and displaced people in Zaire, and urged the new
leaders of Kinshasa to guarantee security on the borders between
Zaire and its neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
France was apparently referring to Zaire's borders with
neighboring Congo and the Central African Republic, two countries
which have supported President Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
The French ambassador in Kinshasa, Michel Rougagnou, will "make
contact with the new authorities of the Democratic Republic of
Congo, at the highest level", said Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
De Charette also expressed shock over what he called the
"indifference" of the international community over the situation
of Rwandan refugees in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"Thousands and thousands of men, women and children have been
abandoned. There is an international inquiry which was demanded by
the United Nations, and I say here that the U.N. cannot today
accomplish its work in the field," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The international humanitarian group Medecins sans Frontieres
said on Monday that 190,000 Hutu refugees had disappeared from
eastern Zaire over the past several months.
</P>
<P>
"The latest reports which we have received are extremely
worrying. We ask instantly that the non-governmental organizations
as well as an envoy of the United Nations can go into the field
and investigate immediately," said Rummelhardt.

<HEADLINE> Tonkov Wins Fifth Stage in Giro d'Italia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Pavel Tonkov beat
Luc Leblanc and Marco Pantani in a four-way sprint in the first
tough mountainous stage of the Giro d'Italia on Wednesday,
retaining the pink jersey and strengthening his overall lead.
</P>
<P>
Tonkov's fifth-stage victory put considerable distance between
himself and most of his main rivals, who finished well behind in
the leg which ended at Terminello peak, 1,675 meters above sea
level after a final 15-kilometer climb.
</P>
<P>
Russian Eugeni Berzin, the 1994 Giro champion and the main
rival of the 28-year-old Tonkov, trailed by more than five
minutes, possibly compromising his chances to win the 22-stage
marathon.
</P>
<P>
Most cyclists failed on the final climb to Terminillo,
northeast of Rome, after the 215-kilometer stage from Arezzo, in
Tuscany, was marred by rain. Leblanc rushed ahead 200 meters from
the finish line but Tonkov was quick to respond and overtake him.
</P>
<P>
The second-place finish moved the Frenchman from fourth to
second place overall.
</P>
<P>
The Tour of Italy, which ends in Milan on June 8, continues
Thursday with a 210-kilometer hilly stage from Rieti to Lanciano.

BONN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
said today that Germany is prepared to cooperate with the leader
of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that the country's future ties with Bonn would
depend on its democratization and free elections.
</P>
<P>
"Germany is, in principle, prepared to cooperate with the new
government in Kinshasa. Our European partners have the same
policy," said Kinkel in a statement issued in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
He said Germany accepted Kabila's pledges to hold free
elections within the next 12 months, and stressed that the pledges
must be followed by action.
</P>
<P>
"We will make our further cooperation with Kabila's government
dependent on implementation of the announced democratization steps
which must end up with a free, general elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
If the country was to succeed in its new start, there should be
no further acts of revenge as had taken place in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Kabila announced on May 17 that he would be president of Zaire after
toppling former president, Mobuto Sese Seko.

<HEADLINE> Balanced-Budget Plan Narrowly Passes US House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives decisively approved a balanced budget agreement
early today after a marathon debate, narrowly defeating a proposal
to boost highway spending that could have disrupted the accord.
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 333 to 99 a few hours before dawn, the House
approved the plan to balance the federal budget by 2002 which was
reached on May 2 by the Clinton administration and the Republican
leaders in the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
Critics of the agreement said that the package gives tax breaks
to the wealthy and neglects programs to help children and rebuild
highways and bridges. They proposed a move to add 12 billion
dollars to the 125-billion-dollar plan in highway spending already
contained in the balanced-budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
Pleas from the White House and Republican leaders helped turn
away a surprisingly strong challenge to amend the pact by
increasing transportation spending.
</P>
<P>
The Republican leadership and the White House launched an
intense campaign in the past few days to defeat an amendment to
boost spending on highway projects.
</P>
<P>
It was the first substantial political test of an agreement
that seeks a balanced budget by 2002 as well as 85 billion dollars
in net tax cuts and a reduction of 115 billion dollars in Medicare
spending.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the balanced-budget agreement will also meet with
strong opposition in the U.S. Senate. Another significant change
proposed to amend the agreement would boost cigarette taxes to
expand health coverage for uninsured children and further cut the
budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
By raising the cigarette tax by 43 cents a pack, the proposal
would raise 20 billion dollars for children's insurance and 10
billion to reduce the deficit.
</P>
<P>
The strong opposition to the balanced-budget agreement, mainly
from Democrats in the U.S. Congress, is a clear evidence that
there is a deep gap between the two parties on the pact.

WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today announced
the approval of a 325 million U.S. dollar assistance package to
India for an irrigation project to boost Andhra Pradesh's
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The package includes a 175 million loan which will be provided
by the International Bank For Reconstruction and Development and a
150 million dollar credit which will be channeled through the
International Development Association, the World Bank's
concessionary lending arm.
</P>
<P>
The project will increase the agricultural productivity of more
than 310,000 hectares and therefore raise the income of mostly
marginal and small farmers.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is estimated at some 477.43
million dollars. In addition to the World Bank's financing, the
government of Andhra Pradesh will contribute the remaining 152.43
million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriot Side to Attend Direct Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Cypriot side will enter
direct talks in all seriousness in order to reach a solution to
the Cyprus problem, government spokesman Manolis Christofides
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, the spokesman said "our
message is that within the U.N. framework and taking into
consideration reaffirmations of interested parties for assistance,
we will go to direct talks and cooperate fully with the
U.N. Secretary General for a solution to the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
It seems, Christofides said, there will be three rounds of
direct talks, the first of which will last between seven to 10
days.
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, that the Cypriot government has not yet
had an official confirmation from the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been carrying out proximity talks with the
Greek and Turkish sides in Cyprus since March, aimed at
preparing the ground for direct negotiations between President
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is expected to issue
invitations soon to Clerides and Denktash for face-to-face
negotiations, scheduled to take place in New York at the end of
June or in the beginning of July.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved since 1974 when
the island was divided after Turkish troops occupied its
northern third in the wake of an Athens-backed coup seeking union
with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Mobutu Followers Leave for Chad to Seek Asylum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of followers of Zaire's ousted
president Mobutu Sese Seko left the Togolese capital of Lome today
for Chad, whose government has agreed to receive them, the Agence
France-Presse (AFP) news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu will also go to Chad as soon as his health allows him
to do so, AFP quoted reliable sources in Lome as saying.
</P>
<P>
Two aircraft, including one of the Congolese air company Lima
Congo, transported about 85 members of Mobutu's followers to
Ndjamena, the capital of Chad, from Lome, where they were refused
entry by the local authorities, said Togolese officials.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu has been housed in the presidential palace of Lome for
"humanitarian reason" since he fled there Sunday morning, Togolese
Foreign Minister Koffi Panou said.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu, who was in power for more than 30 years, was forced to
flee into exile after the forces led by Laurent Kabila entered
Kinshasa, Zaire's capital.
</P>
<P>
Kabila proclaimed himself president of the country whose name
he changed to "the Democratic Republic of Congo."
</P>
<P>
Kabila flew to Kinshasa Tuesday from his southern stronghold of
Lubumbashi to form an interim government.

<HEADLINE> US Plans to Pay Off UN Dues Stalls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration's
proposal to pay 1 billion U.S. dollars dues it owed to the United
nations has stalled in Congress, the New York Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Republicans are insisting on paying only some of the debt, over
a longer stretch of time and only after the U.N. agrees to a
series of demands, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. owed the U.N. more than 15 billion U.S. dollars and
remains the largest debtor among the U.N. members. Earlier this
year, President Bill Clinton promised to pay the debt.
</P>
<P>
Proposals circulating in the House and the Senate raised a
series of conditions for paying the arrears, including a reduction
of Washington's annual dues, and more reforms in the U.N., the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to say it loud and clear: the arrears will be paid
only when the reforms are made," it quoted one senator as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The administration, in quiet negotiations with Republican
leaders, has opposed many of the conditions," it added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been widely criticized by many countries,
including its allies, for not paying its U.N. dues in time.

<HEADLINE> British officials, Sinn Fein Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army's (IRA)
political wing Sinn Fein and British officials began talks today
on the Northern Ireland peace process, the first such meeting
since the IRA ended its ceasefire in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, in the Ulster capital of Belfast, was between
Martin McGuinness, chief negotiator for Sinn Fein, and civil
servants.
</P>
<P>
"From our point of view in Sinn Fein there is a very strong
desire to break the impasse and to move forward to a fair and just
political settlement on this island," McGuinness told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"You will also appreciate that we are dealing now with a new
British government which has inherited the present situation," he
added.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair offered to ease a ban on
official contact with Sinn Fein last week, putting new life into
the stalled Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
The IRA has waged guerrilla war since 1969 to end the British
rule of Northern Ireland and merge it with Ireland proper. But the
60 percent Protestant population in Northern Ireland favors
continued ties with Britain.
</P>
<P>
Although official talks were resumed, Sinn Fein has been barred
by the British government from having a seat in the multi-party
peace talks to be resumed on June 3.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams today urged the British government
to state "with absolute clarity" that Sinn Fein would immediately
be allowed to attend the talks if the IRA called a ceasefire.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Remains Second on Competitiveness Ranking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong still holds the second
place in the global competitiveness, a little over a month before
its sovereignty is returned to China, according to a new ranking
issued by the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
The ranking was based on a survey of 3,000 chief executive
officers of big companies of different countries by the
Geneva-based business research organization. Among the 53
economies rated, Singapore again ranks first on the list,
according to the survey. New Zealand gave up its third place to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Our survey indicated that business leaders held the belief
that Hong Kong will maintain its attractiveness and
competitiveness after the transition of sovereignty this year,"
said Frederick Hu, director of the Global Competitiveness Report.
</P>
<P>
China has moved ahead to 29th place from the 36th. But in the
market growth ranking prepared also by the organization, China
moved further ahead from the fourth to the second place.
</P>
<P>
"China still had the world's fastest growing economy last
year, and it attracted more foreign direct investment than any
other country except the U.S.," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the survey, Jeffrey Sachs, an economist from
Harvard University and a key player in the worldwide survey, said
that there has been mixed progress towards improved economic
competitiveness among the major economies of the world. On the
whole, he said, the state of the world economy is good -- in some
ways better than at any time in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
In nearly all parts of the world, the professor said,
governments have taken important strides to open national
economies to international trade and finance; to get high rates of
inflation under control; and to improve physical infrastructure to
enhance the national economy.
</P>
<P>
But countries in the European Union are laboring under a
chronic fiscal crisis, high unemployment and relatively slow
growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Eastern Europe, Russia slipped to the last place from the
49th. Ukraine ranks the 52nd place.
</P>
<P>
The surveyors said that only nine out of the 53 countries and
regions showed even mild concerns over the chances of recession.
The highest likelihood of recession was judged to be in Colombia.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain improved its competitiveness
in the past year and now outranks the rest of the European Union,
according to a report published today.
</P>
<P>
The report by the World Economic Forum (WEF) said that the
success of long-term restructuring measures such as privatization
and deregulation had helped Britain make the leap from 15th place
last year.
</P>
<P>
The forum said Britain has recovered from relative economic
decline to become "the envy of continental Europe."
</P>
<P>
Britain's success in overhauling its welfare state, cutting tax
rates, increasing labor market flexibility and achieving sustained
growth with falling unemployment received particular praise.
</P>
<P>
The WEF's annual Global Competitiveness Report seeks to
determine which countries have the greatest ability to achieve
sustained high rates of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The report ranks 53 countries, which are responsible for more
than 90 percent of the world's industrial output, using 153
criteria, ranging from infrastructure and technology through to
business management and regulation.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, it says, continental EU members are suffering "a
chronic crisis of declining competitiveness" caused by rigid labor
markets, burdensome social welfare systems and high levels of
government spending.
</P>
<P>
The forum rates the other EU members only just above Latin
American economies.
</P>
<P>
But the findings were downplayed by Gordon Brown, the
chancellor, who said, "If that were true, I would welcome it."
</P>
<P>
Brown said on BBC Today program, "The accepted indicator of
where we are in the world prosperity league is the OECD, and we
are 21st."
</P>
<P>
"Singapore and Hong Kong were first and second in the table for
the second year running, with the WEF commending the two for their
all-round competitive economies.

LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain's economic competitiveness
soared to seventh in the world in 1996, from the 15th in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
It topped the European Union (EU) countries, a report from the
World Economic Forum (WEF) said today.
</P>
<P>
The annual Global Competitiveness Report, surveying 53 better
developed countries on their ability to achieve sustained economic
growth, attributed Britain's leap to its long-term economic
restructuring, including privatization and deregulation.
</P>
<P>
It said Britain was particularly successful in overhauling its
welfare state, cutting tax rates, increasing labor market
flexibility and achieving sustained growth with falling
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
But British Chancellor of Exchequer Gordon Brown played down
the recommendation of the WEF, a Geneva-based non-governmental
annual forum.
</P>
<P>
"If that were true, I would welcome it," Brown said on the BBC
Today program. "The accepted indicator of where we are in the
world prosperity league is the Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), and we are the 21st."

<HEADLINE> UK Prime Minister to Take Tough Action if MP Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said today he would take tough action against one of the Labor MPs
if the allegations of bribery against the MP turn out to be true.
</P>
<P>
A newspaper has recently reported that Mohammed Sarwar, who won
a seat in the May 1 general election as Britain's first Moslem MP,
had bribed a rival candidate in the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Sarwar has admitted giving a 5,000-pound (8,270-dollar) loan to
a candidate in the Glasgow Govan constituency but denied any kind
of bribery. Police are already looking into the allegations
against Sarwar and the Executive set up a three-person committee
to conduct its own investigation.
</P>
<P>
Blair told Labor's National Executive his party had set itself
very high standards.
</P>
<P>
"We did that deliberately, very deliberately, and we must meet
them," an aide quoted Blair as saying at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The claims against 44-year-old Sarwar, a Parkistani-born
millionaire, are the first dark cloud to gather over the new
government, which was helped to its landslide victory in the May 1
election by a number of allegations of financial and sex scandals
against Conservative politicians.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Ban Landmine Manufacture, Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said today his government will ban the import, export and
manufacture of landmines.
</P>
<P>
An official statement on the ban of anti-personal mines will be
announced later, Blair told a parliament meeting.
</P>
<P>
This marks a significant change from the policy of the previous
Conservative government. The former administration, although
dedicated to destroying existing stocks of landmines, insisted on
retaining options to buy the so-called "smart mines" which destroy
themselves after a set period.
</P>
<P>
Officials said Britain intended to sign up to the so-called
Ottawa Process, a Canadian initiative which groups 50 nations who
want to sign a treaty by the end of this year to ban the
production, stockpiling, export and use of mines.
</P>
<P>
Britain would destroy all its stocks of anti-personnel
landmines by 2005 and would scrap the idea of replacing them with
smart mines, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> 1997 Southern Africa Economic Summit Opens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A three-day 1997 southern Africa
economic summit started in Harare this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 regional and international business leaders are
attending the summit. They will discuss the regional
integration, trade, infrastructure development, improving the the
region's competitiveness and privatization.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe
said despite southern Africa's political achievements, the region
still shouldered a burden of poverty as the standard of living
was being eroded each year by one percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the fruits of the liberation struggles mounted by the
different countries of the region should be transformed into
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, after political security, justice, peace and
democracy, our people still hunger for economic emancipation and
prosperity," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 12 states of the Southern Africa Development Community
(SADC) with a collective population of 140 million have
experienced an economic growth rate of about three percent
annually. But the economic growth rate, matched with a three
percent population growth rate, has been blamed for the one
percent erosion of living standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe added,"our political vision for southern Africa is thus
one to create a regional organisational entity which will ensure
increasing living standards for all its citizens under conditions
of peace, political security and democracy."
</P>
<P>
The envisaged regional prosperity should not, however, be
confined to southern Africa, but should be experienced in the
rest of the continent.
</P>
<P>
At the same occasion, South African president Nelson Mandela
emphasised the need for southern African countries to work
together, saying no one country can succeed on its own.
</P>
<P>
He said the region also had to forge a strong partnership with
the international community for it to achieve its economic growth
targets.
</P>
<P>
He also said SADC had to promote partnerships that were
essential to achieving the region's development goals in the
current era.
</P>
<P>
The region, he said, should also place emphasis on the
investment skills and technology and adding value to primary
commodities.
</P>
<P>
Joint ventures between the countries in the region and
developed nations was one best answer for promoting economic
growth in Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
The summit was convened by the World Economic Forum and SADC.
</P>
<P>
Other regional leaders attending the summit are Zambia's
president Frederick Chiluba and Botswana's president Ketumile
Masire, Swazi prime minister Barnabas Dhlamini and Mozambican
premier Pascoal Mocumbi.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Calls for Resuming Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
today called for a resumption of peace negotiations with Syria so
as to resolve the problems in south Lebanon, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Weizman told Israel Radio that there were only two options to
solve the problems in Lebanon, either a large military operation,
or serious negotiations with Syria, which has stationed a large
number of troops inside Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli president said "it is time now" to deal with
the problems in south Lebanon, where Israeli troops have
been clashing continuously with the Hezbollah fighters.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "basically the solution is a political
one," which calls for negotiations with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's remarks came amid a marked escalation in fighting
in the Israeli self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
between Israeli troops and Hezbollah fighters.
</P>
<P>
The latest incident occurred today when an Israeli soldier
was seriously wounded in the "security zone" in a roadside
explosion as an Israeli army patrol was passing by.
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning, a suicide bomber of the Amal Movement
attempted to destroy an Israel Navy gunboat; and on the night of
last Thursday, three Israeli paratroopers were killed and seven
wounded in a clash north of the zone.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Labor Party's Member of the
Knesset (Israel's parliament) Yossi Beilin said today that some
senior Israeli army officers in the Northern Command support a
unilateral Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has
insisted that the Israeli army not withdraw from Lebanon without
an agreement to prevent Hezbollah from launching raids in the
northern part of Israel.

<P>
ATHENS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Greece today expressed its "strong
opposition" to the "invasion" of Turkish troops in northern Iraq,
and called for an immediate withdrawal of the troops from the
region.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Foreign Ministry said that Turkey should stop
creating situations reminiscent of other times "at the expense of
its neighbors."
</P>
<P>
"It is with concern that the Greek government ascertains that
Turkey, while continuing to occupy part of the Cyprus Republic,
has formulated a repetitive practice which deals a blow to
international legality and threatens the stability of the border
region," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also called on Turkey to respect the territorial
integrity, sovereignty and security of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's envoy to Greece, Issam Khalil, today appealed to the
international community and the Greek government to condemn the
Turkish thrust into northern Iraq and the policy of "double
Standards" in international relations.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Rules Out War With Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean defence minister Moven
Mahachi today ruled out the possibility of a war breaking out
with Zambia over disputed islands along their common border on
the Zambezi river.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency ZIANA in Nyanga
after officiating at the end of a four-week joint training course
for 250 British and 205 Zimbabwean special army units, Mahachi
said Zimbabwe was optimistic the dispute would be resolved
amicably without resorting to the use of military force.
</P>
<P>
"Zambia is a friendly country to Zimbabwe. We don't think we
can be drawn to war with it. If dispute continues, we will go for
international arbitration but i don't think we will reach that
far because the maps and beacons are there," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "it's just a question of identifying the beacons and
resolve the matter. Our surveyor general's office would be
involved in identifying which islands belong to Zimbabwe and
which ones do not."
</P>
<P>
He said a meeting for security officials from both countries
was held in the Zambian resort town of Livingstone at the weekend
to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to disclose the outcome of the meeting
but was emphatic that should the dispute persist, Zimbabwe would
opt for international arbitration.
</P>
<P>
He said before seeking international arbitration, the two
countries were trying to resolve the issue through their
ministries of foreign affairs and other related ministries.

<P>
BONN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Germany's leading far-right political
party vowed today to fight the European single currency, the euro,
saying this would be its main election issue in Autumn 1998.
</P>
<P>
Rolf Schlierer, chairman of the Republicans Party, told
reporters in Bonn: "I firmly believe that (the euro) will be the
election issue in 1998". Schlierer said the party was currently
distributing millions of anti-euro brochures.
</P>
<P>
The euro is scheduled to be launched from 1999, and replace the
mark and other European currencies from 2002.
</P>
<P>
The major parties in Bonn, in or out of office, all back the
euro. However, opinion polls have two-thirds of German voters
objecting to giving up the mark for it.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Guerrillas Attack Israeli patrol in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Muslim guerrillas today
launched a bombing attack on an Israeli infantry patrol inside the
Israeli-occupied border strip in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that at least one Israeli soldier was
wounded in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas detonated a roadside bomb near the village of Arnoun
in Nabatiyeh area inside the Israeli self-proclaimed "security
zone," when an Israeli patrol comprising six soldiers were passing
by.
</P>
<P>
At least one Israeli soldier was injured in the blast, the
anonymous security sources added.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the attack in a statement, saying that its
fighters detonated the bomb at 8:45 a.m. (0545 GMT) on the road
between Arnoun and Al-Khardali, targeting the Israeli foot patrol.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite Muslim organization, which spearheads a guerrilla
warfare to oust the Israeli occupation forces from the Lebanese
land, stressed that "a certain number of Israeli soldiers were
killed or wounded."
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the guerrilla operation, Israeli artillery
bombarded the vicinities of Mazraa Hamra and Arnoun in the morning
without causing casualties, according to the security sources.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources noted that today's clash came within the
scope of daily exchanges of fire between Muslim guerrillas and the
Israeli occupation forces on the last active battlefront of the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Nine Israeli soldiers have been killed and more than 40 others
wounded by Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon since the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state established the 1,100-square-kilometer
"security zone" in 1985 to protect northern Israel
from cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, during a tour of the occupation zone
Tuesday, Israel defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai reiterated his
government's claim that Iran is sending weapons to Hezbollah via
Syria, and vowed to continue its fight against the Iranian-backed
guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Africa Told to Reduce Military Budgets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 21 (Xinhua) -- African countries should seriously
consider reducing military budgets as a first step towards
averting conflicts, a Zambian parliamentarian said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing over 150 delegates attending the 28th Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association (CPA) Africa region conference,
Frederick Hapunda said cutting down on military expenditure
would help reduce the incidence of conflicts on the continent.
</P>
<P>
"This should be the first step so that more resources are
allocated to the economic development of each nation," said
Hapunda.
</P>
<P>
Hapunda said conflict resolution in Africa could be championed
by regional groupings before involving the Organisation of Africa
Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
The southern African development community last year launched
an organ on politics, defence and security under the chairmanship
of Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe to monitor and maintain
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Then regional organisations in Africa should try to resolve
conflicts within their localities through mediation, conciliation
or artitration, not by armed intervention," he said.

<HEADLINE> Commentary Supports State Ban on Stock Speculation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A short commentary issued here
today supports a central government regulation that bans
state-owned enterprises and listed companies from stock
speculation.
</P>
<P>
The regulation was jointly issued by the State Council's
Securities Committee, the People's Bank of China, and the State
Economic and Trade Commission recently.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, titled "A good method to promote the
standardized development of the stock market," described the
regulation as an "appropriate prescription for promoting sound
growth of the state-owned enterprises and curbing over-speculation
on the stock market."
</P>
<P>
The commentary noted that it is international common practice
to restrict short-term speculation and encourage long-term
investment in the stock market, which is precisely the aim of the
regulation.
</P>
<P>
The regulation stipulates explicitly that no state-owned
enterprise or listed company is allowed to purchase or sell stocks
within a fixed period of time.
</P>
<P>
The commentary urged the people to follow the instructions of
the Party Central Committee and the State Council, adhere to the
state principle of "law-abiding, supervision, self-discipline, and
standardization" for the stock market operation, and enhance their
awareness of potential risks.
</P>
<P>
"Timely and effective measures should also be taken to prevent
and dissolve risks and to maintain a normal market order and
social stability, thus ensuring a sustained, rapid and sound
development for the national economy," it added.

<HEADLINE> Commentary Supports State Ban on Stock Speculation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commentary went on to say that the involvement of
state-owned enterprises and listed companies in stock speculation
has not only increased risks for their management, but also
reinforced over-speculation on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
"Those state enterprises and listed companies engaged in stock
speculation are simply not taking care of their own business," it
commented.
</P>
<P>
It conceded that China's stock market, which has been set up
for only six years, still lacks proper legal management and strict
supervision.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it is particularly necessary for the central
authorities to provide correct guidance for the development of the
market," it noted.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the recent revival of over-speculation in
China's stock market could be partly attributed to the speculative
activities of a number of state-owned enterprises and listed
companies, which used bank loans or money raised from issue of
shares to buy stocks.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of phenomenon, if tolerated, will not only affect
normal production and management and cause the loss of state
assets, but also disrupt the order of the financial and securities
markets and hurt investors' interests," the commentary said.

STOCKHOLM, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Sweden would not accept any
European Union (EU) decision on creating a border-free Europe
should it hurt the interests of non-EU nordic countries, Swedish
Prime Minister Goran Persson said today.

The EU expects to launch the Schengen Treaty in 1999, which

Last December, the five Nordic nations joined the Schengen
countries, which had already embraced 10 Western European
countries. The agreement could not take effect without
ratification by all the EU members' parliaments.
</P>

The two prime ministers agreed that Nordic cooperation should
be maintained, even though Sweden, Finland and Denmark had joined

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
today called the results of the state visit paid by President
Jacques Chirac to China last week "extremely positive."
</P>
<P>
In a brief press declaration after a meeting of the French
government chaired by Chirac, Juppe said that the visit was a
"demonstration" that "a strategy of dialogue in the field of human
rights was more effective with the Chinese than a strategy of
confrontation."
</P>
<P>
"On the economic plane, we have been able to mark important
points in a field in which competition is very strong. I am
referring to air transport, with the order of 30 Airbus and 10 ATR
planes (by China)," said Juppe.
</P>
<P>
He called on the government ministers to send a "message of
confidence" to the French voters who will cast their votes in the
legislative elections on May 25 and June 1.
</P>
<P>
"The president stressed that the spirit of enterprise, and the
spirit of conquest have come. He encouraged us... to carry a
message of confidence and growth," said the prime minister.

Republic of Congo today expressed hope to develop cooperative
ties with China.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made here today by Deogratias Bugera,
general-secretary of the Alliance of the Democratic Forces for
the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), in a meeting with Liu Yuhe,

<P>
He said the Chinese government hoped to make joint efforts
with the new government of the Democratic Republic of Congo on

<HEADLINE> Greece Calls for Successful Elections in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos today urged all political parties in Albania to make every
effort towards a successful holding of the planned June 29
elections.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said in a statement today that Athens promised to
continue offering the neighboring country every possible assistance
on the diplomatic, economic and humanitarian front.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned against allowing "partisan concerns to
thwart" what he called the historic opportunity offered by the
elections.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the international community would have to
review its position with regard to Albania "if the elections
foundered."
</P>
<P>
"If the elections were not held under free and fair conditions,
the end of Albania's troubles would not be at hand," he said.
</P>
<P>
Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos also warned Tuesday
that the failure by Albanian political parties to reach a compromise
for the elections next month would put into doubt the presence of
the Italian-led multinational force guarding aid supplies.
</P>
<P>
Greek Defense Ministry officials said that Greek troops, now
stationed in Tirana and Vlore, may also be sent to the southern town
of Gjirokaster and to abandoned customs offices on the border with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Political parties in Albania failed to reach agreement on the
electoral law passed by the parliament last week because it was
approved without the consent of the opposition parties, who
threatened to boycott the elections.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Urges Support For Kabila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 21 (Xinhua) -- South African president Nelson
Mandela, who mediated in the crisis in Zaire, today urged the
international community to give all its support to Laurent Kabila
who declared himself head of state of the now re-named Democratic
Republic of Congo following the fall of Mobutu Seso Seko.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Harare marking the end of his
three-day state visit to Zimbabwe, Mandela said he was convinced
that Kabila, who fought seven-month civil war against Mobutu, was
committed to uplift the lives of the people of his country.
</P>
<P>
"Kabila is the man destined to deliver the wishes of the
millions of people who are poor, illiterate and riddled with
disease," Mandela, flanked by his host, president Robert Mugabe
told journalists before leaving Harare for home.
</P>
<P>
"We have to support the democratic process. Kabila is going to
bring hope to millions of people in his country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He denied that in his negotiations with Kabila and Mobutu he
had been biased towards the rebel leader and his Alliance of
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also said that Kabila had shown his magnanimity in
victory by issuing a communique to his people emphasising that
Mobutu was free to live and die in the Congo with his security
full guaranteed, and that any acts of vengeance against the
ousted dictator or his sympathisers would be dealt with severely
by his new administration.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Shara's Visit to Moscow Assumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
Al-Shara flew to Moscow yesterday. His visit to the former friend
is of special importance in view of the stalled Middle East peace
process, and of the fact that Russia was one of the co-sponsors of
this process.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian diplomatic move came as Damascus tried its best to
search for alternatives to the American role in the peace process,
which has reached an impasse because of the U.S. failure to stay
firm and pressure the Netanyahu government to fulfill its
obligations.
</P>
<P>
It would not be easy to salvage the peace process without a
balanced international stance to pressure Israel to abide by
international resolutions and the Madrid conference principles.
</P>
<P>
Syria is actually seeking to enliven European and Russian roles
to bring about a balanced and effective position in face of the
U.S. stance, which has been considered to be totally aligned to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Russian attitude towards the peace process, however,
corresponds with that of the European and Arab states with regard
to the demand for implementing the U.N. resolutions and the
land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital indicate that Shara
will discuss with his Russian counterpart and other senior
officials ways and means of reactivating the Russian role in the
peace process. They will also exchange views on the current
developments in northern Iraq and examine the influences of the
Turkish-Israeli alliance on the regional countries and even on
central Asian countries. Particularly because Turkey is a NATO
member, diplomats said, the alliance will be a future threat to
Russian security.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian foreign minister will also touch upon improving
Syrian-Russian economic, trade and military relations, which have
suffered setbacks over the past years. Shara's visit assumes
greater importance especially as it will be followed by Russian
military and economic delegations to Syria to mend bilateral
relations and settle outstanding issues between the two countries,
foremost among which is Syria's 10-million-dollar debt. The major
part of it is the payment for the arms delivered to Syria during
the era of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Both Syria and Russia have the desire to improve their
political, economic and military relations and Russia is seeking
to come back to the Middle East region. Political observers here
believe Shara's visit to Russia will undoubtedly bring about
rapprochement between the two countries, particularly in the
military field.

<HEADLINE> IFC Pledges to Bolster Egypt's Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Leading experts of the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) today pledged to give a hard push to the
private sector of Egypt, which is becoming an investment magnet in
the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from the World Bank-affiliated IFC, on a week-long
visit here since May 15, discussed with government and industry
leaders on its activities in Egypt, where privatization and
investment have become a hallmark of a 15-year economic reform
drive.
</P>
<P>
Jannik Lindbaek, IFC executive vice president, hailed the
reform as building "good bases for expansion of the private sector
and attracting both portfolio and direct investment."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here today, he said that the Corporation
has expanded its activities in Egypt in response to a more
favorable environment within the country for private sector
development.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, the Corporation has approved 50
projects in Egypt totaling 750 million dollars in the sectors
ranging from tourism, steel and petrochemicals to oil and gas,
leasing and banking.
</P>
<P>
In the next few years, 150-200 million dollars will be invested
a year by IFC, the largest multilateral source of equity and loan
financing for private sector projects in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Calling Egypt one of its most active investment markets in the
Mideast, Lindbaek said IFC's strategy in Egypt is "to promote and
support this private sector development through investment in the
financial sector, infrastructure, tourism and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
The lastest effort came on Monday when IFC sets up a risk
management facility with National Bank of Egypt (NBE) to allow NBE
to offer private sector clients medium and long-term fixed rate
loan and a variety of risk management products.
</P>
<P>
In fact, a favorable investment climate has already given Egypt
more recognition, said Lindbaek, citing an investment grade
granted to Egyptian paper this year by a leading rating agency and
the inclusion of Egypt in IFC's Investable Stock Market Indices.
</P>
<P>
"IFC's decision is an acknowledgment of tremendous changes in
the Egyptian economy," said Lindbaek, adding that the indices
bring information about the promising Egyptian market to a wide
group of investors and will help encourage more foreign investment
in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
Participation of the private sector represented 60 percent of
the volume of economic activities in Egypt by 1995, a 50 percent
rise over the 1970s.

<HEADLINE> Hariri Vows to Continue Reconstruction Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri
reaffirmed here today his government's determination to continue
reconstruction despite current stalemate in the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the Third Conference of the
Arab Capital Markets in Beirut, Hariri said "we should continue our
programs of development and continue to attract foreign capital and
investments and open the country to the world markets."
</P>
<P>
Talking about possible effects of the deadlock in the
Middle East peace process on investments in Lebanon and Arab
countries, the prime minister stressed that Lebanon believes in
peace but has never bet on peace.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon believes in peace," he said, "we are the people
which have suffered much from the war and from outcomes of the war
in various fields of our life."
</P>
<P>
"But we have never bet on peace because betting on peace
means one puts his political and national decision in the hands of
another party which could agree to peace or could not do that,"
the billionaire-turned prime minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, who is considered by many Lebanese as the architect of
the country's ambitious post-civil war reconstruction and
development, said that his government will continue its schemes of
reconstructing the country and rebuild its infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
"We have not put our national and political decision in the
hands of Israel to let it move them as it wants," the Lebanese
leader underlined.
</P>
<P>
Trying to minimizing the negative impacts resulting from a
possible collapse of the peace process, the prime minister said
that there is not such a big difference between an attainment of
peace and a failure to achieve it as imagined by some people.
</P>
<P>
"There will be various challenges and problems before us if
peace is realized, just as we are facing the current challenges
and problems because peace has not be obtained due to Israel's
intransigence," Hariri added.

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Principles for Humanitarian Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 21 (xinhua) -- Compliance with the purposes
and principles of the UN Charter, particularly respect for state
sovereignty and for the views of the states and parties concerned,
and strict neutrality remain important principles for
international aid to refugees and displaced persons, Chinese
Ambassador Wang Xuexian said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the UN Security Council on the protection of
humanitarian assistance to refugees and others in conflict
situations, he said that the solution and the provision of
humanitarian assistance to refugees are the common responsibility
of the international community as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the United Nations is concerned, humanitarian
activities should mainly be taken by the relevant departments and
agencies, while the Security Council should mainly involve itself
with the settlement of political and security-related issues," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The political will and willingness to cooperate on the part of
the states and parties concerned are the key to the success of
conflict resolution and humanitarian assistance, he said.
</P>
<P>
The international community should make greater efforts to
promote peace, he said, adding that resolution of conflicts by
such peaceful means as good offices, mediation and negotiations is
in itself an effective way to protect refugees.
</P>
<P>
On the tendency toward frequently invoking Chapter 7 of the UN
Charter or even authorizing the use of force in peace-keeping and
humanitarian relief, he said, the approach will more often than
not further complicate problems.
</P>
<P>
"When the use of force is indeed necessary for the protection
of the delivery of humanitarian relief and the safety and freedom
of movement of UN peace-keepers, the authorization to use force
must be strictly confined to self-defense," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed "preventive development" but said "preventive
deployment" is being much talked about. The international
community should make great efforts to eradicate the root causes
of refugees by encouraging national unity, promoting economic
development and maintaining national stability, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Plan to Pay Off UN Dues Stalls in Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government's
proposal to pay 1 billion U.S. dollars in dues owed to the United
Nations has run aground in the Republican-controlled Congress, the
New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The conservative Republicans have been insisting that the
United States would not pay some of the debt if the world body
failed to enact changes required by them.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has held a series of negotiations
with the Republicans in the House and Senate to try to work out an
agreement on the U.N. reforms and due payment.
</P>
<P>
Proposals circulating in the U.S. Congress require everything
from permanently reducing U.S. annual dues to slashing the expense
accounts of the ranking officials, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposals, which have the backing of the Republican
leadership in both houses, the United Nations would also have to
reimburse the cost of American military equipment and support for
U.N. peacekeeping operations, to impose still more budget
restraints and even to allow the General Accounting Office of the
U.S. Congress to check the U.N.'s book.
</P>
<P>
But the administration, in quiet negotiations with the U.S.
Congress, has opposed many of the proposals.
</P>
<P>
The wrangling between the administration and the Republicans
comes only months after new U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
visited Washington in January. During the visit, the U.N. chief
promised to make necessary reforms while both the administration
and Congress pledged that the United States would finally pay off
the owed dues.

Investment Project, Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Planning Rima Khalaf Tuesday signed the

</P>
<P>
This soft loan, which is provided by Japan's Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund, bears an interest rate of 2.7 percent. The

Japan has been the second largest aid contributor to Jordan
after the United States since the 1990 Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has
submitted the cabinet a report covering international bids to
establish a new oil refinery in Jordan's Red Sea port city Aqaba,

</P>
<P>
Amman -- Jordan now suffers large trade deficit, which is

<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and Ukraine are pondering on the establishment

on raising the idea of the joint bank and the centers for
discussion during the upcoming session of the Egyptian-Ukrainian

<HEADLINE> War Lingers in Newly-Born Democratic Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Guo Ming)
</P>
<P>
KINSHASA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Intensive fighting continued
today in Zaire's western Lower Zaire Province between troops of
Laurent Kabila, Head of State of the newly-born Democratic
Republic of Congo, and soldiers loyal to exiled former President
Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
"Kabila's advancing troops met fierce resistence from the
Mobutu loyalists in Matadi," said a military observer, referring
to the country's only seaport 400 km west of Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as Kabila arrived at Kinshasa, his people's
liberation army blocked the no. 1 high way, the only road on
Lower Zaire's narrow strip of land connecting the country's vast
land to the Atlantic ocean, military sources said, adding the
move was aimed at ensuring security of the capital.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way we could sit back and relax because the
country is still at war," said a military spokesman of Kabila,
who is also chairman of the ruling Alliance of Democratic Forces
for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL).
</P>
<P>
"And the newly-born Democratic of Congo is facing many other
difficulties," he added.
</P>
<P>
Foreign diplomats here said Kabila's top priority is to seek
an immediate end to the armed conflicts still lingering in the
country after he toppled the Mobutu administration and announcing
himself to be Head of State of the Democratic Republic of Congo
on May 17.
</P>
<P>
"How to liberate the contry's last zone still controlled by
Mobutu loyalists, is above all the concerns of President Kabila,"
said one of his aides.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, after presiding over an urgent military meeting of the
ADFL in Kinshasa today, ordered reinforcement to the Matadi
fronts.
</P>
<P>
The narrow strip of land is very important to the newly-born
Democratic Republic of Congo, where Matadi seaport, a major sea
passage is located.
</P>
<P>
So far Kabila has not yet made any formal announcement on the
formation of his new government. Kabila may swear in his new
government anytime from now, which will "mark a new chapter in
the history of Congo (Zaire)," said one of Kabila's aides.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today called on the country's fashion industry to stop glamorizing
heroin use.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering of U.S. mayors, Clinton said that some
industry leaders have already admitted the so-called practice of
heroin chic.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "They're admitting flat-out that images projected
in fashion photos in the last few years has made heroin addiction
seem glamorous and sexy and cool."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "You do not need to glamorize addiction to sell
clothes.... The glorification of heroin is not creative, it's
destructive."
</P>
<P>
He said that heroin is increasingly becoming the drug of choice
on college campuses and elsewhere, in part because of the pictures
that young people see.
</P>
<P>
But he also said new statistics showing a drop in the use of
methamphetamine in key Western cities, eight of 10 which he said
showed drops of between 7 percent and 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and his top anti-drug lieutenants met with about 80
members of the U.S. Conference of Mayors at the White House for a
national forum on drugs.
</P>
<P>
The president said drug use remains "a problem of every
American citizen," and he called on everyone to stick to tough,
intolerant attitudes against drugs even if "there might be a
little money to be made out of it."

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the
French Development Bank (CFD), Antoine Peuillieute, said today

<HEADLINE> Egypt Renews Call for Stopping Settlement Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today renewed its call for
stopping the Jewish settlement construction on Arab land, an issue
that has taken the center stage in the two-month-old Mideast peace
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak made the appeal during talks
with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat who arrived here today as
the deadlocked peace process shows no sign of a breakthrough,
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said that Arafat expounded to Mubarak the latest
developments in the occupied lands and his view of the way to
circumvent the crisis. The discussions might continue tonight and
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the Palestinians stand firm in their demand for
halting Israeli settlement in order to restart the talks which
came to a standstill after Israel started construction of a new
neighborhood in Arab East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Israel refused to budge on its settlement building in Jerusalem
which it wants to have as future capital while the Palestinians
insisted on stopping the project before resuming the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Mubarak's proposal to halt the project for six
months, Moussa said what the president meant is that settlements
should be stopped completely in order to "pave the way for
restarting serious and significant negotiations."
</P>
<P>
"Bulldozers' work can never create an appropriate atmosphere
for serious and successful negotiations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The top Egyptian diplomat also played down the significance of
an American report saying that one quarter of the existing Jewish
settlement is empty.
</P>
<P>
"The American stance against Israeli settlement policy is
known. But there should be a way to revive the peace process
which can not be maintained with the continuation of settlements
especially in Jerusalem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia as a co-sponsors of the peace process should take part
in the pooled efforts to salvage peace, he said, however, the
U.S. role is still important.
</P>
<P>
Contacts are still going on with the U.S. besides the Europeans
whose role "is welcomed," he said, adding that Mubarak has urged a
"projected European role" in the peace process during his recent
visit to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been deeply involved in the Mideast peace process
since it signed a peace deal with Israel in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Secret crisis talks overnight Tuesday between Israel and the
Palestinians failed to ease a two-month-old deadlock.
</P>
<P>
After U.S. Mideast coordinator Dennis Ross left the region
empty-handed last weekend, Arafat blamed the lack of American
pressure on Israel for a breakdown of the "core bargain" of the
1993 Israeli-PLO Oslo deal.
</P>
<P>
Disappointed with Ross' performance during the nine-day
mission, he has asked U.S. President Bill Clinton to personally
get involved in efforts to break the impasse.

<HEADLINE> US Genomics Company Discovers Asthma Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 21 (Xinhua) -- An American genomics company
announced today that it has discovered a gene responsible for
asthma.
</P>
<P>
Sequana Therapeutics, Inc., based in La Jolla, southern
California, said that the discovery will provide new clues into
improved diagnosis and treatment of asthma, the leading cause of
hospitalization and absenteeism in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Asthma affects approximately 100 million people worldwide and
costs the United States more than 6 billion dollars in diagnosis,
treatment and lost wages. About 15 million people, including
nearly 5 million children, suffer from asthma in the U.S., and
prevalence of the disease has doubled over the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Rate of asthma emergency room visits and death in urban areas
are several times the national average, according to Sequana
experts. There is no known cure fo this epidemic, and current
treatments are limited to reducing inflammation or controlling
airway construction.
</P>
<P>
"Sequana's gene discovery is perhaps this country's most
important finding in the etiology of asthma," said Richard D.
O'Connor, clinical professor of pediatrics at the University of
California, San Diego, School of Medicine. "This landmark
discovery will bring us one step closer to finding better drugs to
address this growing epidemic."
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1993 and staffed with 200 researchers, Sequana is a
leading genomics company that uses industrial scale gene finding
technologies and functional genomics to develop products aimed at
diagnosing and treating common human diseases. Its gene discovery
programs cover asthma, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis,
schizophrenia and manic depression.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Advises Zaire's New Leader to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Y. Museveni
today advised Zaire's new leader Laurent Kabila to maintain
unity and form a broad-based national government in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held here this evening,
Museveni noted that there are many groups against former Zairean
leader Mobutu Sese Seko which are not necessarily working with
Kabila. Therefore, he said, the first step for Kabila to take is
to maintain unity by involving all the political groups in a
bid to form a broad-based government.
</P>
<P>
But Kabila cannot lose his control and his own supporters must
have majority within that government, so that they can do things
through their programs, Museveni said.
</P>
<P>
The second step is to open up infrastructure including roads
and rivers, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
Macro economic stabilization is the third step, because
inflation in Zaire is very high, he added.
</P>
<P>
On situation in northern Uganda, Museveni said that peace is
prevailing in the part of the country, though there are now small
groups of rebels making insurgency.
</P>
<P>
"We are now getting them one by one. They are surrendering to
us by a very big number, so the situation in the that part of the
country is tremendously good," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Lord's Resistance Army which has its bases in
southern Sudan has since 1987 been acting in northern Uganda,
disstabilizing the country.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG to Recover Arms After Liberia's Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping force
in Liberia, known as ECOMOG, said today it will extend its
current operation to recover hidden arms in that country even
after the elections later this year.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's legislative and presidential elections, originally
scheduled for May 30, have been shifted to July.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the sub-region were at a meeting today in Abuja,
capital of Nigeria, to decide a new date. But the outcome of the
meeting is yet to be known.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement by press secretary to ECOMOG
Commander Victor Malu, the force is determined to considerably
reduce the level of illegal arms before its departure.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG succeeded in disarming Liberia's former factional
fighters and demobilizing the factions four months ago. A lot of
arms hidden by the various factions have since been discovered.
</P>
<P>
The campaign to recover hidden weapons is designed to rid
Liberia of illegal arms and improve the security situation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to Malu, ECOMOG is willing to contribute to the
transparency of the rescheduled elections so as to create the
public support needed to deal with those who might want to resist
the result of the elections.

<P>
NICOSIA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The 22nd Cyprus International
State Fair opened here this evening with emphasis on promoting the
island further as a transit center for economic activities.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at the opening of the fair, Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides said, "the government's ambition is to promote
Cyprus even further as a transit center and base for carrying out
other economic activities," as the island is located at the
crossroads of three continents.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Cyprus' excellent relations with the
Middle East, the Balkans and Eastern Europe, its European course
and its excellent infrastructure in human and material resources
are assets that make it a singular base for economic and
business activities.
</P>
<P>
The President also noted that Cyprus' accession to the
European Union will create significant advantages for the
economies of its friendly neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the opening ceremony, Minister of Commerce,
Industry and Tourism, Kyriakos Christofi said the fair "reflects
and projects not only the achievements of manufacture and the
economic activity and development of the island in general, but
in particular the Cypriot businessman's industrial and commercial
dynamism".
</P>
<P>
He noted that in 1996 total imports reached 1.86 billion Cyprus
pounds (3.92 billion dollars), showing an 11.2 percent increase
compared with 1995, whereas total exports were about 650 million
Cyprus pounds (1300 million dollars), an increase of 16.8
percent, Christofi explained.
</P>
<P>
The Minister also said that re-exports showed a rapid
increase, reaching 420 million Cyprus pounds (840 million
dollars), but exports of local products remained at 1996 levels.

</P>
<P>
KINSHASA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The French government today
demanded that the authorities of the newly-born Democratic Republic
of Congo to probe the killing of two French nationals in
Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
The message was delivered by French ambassador to Zaire,
Jacques Rummelhardt, who made contact this afternoon with the
authorities of Democratic Congo in capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Two French businessmen were killed on Tuesday night by
armed looters believed to be members of the exiled Zairean
president Mobutu Sese Seko's army, which had already been
defeated by Kabila's People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
These scattered soldiers of Mobutu's army fled with their arms
as Kabila's troops "liberated" Kinshasa on May 17 to finally
topple the Mobutu regime. Kinshasa is the last major city
captured by Kabila's soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French ambassador also handed over an official
four-point message to Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for
the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), which currently serves as
the ruling authorities of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Although content of the message was not made public,
observers said France, the major western power to support the
falling regime of Mobutu, might just as well modify its stance and
slowly move into the process of recognizing Kabila's Democratic
Republic of Congo.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Swazi government has
denied claims that it intended to close down the kingdom's only
independent newspaper, "The Times of Swaziland".
</P>
<P>
The denial came in the wake of calls from a number of senate
members last week for the government to close the publication
after it published an article claiming King Mswati III had failed
to pay rates on a property he owned, according to South African press
reports.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has apparently ordered most government
departments and parastatals not to advertise in the newspaper, of
which about half of the newspaper's advertising revenue came from
such advertising.
</P>
<P>
The paper's news editor, Vusi Ginindza, confirmed the verbal
order on Monday and said the publication had already had
cancellations from some departments.
</P>
<P>
Ginindza said the order to government departments and
parastatals was apparently in retaliation for the article.
</P>
<P>
The Times of Swaziland has a daily circulation of about 11,000
at present.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President: Greek Cypriot Side Ready for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Cypriot side will accept
an invitation to hold direct talks with the Turkish Cypriot side
even though the latter has given no evidence of a shift from its
intransigent position, Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides said
here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the opening of the 22nd International
State Fair, which was attended by about 2,000 local and foreign
exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
"We have indicated to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan that
the Turkish side has given no sign of any intention to shift
from its well-known positions on the basic aspects of the
Cyprus problem and that he would, therefore, have to consider
seriously the consequences of a new failure," the President
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "our side will not refuse to attend" direct
talks, if Annan decides to call the talks. "We shall attend, once
more, with goodwill as we are keen to reach a settlement the
soonest possible," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the content of the talks, Clerides said that "we
shall insist that the talks should concentrate on discussion of
the basic aspects of the Cyprus problem" -- matters relating to
sovereignty, security, territorial adjustments, the constitution
and guarantees of a future federal state of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been conducting proximity talks with the Greek
and Turkish sides in Cyprus since March, aimed at preparing
the ground for direct negotiations between Clerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Chief Annan said earlier this week that he hopes to
have the leaders of the two communities in Cyprus for
face-to-face discussion in New York next month.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> US PC Computer Quarterly Profit up 141 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Dell Computer Corporation, one
of the fast-growing personal computer companies in the United
States, reported Tuesday fiscal first quarter earnings that
exceeded the previous estimates, as its sales growth outpaced that
of other personal computer makers in the country.
</P>
<P>
For the quarter, which ended on May 4, Dell reported earnings
of 198 million U.S. dollars, more than twice the 82 million U.S.
dollars it reported in the comparable period a year earlier. Sales
grew 58 percent, to 2.59 billion U.S. dollars from 1.64 billion
U.S. dollars a year earlier, according to a report of the New York
Times today.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Dell had benefited from excellent execution
of its direct-sale strategy, which allows it to undercut some of
competitors by avoiding dealer markups.
</P>
<P>
Michael Dell, Dell's chairman and chief executive said that his
company' goal is to take the Dell direct model to the next level,
and the Internet and value-added services represent excellent
opportunities to achieve that goal.
</P>
<P>
The Compaq Computer Corporation, the largest personal computer
maker in the country, is working to understand and emulate Dell
model in an effort to enter the direct sales business, the report
revealed.

<HEADLINE> 8,000 Hectares of Forests Razed in North-eastern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Rammpant fire incidences in
Tanga region, north-eastern Tanzania this year razed about 8,675
hectares of natural forests, mainly forest reserves.
</P>
<P>
Felician Kilahama, farm forestry advisor with the Tanga-based
East Usambara Catchment Forest Project, made the statements in an
interview with the Tanzania News Agency (SHIHATA) here today.
</P>
<P>
"With a crude value of 10,000 Tanzania Shillings, about 16.6
US Dollars, per hectare, it means some 86.75 million T.Shs, about
144,580 Dollars, in value," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the causes of the fire, Kilahama said whether wet
or dry, fire does not happen naturally in forests or
miraculously. He noted that it was directly started by people in
one way or another.
</P>
<P>
Tanga, like the rest regions of Tanzania, faced an
extra-ordinary dry period this year compared to previous years.
</P>
<P>
The expert emphasized the need for villagers and local
governments to make efforts to prevent and control outbreaks of
fire in forest areas.

ABU DHABI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Syrian vice President Abdul
Halim Khaddam today arrived in Bahrain on an official visit to
seek support for Syria's drive to establish a strong Arab front
against Israel and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain is the fifth and the last leg for his Gulf tour
which has taken him to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United
Arab Emirates and Oman.
</P>
<P>
During the visits, he discussed with senior officials of
the Gulf states the peace process in the Middle East and
Turkey's military cooperation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources here said that Syria was seriously concerned
by Turkey's recent incursion into northern Iraq and its military
pact signed with Israel.
</P>
<P>
They said Damascus is trying to build a united Arab front to
face the challenges, not only imposing pressure on Israel, but also
thwarting Turkey's threat to the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Israel's peace negotiations with Syria were suspended in
February 1996 while talks with the Palestinians have been in
crisis since Israel began in March to build thousands of houses
for Jews in Arab East Jerusalem where the Palestinians want to
build their capital of a future state.

<HEADLINE> Most Caribbean Economies Post Growth in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TORONTO, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Most of the 17 borrowing member
economies of the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) registered
economic growth, CDB President Neville Nicholls said here today.
</P>
<P>
A few of these economies posted "significant growth", the
president noted while presenting the bank's annual report to its
27th annual Board of Governors meeting, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
"Guyana sustained the process of economic recovery of the past
few years with a growth rate of almost eight percent in 1996,"
Nicholls said.
</P>
<P>
The Cayman Islands continued to be vibrant with five percent
growth, and Barbados recorded "a very encouraging" growth of 4.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Most of the other economies experienced growth ranging from
slightly above three percent to just under one percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the economies of Auguilla and Montserrat did not
fared quite as well, mainly because of the "highly damaging
effects of an erupting volcano."
</P>
<P>
Overall, the economic performance in the region depended
heavily on factors in the international economy where growth in
1996 dipped below the levels achieved during the previous two
years, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, the performance of the tourism sector, which has a
pervasive influence on most Caribbean economies, was dampened
mainly by competition from high public-interest activities in the
United States of America and fear of dangerous weather systems in
the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
In other major sectors, the Caribbean region continued to face
the difficulties of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The banana industry battled harsh weather, low fruit quality
and uncertain market prospects in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"And whereas the production of raw sugar expanded, considerable
threat to its trading preferences exist within the new
dispensations of the World Trade Organization," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, economic and institutional adjustment in the region
continued to be "a critical area for policy action" so as to gain
"competitiveness within the framework of market liberalization,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
To help its borrowing member economies, the bank provided the
region with a total of 104.8 million U.S. dollars of new loans in
1996.
</P>
<P>
CDB is a subregional financial institution designed to foster
economic growth and development in the region while promoting
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It is currently composed of 17 regional borrowing members,
three regional non-borrowing members and five non-regional
members.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1969, the bank has been headquartered in Bridgetown,
Barbados.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sees High Maternal Mortality Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria accounts for 15 percent of
the annual global maternal mortality, with 800 out of 100,000
mothers died annually during child birth, an expert said today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, one in every 13 Nigerian women died from pregnancy
complications, in contrast to one in 69 in southeast Asia and one
in 3,200 in western Europe.
</P>
<P>
Major factors of the deaths include maemorrhage, obstructed
labor and unsafe abortion, said Adenike Grange, a World Health
Organization (WHO) adviser in maternal and child
health/reproductive health.
</P>
<P>
About 20 percent of the conditions were aggravated by
pre-existing anaemia and malaria, she added.
</P>
<P>
The WHO expert said that maternal mortality occurred more
among teenage mothers, whose conditions arose mainly from
physiological immaturity and behavioral factors.
</P>
<P>
Between 38 and 68 percent teenage mothers sought care for
post-abortion complications, she said, adding that their children
were at higher risks of dying than those born to older mothers.
</P>
<P>
According to the expert, one in every five Nigerian children
between the ages of two and five were at the risk of dying from
low birth weight, hypothermia and birth asphyxia.
</P>
<P>
"These are reflections of poor maternal care and preventable
diseases like malaria, diarroea and measles," she said, quoted by
the News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
She also said that adolescent mothers were more vulnerable to
sexually-transmitted diseases such as AIDS.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO expert, Nigeria needs reproductive health
programs that will make information available to all member of
the family and "enable women to go safely through pregnancy and
provide couples with the best chance of having healthy infants".

Minister Ihechukwu Madubuike.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
At a workshop on Integratd Management of Childhood Illness on
Tuesday in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, the minister said that 191
per 1,100 children under the age of five die from comon preventable
childhood diseases such as malaria, measles, diarrhoea, malnutrition
and acute respiratory infection.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the government has decided to use the integrated
approach which, he said, "would allow health workers to see a patient
in totality in view of observed overlaps in clinical presentations of
some of the childhood diseases."

<HEADLINE> UK Central Bank's Supervisory Role Curbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Eddie George, Governor of Bank of
England, said today that he was surprised at the timing of the
announcement by Chancellor Gordon Brown that the Bank's
supervisory role is to be taken away.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, George said that while he
had no difficulty with the direction in which supervision is
moving, "implementation is going to be difficult".
</P>
<P>
Britain is not the first country to move responsibility for
banking supervision away from its central bank. The general trend
now in the world appears to be towards a separation between
central banks and financial supervision.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Brown said at a dinner party last night that the
current regulatory structure was "inefficient, confusing for
investors and lacks accountability and a clear allocation of
responsibilities".
</P>
<P>
The powers of the Securities and Investments Board will be
strengthened to bring together regulation of banking, securities
and insurance.
</P>
<P>
"This will improve the competitiveness of the sector and create
a regulatory regime to meet the challenges of the 21st century,"
the Chancellor added.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he is going to resign after his bank was stripped
of the power of supervision, the Governor said he did not
"seriously consider resigning" as a result.
</P>
<P>
George said it is "enormously important" that the newly
strengthened Securities and Investments Board does not
over-regulate.
</P>
<P>
However, the Governor said that given the fact that the world
may reach a stage where it is difficult to distinguish a bank from
another financial institution, it makes "entirely good sense to
move to a world that we are not in now".

<HEADLINE> Kabila Postpones Formation of New Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

(by Guo Ming)
</P>
<P>
KINSHASA, May 21 (Xinhua) --Laurent Kabila, Head of State of
the new-born Democratic Republic of Congo has postponed to
declare his new government of national salvation, originally
scheduled for today.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who arrived at capital Kinshasa last night from his
military headquarters in the southern city of Lubumbasi, has not
made any public appearance today.
</P>
<P>
He has spent the whole day in the residence of former Prime
Minister General Likulia Bolongo in the suburbs of Kinshasa,
meeting with his new cabinet members, some of whom are already
known to the public, and with various political leaders.
</P>
<P>
He also presided over an urgent military meeting to discuss
the continued warfare in the western Lower Zaire Province between
Kabila's troops and soldiers loyal to exiled former president
Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
Foreign journalists and diplomats waited for a whole day today
for an announcement of the formation of the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Repeatedly asked when the new government will be formed, one
of Kabila's aides said: "Any time from now."
</P>
<P>
Kabila and his soldiers waged a seven-month war to finally
topple the Mobutu administration on May 17 when troops of his
Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire
(ADFL) "liberated" Kinshasa, thus controlling 90 percent of the
Africa's third largest country.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, he declared himself to be the head of state
and changed the country name from Zaire to the Democratic
Republic of Congo.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Unbreakable Bond of Love </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- For 58-year-old Awahan, a typical
day is spent in doing chores both in the field and the
house. Unlike most peasant women in her village in the northwest
region of Xinjiang, she has a special job, namely, to dress and
feed her 29-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
Daughter Abigul, possessing a height of only one meter and the
intelligence equal to a four year old, has been confined in a
wheelchair all her life due to a damaged spine.
</P>
<P>
"The girl has really been pampered,"Awahan complains
lovingly. "She only eats fine rice and flour, and insists on
having her clothes changed every three days."
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Abigul has been the center of Awahan's love as well as
that of her family ever since the day she adopted the abandoned
child 29 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Longing to have a child, a young Uygur couple living in the
outskirts of Fukang, about 60 kilometers east of the regional
capital of Urumqi, adopted a five-month-old Han baby girl in 1968.
</P>
<P>
"We named the baby Abigul, meaning golden flower, hoping she
will grow to be as beautiful as a golden flower," Awahan recalled.
</P>
<P>
However, the couple soon began to worry about the baby's
inability to sit up, then to stand up and talk. One doctor said
the baby had calcium deficiency, so Awahan fed her calcium tablets
and calcium-rich foods, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
Years passed with Awahan carrying the child to every doctor she
could think of, and Abigul was finally diagnosed in a Urumqi
hospital as a victim of a spine fracture at birth. Then, Abigul
was 15 years old, and Awahan knew her only child would never stand
up.
</P>
<P>
"I was not exactly devastated by the news, as you might think,"
Awahan said. "Perhaps I was too tired to be, or perhaps I had sort
of suspected it for a long time."
</P>
<P>
She had tried her best over the years -- selling every object
of value in her house for the money to pay medical treatment for
Abigul, and borrowing money from every possible source.
</P>
<P>
"During the worst time, there was only a table left in the
house," she recounted.

<HEADLINE> Bildt Urges Bosnians to Adopt Economic Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior international official
today warned the Bosnian parties of the possibility of reducing
financial assistance if they do not adopt required economic laws
before a ministerial meeting on Bosnia later this month.
</P>
<P>
Carl Bildt, High Representative in charge of the Dayton peace
accords implementation, said in a statement that the Bosnian
council of ministers and presidency should agree on the package of
legislation before the conference on May 30, in Sintra, Portugal,
of foreign ministers of the Steering Board of the Peace
Implementation Council.
</P>
<P>
"I see no reason why this should not be done in time for
Sintra," Bildt said. "If this does not occur, some members of the
international community might start to reconsider the level of the
assistance they are willing to pledge."
</P>
<P>
Bildt has insisted on passing the economic laws as the
precondition for holding an international donors' conference for
Bosnia and due to the failure for the Bosnian parties to do so,
the conference has been repeatedly postponed.
</P>
<P>
Bildt also said in the statement that the Sintra meeting will
set out the international community's strategy for Bosnia in the
following months and appoint his successor.
</P>
<P>
"A Sintra Declaration will be adopted at the meeting,
expressing the determination of the international community to
press forward with implementation of the Peace Agreement, and
calling on the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina to fully live
up to their responsibilities," Bildt said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Extension of Stand-By Credit to Djibouti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) today approved a request by the government of Djibouti to
extend the current stand-by credit through end-March 1998, and to
augment the credit.
</P>
<P>
The IMF Executive Board okayed a stand-by credit for an amount
equivalent to about 6.4 million U.S. dollars on April 15, 1996.
The newly augmented amount available under the stand-by credit is
by about 2.8 million dollars as an effort to support the
government's economic and financial program for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Djibouti, a tiny country in northeastern Africa, joined the IMF

<HEADLINE> Caspian Sea Countries Meet on Division of Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan,
Turkmenistan and Iran today opened a special meeting on dividing
the natural resources of the Caspian Sea and the its future
status.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Kazakhstan Foreign Minister
Kasymzhomart Tokayev said the central task of the meeting is to
seek a solution to the legal status of the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
The settlement of its status would be conducive to the
exploitation of natural resources in the Caspian, and the
protection of its environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Caspian Sea, which is the largest inland body of water in
the world, abounds in oil and natural gas. Its division is of
strategic importance to the countries around it.
</P>
<P>
So far, there have been four draft treaties on the status of
the Caspian Sea by Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Iran. Russia
and Iran agreed to share the right of exploitation in the center
of the sea, while the other two counties wanted to divide it more
completely.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which ends tomorrow, will also discuss shipping,
fisheries and environmental issues.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Rejects U.S. Attack on Refugee Repatriation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- German Interior Minister Manfred
Kanther today rejected the U.S. criticism on Bonn's plans to
send back Bosnian refugees living in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Bonn needs no advice on how to deal with the issue, Kanther
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, "Civil war refugees are guests for a limited
time and this time is ticking away."
</P>
<P>
He said that of about 30,000 Bosnian refugees who had returned
home from Germany so far, only 191 were actually expelled. "There
are no mass deportations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kanther made the remarks in response to a call from U.S. State
Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, Wednesday asking the German
government to differentiate between Bosnian refugees who wanted to
return home and those who could not return because of repression
from Croatian or Serbian mobs.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian refugees were given political asylum in Germany and
therefore could not apply for work permits and had to be supplied
with public housing.
</P>
<P>
The financial burden to support refugees has led to increasing
public pressure on the German government to begin repatriate some
of them.
</P>
<P>
Germany has taken in about 350,000 Bosnian refugees since war
erupted there in 1992, far more the number accepted by any other
country. Earlier this year, the German government announced that
it would begin sending back refugees since the fighting had
stopped.
</P>
<P>
The United States has accepted 38,000 Bosnian refugees since
1992 and has expressed willingness to take in another 18,000 this
year, including about 5,000 from Germany.

<HEADLINE> China Forecasts More Ocean Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China will have natural ocean
disasters with greater frequency and severity this year, with a
large area of the East China Sea as the center, says the National
Bureau of Oceangraphy.
</P>
<P>
Ye Renmiao, director of the NBO Ocean Monitoring Department,
said that three or four tidal storms caused by typhoons are
expected to hit coastal areas of provinces in southern and eastern
China, such as Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hainan, and
Guangxi, between July and October.
</P>
<P>
The number of days with destructive waves, above four meters
high, will be more than last year's 300 days, and more will be
caused by tropical cyclones. Huge waves are quite likely to affect
parts of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
But, he added, there will be less sea ice in the Bohai Bay and
northern Yellow sea from November 1997 to March 1998 than in
the same period of in the previous corresponding period, he said.
</P>
<P>
There will be an "el nino" phenomenon between November to
December this year, which refers to rapid rises of temperature in
tropical areas of the eastern Pacific, and tends to be followed by
severe floods or droughts the following year in Asia and America,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"NBO has intensified its monitoring efforts by reinforcing its
work staff to put into operation various forecasting methods,
checking its facilities, and strengthening the consultation
system," said Yu Zhouwen, director of the NBO Marine Environmental
Forecasting Center.
</P>
<P>
With rapid economic development of China's coastal areas, the
annual economic losses caused by ocean disasters have also risen
drastically, from about one billion yuan (120 million US dollars)
in early 1980s to some 20 billion yuan (2.4 billion US dollars) in
1996.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Hardline Policy Damages Palestinian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 22 (Xinhua) - Israeli government's hardline policy
has damaged the Palestinian economy in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip since the two sides signed the Oslo peace agreement in
1993, a U.N.-sponsored seminar concluded today.
</P>
<P>
Israel's continuous closure of the Palestinian territories has
led to some 1.2 billion U.S. dollars loss to the Palestinian
economy, this was indicated by U.N. statistics brought to the
three-day seminar entitled "Promoting Palestinian Human Development."
</P>
<P>
The seminar was organized by the U.N. Committee on the Exercise
of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian people (CEIRPP) and
attended by more than 25 countries and several U.N. agencies.
</P>
<P>
"An Israeli siege is imposed around Palestinian territories,"
said Palestinian Economic Minister Mahir Masri at the meeting,
"The Palestinian economy is divided into two parts because of the
closure enforced on the west Bank and Gaza Strip, therefore the
Palestinian market is divided as well," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Palestinian-made goods are not able to move from Gaza to the
West Bank and vice versa. And they also find it difficult to reach
Jordanian, Egyptian, other Arab and European markets. Palestinian
individuals are not able to move freely. Therefore all economic
development elements are missing ... This will lead the the
destruction of the peace process and bring disaster to the
region," said Masri.
</P>
<P>
Statistics here indicate that Israel closed the Palestinian
territories for 91 day in 1993, 71 days in 1994, 125 days in 1995
and 310 days in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Nasir Qadwa, Palestinian representative at the U.N., said that
the goal of Israeli closure is to keep the Palestinian
economy "hostage" in order to continue the Jewish state's
monopolization of the Palestinian markets.
</P>
<P>
The closure policy has given rise to unemployment, decrease of
income, and poverty in the west Bank and Gaza, said the
participants at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment in Gaza is currently estimated at a depressing
50-60 percent, with the highest jobless rate in the refugee
camps, said Jean-Michel Dumont, secretary-general of the
Brussels-based Parliament Association for Euro-Arab Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank, the rate is only 24 percent, but there is a
10-12 percent who are severely under-employed, said the
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Many Palestinians lost their income during the closures which
resulted as well in decreasing demand on Palestinian products in
the West Bank and Gaza, said Dumont.
</P>
<P>
Income per capita has dropped from 1,800 dollars a year in the
West Bank and 1,200 dollars a year in Gaza to 950 dollars and 600
dollars respectively, due to the border closures following the
1993 Oslo peace accord, he added.
</P>
<P>
Diab Alloush, deputy minister of social affairs at the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) said that continuous
closures, absence of political stability in the self-rule areas
and the confiscation of the lands by Israel also lead to poverty
increase among the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Based on 1997 figures which set families whose annual income
fall less than 998.5 dollars as below the poverty line, the deputy
minister estimated the present poverty rate at 20 percent in the
West Bank and at 40 percent in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
If the Israeli poverty standards of 500 dollars per month are
applied, Alloush said, "poverty line in the PNA territories will
jump to 60-70 percent."
</P>
<P>
Despite economic hardships, the PNA is still trying to
eradicate poverty through employing more than 35,000 people during
the closure time and giving annual pension to more than 30,000
families at a monthly cost of 700,000 dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
The participants called on the U.N. and the U.S. to pressure
Israel to change its hardline policy and end its closure, in order
to solve Palestinians' current problem.
</P>
<P>
Dumont accused the U.S. of being biased and called for a
balanced mediation to solve the deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Abu Libdeh, President of the Palestinian Central Bureau
of Statistics, called on the U.N. to inject funds into the
Palestinian institutions involved in this process to help them
shed poverty and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, under the mediation of the U.S., Israel and the
Palestinians signed the Oslo agreement to put aside decades of
hostility and build peace together. However, Israel has failed to
live up to its promises. The tightening of the closure of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip and the construction of Jewish
settlements in East Jerusalem have helped worsen the situation and
brought the process to a deadlock.

<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Illegal coal production must be
stopped, vice-premier Wu Bangguo said in a televised conference
today.
</P>
<P>
The coal industry is China's basic industry and both the Party
and the State Council have put great emphasis on its development,
Wu, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee, said.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that great concern must be given to problems existing
in coal industry, especially those in the township-run coal mines
such as illegal mining, poor production conditions, frequent
accidents, backward mining methods, and low usage rates.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide campaign will be conducted within a period of time
to rectify the coal production order, he said, saying that the
emphasis of the rectification will be put on unlicensed
township-level coal mines.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Tightens Control over Special Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China has tightened control over
both the production and sale of a number of special medicines, in
a bid to prevent them from falling into the hands of drug dealers
or addicts.
</P>
<P>
The State Pharmaceutical Administration recently issued a
circular to its subordinates across the country, requiring them to
strengthen the management of various kinds of special medicines,
such as narcotic and psychiatric medicine and ephedrine.
</P>
<P>
The circular noted that at present, some producers and dealers
of the special medicines lack safety awareness and suffer lax
management, while a number of enterprises have been illegally
producing special medicines without state approval.
</P>
<P>
"Due to these factors, the country's drug dealers and addicts
have targeted the links of production and sales for the special
medicines to acquire drugs or raw materials for drugs," it added.
</P>
<P>
It said that the central government would introduce a new
system to conduct necessary examinations on the purchase of
ephedrine, and anyone wants to buy ephedrine must first apply for
an official certificate.
</P>
<P>
"No cash trade is allowed in the dealing of ephedrine, and
domestic sales of this medicine can only be handled by
state-authorized units," it added.
</P>
<P>
It went on to say that four enterprises in northhwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region producing ephedrine without state
authorization would be shut down, while governments in major
tea-planting provinces should severely crack down on illegal local
activities of producing natural caffeine.
</P>
<P>
"Later on, any producers or dealers of special medicines, whose
products or goods are missing, stolen or flow into any illegal
channels as a result of poor management, will be deprived of the
rights to produce or sell special medicines," it concluded.

<HEADLINE> Syria: Talks with Israel Should be Resumed From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A prominent Syrian figure said
here today that stalemated negotiations with Israel should be
resumed from the point they were suspended in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made by Abdulla Al Ahmar, secretary general of
ruling Arab Socialist Party of Syria, at a meeting here today with
Nayef Hawatmeh, secretary general of the Damascus-based Democratic
Front for the Liberation of the Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Ahmar reiterated Syria's firm stance on the resumption of talks
with Israel, accusing the Netanyahu government of breaching the
peace accord and stalling the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to informed sources here, Ahmar reaffirmed Syria's keen
interest in achieving comprehensive peace in conformity with
international resolutions. Peace should be attained on the basis
of Israeli withdrawal to the border lines before June 4, 1967 and
from Arab Jerusalem, and on the recognition of Palestinian
people's right of self determination, the secretary general said.
</P>
<P>
Hawatmeh said during the meeting that settlements and
negotiations cannot go together. He stressed full Palestinian
solidarity with Syria's stance on the resumption of negotiations
from the point they was suspended.
</P>
<P>
Hawatmeh further said the present predicament of the Mideast
peace process necessitates a new move. This move should be in
clear response to the Arab popular movement and facilitate the
formation of a mechanism for dialogues and the convocation of a
conference bracing all factions, parties and national forces
throughout the Arab world, he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Syria would take the initiative of fulfilling
such a qualitative move, in addition to its efforts to strengthen
Arab solidarity and to call for an Arab summit to tackle the current
developments.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Financial Institutions to Implement Internal Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank has issued a
notice recently urging all commercial financial institutions to
establish an internal control system.
</P>
<P>
Internal control of financial institutions is
self-disciplinary, the People's Bank of China said in the notice.
</P>
<P>
To improve internal control among financial institutions is an
important component of financial supervision and is the keystone
to standardize the activities of financial institutions and to
reduce risks, the notice pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Internal control of financial institutions includes controling
the internal organizational structure, trading risks, trading in
financial derivatives, bank credit and insurance fund risks, the
notice said.
</P>
<P>
Internal control also covers the accounting system, power
authorization, and the computerized business system, the central
bank added.
</P>
<P>
Financial institutions should set up a progressive three-level
monitoring net and introduce a position-linked responsibility
system, the central bank noted.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the financial institutions to establish a
complete information storing system and record all business
activities in a honest, detailed, and timely manner.
</P>
<P>
An effective preventive and warning system should be put into
place to ensure that immediate, proper measures can be taken when
necessary, the notice urged, adding that the proper supervisory
means should be reinforced and improved.
</P>
<P>
The notice said that how internal control is done will be taken
into account when commercial financial institutions are examined
by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will order those financial institutions with
problems in internal control to straighten things out and punish
those with serious problems.
</P>
<P>
When long-term poor internal control or lax implementation of
control measures result in great economic losses or financial
crimes, the central bank will disqualify the senior management
personnel believed to be responsible for the posts they hold for a
period of time or for life, the notice said.

<HEADLINE> Deep Sea Robot to Be Used in Mining (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China's first mission for its
deep sea robot, which can dive 6,000 meters under the sea, will be
sea surveys in north-east Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
"The robot will conduct dozens of sea-bed surveys for
polymetallic nodules in the Pioneer Area, granted by the U.N. in
1991 for deep sea-bed mining, marking a turning point in its
development from the experimentation to the utilization stage,"
said Feng Xisheng, chief designer of the project.
</P>
<P>
"The robot can work under the deep sea for eight hours at a
time, and be controlled cablelessly," he added.
</P>
<P>
The project, one of the key projects of China's hi-tech
development "863" program, began in 1992. Based on technological
co-operation with Russia, the robot passed initial testing
conducted in the Pioneer Area in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"The development of the deep sea robot is a comprehensive
project covering several technological fields," said Guo Shiqin,
chief engineer of the China Ocean Resources Research and
Development Association, which organized two investigation cruises
to the Pioneer area for the polymetallic nodules.
</P>
<P>
Guo said the project involved deep diving, sealing, automatic
control, television, and communications technologies, and the
development of the robot is regarded as challenging as the
development of space technologies.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The General Office of the State
Council, China's cabinet, today issued a circular, urging
governments across the country to attach importance to the summer
agricultural production and the state purchase of grains and oils.
</P>
<P>
The circular said that the planting area for summer grains has
increased this year, and a summer harvest is already in sight as
all grain and oil crops have to date been growing very well.
</P>
<P>
"Success in the promotion of the summer agricultural production
and in the purchase of grains and oils is connected with harvests
for the whole year, as well as the farmers' farming enthusiasm and
sustained and steady agricultural development," it noted.
</P>
<P>
It required that all regions and relevant departments strictly
follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the
State Council, and take effective steps to ensure the summer
harvest and successful purchase of grains and oils.
</P>
<P>
"Governments at all levels across the country must have a clear
understanding of the possible difficulties facing this year's
summer grains and oils purchase, and make full preparations in
various aspects, such as reaping of the crops and storage of
purchased grains," it said.
</P>
<P>
It went on to say that governments at all levels must guarantee
the special fund for the purchase of grains and oils, while all
financial departments and relevant banks should be responsible for
the timely and sufficient supply of money.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely forbidden to give the farmers any IOUs," the
circular stressed.
</P>
<P>
It also reminded various regions and departments of paying
equal attention to the sowing of autumn crops, so as to lay a
solid foundation for the autumn harvest.

<HEADLINE> Financial Institutions Urged to Set up Internal Control System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China, China's
central bank, has urged financial institutions across the country
to fully establish a system of internal control, to ensure a safe
and smooth development for the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the central bank, the internal
control for financial institutions mainly refers to control over
the institutions' internal organizing structure, risks in capital
trade, trading of financial derivatives, risks of loans, risks of
insurance fund, as well as control of the accounting system, of
authorization and accreditation, and of the business computer
system.
</P>
<P>
"The system of internal control is a kind of self-disciplinary
activity of the financial institutions, which can help standardize
their management and prevent risks effectively," said the official.
</P>
<P>
He said that the central bank has also issued a document,
titled "Guiding principles for the strengthening of the internal
control in the financial institutions".
</P>
<P>
The document requires, through the introduction of an internal
control system, that the financial institutions must guarantee
that national laws and regulations and supervisory rules of the
central bank be implemented in full, various risks be limited, and
the institutions' self-development strategies and management goals
be achieved.
</P>
<P>
According to this document, the central bank, besides examining
the financial institutions' business operations, should also take
the responsibility of correcting the internal control situation in
these institutions.
</P>
<P>
"The central bank can suggest a rectification to any financial
institution that has problems with the internal control, and
punish those with serious problems," the document added.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Fires Defense Minister, Chief of Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today dismissed Defense Minister Igor Rodionov and the chief of
the general staff, General Viktor Samsonov, for "doing a bad job"
in reforming the army, Defense Council Secretary Yuri Baturin said.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the surprising decision at today's meeting of the
Defense Council, Yeltsin also appointed Igor Sergeyev,
Commander-in-Chief of the Strategic Missile Forces, as acting
defense minister.
</P>
<P>
The president rebuked Rodionov, who was appointed last July,
for doing nothing to restructure the armed forces and curb rampant
corruption.
</P>
<P>
"I am not simply dissatisfied, I am indignant over the state of
reforms in the army and the general state of the armed forces,"
Yeltsin said while chairing the meeting to discuss military
reforms.
</P>
<P>
He said Rodionov did "a bad job" in military reorganization,
one of Yeltsin's re-election promises last year. Yeltsin, also the
commander-in-chief of the armed forces, had pledged to overhaul
the present conscription system to build a modern, professional
army by 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The soldier is losing weight while the general is getting
fatter," Yeltsin said. "Many of you will not be here if you
proceed like this."
</P>
<P>
Baturin said Rodionov, under scathing fire from
the president, had refused to deliver a scheduled report at the
meeting, saying the speaking time set by Yeltsin was too
short. Samsonov followed suit.
</P>
<P>
He said Yeltsin signed the dismissal order immediately after
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Senior politicians and military generals have been divided over
the reduction of troops, which Yeltsin expects to ease the
pressure of severe money shortages, and salvage the army beset by
poor training and high-level corruption.
</P>
<P>
Some are reluctant to cut the troops, saying the strength of
the Russian army would be eroded by hasty reductions. Rodionov had
insisted the reform began only after the state increased military
spending.
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin said Russia, under economic strains, should start
reforms while cutting military costs.
</P>
<P>
During today's meeting, Yeltsin pointed out that Russia should
reduce defense spending to 3.5 or three percent of Gross Domestic
Product by 2000, down from the present five percent. "Russia cannot
afford such expense," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev, 59, had served as deputy chief of staff and later
deputy commander of the Strategic Missile Forces before taking the
commander's mandate in 1992.

TIANJIN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A Spanish delegation led by Manuel
Fernandez, secretary of state of Trade, Tourism, and Small and
Medium Businesses of the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Spain,
visited the north China city of Tianjin today.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Mayor Zhang Lichang told the visitors that Tianjin, the
largest open coastal city in north China, is opening wider to the
outside world and trying to further improve its investment
environment.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of this year, Zhang said, Tianjin
surpassed Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and other major cities in
China in the introduction of foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
The government and people of Tianjin are willing to bring
cooperation with Spain in all areas to a new level, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said that he brought representatives of some strong
Spanish enterprises in the food, passenger cars, engineering,
trade, and consultancy industries, in the hope that they will be
able to agree upon some projects helpful to Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish Ambassador to China said that Spain puts great
emphasis on cooperation with China and its Tianjin municipality
and will follow closely the Spanish enterprises in China and
provide necessary support to them.
</P>
<P>
Spain is discussing some cooperative projects with Tianjin.

<HEADLINE> Buddha's Birthday Celebrated in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Nepal today celebrated the
2,541th birthday of Lord Buddha, or Sakyamuni, amid an effort to
develop the birthplace of the founder of Buddhism to boost the
country's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand in a message called on
all of the nation to help develop Lumbini of West Nepal into an
international tourist and pilgrimage destination.
</P>
<P>
Chand also appealed to the people to join hands for building
the country under the Buddha's teachings of world peace, religious
harmony and coexistence.
</P>
<P>
Archaeological studies showed that Lord Buddha was born in
today's Lumbini, about 150 km west of Kathmandu, as a royal prince
of the ancient Sakya dynasty which existed 25 centuries ago in the
northern part of the Indian subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
A three-day Lumbini Festival opened today in the western Nepali
town as part of the government's effort to promote the Buddha's
birthplace as a pilgrimage center for Buddhists all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
Various activities including religious talk program, elephant
procession with Buddha statues, afforestation and worship sessions
were being organized during the event.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Buddhist scholars and local officials in Lumbini have
been urging the government to speed up the infrastructure
development in the small town and demanded an international
airport be built there.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Korean Red Cross Talks on Aid to Resume Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL May 22 (Xinhua) -- Inter-Korean Red Cross talks will open
Friday in Beijing for a second round of negotiations on the
South's food aid to the North side.
</P>
<P>
Lee Byung-wung, Secretary-general of the South Korean Red
Cross, left for Beijing today to attend the talks with his
counterpart, Paek Yongho, of the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The meeting will discuss the scale, timing, type and procedures
for food aid delivery. The South is ready to announce grain
assistance of 50,000 tons by the end of July, say Red Cross
officials here.
</P>
<P>
The first round of talks was held earlier this month in Beijing
but ended without resolution after the South failed to notify how
and when it would deliver the food aid as demanded by the north.
</P>
<P>
The South earlier suggested Seoul or Pyongyang as the site of
talks but agreed on Tuesday with the North's belief they should be
reopened in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The South would reveal its plan for the grain aid, but would
stick to its former demands to establish land delivery routes,
such as through the truce village of Panmunjom, with its officials
participating in the distribution process.
</P>
<P>
Through the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Cresent Societies (IFRC), the South Korean Red Cross has donated 3.9
million U.S. dollars worth of food and goods to the DPRK since November
1995, says its releases.

<HEADLINE> Kabila's Troops Take Key Matadi Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- President Laurent Kabila of the
Democratic Republic of Congo said his troops today took over the
seaport of Matadi, 400 km to the west of capital Kinshasa,
marking his control of all the territory of Africa's third
largest country.
</P>
<P>
"Matadi has just been liberated today," smiled 56-year-old
Kabila, who announced himself preisdent as he finally toppled
exiled president Mobutu Sese Seko's regime by his armed capture
of capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Matadi, the last strategic point to be taken over by Kabila's
people's liberation army, is important in that it is the import
and export lifeline of the virtually land-locked country.
</P>
<P>
The port links Democratic Congo's vast hinterland to the
Atlantic Ocean with a narrow, long strip of land.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday his spokesman said "the war is not over and fighting
is still going on," today Kabila marked another military victory
in the strategic port after fierce fighting between his troops
and armed forces loyal to Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
As one of his aides put it, "now we can safely say the
military war is over. But the war on the political and economic
fronts have just begun."
</P>
<P>
He said president Kabila now can focus his attention fully on
the formation of a new cabinet and on planning of the economic
reconstruction of the mineral-rich country.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Continues in Northern Afghan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISALAMBAD, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Fighting is continuing in Baghlan
province of northern Afghanistan between the Islamic militia
Taliban and forces loyal to Uzbek warlord Rashid Dostum, Afghan
sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Taliban forces have taken at least two northern
provincial capitals with the revolt against Dostum spreading from
Kunduz to Baghlan province, said the Afghan sources in Peshawar,
Pakistan's northwestern city.
</P>
<P>
The embattled Dostum is consolidating his positions around his
headquarters Mazar-e-Sharif in Balkh province, they said.
</P>
<P>
There were also reports that Dostum, who is allied with Ahmad
Masood, former military chief of the ousted Afghan government, has
already drawn up an exit route in case Mazar-e-Sharif falls to the
Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The sources said another Dostum's major ally, Jaffar Nadari,
governor of Baghlan province, also shifted to the Taliban's ranks.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, Abdul Malik, right-hand man of Dostum,
defected to the Taliban in the northwestern province of Faryab,
which allowed the militia to have made major gains in northern
Afghanistan after almost six-month stalemate.

<HEADLINE> China Urges the Philippines to Stop Invading Chinese Territory (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government and people
will never accept the administrative rights the Philippines has
brazenly claimed on the Huangyan Island, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Shen Guofang stated at a weekly press conference here
today.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that the Philippine government halt immediately its
invasion of the Chinese territory to show respect to historical
facts, international laws, and China's sovereignty over the
Huangyan Island.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of April this year, the Philippine side has
dispatched warships and warplanes repeatedly to follow, monitor,
and interfere with an international amateur radio venture around
the island and adjacent sea area, which was sponsored by an
non-governmental Chinese organization and participated in by
amateur radio fans from China, the United States, and Japan, Shen
said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, the Philippine side has also sent people
to land on the island several times to erect flagstaffs and
tablets, and unreasonably condemn Chinese personnel on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Shen noted that China has adopted a very restrained attitude
towards the above acts of the Philippines, proceeding from the
overall objective of maintaining Sino-Philippine friendship, and
has asked, through diplomatic channels, the Philippine side to
stop its intrusion of China's territory.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the recent development of the situation has
demonstrated that the Philippine side escalated its invasion of
the Huangyan Island by declaring the administrative rights over
the island claiming the Philippines'' 200-nautical-mile exclusive
economic zone as its excuse.
</P>
<P>
The Huangyan Island has been China's territory since ancient
times, and its legal status has long been defined, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with Article 121 of the UN Convention on the Law
of the Sea, the Huangyan Island is the naturally-formed land area
which is surrounded by water on four sides and rises above the
surface of the sea at the high tide, rather than the shoal or
submerged reef that can not appear above the sea throughout the
year.
</P>
<P>
Many historical documents of China have recorded that China
enjoys sovereignty over the island, Shen said, adding that China
has officially named the island or changed its name three times,
which are the actions of a country exercising its sovereignty over
the island.
</P>
<P>
The international community has also recognized that the island
is China's territory. Many amateur radio fans have landed on the
island for explorations with the approval by the Chinese
government, and many countries are still applying for such
activities now, Shen noted.
</P>
<P>
He continued that as China's territory, the island has been put
on a DXCC call sign list for international amateur radio by a US
union of amateur radio.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine side has never expressed disagreement with
China's sovereignty claim over the island, he said.

<HEADLINE> German Money Supply Growth Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Growth in Germany's inflation
barometer continued to slow down in April, coming down close to
the target corridor set for the year, the central bank said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Frankfurt-based Bundesbank, Germany's M-3
money supply grew by 6.7 percent in April, down from 8.3 percent
in March and 9.1 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
The M-3 money supply, which counts money circulation, sight
deposits, fixed deposits under four years and savings deposits, is
an important barometer for the central bank to measure inflation
and to make decisions on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
For 1997 as a whole, the Bundesbank has set a 3.5 to 6.5
percent corridor for growth in the M-3.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Philippines to Stop Invading Chinese Territory (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently, Shen Guofang said, the Philippine side suddenly
declared maritime administrative rights on the Huangyan Island on
the pretext of its 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ).
</P>
<P>
This stance violates international law and the principles
formulated in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, as its
preface states explicitly that the maritime administrative rights
are not suitable to solving matters related to sovereignty, Shen
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that according to the convention, coastal countries
only enjoy the right to explore and develop natural resources
within the EEZ, and the legal status of other countries'
territories should, by no means, be affected.
</P>
<P>
Shen stated that the issue of the Huangyan Island is that of
its sovereignty, while the development and utilization within the
EEZ belong to the maritime administrative rights.
</P>
<P>
The nature of these two issues, and the legal regulations they
apply, are completely different from each other and cannot be
mixed, he said, adding "the Philippine side is totally untenable
in its attempt to invade China's territory with its maritime
administrative rights.
</P>
<P>
Shen explained that the convention stipulates that under the
circumstance when related countries' EEZs are overlapping, it is
ineffective for a single country to declare the maritime
administrative rights on the 200-nautical mile EEZ.
</P>
<P>
The scope of the EEZs of China and the Philippines should be
mapped out through negotiations in line with principles of the
international law and rules, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government strongly urges the Philippine side to
respect the historical facts, international law, as well as
China's sovereignty over the Huangyan Island, and immediately stop
all its invasion activities on China's territory, in order to
safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea and to
protect the overall state of the China-Philippines friendly
relations," Shen added.

<HEADLINE> Immigration Is Linked to Unemployment: Australian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard today said he agreed with independent MP Pauline Hanson
that immigration and unemployment were linked but denied she had
forced his hand on cutting migrant numbers.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who has been under pressure to renounce
Hanson's views on immigration since her maiden speech last
September, said he had believed the two were linked long before
she arrived on the political scene, the Australian Associated
Press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Hanson today claimed credit for the decision to cut migrant
numbers by 6,000 next year, saying she had forced the government
to take account of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
Howard said that while he agreed with Hanson that high
immigration was linked to high unemployment, she did not influence
his government's decision.
</P>
<P>
"I ... note that the rather empty populist who represents the
seat of Oxley, Mrs. Hanson, is running around going, 'Oh, I did
it,'" the prime minister was quoted as saying by the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) Radio.
</P>
<P>
"Well, can I remind her and the rest of Australia that my
belief that there is a link between certain levels of immigration
and high unemployment goes back to 1991," the prime minister said
on an ABC night news program.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese-Australian, who specializes in Physics at a college
in Canberra, told Xinhua that the prime minister complained in the
late 1980s there were too many Asian immigrants in the country but
later offered apology to Asian voters during the last election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The government Wednesday announced the immigration quota for
1997-1998 would be 68,000, 6,000 less than last year and a drop of
20 percent over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The decision brought cracks in conservative ranks, with
Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett saying the decision to cut the
intake was wrong and not in Australia's best interests.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Amanda Vanstone told University of New
England students that Australia's future growth depends on
immigration.

<HEADLINE> Manila Eyes Private Sector in Infrastructure Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is wooing
the private sector to play a bigger role in the country's
infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national infrastructure forum today, Finance
Secretary Roberto de Ocampo said the private sector participation
was "crucial" due to the colossal amount of infrastructure funds
needed.
</P>
<P>
According to the secretary, the country needs at least 40
billion U.S. dollars for infrastructure construction over the next
10 years, or 7 percent of its gross national product (GNP) every
year.
</P>
<P>
However, the country has the lowest expenses for infrastructure
in Asia at the present time, spending merely two percent of its
GNP while the figure stands at 7 percent in its neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
The private sector involvement is crucial due to limited
resources and as the government is gearing up to improve the
performance of its enterprises through privatization efforts, de
Ocampo said.
</P>
<P>
To lure the private sector to undertake infrastructure
projects, de Ocampo said, the government is establishing an
environment conducive to infrastructure privatization, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government may also provide any form of
direct and indirect support, including cost sharing in which the
government could shoulder part of the expenses of the project.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Seeks to Postpone Repayment of Huge Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 22 (Xinhua) - Jordan is seeking to postpone the
repayment to Western creditors its huge debt, which now accounts
for 90 percent of the gross national product (GNP), to help speed
up its ongoing economic reform.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom, with its official debt reaching 6.5 billion
U.S. dollars, will try to persuade the Paris Club, an non-official
organization devoted to help the developing countries delay paying
debt to Western creditors, to help it reschedule 1.2 billion
dollars of debt that should be repaid between June 1997 and June
2000, a government minister said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting scheduled for May 22, Jordan is optimistic
that it will convince the Paris Club to accept the kingdom's
request, said Deputy Prime Minister for Development Affairs and
Minister of State for Prime Ministry Affairs Jawad Anani, in an
interview with Jordan Times, the country's sole English daily.
</P>
<P>
"The economic steps the kingdom has undertaken recently, such
as reducing the deficit in its annual budget, increasing exports
and the privatization process, will facilitate the approval of
Jordan's request," the deputy prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's economic performance in the past three years will also
assure its major creditors of its ability to repay the money,
Anani said.
</P>
<P>
If the rescheduling is realized, it will help Jordan reduce its
debt repayment burden and cushion the impact of the International
Monetary Fund-directed economic reforms, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's first restructuring of its debt was in 1989 after an
economic crisis which forced the International Monetary Fund to
intervene as the kingdom failed to service eight billion dollars
of foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, with scant natural resources and oil but more than 4
million people, makes limited money from tourism, phosphate
production, export of highly-educated personnel and transit
trade. But it managed to flourish among the Arab states depending
largely on foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan, Germany and Italy are the most
important aid contributors to Jordan. They stopped to provide aid
after the outbreak of the Gulf crisis in 1990, when Jordan sided
with Iraq that invaded neighboring Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
After the crisis, Jordan distanced itself from Iraq and the
contributors then began to give it aid again.

<HEADLINE> Preparatory Committee Holds Ninth Plenum in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The ninth plenary session of the
Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) began today in the Great Hall of the People in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The two-day session will discuss specific methods for forming
the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR, suggestions on
what national laws shall be added to or deleted from Annex 3 of
the Basic Law, and decisions on the swearing-in ceremony of
relevant Hong Kong SAR personnel when taking office.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen delivered a speech at the
meeting, saying the Preparatory Committee has accomplished most of
its tasks.
</P>
<P>
These tasks include forming the Selection Committee for the
First Government of the Hong Kong SAR, electing the candidate of
the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR, and choosing the
Provisional Legislative Council, he said.
</P>
<P>
This fully shows the determination and sincerity of the Central
People's Government in implementing the principles of "one
country, two systems", "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong", and
a high-degree of autonomy in Hong Kong, and has enhanced the
confidence of the Hong Kong people and the international community
about Hong Kong's future, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is also chairman of the Preparatory Committee, said
the Provisional Legislative Council has won increasingly
extensive recognition, despite the non-cooperative attitude of the
British Hong Kong authorities.
</P>
<P>
The specific methods for forming the first Legislative Council
of the Hong Kong SAR that the Preparatory Committee has worked on
in recent months will reflect the principles of democracy,
fairness, and openness, he said.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who accords with the qualifications and requirements
prescribed in the Basic Law and the relevant decision of the
National People's Congress, is eligible to run for the election of
the Legislative Council member, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said how to elect the first Legislative Council should be
taken into consideration not only by the Preparatory Committee,
but also by the executive institution and legislature of the Hong
Kong SAR, adding that they should also be responsible for
organizing the election.

between Britain and China.'"
</P>
<P>
"And we expect that the new British government, in the final
period of the transfer of power of Hong Kong, can effectively
strengthen cooperation with the Chinese side to ensure the stable

</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Cyprus Finance Minister

<P>
Qian also said the Preparatory Committee, when drawing up the
specific methods for forming the first Legislative Council, should
prescribe some general methods on some specific issues, so that
the Hong Kong SAR government could make alternatives on its own
according to the specific situation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Annex 3 of the Basic Law, he said it is natural to
add or delete some national laws in the Annex, according to
Article 18 of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Since the stipulation of the Basic Law in 1990, some national
laws have been formulated, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the laws that the legal panel suggested
adding to Annex 3 are all concerned with national defense, foreign
affairs, and matters that do not relate to the autonomy of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
On the swearing-in ceremony of some personnel in the Hong Kong
SAR, Qian said it must be carried out by some SAR personnel
including the Chief Executive, principal officials, the members of
the Executive Council, the members of the Provisional Legislative
Council, the judge of the Court of Final Appeal and the chief
judge of the High Court.
</P>
<P>
The decision on the issue that is to be made
 at the session will serve as the legal basis when the officials
take office, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian said he was pleased at the progress of the preparation of
the Hong Kong SAR led by Tung Chee-hwa, and expected that the
judges of the Court of Final Appeal will be appointed as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Other preparations for the Chinese government's resumption of
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong are also in smooth
progress, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was presided over by Wang Hanbin, vice-chairman
of the Preparatory Committee.
</P>

Conveners of the panel responsible for drawing up specific
methods for forming the first Legislative Council, legal panel,
and the celebration activities panel delivered work reports to the

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Orders War Against Kidnappers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary Renato
de Villa said today that the government has declared an all-out
war against kidnap-for-ransom syndicates running rampant in the
country.
</P>
<P>
De Villa was referring to a recent directive by President Fidel
Ramos transferring the task of fighting kidnapping syndicates from
the police to the hands of the military.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with ranking military, police and civilian
officials in Cotabato city in Mindanao, De Villa promised that the
government will put more troops, expand operational coverage and
equip the troops with more firepower to fight kidnapping gangs.
</P>
<P>
He also rallied the civilian community for support in weeding
the military and police ranks of misfits and scalawags.
</P>
<P>
"We will also clean it (military and police) from inside while
we move and operate outside," De Villa declared, apparently
referring to reports that men in uniform were involved in crimes,
including kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
Kidnapping syndicates have been operating actively in the
southern Philippines recently, especially in western and central
Mindanao. During the past few months this year, at least 36
persons have been kidnapped in Cotabato city alone in western
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the business community in Cotabato city threatened
to stage a strike after a leading Filipino-Chinese businessman in
the city was killed by his captors.
</P>
<P>
The strike was averted after the government promised to meet
the businessmen's demands to intensify crackdown on kidnappers,
including the transfer of the anti-kidnapping task to the
military.

<P>
JAKARTA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A total of 126 people have been
killed since Indonesia's election campaign started on April 27, an
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Most were killed in traffic accidents, Secretary General of the
General Election Committee Suryana Subrata said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, military sources said that more than 900 violent
incidents had taken place across the country during the campaign
period.
</P>
<P>
All the three contesting parties -- the ruling party Golkar,
the United Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic
Party (PDI) have violated the campaign rules by conducting motor
parades and marches in the street, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The three parties will vie for 425 seats of the 500-member
Parliament with the remaining 75 seats reserved for the armed
forces who do not vote.
</P>
<P>
Friday will be last day of the campaign. The general election
will be held on May 29.
</P>
<P>
This time around, the country is divided into three groups of
campaign areas where the three parties could conduct their
campaigns in turn.
</P>
<P>
However, the supporters of the political parties violated the
campaign rules by showing strength in the streets. They attacked
each other by throwing stones and even setting fire to cars,
houses and other materials.
</P>
<P>
About 124 million voters are eligible to take part in the
general election, the sixth one in the country since 1971.

MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- World tourism leaders concluded
their one-day meeting here today after drafting and adopting a
declaration addressing the negative impacts of tourism.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said during the meeting, tourism leaders from

coordination and monitoring systems among governments, private
sectors and concerned parties.

<P>
They also encourage governments to promulgate legal regimes for
effective regulation of the tourism sector, support wide
participation of communities and recognize the role of human

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Syria Wins Gulf Support Against Turkey, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Syria has successfully won the
support from the Gulf countries for its drive against Turkey and
Israel during recent tours by its senior officials of the oil-rich
region, which ended in Bahrain today.
</P>
<P>
But the tours were marred by Syria's failure in Qatar to
persuade the country to suspend the planned 4th Middle East and
North Africa Economic Summit, which is scheduled to be held in
Qatar this November and will be attended by Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a diplomatic move embracing all of the member states of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Syria's vice President Abdul-Halim
Khaddam started his five-nation Gulf tour last week, which
included Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirate (UAE),
Oman, and Bahrain, while Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara
paid a visit to Qatar, another (GCC) state, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups six members states -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the
UAE, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The tours came following Turkish military incursion into
norther Iraq against its outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) and
its military pact signed with Israel, which has caused Syria's
concerns.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian senior officials' visits were also aimed at
discussing with the Gulf countries the latest developments in the
Middle East peace process, which has come to a halt due to
Israel's hardline policy as regards Jewish settlement expansion in
Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
A Syrian delegate accompanying Khaddam during his Gulf tour
said here Wednesday that Syria is trying to build a strong Arab
front against Turkey and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We need a joint Arab stand against the threats and
challenges besetting the Arab nation. We are discussing (with
the Gulf states) the need for a strong stand in the face of the
hardline Israeli stances and the Turkish-Israeli alliance which
targets all of us," the official stressed.
</P>
<P>
Observers here maintain that Syria has succeeded in its
efforts. All the five countries visited by Khaddam have expressed
their support to Syria's stand in its peace negotiations with
Israel, saying a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East
could never be achieved unless Israel commits itself to relevant
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of the Gulf countries also said during their
meeting with the Syrian vice president that they support Syria's
stand on a resumption of peace talks with Israel from the point
where the two sides stopped.
</P>
<P>
Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations were suspended in February
1996 following a series of suicide bombings in Israel. Israel
demanded that Syria condemn the attacks as "terrorist activities,"
which was rejected by Syria.

After taking office in June, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu demanded the resumption of the talks begin without
precondition while Syria insisted that the talks should be
restarted on the basis of Israel's returning the Golan Heights to
Syria which it captured in 1967 Mideast War.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Syria Wins Gulf Support Against Turkey, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Syria has also obtained the support from the Gulf countries for
its stand on Turkey's incursion into northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The UAE, Oman and Bahrain have urged, in their statements
during Khaddam's visits, Ankara to pull its troops out of the
mountainous areas in northern Iraq, stressing that such military
incursion has harmed Iraq's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia also expressed their concerns over
Turkey's move and insisted that the Iraqi sovereignty be
preserved.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish troops, backed by the air force, have been chasing
rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in northern
Iraq in the past days, which has sparked strong international and
Arab criticisms.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Arab countries, including the GCC states, were also
concerned with Ankara's close military ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Oman, Khaddam said that the
Turkish-Israeli partnership threatens the entire Arab world as
well as peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Despite clear response from the Gulf states on the
Israeli-Turkish military relations, informed sources said
officials of these countries said that they shared the same
concerns with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Shara paid an official visit to Qatari capital Doha Sunday in a
bid to dissuade Qatar from hosting the 4th Middle East and North
Africa Economic Summit in November, because Israel may attend the
gathering.
</P>
<P>
However, Fawaj al Attiyah, Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman,
said after Shara's visit that "We will go ahead with it... ... It
is a purely economic forum and we expect Israel to participate in
it."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, however, said his country has not decided
whether to invite Israel to participate. "We expect Israel's
participation, but as you know, all these things are linked to
developments on the political front," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Israel has attended all of the three previous conferences,
which were separately held in  Casablanca of Morocco in 1994,
Amman of Jordan in 1995 and Cairo of Egypt in 1996.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Kuwait Monday, Khaddam said that such a
forum would violate Arab League's resolutions, which was a clear
criticism of Qatar's stand.
</P>
<P>
Any violation of Arab resolutions or economic cooperation with
Israel will inflict great harm on the Arab countries, the Syrian
vice president warned.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and Oman established economic contacts with Israel in
1995. But plans for expanding the relations have been put on hold
because of the strained Arab-Israeli relations.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain Backs Syria's Position on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Bahraini leaders have told the
visiting Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam that Bahrain
supports the Syrian position on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
This was announced in a press statement made by Khaddam in
Manama today after holding talks with Bahraini leaders, according
to reports monitored here.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam expressed his satisfaction with the outcome of the
talks he had with Bahraini leaders, pointing out that the
views of both sides on the issues considered by them were
concurrent.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian Vice President praised Bahrain's position on the
Middle East peace process, adding that it is in perfect agreement
with those of Syria and the other Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam made it clear that Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad's
message handed by him to Emir of Bahrain Isa Bin Suleiman al
Khalifa dealt with the Middle East peace problems and the
developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
"In the light of Israel's intransigent position on the peace
process, the Arab nation has decided to halt normalization and
all forms of cooperation with Israel," Khaddam said.
</P>
<P>
"Syria collaborates with Arab states for putting resolutions
of the recent Arab summit, as well as those of Arab foreign
ministers and the recent OIC, into practice, because there should
be a unified Arab stand against Israeli intransigence, with the
aim of protecting Arab interests and rights," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bahraini capital Manama is the last leg of his five-gulf-nation
tour which also took him to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab
Emirates and Oman.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the gulf states, Khaddam urged the Gulf
leaders to support the delay of the Doha Mideast-North African
economic summit due to be held next November with the
participation of Israel.
</P>
<P>
local press said today that the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) foreign ministers would consider to postpone the summit to
June next year.

<HEADLINE> China Urges the Philippines to Stop Invading Chinese Territory (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government and people
will never accept the administrative rights the Philippines has
brazenly claimed on the Huangyan Island, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Shen Guofang stated at a weekly press conference here
today.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that the Philippine government halt immediately its
invasion of the Chinese territory to show respect to historical
facts, international laws, and China's sovereignty over the
Huangyan Island.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of April this year, the Philippine side has
dispatched warships and warplanes repeatedly to follow, monitor,
and interfere with an international amateur radio venture around
the island and adjacent sea area, which was sponsored by an
non-governmental Chinese organization and participated in by
amateur radio fans from China, the United States, and Japan, Shen
said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, the Philippine side has also sent people
to land on the island several times to erect flagstaffs and
tablets, and unreasonably condemn Chinese personnel on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Shen noted that China has adopted a very restrained attitude
towards the above acts of the Philippines, proceeding from the
overall objective of maintaining Sino-Philippine friendship, and
has asked, through diplomatic channels, the Philippine side to
stop its intrusion of China's territory.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the recent development of the situation has
demonstrated that the Philippine side escalated its invasion of
the Huangyan Island by declaring the administrative rights over
the island claiming the Philippines'' 200-nautical-mile exclusive
economic zone as its excuse.
</P>
<P>
The Huangyan Island has been China's territory since ancient
times, and its legal status has long been defined, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with Article 121 of the UN Convention on the Law
of the Sea, the Huangyan Island is the naturally-formed land area
which is surrounded by water on four sides and rises above the
surface of the sea at the high tide, rather than the shoal or
submerged reef that can not appear above the sea throughout the
year.
</P>
<P>
Many historical documents of China have recorded that China
enjoys sovereignty over the island, Shen said, adding that China
has officially named the island or changed its name three times,
which are the actions of a country exercising its sovereignty over
the island.
</P>
<P>
The international community has also recognized that the island
is China's territory. Many amateur radio fans have landed on the
island for explorations with the approval by the Chinese
government, and many countries are still applying for such
activities now, Shen noted.
</P>
<P>
He continued that as China's territory, the island has been put
on a DXCC call sign list for international amateur radio by a US
union of amateur radio.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine side has never expressed disagreement with
China's sovereignty claim over the island, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Philippines to Stop Invading Chinese Territory (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently, Shen Guofang said, the Philippine side suddenly
declared maritime administrative rights on the Huangyan Island on
the pretext of its 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ).
</P>
<P>
This stance violates international law and the principles
formulated in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, as its
preface states explicitly that the maritime administrative rights
are not suitable to solving matters related to sovereignty, Shen
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that according to the convention, coastal countries
only enjoy the right to explore and develop natural resources
within the EEZ, and the legal status of other countries'
territories should, by no means, be affected.
</P>
<P>
Shen stated that the issue of the Huangyan Island is that of
its sovereignty, while the development and utilization within the
EEZ belong to the maritime administrative rights.
</P>
<P>
The nature of these two issues, and the legal regulations they
apply, are completely different from each other and cannot be
mixed, he said, adding "the Philippine side is totally untenable
in its attempt to invade China's territory with its maritime
administrative rights.
</P>
<P>
Shen explained that the convention stipulates that under the
circumstance when related countries' EEZs are overlapping, it is
ineffective for a single country to declare the maritime
administrative rights on the 200-nautical mile EEZ.
</P>
<P>
The scope of the EEZs of China and the Philippines should be
mapped out through negotiations in line with principles of the
international law and rules, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government strongly urges the Philippine side to
respect the historical facts, international law, as well as
China's sovereignty over the Huangyan Island, and immediately stop
all its invasion activities on China's territory, in order to
safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea and to
protect the overall state of the China-Philippines friendly
relations," Shen added.

<HEADLINE> EP's Invitation to Taiwan's "Foreign Minister" Denounced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China firmly opposes and expresses
its strong indignation against the European Parliament Foreign
Affairs Committee's invitation to John Chang, Taiwan's so-called
"foreign minister", to conduct any activity in the European
Parliament on May 22.
</P>
<P>
In response to a reporter's question at today's routine press
conference, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang said the
European Parliament's action is open support for the attempt of
the Taiwan authorities to create "two Chinas" and "one China, one
Taiwan", and a serious infringement upon in China's sovereignty
and gross interference in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Shen noted that there is only one China in the world and the
government of the People's Republic of China is the sole
legitimate government representing the whole China with Taiwan as
an inalienable part of it.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing and observing the "one China" principle is the
basis for the establishment of diplomatic ties and development of
relations between China and the European Union (EU), as well as EU
member states, he said.
</P>
<P>
China admonish some people in the European Parliament to
scrupulously abide by principles set for China-EU diplomatic
relations in real earnest and to stop doing anything that will
undermine China's reunification and Sino-EU relations, Shen said.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Israeli Policy Undermines Peace March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
has warned that the Israeli policy seeking to impose a "rightist
Likudist supremacy" will lead to a collapse of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's policy is not
conducive to any kind of peace as it has violated all principles
and international conventions, said Moussa in an interview
published today by the Egyptian Arabic daily newspaper Al Ahram.
</P>
<P>
He renewed the call for abiding by signed agreements and
stopping Israel's settlement building on Arab East Jerusalem, an
issue that has led to the halt of the peace process for two months.
</P>
<P>
Israel refuses to budge on its settlement building in Jerusalem
which it wants to have as future capital while the Palestinians
insist on stopping the project before resuming the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Moussa demanded the U.S. to deal with everything impeding the
peace process "positively and objectively," especially the Israeli
settlement policy in order to realize the balance required for
restarting the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged the Europeans to expand their so far
"limited role" and serve as a counter-balance to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The matter requires interwoven efforts," he said, adding that
the European mediation alone cannot accomplish achievements, but
can unequivocally complement the U.S. efforts.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held talks here Wednesday with
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat as the
deadlocked peace process shows no trace of a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
He proposed a six-month freeze on the construction of
settlements until negotiations open on the future of Jerusalem, an
idea designed to "set a moratorium on the building in order to
pave the way for meaningful negotiations," according to Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which signed a peace deal with Israel in 1979, has been
one of the key mediators in the Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Manila, MILF Make No Progress in Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The fourth round of low-level talks
between the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) ended in Cotabato City, the Southern Philippines,
today without any progress, but negotiators agreed to meet again
on June 17-18.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice-chairman for political affairs, said
the Government-MILF cessation committees failed to arrive at a
consensus on the issues under discussion, especially the
repositioning of respective combatants in Buldon, Maguindanao of
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He said that the failure of the three-day talks was caused by
the government negotiators' back-tracking on their own proposal
for no armed zones and the creation of a joint peace-keeping force
in Buldon.
</P>
<P>
The government negotiators have requested the MILF to have a
more thorough study on their proposal, the rebel leader said.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar said that progress is expected in the scheduled fifth
round of dialogue next month.
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-strong MILF has become the country's major
anti-government group since Manila and the Moro National
Liberation Front signed an accord on peace in Mindanao last
September. The MILF is fighting for an independent Muslim state in
Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Assures Voters of Fair Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today inspected the election headquarters and assured
millions of voters of fair elections tomorrow, saying
"possibility of error in elections virtually nil."
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the 64-year-old
president, who has to step down after serving two four-year terms
in the office, made a one-hour inspection of the election
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that steps taken by the Interior Ministry for
holding the 7th presidential elections have reduced the
possibility of error during the voting and counting to near zero.
</P>
<P>
He called on all executors and observers at the elections to
be extremely precise in conducting the nationwide presidential
elections slated for May 23.
</P>
<P>
This is the second statement by the Iranian president on the
issue of the vote rigging. Last Friday, Rafsanjani openly warned
Interior Ministry officials against any kinds of cheating at
ballot boxes and called for strict impartiality of election
observers.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to dispel the wide concern from the public about the
election fraud, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei Wednesday
made a statement, pledging no vote rigging in the presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that three bodies -- the Interior Ministry, the
Guardians Council and himself -- will watch against any fraud in
the elections.
</P>
<P>
Addressing high-ranking officials and families of prisoners of
war and missing in action during the eight-year war between Iran
and Iraq (1980-1988), he assured the people of the whole country
by saying "I myself will be watchful and will not let any one
commit any fraud in the elections."
</P>
<P>
Conservative Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri and
open-minded former cultural and Islamic guidance minister
Mohammad Khatami are the two main contenders during the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
The two rivals are represented by two major factions -- the
traditional and conservative camp backed by Ali Khamenei and the
moderate and liberal camp supported by Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The victory of either presidential candidate would produce
different kind of political and economic impact upon the
political horizon in Iran, observers here noted.

LONDON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Former Olympic and world 100 meters
champion Linford Christie Thursday was named captain of the
British team for next month's European Cup in Munich, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old Christie will mark his farewell to
international competitions as captain of the British squad. He
will hand over to Olympic 400 meter silver medallist Roger Black
for the World Athletic Championships in Athens in August.
</P>
<P>
His reign as captain began in unusual circumstances at the 1989
European Cup when team officials realised Britain could win the
event and there was no one to accept the trophy.
</P>
<P>
Since then Christie has led the team at every European Cup and
all major competitions including two Olympics Games.

<HEADLINE> Bonn-Tehran Economic Ties Normal After Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran said today that the Berlin
court ruling, which implicated top Iranian leaders behind the
Mykonos case, has not had much adverse effect on economic
relations between Bonn and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati in an interview with the Cable News Network (CNN) this
morning.
</P>
<P>
On future of Tehran-Bonn economic relations, he said, as
far as the European countries are concerned, they do not
intend to alter their policies.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Iran plans to review its priorities in
economic relations with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran's relations with European countries have been brought into
a grave crisis and all ambassadors of 15 EU countries have been
recalled after the verdict of the Mykonos case by the Berlin court
on April 10.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the leading trade partner of Iran after the United
States broke off its diplomatic and economic ties with Tehran 18
year ago. The total annual trade volume of the two countries once
topped 4 billion U.S. dollars in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The EU countries take a lionshare of Iran's total import and
export. Their exports to Iran made up 41.3 percent of the total
import of Iran while their import from Iran made up 32.8 percent
of the total export of Iran in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The EU countries have occupied a majority of the Iranian
market, which imports about 15-18 billion dollars worth of
products from various of countries.
</P>
<P>
Velayati stipulated that what happened in Germany was a
disaster for the German judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Terming as strange and contrary to all judicial and
international principles the implication of Iran by the prosecutor
of Berlin Court, he said, no one has the right to judge about
high-ranking officials of other countries and come up with a
sentence.
</P>
<P>
If such a procedure becomes prevalent, no one can prevent
chaos in the world and every country will allow itself to
question and judge high-ranking officials of other countries in
its own courts. "Then we will have a jungle."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister stressed that the recent developments in
Germany were due to pressures exerted by influential circles,
the Zionists in particular.
</P>
<P>
He also touched on the failure of critical dialog between
Iran and the European Union saying that prior to EU's decision
Iran had announced discontinuation of the talks on the grounds
they were not in the interest of Iran.
</P>
<P>
Asked if such a ruling was not issued in Germany, would Iran
had gone ahead with the dialog, he replied, "Tehran had made it
clear that it would not return to the negotiation table."
</P>
<P>
Suspension of the critical dialog between EU and Iran is one
of latest decisions made by the EU member states at the
ministerial meeting concluded in Luxembourg late last month.
</P>
<P>
The EU also decided to stop the ministerial level contact
between the two sides and continue its arm embargo on Iran as a
protest against Iran for the alleged order by the Iranian leaders
to assassinate four Kurdish leaders in a Berlin restaurant in
1992.

<HEADLINE> India's Scientific Council Flays U.S. Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- India's Council of Scientific and
Industrial Research (CSIR) has strongly objected to U.S.
ambassador to India Frank Wisner's threat to stop collaboration
with Indian scientists if India does not amend its patent law.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of CSIR said here today that conditionalities are
not desirable in science and technology agreements.
</P>
<P>
The science involves flow of knowledge which should be free of
any conditions and India expects other countries not to impose any
extra legal restrictions on it, he said.
</P>
<P>
Frank Wisner had warned at a joint meeting of Indian and
American officials on Tuesday that the future of Indo-U.S. science
and technology cooperation depended on how India resolved issues
like intellectual property rights which inhibit scientific
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. would be unable to negotiate a formal
science and technology agreement and some areas of research and
training would be closed to cooperation if India did not resolve
the issues.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held to work out a strategy for a new science
and technology agreement between the two countries as the existing
one ends in December this year.
</P>
<P>
The CSIR spokesman said that India scrupulously meets its
international obligations as evident from the large number of
collaborations between India and other countries.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: W. African Gas Pipeline Project Faces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A gas pipeline project, aimed at
providing Benin, Togo and Ghana with Nigeria's gas and yielding
500 million U.S. Dollars in the first ten years, seems to be
facing threat by a recent Ghana-Cote d'Ivorie accord.
</P>
<P>
As the project cannot be completed as scheduled for 1998 due
to bureaucratic and political bottlenecks, the accord offers
Ghana gas from Cote d'Ivorie's Lion Gas Field for power supply.
No more details of the accord are known.
</P>
<P>
The project, with a cost of 260 million U.S. Dollars, has been
expected to transport some 50 million standard cubic feet gas
daily from gas-rich Nigeria to the western African countries
through pipeline.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting here Wednesday, Nigerian industrial leaders
expressed fears that the Ghana-Cote d'Ivorie accord may pose a
fresh threat to the project and thus weaken Nigeria's gas
industry and the regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Citing the importance of the project to both national and
sub-regional interest, the industrial leaders called on the
Nigerian government to encourage investment and give incentives
to investors concerned.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria should maintain its active role in investment
opportunities in oil and gas fields and in the cooperation in the
sub-region, Africa and the world, they urged.
</P>
<P>
They appealed to have the gas industry privatized so as to
record significant achievements in the construction of the
project.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, Ghana, Togo and Benin signed an agreement in
September 1995 for the construction, maintenance and operation of
the gas pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The gas pipeline is also expected to cover the entire western
African region around the turning of this century, according to a
plan of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
A steering committee was later established comprising
ministers responsible or their representatives in these
countries, but later failing to coordinate the project funds from
various international sources.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the project owners have not been able to provide
funds and infrastructure necessary for the West African Pipeline
Company, established earlier this year by the four countries to
try to coordinate the project more effectively.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's crude oil and gas resources stand at 20 billion
barrels and 256,000 cubic feet respectively, making for 60 and 96
percent of Africa's potential.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the associated gas is largely being flared in oil
fields of the country.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military Denies Existence of Coup Plotters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior Philippine military
official today denied the existence of a group of military coup
plotters, who have reportedly threatened to launch a coup against
the Ramos administration.
</P>
<P>
General Arnulfo Acedera, chief of the Philippine Armed Forces,
told reporters that there is no such group within the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
"We do not recognize such group even if it really exists," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a group, claimed as "Filipino Soldiers for the
Philippines," issued a statement, saying it will stage a military
coup against the government if President Fidel Ramos will not
support Defense Secretary Renato De Villa's bid for the presidency
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers supportive of De Villa will launch a coup if Ramos
will not fully support or anoint the defense chief as the ruling
party's presidential candidate, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
De Villa, who intends to run for the presidency, has not joined
the ruling Lakas-NUCD (National Union for Christian Democrats),
and has not formally announced his bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Under the Philippine Constitution, President Ramos is serving a
single six-year term and is not allowed to seek re-election in the
1998 elections.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A project called "Sightfirst"
China Action Plan was sponsored here on Wednesday in a bid to
restore the eyesight of 1.75 million cataract patients on the
Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
The project will be undertaken jointly by the Hong Kong and
Macao Lions Club and the Chinese State Council's Coordinating
Committee on Disability for a period of five years, according to
local media reports today.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization's figures show that China has
more than nine million blind people, of which four million cases
were caused by cataracts.
</P>
<P>
However, due to limited resources, every year only about
200,000 patients are able to receive treatment.
</P>
<P>
The China Action Plan will receive 117 million HK dollars (15
million US dollars) from the Lions Club International and 1.2
billion HK dollars (153.85 million US dollars) in funding approved
by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
The project will send 250 medical teams to rural and
poverty-stricken areas in the Chinese mainland over the next five
years, and it will also train 4,000 ophthalmologists and 7,000
support staff.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Warning Against Visiting Macao Unreasonable: Government </HEADLINE>

<P>
MACAO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Macao government said on
Wednesday night that the warning from the Australian authorities
to its citizens against visiting Macao is "inappropriate and
unreasonable."
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the government Tourism Office said that
the Macao government has been informed by the Australian
authorities of its decision to give out a warning to its citizens
planning to travel to Macao.
</P>
<P>
"The warning from the Australian government is pointless,
inappropriate and unreasonable," said the statement. "The Macao
government has instantly expressed the position to the Australian
consulate."
</P>
<P>
The Australian government warns its citizens to "be careful"
when going sightseeing to Macao because of organized crimes in
Macao. But it does not prevent them from traveling to Macao,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the warning from the Australian
authorities may be a result of "exaggerated and distorted report
of foreign media."
</P>
<P>
"Those reports have given Macao a (bad) image," it said. "But
when people traveling to Macao they will find immediately that
their previous (bad) impression on Macao is wrong."
</P>
<P>
A wave of triad-related crimes hit the territory over the past
few months, causing at least 15 deaths and a dozen injuries.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's consumer price
inflation rate continued to moderate in April, with the Composite
Consumer Price Index showing a year-on-year increase of 5.6
percent, lower than that of 5.9 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
The Composite CPI is compiled on the basis of the combined
expenditure pattern of all households, according to an official
release today.
</P>
<P>
Analyzed by component, faster year-on-year increases than the
overall average in April were recorded for clothing and footwear;
housing and miscellaneous goods. Meanwhile, those components with
slower year-on-year increases were durable goods; meals bought
away from home and transport.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippine Muslim Leader to Deliver Region Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The rebel-turned governor of the
Philippines' Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), Nur
Misuari, will deliver an address on May 26 on his performance
since taking office last October, the Philippine News Agency said
today.
</P>
<P>
The much-awaited state of the region address, originally slated
for April 28, was postponed due to a big blaze which gutted a
hotel in Cotabato city, capital of Maguindanao province and the
seat of Misuari's office, on April 26.
</P>
<P>
The fire killed 27 people, some of whom were guests invited to
attend the Mindanao Regional Legislative Assembly meeting to
listen to Misuari's speech. The cause of the fire is still under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Misuari's address will also focus on the achievement,
particularly in the economic area, made by the Southern Philippine
Council for Peace and Development which was also chaired by
Misuari.
</P>
<P>
The council was formed to push the development of southern
Philippines in line with a peace agreement signed last September
between the government and the MNLF.
</P>
<P>
The landmark peace accord ended the 28-year-old war launched by
the MNLF for an independent Islamic state. Misuari, MNLF chairman,
was later elected governor of the ARMM in an election held in
Muslim Mindanao in accordance with the accord.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolian Grasslands Getting Closer To Outside World (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Years ago, the well-known Chinese
folk song writer Wang Luobin picked up a song, which he re-wrote
with the words: "In that remote place, there's a good girl,"
giving people a taste of the beauty of a pastoral landscape and an
impression that it was far away from ordinary life.
</P>
<P>
Today, however, the grasslands referred to in that song, what
with the development of modern transportation and
telecommunications, do not seem quite so remote any more.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Bade Ma Surong, a herdsman in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region in north China, seemed quite at home talking
about "cloned sheep", a strange new topic elsewhere in the world,
even though he lives in a felt tent in the midst of the Hulun Buir
Grasslands.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of miles away, in a little village that holds 50
pastoral households in the Tengger Desert in the western part of
Inner Mongolia, all the families can receive television programs
from southern China.
</P>
<P>
Improvements in modern telecommunications and transportation
facilities and the growing economic contacts with other parts of
China and elsewhere have reduced the physical space and
psychological distance between the grasslands and the outside
world, one local scholar says.
</P>
<P>
"The herdsmen no longer feel unfamiliar with the outside world,
and people from the outside world have more ways of getting to
know life on the grasslands. Therefore, the gap between the remote
grasslands and the outside world has been narrowed," said Pan
Zhaodong, a research fellow with the Inner Mongolia Branch of the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia sprawls across a 1.18-million- sq.km. area in
northern China, and is the longest and narrowest autonomous region
running from east to west in China.
</P>
<P>
The grasslands were considered remote because of the lack of
communications and the inconvenience in travelling, and the lack
of development in the past. As a result, local people had little
chance to have any contact with the outside world, Pan
explained.

<TEXT>
<P>
It was only 50 years ago when horses were the sole means
of getting to the pastoral areas from outside. But, since the
founding of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in 1947, travel
and communications have improved significantly, and digital and
program-controlled long-distance telephones are commonplace in
pastoral households. The installed telephone capacity is more than
1.2 million lines in the region.
</P>
<P>
The modern communications technology of mobile phones and
beepers, satellites and optical fibers are in wide use. By the end
of July, all townships in Inner Mongolia will have access to
phones.
</P>
<P>
In January, radio and television programs reached the whole of
Inner Mongolia, Herdsmen living deep in the grasslands could
get nearly 20 TV channels, some of which arrive bilingually in
both Mongolian and Chinese.
</P>
<P>
In Inner Mongolia these days, there are 50,000 km of highways
linking 90 percent of the townships. There are airports in the
cities of Huhhot, Hailar, Baotou and Xilinhot, linking Inner
Mongolia with more than 20 cities in other parts of the country,
as well as Hong Kong and two cities in Mongolia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
All this has greatly changed people's lives, an official with
the regional people's government says. Most herdsmen have left the
nomadic life and have settled down, with some having opened
businesses in other parts of the country, or abroad even.
</P>
<P>
"If you talk with the herdsmen who wear jeans, ride
motorcycles, and have a mobile phone in their hands, you will
sense how big the change is," the official noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese enterprises can learn to be
more successful at raising funds overseas, according to a seminar
that opened in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was sponsored by the newspaper China Securities and
BZW Asia Limited, a division of Barclays Bank PLC. Participants
agreed that Chinese enterprises should use the opportunity to
raise funds in overseas markets because there is an incredible
amount of capital in developed Western countries that is looking
for ideal investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar attracted nearly 200 officials, experts,
and senior management personnel from the State Economic and Trade
Commission, the State Planning Commission, the People's Bank of
China, and the Development Research Center of the State Council,
as well as from large domestic and overseas financial institutions
and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
To date, 29 Chinese enterprises have been listed in Hong Kong,

<HEADLINE> Impact of U.S. Sanctions Limited: Thai Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman
Surapong Jayanama said that it is unlikely the U.S. economic
sanctions on Myanmar would pressure ASEAN to defer its decision on
the admission of Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos.
</P>
<P>
he said, "ASEAN has always said that its decision to admit
Myanmar along with Laos and Cambodia would not be affected by
outside pressure," according to a report in the Nation today.
</P>
<P>
He said that in fact U.S. president Bill Clinton's executive
order on the economic sanctions could be counter-productive as it
could push ASEAN into pressing ahead with its decision just to
save face.
</P>
<P>
Last year, leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) decided to let the three Southeast Asian countries
to join the grouping simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
However, last month the U.S. government sent out message that
it would not like to see Myanmar join ASEAN on the grounds of the
country's "woeful" human rights record.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the U.S. sanction order, Surapong said the impact
on Myanmar would be "only limited" as American companies already
investing in Myanmar would not be affected.
</P>
<P>
He also said that some European countries are disturbed by the
U.S. decision and prepared to file complaints with the World Trade
Organization for the U.S. attempt to link non-trade issues (human
rights and democracy) with trade.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Cotton Attracting Chinese And Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Fu Jiankang, a 24-year-old native of
Sichuan, travelled 5,000 km in 1991 from his home in southwest
China to the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the northwest to
get a piece of land to grow cotton.
</P>
<P>
Within seven years, the land on which he had a contract had
grown from 0.6 ha to seven ha, 40 times the size of the plot of
ground he had tilled in his native home.
</P>
<P>
"In each of the past six years, I earned 100,000 yuan, the
equivalent of the combined income of my family for four years," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I will invest 70,000 yuan, 50 times the annual income of a
Chinese farmer, on my field this year," he added.
</P>
<P>
When asked why he came to Xinjiang, Fu explained that
agriculture in the region is highly mechanized and encourages
individuals sign contracts to open up farmland.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Chinese farmers like Fu have come a long way from
home to Xinjiang to get involved in cotton cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang produced an average of 900,000 tons of cotton each of
the past three years, accounting for a quarter of the national
total. And it has turned 433,300 ha of uncultivated land into
fertile farmland with three billion yuan provided by a dozen other
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Last September, the regional government opened 466,600 ha of
wasteland to overseas investors. Israel, Canada, the United States
and Hong Kong have all shown a great deal of interest.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has provided 375 million US dollars in loans for
an agricultural project in the Tarim Basin, the largest
agricultural loan ever provided by the World Bank in China.
</P>
<P>
John Weatherhogg, an agro-economist of the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations, said that Xinjiang has great
potential for developing its cotton industry and that now is a
good time to invest.
</P>
<P>
A local agriculture official said the region is building a
66,600-ha cotton production base at a cost of 9.4 billion yuan,
and that both domestic and overseas investors are welcome.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Advance Blocked By Opposition Defector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A powerful defector of opposing
factions blocked the Afghan Islamic militia Taliban into the
capital of northwestern Faryab province despite Taliban's claims
that the defector joined its ranks, according to reports reaching
here today.
</P>
<P>
General Abdul Malik, who quit the ranks of Uzbek warlord Rashid
Dostum, has so far not allowed the Taliban to continue their
advance and enter into the provincial capital of Maimana, the
reports quoted sources there as saying.
</P>
<P>
Maimana is situated 220 kilometers (136 miles) west of
Mazar-i-Sharif, the headquarters of Dostum who is allied with the
ousted Afghan government and a Shiite-Moslem faction.
</P>
<P>
However, a Taliban spokesman denied the reports, claiming that
the joint Taliban-Malik forces are pushing into Dostum-controlled
neighboring Jowzjan province.
</P>
<P>
In a last-ditch effort, Dostum was said to have sent his
representatives to Faryab province for reconciliation with Malik.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Dostum's representatives were trying to
persuade Malik to return to Dostum's side by warning him that the
Taliban would dump him once they complete their stronghold of
northern Afghanistan.

NAIROBI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The first African Tourism
Conference will be held in Nairobi in September as part of an
Africa Travel Market Week to be celebrated throughout Sub-Saharan
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The local daily newspaper East African Standard today reported
that the meeting would provide a vital educational forum for
delegates to discuss current and future trends in inbound and
outbound travel in Sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which is scheduled to take place immediately prior
to the African Travel Market in Johannesburg, South Africa, is
designed to enhance the existing programs in the region and help
draft strategies to assist the emerging market.
</P>
<P>
Subjects to be discussed at the meeting will cover conference
business opportunities, business travel in Africa, misconceptions
of Africa, marketing of regional tourism and media in promotion
of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Tourism Minister Protus Momanyi was quoted as saying
that there was need for tourism destinations like Kenya and
Africa as a whole to redouble their efforts in tourism promotion
and marketing as Africa accounted for only a mere 1.2 percent of
the world volume of tourism flow.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the Executive Council meeting of the World
Tourism Organization, which ended yesterday in Philippines, that
Africa also needed to diversify tourism products and tourist source
markets in order to maximize the industry's benefits to the
people.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's tourism industry accounts for 37 percent of the
national total foreign exchange earnings and caters for the
employment of 9.1 percent of the total wage earners.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry in Kenya has evolved to become number one
single exchange earner ahead of coffee and tea which are the
leading export earners.

<HEADLINE> China's Tourism Growth Rate Surpassing National Economy's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The tourism industry in China has
grown at an annual rate of 22.6 percent over the past 18 years,
five percentage points higher than that of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Wendong, vice chairman of China National Tourism
Administration, told a national conference on duty-free business
which opened yesterday in Beijing that, for the past 18 years,
China's foreign exchange earnings from tourism showed a 38-fold
increase, to 10.2 billion US dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"China's tourism and travel industry have retained their
growth, with tourists from all over the world, and double-digit
growth last year," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese central and local governments are
placing great importance on the business, with many areas listing
it as a "pillar" or a "dragon head".
</P>
<P>
On the industry's prospects, Cheng said that work will
concentrate on raising the scale and quality of tourism to make it
a major part of the national economy and to turn China into a
major tourist country by the beginning of the 21 century.

<HEADLINE> China Turning Mountain Forests into Food Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China is using mountain forests to
get more food from xylophytes, or woody plants, in its search for
better ways to feed its growing population.
</P>
<P>
The country produces more than 1.8 billion kg of foodstuff from
woody plants annually and 160 million kg of oil, equivalent to 1.2
billion kg of paddy crops and 800 million kg of soybean,
respectively, according to a woody plant institute.
</P>
<P>
The mass production of food from woody plants not only helps
the ecology, but also provides abundant food and oil
supplies. China has more than 100 species of woody plants suitable
for food production, and over 200 kinds of trees suitable for oil,
and more than six million ha of xylophytes.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Zhuji city in Zhejiang Province in east China turned
wasteland on mountainsides into arable land and planted Chinese
torreya (Torreya grandis), the fruit of which sold at more than 30
yuan per kg last year, making some growers rich as a result.
</P>
<P>
Woody plant food and oils are healthy as well, with their low
cholesterol, so demand for them is increasing. Food output from
major woody plants is expected to reach four billion kg and oil
output 1.1 billion kg by the end of the century.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Parliament Postpones Approval of State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's parliament has said
the government's ambitious revenue boosting plan contained in the
1997-98 budget is unconstitutional, officials sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The Finance and Economics Affairs Committee of the Kuwaiti
National Assembly postponed the approval of the budget at a
session last night.
</P>
<P>
The committee told the government that the plan to boost
non-oil revenuers by over 200 million Kuwait dinars (660 million
U.S. dollars) through charges and taxation violated the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
By law, the government is not allowed to raise charges on
public services without any parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
It said the projected increase also runs counter to the
Charges Freeze Law which was issued by the previous parliament
in 1995 and bans any increase in the public charges beyond its
DPA158WSD031S22PEQL17:0817:080521
level on December 31, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The government has submitted a bill two months ago asking the
National Assembly to change the Charges Freeze Law for all
services except electricity and water.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaitis enjoy a cradle-to-grave welfare system that offers
free education and health care and heavily-subsidized state
services such as electricity and water.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the Kuwaiti government proposed a 4.37
billion dinars (14.42 billion dollars) budget expenditure and 3.2
billion dinars (10.56 billion dollars) revenues for the fiscal
year of 1997-98 starting from this July 1, with a net deficit of
1.17 billion dinars (3.86 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 3.2 billion Kuwait dinars revenues projected in the fiscal
year draft budget include a projected oil revenues of 2.56
billion dinars (7.67 billion dollars) at an estimated selling
price of 13 dollars per barrel. Oil exports account for around 80
percent of the state income.
</P>
<P>
The budget also proposed to increase non-oil revenues by more
than 40 percent during the coming fiscal year, generating as
much as 645 million dinars (2.128 billion dollars) from
non-oil sources, mainly the increase and imposition of charges and
fees on public services.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti cabinet approved the draft law, calling on the
National Assembly to allow ministries to impose new charges and
increase the existing ones on public services in February. The
draft budget also has to be approved by the head of the state
before it becomes law.

SHENYANG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The northeastern Chinese city of
Shenyang has decided to spend 10 million yuan (1.2 million US
dollars) each year on tourism, as it becomes an important business
for this old industrial base and provincial capital of Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang is rich in natural resouces and tourist attractions,
but tourism revenues now only account for a meager four percent of
the city's GNP. This does not reflect its status as a major city,
city officials say.
</P>
<P>
In its latest move to boost tourism and the travel industry,
the city has decided to spend money renovating a number of
historical sites like the Shenyang Palace Museum and the Northern
and Eastern Tombs.
</P>
<P>
The money will also be spent on new attractions like the
Shenyang Amusement Park, the Strange Slope, and Xinmin Minor West
Lake.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will also be made to jointly develop scenic spots and
design tourist routes with the neighboring cities of Anshan,
Fushun and Benxi.
</P>
<P>
The city has over 150 institutions directly involved in tourism
and had over 100,000 overseas tourists last year.

HARARE, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has with immediate effect
recognised the transitional government of Zaire led by
self-proclaimed President Laurent Kabila and has pledged to
cooperate with his government in all spheres.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the daily the Herald yesterday,

some countries in the region to officially recognise Kabila because
they wanted to do so when a government was constituted. Until
yesterday that government had not been appointed.

Now that most African governments recognised Kabila's presidency,
the new leader was entitled to attend the coming OAU summit to be
held in Harare next month, the incoming Chairman of the OAU, Mugabe
said.
</P>
<P>
An official invitation would soon be extended to him, he said.
</P>
<P>
On demands by the international community that Kabila should
produce a track record that reflects his respect of human rights
and commitment to democracy, Mugabe said it was too early to make
such demands from him.
</P>
<P>
He added that it was expecting the impossible from a man who
took over a country. enditem

<HEADLINE> China Expecting 10 Percent Economic Growth in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China's economic growth rate in
1997 is expected to be around 10 percent, with price increases
being held to around five percent, according to Qiu Xiaohua, chief
economist with the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In analyzing China's advantages and disadvantages in economic
development, Qiu told a seminar in Beijing on Wednesday that China
maintained rapid economic growth in the first four months of this
year, with an 11.4 percent year-on-year increase in industrial
output, and a rise of only 2.3 percent in retail prices. The GDP
rose by 9.4 percent during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Exports increased 26.9 percent, while imports dropped 0.5
percent during the four-month period, and China's international
payments are improving, and the financial situation is basically
normal.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of last year, China's economic performance
had another period of stable development, and the upward trend
will go further this year, Qiu said, attributing the rapid growth
and stable prices to macro-economic controls, the improved
relation of supply and demand, and successful price control in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The bottleneck in China's economic development has been
markedly improved thanks to large-scale construction of basic
industries and infrastructure, and less uncontrolled production in
the past few years, he said, noting that the stable international
situation and increasing world trade are favorable to China's
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Priority should be given to controlling fixed asset investment,
the money supply, and agriculture, as well as the structural
adjustment and enterprise reforms, to maintain a longer period of
stable economic growth.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 22 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province,
one of the most developed areas in China, is increasing efforts to
make its agriculture more efficient and more market-oriented.
</P>
<P>
It increased the output value of commercial farm products from
14 billion yuan in 1995 to more than 80 billion yuan last year,
and now two-thirds of its farm produce is sold elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
It also has more than 4,000 farm markets that have helped
increase the commodity rate of agriculture to over 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
It has established more than 5,000 farm produce bases, covering
about 2.6 million ha of cultivated land. High-quality rice paddies
take up more than 70 percent of that.
</P>
<P>
The province has a large number of chicken and animal breeding
farms, with 30 species of animals bred on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture-related enterprises have greatly helped the scale
of operation and integration of trade and industry with
agriculture. The Guangdong Jinman Group Company, for example, is
helping 30 townships raise eels and has become one of the biggest
eel producers in the world, with a total annual output worth 1.5
billion yuan.

<P>
SHENYANG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Anshan, an industrial city in
northeast China, has asked institutions that collect fees from
overseas-funded enterprises to fill in forms so that it can put a
stop to the practice of random charging.
</P>
<P>
The collectors have to state the item, the regulation, the

card" for any charges like funds, membership fees, or insurance
premiums, according to a recent decision by city authorities.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made following a study by the city government
which found that while most of the 187 fees being charged were
reasonable, there were problems with unauthorized charges or
overcharging.
</P>
<P>
In order to protect the interests of overseas-funded
enterprises, the city government has defined 149 items as being
reasonable for payment and has urged putting a halt to any
unreasonable charges.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 22 (Xinhua) -- FIFA have warned organisers of
the world youth soccer championship in Malaysia next month to
guard against attempts to bribe players.
</P>
<P>
The warning came after attempts to fix the same event in Qatar
two years ago by Southeast Asian syndidates. Three of five people
were caught came from Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"If it can happen in Qatar it can happen here," said Asian
Football Confederation general secretary Peter Velappan, who is
also the FIFA's ground inspections representative for the
tournament from June 18 to July 5.
</P>
<P>
Velappan added: "To check match fixing we have to be extra
vigilant. The local organising committee will have to work closely
with the police and team officials at the respective venues to
draw up some guidelines to keep track of the bookies."
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, over 100 players and officials were banned from
football by FIFA after being caught in one of the biggest match
fixing scandals in football.
</P>
<P>
There were also attempts by Malaysian bookies to fix matches in
last year's Tiger Cup in Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Harvest to Drop by 50 Percent In Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's food and cash
crops production, particularly cotton and coffee, will decrease
by 50 percent this year due to severe drought.
</P>
<P>
Governor of Bank of Tanzania (BOT) Idris Rashidi said this
when meeting with Finnish business delegation recently.
</P>
<P>
He said proper measures were being taken to avert
economic problems, assuring people of enough food supply in the
wake of this alarming situation.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the economy has grown by four percent,
Tanzania should struggle to balance its trade.
</P>
<P>
Rashidi noted that the level of imports was 50 percent less
than what was expected.
</P>
<P>
"BOT was struggling to make sure that government expenditure
matches revenue collected to avoid borrowing from banks", he
said.
</P>
<P>
In order to liberalize the banking system, Rashidi said 16
financial institutions have been licensed to operate in Tanzania
and BOT has remained as supervisor and regulator of the banking
system.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government-owned National Bank of Commerce
(NBC) was currently undergoing major restructuring which is to
eventually lead to its privatization.
</P>
<P>
"NBC will be split into three organs within it there will be a
trade bank, a corporate bank and a micro-finance bank. This is to
lead into big competition with foreign banks coming to invest in
Tanzania", Rashidi added.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Troops Plan to Remain in Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkish security forces will not
pull out of northern Iraq until the region is swept free of the
rebels of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), senior military
sources said here.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News today quoted the sources as saying
"The planned end of the operation is August. Until then we plan to
totally clear the region from the PKK terrorists, demolishing all
PKK camps and completely cutting logistic support."
</P>
<P>
The sources said Turkey will also "strongly urge" Iraq's
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) leader Jalal Talabani, who is
controlling an area near Iran's border with Iraq, not to support
the PKK in the region and also ask to provide stability in the
region in favor of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported that Syria,
which gives the biggest support to the PKK organization, has
built up troops at the northern Iraqi border by using the
excuse of a military exercise.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq have also reportedly amassed forces around
the area of focus, which was carved out of northern Iraq as
a safe haven for Kurds.
</P>
<P>
The operation, which was launched on May 14, has drawn
criticism from the United Nations, western countries and
especially the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates and Syria said Wednesday in a
joint statement that they were deeply concerned over the Turkish
military incursion in northern Iraq and urged Ankara to pull
its troops out of the region.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a near 13-year-old separatist war
which has claimed over 23,000 lives in eastern and southeastern
Turkey since August 1984.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
is expected to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the
next few days in an effort to break the deadlock in the Mideast
peace process, Israel Radio reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
Weizman and Mubarak discussed the stalemate in the peace
negotiations over a telephone call on Wednesday night, and agreed
to meet in the coming days to find a new formula to renew the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's Director-General Arye Shumer told Israel Radio that
the meeting will probably be held in Egypt, but added that
details of the planned meeting have not been finalized yet.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, Weizman also called Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu to inform him of the telephone conversation,
initiated by Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu later summoned Mohammed Bassiouny, the Egyptian
ambassador to Israel, and asked him to convey a message to
Mubarak, calling on Egypt to show positive interventions in the
diplomatic moves.
</P>
<P>
Reports here revealed that the European Union (EU) sources had
told Israel that Egypt was preparing a new initiative for both
the Palestinian and Syrian tracks in the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said that United States special Middle East
coordinator, Dennis Ross attempted to bring together all the
different peace initiatives during his next visit to the region.
</P>
<P>
Ross is also expected to make a public call on both the
Israelis and Palestinians to renew their peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the two sides stalled again in March
after Israel started building a controversial new Jewish
neighborhood at Har Homa (Jabal Abu Ghoneim) on the southeastern
outskirts of Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as their
future capital.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have said that Israel must stop the
construction before talks can resume, while Israel is insisting
that the Palestinian National Authority must crack down on
extremist activities to reestablish full security
cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has decided
to recast the foreign investment policy for the auto sector, a
DPA105VTA006S22TEQL14:4114:411585
government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The proposed policy stipulates a minimum initial investment of
100 million US dollars in foreign direct investment (FDI) ventures
in this sector.
</P>
<P>
The new policy guidelines, being finalized currently, also
stipulate a minimum indigenization level of 50 percent in the
first two years of operations of FDI projects in the auto sector.
</P>
<P>
It also proposes that the foreign investment ventures should
have two-thirds of their production indigenized within a

</P>
<P>
The new policy has been framed with the twin objectives of
making sure that only serious players, which have long-term plans
in India, enter this sector and the entry of automobile
multinationals play a complimentary role in strengthening the
domestic auto component industry, the same source said.  enditem

<P>
SINGAPORE, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Singapore singed a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) with the United Nations (UN) on Singapore's
contributions to the UN Standby Arrangements, the Foreign Ministry
said in a statement here today.
</P>
<P>
It said that the signing ceremony was held in the office of Mr.
Bernard Miyet, under-secretary for Peacekeeping Operations in New
York on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Countries subscribing to the Standby Arrangements are required
to provide the UN with a list of troops and equipment which the UN
can deploy at short notice for peacekeeping operations. This
enables the UN to be more responsive and effective in deploying
troops and equipment to trouble spots.
</P>
<P>
Singapore has, since January 1997, subscribed to the UN Standby
Arrangements. The signing of the MOU formalizes Singapore's
commitment to the UN Standby Arrangements, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 65 countries which have subscribed to the UN Standby
Arrangements to date, Singapore is among the only six countries to
have signed MOUs with the UN, it said.
</P>
<P>
Under its commitments, Singapore will place planning officers,
military observers, medical personnel and police officers on
standby for UN peacekeeping operations, as well as helicopters and
transport aircraft on standby for the support of UN peacekeeping
missions.
</P>
<P>
"As a small country with limited manpower resources, Singapore
is unable to participate in every UN peacekeeping mission," the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"Nonetheless, Singapore will continue to participate in
missions in which it can make a valuable and effective
contribution to the maintenance of international peace and
stability," it said.

<HEADLINE> India Attains Self-sufficiency in Cotton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- India has attained
self-sufficiency in cotton with production crossing the 16-million
bales mark in 1996-97, a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
A five-fold increase in production had been recorded from
1949-50 onwards, when it stood at 2.75 million bales to about 16
million bales in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
The area under cotton cultivation had simultaneously risen from
4.93 million hectares to about 8.8 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
India has been able to export 0.5 to 1.5 million bales of
cotton annually, which was more than 22.5 percent of the total
export revenue.
</P>
<P>
Productivity had increased from about 87 kg to about 299 kg per
hectare, accompanied by an increase in the area of crop under
irrigated conditions from 2 percent in 1950 to about 31 percent in
the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The productivity level, however, did not compare favorably with
some of the other cotton growing countries. The productivity would
have to be stepped up from 300 kg to 400 kg of cotton per hectare
to meet the country's demand of 19 million bales by the year 2000,
the same official said.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM's Nepal Visit to Be Objective-Oriented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral's upcoming visit to Nepal, unlike that in the past, will be
meaningful and objective-oriented, a foreign affairs expert here
said today.
</P>
<P>
Gujral's visit, expected in the first week of June, will help
develop a "model relation" between the two countries in a
"concrete" manner, the official daily the Rising Nepal quoted a
senior Nepali diplomat as saying.
</P>
<P>
The first visit to Nepal by an Indian prime minister since 1992
is expected to thrash out ways to strengthen bilateral economic
ties, especially cooperation in water resources, tourism and
industry, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to Yadav Kant Silwal, former general secretary of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Gujral's
visit would help form a new dimension in Nepal-India relations and
promote Nepal's opportunities for joint investment and trade
activities.
</P>
<P>
Gujral's predecessor H. D. Deve Gowda earlier canceled his
scheduled Nepal visit twice in November 1996 and March 1997
respectively due to his mother's death and the change of
government here.
</P>
<P>
As to the Bhutanese refugee problem, on which India has always
refused Nepal's demand for its mediation, Silwal said India should
be asked to play an active role instead of a mediator in the
solution of the lingering issue. India handles foreign and defense
affairs for Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100,000 Bhutanese, mostly of Nepalese origin, have been
living in eastern Nepal since 1990 when they were forced under
Bhutan's Ethnic cleansing policy to fled to Nepal via the Indian
territory.
</P>
<P>
During Gujral's visit, the documents about a landmark treaty on
the integrated development of the Mahakali border river between
the two countries will be exchanged, Nepali Foreign Secretary
Kumar Gyawali said.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali parliament last September ratified the Mahakali
treaty, under which the two countries will jointly launch a
6,480-megawatt multi-purpose hydro project on the border river,
about 450 west of Kathmandu.

<HEADLINE> India Among Top 3 Investment Draws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- India has emerged as the world's
third most preferred destination for foreign direct investment
(FDI) in the medium term of five to ten years, behind only China
and the United States, said the World Economic Forum in its Global
Competitiveness Report 1997.
</P>
<P>
Apart from China and the U.S., India has emerged as a top
choice as an investment location mainly because of its market size
and expectations of further liberalization of capital movement
across its border, improvement in domestic institutions and
rationalization of economic policies to foster a favorable climate
for multinational companies, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The opening up of vast countries such as China and India has
provided unprecedented opportunities for investors from advanced
industrial and newly industrialized countries to seek better
returns by investing in those capital-starved, emerging market
economies," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of FDI in these markets was caused by their
commitment to market-oriented structural reform, which has
improved the trade and investment climate and raised the expected
rate of return on capital in those countries, the report further
said.
</P>
<P>
The flow of FDI increased rapidly during the 1990s and its
level in the emerging markets grew by more than 170 percent from
1991 to 1995, while investment in the advanced industrial
countries increased by less than half that rate, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Taliban Forces Mass Around Dostum's Stronghold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 22 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to stop Taliban's
advance, Afghanistan's anti-Taliban alliance was massing their
fighters around Mazar-e-Sharif, the stronghold of Uzbek warlord
Rashid Dostum, about 300 kilometers northwest of Kabul, reports
reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Ousted Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani and his former
military chief, Ahamd Masood, have sent a number of their soldiers
to Mazar-e-Sharif to help Dostum defend the city against an
expected Taliban's assault in the coming days, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Sources in Mazar-e-Sharif claimed over 2,000 men were flown
there from Masood-controlled Taloqan, capital of Takhar province
bordering Tajikistan, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taliban forces have reportedly reached Maimana,
capital of Faryab province in northwestern Afghanistan, to link up
with forces of General Abdul Malik, who staged a strong rebellion
against Dostum early this week.
</P>
<P>
A senior Taliban official was quoted as saying that their
fighters reached Maimana Wednesday morning and were handed over
most of prisoners of war captured by Malik's men two days ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Taliban officials were holding talks
with Malik in Maimana to plan strategies for the future, adding
that the two forces were cooperating and considering joint
military activities.
</P>
<P>
Malik, one of Dostum's most trusted lieutenants, had announced
support for the Taliban after defecting Dostum's camp. He defended
his action by arguing that it aimed at protecting the territorial
integrity and unity of the country.
</P>
<P>
In a last-ditch effort, Dostum was said to have sent a group of
elders to Faryab province for reconciliation with Malik. Sources
in Mazar-e-Sharif said the elders were trying to persuade Malik to
return to Dostum's side by warning him that the Taliban would dump
him once they complete their stronghold of northern Afghanistan.
However, Afghan sources said Malik had rejected Dostum's overtures
and had made it clear he was not commander of its troops.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Approves New Tax Rates to Boost Revenues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has decided to
increase excise tax rates for nine products in the hope of
bringing in 2.58 billion baht (about 100 million US dollars) in
revenue in the remaining four months of fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
The government is under pressure to increase revenue because
expected tax revenue shortfall this year would likely to result in
the first budget deficit in a decade.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on Wednesday, the cabinet also decided to cut the
proposed 1998 fiscal budget by 26 billion baht (about 1 billion
dollars) to 982 billion baht (37.77 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the cabinet already reduced expenditures for the 1997
fiscal budget by 59 billion baht (2.27 billion dollars) to 925
billion baht (35.58 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Fiscal 1998 begins on October 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Of the nine product categories which face immediately effective
tax rises, two-stroke motorcycles, cars and flashlight batteries,
and marble and granite, all of which are considered to be harmful
to the environment, will be assessed excise taxes of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Up until now they have been free from excise tax.
</P>
<P>
The remaining six items -- soft drinks, chandeliers, perfume,
crystal glassware, horse racetrack entrance fees, and air
conditioners -- would see tax increases ranging from two to seven
percentage points.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Police and the armed forces have
tightened security in Colombo in a bid to prevent possible Tamil
rebel attacks, police sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, a 12-member Black Tiger suicide squad
of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has arrived in the
capital city.
</P>
<P>
Quoting intelligence reports, the sources said the squad had
been assigned to assassinate a key ruling party politician within
three months.
</P>
<P>
The threat posed by the Black Tiger suicide squad and measures
needed to counter it were discussed when the Colombo Security
Council met last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Security units of three key government figures have been
informed of the new threat posed by the suicide squad, the sources
noted.
</P>
<P>
They added that all three services and police are involved in
security operations aimed at tracking down infiltrators.
</P>
<P>
Security check points have been increased on all the roads
leading to the capital city and the armed forces have reinforced
patrols at all the important facilities such as government
institutions, oil refineries, power stations, radio and TV
stations, according to defense sources here.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the LTTE rebels who have been fighting a 14-year
guerrilla war for a separate state in the country, launched

<HEADLINE> World Tourism Leaders Meeting Opens in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 tourism leaders,
including 15 ministers, from 60 countries and regions gathered
here today for the first time to find ways addressing negative
issues related to the development of tourism.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Fidel Ramos delivered a keynote speech at
the opening ceremony of the World Tourism Leaders Meeting,
co-hosted by the World Tourism Organization and the Philippine
Department of Tourism.
</P>
<P>
"For certain, the growth in global tourism has also brought on
its share of problems and complications -- some of which are
serious enough to threaten the social cohesion and ecological
equilibrium of communities," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
These problems are among the urgent reasons why the leaders
from the tourism sector from all over the world gathered here
today, the president said.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, these problems mainly include
sexual exploitation of children and women, environmental
degradation, drug trafficking, incidence of crimes and other
negative issues affecting the development of tourism.
</P>
<P>
Ramos called for action against these problems in a bid to
develop clean and sustainable tourism around the world.
</P>
<P>
There should be more codes of conduct and self-regulation in
the tourism industry, more information resources, such as
databases and more effective laws and agreements on global
extradition as tourism continues to expand worldwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting is expected to work out a Manila
Declaration on the Social Impact of Tourism.

MOSCOW, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian Prime Minister
Stepanovich Ling said in Minsk today that the economy will be
revitalized over the next three years, enabling the country to
enter the 21st century with prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In a short-term government working program submitted to
parliament, Ling said the economic stability which started last
year would be strengthened this year, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, state-owned companies will be divided into
semi-privatized and private companies. The government will give
full support to the development of key enterprises and help
relieve them of the burden of excess costs such as welfare
payments.
</P>
<P>
The program also requires the government to reduce the use of
barter in trade and further open the foreign currency market.
</P>
<P>
Ling stressed that his government would neither carry out
complete privatization, or turn all land over to private
ownership, nor dissolve all the collective or state-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
Belarus' economy began to recover last year after several years
of recession following independence in 1991.

</P>
<P>
Primakov told a press conference here after meeting with his

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 21 (Xinhua) -- NATO's eastward expansion will not
bring new safety guarantee to Europe, Belarussian President
Alexander Lukashenko said today.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the first conference of military officers of the
Belarussian armed forces, Lukashenko said if NATO's expansion
became irreversible, his country would take all necessary measures
to minimize possible negative impact arising from it.
</P>
<P>
The Belarussian president hoped the ties between Belarus and
NATO could be set up on the basis of trust, frankness and
partnership.
</P>
<P>
He said the modernized armed forces of Belarus will contribute
to the establishment of such relations.
</P>
<P>
Belarussian Defense Minister Alexandr Chumakov accused NATO of
its obstinate stand on eastward expansion, which he said has
caused unprecedented tension among countries in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said that Belarussian servicemen should not ignore the
statements of some Western politicians over the redivision of
Europe and deployment of nuclear weapons in new NATO member states.
</P>
<P>
Chumakov disclosed that Belarus has cut the number of its armed
forces from 250,000 to 83,000 over the past five years.

<HEADLINE> Albanians to Vote on Restoration of Monarchy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Sali Berisha
signed a decree today to hold a referendum on restoring the
monarchy on the same day as nationwide parliamentary elections,
due on June 29.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made following a law passed by the National
Assembly (parliament) on May 13 allowing a referendum on whether
the country should return to a constitutional monarchy or remain a
republic.
</P>
<P>
Albania's King Leka, 58, has been in exile since he was a baby
when his father King Zog fled the country in the face of invading
Italian fascists in 1939.
</P>
<P>
He returned to the country in April after two months of rioting
which followed the collapse of pyramid investment schemes in which
thousands of Albanian families lost their life savings.
</P>
<P>
King Leka, who sees himself as a unifying factor in the
troubled country, met President Berisha on his return and got him
to promise to hold a referendum on the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
However, there is still uncertainty surrounding the
parliamentary elections themselves.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, led by the Socialist Party, the second largest
party in the country, have threatened to boycott the elections,
saying a new draft election law passed by the parliament on May 16
favored Berisha's ruling Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party and many other parties boycotted the vote
on the law and demanded amendments.
</P>
<P>
After several rounds of negotiations, differences still exist
between the Democratic Party and other parties on the revision of
the election law.
</P>
<P>
Although opposition leaders warned on Wednesday of possible
manipulation and demanded strict monitoring of the vote, it was
still not clear if the opposition would take part.
</P>
<P>
After day-long talks with the parties and government, Prime
Minister Bashkim Fino on Wednesday sent a letter to Franz
Vranitzky, the special envoy to Albania from the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), asking for
international monitors to oversee the whole electoral process,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
"The final solution to ensure free, fair and equal elections
where all would participate and not contest the result, would be to
guarantee intensive monitoring of all levels of the electoral
process," he said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Fatos Nano, leader of the Socialists, said full monitoring
would be enough to persuade his party to stand in the elections,
even under the current law, the reports added.

<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The first sustainable development
project under a program geared for the 21st century has been
agreed in China, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The first project of the UN-sponsored environmental protection
program for China is focused on development and conservation in
the Yellow River Delta.
</P>
<P>
Experts have completed a panoramic development plan based on a
two-year feasibility study on the economic development, ecosystem,
environment and natural resources in the delta areas.
</P>
<P>
It is the first project out of China's 62 priority programs to
receive the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) assistance.
</P>
<P>
Progress has been made in the project since it was started in
March 1995. More efforts are still needed for water resource
management, water quality surveillance and flood prevention and
control in the Yellow River Delta, said an official at the
Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management of the
Netherlands, which is devoted to the development of the delta.
</P>
<P>
The delta development will benefit the northern and part
of central China. The delta, abundant in land, water, oil, tourism
and natural resources, was listed as a major production base for
grain and cotton by the state in 1995. The paper said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Breed 42 Giant Pandas by Artificial Insemination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have successfully bred
42 giant pandas by artificial insemination at a research centre in
China's southwestern province of Sichuan, where about 80 percent
of the endangered species inhabit.
</P>
<P>
The Chengdu Giant Pandas Reproduction Research Base started
breeding the giant pandas by artificial insemination in 1980 and have
successfully made 28 giant pandas pregnant, producing 48 pandas.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three of the artificially-bred giant pandas have
survived and the rest died before they reached six months old.
</P>
<P>
The breeding base, located in the northern suburbs of Chengdu
and occupying an area of over 30 hectares, imitates the natural
habitat.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, two dozen pandas live at the breeding base,
which is the only research institute of giant panda reproduction
in China.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas normally get pregnant once a year and produce one
or two babies at each birth.
</P>
<P>
"The female giant pandas always show indifference and contempt
to the approaching male giant pandas during the mating season," a
researcher at the breeding centre said.
</P>
<P>
"So it's very difficult to have them make love and get pregnant
naturally," he said, adding that "only 10 percent of the giant
pandas are able to mate naturally."
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the breeding base are studying techniques of
enhancing the sexual desire and performance, improving the
survival rate of baby pandas, and artificial insemination,
according to researchers from the institute.

<HEADLINE> Manila's Exit From IMF Program Seen Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government may ask
for the postponement of the country's exit from the International
Monetary Fund's (IMF's) three-year extended fund facility (EFF)
program, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Singson, governor of the Central Bank of the
Philippines, admitted Wednesday that the government may be
compelled to do so due to the delay in the passage of the
remaining portion of the country's Comprehensive Tax Reform
Program.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the country's tax reform program is part of
the structural reforms pledged under the IMF's three year EFF
program.
</P>
<P>
The IMF Executive Board is set to approve the country's
graduation from the EFF program before the program's expiration by
June 23 this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the Philippine Congress up to now has yet to pass the
remaining portion of the tax package. Congress goes on recess on
June 5 and will resume sessions in July, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But Singson did not say whether the government would
renegotiate a new deadline to complete the tax reform program.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Singson has raised the possibility that the
country may extend the program by another six months if the tax
reform would not be completed by the time of the scheduled exit,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has been under the IMF's conditional lending
for 35 years under 23 loan programs. The current program under the
IMF's EFF, often dubbed the country's exit program, has been in
place since June 1994.
</P>
<P>
The EFF program provided the country some 474.5 million US
dollars in special drawing rights to support the economic and
financial program of the government.

<HEADLINE> Oriental Silk Festival Attracts 82 Million US Dollars In Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 82 million US dollars in
deals were contracted during the week-long festival, half of which
accounted for by pledged intention, at the Fifth Dandong Oriental
Silk Festival closed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The festival drew participants of more than 30 countries and
regions into this year's fair, according to today's "China
Daily".
</P>
<P>
The country's biggest border city in northeast China's Liaoning
province, Dandong is home to one quarter of silkworm production
worldwide and holds a 70 percent share of the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony to mark the construction of an industrial park was
also held at the fair between Dandong and Inchon city in Republic
of Korea (ROK).
</P>
<P>
Covering 448,000 square meters, the park is to be finished by
Inchon of ROK in the Dandong Border Economic Cooperation
Zone. With 5.4 million US dollars capital injected into the area,
the zone is expected to create more than 12,000 opportunities for
local employees.
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 workers are involved in the silk business,
which once held 40 percent of the city's total industry
output. Liu Tinyao, mayor of Dandong said that his "silk city" has
used overseas funds over the past several years to develop
electronics, auto parts, chemical fibres and paper-making, the
paper says.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Supports Creation of Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican Foreign Minister
Fernando Naranjo reiterated today his country's support for the
creation of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Naranjo said this at a press conference one day before former
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres is due to arrive in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica was the first country to open its embassy in
Jerusalem, against the orders of the United States, and has always
maintained particularly close relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Naranjo reaffirmed the good relations between the two countries
but said that his government supports the U.N. resolution that
agreed on the creation of an Israel state as well as a Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica's Foreign Ministry has also decided to grant aid to
Palestinian authorities and will send a medical delegation to
Palestinian territory in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
Naranjo stated that his country has no objection whatsoever to
the establishment of a Palestinian office here.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about the policy of Jewish settlements in
east Jerusalem," added the foreign minister, "because it
jeopardizes the peace process in the region."
</P>
<P>
"We have conveyed our concern to Israel but that does not mean
that we are no longer in good relations or that we are criticizing
them," he added.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (97-98) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (97-98) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Who has the power to interpret the Basic Law?
</P>
<P>
Answer: The power of interpretation of the Basic Law is vested
in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the NPC will authorize the courts of
the Hong Kong SAR to interpret on their own, in adjudicating
cases, the provisions of the Basic Law which are within the limits
of the autonomy of the region.
</P>
<P>
The courts of the Hong Kong SAR may also interpret other
provisions of the Basic Law in adjudicating cases.
</P>
<P>
However, if disputes should arise concerning interpretations of
the courts of the Hong Kong SAR, the power to render final
arbitration goes to the Standing Committee of the NPC.
</P>
<P>
If disputes should arise concerning provisions outside the
limits of the autonomy of the Hong Kong SAR, interpretations of
the Standing Committee of the NPC shall be final.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the NPC will consult its Committee
for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR before giving an
interpretation of the Basic Law provisions.
</P>
<P>
Question: What if existing Hong Kong laws contravene the Basic
Law?
</P>
<P>
Answer: The Basic Law is the fundamental legal code of the Hong
Kong SAR. Any existing local laws that contravene it will lose
their validity after July 1, 1997. Such laws may be amended in
accordance with procedures as prescribed by the Basic Law to make
them conform to the Basic Law.

<HEADLINE> Panama, US Try To Eliminate And Prevent Borer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A Panama-U.S. Commission has
met and decided to execute a program on eradication and prevention
of the borer insect on the Panamanian territory.
</P>
<P>
The objective of this commission is to protect livestock which,
in turn, benefits wildlife and the health of human beings, said
Michael Dunn, U.S. undersecretary of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The three-year program, administered by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, will
have an investment of 40 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Panama will contribute 15 percent of that amount and the United
States the remainder, said Carlos Sousa Lennox, Panama's
Agricultural Development Minister.
</P>
<P>
The program will create 200 jobs of which 60 percent will be
professionals and the rest administrative employees and operators,
he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Dunn, the eradication of the borer in the United
States has benefited cattle ranchers to the sum of about 500
million dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
In Mexico and Central America the eradication has helped to
save 341 million dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
The borer causes heavy losses every year in southern United
States because it affected cattle herds and wildlife.

<HEADLINE> Austria, Germany Agree on EU, NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Both Austria and Germany support an
enlargement of the European Union to take in east European
countries, Austrian President Thomas Klestil and visiting German
President Roman Herzog told reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
After holding talks on EU enlargement and the eastward
expansion plans of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),
the two presidents agreed that the 15-nation union should be
enlarged to include countries in eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Herzog, who arrived here earlier today for a three-day visit to
Austria, said that Germany and Austria should not be the EU's
eastern frontier forever. Both countries wanted the union to
expand eastward out of "selfishness" and the desire to unite east
European nations.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Austria would join NATO, Klestil said the question was
still under discussion. He said the government will consider its
position after the military alliance's summit in Madrid in July.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Herzog will also meet Austrian Federal
Chancellor Viktor Klima and Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schussel.

<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-one provinces in China
reported a total of 369 new HIV positive AIDS cases during the
first three months of this year, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
Quoting figures from the Ministry of Public Health, it

patients in the country to 6,359.
</P>
<P>
China is still among those nations with a low rate of HIV/AIDS,
says the report. Its occurrence, however, has expanded rapidly in
some parts of the country, and its rampant incidence in some
neighboring countries poses a threat to China, Vice-Minister of
public Health Yin Dakui said at the opening session of a National
Symposium on AIDS Control yesterday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The report quotes Yin as saying that China will establish a
National Center for AIDS Control to provide technical guidance for
the work, as well as a national laboratory base to do research
work on HIV/AIDS control and treatment.
</P>
<P>
He added the country has completed work in fields such as
publicity and education, expanding surveillance and the testing of
blood products.
</P>
<P>
China's central government has promulgated several regulations
focusing on HIV/AIDS control. The ministry has established 60
surveillance spots as bases for research. The Chinese Academy of
Preventive Medicine, in cooperation with the Yunnan Anti-Epidemic
Station, has successfully separated the major strain of virus from
HIV carriers in Yunnan province and is working on a
second-generation vaccine.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Research Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine
has developed seven groups of herbal medicines to treat HIV/AIDS.

<HEADLINE> US Says NATO-Russia Accord Not to Limit NATO's Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The document that the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Russia will sign in Paris
next week will not limit the alliance's freedom of action, a
senior U.S. official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters about President Bill Clinton's trip to
Europe next week, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said
that the so-called NATO-Russia Founding Act would not tie the
alliance's hands when involving in any conflicts.
</P>
<P>
According to the Founding Act, NATO and Russia will form a
permanent joint council that will make decisions on the basis of
consensus.
</P>
<P>
"The absence of a consensus in the NATO-Russia joint council
does not in any way affect the freedom of action, the freedom of
decision, either of NATO and ... or of Russia," Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Council, NATO's policy-making body, "stands
on its own and will continue to stand its own," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sandy Berger, the national security advisor, also briefed
reporters and said that if NATO's decision could be vetoed by
Russia, it would be proceeding with its eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Talbott indicated that the pledges that NATO made
on the deployment of nuclear weapons and substantial troops in the
new member states are "reassertions of NATO's own policy" and not
"negotiated limits on NATO's freedom of action."
</P>
<P>
"The alliance reserves the unilateral right to reassess the
security environment at any time, and if it felt there was a new
challenge, to change deployments accordingly," he added.
</P>
<P>
NATO promised Russia, which strongly opposes to the military
bloc's enlargement, that it would not deploy nuclear arms nor
substantial combat forces on the territories of the new member
countries after the alliance expands into the Eastern and Central
Europe.

<HEADLINE> More Gold Going To Market This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China mined 9.9 tons of gold last
month, bringing combined production in the first four months of
the year to 35 tons, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The production represents 35 percent of the full output planned
for 1997 and an increase of 20 percent over the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The paper quotes an official from the production division of
the Gold Bureau under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry as
saying that gold production will surpass its goal of 100 tons set
by the central government.
</P>
<P>
China decided to reduce the purchase price of gold by 5 percent
to six percent early this year in an effort to better integrate
the domestic gold price with the international price.
</P>
<P>
The price was reduced to just over 10.84 US dollars per gram
from 11.45 US dollars per gram. The current price is approximately
equivalent to 375 US dollars per ounce.
</P>
<P>
China will invest 120 million US dollars in the construction of
new facilities to mine and process an additional 3.75 tons of gold
in 1997, officials from the bureau said early this year.
</P>
<P>
Another 72.3 million US dollars will be used for technical
renovations which will help increase annual capacity by another
3.5 tons.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Poland Formally Bury Historical Feud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and
his visiting Polish counterpart Alexander Kwasniewski signed a
joint communique here on Wednesday, officially ending historical
feud between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the signing ceremony, Kuchma said
the unhappy past would never cast shadow on the Ukrainian and
Polish peoples at present as well as in the future.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique, entitled "Toward Harmony and Unity," would
turn over the dark pages of the Ukrainian-Polish relations, Kuchma
added.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine was occupied by Poland between 14th-16th century before
it integrated with Russia at the end of the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine formed its first republic when it declared independence
in 1918 from the Austrian-Hungarian Empire after World War
I. Eight months later, however, the Ukrainian National Republic
was overthrown by its Polish minorities who were backed by Poland.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two countries began to warm up after
Ukraine became independent from the former Soviet Union in
1991. Poland was the first to recognize its independence. Now, the
two countries hope to join hands in a bid to have a louder voice
on European affairs.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski, who arrived in Kiev accompanied by 60 businessmen
on Tuesday for a three-day visit, will also hold talks with
Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko, parliamentary speaker
Alexandre Moroz to discuss economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Five agreements are expected to be signed on cooperation in
health, finance, culture, science and education.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 Polish companies are operational in Ukraine, and the
trade between the two countries totalled over one billion
U.S. dollars in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguans to Be Evacuated due to Volcano Eruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A state of alert was declared today
in this northwestern state of Nicaragua because of the eruption of
the San Cristobal volcano and thousands of people there have begun
to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
The 1,745-meter high volcano, which is the highest and most
dangerous one in Nicaragua, began to spew ashes and gravel on May
19 over the city of Chinandega located 15 kilometers west of the
volcano.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,000 people who live on the skirts of the volcano will
have to be evacuated because of the increase of the volcanic
activity.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies (INETER) is
following the volcanic activity closely and has sent three groups
of geologists and volcanologists to San Cristobal to evaluate the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Experts did not rule out the eruption of lava. Late Tuesday
afternoon, a mushroom of white smoke covered the state municipal
hall and loud explosions inside the crater could be heard.
</P>
<P>
INETER Director Luis Munoz Valdes said that apart from the
evacuation of people who live in the hamlets close to the volcano,
security measures will also be taken for the nearly 118,000
Chinandega residents.
</P>
<P>
According to the institute, the first record of an eruption of
the volcano occurred in 1883. Since then, there have been 12
major eruptions, the last one occurring in 1977.

<P>
BONN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Bettina Wiegmann, midfielder of German
women's national soccer team, was voted Germany's Footballer of
the Year in 1997 in Munich on Wednesday after beating 14 other
candidates.
</P>
<P>
Soccer legend Franz Beckenbauer, a member of the voting
committee, presented the Hermes Cup for the award to the
26-year-old.
</P>
<P>
However, Wiegmann complained that German media paid little
attention to women's soccer. "We never expect they will cover the
sport in an all-round way, but they should have more report on
it. Some newspapers even report nothing about the results of our
first division league," she said.
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer also advised the media, especially TV stations,
give more attention to women's soccer.
</P>
<P>
Wiegmann was the second footballer to win the award following
Martina Voss.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Take Measures Against Foreign Fishing Vessels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Government of Canada today
announced that it will take measures against foreign fishing
vessels traveling through Canadian waters, after suspending
discussions with the United States over settlement of the
long-standing dispute on Pacific salmon.
</P>
<P>
Department of Fisheries and Oceans enforcement staff have been
instructed to ensure that existing regulations -- which require
foreign vessels to contact Canadian authorities as they pass
through Canadian waters -- are enforced, according to a press
release issued today by the Canadian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Depending on the circumstances, vessels that violate the
regulations can be inspected, required to go to a Canadian port or
face arrest, said the news release, adding that U.S. vessels going
to and from the Alaskan fishery are subject to these regulations.
</P>
<P>
"we are deeply disappointed that the United States came to
these meetings lacking the authority to negotiate," said Foreign
Affairs Minister Lloyd Axwothy.
</P>
<P>
"Our stakeholders did their best to resolve key issues in
recent negotiations with U.S. stakeholders without success," said
Fisheries and Oceans Minister Fred Mifflin, adding "Their efforts
were frustrated by U.S. unwillingness to agree on fair sharing of
the resource.
</P>
<P>
Discussions between the chief negotiators on Pacific salmon,
Yves Fortier for Canada and Mary Beth West for the United States,
broke off in Seattle yesterday after the U.S. negotiator indicated
she did not have the authority to make compromises on Fraser River
sockeye. The chief negotiators had resumed negotiations May 20
after stakeholder talks ended inconclusively May 9.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Bosnian Parties Responsible For Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian parties should be
ultimately responsible for implementing the Dayton peace accords,
said U.S. president Bill Clinton in a letter published on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The letter was a reply to a Chicago-based Bosnian refugee
association about the U.S. stance on Bosnia and published by the
Sarajevan daily Oslobodjenje.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said in the letter that "The United States continues to
work in concert with others in the international community to
encourage the parties to fulfill their commitments under the
Dayton Peace Agreement and to build on the gains achieved since
December 1995".
</P>
<P>
He said that the mission of Nato-led Stablization Force (SFOR)
should be completed by June of next year and that conditions can be
established for maintaining stability and security without an
foreign military presence.
</P>
<P>
"It remains in the U.S. national interest to help bring peace
to Bosnia -- not only for humanitarian reasons, but to reduce the
threats to general security and stability in Europe," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Although the United States and its allies can provide the
opportunity for bringing about peace, "it is they who are
ultimately responsible for implementing the peace agreement",
Clinton added.

<HEADLINE> House Speaker Urges Building Drug-Free America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Newt Gingrich, the speaker of
the U.S. House of Representatives, on Wednesday, called on the
nation's mayors to contribute to building a drug-free America by
2001.
</P>
<P>
"We would be a different country" if that were to happen,
Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich also said television networks could afford to help by
donating air time.
</P>
<P>
"If you could eliminate the drug problem from most
neighborhoods and... from most schools, you've eliminated a very
high percentage of drug abuse, a very high percentage of spousal
abuse," Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich made his remarks at a meeting where a task force of
the U.S. Conference of Mayors, local police chiefs and prosecutors
presented Congress with their blueprint for combating the
nation's drug epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which reflects the government's anti-drug policy,
urges greater community involvement with youngsters. It also
prescribes increased prevention and treatment, coupled with strict
law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said the United States has the resources to "destroy
the drug culture" if it so desires, and should use them.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Announces 1998 Production Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Commercial Airplane Group
of the U.S. today announced production rate changes on a number of
its airplane models.
</P>
<P>
The rate changes, which take effect in 1998, will result in a
production rate of 43 airplanes per month by the second quarter of
that year.
</P>
<P>
Boeing, the world's No. 1 producer of commercial jets,
announced last December that the company's monthly production
would reach a record 40 airplanes by the fourth quarter of this
year. The previous record of 39.5 airplanes per month was reached
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The new production rates will be set as follows: By the second
quarter of 1998, production of the 737 will be 24 airplanes per
month. That number includes a combination of the Next-Generation
and current model 737s. In the second quarter of 1998, the 747
rate will increase from four airplanes per month to five. The 777
rate will go from seven airplanes per month to five beginning in
March 1998. Production of the 757 will increase from four to five
airplanes in the second quarter of 1998. Production of the 767 is
currently expected to remain at four airplanes per month
throughout 1998.
</P>
<P>
The company also has announced that in 1997 it is expected to
deliver approximately 340 airplanes of all models.
</P>
<P>
In its recently issued 20-year assessment of worldwide market,
Boeing forecast air passenger traffic growth of 4.9 percent a year
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
To meet that growth and replace aging aircraft, the report
noted that the world's airlines are expected to add about 16,160
airplanes to their fleets, worth more than 1.1 trillion U.S.
dollars, during that same time period.

<HEADLINE> Stocks on Wall Street Edge Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Technology shares on Wall Street
rose today, but blue-chip shares pulled back as interest rates
jumped in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 12.77 points to
7,290.69, recovering from a 64-point drop.
</P>
<P>
Advancers outnumbered decliners by more than a 5-to-4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaling 537.05
million shares much more than the 447.17 million in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 2.27 to 839.39, and
the NYSE's composite index fell 0.99 to 436.21. Both big-company
measures flirted with record highs in the morning before turning
lower.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 9.87 to 1,373.75, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.32 to 592.08.
</P>
<P>
Bonds fell after the Commerce Department reported that the U.S.
trade deficit narrowed dramatically in March to 8.5 billion U.S.
dollars as U.S. exports rose to a second consecutive monthly
record.
</P>
<P>
The surprisingly robust data spurred worries that economic
growth was even quicker in the first quarter than the 5.6 percent
rate recently reported. That advance in the gross domestic product
was the fastest in nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices fell today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury
bond rose to 6.98 percent.

<HEADLINE> European Shares up on Unchanged US Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe
recovered from Tuesday's losses and ended higher Wednesday as the
US central bank decided to leave US interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
British shares in London opened strongly today but came back
from session highs later in the day as Wall Street tempered its
early advance, with the FTSE 100 index up 34.5 points at 4,642.0.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the market was relieved at the US Federal
Reserve's decision not to raise US rates and weaker-than-expected
UK money supply data for April also boosted stock prices.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares, which had suffered heavy losses
Tuesday, today made the greatest advance and held on their early
gains in the wake of a decision to hold US interest rates, with
the DAX-30 index closed the session 52.66 points higher at
3,596.09.
</P>
<P>
Supported by the interest rates news from the US, the Paris
bourse had recovered all of its losses suffered on Tuesday and had
climbed to the 2,800-level once again earlier in the day before
drifting back amid profit-taking and ending up 35.24 points at
2,786.35.
</P>
<P>
Sentiment was expected to remain cautious ahead of Sunday's
vote in the parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>

34.5 points at 4,642.0. The Frankfurt DAX-30 index ended 52.66
points higher at 3,596.09. In Paris, the CAC-40 index finished

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Sovereignty of Watercourse State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A state had indisputable
sovereignty over the watercourse which flowed through its
territory, a Chinese representative said at the UN General
Assembly here today.
</P>
<P>
Explaining China's position on vote against the resolution to
which the Convention on Non-Navigational Uses of International
Watercourses was attached, China's representative Gao Feng pointed
out there were obvious drawbacks in the draft convention.
</P>
<P>
First, it failed to reflect general agreement among all
countries, and a number of states had major reservations regarding
its main provisions. Secondly, the text did not reflect the
principle of the territorial sovereignty of a watercourse state.
Such a state had indisputable sovereignty over a watercourse which
flowed through its territory.
</P>
<P>
There was also imbalance between the rights and obligations of
the upstream and downstream states, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China could not support provisions on the mandatory
settlement of disputes in the international convention on
watercourses, as the provisions went against the principles set
out in the United Nations Charter, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Government favored the settlement of all disputes
through peaceful negotiations, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly today adopted a resolution on the
37-article convention with 103 votes in favor, three against and
27 abstentions. Voting against were China, turkey and Burundi
while Argentina, Egypt, France, India, Pakistan were among those
abstaining.
</P>
<P>
The resolution asks UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan to open the
convention for signature. The convention will enter into force 90
days after it has been ratified by 35 signatories.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Rises on Trade Data and Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rose broadly
Wednesday after the government reported an unexpected shrinkage in
the monthly trade deficit and comments from a senior German
central banker who preferred a stable dollar.
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar settled at 114.18 yen, up from 113.04
yen Tuesday. The dollar cost 1.6946 marks, up from 1.6823. The
pound cost 1.6450 U.S. dollars, down from 1.6570 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The main force helping the dollar was the Commerce Department
report that the March trade deficit narrowed sharply to 8.5
billion U.S. dollars due largely to record export sales. Many
traders had been expecting the deficit to widen.
</P>
<P>
The report reduced fears that the dollar's recent strength has
made U.S. goods too expensive.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday:
1.4085 Swiss francs, up from 1.3905; 5.7075 French francs, up from
5.6675; 1,667.25 Italian lire, up from 1,656.00; 1.3672 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.3664.
