<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Manila Stocks Fall Again Due to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Stock Exchange
index today fell by 84.53 points, or 2.9 percent, to close at
2,860.45, the biggest drop in five months.
</P>
<P>
The all shares index also declined 27.48 points, or 2.5
percent, to 948.96 points. It was the biggest percentage decline
since the index was introduced last November, and also the second
time it has closed below 1,000 points since last December.
</P>
<P>
However, turnover rose to 11.38 billion shares worth 3.8
billion pesos (146 million U.S. dollars) compared to 5.9 billion
shares worth 1.62 billion pesos (62.2 million U.S. dollars) posted
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Trading in the exchange was suspended on Monday due to a power
failure in the building where the stock exchange holds its regular
trading. The power failure caused millions of pesos of losses to
the trading floor.
</P>
<P>
In fact, it has been the eighth time that the Stock Exchange
index, a basket of 30 companies, fell in the month. From April
3-9, the index dropped by a total of 200 points in seven
consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the plunge came amid rumors that certain real
estate companies were facing financial problems similar to those
in Thailand, where the financial system has been crippled by loan
defaults to the real estate industry.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Andrew Tan, chairman of Megaworld Properties and
Holdings Inc., attempted to quell speculation that his company
were in financial trouble because of mounting debt.
</P>
<P>
Besides Megaworld, share prices of some other big real estate
developers also suffered heavily with foreign investors adjusting
their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
Banks were also concerned about their loan exposure to the
property industry. In the month, share prices of Metropolitan Bank
and Trust Corporation and Philippine National Bank dropped
sharply.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that there are more than enough similarities
between Manila and Bangkok to spook investors. Both cities have
had a building boom. Like Bangkok, Manila has high interest rates,
some of the worst traffic in Asia and a growing trade deficit that
has hit 14 percent of gross national product.
</P>
<P>
These are all signs that the economy may be overheating, and an
overheated economy often has real estate crashes. However,
analysts said that "there is no cause for such an alarm" in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
They said the Philippine economy is far from being overheated.
It has just been strong enough to create a real estate bubble in
the recent two years, not like Thailand that has enjoyed torrid
economic growth for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
Significantly, real estate in the country still has strength in
places. Although it has a glut and a long pre-sale period to
finance construction, demand still exists in the low and medium
sectors of the residential market, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, banks in the country are also taking measures to
limit their exposure to the property market, analysts said. For
example, the Philippine Commercial International Bank, one of the
largest banks, has lowered its loan ratio to the real estate
industry.
</P>
<P>
After examining commercial banks' real estate loans, the
Central Bank is also looking into the rapid growth of their
foreign currency loans to see if it is posing any danger to the
country's financial system, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Santer Accused of Interfering in British Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President
Jacques Santer, who attacked British Eurosceptics, has been
accused by Britain's main political party leaders of interfering
in the British general election.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered in Amsterdam Monday, Santer called those
Eurosceptics as "doom merchants" who did not know what they were
taking about.
</P>
<P>
"Do those doom merchants want us to step backwards towards a
Europe only composed of simple trading arrangements?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major, whose Conservative Party is
lagging behind the main opposition Labor Party in the run-up to
the May 1 general election, snatched Santer's controversial speech
as further evidence of the threat of further European integration.
</P>
<P>
"The speech absolutely reinforces the fears I raised a few days
ago. I will keep my feet on the brakes of further European
intergration and he (Labor leader Tony Blair) would put his foot
on the accelerator to a federal Europe," Major told a press
conference today.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party, which is commonly considered as more
pro-European, also distanced itself from Santer by announcing in a
statement that "the British people are perfectly capable of making
up their own minds without intervention from outside."
</P>
<P>
Blair told reporters today, "What Mr Santer says, with all due
respect, is neither here nor there. I disagree with a lot of what
he said."
</P>
<P>
Seeing his speech becoming a hot issue in the British general
election, Santer is quick to make a statement today saying that he
had no intention of interfering in the British election.
</P>
<P>
"We regret that it has become a party political and electoral
issue. It is not our intention to interfere in national elections
or campaigns," Santer's spokesman was quoted by reports from
Brussels as saying today.

<HEADLINE> China's New Policy, Uruguay Accord to Boost World Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- China's new trade policy and the
1993 Uruguay Round accord to lower import tariffs are expected to
boost world trade by 7.8 percent, a research group said here today.
</P>
<P>
The group, of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, said China's
policy of lowering its tariffs from the current 23 percent to 15
percent by the year 2,000 will drive up world trade by 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The policy was pledged by Chinese officials at the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum held in Manila last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the group said, the Uruguay Round accord on
cutting tariffs and lifting import restrictions by participating
countries is likely to expand global trade by 7.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The group said it will call for the Japanese government's
support to China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO)
to help China's implementation of the new trade policy.

<HEADLINE> Key Projects for China's Power Industry in 1996-2000 Period </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The power industry of China will
focus on four key projects in the years through 2010, according to
the World Energy Council Asia-Pacific Forum which opened here
today.
</P>
<P>
As part of the work:
</P>
<P>
-- The country is to build a trans-regional power
interconnection network, which includes the Three Gorges
Transmission Lines Project, centered on the Three Gorges
Hydropower Station and accompanied by the development of large
scale hydropower and thermal power bases. The regional power
network will be interconnected to transmit electricity to the long
distance load center.
</P>
<P>
-- Construction of the rural power network will be
accelerated. By 2000, electricity will extend to all counties,
bringing access to the 70 million people in rural counties who
formerly had no power supply. As a result, 95 percent of the rural
households and 1,000 counties will have electricity.
</P>
<P>
-- Energy conservation will be achieved through technical
innovation. In the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), the
industry will replace eight outdated gw generating units with 12
gw generating units. The retrofits for power grids in urban and
rural areas shall be completed more quickly in order to reduce the
wire loss to 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
-- More clean coal generation projects will be built. The
industry will actively research and establish the IGCC
demonstration power plants, and the PFBC pilot power plants with
100 mw level and large capacity CFBC boilers. Universal
environmental protection technology such as desulphurization will
be widely applied. The capacity of generating units equipped with
desulphurization facilities will be increased to 10-12 gw, and the
industrial wastewater will not be discharged until it is up to the
standard.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 2000, the total installed generating capacity
will amount to 290 gw. The newly-increased capacity in five years
will reach 80 gw with the average annual growth of 16 gw. The
electricity generation will reach 1,400 twh, with the average
growth at seven percent.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, the thermal power generation will still take the
leading position, covering 70 percent of the total installed
capacity. The hydropower capacity will reach 115 gw, slightly more
than that in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power capacity will reach 20 gw, which will temporarily
alleviate the pressure on coal transportation and environmental
protection in coastal areas. Renewable energy will have a total
capacity of 2.5 gw.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Jiang's Russia Trip to Greatly Impact World Situation by Xinhua Correspondent Yang Guojun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The four-day state visit to
Russia by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, which started today, will
not only mark a new stage in the Sino-Russian relationship on a
healthy track, but also have a far-reaching impact on the world's
multi-polarization and on the establishment of a new international
political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's current visit is the fourth summit between Chinese and
Russian leaders, and each of the previous three meetings since
1992 have pushed the Sino-Russian relationship to new heights.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the bilateral political relationship has
developed soundly and the economic and trade ties have progressed
rapidly. The cooperation between the two neighbors is continuing
to expand while the shared border areas are calm.
</P>
<P>
In December 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin visited China
for the first time, and both leaders then signed the "Joint
Communique on the Basis of Sino-Russian Relationship." This
brought the bilateral normal ties to a new level of "mutually
regarding each other as a friendly state."
</P>
<P>
In September 1994, Jiang visited Moscow and both sides once
again signed a joint communique announcing the two states would
establish and promote a "constructive partnership oriented to the
21st century."
</P>
<P>
In April 1996, Yeltsin came to China for the second time, and
both sides signed the third joint communique declaring that the
two countries would develop a strategic partnership of equality
and trust extending beyond the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The current fourth summit is meant to create a new type of
state relationship of "forming into partners, forging a good
neighborhood relationship, equality and mutual trust, mutually
beneficial cooperation and common development."
</P>
<P>
And this new relationship, characterized by "non-alignment,
non-confrontation, targeting at no third parties, mutual equality
and respect, multi-level and multi-faceted cooperation," is
aligned with the trend and requirement of the post-Cold War world
situation. It is also in the fundamental interests of the two
countries and conducive to world peace, stability and development.
</P>
<P>
The new relationship between China and Russia will be a
contribution to the establishment of the world's new political and
economic order. It is also a major practice in this regard, senior
diplomats here have said.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day visit, the two leaders are expected to sign
the fourth joint statement which is believed to focus on world
multi-polarization and on establishment of a new international
order. An agreement on reduction of armed forces on the border
areas between China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Tadzhikistan and
Kirghizstan will also be signed.
</P>
<P>
The fourth statement will explain the shared viewpoints of the
two countries on changes of the post-Cold War world situation and
the international relations.
</P>
<P>
Senior diplomats here claim it is the trend of the times to
establish a new international political and economic order marked
by "peace, stability, fairness and justice" for world peace and
the global development cause.
</P>
<P>
The Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence and the commonly
acknowledged international laws have become the basis for
establishing a new international order, and differences in social
systems, ideology and values should by no means be used as excuses
for interfering into other countries' internal affairs, or for
power politics or hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
International security is one of the major concerns of the
current international community. In April 1996, China, Russia,
Kazakhstan, Tadzhikistan and Kirghizstan signed in Shanghai an
agreement on strengthening military trust at the border areas.
</P>
<P>
The agreement to be signed in Moscow on the reduction of armed
forces on the border areas will make new room for thought for
developing a new global order, and also help create a new format
for the post-Cold War world security and stability, which is
totally different from the Cold War thinking.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here stress that following the signing of the fourth
joint statement and the military reduction agreements, the
strategic partnership between China and Russia will be further
enriched, and will lead people to re-think the relationship
between big countries in the world multi-polarization
process.

and 1.83 billion yuan in profit. By the end of 1996, their total
assets reached 33.3 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the bank had lent 2.55 billion yuan in
loans to the three companies.

SANAA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
said here today that the upcoming parliamentary elections will be
free and democratic under international supervision despite a
planned boycott by the Opposition.
</P>
<P>
The president made the statement when meeting a team of
international observers who had come to Yemen to supervise the
parliamentary elections, due to take place on April 27.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Urged to Help Rescue Children in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) today appealed to African leaders to use their influence
with Zairian rebel forces to ensure the care and protection of
refugee children and the immediate evacuation of the most
vulnerable unaccompanied children.
</P>
<P>
In a strong call for action issued here today, UNICEF Executive
Director Ms Carol Bellamy urged South African President Nelson
Mandela in particular to intercede directly with Laurent Kabila,
head of the Zairian rebel forces, the Alliance of Democratic
Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"As the world watches and waits, hundreds of children are at
death's door," she said. "But food and medicine are close at hand.
These innocent children can be saved."
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has deplored recent attacks on
refugees and humanitarian workers in eastern Zaire and urged all
the parties to stop the fighting and allow the unimpeded delivery
of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population caught in
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
"I pay tribute to the courage of all the aid workers who, in
spite of extremely difficult conditions, are doing their utmost to
deliver assistance to the population in need," the
secretary-general said in a statement issued here Monday. "I hope
repatriation and air-bridge operations will start very soon to
save the lives of the vulnerable women and children needing better
care."
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
called on the Kisangani authorities in eastern Zaire to take
urgent action to airlift Rwandan refugees home, saying that each
day's delay would lead to more deaths.
</P>
<P>
Since Friday, violence and looting have prevented relief
workers from conducting emergency programs for more than 100,000
malnourished and desperate refugees in the area and for
neighboring villages. "A series of security incidents, including
the looting of foodstocks, have blocked our access to the camps.
Today the military told us that we would not be allowed in the
camps because of a security operation in the area," High
Commissioner Ms Sadako Ogata said in a statement Monday.

<HEADLINE> Algerian Terrorists Massacre 93 Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Ninety-three Algerians were
massacred from Monday night to early this morning in a small
village near the the Algerian capital Algiers by a group of
Islamic extremists, the Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted Algerian
security forces as saying today.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that this is the biggest massacre of civilians by
Islamists ever made known by the Algerian government since
violence began ravaging the country in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The massacre took place in the village of Haouch Boughfi el
Khemisti, which is near Bougara and 25 kilometers south of
Algiers. The village is located on the plain of Mitidja, where the
militant Armed Islamic Group (GIA) is very active.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two civilians, most of them women, were massacred last
week by Islamists on the same plain. Four women abducted by the
Islamists were later found raped and killed.
</P>
<P>
The latest massacre brought to 300 the number of civilians
killed in the regions of Blida and Medea south of Algiers since
April 3, said AFP quoting partial estimations.
</P>
<P>
Since November 1996, hundreds of villagers have been
slaughtered in Blida and Medea by Islamists who resorted to a way
of terror and atrocity in their killings -- cutting throats,
mutilating bodies, chopping off heads and slaughtering pregnant
women and their babies, sometimes with seesaws.
</P>
<P>
The GIA has claimed responsibility for several of the killings
in their underground publications.
</P>
<P>
The United States State Department said that 60,000 people have
been killed since 1992, after the Algerian army deprived the now
outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) party of a parliamentary
election victory.
</P>
<P>
Algeria will organize its legislative elections on June 5,
which will be participated in by most of the country's political
parties.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Implementation of International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) and the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) will jointly organize a seminar on the implementation of
international humanitarian law here on April 29-30.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Zidane Meriboute, Head of the ICRC
mission to the OAU, at a press briefing here today.
</P>
<P>
Meriboute said African ambassadors accredited to the OAU,
ambassadors from the members of the UN Security Council and the
Council of Europe will attend the two-day seminar.
</P>
<P>
Meriboute said the seminar will be lectured by Judge Richard
Goldstone, former Chief Prosecutor of Ttribunal Ex-Yugoslavia and
Arusha; Kama, President of the International Criminal Tribunal
for Rwanda; Ahmed Mahiou, President of the UN International Law
Commission; and Toni Pfanner, Head of the Lagal Division of the
ICRC.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is the fourth one jointly organized by the OAU and
the ICRC.
</P>
<P>
According to the ICRC, the International Humanitarian Law,
also called the law of war, sets out detailed rules which seek to
limit the effect of armed conflict. In particular, it protects
those who are not, or are no longer, taking part in the fighting,
and sets limits on the means and methods of warfare. enditem

<HEADLINE> Obscure Farmers Elected Village Chief by Self-Recommendation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- In a classroom of his village's
school, farmer Chen Huiting gave the first campaign speech of his
life.
</P>
<P>
Chen lives in Nanyuze, in Tunliu County of north China's Shanxi
Province. In this year's election of his village committee, the
village leadership, he recommended himself for candidacy and was
ultimately chosen as the group's director, or village chief.
</P>
<P>
Under Chinese law, candidates for the villagers' committees are
mainly nominated by the village branch of the Communist Party of
China, the villagers' electoral groups, or more than 10 villagers.
</P>
<P>
Self-recommendation is a new nomination practice that has
emerged in recent years. Eleven of the 18 candidates for the
villagers' committee in Nanyuze named themselves for consideration
as candidates.
</P>
<P>
"Self-recommendation has given obscure ordinary farmers the
chance to enter village leadership," said an official with the
local civil affairs department, which oversaw the election.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, China initiated direct elections for the villagers'
committees, held once every three years.
</P>
<P>
In the past election, candidates were mostly people who had
been village cadres before or enjoyed the respect of the villagers.
</P>
<P>
In the new round of elections that began in 1996, many villages
gave each eligible voter the right of self-nomination, as long as
he or she could obtain the signed support of at least 10 fellow
villagers.
</P>
<P>
This has helped a number of ordinary farmers, who are not
members of the Communist Party and never served as village cadres,
to become strong competitors for membership in the villagers'
committee.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Has No Plan to Evacuate Staff from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has no plan to
evacuate its staff from the war-torn Zaire, Deputy Foreign
Minister Aziz Pahad said in Cape Town today.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to media reports that South Africans were being evacuated
from Zaire, Pahad told the National Assembly Foreign Affairs Committee
"we have no plan to evacuate our staff. They will remain."
</P>
<P>
According to foreign affairs spokesman Peter Swanepoel, South
Africa's five diplomats, including Ambassador Jan Van Deventer,
were continuing to do important work in Zaire in line with South
African and United Nations mediation efforts.
</P>
<P>
However, Swanepoel said there were contingency plans for an
evacuation "if things go wrong". He could not confirm reports
that the South African air force had planes on eight-hour
stand-by to airlift citizens if necessary.
</P>
<P>
About 50 South Africans were known to be in Zaire one month ago,
and South African embassy officials were in contact with them,
Swanepoel said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Zairean reble forces led by Laurent Kabila
were preparing for the final offensive on Kinshasa, the capital of
Zaire, to seize power from ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko who has
ruled the country for 32 years. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
"We farmers were used to accepting anyone appointed as village
cadres by governments at higher level," said a Nanyuze villager.
"Now things are different. If you want to work for the people, you
must first let them know you."
</P>
<P>
Before the preliminary election that decided formal candidates,
each of the 18 candidates of Nanyuze gave a campaign speech to the
villagers' delegates in the village school.
</P>
<P>
They must answer three questions: Why do you want to become a
village cadre? What do you plan to do for the village if you are
elected? What will happen if you lose the election?
</P>
<P>
All the speeches were recorded, then broadcast to the entire
village for two days.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who is self-employed as a tractor driver, clinched the
final election for village chief with a successful speech, beating
out his rival, who was nominated by the village Party branch, by a
slim margin.
</P>
<P>
"The election was just like a fair examination," Chen
said. "The new nomination method of self-recommendation enabled me
to join it."
</P>
<P>
Cui Kexue, another self-recommended candidate, was not as
lucky: he received only one vote of support in the preliminary
election.
</P>
<P>
"I failed because most villagers didn't understand me," Cui
said. "The election speeches should be made on the streets,
instead of in a classroom."
</P>
<P>
Guo Xiaoping, vice director of the Shanxi Provincial Department
of Civil Affairs, said that no matter which method of nomination
is adopted, only those candidates whom the people are willing to
choose could win the election.
</P>
<P>
"An open and fair village election will help maintain the
stability of the rural political power at the grassroots level,"
he noted.

NEW DELHI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- I.K. Gujral, who was sworn in
as India's 12th prime minister Monday, won a vote of confidence
this evening in the Lower House after more than 10 hours of
debate.
</P>
<P>
The vote of confidence was passed by a voice vote.
</P>
<P>
Indian President S.D. Sharma appointed Gujral as prime minister
on April 20 and asked him to prove his majority in the Lower House

elected leader of the 13-party United Front to replace Deve Gowda,
who was disliked by the Congress party, supporter of the United
Front.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party criticized the Gowda government for its
failure to contain the "communal forces" and strengthen "secular
forces" in the past 10 months and insisted that the United Front
should change its leader so as to get back support of the Congress
party, which withdrew its support to the Gowda government on March
30.
</P>
<P>
Gujral today promised to seek consensus in solving all problems
in the country and to try his best to deepen and widen the
economic reform process.

<HEADLINE> Russian Newspapers Welcome Jiang's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Major Russian newspapers have
greeted Chinese President Jiang Zemin's arrival here today with
reports and articles welcoming his state visit.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's visit, scheduled to last five days, is an important
event, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Grigori Karasin was quoted
as saying by a report in today's daily Komsomol Pravda.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has long given a priority to the relations with China,
and this has nothing to do with developments in Europe, such as
NATO's proposed eastward expansion," Karasin said.
</P>
<P>
On border issues, he said Russia will honor its promise by
working with China to finish the demarcation of the eastern
section of the Sino-Russia common border within this year.
</P>
<P>
It is an undertaking in the interest of both countries and with
strategic importance, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russia's ambassador to China Igor Alexeyevich
Rogachev said in an interview with the daily Trud that "Moscow and
Beijing both favor dialogues at the highest level."
</P>
<P>
Jiang's visit is "of particular significance not only for
bilateral ties, but also for the peace and stability of
the Asia-Pacific region and the entire world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rogachev also paid great tribute to a document to be signed
during Jiang's visit, saying it "will make the 7,500-kilometer
common border a belt of peace and stability in Asia."

<HEADLINE> WEC Forum on New Energy Technology Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Several hundred officials and
energy experts from around the world attended today's opening
ceremony in Beijing of the World Energy Council (WEC) Asia Pacific
Regional Forum, to discuss new energy technology for the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Participants from 25 countries and regions were at the event,
held at the Shangri-la Hotel.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the meeting is to study new policies on energy
development in the Asia-Pacific region and promote regional
cooperation in energy utilization and development.
</P>
<P>
The forum will convene five panel discussions, covering
potential cooperative projects in the fields of coal, electricity,
oil and gas, renewable energy and fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
In his speach at today's event, Ye Qing, vice minister of the
State Planning Commission, welcomed energy specialists from all
over the world to the Chinese capital to talk about major energy
issues.
</P>
<P>
Development of new energy is conducive to economic development
and serves as a guarantee for a sustained development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Toyoaki Ikuta, president of the WEC Asia Pacific Regional
Forum, said in a speech that in Asia, East Asia in particular, a
rapid increase in energy demand is expected to occur as a result
of substantial economic growth.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, energy production is unable to meet
this precipitous growth demand. Therefore, the dependence on
energy imports, especially on oil from the Middle East, will
increase.
</P>
<P>
Taking proper action to ensure energy security is of vital
importance in solving energy and environmental issues, not only in
this region but for the entire world, he said, adding that this
may well be a major challenge early in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that all those present will be able to do
more to solve the energy issue in this region by specifically
detailing problems and distributing all information to the member
nations for discussion.
</P>
<P>
The WEC was founded in 1923 and has over the years become the
world's leading non-governmental energy policy forum whose
objective is to promote the sustainable supply and use of energy
for the greatest benefit of all. It has member committees in 100
countries.

<HEADLINE> France Calls for Transitional Government in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- France today called for the
establishment of a transitional government in Zaire to "mark the
start of national reconciliation" and prepare for general
elections.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of a government of transition should mark
the start of national reconciliation. Its essential task will be
the implementation as rapid as possible of the indispensable
electoral process," said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques
Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
France made the appeal after Michel Dupuch, advisor on African
affairs of President Jacques Chirac, met with South African
President Nelson Mandela in the Cape Town last Saturday on the
situation in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the mission of Dupuch is to "expose
directly to President Mandela our analysis and our worries" about
the situation in Zaire and to tell him France's support for his
efforts to arrange a meeting between Zairian President Mobutu Sese
Seko and Zairian rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"What counts is that a meeting between President Mobutu and
Kabila takes place as soon as possible," said Rummelhardt. "The
will of negotiation should be expressed clearly and rapidly, which
is not always the case if one judges by certain public
declarations (of Kabila)."
</P>
<P>
He said that "the search for a negotiated solution is the only
way out for the present crisis" and that all other ways, including
military conquest, "will increase the sufferings of the people and
worsen the humanitarian situation."
</P>
<P>
"Zaire has nothing to win in the pursuit of fruitless
confrontations. To go out of this crisis, they should engage in
dialogue and fix together the conditions of an orderly
transition," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He also said that France does not wish to see an intervention
by foreign troops into Zaire to protect the foreign expatriates in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,000 Western troops, most of them Americans, are now
stationed in Congo or near the coast of Zaire, assumably for a
possible evacuation operation of Westerners from Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"We really wish that these troops will not intervene, which
means that the security of properties and persons will not be
threatened (first)," he said.

<HEADLINE> Irish Businessman Admits Giving Former PM Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Irish businessman Ben Dunne told
an official tribunal on payments to politicians in Dublin today
that he personally gave former Irish Prime Minister Charles
Haughey 200,000 pounds (about 320,000 U.S. dollars), said reports
from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Dunne told the tribunal that he gave Haughey, who had been
Irish prime minister between 1979 and 1992, the money in the form
of three bank drafts of about 70,000 pounds (about 112,000
dollars) each in 1991.
</P>
<P>
But he made it clear that he never expected "any favor or
benefit" from Haughey, one of the most powerful figures in Irish
politics for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
Dunne, former head of the Irish Dunne's department store chain,
said that he understood that Haughey owed about 1 million pounds
(about 1.6 million dollars) and he gave him the money to help ease
the debts.
</P>
<P>
Dennis McCulough, counsel for the tribunal, said Monday that
Dunne handed over from 1987 to 1991 a total of 1.3 million pounds
(about 2 million dollars) to Haughey, who has denied receiving any
money in a letter to the judge overseeing the hearing.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal is expected to last for at least a few weeks.

ATHENS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Greek police today arrested a
large number of Albanians and Iraqis for illegally entering the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) today,
a total of 209 illegal immigrants from Albania have been arrested

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Helicopters fly No-fly Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi helicopters, bringing back
pilgrims home from mecca, entered the no-fly zone in the south and
landed safely this morning at the Iraqi-Saudi border area of
Ar'ar, about 350 kilometers southwest of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iraqi news agency INA, Iraqi government sent
at least seven military helicopters Tuesday to pick up Iraqi pilgrims
who went to mecca by air to perform Hajj earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The helicopters took off from Al-Taji military base on the
northern outskirts of the capital city Baghdad and dozens of Iraqi
and foreign journalists were invited on board.
</P>
<P>
This move was made in defiance of the air-traffic ban imposed
on Iraq in 1991 by the allied forces after the Gulf war. According
to the report, despite the U.S. warnings, the Iraqi helicopters
entered the no-fly zone patrolled by the U.S. air force.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi government spokesman Monday warned the U.S. that any
hostile action could threaten the safety of Iraqi pilgrims, and be
faced with "appropriate reaction" from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman also said it is Iraq's legitimate right to
use its civilian aircraft to fly home the Iraqi pilgrims from
Mecca.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. in turn has warned that Iraq would face unspecified
retaliation for the action. A White House spokesman stated Monday
that his country will not shot down the Iraqi helicopters, adding
that the U.S. "would respond appropriately."
</P>
<P>
On April 9, defying the air embargo, an Iraqi passenger plane
flew 104 elderly and sick Muslims to Saudi Arabia for Hajj, one of
five essential obligations of Islam for its believers. The plane
flew to Saudi Arabia via Jordan to avoid the no-fly zone in
southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. insisted that the flight violated U.N. resolutions,
but it failed to press the UN Security Council to pass a
statement to condemn Iraq for the flight.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi government said earlier that relevant UN resolutions,
namely 661 and 670 have not banned the use by Iraq of its
airplanes outside its borders.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also said it strongly rejects any new interpretation
of UN resolutions 661 and 670 as well as other resolutions.
it will preserve the right to use its airliners.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had appealed to UN Security Council several times this
year to allow it to fly Iraqi pilgrims to Mecca, but the request
was rejected.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Calls for Rescue of Children in E. Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Carol Bellamy, executive
director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), issued a
strong call for action today to help rescue children in Eastern
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy appealed to African leaders to use their influence with
the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of
Congo-Zaire to ensure the care and protection of refugee children
and the immediate evacuation of the most vulnerable unaccompanied
children.
</P>
<P>
For four days the threat of violence has prevented aid workers
from reaching the refugees who are scattered in camps between
Kisangani and Ubundu. Humanitarian aid has been looted, fuel for
aid flights has been taken, aid workers have been threatened and
local villagers have been massacred by parties unknown, according
to UN sources.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that if aid workers are not allowed access
to the refugees, hundreds of children and their families will die
of neglect," she said.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 unaccompanied children were to be airlifted
from Kisangani to Goma beginning last Friday. They were to be the
first group in an operation to evacuate 80,000 to 100,000 people
over the next three months. But local authorities delayed the
evacuation, first saying that there was a risk of spreading
cholera to other cities, and then arguing that the airlift would
congest the airports.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy urged the alliance to make the evacuation possible.
"Time is running out for innocent children caught in the
conflict," she stressed.

NAIROBI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
today called on Zairean rebels "to ensure a secure environment in
which aid can be safely delivered".
</P>
<P>
In a news flash issued here today, the WFP said that late
Tuesday afternoon, the entire load of relief food on a train en
route to the refugee camps was looted by Zairean villagers.
</P>
<P>
About 119 tons of relief food were stolen out of a total of
120 tons aboard the train during a violent overnight attack seven
kilometers from Kisangani, the third largest city of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
A further 72 tons of food were stolen overnight Sunday by the
local people from a WFP depot in Kasese Town, 25 kilometers south
of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
Catherine Bertini, WFP Executive Director, strongly deplored
the theft of some 200 tons of relief food from a WFP train and
depot in the Kisangani area.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we've been working flat out to feed people and
to save thousands of lives in these camps. This is a terrible
loss. Desperately hungry people are reliant on that very food
for their survival."
</P>
<P>
According to the news flash, the events have not only resulted
in a loss of more than 500,000 U.S. Dollars worth of food and
supplies, but have caused a total blockade of all aid assistance
to the camps in eastern Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Constroversial Egyptian-Israeli Project Needs More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The controversial and expensive
Midor oil refinery project, which brings together Egyptian and
Israeli private businessmen in partnership with the Egyptian
government, is seeking more international equity.
</P>
<P>
Repsol of Spain and Agip of Italy are interested in taking
shares in the big project, Egyptian Oil Minister Hamdy al-Banbi
told a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot predict how much shares (they will take) and when
the contract will be finalized because it is their chance, but I
welcome them to join (the project)," he said.
</P>
<P>
And if they fail to come up, shares will be offered to the
public to further the privatization process in the oil sector as
well, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
When plans for the refinery were first announced two years
ago, the project made headlines as an example of the new links
possible between Egyptian and Israeli businessmen as a result of
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In the original plan, the Swiss Merhav and Irish Midor, which
group some Israeli and Egyptian private businessmen, each had a 40
percent share holding in the one-billion-U.S.-dollar project.
</P>
<P>
But serious financial problems almost derailed it in January
until the oil ministry decided the state-owned Egyptian General
Petroleum Corp (EGPC) should move up its share from 20 percent to
60 percent and increase its capital investment from 200 million
to 600 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Merhav and Midor each hold 20 percent now.
</P>
<P>
Banbi said the contract is being finalized and discussions are
going on, but he set no deadline for the operation.
</P>
<P>
Turning to an even more controversial Israeli-Egyptian gas
network, the so-called Peace Pipeline, Banbi said the project is
"in a standstill," for "technical reasons."
</P>
<P>
Describing the project as an overblown case of propaganda,
Banbi said it is actually a "very small project," that has "little
economic repercussions."
</P>
<P>
Egypt does "not give it a big priority," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to make peace with Israel but
the bilateral ties have been cool because of the deteriorating
peace prospects in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> German Cabinet Approves Tax Reform Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The German cabinet today approved a
comprehensive tax reform plan which would produce a net annual tax
reduction of 30 billion marks, or 17.6 billion U.S. dollars, for
the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
The tax reform plan, proposed by Finance Minister Theo Waigel,
is believed to be the country's biggest tax-revision package since
1949. Aiming at bolstering business confidence, investment and
hiring, it has become the government's top domestic policy
priority and its main recipe to curb record high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
But the Bonn government still needs to strike a compromise on
the tax reform plan with the main opposition Social Democratic
Party (SPD) if the plan is to survive the upper house of the
German parliament, Bundesrat, where the SPD controls a majority.
</P>
<P>
Under the package, the government wants, among other things, to
cut income taxes to 15 percent for low-wage earners and 39 percent
for people with high incomes instead of the current marginal rates
ranging from 25.9 percent to 53 percent. Business revenue tax
would also be axed from 47 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
This would lead to a shortfall of 82 billion marks (48 billion
dollars) in state revenues, 38 billion (22 billion dollars) of
which would be recouped by eliminating tax loopholes and
write-offs, the government says.
</P>
<P>
Of the remaining 44 billion mark (26 billion dollar) shortfall
the government says it would recoup a further 14 billion marks
(8 billion dollars) by boosting consumption taxes, probably by
raising value added tax (VAT) by one percentage point to 16
percent.
</P>
<P>
This would leave the public with 30 billion marks in net annual
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
The SPD, however, has spoken in favor of keeping the top income
rate at 53 percent or trimming it only modestly, a strategy meant
to keep the tax burden on those best suited to pay.
</P>
<P>
It also accuses the government of playing down the financial
shortfall which would be induced by tax cuts.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA) today stressed the importance of
transforming Africa's agricultural sector into a state that is
productive and sustainable.
</P>
<P>
ECA Executive Secretary K. Y. Amoako made the remarks here
when he was opening a high level expert meeting jointly organized
by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the ECA on
capacity building for food security and sustainable agricultural
development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Amoako said the meeting was held "at a time of great concern
that many Africans still do not have economic access to
sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs
and food preferences for an active and healthy life."
</P>
<P>
It was held also "at a time of great promise for addressing
the food insecurity and sustainable agricultural development
problems of Africa," he added.
</P>
<P>
He told the participants to focus their deliberations on four
areas: market deregulation, agricultural sustainability, income
generation and diversification, and trade, cooperation and
integration.
</P>
<P>
According to the organizers of the meeting, the overall
objective of the four-day workshop is to lay out a "road map"
that will enable UNDP and ECA to help strengthen capacities for
planning and managing interventions in support of food security
and sustainable agricultural development at the national,
sub-regional, and regional levels in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from African countries, United Nations
agencies and international organizations attended the first day

<HEADLINE> West Urged to Be Neutral on Kenya's Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
today urged western donors to be neutral on Kenya's political
issues and asked them to write off some of the country's debts.
</P>
<P>
The president was speaking here today when he received 40
lorries donated by the Japanese government for transport of
relief supplies in the country.
</P>
<P>
He wondered why certain western countries who said they were
for democracy failed to condemn and even supported violence in
Africa, adding that some countries wished to push Kenya to the
brink of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader stressed that western countries did not
understand fully the root cause of problems affecting Africa.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that developed countries had social welfare
systems to look after their unemployed citizens while African
countries could not support such arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the constitutional changes in Kenya, he said that
his government's cautious approach to the problem was to
forestall upheavals inherent in careless amendments.
</P>
<P>
Moi noted that any meaningful change in Kenya's constitution
needed serious discussions because it affected all Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that any sudden change in the constitution
could cause chaos, jeopardize the process of democratization and
scare away investors.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Adjusts War Game Plan for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has adjusted the plan of
joint military exercises with Greece to make them less sensitive
for the sake of the ongoing proximity talks between the Greek and
Turkish communities, an official spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a cabinet meeting here, Government
Spokesman Manolis Christofides said Greek fighters will not fly
within Cyprus' air space during the proximity talks.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, however, stressed that this decision was not
taken under pressure but is a good-will gesture indicating the
government's determination to proceed with the ongoing proximity
talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"Following a proposal by President Glafcos Clerides and after
consultations between the governments of Greece and Cyprus, it
was said that part of a military exercise "Vergina", dealing
with the interception of hostile aircraft can also take place
outside Cyprus' air space," Christofides said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that maneuvers to counter an offensive by enemy
planes attacking land targets in Cyprus "is to be postponed at
present."
</P>
<P>
Christofides said the Cypriot army exercises "Toxotis" with
the participation of the Greek military, "will take place in
close proximity to Cyprus but not within its territorial
waters."
</P>
<P>
At the end of these exercises, and with the consent of the
Cypriot government, Greek navy vessels will visit Cyprus in an
official capacity, he added.
</P>
<P>
"President Clerides and Greek Premier Costas Simitis share
the belief that during the proximity talks, it would be good not
to have Greek fighter planes flying in Cyprus' air space,"
Christofides told the press.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece signed a joint defense pact in November
1993, which provides for joint military exercises between the
two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He said Foreign Minister Yiannakis Cassoulides has already
informed the U.N. and other interested countries about the
government's decision.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-led proximity talks, which began on March 10, were
conducted by the U.N. Resident Representative Gustave Feissel,
who had bi-weekly separate meetings with President Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The talks are aimed at paving the way for the U.N. proposed
face-to-face negotiations between leaders of the two communities
by the middle of this year, and getting the two sides to adopt
good-will gestures to create a positive climate for the direct
talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright (the then
U.S. ambassador to the U.N.) first proposed a ban on overflights
by Greek and Turkish aircraft over Cyprus last year, but the idea
was rejected by the Greek Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
This Eastern Mediterranean island has remained divided since
1974 when Turkish troops occupied the northern third in the wake
of an Athens-backed coup.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Build More Railways to Revive Silk Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government declared
here today that it plans to build two new railway lines to
connect the Indian subcontinent to the west, north and south via
Iran.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani
in his letter to the opening ceremony of the four-day Second
International Conference on the Silk Road, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that Iran has revived the Silk Road by
constructing long rail lines starting from the Gulf and stretching
to Sarakhs, a border town near Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president said that Iran is trying to attract the
attention of tourists to the Iranian Islamic civilization by
exerting efforts on the day-to-day development of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Silk Road, more than 7,000 kilometers in length, snakes
through nine key countries, including China, nations of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Ramos, representative of the World Tourism
Organization, said at the meeting that the WTO will fully support
the Silk Road project which started in China in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He said that the tourism organization will present a report on
the WTO's activities and a future program for promoting tourism
along the Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
Xue Fan, representative of the China National Tourism
Administration, said that the Silk Road project has attracted
more and more tourists from various countries of the world.
</P>
<P>
She said that China has accommodated many tourists groups.
However, the transportation still remains a headache for further
development, she added.
</P>
<P>
Deborah Luhrman, press attache of the WTO, said that China has
contributed a lot to the tourism project of the Silk Road,
claiming that China, in fact, is what she called a teacher for
some CIS nations since it has had good infrastructure such as
hotels and tourist services.
</P>
<P>
She said that her organization is trying its best to
facilitate the Silks Road project by facilitating visa
procedures and updating information of airlines and hotels.
</P>
<P>
Luhrman said the objective for the meeting is to "bring
together all government officials in different countries,"
especially the nations along the Silk Road, to "explore ways" to
promote tourism along the Silk Road.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A secret force policeman was killed
and six others wounded during an exchange of fires with suspected
militants early this morning, said a source at the Interior
Ministry today.
</P>
<P>
The source noted that the police headed for the a village in
Samalout, Manya, 120 kilometers south of Cairo, after they were
tipped at around 02:00 local time (midnight GMT) that suspects in
the slaying of a Christian farmer were gathering there.
</P>

The two sides exchanged fires as the policemen try to arrest
the assailants, who were believed behind the killing of Istefanos
Zaki, a Coptic Christian farmer whose body was found Monday on his
wheat farm.
</P>
<P>
Minya security bodies rushed to the scene immediately after the
shooting and cordoned off the area to hunt for the culprits, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
While combing the area for the fugitives today, the security
forces also hit upon the body of another slain policeman in nearby
wheat plantations.
</P>
<P>
Coptic Christians, who constitute about 10 percent of Egypt's
63 million people, have been the targets of terrorist attacks of
Islamic militants who regard them as pagans.
</P>
<P>
Today's killing occurred only two days after another terrorist
attack, in which two police officers were killed and four others
wounded in the southern province of Assuit, 360 kilometers south
of Cairo.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jordan Maintains Ban on Imports of Cows from Some </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian Minister of
Agriculture Mijhim Khreishah today reiterated the ban on import of
live cows, meat and dairy products from any country where the
mad-cow disease appears.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian Minister made this statement during his meeting
with a specialized French delegation representing the Ministries
of Agriculture, Finance and Economy in France.
</P>
<P>
The French team is visiting Jordan to portray the facts
relating to the detection of cases of mad-cow disease which has
prompted Jordan to ban the import of cows and dairy products from
France.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian news agency (Petra) has quoted the Jordanian
Minister as saying that Jordan will under no circumstances allow
any such imports unless it is positively certain that the foreign
exporting country is free of that epidemic and its cows absolutely
safe.
</P>
<P>
The two sides exchanged views during the meeting about
technical topics and details related to the mad-cow disease, the
follow-up of cows' health conditions, and the kind of fodder and
food provided to cows.
</P>
<P>
On their part, the French delegation members pointed out that
only 18 cases of mad-cow disease have been reported in France
since 1991, whereas, the number of cows throughout France is
approximately 20 million.
</P>
<P>
The delegation asserted that all cows in the country are
subject to health control since their birth, that each cow has
certified birth and health certificates, and that export of cows
and related products will take place after ascertaining their safety.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian Minister promised to convey the French views to
the competent Jordanian authorities to study and to adopt the
necessary measures in this regard.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Serbs Harassed in Croat-Controlled Area: IPTF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Serbs continue being harassed in
Drvar, a western Bosnian area where they used to be the majority
and which is now controlled by Croats, the UN said today.
</P>
<P>
According to Alexander Ivanko, a spokesman for the UN
International Task Force (IPTF), A "very ugly incident" was
reported in Drvar Sunday, in which a house belonging to a Serb
female was set on fire.
</P>
<P>
When she tried to put out the fire, the suspects fire in the
air to frighten her, Ivanko said.
</P>
<P>
Although local police have reported the incident to the IPTF
and are currently investigating, it represented "the continued
policy of harassment of a small minority of Serbs still living in
the Drvar area," Ivanko said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the local Serbs fled their homes in late 1995 when the
Serb forces, which earlier had an upper hand, was routed by
Croatian troops.

<HEADLINE> S. African Official on Proposed Zairean Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Zairean rebel leader
Laurent Kabila has reiterated his commitment to the proposed
direct talks with Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko in South
Africa later this week, a South African senior official said
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee
in Cape Town, South African Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad
said the South African government is still awaiting the official
confirmation from Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
Pahad was apparently referring to President Nelson Mandela's
formal invitation to Mobutu, delivered by Mobutu's special envoy
Honore Nganda last Thursday, to meet Kabila in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Although Mobutu has since indicated publicly that he would
agree to "talks in principle", he has yet to formally reply to
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
"When we get an official response, we will inform everybody
what the real truth is," said Pahad.
</P>
<P>
Statements by Mobutu's son and spokesman Nzanga Mobutu
indicated that his 66-year-old ailing father was not willing to
meet his foe in South Africa because of his ill health, and was
proposing another venue for the talks.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not clear whether the rebels would accept a new
venue for the first face-to-face talks between Mobutu and Kabila
since the breakout of the civil war in October last year.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Seeks Foreign Investments in Expanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is seeking more
international investments on expansion of the current living
areas, Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el Ganzouri said here today.
</P>
<P>
Egypt needs new capital not only from the Arab world, but also
from other foreign investors, Ganzouri told reporters after a
close-door meeting with President of the United Arab Emirates(UAE)
Sheikh Sayed al Nahayyan.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian prime minister made a brief stop-over here after
an Asian tour this month, which has taken him to Malaysia,
Singapore and China.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri said Egypt has mapped out a plan to expand the living
areas by five times of the current level, which now stands at some
55,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The current living areas in Egypt is mainly located at the Nile
Valley, which represented only 5.5 percent of the total territory,
but with more than 90 percent of the population of the country.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of new living areas has turned an "imminent
issue" for Egypt because of an explosion of the population, which
has reached some 60.28 million now, three times of that 50 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
"Our guideline for the land expansion to the outside of
the valley has turned an imminent issue," Ganzouri said.
</P>
<P>
The land expansion is mainly focused on the north of
the Suez Gulf and the southern Nile Valley, Ganzouri added. He
gave no details about investment projects in these areas.
</P>
<P>
However, Ganzouri said that the investment projects will
benefit both Egyptians and investors.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that since Egypt adopted the open-door policy
in 1981, it has successfully obtained 15.47 billion U.S. dollars
for 5,384 investment projects set up in the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is the biggest investor in Egypt, followed by
Kuwait and UAE. The UAE has contributed to 73 investment projects
in Egypt. It also provide Egypt financial assistance.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri said today that the coming period will witness an
upsurge in Egyptian economic cooperation with Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival at the Cairo Airport from his ten-day Asian trip,
the premier made the remarks, summing up his full-agenda visit to
Singapore, Malaysia and China as very "fruitful."
</P>
<P>
"The trip will give a boost to joint ventures and Egyptian
exports to Asian countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri spoke highly of China's economic reform and
development program, saying that he was impressed by the great
changes China has been going through.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen special economic zone and Pudong New District in
Shanghai offer a good example for Egypt in establishing free
economic zones, Ganzouri said. "We hope to work with China in
this respect," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian premier told Xinhua that he held talks with
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and Vice-Premier
Zhu Rongji to explore the prospects for economic, trade and
political cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The immediate outcome (of the trip to China) takes form in
the Sino-Egyptian free trade zone in Suez and a series of
investment projects," he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, the Egyptian prime minister signed an accord on
preparing joint feasibility studies with China for a free trade
zone in north of the Gulf of Suez. Egyptian businessmen and their
Chinese counterparts signed 11 deals and accords for joint
industrial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Egypt also concluded four cooperation accords with Malaysia,
and an agreement on investment protection and promotion as well a
trade pact with Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri is the first Egyptian Prime Minister to visit China
since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1956.

<HEADLINE> Major Opposes European Integration, Devolution for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) - British Prime Minister John Major
said today he was opposed to closer European integration just as
he was against devolution for Scotland.
</P>
<P>
In an election campaign tour to Scotland, Major said that
because the European Union wants Europe's states to break up into
regions, any further transfer of power to the European Union
risked cutting Scotland adrift from the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to win the fifth term of office in Downing Street,
Major said the task of his Conservative party would be to ensure
that Britain "doesn't sink itself into a Europe of the regions" if
the party wins again in the May 1 election.
</P>
<P>
"A centralist, federalist Europe with more authority taken away
from the Westminster parliament and handed to the European
parliament and the Commission and others in Brussels," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also attacked the opposition Labor party's plans to set up a
parliament in Scotland with tax-raising powers and warned that it
was bound to lead to conflict with the parliament in London and
thence to independence for Scotland.
</P>
<P>
"Understand that point! Baldly and in the most straightforward
fashion I say it: the devolutionary proposals of our political
opponents are the first step on the route that inevitably will
lead -- I cannot tell you how soon -- to the break-up of the
United Kingdom as we at present know it," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Major also exchanged arguments with Labor leader Tony
Blair over who would best defend Britain in Europe, after a
surprise intervention by EU Commission head Jacques Santer.
</P>
<P>
Santer on Monday attacked Eurosceptic "doom merchants" and
insisted European states should move towards closer integration.

<HEADLINE> Greek Officials on Greek-Turkish Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos said today that a proposed Greek-Turkish committee of
experts would be of a "strictly procedural nature" and its
objective would be to ascertain whether there were
misunderstandings on each side and to facilitate the procedure
which might possibly arise.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after briefing the main opposition New
Democracy (ND) party leader on foreign policy issues, Pangalos
stressed that political will was required on the part of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He added that Athens intended to pursue with all means possible
the settlement of problems within generally accepted frameworks
such as international law, the International Court at the Hague,
respect for peace and refraining from the use of force.
</P>
<P>
ND leader Costas Karamanlis voiced concern and reservations
about the framework and content of the government handling with
respect to the proposed committee of experts.
</P>
<P>
Karamanlis said that his party would closely watch the
developments and impede any handling by the Greek government which
was not in the nation's best interests and led to increased
tension in Greek-Turkish ties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, commenting on the formation of the committee of
experts, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said later
today that "the ball is in the court of the Dutch presidency" of
the European Union (EU) following Greece's approval and prior to
the reply expected from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Reppas said that if the committee was formed, it could conclude
with findings which, however, would not be binding on either the
Greek or Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties recently accused the socialist PASOK
government of exercising "secret diplomacy" and entering into a
"dialogue" with Turkey with "unforeseeable consequences."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis and his
government also was reportedly caught up in a bitter exchange with
32 Ruling PASOK deputies who warned that the government was
"slipping" into a dialogue with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
They threatened to jeopardize the Simitis-led government's
majority in the Greek parliament by withdrawing their support if
this turned out to be true.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Chrysler Engine Plant Strike Affects 16 Factories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- About 23,000 Chrysler Corp.
workers in 16 North American factories were idle as a result of an
engine plant strike which entered its 12th day today.
</P>
<P>
The latest layoffs came at parts plants in Michigan and Indiana
of the United States and two pickup truck assembly plants in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen Chrysler plants in the United States, Canada and Mexico
have been affected, including the engine plant in Detroit where
1,800 workers kicked off the strike April 10.
</P>
<P>
The strike has affected North American production of the U.S.
No. 3 auto-maker's highly profitable Dodge Ram and Dakota pickups
and Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicles. It also has
stopped production of the Dodge Viper sports car and Dodge Ram
vans.
</P>
<P>
Pickup assembly lines in Lago Alberto and Saltillo in
neighboring Mexico shut down last week and workers were informed
Monday they were laid off indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
High-level talks continued in Detroit on Monday for ending the
strike which was staged for protesting against the company's
outsourcing and other issues. Chrysler was refusing to back down
on its right to farm out 300 jobs covered by the United Auto
Workers (UAW) union to an independent supplier.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations also reportedly continued in a 17-day strike at
the No. 1 automaker General Motors Corp. assembly plant in
Oklahoma City, where long hours are the top issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 12,000 workers at Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. plants
in seven states remained on strike over wages, outsourcing and
other issues. Negotiators for the tire company and the United
Steelworkers of America were to resume their talks today, the
third day of the strike.

MANILA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) today agreed to
continue their talks amid sporadic armed conflicts between the
military and MILF rebels in Mindanao island, the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Lanang Ali, head of the MILF cessation committee, told
reporters that this agreement was reached when the two sides met
today to begin their two-day third round peace talks in Catobato
city in Maguindanao province.
</P>
<P>
Ali said the cessation committees of two sides would also try
to forge a general ceasefire agreement before their meeting ends
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying our best to come up with solutions because we
came here for peace," Ali said. But he declined to give more
details.
</P>
<P>
He said the Manila-MILF joint-committee is due to release a
joint statement on the result of their discussions Thursday,
according to the Philippine News Agency.

The government troops and the MILF have been engaged in
sporadic fighting in some areas of Mindanao island since early

The government also wanted to forge a peace deal with the MILF,
which refused to accept the Manila-MNLF peace accord and has
sought to establish an independent Islamic state.

<P>
URUMQI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Major breakthroughs have been
achieved in the oil and gas exploration in the eastern parts of
the Junggar Basin in Xinjiang, and the birth of a
hundred-million-ton oilfield is expected.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Oil Administration announced here today that the
new-found oilfield is located in Shaqiuhe region, about 130 km
from Urumqi, capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The administration drilled a test well in the area in April,
and high-quality petroleum associated with gas was found above the
underground level of 1,805 meters.
</P>
<P>
Tests of the gas proves that the well is the first high-yield
exploratory well found on China's mainland so far this year, and
gas can be found in an area of 84 sq km around the area.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the area is one of the important rich
oilfields in the east Junggar Basin, with its geological reserve
of oil and natural gas hitting about 100 million tons of oil.
</P>
<P>
Several oilfields have been found in the eastern parts of the
basin, with a total petroleum reserve of 200 million tons. The
area turned out 2.12 million tons of crude oil last year.

However, he said, the target has become unachievable due to
pressures on the office from other fronts and considerations of
issues that have arisen in the course of preparing the bill in
question.
</P>

"We are doing the best we can with our limited resources," he
said. "We are firmly committed to completing the drafting of all

<HEADLINE> Police Urge Early Notification of Handover Events </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Organizers of public events to
mark the handover were advised today to notify the police of their
plans as early as possible so as to ensure minimum inconvenience
to the public.
</P>
<P>
The Police Planning and Implementation Team, which acts as the
link between the organizing bodies and the police, will discuss
with the organizers measures which will take into consideration
the interests of the organizers themselves, the participants and
the public.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference today, Lee Ming-kwai, assistant
commissioner of police (special duties) and also head of the team,
said the unprecedented nature of the handover would most likely
attract organizations or individuals to hold public events.
</P>
<P>
"While the police respect individuals' rights to gather, to
celebrate or to express views, we have to ensure that public
safety and public order are maintained," Lee noted.
</P>
<P>
"We are aware of about 180 celebratory events to be held by
various organizations in June and July this year. They include
fireworks displays, float parades, carnivals, variety shows,
concerts and banquets," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I would urge organizers of public events to notify us early
and furnish details so that police can make necessary arrangements
to facilitate the events," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Lee revealed that a security cordon will be
gradually put in place starting from June 26 to encompass the East
Tamar site, where a farewell ceremony will be held around sunset
on June 30 and the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center
Extension, the venue of a gala banquet on that evening and a
handover ceremony at midnight.
</P>
<P>
There will also be traffic diversions on a few nearby roads.
</P>
<P>
"Our plan is to designate the two sites as a secure zone," he
said. "Any staff, guests or press entering the secure area will
have to go through screening."
</P>
<P>
He assured that the police are adequately trained and
well-geared for the exercise.
</P>
<P>
"We have started a series of training programs which include
study visits to various major international events and overseas
security courses," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
"Special courses are being conducted to boost the search and
VIP protection capability. Acquisition of X-ray machines, metal
detector archways and explosive detectors has already started.
Training for search dogs and handlers has strengthened," Lee
added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong police are responsible for all the security
arrangements of the handover and related particulars.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on New Manufacturing Network Opens in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A seminar on establishing a
network in Asia to enhance the competitiveness of manufacturing
industry of Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the two-day
seminar will examine the level of effective use of both product
design capabilities and manufacturing resources in the Chinese
mainland and the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
About 20 renowned academics from universities in the Chinese
mainland attended the seminar, including presidents and professors
from the Zhejiang University, the Harbin Institute of Technology,
the Beijing University of Science and Technology, the Tongji
University, the Chinese academy of Engineering, Shenyang Institute
of Computing Technology.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the organizer for the seminar said that through
regional and international networking, all functions related to
manufacturing, such as product design and development or
marketing, can be done in different regions around the world where
talent and resources are available at the lowest costs.
</P>
<P>
He said that the advancement of telecommunications technology
has made possible the formation of virtual manufacturing
enterprises through computer networks to tap into the dispersed
global resources.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, a central focus of the seminar will
be to discuss the feasibility of establishing a Dispersed Network
Production System (DNPS) in Hong Kong and in the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the DNPS will give Hong Kong and the Chinese
mainland an edge over others in serving as the Asia-Pacific
manufacturing network center.

<HEADLINE> ADB Predicts High GDP Growth in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is set to register real
GDP growth of 5.4 percent in 1997 and six in 1998 as against 4.4
and 4.7 percent achieved in 1995 and 1996 respectively, a country
projection report of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The report said if the steps, taken up under the reform
programs of the present government after its assumption of office
in June 1996, are carried out properly, the country's economic
performance would register the above GDP (gross domestic products)
growth in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Under the reform programs, the government has taken steps to
restore macroeconomic stability and renew efforts at structural
reform including further privatization of state-owned enterprises
and strengthening implementation of external assistance projects.
</P>
<P>
Giving an elaborate account of the reform programs, the report
said the government has identified over 50 state-owned enterprises
including textile factories, sugar mills, chemical works and steel
plants for privatization by the middle of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the industrial sector began to make quick recovery
in the last quarter of 1996 after a major slow down, said the
report, adding that the growth of this sector is likely to be
seven percent in 1997 and 9.5 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the agricultural sector, the country is set to improve
long-term prospects, the report said, adding that the sector would
expand by over two percent in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Giving a brief account of the country's external trade and
payments, the report said in the next two years, more robust
exports at 14.5 percent and 16.6 percent in 1997 and 1998
respectively will be possible.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Bangladesh's problems and prospects as it
approaches the next century, the report said the main challenges
will be to reduce poverty and improve the living conditions of
people.
</P>
<P>
To make progress in these fields, the GDP growth must be
accelerated and the provision of social services also should be
enhanced, especially in terms of availability to the poor and the
disadvantaged, the report observed.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Police Crack a Number of Drug-Related Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police have reported a
series of successes since the beginning of a new round of targeted
action against narcotics-related crimes, which was kicked off
earlier this month, the Ministry of Public Security announced
today.
</P>
<P>
In north China's Shanxi Province, Li Xiangmin, wanted for the
past eight years on drug trafficking charges and worth 10,000 yuan
(about 1,200 U.S. dollars) of police reward for his capture, was
captured on April 1. In the city of Datong alone, 50 narcotics
crimes were solved and 64 suspects arrested.
</P>
<P>
On April 15, a major trans-province crime ring involved in drug
trafficking was broken up in Chongqing, with six suspects caught,
and 3,331 grams of heroin and 300,000 yuan of drug money retrieved.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, an 11-member drug trafficking gang was apprehended
by police, together with 5,800 grams of heroin.
</P>
<P>
In Yunnan, where drug-related crimes are especially common due
to its location near the notorious "Golden Triangle" of Burma,
Laos and Thailand, 588 kgs of heroin was captured in the first
three months this year.
</P>
<P>
A drug known as MDMA and MDA, an amphetamine nicknamed by the
Chinese as the "shaking head pill," has appeared in some urban
recreational centers in China, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The drug stimulates the nervous system, causing users to become
sexually excited and shake their heads violently. It is dangerous
to health and harmful to social stability, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Such pills have been uncovered in Shanghai, Shenyang and
Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
The current targeted fight will continue through the end of
September, the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> EU Launches New Policy on Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
executive body of the European Union (EU), today launched a
strategy aimed at closer ties with Hong Kong in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
Far from being a time to downgrade links with the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China, the commission said,
1997 must mark another step forward in the relationship.
</P>
<P>
China will resume exercising the sovereignty of Hong Kong on
July 1.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to developing close relations with the
Hong Kong SAR...to ensure that Hong Kong cements its place as one
of our most important Asian partners," said EU Trade Commissioner
Sir Leon Brittan.
</P>
<P>
The EU strategy emphasizes the importance of Hong Kong to the
evolution of relations in Asia as a whole.
</P>
<P>
It also calls for the 15-member European economic alliance to
produce a full annual report on EU-Hong Kong relations, including
commerce, finance and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The commission was confident that free access to the EU would
be in the interests of both the EU and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the EU's 10th largest trading partner, and home to
over 100 financial services companies, 100 manufacturers and the
regional headquarters of some 250 companies with EU origins.

<HEADLINE> Smuggling Hits Tanning Industry in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's tanning industry is
likely to face dire consequences due to an acute shortage of raw
hides and skin, according to industrial operators.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that at least 60 percent of the industry will
close down by July unless timely actions are taken to check
smuggling of local hides and skin into neighboring India.
</P>
<P>
The tanning industry usually collects 40 percent of its total
supply during the Muslim Eid days, when animals are ritually
slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
But this year the industry has virtually failed to procure its
share from the market mainly due to fund shortage. And absence of
tanners from the market has resulted in a drastic fall in prices
of hides and skin.
</P>
<P>
Taking this opportunity, according to industry sources, traders
from India have been active in smuggling out local hides and skin
worth about 2 billion taka (about 50 million U.S. dollars) from
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the trend is checked, the industry will face a serious
setback," said Ali Hossain, secretary general of Bangladesh Hide
and Skin Merchants Association.

<HEADLINE> Samsonov Shows Maturity Beyond His Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 23 (Xinhua) -- As one of the world
best players, Vladimir Samsonov has demonstrated that the
innocent, boyish look is a mere guise for a crafty, lynx-like
animal constantly on the prowl for preys.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old star from Belarus, ranked fourth in the world,
is a force to reckon with in the 44th World Table Tennis
Championships which begins here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"His childish look is very deceptive," said Xu Yinsheng, chief
of the Chinese Table Tennis Association. "He is very fast on feet
and plays a consistent game without obvious loopholes."
</P>
<P>
Xu, who also heads the International Table Tennis Federation,
tipped Samsonov as a title-hopeful in the men's singles event
which kicks off on April 30.
</P>
<P>
Standing 1.88 meters, the lanky Belarussian is willing to rally
until his rival leaves an opening. Once he gets chance, his
lethal forehands rarely fail him.
</P>
<P>
"I think his forehand is the most heaviest in the world,"
commented German world No. 9 Jorg Rosskopf, who will partner
Samsonov to bid for the men's doubles title here.
</P>
<P>
The high-toss serve, invented by Chinese in 1960s, has become
one of the assets for Samsonov. His rivals often misjudge amount
of spin he put on serves, giving him a chance to make a kill.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov is also good at minute and fine maneuvers on the
table, rare for a player of such height.
</P>
<P>
"European players are known for strong loop drives away from
table but not so good at playing short ball. Samsonov is an
exception," said Chinese coach Yin Xiao.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese men's team has put Samsonov and Sweden's world
No. 2 Jan-Ove Waldner as their top threats. "Samsonov and Waldner
are the best all-around players in Europe," said Chinese head
coach Cai Zhenhua.
</P>
<P>
To surprise of Chinese fans, the nation's secret weapon Ding
Song, who had caught top European players nonplused by his
chop-and-attack style in the 1995 world championships, is never a
secret to Samsonov.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov showed composure beyond his years in the World Cup
last October, outlasting Ding in five sets in their first meeting.
</P>
<P>
In the Qatar Open in February, revengeful Ding once again fell
under the consistent topspin play by Samsonov.
</P>
<P>
Ding vows to take a revenge in the Manchester Worlds, but the
Chinese coach said Ding's chance to beat Samsonov was slim. "I
don't count on him," Cai said.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov caught limelight at 16 as he upset Swedish star Peter
Karlsson in the Gothenburg championships in 1993 and narrowly lost
a quarter-final berth to Rosskopf after a five-set marathon in the
1995 event.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov should have come into the medal contention in the
Olympic Games last summer if there weren't a 20-minute delay
during his game against Wang Tao.
</P>
<P>
With Samsonov leading 2-0, an unusual electricity blackout in
the court gave a breather to the jaded Wang, who snatched three
sets in a row to shut his rival out of the last four.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov reached his peak in the European Masters Cup one month
after the Olympics, beating five world elite players to win his
first major title.
</P>
<P>
Waldner rated Samsonov and Rosskopf as odds-on favorites for
the men's doubles event. "They have better teamwork than any
other combinations and have a very good chance to be champions in
Manchester," he said.
</P>
<P>
The pair of different nationalities had beaten world champions
Wang Tao and Lu Lin and Olympic doubles gold medalists Liu
Guoliang and Kong Linghui in the Pro-Tour Grand Prix Finals last
December.

<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Rong Yiren
met here today with former Canadian Prime Minister Martin Brian
Mulroney, former US Secretary of State George Shultz and other
international dignitaries who are in China to attend the second
session of the China International Trust and Investment
Corp.(CITIC) International Advisory Council.
</P>
<P>
Other well-known guests to attend tomorrow's meeting are from
political and business circles of the US, Britain, Japan,
Netherlands, Australia, Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In his welcoming address to the group, Rong said that he hopes
the guests will offer suggestions for China's economic development
and financial reform.
</P>
<P>
Rong said he is convinced that CITIC will make rapid progress
with the help of the council members.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the guests on China's economic development, Rong
attributed the country's continuous, rapid and healthy development
and the effective curbing of inflation to following the socialist
road with Chinese characteristics initiated by late Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping, upholding the policy of reform and opening and
effectively promoting international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China's development still has a long way to go, Rong said, but
China believes that with its own efforts and international
assistance, the outlook is bright.
</P>
<P>
Mulroney said that all of the council members felt free to
speak out on the theme of the session.
</P>
<P>
And Shultz noted that everyone who has an interest in economic
issues is attentive to China's economic development.
</P>
<P>
CITIC, established in 1979, has become a comprehensive
transnational industries group. CITIC International Advisory
Council was set up in 1995 to bring about further expansion of
business, and 13 international figures such as Mulroney and Shultz
were invited to be members.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Become Self-Sufficient in Food: Sharif </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said today that his country would become self-sufficient in
food grains in the next two to three years.
</P>
<P>
The government has worked out a plan to provide incentives to
grains growers to meet the desired objectives, Sharif said while
handing over land to landless peasants at a ceremony held at a
village near Larkana, northern city of Sindh Province.
</P>
<P>
He noted that at present the country is spending about 90
billion rupees (over 2 billion U.S. dollars) yearly on the import
of food grains and other food items.
</P>
<P>
But with an increase in the wheat support price, the growers
will take to wheat cultivation, thus leading the country to
self-sufficiency, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government's plan does not comprise only granting land to
farmers, but it also envisages provision of seeds, fertilizer,
tractors and other inputs so that they may be able to develop and
cultivate their lands, Sharif said.

BONN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Germany's central bank said today it
expected the country's economic recovery to sustain with the

Normalized exchange rates, low interest rates and moderate wage
increases would also contribute to the economic upturn, it added.

<P>
However, the expected economic recovery would not help improve

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Needs New Paddy Fields: Soeharto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
today called on the people to open new paddy fields to meet the
increasing demand of rice in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We will face difficulty in maintaining our self-sufficiency in
rice and import them again if we do not open new rice fields," the
president said when inaugurating the country's longest bridge, the
1,082-meter-long Barito bridge in Beringin village, in south
Kalimantan province, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who observed a one-million hectare peatland project
which is converting into a rice field in central Kalimantan,
before inaugurating the bridge, stressed there is urgency in
opening new rice fields in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said many rice fields have been converted into industrial
zones, resettlement areas, roads and for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 200 million, Indonesia achieved
self-sufficient in rice in 1984. However, the country is currently
under threat as rice-fields are being eaten away by industrial
expansion and disturbed by unfriendly weather.
</P>
<P>
According to data published by the Ministry of Agriculture,
unhulled rice production reached 50.032 million tons in 1996, only
up 0.58 percent compared to the 49.744 million tons in 1995.

</P>
<P>
In its interim report for the period ending on March 31, 1997,
the largest German electronics and engineering company said it had
seen new orders in the six months surging 11 percent, compared
with the same period of the previous fiscal year, to 53.9 billion
marks (31.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
This included foreign contracts worth 35.7 billion marks (21
billion dollars), up 20 percent over a year before, and domestic
orders of 18.2 billion marks (10.7 billion dollars), up only three
percent.
</P>
<P>
Siemens said it had harvested profits from the ongoing economic
boom in North and South America, where orders jumped 35 percent to
10.8 billion marks (6.4 billion dollars). In the Asia-Pacific
region, orders rose 28 percent to 7.3 billion marks (4.3 billion
dollars), boosted by a number of major contracts.
</P>
<P>
Siemens attributed the growth mainly to its telecommunications,
computer and automotive component operations.
</P>
<P>
Turnover in the year's first half increased six percent to 44.7
billion marks (26.3 billion dollars), with 28.2 billion marks
(16.6 billion dollars) abroad, up 11 percent, and 16.5 billion
marks (9.7 billion dollars) at home, down two percent.
</P>
<P>
Capital investments in the six-month period rose to 3.9 billion
marks (2.3 billion dollars), 14.7 percent higher than the 3.4
billion marks (2 billion dollars) in the same period of the
1995-96 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The company's payroll stood at 379,000 worldwide, the same
level as at the end of last fiscal year on October 1996, as a
staff reduction of 3,000 in Germany was offset by another 3,000
employees joining the company's international workforce in the
past six months.

<HEADLINE> World Champ Kong Faces Real Test in Table Tennis Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China's world No. 1
Kong Linghui, the reigning world men's singles champion and the
1995 World Cup winner, will find himself in the unusual role of
underdog in the 44th World Table Tennis Championships which begins
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cai Zhenhua, head coach of the Chinese men's squad, declined to
speculate on Kong's singles campaign, saying the top 20 players in the
world all stood a chance to win the conveted singles title.
</P>
<P>
"I won't be surprised if anyone in the world top 20 rankings
wins the singles event," Cai said.
</P>
<P>
"I won't be surprised either if anyone among the first echelon
is defeated by the rest of the world top 100 players," he added.
</P>
<P>
The men's singles game has been so closely contested that no
one has succeeded in defending his title since Chinese Jiang
Jialiang won the championship in 1985 and 1987.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's Jan-Ove Waldner lifted the singles title in 1989 and
conceded it to teammate Jorgen Persson in 1991. Frenchman
Jean-Philippe Gatien took the 1993 event and fell under a
giant-killing spree by Kong in the 1995 Worlds.
</P>
<P>
"It is much more difficult to win back-to-back in the men's
singles event since so many good players are out there," Cai said.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese men's players now have no advantage over the rest of
the world," the coach added.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Kong, a player willing to rally until his
opponent makes errors or leaves an opening, faces a herculean job
to defend the singles title after a lackluster year dotted with
defeats to South Koreans and Europeans.
</P>
<P>
Kong has been struggling to find former self since a form
reversal caused a defeat to South Korean Kim Taek Soo in the
Atlanta Olympic Games last summer.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese continued his poor form in the World Cup last
September, finishing third in the group after losses to Waldner
and Brazilian Koyama Yugo.
</P>
<P>
Kong then twice lost his team match to the 98th-ranked South
Korean Ou Sang Eun in the Asian championships last December and
Qatar Open in February.
</P>
<P>
South Koreans, known for tenacious spirits and blistering
forehand attacks, are arch rivals for the Chinese, Cai said.
</P>
<P>
Even though Kong avenged his Olympic loss to Kim in the singles
semi-finals at the Asian championships, beating the world best
penholding looper 3-1, pundits hold that the Chinese only has a
fifty-fifty chance against the South Korean if they meet again.
</P>
<P>
The other player able to end Kong's singles run in the
Manchester Worlds is Waldner, the 1992 Olympic champion famed for
his wickedly deceptive serves and ferocious follow-up attacks.
</P>
<P>
Kong has met the Swede four times and lost all encounters.
</P>
<P>
The last time Kong faced the 31-year-old Swede across the net
was the Qatar Open, where the Chinese lost his singles semi-final
3-1.
</P>
<P>
"I have played against Waldner once every year since 1994,"
said Kong. "Even though I lost all four meetings, I think I have
been closing the gap with him."
</P>
<P>
"I have confidence to beat Waldner if I meet him in
Manchester," Kong added.
</P>
<P>
Waldner, who has won the European Top 12 title for seven times,
tipped reigning Olympic and World Cup champion Liu Guoliang
instead as a favorite Chinese for the men's singles title.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese are able to collect four gold medals in this
championships and Liu Guoliang will very likely become the singles
champion, " said Waldner.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- One header in each half from Park
Kun Ha boosted South Korea to a 2-0 victory over host China in a
soccer friendly here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
China pounded South Korean goal almost constantly from the
start in the first half but failed to find a way to beat keeper
Kim Bong Soo.
</P>
<P>
In a dazzling fast counter-attack in the 45th minute, Park Kun
Ha received a long pass from a teammate and headed the ball past
Chinese goalie Ou Chuliang.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mounted all-out attacks after break and had several
scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
But South Korea surged to a 2-0 lead in the 57th minute, when a
South Korean shot hitting the bar of the goal sent the ball just
in front of Park.
</P>
<P>
Park sprinted ahead to head the ball, which bounced on the
ground and flew high over Ou's reaching hands into the net.
</P>
<P>
The game was one of three warm-ups in eight days for China,
which is preparing for the coming World Cup Asian Zone group 8
qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese eleven beat Myanmar 5-0 here on Sunday and will
face Iran next Sunday.

<HEADLINE> First Two Sheep Cloned From Embryo Cells Pregnant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The first two sheep cloned from
laboratory-grown embryo cells are to become mothers, showing that
the cloning does no harm the self-reproduction of cloned animals,
the Daily Telegraph reported today.
</P>
<P>
The mother-to-be twins, named Megan and Morag, were cloned from
cells from the early embryo of a Welsh mountain sheep by
researchers at the Roslin Institute two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The work on Megan and Morag was an important precursor to the
cloning of a Finn Dorset lamb called Dolly, when Ian Wilmut and
his team at the same institute used cells from an adult.
</P>
<P>
The Edinburgh-based institute said on Tuesday that Morag and
Megan were both pregnant, quelling fears that the sheep, who share
a pen with Dolly, might not be able to conceive as a result of
being cloned.
</P>
<P>
"This is a further demonstration of their normality," as both
ewes have conceived by normal means, said Harry Griffin, assistant
director of the institute.
</P>
<P>
Morag is due to give birth next month while Megan's lamb is
expected in July.
</P>
<P>
Concern over the damage the cloning might bring to the sheep
rests on the difficulty of the technique.
</P>
<P>
Only six in every 10 attempts made in the Megan/Morag
experiments worked. After much effort, five clones were produced,
but three sisters died -- two within minutes of birth and the
third within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Post-mortem examinations revealed abnormalities in their
kidneys and cardiovascular system. The lambs tended to be large
for their breed and one had to be delivered by Caesarean section.

SINGAPORE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Four Singaporeans, including a

</P>
<P>
The officers then raided the flat and two unemployed men aged
27 and 24 years and a 15-year-old school girl were detained.
</P>
<P>
In the one-room flat, the officers allegedly recovered two
packets, 114 sachets and 25 straws of heroin weighing a total

trafficking on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Stock Market Plunge Only Temporary, Says Ramos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Ramos today
assured the people that the Tuesday's downward plunge of the
Manila stock market "is just a temporary aberration".
</P>
<P>
In his weekly press conference, Ramos said that the stock
market has already begun to recover this morning with the index
going up 48 points.
</P>
<P>
The country's stock market experienced the biggest drop in five
months Tuesday as the stock index fell by 84.53 points, or 2.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Some feared that the plunge indicated the country's real estate
companies were facing financial problems similar to those in
Thailand, where the financial system has been crippled by loan
defaults to the real estate industry.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the country is economically stable because the
macro-economic fundamentals have been imbedded in the law and
their transparency and continuity have been guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed to the success in the auction of two
billion pesos (76 million US dollar) worth of 20-year fixed rate
treasury bonds with an interest of 14.375 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the auction was an "overwhelming success" because of
the lower than expected quadruple rate and people's confidence to
invest in a longer term "and wait for the results to come in
little by little in due time over a period of 20 years."

<HEADLINE> Siemens Posts One Billion Marks Profit in First Half FY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Siemens AG reported today
a net profit of 1.08 billion marks (635 million U.S. dollars) in
the first half of the 1996-97 fiscal year, thanks to strong growth
in the Americas and Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
In its interim report for the period ending on March 31, 1997,
the largest German electronics and engineering company said it had
seen new orders in the six months surging 11 percent, compared
with the same period of the previous fiscal year, to 53.9 billion
marks (31.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
This included foreign contracts worth 35.7 billion marks (21
billion dollars), up 20 percent over a year before, and domestic
orders of 18.2 billion marks (10.7 billion dollars), up only three
percent.
</P>
<P>
Siemens said it had harvested profits from the ongoing economic
boom in North and South America, where orders jumped 35 percent to
10.8 billion marks (6.4 billion dollars). In the Asia-Pacific
region, orders rose 28 percent to 7.3 billion marks (4.3 billion
dollars), boosted by a number of major contracts.
</P>
<P>
Siemens attributed the growth mainly to its telecommunications,
computer and automotive component operations.
</P>
<P>
Turnover in the year's first half increased six percent to 44.7
billion marks (26.3 billion dollars), with 28.2 billion marks
(16.6 billion dollars) abroad, up 11 percent, and 16.5 billion
marks (9.7 billion dollars) at home, down two percent.
</P>
<P>
Capital investments in the six-month period rose to 3.9 billion
marks (2.3 billion dollars), 14.7 percent higher than the 3.4
billion marks (2 billion dollars) in the same period of the
1995-96 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The company's payroll stood at 379,000 worldwide, the same
level as at the end of last fiscal year on October 1996, as a
staff reduction of 3,000 in Germany was offset by another 3,000
employees joining the company's international workforce.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Russian Duma Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today that efforts by China and Russia's top legislatures
have contributed to the smooth development of the two countries'
relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks this afternoon while meeting Gennady
Seleznev, Speaker of the State Duma, the lower house of Russian
parliament, and leaders of major parties in the Duma.
</P>
<P>
Seleznev extended warm welcome to Jiang's visit, saying that
the Duma is glad that top leaders of both countries have a wide
range of consensus on major international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>

regard the world's multipolarization as necessary and he is
optimistic about the prospect of the Sino-Russian relations.

Yeltsin this morning and that both considered it a proper choice
for the two countries to establish and develop a strategic
partnership of equality and mutual confidence oriented toward the

<HEADLINE> German Gov't, Opposition Fail to Reach Tax Reform Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The German government and the main
opposition party in Bonn said today that they have failed to
strike a compromise on a government plan to overhaul the country
taxation system.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Oskar Lafontaine, leader of the main
opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) met for only one hour
Wednesday in Bonn before announcing the failure of negotiations
which began in February.
</P>
<P>
Both sides blamed the failure of the talks on the other. The
government said in a written statement that the SPD was standing
in the way of a structural reform of the taxation system which was
necessary for economic growth and job creation.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine said Kohl's ruling coalition had deliberately
destroyed the negotiations. The SPD had been ready for tax reforms
even in 1997 and 1998, instead of the government's plan for 1999,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The tax reform plan, proposed by Finance Minister Theo Waigel,
is believed to be the country's biggest tax-revision package since
1949. Aiming at bolstering business confidence, investment and
hiring, it has become the government's top domestic policy
priority and its main recipe to curb record high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
But the realization of the major initiative depends on the
approval of the SPD, which controls a majority in the Bundesrat,
the upper house of the German parliament.
</P>
<P>
A failure of the negotiations means that the tax plan will
begin wending its way through parliamentary committees without
prior approval from the SPD, raising fear that politicians and
interest groups will water down the plan and blunt its edge to
increase investment and hiring.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed tax reform package, the government wants,
among other things, to cut income taxes to 15 percent for low-wage
earners and 39 percent for people with high incomes instead of the
current marginal rates ranging from 25.9 percent to 53
percent. Business revenue tax would also be axed from 47 percent
to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
Government says the package will yield 30 billion marks (17.6
billion U.S. dollars) in net annual tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
The SPD, however, has spoken in favor of keeping the top income
rate at 53 percent or trimming it only modestly, a strategy meant
to keep the tax burden on those best suited to pay.
</P>
<P>
It also wants to boost spending of low-income families by
reducing non-wage labour costs. To the offset the financial
shortfall, it proposed to raise gasoline taxes.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the SPD and the government have held three rounds of
tax negotiations since February 26, but all failed to make
headway.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Scientists Achieves Progress in New Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot scientists have for the
first time made progress in gene therapy by mapping the gene that
causes a hereditary muscular disease to one of the human body's 23
chromosomes, thus paving the way for the eventual treatment of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency (CNA) today, scientists from
the Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics reported to
colleagues at the annual meeting of the American Academy of
Neurology in Boston last week that they have mapped the gene
of the familial form of myasthenia to chromosome 17p.
</P>
<P>
Myasthenia is characterized by the progressive weakness and
exhaustibility of voluntary muscles, such as those of the arms
and legs.
</P>
<P>
Geneticist Kyproulla Christodoulou, one of the four research
group member, was quoted as saying that "this is the first step
to help in gene therapy."
</P>
<P>
"Now we can find out what this gene does and why it
causes the disease, and from there we can suggest ways to
treat it," Christodoulou added.
</P>
<P>
CNA said that the Cypriot presentation at the annual
meeting of the American Academy of Neurology was one of the
five "late breaking news" among 1,200 scientific presentations.
</P>
<P>
The results of the Cypriot scientists' research are published
in the April issue of the international scientific journal
"Human Molecular Genetics".

<HEADLINE> Registration for Presidential Race to Start in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government announced
today that presidential nominees will start registration for the
7th presidential elections, scheduled for a period from April 24
to 28.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported that the announcement was
made by Interior Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati at the
premises of the ministry in downtown Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The minister set the deadline for the registration which
will last for five days from 7 a.m. Thursday to 4 p.m.
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry would send a list of the candidates to
the Guardian Council the following day. The council will
scrutinize them in view of their qualification.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Interior Minister Gholamhussain Bolandian said that the
top priority of his ministry was to protect the legal rights
and safeguard the votes cast by the people in the forthcoming
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
So far, a dozen of dignities, including three ruling clergymen,
have declared themselves as nominees for the 7th presidential
elections, which are scheduled for May 23.
</P>
<P>
They include Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, former
minister of culture and Islamic guidance Mohammad Khatami,
former minister of information Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri and
deputy head of the judiciary Seyed Reza Zavarei.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the 54-year-old parliament speaker
is the front-runner who has a big chance of winning the
presidential race though he lacks the competence and qualifications
for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the main factor of his victory is the
support by Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the rightist
camp called the Association of Combatant Clergymen.
</P>
<P>
However, some political analysts said that the mild and
open personality of Mohammad Khatami is attracting more and more
support from the public, especially the educated people.
</P>
<P>
There will be a fierce battle between the two clergymen.
</P>
<P>
The next president will assume office in August.
</P>
<P>
Since Iran's Constitution bars present President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani from running for a third consecutive term, so the
64-year-old president has to step down.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that Rafsanjani will still remain as No. 2
man only after Iran's Supreme Leader
Khamenei.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Banking System on Verge of Collapse: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Governor of Bangladesh Bank Lutfor
Rahman Sarker has said that the country's banking system is on the
verge of collapse because of default loans.
</P>
<P>
"The country's legal framework for realizing loans is very
weak, as a result, realization of bank loans has become a
complicated issue," the central bank governor was quoted by the
English-language Independent today.
</P>
<P>
The governor said the banking sector is burdened with
outstanding loans to the tune of 130 billion taka (about 3.25
billion U.S. dollars), of which "50 billion taka (about 1.25
billion dollars) remains with 137 persons who can pay back but are
not doing so."
</P>
<P>
Pleading for framing a strong legal framework, the governor
said it was needed for building up a strong banking system to
infuse dynamism in the economy.
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, the central bank urged all commercial banks
to speed up the realization of default loans. However, the move
failed to create much response.
</P>
<P>
Lutfor Rahman Sarker expressed the need for application of
criminal laws for recovering the loans as civil cases proved
ineffective against the defaulters.
</P>
<P>
New criminal law should be formulated to deal with the
defaulters, he said, urging the concerned authorities to take
action against the defaulters to save the country's banking
sector.

Wheat is the main food item in the country, which is followed
by rice.

<P>
The Iranian government said its population stands at less than
60 million at present. However, the U.N. population specialists
estimated its population at predicted 65 million at present.

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe began on Tuesday the
electoral campaign of the ruling Rally for the Republic and the
Union for French Democracy parties by defending the balance sheet of
his government over the past two years. He also called for a new
momentum for the country's economic and social structural reforms.
</P>
<P>

HANOI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Expanding the coverage of social
insurance has become an urgent task for the Vietnamese government,
press reports said here today.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of War Invalids and Social
Affairs told the English-language daily, Vietnam News, that the
expansion of a social insurance system was important for the
welfare of the Vietnamese workers.

<P>
He said it was necessary to expand insurance service to all
workers in every economic sector.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam now has about 37 million workers, but only six million
or 15 percent of the total, have bought compulsory insurance.

<P>
According to government regulations, insurance fund comes from
contributions equivalent to 20 percent of each worker's salary.
</P>
<P>
But, only five percent is deducted directly from a worker's
wage while 15 percent comes from his employer.

<HEADLINE> HKCEC Extension to Be Completed in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center (HKCEC) Extension, the venue of the historic
handover ceremony on midnight June 30, is scheduled for completion
on June 2.
</P>
<P>
A charity dinner for 2,700 people will be held on June 14 to
celebrate the completion of the 4.8-billion-HK-dollar (615 million
 U.S. dollars) complex, Chairman of the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (TDC) Victor Fung told a press conference
here today.
</P>
<P>
The charity dinner, jointly organized by the TDC, the Community
Chest of Hong Kong and the HKCEC, will be the first major event to
take place in the Extension and also a rehearsal of a grand
banquet catering to some 4,000 dignitaries from all over the world
on the handover night.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by the image of a seabird soaring into the sky, the
low-rise Extension will be a new landmark on the Hong Kong
Island's harbor front, symbolizing Hong Kong's importance as a
regional business hub, Fung said.
</P>
<P>
It will be characterized by a sculptural curved roof, which,
ranked among the largest curved roof structures in the world, will
be finished with 40,000 square meters of aluminum cladding.
</P>
<P>
"This is a building all of us should be proud of," Fung
declared.
</P>
<P>
"The extension project well reflects Hong Kong's quest for
excellence. Experts from over 10 countries and regions
collaborated and materials from over 30 countries were sourced to
ensure that the building is designed and constructed to keep
abreast of the highest international standard," he continued.
</P>
<P>
The expanded HKCEC is more than double the size of the existing
center. It will be the second largest exhibition and convention
facility in Asia, with space totaling 63,580 square meters.
</P>
<P>
"The expanded HKCEC will become the city's super showcase and
Hong Kong will be able to measure the economic benefit in billions
of dollars each year across all industries and services sectors,"
Fung said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that trade flows generated directly from
transactions within the expanded HKCEC could be as high as 68.6
billion HK dollars (8.8 billion U.S. dollars) a year, or 2.3
percent of Hong Kong's total trade value of 2.933 trillion HK
dollars (376 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The extension project was entrusted to the TDC by the Hong Kong
government in March 1994, before reclamation and construction
began in June that year.
</P>
<P>
In September 1996, it was announced that China and Britain had
agreed to hold the handover ceremony in the Extension, to be
specific, in the Grand Foyer on Level 5, which catches a
180-degree panoramic harbor view through a huge glass facade.
</P>
<P>
This year's World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual
meeting will also take place in the Extension in September.

LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Michael Johnson
of the United States will take part at an IAAF meet in Sheffield

Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
BAF announced that Johnson, who won gold medals in the 200
meters and 400 meters at the Atlanta Olympics, will compete in the
400 at the Securicor Games in Sheffield on June 29.
</P>
<P>
It will be Johnson's first appearance in Britain in more than
three years. He last ran at an indoor meet in Birmingham in
1994. He had previously raced in Sheffield in 1991 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Johnson was denied a place in the 400m at a meet in
London. Organizers said they didn't want Johnson to demoralize
his British rivals just before the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
Johnson threatened never to run in Britain again, but
Wednesday's announcement indicated he has come to terms with the
BAF. No mention was made of how much he will receive for running
in Sheffield.
</P>

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistan's Budget Deficit to Rise As </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Public debt crisis, the
long-running problem facing Pakistan's economy, is worsening as
the federal government continues its excessive borrowings from the
banking system for the purpose of budgetary support.
</P>
<P>
With only three months left before the end of the current
fiscal year, the prospects of reducing the budget deficit to a
sustainable level by intensifying efforts for tax collection and
cutting down expenditure appears to be dim.
</P>
<P>
Figures available here show that by the end of March, the
federal government had borrowed 74.3 billion rupees (about 1.9
billion US dollars) from the banking system. This exceeds the
actual allocation of 44 billion rupees (11 billion dollars) fixed
for the whole financial year.
</P>
<P>
It is for certain that the budget deficit is to be further
widened as mandatory limits for the government's bank borrowing
had exceeded by more than 59 percent while three months of the
current fiscal year are still left.
</P>
<P>
Economists here believe that during the remaining three month
of 1996-97 fiscal year, the government's borrowings from the banks
may further rise.
</P>
<P>
During the corresponding period of the last fiscal year, the
bank borrowings by the Federal government were only 33.3 billion
rupees (830 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the government's borrowings far in
excess of the given limit in the first three quarters of the
current fiscal year are primarily due to the political crisis that
kept this nation in its grip for almost eight months.
</P>
<P>
The eight-month period covers three administrations -- the
government led by the Pakistan People's Party, the caretakers and
the government of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) -- none of which
could have enough time to reorder and enforce its financial
policies and collect taxes in pursuit of those policies.
</P>
<P>
The latest official figures show that by the end of March, tax
revenues have registered a huge shortfall of 42 billion rupees
(one billion dollars) against the original target of 222 billion
rupees (55 billion dollars) and of 24 billion rupees (571.4
million dollars) against the reduced target of 204 billion rupees
(51 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, expenditure had also exceeded budgetary allocations.
Therefore, it will be an extremely difficult job for the
government to bring the budget deficit appreciably down by
increasing tax revenue and reducing expenditure before the end of
the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The government of the Pakistan Muslim League led by Nawaz
Sharif is now engaged in formulating various packages on the
priority in a bid to spur up industrial production and bring about
buoyancy in economic activity on a wide front.
</P>
<P>
The recent economic revival policy concentrating mainly on tax
reform will certainly help increase savings, investment and
production and, consequently, higher collection of revenue.
However, the new economic policy needs a time-lag to succeed.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's overall economic situation this year is tough. As
the shortage of wheat is persisting, scarcity of other agri
products like sugar and cooking oil is also being predicted for
the coming months.
</P>
<P>
All the indications show that the budget deficit this year will
increase, and there is less likelihood of an escape for the
government from bank borrowings in the remaining three months of
the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the problem of budget deficit is
crucial to successful implementation of monetary and banking
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the caretaker government made certain vital
decisions about financial reforms which include enhancement of the
autonomy and independent functioning of the State Bank of Pakistan
(SBP).
</P>
<P>
The relatively easier access of the government to bank
borrowings does not seem to have changed despite the amendments
recently made in State Bank Act through an ordinance that SBP
besides other matters, has been authorized to exercise a check on
the government's bank borrowings.
</P>
<P>
It appears that SBP has not yet started to use its powers for
discouraging the government from exceeding its limits in respect
of borrowings from the banking system.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the real implementation of financial
reforms will help do away with the political influences on the
banking system. The government should gradually reduce its
dependence on bank borrowings by making efforts to raise its
resources through appropriate taxation measures.
</P>
<P>
However, the rise in government's bank borrowings clearly
indicates that tax collections have not picked up momentum, and a
sizable amount of budget deficit is to continue which will greatly
affect the implementation of the government's all macro economic
reforms.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Gives Speech at Russian Duma (Part I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin, on
a five-day state visit to Russia, today delivered a speech at the
Russian State Duma (the lower house of parliament), entitled
"Working Together for the Establishment of a Just and Equitable
New International Order." The full text of the speech reads as
follows:

Respected Chairman Seleznev,
Friends,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
One year after the visit to China by President Yeltsin, I am in
Russia again to pay yet another state visit to our great
neighbor. It is an exceptional honor and pleasure for me to meet
here today with the respected deputies to the State Duma of the
Russian Federation. I would like to take this opportunity to
convey to you and the Russian people the cordial greetings and
best wishes of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
This morning, in a cordial and sincere atmosphere, President
Yeltsin and I held our fourth summit meeting and signed the Joint
Statement. And very soon the heads of state of China, Russia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan will sign the Agreement on
Mutual Reduction of Military Forces in the Border Areas. The
important achievements of this visit go far beyond the context of
bilateral relations and will greatly enhance peace and stability
in the region and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Mankind is about to conclude yet another century. Looking
back, we see the century saturated with untold human sufferings as
a result of wars and threats of wars. The two world wars in the
first half of the century have brought catastrophic agonies to the
world's people, including the Chinese and Russians. The second
half of the century saw the Cold War that lasted over forty years
accompanied by incessant regional conflicts which gravely impeded
the advancement of global peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Past tragedies must not be allowed to repeat. Having
sacrificed heavily for winning and safeguarding world peace, we
appreciate all the more deeply the value of peace. At this turn
of the century, how to advance the noble cause of peace and
development in the 21st century has become the key question that
statesmen and people around the world must seriously study and
resolve.
</P>
<P>
The world is moving towards multipolarization, a hallmark of
the present-day international situation. At both global and
regional levels, in both political and economic arenas, the trend
of multipolarization is picking up speed. The time when a few big
powers or power blocs could monopolize world affairs and dictate
the fate of others has gone for good. The relations between and
among big powers are in constant shifts and a multitude of power
centers is now taking shape. With increased overall strength and
elevated status, the developing countries have become an important
force on the international scene to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
Regional organizations of various types are increasingly
active, displaying robust dynamism. Though it will still take a
long process for a multipolar world to take place, the trend has
already become an irresistible historical tide which takes on a
crucial significance for the promotion of peace, stability and
development in the world.
</P>
<P>
With the end of the Cold War, global forces for peace have
gained strength. Yes to mutual respect, equality and mutual
benefit and no to hegemonism and power politics. Yes to dialogue
and cooperation and no to confrontation and conflict. This has
become the consensus of more and more countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
As early as in the 1980s, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, after a
scientific analysis of the major and profound changes in the
world, put forth the proposition for the establishment of a just
and equitable new international political and economic order.
This initiative of great vision and far-reaching significance has
since been enthusiastically embraced by the international
community. We in China stand ready to join statesmen of various
countries in making concerted efforts to promote the establishment
of this new international order.
</P>
<P>
This new international order is based on the Five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence. Facts have amply proved that these
principles are consistent with the purposes of the United Nations
Charter, perfectly workable in practice, and reflect the essential
characteristics of a new type of international relations. They
have already become universally recognized norms in international
community.
</P>
<P>
Under the new international order, each country has the right
to choose independently its own development path in light of its
national conditions and no other country has the right to
interfere in. The world is a diverse and colorful place, where
countries differ form each other in terms of historical
background, social system, development level, cultural tradition
and values. These differences, instead of posing barriers to the
development of normal state-to-state relations, should serve as
driving forces behind closer exchanges and cooperation of
countries and greater common development and progress. Imposing
one's own social system and ideology on other countries in
international relations is absolutely unacceptable, and trying to
do so will go nowhere. Only by respecting the independent choices
of various peoples, seeking common ground while setting aside
differences and refraining from interference in each other's
internal affairs can countries live with each other in harmony and
can our world enjoy genuine peace and tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
Under this new international order, all countries, big or
small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are treated as equal members
of the international community and no country should be allowed to
seek hegemony or go in for power politics. Major countries should
shoulder greater responsibility and obligation in maintaining
world peace and stability, reducing armament, promoting
development of all countries and protecting human environment.
Yet this is by no means to suggest that they may dominate the
world or enjoy a privilege to monopolize international affairs.
Matters that fall within the jurisdiction of a country's
sovereignty should be handled by that country, and the affairs of
the world should be handled by all the countries through
consultations on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
Under this new international order, countries are called upon
to use peaceful means to settle their differences or disputes,
instead of resorting to the use or threat of force. They should
increase mutual understanding and trust through dialogues and
consultations and gradually iron out their differences and
problems by way of multilateral or bilateral coordination and
cooperation. Cold War mentality and all other practices
detrimental to world peace and development must be resolutely
discarded. The agreement to be signed by our five countries on
the reduction of military forces gives full expression to a new
security concept that is completely different from the Cold War
mentality. It will offer a useful revelation and open up a new way
for countries to enhance friendship and trust and to maintain
regional and world peace.

<TEXT>
<P>
Under this new international order, countries are urged to
solidify and expand their economic, scientific, technological and
cultural exchanges and cooperation on the basis of equality and
mutual benefit and to promote common development and prosperity.
Unequal and discriminatory policies and practices in economic and
trade relations must be rejected, still less should arbitrary use
of so-called economic sanctions against other countries be
allowed. The world economy is an interrelated and interdependent
whole. The developing countries need the capital and technology
of the developed countries and the developed countries need the
raw materials and market of the developing countries. The
developed countries should respect the interests and needs of the
developing countries and increase their economic input and
technical aid to the latter. If the North-South relations are not
improved and their gap remains wide, it will hurt poor countries
and serves no interest of rich countries either. What is more, it
brings no assurances for world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Having been subjected to aggression and humiliation by foreign
powers for more than a century in its modern history, China
understands full well how hard-won its peace and independence
are. The Chinese people love and cherish peace. Our ongoing
reform, opening up and modernization drive require a peaceful
international environment. We have always pursued an independent
foreign policy of peace and dedicated ourselves to maintaining
world peace and stability and promoting the common development of
all countries. The Chinese Government has stated on many
occasions that China will not participate in arms race, join any
military bloc, or engage in military expansion, nor will it ever
seek hegemony. China has made a unilateral commitment on
unconditional non-first use of nuclear weapons and unconditional
non-use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear
states. China stands for complete prohibition and thorough
destruction of nuclear weapons and supports the establishment of
nuclear-free zones in Latin America, Asia-Pacific, Africa and
other regions. China has provided Ukraine and Kazakhstan with
nuclear security assurances respectively. China and Russia have
announced the mutual detargeting of their nuclear warheads and
mutual non-first use of nuclear weapons against each other.
China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have reached
an agreement on the reduction of military forces in the areas
along their border of more than 7,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The practice of China's foreign policy fully demonstrates that
China is a positive factor and a strong force in the maintenance
of regional and world peace. China's development contributes to
global stability, and a prosperous China means a stronger force
for peace. History has proved repeatedly that whether a nation
poses a threat to world peace is not determined by its power but
by the nature of its domestic and foreign policies. China's
domestic policy is one of wholehearted commitment to socialist
modernization and its foreign policy of independence and peace.
We will not change the fundamental principles underlying these
policies. We will, as always, make unremitting efforts to
safeguard peace in the region and in the world at large.

<HEADLINE> India's Coffee Export Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- India's coffee exports declined
by 6.5 percent in terms of volume and 15 percent in value during
1996-97, the Press Trust of India quoted Coffee Board Chairman
Philippse Mathai as saying here today.
</P>
<P>
The decline was in sharp contrast to the splendid performance
during 1995-96 when coffee exports went up by 23 percent from a
year earlier, Mathai said.
</P>
<P>
As per provisional figures, India exported 160,000 tons of
coffee in 1996-97, fetching 380 million U.S. dollars. In 1995-96,
however, coffee exports hit a record of 171,000 tons, earning 450
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
One major reason for the drop in coffee exports was good
domestic prices, which were 50 percent higher than those on the
world market, he said.
</P>
<P>
India is likely to produce a record 233,000 tons of coffee
during the 1997-98 crop year, Mathai added.

<P>
Russia is a great country. With its vast landmass spanning
Europe and Asia, splendid history and culture, rich natural
resources and industrious and talented people, Russia has a great
potential for development. The Russian people have made
significant contributions to world civilization and human progress
and performed indelible historical services for the victory of the
world anti-fascist war. This great nation is entitled to a proper
place and dignity in the world. As your friendly neighbor, we
sincerely wish you social stability, economic rejuvenation and
your people well-being.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government attaches great importance to developing
friendly and good-neighborly relations with Russia and considers
it as an important aspect of its foreign relations. At present,
the two countries are dedicated to establishing and developing a
strategic partnership of equality and trust geared towards the
21st century. As a new type of state-to-state relationship, this
partnership is based on the following purposes: To deepen
bilateral cooperation, maintain long-term friendship and
good-neighborliness and promote common development and prosperity
to serve the well-being of the two peoples, to intensify bilateral
consultation and coordination in international affairs, uphold
sovereignty, independence and national dignity of the two
countries and safeguard their respective due status and legitimate
rights and interests in the international arena, to bring about a
relaxed and stable international situation through cooperation and
joint effort and push forward the trend of global
multipolarization and the establishment of a just and equitable
new international order. This new relationship between China and
Russian is nothing more than a relationship of friendship and
cooperation. It is not an alliance. Rather than being directed
against any third country or posing a threat to any one, this
relationship serves peace and security in the region and the world
at large and is completely consistent with the trends of the times
and the needs of the shifting international relations.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to efforts of both sides, this strategic partnership is
moving ahead on all fronts. Regular contacts and exchanges
between the leaders of the two countries have become
institutionalized and a hot line between the two governments is
soon to come into operation. Exchanges and contacts between the
two parliaments are also strengthened steadily. Both China and
Russia are rich in natural resources and possess vast markets.
Highly complementary economically, the two countries have seen
their economic relations expanding and their cooperation in the
field of science and technology deepening with each passing day.
The goals set by the two sides for a growing bilateral trade by
the end of the century will surely become reality. There are more
than 4,000 kilometers of common border between the two countries,
most of which has been affirmed in the form of legal
instrument. The remaining border issues left over from history are
being resolved gradually, which will lay a solid foundation for
enhanced trust and closer friendship and good-neighborliness
between the two countries. Both being major powers of influence
and permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, China and
Russia shoulder an important responsibility for safeguarding world
peace and stability. The two sides have similar or identical views
on a host of major international issues and are stepping up
coordination and cooperation in their handling of global and
regional affairs. The Sino-Russian Committee on Friendship, Peace
and Development, which has just been inaugurated, will surely play
an important role in broadening the people-to-people exchanges and
enhancing their mutual understanding and trust between the two
peoples.
</P>
<P>
To sum up, the strategic cooperation between China and Russia
enjoys a solid basis, a broad scope, vast potentials and bright
prospects. Our two peoples are bound forever to be good neighbors,
good partners and good friends. And the tree of friendship between
the two peoples will be evergreen.

<P>
Since the beginning of reform and opening-up 19 years ago,
China has witnessed spectacular economic expansion, marked
improvement in people's living standards, increased ethnic harmony
and a dynamic and vigorous national life. All this has been
achieved under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics. This theory is the single
most precious asset of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese
people. Though Comrade Deng is no longer with us, China's current
domestic and foreign policies will not change, nor is there any
such possibility. Because these policies were formulated in
accordance with China's national interests and the will of its
people. They suit to our national conditions, and have received
the wholehearted support of the Chinese people. We will carry
forward Comrade Deng Xiaoping's behest, and, holding high the
great banner of building socialism with Chinese characteristics,
advance steadily our cause of reform, opening-up and modernization.
</P>
<P>
In some 60 days, the Chinese Government will resume the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. This is a major step
towards the accomplishment of our grand cause of national
reunification. We will ensure Macao's smooth return and the final
settlement of the Taiwan question by continuing to follow "one
country, two systems" policy, for this represents the common
aspiration of the entire Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
China can not develop itself in isolation of the rest of the
world and the world also needs China for its own development. The
maintenance of long-term social stability and economic prosperity
in China is crucial both to the country itself and to the world at
large. China will unswervingly keep to the road of development
suited to its national conditions while vigorously absorbing all
the achievements of human civilization. It stands ready to
conduct extensive international cooperation on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit so as to make ever greater
contributions to world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
With the dawn of a new century breaking on the horizon, we find
ourselves at an important historical moment. The Chinese people
are ready to work with the Russian people and the people in the
rest of the world towards the establishment of a just and
equitable new international order and the creation of a better
world for all.

Thank you!

SHANGHAI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Jinqiao Development Zone,
the largest export-oriented processing zone in the Pudong New Area

industrial output value by the turn of the century, a big leap
from 15 billion yuan in 1996.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Flying Pilgrims Is Iraq's Legitimate Right, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 23 (Xinhua) -- It is Iraq's legitimate right to
fly its pilgrims to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, for hajj home and Iraq
has not violated any U.N. resolution, an Iraqi English newspaper
said today.
</P>
<P>
Naji al-Hadithi, editor-in-chief of the Baghdad Observer, said
in an editorial that the measures taken by the Iraqi government to
fly returning Iraqi pilgrims from Iraqi-Saudi borders to their
home towns "constituted a legitimate exercise of (Iraq's)
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that this move violated no U.N. resolutions but
"was in conformity with international laws and the U.N. charter
as well as with Iraq's full sovereign rights of acting within
its own border and in its own space."
</P>
<P>
The editorial also described a no-fly zone in southern Iraq
as "clear defiance of international law and the U.N. charter
which unequivocally respect the sovereignty of all nations."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government sent eight military helicopters Monday and
Tuesday to its border town of Ar'ar to pick up about 100 elderly
and sick Iraqi pilgrims, who went to Mecca for hajj on board an
Iraqi passenger plane on April 9. That was the first international
flight by Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The helicopters crossed the no-fly zone imposed in southern
Iraq by the U.S., Britain and France after the Gulf War, and
landed safely at the Iraqi-Saudi border area, about 350
kilometers southwest of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government expressed deep concern and anger over the
matter and said Iraq should have asked for U.N. permission to cross
the no-fly zone in advance.
</P>
<P>
Washington insisted that the flight violated U.N. resolutions
661 and 670 adopted after Iraq's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
which declared an airborne blockade on Iraq.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Progress in New and Renewable Energy Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China has scored great
achievements in developing renewable energy from solar, wind,
geothermal and tidal sources.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the annual utilization rate of renewable
energy had reached 300 million tons of standard coal, mostly from
straw stalks and fuel wood used by the farmers as living fuel,
accounting for a quarter of the total national consumption of
primary energy and over 47 percent of energy consumption in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
The country has made world-renowned progress in small-hydro
power utilization, said Wang Xiwu, director of the Environment
Protection and Energy Department under the Ministry of
Agriculture, at the on-going World Energy Council Asia Pacific
Regional Forum.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, more than 6,000 small-hydro power stations
had been set up with a total installed capacity of 16.6 million
kw, generating 49 billion kwh of electricity, accounting for 25
percent of the total that can be exploited.
</P>
<P>
Some 75 percent of the rural households in China have installed
coal-saving stoves. Over 5.7 million rural households used biogas
with annual biogas production of 1.47 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
In terms of sunshine utilization, there were 4.49 million
sq. m. of solar heaters, 5.75 million sq. m. of passive solar
houses, 34,000 sq. m. of solar farm-use greenhouses and 140,000
sets of solar stoves.
</P>
<P>
Wind energy has been used for major electricity generation. To
date, 140,000 sets of household mini and small wind generators
have been applied with a capacity of 12,000 kw, mostly distributed
in the remote pastoral areas, mountain areas, and islands. China
has imported medium and large wind generators from Denmark, the
Netherlands, and the USA to equip 14 power plants which have 120
sets of generating units with a total capacity of 30,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
The total tidal energy that can be exploited in China is 2,170
kw, 90 percent of which is located in Zhejiang and Fujian
provinces. Eight tidal power stations have been set up with a
total installed capacity of 6,120 kw.
</P>
<P>
The reserves of small coal mines that can be exploited reach 10
billion tons. The reserves produced 520 million tons of coal in
1994, making up 43 percent of the national raw coal production.

BANGKOK, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The performance of Thailand's
banking sector in the first quarter this year was not as
satisfactory as expected, as most commercial banks saw a slowdown
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Stock Exchange of Thailand, almost all local
commercial banks reported a low growth and some saw less net
profits than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Thai Farmers Bank, one of the leading commercial banks in the
country, reported a net profit of 2.65 billion baht (106 million
U.S. dollars) in the first quarter of this year, down 11.9 percent
from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Thai Military Bank and Krung Thai Bank also saw a 23-percent
and a 23.7-percent decrease in net profit respectively in the
period.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Bank, another leading commercial bank in Thailand,
registered a net profit of 5.024 billion baht (201 million
dollars) during the period, up only 0.3 percent, but Siam
Commercial Bank fared much better with a net profit of 2.227
billion baht (89.1 million dollars), up 9.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thai commercial banks also saw a slowdown in their lending. The
total lending by local commercial banks was posted at 12.48
trillion baht (about 499.16 billion dollars) in the first three
months of this year, an average growth of only 0.73 percent per
month compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the banks saw a low savings growth, with the
total savings they received in the period amounting to 11 trillion
baht (440 billion dollars), an average increase of only 1.18
percent per month compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts blamed the central bank's reserves regulations
and the sluggish economy for the dismal performance of local
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand, the country's central bank, currently
requires commercial banks to set aside a 15-percent reserve to
cover substandard assets and an 8-percent reserve to cover regular
loans.
</P>
<P>
Some commercial banks complained that they are receiving less
earnings as they are forced to inject more funds into reserves.
</P>
<P>
However, some bankers pointed out that the central bank's
regulations on reserves would make financial institutions stronger
in the long run and prevent them from crises in the future.
</P>
<P>
Currently, some banks are taking measures consolidate their
positions, hoping that their performance will improve in the rest
of the year.

<HEADLINE> China Attaches Great Importance to Sino-Russian Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
today that the Chinese Government attaches great importance to
developing friendly and good-neighborly relations with Russia and
considers them as an important aspect of its foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the statement in an address delivered at Russia's
State Duma (lower house).
</P>
<P>
He said at present, the two countries are dedicated to
establishing and developing a strategic partnership of equality
and trust geared towards the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He added that as a new type of state-to-state relationship,
this partnership aims to deepen bilateral cooperation, maintain
long-term friendship and good-neighborliness and promote common
development and prosperity to serve the well-being of the two
peoples.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President said this partnership also aims to
intensify bilateral consultation and coordination in international
affairs, uphold sovereignty, independence and national dignity of
the two countries and safeguard their respective due status and
legitimate rights and interests in the international order.
</P>
<P>
He said: "This new relationship between China and Russia is
nothing more than a relationship of friendship and cooperation.
It is not an alliance."
</P>
<P>
"Rather than being directed against any third country or posing
a threat to any one, this relationship serves peace and security
in the region and the world at large and is completely consistent
with the trends of the times and the needs of the shifting
international relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that thanks to efforts of both sides, this strategic
partnership is moving ahead on all fronts. Regular contacts and
exchanges between the leaders of the two countries have become
institutionalized and a hot line between the two governments is
soon to come into operation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that exchanges and contacts between the two
parliaments are also strengthened steadily.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that both China and Russia are rich
in natural resources and possess vast markets, and their economies
are highly complementary to each other.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have seen their economic relations expanding
and their cooperation in the field of science and technology
deepening with each passing day, he said.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the goals set by the two sides for a growing
bilateral trade by the end of the century will surely become
reality.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 4,000 kilometers of common borders between
the two countries, most of which have been affirmed in the form of
legal instrument, he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say the remaining border issues left over from
history are being resolved gradually, which will lay a solid
foundation for enhanced trust and closer friendship and
good-neighborliness between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said since both China and Russia are major powers of
influence and permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, they
should shoulder an important responsibility for safeguarding world
peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries have similar or identical views on a
host of major international issues and are stepping up
coordination and cooperation in their handling of global and
regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Russian Committee on Friendship, Peace and
Development, which has just been inaugurated, will surely play an
important role in broadening the people-to-people exchanges and
enhancing their mutual understanding and trust between the two
peoples, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said, "The strategic cooperation between
China and Russia enjoys a solid basis, a broad scope, vast
potentials and bright prospects."
</P>
<P>
"Our two peoples are bound forever to be good neighbors, good
partners and good friends. And the tree of friendship between the
two peoples will be evergreen," he said.

future."

<HEADLINE> Indian Exporters Urged to Use Trading Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Indian President S. D. Sharma
today asked exporters in the country to take advantage of the
opening up of the international trading environment in the
post-GATT era for more exports.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge before us is to take advantage of the more open
international trading environment while ensuring that rules being
formulated for global trade are not inimical to our interests," he
said while presenting the National Export Awards for 1995-96 here.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that India was among the fastest growing
trading countries in the world between 1990-96 with an average
annual growth rate of 11 percent. "Our goal should be to improve
upon this performance through a concerted and well-coordinated
effort involving government and private sector."
</P>
<P>
He said it has also become important for Indian companies to
devise new methods to boost exports by harnessing to their
advantage the strong public opinion in many countries for
eco-friendly products.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue With Its Open, Reform Policies, Jiang Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China will stick to its policies
of opening up and reform, Chinese President Jiang Zemin told the
Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament) today.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of reform and opening-up 19 years ago,
China has witnessed spectacular economic expansion, marked
improvement in people's living standards, increased ethnic harmony
and a dynamic and vigorous national life, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
All this has been achieved under the guidance of Deng
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, said Jiang, adding that the theory is the single
most precious asset of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
Though Comrade Deng is no longer with us, China's current
domestic and foreign policies will not change, nor is there any
such possibility, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
These policies were formulated in accordance with China's
national interests and the will of its people. They suit to
China's national conditions, and have received the wholehearted
support of the Chinese people, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will carry forward Comrade Deng Xiaoping's behest, and,
holding high the great banner of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, advance steadily our cause of reform, opening-up
and modernization," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In some 60 days, the Chinese Government will resume the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. "This is a major step
towards the accomplishment of our grand cause of national
reunification," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We will ensure Macao's smooth return and the final settlement
of the Taiwan question by continuing to follow the `one country,
two systems' policy, for this represents the common aspiration of
the entire Chinese nation."
</P>
<P>
China cannot develop itself in isolation of the rest of the
world and the world also needs China for its own development. The
maintenance of long-term social stability and economic prosperity
in China is crucial both to the country itself and to the world at
large.
</P>
<P>
China will unswervingly keep to the road of development suited
to its national conditions while vigorously absorbing all the
achievements of human civilization. China stands ready to conduct
extensive international cooperation on the basis of world peace
and development, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on Establishment of New World Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today called for greater efforts to establish a just and equitable
new world order.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President made the statement in an address
delivered at Russia's State Duma (lower house).
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the world is moving towards multipolarization, a
hallmark of the present-day international situation.
</P>
<P>
"At both global and regional levels, in both political and
economic arenas, the trend of multipolarization is picking up
speed. The time when a few big powers or power blocs could
monopolize world affairs and dictate the fate of others has gone
for good," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the relations between and among big powers are in
constant shifts and a multitude of power centers is now taking
shape.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries, with increased overall strength and
elevated status, have become an important force on the
international scene to be reckoned with, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Regional organizations of various types are increasingly
active, displaying robust dynamism, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said though it will still take a long
process for a multipolar world to take place, the trend has
already become an irresistible historical tide which takes on a
crucial significance for the promotion of peace, stability and
development in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said with the end of the Cold War, global forces for peace
have gained strength.
</P>
<P>
"Yes to mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and no to
hegemonism and power politics. Yes to dialogue and cooperation
and no to confrontation and conflict. This has become the
consensus of more and more countries."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that in as early as the 1980s, Comrade Deng
Xiaoping, after a scientific analysis of the major and profound
changes in the world, put forth the proposition for the
establishment of a just and equitable new world political order.
</P>
<P>
This initiative of great vision and far-reaching significance
has since been enthusiastically embraced by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
"We in China stand ready to join with statesmen of various
countries in making concerted efforts to promote the establishment
of this new world order," he said.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that the new world order is based on the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have amply proved that these principles are consistent
with the purposes of the U.N. Charter, perfectly workable in
practice, and reflect the essential characteristics of a new type
of international relations. They have already become universally
recognized norms in international community."
</P>
<P>
Under the new world order, each country has the right to choose
independently its own development path in light of its national
conditions and no other country has the right to interfere in.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the world is a diverse and colorful place, where
countries differ from each other in terms of historical
background, social system, development level, cultural tradition
and values.
</P>
<P>
These differences, he added, instead of posing barriers to the
development of normal state-to-state relations, should serve as
driving forces behind closer exchanges and cooperation of
countries and greater common development and progress.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that imposing one's own social system and ideology
on other countries in international relations is absolutely
unacceptable, and trying to do so will go nowhere.
</P>
<P>
"Only by respecting the independent choices of various peoples,
seeking common ground while setting aside differences and
refraining from interference in each other's internal affairs, can
countries live with each other in harmony and can our world enjoy
genuine peace and tranquillity," he said.
</P>
<P>
All countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor,
should be treated as equal members of the international community
and no country should be allowed to seek hegemony or practice
power politics, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President said major countries should shoulder
greater responsibility and obligation in maintaining world peace
and stability, reducing armament, promoting development of all
countries and protecting human environment.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, however, this is by no means to suggest that major
countries may dominate the world or enjoy a privilege to
monopolize international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that matters that fall within the jurisdiction of
a country's sovereignty should be handled by that country, and
that the affairs of the world should be handled by all the
countries through consultations on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
Under this new world order, countries are called upon to use
peaceful means to settle their differences or disputes, instead of
resorting to the use or threat of force, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that they should increase mutual understanding and
trust through dialogues and consultations and gradually iron out
their differences and problems by way of multilateral or bilateral
coordination and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Cold War mentality and all other practices detrimental to world
peace and development must be resolutely discarded, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under this new international order, countries are urged to
solidify and expand their economic, scientific, technological and
cultural exchanges and cooperation on the basis of equality and
mutual benefit and to promote common development and prosperity,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Unequal and discriminatory policies and practices in economic
and trade relations must be rejected, still less should arbitrary
use of so-called economic sanctions against other countries be
allowed, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The world economy is an interrelated and interdependent
whole. The developing countries need the capital and technology
of the developed countries and the developed countries need the
raw materials and market of the developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the developed countries to respect the interests
and needs of the developing countries and increase their economic
input and technical aid to the latter.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the North-South relations are not improved
and their gap remains wide, it will hurt poor countries and serves
no interest of rich countries either. What is more, it brings no
assurances for world peace and stability.

SHANGHAI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai doctors have found a
way to keep patients from relapsing into cataract after the
operation.
</P>
<P>
Extracapsular cataract extraction is a safe and effective
method to treat cataracts, a common disease, which can result in
blindness. But many patients suffered from the capsular opacity
and other complications after the operation, which led to their
declining eye sights.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of late Professor Lu Daoyan, founder of the
hospital's department of ophthalmology, doctors at Shanghai Xinhua
Hospital, led by Wang Litian and Chen Caigen, have found a new
method, which can raise the success rate of cultivating the
epithelial cells, one of the vital procedures in treating
cataracts.
</P>
<P>
The hospital has selected medicines, which proved effective in
reducing the recurrence rate of cataract after the operation, and
will soon produce the medicine on a larger scale.

</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is in Russia on a five-day state visit, made the
remarks when delivering a speech at Russia's State Duma (lower
house of parliament).
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese people love and cherish peace. "Having been
subjected to aggression and humiliation by foreign powers for more
than a century in its modern history, China understands full well
how hard-won its peace and independence are."
</P>
<P>
"Our ongoing reform, opening up and modernization drive require
a peaceful international environment. We have always pursued an
independent foreign policy of peace and dedicated ourselves to
maintaining world peace and stability and promoting the common
development of all countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Chinese Government has stated on many occasions
that China will not participate in arms race, join any military
bloc, or engage in military expansion, nor will it ever seek
hegemony.
</P>
<P>
China has made a unilateral commitment to unconditional
non-first use of nuclear weapons and unconditional non-use or
threat of use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that China stands for complete prohibition and
thorough destruction of nuclear weapons and supports the
establishment of nuclear-free zones in Latin America,
Asia-Pacific, Africa and other regions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said China has provided Ukraine and
Kazakhstan with nuclear security assurances respectively. China
and Russia have announced the mutual detargeting of their nuclear
warheads and mutual non-first use of nuclear weapons against each
other.
</P>
<P>
China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kirghizstan and Tadzhikistan have
reached an agreement on the reduction of military forces in the
areas along their border of more than 7,000 kilometers, he said.
</P>
<P>
The practice of China's foreign policy fully demonstrates that
China is a positive factor and a strong force in the maintenance
of regional and world peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
"China's development contributes to global stability, and a
prosperous China means a stronger force for peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
History has proved repeatedly that whether a nation poses a
threat to world peace is not determined by its power but by the
nature of its domestic and foreign policies, he added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China's domestic policy is one of
wholehearted commitment to socialist modernization and its foreign
policy of independence and peace.
</P>
<P>
"We will not change the fundamental principles underlying these
policies. We will, as always, make unremitting efforts to
safeguard peace in the region and in the world at large," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Growth To Reach 5-6 Percent In 1996-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka should be able to
sustain a growth rate of five to six percent during 1996-2000,
according to a report from the National Economic and Social
Survey.
</P>
<P>
The report said Sri Lanka succeeded in raising its average
economic growth rate from 4.3 percent in 1981-1990 to 5.4 percent
in 1990-1995.
</P>
<P>
Fiscal deficits, however, remained high, which partly explains
the double-digit inflation in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a structural shift has taken place in the
Sri Lankan economy, especially in the share of GDP produced in
agriculture between 1980 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
During that period, the agricultural share in GDP fell from 26
to 20,  industry rose from 27 to 31 percent and services from 46
to 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka now has a better distributional balance between the
income and population shares of the three sectors with agriculture
employing 35 percent, industry 21 percent and services 44 percent
of the economically active population.
</P>
<P>
The investment rate exceeded 25 percent in Sri Lanka
accompanied by a rise in domestic savings in the 1990s. However
the investment rate could not be sustained as the domestic savings
rate failed to catch up with the investment rate, leaving huge
shortfalls in resources.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's export growth accelerated sharply in 1990-1995 and
as a ratio of growth, GDP exports amounted to nearly 26 percent in
1990-1995 compared to 21 percent in 1985-1989.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that by the year 2020 Sri Lanka's
population, which is 18.5 million at present, will increase by
about 30 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Now that telephone lines reach
more than 440,000 households in the Shanghai suburbs, there are
36.6 telephones for every 100 rural families in the area.
</P>
<P>
This average of 11.7 telephones for every 100 local rural
people is much higher than national average of about five for
every 100 persons.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai area now has 1,128 villages where more than 60 percent
of the households have telephones. These "telephone villages" now
account for more than half of the local administrative villages.
</P>
<P>
Rural economic development and income increases for farmers
have encouraged telecommunications bureaus to focus on developing
local villages. Some preferential policies have been made to
encourage local villagers to put in telephones.

<HEADLINE> China, Russia Issue Joint Statement on International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two sides stand ready to promote the disarmament process
while emphasizing the importance of the signing of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the implementation of the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Both sides express concern over the attempt at enlarging and
strengthening military blocs, because such a tendency may pose a
threat to the security of certain countries and aggravate regional
and global tension.
</P>
<P>
4. Both sideds are of the view that the role of the U.N. and
its Security Council should be strengthened and that the
U.N. efforts in maintaining world peace and security merit a
positive appraisal.
</P>
<P>
Believing that the U.N., as the most representative and
authoritative organization composed of sovereign states, has a
world capacity that no other international organization can
possibly replace, both sides are convinced that it ought to be
allowed to play an important role in the establishment and
maintenance of a new international order.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peacekeeping efforts should focus on the prevention of
the occurrence and spread of conflicts. Peacekeeping operations
can be undertaken only by the decision of the U.N. Security
Council and the approval of the countries concerned, and in strict
compliance with the Security Council mandate and its supervision.
</P>
<P>
When deciding to impose sanctions in accordance with relevant
provisions of the U.N. Charter, the Security Council should see to
it that the losses caused by the measure as well as the losses it
brings to third countries and adjacent areas be reduced to the
minimum and that the sanctions be lessened or removed in due
course in light of the implementation of the Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The two sides express the readiness to step up their close
cooperation with the U.N. and its specialized agencies towards
greater efficiency of the organization. Both sides stand ready to
keep up regular consultations on subjects relating to the work of
the U.N. and coordinate their respective actions in this regard in
light of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
5. Both sides underscore that the vast member of developing
countries and the Non-Aligned Movement are important forces in
promoting world multipolarization and building a new international
order.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries have enhanced their awareness of
self-strengthening through unity, played a greater role in world
politics and increased their share of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Their rise will give a strong boost to the historical process
towards the establishment of a new international order.
</P>
<P>
They are entitled to take a rightful place in the future new
international order, participating, on the equal basis, in
international affairs free from any discrimination.
</P>
<P>
6. The two sides point out with satisfaction that the
establishment and expansion of the strategic partnership between
China and Russia based on equality and trust and oriented towards
the 21st century conforms to the global trend of development and
international relations in the post-Cold War world, fully serves
the fundamental interests of the two peoples and conduces to peace
and security in the Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
It constitutes an important practice towards the establishment
of a new international order for the two countries, both permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council, to forge a partnership that
is characterized by good neighborliness and friendship, equality
and trust, mutually-beneficial cooperation and common development,
in strict compliance with the principles of international law and
formulation of a new type of long-term state-to-state relationship
not directed against any third country.
</P>
<P>
The two sides express readiness to vigorously employ and
strengthen the existing system of summit meetings and high-level
contacts whereby their heads of state and government and foreign
ministers meet regularly to exchange views on bilateral relations
and major internation issues.
</P>
<P>
With a sense of historical responsibility for world peace,
development and the future of mankind, the tow sides pledge their
closer coordination and cooperation in international affairs, and
their commitment to harmonious coexistence and cooperation on an
equal footing with all other countries with a view to contributing
their due share to a stronger lasting peace in the world and
common progress of mankind.
</P>
<P>
7. With a new era quickly approaching, under what kind of an
international order will people live in the next century? This
question has been put before the people of all countries in all
its seriousness.
</P>
<P>
The two countries call on all other counties in the world to
engage in active dialogue on the establishment of a just and
equitable new international order based on peace and stability and
stand ready to discuss together all constructive proposals to this
end.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- There are now 14.56 telephones
for every 100 urban residents in north China's Shanxi Province, a
great change when compared with the 4.56 telephones of recent
years.
</P>
<P>
The change comes as a result of the province's having spent
more than 5.8 billion yuan over the past six years on fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
All prefectures and cities in the province have individual
telecom networks and have increased their telephone numbers to
seven digits. They have also built TV conference networks and are
covered by mobile telecome and paging services. The province now
has more than 91,010 mobile phone customers and 350,000 who use

<HEADLINE> Chinese Using "Crazy" English to Improve Their Language Skills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- About 10,000 people were crowded
into a small outdoor square and were shouting English at the top
of their lungs at the prompting of a leader, to the accompaniment
of wild rock-n-roll music.
</P>
<P>
The scene was not in fact a rock concert, but a live
demonstration given recently to residents in Wuhan, the capital of
central China's Hubei province, of how to improve one's
spoken-English.
</P>
<P>
Li Yang, a former English announcer, invented the new "crazy
English teaching method" to help people establish self-confidence
in language learning by getting them to shout out English
expressions to the sound of loud music.
</P>
<P>
The participants were a mixed band of college students,
businessmen, scholars, and retirees, all of whom showed great
enthusiasm for the new method.
</P>
<P>
One elderly woman, named Yu, said that she had gotten a job
selling computers when she retired, but felt that her
spoken-English was poor when she had to do business with
foreigners. "I get my confidence back when I shout in English to
exciting music," she explained.
</P>
<P>
"It is a successful method, which combines English teaching
with music," commented Mai Wen, who works with the method's
inventor. They held the first of a series of demonstrations in
Shenzhen, in south China's Guangdong province, early this year.
</P>
<P>
Mai explained that they plan to show the new method of English
learning to nearly 300 million Chinese in the next three years,
free of charge, and that demonstrations will be held in 100 cities
nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Government Decides to Postpone Municipal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 23 (Xinhua) -- In a move designed to save faces
of the country's three top leaders, the Lebanon's government has
set April 30, 1998, as a deadline for holding municipal and
mayoral elections, the Daily Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
The government, which met under President Elias Hrawi at the
Beirut Presidential Palace Tuesday night, charged Interior
Minister Michel Murr with drafting new law for the elections.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the polls, previously scheduled for June 1
and 8 this year, were effectively postponed when Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri withdrew the draft bill from the parliament earlier
this month, thus angering the president who wanted the elections
to take place on time.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi questioned the legality of the retrieval of the bill by
the government without the president's consent.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night's decisions reflected a comprise that more or
less satisfied each of the troika members, who have been
bickering over a host of issues since last November.
</P>
<P>
The daily noted that the president's candidates for top
administrative posts in three key departments were endorsed,
House Speaker Nabih Berri got the desired eight-month extension
of the parliament's four-year mandate and Hariri won the
postponement of the local elections.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the cabinet's meeting, Information Minister
Bassem al-Sabaa announced that Murr was instructed to draft three
laws, first of which will extend the mandate of current mayors
and municipal councils, due to expire in June, until April 30,
1998.
</P>
<P>
The second decision will regulate local elections and set a
date for them and the third will lengthen the parliament's tenure
to make the next general elections not to fall in the summer of
the year 2000 and disrupt the tourist season.

<HEADLINE> Over 6,000 in Shanghai Vow to Donate Organs After Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- While most Shanghai residents
arranged to have their remains cremated, Ma Longrui chose to
donate his organs for medical research after his death.
</P>
<P>
After the old man died at the age of 83, Ma's family offered
his remains to the Shanghai Medical University, according to his
wish, on April 15.
</P>
<P>
Ma became the latest person among some 1,200 in Shanghai, who
have fulfilled their last wishes to donate organs to medical
research institutes after death.
</P>
<P>
Another 5,000 residents in China's largest metropolis have
signed for donation papers since the city's public health
authority and the local Red Cross society jointly called for organ
donation in 1983.
</P>
<P>
The action allowed Shanghai to be a pioneer in organ donation
in China.
</P>
<P>
However, for most Chinese people, organ donation is still
considered unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has a population of 13 million, but the number of
organ donors is only 400, contrasting sharply with some 100,000
people, the annual number of the death in the city.
</P>
<P>
"Pathologic anatomy is vital to research of diseases and to
finding out treatment methods," said Zhou Xiaohan, director of
Oncologic Department, the Shanghai No.1 People's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
"However, we haven't enough bodies of dead patients to conduct
pathologic anatomy because some backward views have prevented
people from donating their bodies to medical research," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Cremation has become popular among Chinese urbanities because
of several decades of reforms. But it may take a long period for
Chinese people to accept organ donation.
</P>
<P>
"So we feel urgent to educate and encourage people to abandon
the backward views and join in the movement," said Xie Lijuan,
president of the Shanghai Red Cross Society.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that well-schooled scientists and office
workers dominated the organ donors in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In Nanjing, Jiangsu Province's capital city which neighbors
Shanghai, some 500 people have joined in the Friends of Organs
Donors. Many of them were retired government officials and
teachers.
</P>
<P>
They said they decided to become donors after they heard that
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who die at the age 93 on February
19, had told his family to donate his corneas to an eye bank and
offer his organs to medical research after his death.

WUHAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 percent of all the
Yangtze River's white-flag dolphins, an endangered species found
only in China, have settled in the Honghu Lake in Hubei Province,
in central China.
</P>
<P>
The lake has been pollution-free since it was listed as one of
the first wetlands under key state protection in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The wetland is a transitional system between the land ecosystem
and water ecosystem and is the only one with protection from an
international convention. It is regarded as one of three major
ecosystems, along with agricultural and forestry systems, by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Honghu lake covers more than 35,000 ha and is the largest lake
in Hubei. It is home to 68 species of aquatic plants and 167
species of birds.
</P>
<P>
The National Environmental Protection Agency listed the lake as
one of the first wetlands to be given state protection in 1995. In
the past two years, local authorities have developed measures to
stop enterprises around the lake from polluting and to ban the use
of purse seines.
</P>
<P>
It was approved as the first nature reserve for white-flag
dolphins by the Hubei Provincial Government.

<HEADLINE> China's Oil Industry Records Sustained Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China's petroleum industry will
enjoy sustainable growth with the maximum annual oil production
probably reaching 200 million tons by 2010.
</P>
<P>
China has achieved great success in "stabilizing the East while
developing the West and offshore," said Gao Ruiqi, director of the
Prospecting Bureau of the China National Petroleum Corporation, at
the World Energy Council Asia Pacific Regional Forum being held in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China has built 350 oilfields and 110 gasfields, which turned
out 157 million tons of crude oil last year, ranking fifth among
the world oil producers, and produced 20.1 billion cubic meters of
gas, ranking 22nd among the gas producers.
</P>
<P>
After four decades of development, China has built 24 oil and
gas producing bases including Daqing, Shengli, Liaohe, Xinjiang,
Sichuan, Dagang, Bohai, East South China Sea, West South China
Sea, and basically formed the pattern of four major oil and three
major gas producing regions.
</P>
<P>
Among these, the oil output of Songliao region in 1996
accounted for 38 percent of the national total, contributing
greatly to the growth of the national economy. The production of
Bohai Bay in 1996 shared 36.9 percent of the national oil
output. Xinjiang produced 14.3 million tons of crude oil last
year, making up 9.1 percent of the national total. The offshore
production reached 15 million tons, sharing 9.5 percent of the
country's total.
</P>
<P>
According to a national survey, the annual oil output of east
China will maintain 110 million tons in 2010. The annual oil
output of 53 million tons at Daqing Oilfield will be kept until
2000.
</P>
<P>
The exploration will be further accelerated in the west and the
oil output may reach 40-50 million tons in 2010. Offshore oil
production is estimated at 10 million tons or more in 2010.
</P>
<P>
Up to late 1996, the total onshore areas open to foreign
companies reached 2.5 million sq. km. and 30 petroleum contracts
were signed with 35 foreign companies with total volume of 770
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
A total of 109 offshore contracts have been signed with a
foreign capital of 2.96 billion US dollars, which amounts for 58
per cent of the total investment of offshore oil exploration and
development for that period.

<P>
ANKARA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. will render 120 Million
dollars to Turkey in a bid to develop eastern and southeastern
Anatolia, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News quoted U.N. Representative
to Turkey Paul van Hanswick de Jonge as saying that the U.N.
would not only give the 120 million dollars to Turkey, but
also provide technical support as well.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. has been supporting projects established in western
Turkey for 40 years, but from now on, most of new U.N. funds will
be spent to develop eastern and southeastern Anatolia," De Jonge
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Turkish education sector was in need of
support and there was a huge difference between the ratios of
the educated people from the east and west.
</P>
<P>
Education possibilities and the ratio of the educated people
are very low in the east compared to the west, said the
U.N. representative.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Supporting the education sector will promote the
development process in a positive way."
</P>
<P>
On the Turkish economy, De Jonge said that "Turkey has a
special place among the developing countries and has great
economic potential."

<HEADLINE> China, Russia Issue Joint Statement on International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China and Russia issued a joint
statement today on international issues and relations. The full
text of the statement reads as follows:
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the development of a strategic partnership of
equality and mutual trust that is oriented towards the 21st
century, the responsibility towards the international community
and the common attitude towards the major international issues as
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, the People's
Republic of China and the Russian Federation (hereinafter referred
to as the two "sides") hereby state as follows:
</P>
<P>
1. The two sides shall, in the spirit of partnership, strive to
promote the multipolarization of the world and the establishment
of a new international order.
</P>
<P>
The two sides hold the view that international relations at the
close of the 20th century have undergone profound changes
characterized by the end of the Cold War and the disappearance of
the bipolarity.
</P>
<P>
The positive trend towards a multipolar world is accelerating;
relations between major powers, including those between
adversaries in the Cold War era, have undergone changes;
organizations of regional economic cooperation have exhibited
great vitality; the political, economic and cultural evolution in
various countries has presented a scene of diversity, and the
forces making for peace and broad-based international cooperation
have grown in strength.
</P>
<P>
It has become the common understanding of a growing number of
countries to embrace mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit
and reject hegemonism and power politics, to pursue dialogue and
cooperation and avoid confrontation and conflict.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a just and equitable new international
political and economic order based on peace and stability has
become the pressing need of the times and the inevitable necessity
of history.
</P>
<P>
2. Both sides maintain that mutual respect for sovereignty and
territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in
each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit,
peaceful coexistence and other universally recognized principles
of international law should serve as the basic norms governing
state-to-state relations and the basis for the establishment of a
new international order.
</P>
<P>
Each country has the right to independently choose its road of
development in light of its own national conditions and no other
countries should interfere. Differences in social system,
ideology and values must not become obstacles to the development
of normal state-to-state relations.
</P>
<P>
All countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are
equal members of the international community. No country should
seek hegemony, practice power politics or monopolize international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative to eliminate discriminatory policies and
practices in economic relations and to strengthen and expand, on
the basis of equality and mutual benefit, exchanges and
cooperation in the economic, trade, scientific, technological and
cultural fields with a view to promoting common development and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
3. Both sides stand for the establishment of a new and
universally applicable security concept, believing that the "Cold
War mentality" must be abandoned and bloc politics opposed.
</P>
<P>
The differences or disputes between states must be settled
through peaceful means without resorting to the use or threat of
force. Dialogue and consultation should be pursued to promote
mutual understanding and build confidence and peace and security
should be sought through coordination and cooperation at bilateral
or multilateral level.
</P>
<P>
Both sides are of the view that the Commonwealth of Independent
States is an important factor making for stability and development
in Eurasia and point out that the two Agreements signed by China,
Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan on the Enhancement
of Confidence in the Military Field Along the Border Areas and on
the Mutual Reduction of Military Forces are of great significance
in that they may serve as a new model for the achievement of
regional peace, security and stability in the post-Cold War
world.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Not to Import Finished Products From India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government will
not allow the import of finished products like automobiles,
bicycles, cosmetics and other luxury goods from India if trade
with that country is reopened, according to sources close to
Pakistan's Ministry of Industry.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the ministry have suggested that the government
should protect these labor-intensive industries employing tens of
thousands of workers if Pakistan and India were to restart
business ties, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
With positive statements made by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif and his Indian counterpart I.K. Gujral showing intentions
to defuse tension in the region and improve trade ties, it is
likely that both sides will sign some agreements to restart goods
trade in the coming few weeks, they said.
</P>
<P>
But Pakistani manufacturers fear that they would be rendered
out of business by the import of similar goods from India which
most probably will be cheaper than local products, they said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Return Spells Closer Regional Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The approaching return of Hong
Kong to China is leading to increased cooperation and exchanges,
as provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities prepare for
greater business prospects that are inevitable after July 1.
</P>
<P>
"The return will promote economic reorganization in the Pearl
River Delta area and change the structure of the present
factory-shop relations between Guangdong Province and Hong Kong,"
said Xu Dezhi, director of the provincial Commission of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the two places is indispenable as they are
closely linked economically. Neighboring Guangdong provides water,
electricity, vegetables, and meat to Hong Kong, while 80 percent
of its annual exports and imports come and go through Hong Kong
and Macao and more than 70 percent of its overseas investment
comes from the two.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong will try to become more competitive internationally
through joint efforts with Hong Kong, and make better use of Hong
Kong's role as an international free trade zone, and financial and
information center. Guangzhou Port, in the provincial capital, is
dredging its outbound sealane to a depth of 14.5 meters to
accommodate 50,000-ton freighters in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Province, which is north of Guangdong in east China,
will hold a Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Fair in late
May in Hong Kong, a sign of cooperation to come between the
coastal province and Hong Kong, said Yang Zucheng, head of the
provincial Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Commission.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been Zhejiang's largest trade partner. Last year,
18.35 percent of its total exports and imports were through Hong
Kong. The province has 30 trade organizations in Hong Kong, and
Hong Kong has been involved in 6,594 projects in Zhejiang, 47.9
percent of the province's total, which are worth 8.8 billion US
dollars, 52.7 percent of the province's total investment.
</P>
<P>
And closer economic ties are also expected between Hong Kong
and other other provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities
in China.

<HEADLINE> China, Russia Calls for Strengthening of U.N. Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China and Russia said in a joint
statement today that the role of the United Nations (U.N.) and its
Security Council should be strengthened and that the U.N. efforts
in maintaining world peace and security merit a positive appraisal.
</P>
<P>
As the most representative and authoritative organization
composed of sovereign states, the U.N. has a world capacity that
no other international organization can possibly replace, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia are convinced that the U.N. ought to play an
important role in the establishment and maintenance of a new
international order.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peacekeeping efforts should focus on the prevention of
the occurrence and spread of conflicts. Peacekeeping operations
can be undertaken only by the decision of the U.N. Security
Council and the approval of the countries concerned, and in strict
compliance with the Security Council mandate and its supervision,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
When deciding to impose sanctions in accordance with relevant
provisions of the U.N. Charter, the Security Council should see to
it that the losses caused by the measure as well as the losses it
brings to third countries and adjacent areas be reduced to the
minimum and that the sanctions be lessened or removed in due
course in light of the implementation of the Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia agreed to step up their close cooperation with
the U.N. and its specialized agencies towards greater efficiency
of the organization.
</P>
<P>
They said they stand ready to keep up regular consultations on
subjects relating to the work of the U.N. and to coordinate their
respective actions in this regard in light of circumstances.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Three golden monkeys at the
Beijing Breeding Center for Endangered Animals have recently given
birth to three babies that are doing well, according to workers.
</P>
<P>
China has three types of golden monkey, classified according to
their geographic locations. The three are found mainly in Sichuan,
Yunnan and Guizhou provinces in southwest China and in Shaanxi and
Gansu provinces in northwest China. The mothers are the Sichuan
type.
</P>
<P>
Golden monkeys are under Class-A government protection. The
monkeys have beautiful fine hair and live in mountainous areas,
from 1,500 to 3,800 m above sea level. They mate in late fall, and
have a gestation period of six months, giving birth to one
offspring. They are sexually mature at four or six years of age
and have a life expectancy of 16 to 18 years.
</P>
<P>
The survival rate of baby monkeys is very low under artificial
conditions. In the past decade, the Beijing Breeding Center, which
was set up in 1987, has succeeded in breeding 20 golden monkeys,
increasing the number at the center from 11 to more than 30.

<HEADLINE> Former Attorney-General Joins Campaign Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli
Attorney-General Michael Ben-Yair has joined a campaign to demand
a state inquiry into the state prosecution's decision to drop
charges against Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Following the Sunday announcement by current Attorney-General
Elyakim Rubinstein not to indict Netanyahu and Justice Minister
Tzahi Hanegbi for their involvement in the Bar-On scandal,
opponents to the decision immediately formed an organization to
demand that a state inquiry commission be set up to probe the
whole affair.
</P>
<P>
The group organized a demonstration Tuesday night opposite
the Knesset (Parliament), which was attended by Ben-Yair and
several other notables. Ben-Yair, who was appointed by former
Labor Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, resigned in early last
December after being repeatedly attacked by the Likud government
as an political opponent.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Yair's resignation led to the controversial appointment of
former Jerusalem attorney Roni Bar-On as his successor on
January 10. Bar-On's short-lived appointment was later exposed as
a political scandal that involved Netanyahu who allegedly made a
deal with Shas party leader Aryeh Deri, who pushed for Bar-On's
apppointment in hope to obtain a plea bargain deal in his
bribery trial. The state prosecution has announced that Deri was
to be charged with extortion and fraud.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Yair said that only a state inquiry commission, headed by
the High Court of Justice, could provide the public with the
whole truth of what took place in the Bar-On affair. "Without
this the public will lose faith in the current government," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Yair's stand drew a sharp retort from the Likud, which in
a statement denounced him as a man "harboring undisguised
hostility toward the Likud." The statement said that Ben-Yair
himself was a "much-criticized political appointee," who while
in office deliberately dropped indictments against leading
Laborites charged with corruption and elections fraud.
</P>
<P>
This was referring to Bene-Yair's decision to drop charges
against former Labor ministers Binyamin Ben-Eliezer and Yisrael
kessar as well as several Labor lawmakers for their roles in the
1992 Knesset election and 1994 Histadrut (General Trade Union)
election.
</P>
<P>
After Netanyahu's Likud government came to power last June,
Ben-Yair put Likud's Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert on trial for
irregularities in the Likud campaign for the 1988 Knesset
election. He also ordered a police investigation against former
Justice Minister Yaacov Neeman, who was forced to resign last
August.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition Labor and Meretz lawmakers continued
their campaign to topple the Netanyahu government over the
Bar-On scandal. Meretz lawmaker Anat Maor and Labor lawmaker
Dalia Itzik have begun collecting the signatures of 40 lawmakers
needed to convene the Knesset to discuss removing Netanyahu from
office.
</P>
<P>
Raanan Cohen, chairman of Labor's Knesset faction, is
requesting that the Knesset State Control Committee meet this
week to discuss establishing a state inquiry commission into the
Bar-On scandal.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Meretz leader Yossi Sarid and three other Labor
lawmakers submitted petitions to the High Court to overturn the
state prosecution's decision not to indict Netanyahu and other
officials.

IRGC Basij forces are participating in the maneuvers covering
2,000 kilometers of the western and southern borders of Iran.
</P>
<P>

demonstrate the combat readiness of the Iranian forces on land,
in air and sea. However, Iran claimed that the maneuvers were
planned as defensive and deterrent operations.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Inflation Shoots up to 17.5 Percent in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Inflation rate as measured
by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased from 12.8 percent in
February to 17.5 percent in March this year in Tanzania, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by a report of the National Consumer Price
index released by the Bureau of Statistics covering the period
from March 15 to April 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The CPI indicates that the rate of increase in general level
of prices of mass consumption goods rose by 4.7 percent in a
month.
</P>
<P>
This is the first upward trend in one year as inflation
steadily dropped from 26 percent in December 1995 and almost
reached single-digit level in February this year.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge in the price levels has been attributed by Bureau
of Statistics in the Planning Commission to a big increase
recorded by the food group index for a wide range of products
including rice, maize grain, maize flour, beans, cow peas, fruits
and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Experts observed that the food group prices increased by 17.2
percent, which carries a weight of 72 percent in the consumer
basket were the major cause of spiraling inflation.
</P>
<P>
The experts said distribution bottle necks creating food
shortages in major urban markets was responsible for the increase
in the general level of food prices.
</P>
<P>
However, it is noted that from last October to March this
year, Tanzania experienced the worst drought in the last four
decades, and the country is at present facing serious food
shortage.
</P>
<P>
According to an official report, a total of 138,765 tons of
food are needed for about four million Tanzanians facing an acute
food shortage in the country.

<HEADLINE> China's Gezhouba Dam Produces Economic Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Gezhouba Dam on the middle
reaches of Yangtze River has generated 187.8 billion kw/hours of
electricity in the last 15 years and 15 billion yuan worth of
social and economic benefits for central and east China.
</P>
<P>
The dam, which is located in Yichang City in central China's
Hubei Province, has a designed generating capacity of 2.7 million
kw and an annual output of 14.09 billion kw/hours of electricity.
</P>
<P>
It is not far from the construction site of the giant Three
Gorges Dam project.
</P>
<P>
Water conservation experts say that, based on data collected at
the river over a 110-year period that Gezhouba can generate 16.7
billion kw/hours of electricity at most in a good year and could
produce 13.8 billion kw/hours of power in a bad year.
</P>
<P>
It has proved itself to be energy efficient and has helped
connect the central and east China power grid to the national
power grid. Experts say that it provided experience for the Three
Gorges water control dam in terms of construction, operation, and
management.

<HEADLINE> Economy Improves In Chinese Revolutionary Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Yan'an, in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province, which was one of the country's poorest places,
hit a new high last year in sustaining itself when per capita
income of farmers rose to 1,100 yuan and per capita grain
production to 509 kg.
</P>
<P>
The area was the most important revolutionary base in China,
from which Mao Zedong and his colleagues fought the Anti-Japanese
War (1937-1945) and the Liberation War (1945-1949). But, its
remote location and harsh geographical conditions kept it from
developing.
</P>
<P>
But its location on the Loess Plateau turned out to be rich in
mineral resources. Proven reserves of oil there amounted to 430
million tons, of gas 3.3 billion cm, and of coal 7.1 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
The local government has lately focused on developing
resource-related industries, and as a result, petrochemistry,
coal, and electricity have become the city's pillar industries,
contributing greatly to its industrial and financial growth, which
now ranks first among the province's 10 prefectures and cities,
according to Gao Yixin, the city's party secretary. And years of
hard work by its 1.8 million residents has improved its
infrastructure considerably. Villages are now linked by both paved
roads and telephones.
</P>
<P>
In agriculture, the city has concentrated on planting tobacco,
fruit trees, potatoes, and sheep breeding, opening up nearly two
ha of land per capita. These four agricultural industries had 1.36
billion yuan in output value last year, accounting for 70 percent
of its total agricultural production, and providing food and
clothing for 130,000 poor people in the area.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, Yan'an will be a base for exporting
apples, production and processing of potatoes, flue-cured tobacco,
energy, and petrochemistry -- and educating citizens about China's
revolutionary tradition, Gao noted.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Campaign Round up Hamas Activists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security forces have
unleashed a sweeping crackdown on the activists of the Islamic
Resistance Movement, or Hamas, in the West Bank over the past few
days, according to the state-run Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of the activists have been reportedly arrested. Israeli
troops searched mosques, charity bodies, health institutions and
schools under the pretext of preempting terrorist attacks during
the week-long Jewish Passover holiday.
</P>
<P>
In Nablus alone, at least eight people, mostly students at
An Najah University in Nablus, were arrested. Jamal Mansour,
Hamas spokesman from Nablus, told foreign reporters that the
arrest took place during the Eid al-Adha holiday.
</P>
<P>
Mansour said Hamas would not stop its attacks against
Israel until Israel stopped "its measures against Hamas and the
Palestinian people."
</P>
<P>
Mansour, who met Monday with Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat, said that Arafat has plans to hold talks
abroad with Hamas leaders and with opposition leaders George
Habash, head of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, and Nayef Hawatmeh, head of of the Democratic Front
for the Liberation of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dr. Abdel-Aziz Rantisi, who was spokesman for
the 400 Islamic radicals deported by Israel to south Lebanon
in 1992, said in a newspaper interview Tuesday that the
failure of the Oslo process means that Hamas has judged well
and it has no plans to change its political or military
strategy toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
The senior Hamas official, who was released from Beesheba
Prison on Sunday night after serving a 40-month sentence imposed
upon his return in December 1993, called for a continuation of
the intifada (uprising) "which began with stones and never ended,
but developed and continues to develop with new methods that Hamas
is using."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Al-Quds, a Jerusalem Arabic daily, Rantisi said
that: "Hamas today has never been stronger."
</P>
<P>
He did not speak directly about violent attacks and suicide
bombings, but stated clearly that he supported them. "We are
not for useless sacrifices, which would be the case if we
were sending martyrs to Hell, but we were sending them to
Paradise," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Gov't, Rebel Group Suspend Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The peace panels of the Philippine
government and the rebel National Democratic Front have decided to
suspend their ongoing talks due to conflicting positions on the
manner of implementing an agreement they are going to sign.
</P>
<P>
The government panel said in a press statement today that the
two sides made the decision after holding intensive negotiations
on April 19-22 in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The two sides started their talks in the Netherlands earlier
this year and were reported to have made progress towards signing
an accord on human rights and international humanitarian law and
three other agreements.
</P>
<P>
Their talks on human rights and international humanitarian law
have reached a point where they must specify the mode of the
implementation and reject any ambiguous language that could be
interpreted as conferring equal sovereign status on the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The government panel made it clear that the mode of
implementation should be in accordance with the constitutional and
legal processes of the country, but this was rejected by the rebel
side.
</P>
<P>
The National Democratic Front argued that the government
panel's proposal is a violation of the joint Hague Declaration
signed by both parties in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The government panel, however, defended its position that the
declaration, based on mutually acceptable principles, does not
mean that the government diminished its sovereignty in seeking a
principled end to the armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
Because the mode of implementation affects all four
comprehensive agreements, the two sides decided not to continue
their negotiations until this fundamental issue has been resolved,
the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Expanding Social Insurance is Urgent Task in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Only one in six of Vietnam's 37
million workers has so far bought compulsory social insurance as
required by the government, a Labour Ministry official said today.
</P>
<P>
He said getting the remaining 31 million workers to buy the
insurance was now an urgent task for the Vietnamese government.
</P>
<P>
Expansion of the country's new social insurance system was
important to the country's development and was vital to give
Vietnamese workers stability and security, the unnamed official
told the English-Language daily "Vietnam News."
</P>
<P>
He said the insurance scheme needed to be expanded to include all
workers in every economic sector.
</P>
<P>
Under Vietnam's social insurance regulations, the equivalent of
20 percent of a worker's salary is paid into the insurance fund. A
quarter of the amount is deducted from the salary at source, and
the rest is paid by the employer.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economy Forecast To Sustain High Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian economy will
sustain its high growth rate during the next two years, according
to a report released by the Malaysian Institute of Economic
Research (MIER) today.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy was projected to maintain a stable growth
rate of 8.2 percent in 1997 and is forecast to grow further to 8.5
percent in 1998, MIER said in its Malaysian Economic Update for
the first quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's real gross domestic product (GDP) was 8.2 percent in
1996.
</P>
<P>
MIER said private consumption should remain relatively robust
with growth projected at 7.6 percent for 1997 and 8.1 percent in
1998 against 8.0 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The private think tank said that with an anticipated recovery
in the export sector and rapid expansion of domestic activities,
private sector investment would grow at a brisk pace at 13.8
percent for 1997 and at 13.6 percent for 1998 in comparison with a
7.2 percent in 1996. Public investment would also be strong.
</P>
<P>
Exports of goods and non-factor services would grow by 7.0
percent in 1997 and 12.9 percent in 1998 compared with 7.8 percent
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports of goods and non-factor services would grow
at 8.9 percent in 1997 and 13.5 percent in 1998 against 6.0
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit was projected at 14.3 billion
ringgit (about 5.72 billion U.S. dollar). The merchandise balance
was forecast to record a slightly lower surplus of 8.1 billion
ringgit (about 3.24 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997, but would
improve to 10.2 billion ringgit (about 4.08 billion U.S. dollars)
in 1998, MIER said.
</P>
<P>
Monetary policy is expected to remain tight for the whole of
1997 while downside risk of a slightly deteriorating current
account deficit could not be overlooked, MIER said.
</P>
<P>
The underlying inflationary pressure would remain with
inflation expected to stand at 3.7 percent in both 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
The labor market would continue to tighten further with
unemployment forecast at 2.5 percent in 1997 and further down to
2.4 percent in 1998 compared with 2.6 percent in 1996.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves 190 million USD Loan to Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today approved
a loan of 190 million U.S. dollars to finance two Brazilian
projects on land reform and natural resources management.
</P>
<P>
Ninety million dollars will go to the Land Reform and Poverty
Alleviation Project. This will benefit 15,000 poor farmers in the
northeastern states of Brazil, who are currently without land or
do not have enough land to provide for the subsistence needs of
their families.
</P>
<P>
The project, scheduled to be completed on June 30, 2001, will
help the government accelerate its land reform program.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost a total of 150 million dollars and will
get the remaining funds from the Brazilian federal and state
governments and the benefiting communities.
</P>
<P>
A Natural Resources Management Project for the state of Rio
Grande do Sul, in Brazil, will receive 100 million U.S. dollars
from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to improve management of the state's natural
resources in an area of about three million hectares with about
112,000 small farmers. It will increase access to basic social and
income-generating infrastructure services for about 98,000 poor
rural households.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of this project is about 208.4 million dollars,
and the Brazilian government will make up the rest of the money.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Toy Exports to Europe Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's exports of wooden and
soft toys to Europe have been increasing considerably during
recent years, according to the Export Development Board (EDB) here
today.
</P>
<P>
EDB sources said the value of Sri Lankan toy exports to Europe
went up from 32.32 million U.S. dollars in 1992 to 68.11 million
dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The rise is attributed to Sri Lanka's participation in various
international toy fairs under a promotion campaign by the EDB.
</P>
<P>
This year, Sri Lankan toy exporters received orders worth
352.14 million dollars at the Nuremberg International Toy Fair '97
in Germany held recently. Several other orders are under
negotiation, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
There are 75 established toy exporters in Sri Lanka, of whom 50
are wooden toy and 15 soft toy exporters. The wooden toy sector in
Sri Lanka has a long history while the soft toy one is something
new.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that the Sri Lankan toy sector needs a lot of
encouragement as local raw materials such as rubber wood could be
used and employment opportunities created for people even in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
Major markets for Sri Lankan toys are Germany, the Netherlands,
Britain, Japan, Australia, the United States and the Scandinavian
countries, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> 60 Percent of AIDS Victims Dead Within 14 Years in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Sixty percent of the 49,500
Mexicans infected with the AIDS virus over the last 14 years have
died, figures released today from the National Council for the
Control and Prevention of Aids (Conasida) show.
</P>
<P>
Some 29,700 people have died of AIDS since 1983. But Consida
said that the growth in the number of new cases of people with the
HIV virus was slowing down and was now at between 3,000 to 4,000 a
year, an annual increase of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
But Consida said that based on these figures, and on the
premise that for each recorded case four go unrecorded, the number
of AIDS victims in Mexico could be as high as 200,000.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 the death rate from AIDS in Mexico was 3.9 percent for
every 100,000 inhabitants while in 1996 it rose to 4.4 percent,
thus placing AIDS in 16th place as a cause of death.
</P>
<P>
The figures were released to co-incide with the launch of a
four-year program to step up the prevention and control of
HIV, AIDS and other sexually-transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
Figures indicate that HIV Infection rate through blood
transfusions has shown a marked decrease, from 17 percent in 1989
to 8.3 at present. The infection rate among prostitutes is 0.04
percent.

<HEADLINE> Europe Fights Transport Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The two-day meeting of the
European transport ministers ended today in Berlin with approval
of a resolution to fight smuggling and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
German Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann said transport
crime among European Union countries caused losses of one billion
marks (about 580 million U.S. dollars) during the period, 1990 to
1994. In 1995, German losses amounted to 21 million marks (12
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The meeting aimed at working out a transport policy and
strategy to combat rising transport crime in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said European countries would improve
conditions for information and data exchanges to ensure police
could take rapid action against criminals.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also discussed transport conditions between east
and west European countries, and agreed to resolve the problem of
traffic congestion, especially in border areas.
</P>
<P>
Thirty European transport ministers attended the meeting. The
next one will be held in Copenhagen, Denmark.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia which has over 51.72
million U.S. dollars investment in Sri Lanka, will play an
important role in the development of the country's economy,
Malaysian High Commission sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that potential for Malaysian investment in Sri
Lanka was enormous. There are 26 Malaysian projects in Sri Lanka.
Once the country's ethnic problem was solved, there would be a
flood of investment from Malaysia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
They said that there was a lot of scope for trade expansion
between the two countries. Malaysia is emerging as one of the
largest trading nations in the world. Today it was the world's
19th largest exporter and 17th largest importer.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade between the two countries was gradually growing
in recent years. Sri Lanka imported goods worth 110.5 million U.S.
dollars and exported to Malaysia goods worth around 19.3 million
dollars in 1996, the sources added.

<P>
KATHMANDU, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Police are taking new
measures to tighten security in this capital city as the crime
rate rose over 12.6 percent in the past year, a senior police
officer said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Inspector General of Police Dhalman Thapa told a press

</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters on the new forms of crimes in Kathmandu
during recent months, Thapa said that the crime of vehicle theft
from private houses and parking areas was on the rise and the
stolen cars were often deserted by the criminals after being used
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
Another form of theft on the rise was related with breaking
into locked houses after pelting stones at the windowpanes, he
said.

hostages in Lima, but regretted that Tokyo had not been informed
in advance, reports said.
</P>
<P>
All of the Japanese captives, 12 businessmen and 12 diplomats,
were rescued safely, Hashimoto said in televised speech from his
office, after the assault on the Japanese ambassador's residence
by a 150-strong Peruvian strike team ended a four-month-long
standoff with rebels in Lima.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to thank (Peruvian) President (Alberto) Fujimori
and the Peruvian government for carrying out a splendid rescue,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"I want to rejoice together that they (the hostages) are all
safe," he said.
</P>
<P>
One hostage and two soldiers were killed in the assault, along
with the 14 hostage-takers, reports from Lima quoted Fujimori as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Hashimoto said that Japan was "regrettable" that
it had not been informed of the raid beforehand. "But I understand
(the decision of the Peruvian government)," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the four-month long crisis, Japan had repeatedly asked
Fujimori to avoid measures that might endanger the lives of the
captives.
</P>
<P>
Now with the crisis over, Hashimoto defended Fujimori's
actions. "Now that all the hostages were safely freed, no one can
blame Fujimori for using force (to settle the crisis)," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said the
United States had some "indications" in advance that Peruvian armed
forces were preparing to storm the Japanese ambassador's residence
in Lima, but received no prior word officially.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. played virtually no role," Cohen said in an interview
with CNN.
</P>
<P>
At the White House, spokesman Eric Rubin said the U.S. has
taken the position that the rebels bear "full responsibility for
this crisis. We have stated that the Peruvian government was right
not to make concessions to terrorists."
</P>
<P>
And in Ottawa, Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said on
Tuesday that Canada had preferred peaceful means to end the Lima
hostage crisis, but nonetheless supported the result, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
"We would have...preferred to see the resolution take place by
more peaceful means, but that was simply a preference," Axworthy
told reporters after the raid on the Japanese ambassador's
residence began.
</P>
<P>
The armed Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) guerrillas
stormed the Japanese Ambassador Morihisa Aoki's residence in Lima
on December 17 during a cocktail party marking Japanese emperor's
birthday and took almost 500 guests hostage.
</P>
<P>
They released most of the hostages later, but had held 72 male
captives to press their demand for the release of their jailed
comrades.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Complete National Car Program by 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government said
its national car program would be over by the time a Japanese
complaint was ruled on by the World Trade Organization (WTO) in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Industry and Trade Minister Tunky Ariwibowo said here Tuesday
night after attending a limited cabinet meeting that he was
optimistic Indonesia's national car program would be completed by
1999 when the car would have a local parts content of 60 percent
-- a hurdle which allows all autos similar tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto ruled in February 1996 that producers of a
national car would be granted exemptions on import duties and
luxury taxes, which add about 60 percent to the price of other
cars in the country.
</P>
<P>
Pt. Timor Putra Nasional (TPN) controlled by the president's
youngest son Hutomo Mandala Putra was chosen as the first national
car supplier and is required to clear an eventual 60 percent local
content goal by 1999.
</P>
<P>
Tunky said the government would provide whatever assistance TPN
needed to finish the program by 1999.
</P>
<P>
Last October, Japan, the European Union and the United States
filed separate complaints with the WTO over the policy which they
say is discriminatory and violates WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
Japan, after months of bilateral negotiations with Indonesia,
decided last week to take the issue to a WTO panel later this
month.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto Monday ordered an end to bilateral
negotiations on the issue with Japan and said Indonesia will
continue to produce the Timor national car despite pressure from
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Tunky will go to Japan today on a four-day trade mission but he
will not discuss the car issue during the visit, official sources
said today.

<HEADLINE> Ninth Summit Meeting of Andean Group Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUCRE, BOLIVIA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Closer ties with other
regional blocs, free trade and reform are top of the agenda of a
two-day summit between the presidents of the four-nation
free-trade zone of the Andean Group.
</P>
<P>
These three fundamental issues are included in a draft of the
Sucre Act, the main document of the summit, which is due to be
signed later today by the presidents of Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia
and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The Sucre Act also proposes the institutionalization of a
dialogue between the group and China, and a strategy of
association with South America's biggest trade bloc Mercosur, of
which Bolivia is already an associate member.
</P>
<P>
The presidents will also discuss how to persuade Peru, which
quit the organization in early April, to rejoin. Peru announced
on April 12 that it would leave the group, claiming it was still
limiting free and fair trade.
</P>
<P>
Its decision came in the wake of the refusal by other members
to grant Peru exemptions from the free-trade regime. Peru also
accused those members which had already implemented a duty-free
policy of subsidizing their exports to Peru.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the summit, Ecuadoran President
Fabrian Alarcon stressed the need to transform the Andean Group
into an authentic free trade zone to push forward regional
integration.
</P>
<P>
He said Andean countries could not remain isolated. They must
remain united as this was the only way to take advantage of the
enormous market potential in South America and in the regions of
other trade blocs.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the summit, Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de
Lozada said that the Andean Group would seek closer ties with
Asia-Pacific countries.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian President Ernesto Prez Balladares and Paraguayan
President Juan Carlos Wasmosy are taking part in the summit as
guests.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance to Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved a loan for Rwanda equivalent to some 12
million U.S. dollars under its emergency post-conflict assistance,
to back the government's economic program for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The program covers a transitional phase which could lead to the
adoption of a medium-term strategy eligible for loans under the
fund's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF).
</P>
<P>
The strategy is aimed at promoting the economic and social
reintegration of over two million former refugees and fostering
economic and financial recovery.
</P>
<P>
The tiny African country's economy was devastated in 1994 after
a wide-spread a conflict between the Hutu-led government and the
Tutsi-led rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front.
</P>
<P>
The turmoil resulted in a genocide in which a total of 500,000
Rwandese were killed and five million became refugees .
</P>
<P>
The main plank of Rwanda's reform efforts this year will be
fiscal consolidation through a reduction in the budget deficit
from 2.7 percent of GDP in 1996 to 0.9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Budgetary revenue is projected to increase by about 26 percent
to the equivalent of 10.3 percent of GDP, while expenditure will
be allowed to increase by only 7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda joined the IMF in September 1963. Its quota is about 81
million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF credit currently
stands at about 23 million dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today approved
a 125 million U.S. dollar loan for a Provincial Agriculture
Development Project in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to increase and diversify agriculture
production and exports and to improve the productivity of land use
by introducing new technologies and modern varieties of existing
crops. It will also help increase and stabilize the incomes of
some 120,000 small-and medium-sized farms.
</P>
<P>
Argentina has a total of some 420,000 farms across the country,
nearly half of which are smaller than 50 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Sub-projects already approved to be financed by the loan
include the development of the Colorado River Valley in the
province of Buenos Aires, irrigation and drainage in Montecaseros,
province of Mendoza and the Medndoza provincial irrigation
program, flood control in Pozo Borrado in the province of Santa Fe
and others.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is some 357.2 million dollars. In
addition to the World Bank loan, another 125 million loan will be
provided by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), 90 million
dollars coming from Argentine federal and provincial funds and
17.2 million dollars from beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
The project will be implemented over a seven year period.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (39-40) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (39-40)
in a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Who has the power of final adjudication in Hong Kong
after 1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Before 1997, under British colonial rule, Hong Kong has
applied British laws and a British legal system. Lawsuits are
routed, according to different categories and classes, to
magistrates' courts, districts courts and the High Court.
</P>
<P>
However, Hong Kong has never had the power of final
adjudication. The court of final appeal is in the British Privy
Council.
</P>
<P>
After 1997, to ensure that the Hong Kong SAR have a high degree
of autonomy and full and independent judicial power, the Basic Law
stipulates that the Hong Kong SAR be vested with the power of
final adjudication except for cases concerning national
territorial integrity, national defence, diplomacy and relations
between the central authorities and the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Lawsuits within the Hong Kong SAR may be subject to final
adjudication by the Court of Final Adjudication of the Hong Kong
SAR.
</P>
<P>
Question: How will the judiciary of the Hong Kong SAR be
established?
</P>
<P>
Answer: After 1997, the judicial system previously practised in
Hong Kong will be maintained except fro those changes compelled by
the establishedment of the Court of Final Appeal of the Hong Kong
SAR.
</P>
<P>
That is to say, the current judicial system of Hong Kong will
remain basically unchanged after 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, "basically unchanged" does not mean no change at
all. The most important change is seen in the relationship between
the Hong Kong courts and the British Privy Council.
</P>
<P>
Before 1997, the power of final adjudication goes to the
British Privy Council. After 1997, a Court of Final Appeal will be
established in the Hong Kong SAR to exercise the power of final
adjudication.
</P>
<P>
This not only abolishes a judiciary system with strong colonial
features, but also represents Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy
under Chinese sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Court of Final Appeal, to be established in the
Hong Kong SAR will be the High Court, district courts,
magistrates' courts and other special courts. The High Court
consists of the Court of Appeal and the Court of First Instance.

<HEADLINE> Trans-Mekong Road Corridor to Gain Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A proposed plan on building an
east-west road corridor traversing the Greater Mekong Region (GMS)
is expected to gain speed after Thailand, Laos and Vietnam have
agreed to push it ahead.
</P>
<P>
The corridor, which will link Malamang in Myanmar, Mae Sot in
Tak province and Mukdahan in Mukdahan province in Thailand,
Savannakhet in Laos, and Danang in Vietnam, is designed to provide
a land short-cut between the Indian and Pacific oceans to
facilitate flows of goods.
</P>
<P>
The three countries made the decision to push the project at a
GMS ministerial meeting last week in Manila, according to
officials from the Thai National Economic and Social Development
Board.
</P>
<P>
They are seeking funds for the project from international
lending institutions, especially the Asian Development Bank, local
newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
The Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund from Japan has agreed to
offer 20 million U.S. dollars in soft loans to finance the
project, which includes the upgrading of the ports at Malamang and
Danang.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government also is expected to provide 500 million
baht (20 million dollars) to help build the road section within
Thailand. the Thai government earlier had agreed to finance
one-half of the construction cost for a bridge at Mukdahan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the World Bank will finance Vietnam for building
the section of the highway running from the Laotian border to
Danang.
</P>
<P>
However, Myanmar has not made any decision to push the project
due to the political situation in the country, local newspapers
said.

He said great progress had been made in reducing the number of
people living below the poverty line. It significantly dropped

The government launched a special poverty alleviation program
in 1994 for least-developed villages, called the Presidential Aid
for Least-developed Villages (IDT), in which each poor village
received 20 million rupiah (8,390 U.S. dollars). In this fiscal
year, the government has allocated 479 billion rupiah (204.7
million U.S. dollars) to 22 least-developed villages.

<P>
VIENNA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Austrian government decided
today to send troops to join the multinational protection force in
Albania, a Government news release said.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian Council of Ministers agreed to send 115 troops on
Thursday to be part of the Italian-led multinational protection
force.
</P>
<P>
The decision was to go to the National Council (lower house of
the parliament) this evening for approval.
</P>
<P>
Albania was plunged into chaos in early March after the
collapse of dozens of pyramid savings schemes, which left
thousands of Albanians penniless.
</P>
<P>
Protests turned violent after armed rebels looted army depots
and took over several towns in the south.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government had to call for international aid and
military intervention to help restore order in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian government said the decision to send troops was
made in line with the United Nations Security Council Resolution
1101 adopted on March 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the three-month mission, the Austrian soldiers will be
responsible for the security of the headquarters of the protection

BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Bank (SDB)
plans to inject 1.41 billion US dollars this year to bolster

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The third round of preliminary
talks between the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) will be held today as scheduled despite
renewed clashes between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Ghazali Gaafar, who is in charge of the MILF's political
affairs, said their technical committee on cessation of
hostilities was ready to discuss with its government counterparts
the forging of an expanded ceasefire, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
Both sides earlier agreed to a ceasefire in Central Mindanao,
known as the Buldon ceasefire after having a number of clashes
earlier this year. An expanded truce would include all other areas
where the MILF operated.
</P>
<P>
According to Gaafar, the coming peace talks were very crucial
since it will also discuss the future timetable for the MILF to
enter formal peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the military clashed in a number of places last
week. At least two soldiers and 25 rebels were killed in the
incidents. The two sides blamed each other for first provoking the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
Gaafar has called on the Interim Ceasefire Monitoring
Committee, an independent third-party formed to oversee the Buldon
truce, to start monitoring truce violations in Buldon in
Maguindanao province, where thousands of soldiers and MILF
fighters are facing a standoff.
</P>
<P>
MILF is a splinter group of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front which signed a peace agreement with the
government last year. With 12,000 fighters, the MILF is now the
biggest rebel group in the country.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Urged to Anoint Successor Before Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the ruling Lakas-NUCD
party preferred that President Fidel Ramos anoints his successor
before the party holds its national convention.
</P>
<P>
Lakas leaders said an early anointment will ensure the ruling
party to rally behind a single candidate, the Manila Chronicle
reported today. However, the paper did not explain when the
national convention will be held.
</P>
<P>
According to Presidential Legal Adviser Narciso Nario, the
national directorate is giving Ramos a mandate to anoint the
Lakas-NUCD bet before the convention.
</P>
<P>
Selecting the successor as early as possible will be better as
it will affirm the confidence of the entire membership of the
party to the leadership of the anointed, Nario said.
</P>
<P>
Nario admitted that the party's national convention is
"divisive and offensive" if there will be many choices among its
members.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Jose de Venecia and Defense Secretary Renato de
Villa are considered strong rivals for the party's nomination. To
get the endorsement of the president, De Villa hinted he would
join the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that President Ramos' endorsement is worth a
minimum of four million votes, a guarantee of success for the
anointed one in the 1998 presidential elections.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Labor Lead Shrinks to Five Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain's general election was
thrown wide open as opposition Labor Party's huge lead over the
ruling Conservatives in most opinion polls reduced dramatically to
just five points from 14 last week.
</P>
<P>
According to an opinon poll released in Wednesday's "the
Guardian" newspaper, Labor was now on 42 percentage point, down
three points from last week, while the Conservatives was at 37
percent with a rise of six points, and the third largest party
Liberal Democrats at 14 percent, down five points.
</P>
<P>
The ICM/Guardian poll, which was conducted on Sunday and
Monday, is the first poll giving the party a single-figure lead
since November 1993, and its fall to 43 percent is Labor Party's
worst rating under Tony Blair's leadership since July 1994.
</P>
<P>
ICM's poll confirms a Conservative comeback since Prime
Minister John Major was forced by internal pressure to confront
the EU question head-on at his press conference a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The poll shows that the Conservatives get more support than
Labor on Europe. Asked which party they think will best represent
Britain's interest in EU, 36 percent chose the Conservatives with
Labor 28. The ruling party has also moved ahead of Labor on best
policies for dealing with the economy, a traditionally accurate
signpost to the public's voting intention.

observing the third anniversary of the late president's death.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in front of the late president's grave, Qi Huaiyuan,
head of the delegation and veteran diplomat, said that Nixon was
an outstanding statesman of the contemporary history with
foresight, courage and insight.
</P>
<P>
Nixon's historic China visit 25 years ago, which was made when
the two countries had been kept apart and antagonistic with each
other for a long time, was something extraordinary, said Qi,
former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and now president of the
Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries
(CPAFFC).
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people will always remember him and his
contributions to developing the Sino-U.S. relations," Qi said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the present relations between the two countries,
Qi said that although there have been ups and downs, development
is the trend.
</P>
<P>
Qi and his delegation visited the Richard Nixon Library and
Birthplace. They also toured the library's galleries and the
newest special exhibit, "Pacific Visions: Asia and the American
Presidency," an exhibition highlighting Nixon's role in the
opening of U.S. relations with China.
</P>
<P>
The CPAFFC's southern California visit was the final leg of its
four-city tour. While in the area, the delegation also visited La
Casa Pacifica in San Clemente, which served as the Western White
House during the Nixon Administration and is now a private home.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1954, CPAFFC aims at promoting cultural, economic
and education exchange between China and other nations. According
to the delegation, 100 American high school students will meet the
same number of Chinese students this summer in China to observe
the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-U.S. Shanghai
Communique and discuss the relations between the two countries in
the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Youngest Table Tennis Player Here for Experience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 23 (Xinhua) -- English table tennis
player Katy Parker, at the age of 12 years and 144 days, will
become the youngest English athlete to play in a world
championships on May Day.
</P>
<P>
Parker, daughter of Jill Hammersley, the former European
champion, will partner Michael Chan, 13, in the mixed doubles at
the 44th World Table Tennis Championships, which begin with the
team event in Mnchester on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
She began playing table tennis at the age of six, standing on a
box to see above the table, and won national championships at
under-10, under-11 and under-12.
</P>
<P>
"She's level headed and a clever player," said Carole Moore,
chairman of the junior selection committee of the English Table
Tennis Association. "I'm sure she will give a good amount of
herself."
</P>
<P>
Parker's parents support her selection for the championships.
Both are aware of the dangers of burn-out, which prompted the
tennis prodigy, Jennifer Capriati, at 14 years and 90 days the
youngest competitor in the modern era at Wimbledon, to drop out of
the game temporarily.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of kids who are pushed into playing give up," Parker's
mother said. "It's up to her how much she plays. I'm not worried
that she will be frightened by the occasion. We've said to
her: 'You're here for experience."

<HEADLINE> OHR Says Sharing Concerns Over Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Office of High
Representative (OHR) said on Tuesday that it shares the concerns
expressed by Alija Izetbegovic, chairman of the Bosnian
presidency, over the slow implementation of the Dayton peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, we fully share president Izetbegovic's concerns about
the status of implementation," said Simon Haselock, spokesman for
OHR, the organization in charge of the peace accords
implementation.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic expressed his concerns in an assessment on the
implementation process which he presented on Monday to the
representatives from the 5-nation contact group and Islamic
nations as well as High Representative Carl Bildt.
</P>
<P>
The assessment listed nine areas in which provisions of the
Dayton accords have either been violated or implemented slowly,
such as the institutions, return of refugees and continued
inter-entity border disputes.
</P>
<P>
Haselock said that the OHR has also underlined the importance
of common institutions to the peace process, and appealed again to
all the Bosnian parties involved to make sure they make these
common institutions such as the national parliament and central
bank effective.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Optimistic on Chemical Weapons Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today said he was optimistic that the Senate will ratify the
Chemical Weapons Convention before it takes effect on April 29.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for a trip to flood-ravaged North Dakota,
Clinton told reporters that Vice President Al Gore and others in
the administration had been working to win the Senate approval of
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that the administration has agreed with treaty
opponents on the 28 "clarifying" amendments shows "the good faith
in which we have proceeded."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "We have worked very hard on this, and I'm
actually quite optimistic."
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which bans the development, production,
stockpiling, transferring and use of chemical weapons, has been
ratified by 74 countries.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the treaty in the U.S. Senate argued that the
treaty is "unenforceable" and "not global", demanding the U.S.
join it after Iran, Libya and Russia agree to participate the
convention.
</P>
<P>
A full Senate vote is scheduled on Thursday after debate on
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Imposes New Sanctions on Burma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Tuesday announced to ban new investment in Burma as fresh measures
to force the Burmese government to act in an accordance with U.S.
dictations.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released on Tuesday, Clinton said: "I have taken
this step in response to a continuing pattern of repression by the
State Law and Order Restoration Council in Burma."
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the move did not affect existing
investments there.
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
told reporters that Clinton made the decision because "the
repression by the Military authorities of the democratic
opposition in Burma has deepened," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
Details of the provisions, including the effect on
foreign-based subsidiaries of U.S. companies, were being worked
out, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Washington would try to persuade other countries to join it in
isolating Burma, Burns said at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We will be very aggressive, obviously, in talking to our Asian
and European allies and partners about this issue and hope that
they may follow suit," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has halted direct financial assistance and
blocked much international aid since the State Law and Order
Restoration Council took power in 1988.

<P>
NEW YORK, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
jumped to its second biggest-point gain ever today, rising to its
highest level in nearly a month, as long-term interest rates fell
back toward 7 percent in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow gained 173.38 points, or 2.6 percent, to 6,833.59. The
blue-chip barometer recouped 442 points so far this month.
</P>
<P>
Today's gain put the Dow above 6,800 for the first time since
late March and beat last Tuesday's 135-point rally, which had been
the biggest point gain since a 186.84-point jump two days after
the Black Monday crash of 1987.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by more than a 3-to-2
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 501.98
million shares, up sharply from Monday's 393.65 million.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 14.27 to 774.64, and
the NYSE composite index rose 6.44 to 405.84.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 8.79 to 1,212.74, but the
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 6.51 to 544.96.
</P>
<P>
The Dow still stands about 250 points shy of its all-time best
close at 7,085.16, set March 11.
</P>
<P>
Most broad measures also surged this afternoon as bonds rallied
after an encouraging auction of new Treasury securities.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices rose, the benchmark yield on the 30-year
Treasury bond fell to 7.04 percent. A week ago, the long-bond
yield rose to a nine-month high of 7.17 percent amid mounting
inflation jitters.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Issues Report Linking Environment with Diplomacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
today issued its first annual report on the environment, saying it
will place a priority on environmental issues in the country's
foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was piled up on a decision by former State
Secretary Warren Christopher to integrate the environment into
American foreign policy, said the U.S. will focus on climate
change, toxic chemicals, species extinction, deforestation and
marine degradation.
</P>
<P>
It said that regional hubs to promote environmental policies
would be opened this year in U.S. embassies in Costa Rica,
Uzbekistan, Ethiopia, Nepal, Jordan and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Issuing the 32-page report, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said that the U.S. seeks "an outcome in which the
industrialized nations who emit the largest amount of greenhouse
gases today will accept legally binding targets, and in which
developing nations...acknowledge their obligations for the
future."
</P>
<P>
"We will be placing a steadily increased priority on
environmental and related global issues in many of our key
bilateral relationships," she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the link between the environment and foreign
policy will enable the U.S. to have another tool like human rights
to play power politics and hegemony in the world.
</P>
<P>
The State Department issued annual report on human rights
blaming other countries except the U.S. itself on human rights
situation. The measure is widely regarded as a violation of
international norms since it interferes other countries' internal
affairs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Accuses Iraq of Flying Pilgrims Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States attacked
Iraq on Tuesday for its sending helicopters to pick up Muslim
pilgrims from Saudi Arabia, saying the move was "trying to pick a
fight" with the only superpower in the world.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Iraq flew several helicopters on Monday and
Tuesday over U.S.-enforced no-fly zone in southern Iraq to the
Iraq-Saudi border in an effort to ferry Iraqi citizens back from
last week's pilgrimage to the Muslim holy cities of Mecca dn
Medina in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The United States, irritated by Iraq's move in defiance of its
earlier warning not to do anything provocative, said it would not
tolerate any "violation" by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein of U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"What Iraq seems to be doing is engaging in a high-wire act of
political provocation. They're trying to pick a fight," State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a regular news
briefing.
</P>
<P>
"He (Saddam) shouldn't test the resolve of the United States,"
Burns said. "Any type of military provocation, of course, will not
succeed because the United States and our allies will continue to
enforce the no-fly, no-drive zones."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Bill Clinton told reporters at the White
House before leaving for the Midwest that the United States would
"continue to observe the no-fly zone and continue to support the
embargo until he (Saddam) lives up to the conditions of the United
Nations resolutions."
</P>
<P>
"We support people in exercising their religious liberties and
in living out their religious convictions everywhere in the
world.... But we don't want to see religion, in effect, used and
distorted in a way to try to avoid the international obligations
that are imposed," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters there
had been no change in U.S. policy regarding the no-fly zone, but
he admitted Iraq was not mobilizing its forces to confront the
United States and its allies.
</P>
<P>
"We can discriminate between relatively small-scale
humanitarian operations and large-scale military movements," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Nizar Hamdoun, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, said in
an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. that his country
was not seeking a confrontation with Washington. He, however,
stressed that his country does not recognize the no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
"It is illegal. It has nothing to do with any Security Council
resolution," he said.
</P>
<P>
On April 9, Iraq flew 104 pilgrims to Saudi Arabia for the
pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, and the United States wanted the
U.N. Security Councils to condemn the flight as a violation of the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council issued a statement calling on Iraq
not to fly more planes without its consent, but stopped short of
terming the flight a breach of the embargo as the United States
had wished.
