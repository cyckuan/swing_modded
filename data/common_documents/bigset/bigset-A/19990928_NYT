   NEW YORK _ Darryl Strawberry left his house in Fort Lee, N.J.,
on Monday, drove to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in Manhattan
and continued to Yankee Stadium for a night game against the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry said that he begins each day with the one-hour
meetings and that they are the most important part of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to take care of myself first now,'' Strawberry said.
``That's what I'm most concerned with.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been 28 days since Strawberry was recalled from Class AAA
Columbus to give his crumbling career one more chance with the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   When the 37-year-old Strawberry rejoined the Yankees, General
Manager Brian Cashman discussed how the player needed to win a
post-season roster spot and Manager Joe Torre was vague about
Strawberry's future.
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious that the Yankees were not holding a spot for
Strawberry. He had to convince them that he was still a threat and
that his surgically repaired left knee was fit enough for him to
play three straight days. It took Strawberry about a week to prove
he still belonged, and now speculation about the post-season roster
includes Strawberry as a definite part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I proud of that?'' Strawberry said. ``The most important
thing for me was not being worried about it. When I got the
opportunities, I knew I'd show my abilities and what I could do.
You got to remember I've been in this game a long time. What most
people don't understand is I do not press. The way things turned
out, of course, I feel good about myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He should. After Strawberry was arrested on charges of
possessing cocaine and soliciting a prostitute in Tampa, Fla., on
April 14, he was suspended from major league baseball for 113 days
and his career was placed in a tenuous position. But George
Steinbrenner showed silent support for Strawberry, who is making
his fourth comeback with the Yankees since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   With Ricky Ledee blossoming in left field, switch-hitter Chili
Davis entrenched as the designated hitter and Jim Leyritz as a
right-handed hitter coming off the bench, Strawberry had to show he
belonged. He has done that; entering Monday night's game, he had
reached base in 27 of 50 plate appearances and was batting .378
with two home runs, two stolen bases and five runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for him because, just a few months ago, he really
didn't know where he was going,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have to fight through the chemo and stuff that alters your
personality, I think it's a great story and I'm happy for him,''
Torre said of Strawberry's bout with colon cancer. ``He's been
terrific for me for the four years I've been here. I know he can
still get it going and still be a force at the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   It is incredible how Strawberry has crept into the lineup for a
team that had been in first place for weeks without him, although
Davis' prolonged slump has given Strawberry more opportunities.
Since Davis smacked five hits and had six RBIs against the Indians
on July 24, he is 27 for 144 (.188 average) with four homers and 13
RBIs and has looked like a weary 39-year-old. That is why
Strawberry, who was fighting simply to be a pinch-hitter a month
ago, will start some post-season games as the DH.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not thinking about it,'' Strawberry said. ``You play
the game with some knowledge and you know what you're supposed to
do. This is getting exciting now around here. This is when you want
to be out there. We're trying to get back to the Promised Land.''

STANLEY FLEISHMAN, 79, EXPERT IN FIRST AMENDMENT CASES
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (nk) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley Fleishman, a constitutional lawyer involved in several
noted First Amendment cases and an advocate for disabled people's
rights who was himself disabled by polio, died on Thursday at a
hospital in Los Angeles. He was 79 and lived in Beverly Hills,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The causes were pneumonia and complications from surgery, The
Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
   At his death, Fleishman had been a partner in the Los Angeles
law firm of Fleishman &AMP; Fisher and its predecessors for two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   His colleague David Grosz recalled that, beginning in 1957,
Fleishman argued 10 cases before the Supreme Court that involved
literary freedom. He also prevailed without argument in seven other
cases reviewed by the court.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Fleishman represented both Henry Miller, in his
fight against extradition from Los Angeles to Brooklyn to face
criminal obscenity charges for having written ``Tropic of Cancer,''
and Bradley Smith, a bookseller who had been convicted of selling
the book.
</P>
<P>
   In a noted 1957 case, Alberts vs. California, Fleishman lost,
but the Supreme Court's ruling made it clear for the first time
that the portrayal of sex in ``art, literature and scientific works
is not in itself sufficient reason to deny'' constitutional
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The court also said, in language that soon became famous, that
the proper test of obscenity was not the effect of isolated
excerpts on sensitive people, but ``whether to the average person,
applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of
the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his First Amendment battles, Grosz said,
Fleishman ``embarked on a quest,'' beginning in the 1970s, ``to
enforce the then-emerging statutory rights of people with
disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   His last appearance before the Supreme Court came in 1994 in a
child pornography case. He was the lawyer for the defendant, Rubin
Gottesman. In 1987, Gottesman, the owner of an adult video store in
Los Angeles, had sold to an undercover agent more than 100
videotapes featuring Traci Lords, an actress in adult movies whose
career had begun when she was a minor.
</P>
<P>
   The case provoked a spirited debate among the justices over how
the court should respond when faced with a carelessly written law,
which, if taken literally, might be unconstitutional. The
circumstances of the case raised two questions: Should the court
read the law in the way that Congress almost certainly intended but
did not quite say, or should the court teach Congress a lesson by
holding the lawmakers to their poor choice of words?
</P>
<P>
   A 1977 federal law, the Protection of Children Against Sexual
Exploitation Act, said that ``any person who knowingly transports
or ships'' a ``visual depiction'' of a minor engaged in sexually
explicit conduct faced up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco,
in overturning Gottesman's conviction, held that the law violated
the First Amendment because it did not require the government to
prove that a defendant knew that the explicit films showed
performers under the age of 18. The appeals court found that, from
its placement in the statute, the word ``knowingly'' applied only
to transporting or shipping a ``visual depiction,'' and not to
succeeding clauses about the performers' ages and the films'
nature.
</P>
<P>
   Fleishman argued that the appeals court had given the right
interpretation to a ``badly drawn statute.'' But Justice David H.
Souter replied that this ``grammatical point doesn't answer the
problem of meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   The court upheld the law in that case, but it also held that a
person charged under that statute must know both the age of the
performers and the material's sexual content.
</P>
<P>
   Fleishman was also active in cases involving the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 and earlier, related legislation, and near
the end of his life was collaborating on a suit to gain
accommodations so the disabled could easily ride Los Angeles buses.
</P>
<P>
   Fleishman was born in the Bronx, a printer's son. When he was 1
year old, polio left him without the use of one arm and of both
legs for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Queens, N.Y., and received his law degree in 1944
from Columbia University. He moved to Los Angeles in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Doris; three daughters, Sue and Bette
Fleishman, both of Tucson, Ariz., and Judy Fleishman of Haverhill,
Mass.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Diane Erickson, a model who was on the cover of Self
magazine's first issue in 1979 and who later became a fashion
photographer, died on Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in New York. She was 43.
</P>
<P>
   She died from complications from breast cancer, said Meg
D'Incecco, the public relations director of Self, a health and
fitness magazine for women.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Erickson acted in several films, including ``Jagged Edge''
and ``Runaway Train.'' After her cancer was diagnosed last year,
Ms. Erickson wrote a monthly chronicle of her fight against cancer
called ``Diane's Diary'' for Self.
</P>
<P>
   She also began to create a visual and literary record of her
life and was preparing it as a book with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Mason Flaine, chairman of C.R.C. Press, a specialized publishing
house, said he planned to publish the book when the friend
completed it.
</P>
<P>
   Born on May 24, 1956, in the Boston area, Ms. Erickson studied
photography at the State University of New York at Buffalo and
later worked with well-known fashion photographers.
</P>
<P>
   She was legally separated from her husband, Michael Charles. She
is survived by her daughter, Helena, of Manhattan; her mother, Mary
Helfer of Centerville, Texas; two brothers, John Erickson of
Cleveland and Thomas Erickson of Houston; and two sisters,
Christina Reid of Sugarland, Texas, and Jane Ashmore of Texas.  &QL;

HOMEOWNER RELEASED FROM JAIL AFTER VOLUNTEERS CLEAN YARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frances Jane Todd, the 76-year-old grandmother jailed for a
trashy yard, is out of the poky.
</P>
<P>
   For that she can thank Joe Rawie, a man she had never met.
</P>
<P>
   On a rainy Monday morning, Rawie sent his construction crew _
and a few borrowed workers _ to clean the woman's south Kansas City
yard. In a steady drizzle, they hauled off three dump-truck loads
of trash and debris. They trimmed trees, fixed windows and mowed
weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Todd was released about 5 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could see the moon, I would jump over it,'' said Todd,
who had been incarcerated at the Kansas City Municipal Corrections
Institution since Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Free Frances'' effort began when Rawie, 35, a construction
contractor from De Soto in Johnson County, woke up Monday and read
about Todd in The Kansas City Star.
</P>
<P>
   He also listened to radio station Q-104's Randy Miller, who put
out a call for volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Todd, who had a long history of property-code violations, had
been sued by the city. She lost the case, and 90 days later, with
the yard still trashed with old tires, boards and concrete blocks,
a judge found her in contempt and sent her to jail until the work
was done.
</P>
<P>
   Five adults who live at the house or stay part time _ a
daughter, a son, two grandchildren and a family friend _ had been
slow to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Rawie got on the phone to his crew members, who typically do not
work in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing something special today,'' he told them. Then he
called other contractors. D.F. Freeman Contractors of Shawnee
volunteered two tandem dump trucks and drivers. Shawnee Mission
Tree Service sent trucks and workers.
</P>
<P>
   By 8 a.m. the convoy was rolling. It soon arrived at Todd's
house on a narrow, tree-lined street in the Ruskin Heights area.
</P>
<P>
   The job took four hours. As the group worked, more volunteers
arrived to help.
</P>
<P>
   Rawie gave Todd's relatives a new lawn mower. And then, he said,
he gave them ``a little preaching.''
</P>
<P>
   He told them they should do more to take care of Todd, that they
should not take her for granted. Keep her yard mowed and trash
picked up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do this one time,'' he told them. ``I don't want to have
to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Vassey, the family friend who stays at the house, said he
and others helped with the work. Shirin McCormick, Todd's daughter,
offered thanks to everyone who wanted to help.
</P>
<P>
   Rawie started Blacktop Paving and Construction, based in Eudora,
Kan., four years ago. Business has been good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured it was time to give something back to someone who
needed a little help,'' said Rawie, who estimated the job cost him
$1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Don't call him a hero, he said. Plenty of other people would
have done the job had he not.
</P>
<P>
   From the number of telephone calls and e-mails received at The
Star, it appeared that Rawie was right.
</P>
<P>
   Contractors, social clubs, individuals, senior citizen groups,
college students and families called to volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Some were outraged at Holly Steinhauser, an assistant city
attorney, for pursuing Todd. But most blamed Todd's relatives for
not working harder to get her released.
</P>
<P>
   And some pointed the finger at Todd. It's about time the city
cracked down on those who do not keep their property clean, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City is a great place to live, and we all have to get
along,'' Martha Sharp said. ``Sometimes, it takes somebody like
Holly Steinhauser to come along and make tough choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd has promised to keep her place neater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do my darndest,'' she said.

NECK WOUND TO DOLPHINS' UNDERWOOD WAS SELF-INFLICTED
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOHN U. BACON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ The curious case of Dimitrius Underwood has
taken a stunning turn, with the police in Lansing, Mich., saying
Monday that the neck wound that Underwood, a Miami Dolphins
defensive end, sustained on Sunday was self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   Underwood is in Sparrow Hospital in nearby Lansing, where he
underwent surgery on Sunday, and his condition was listed Monday as
fair. Underwood's family in Fayetteville, N.C., requested that no
further information be released.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going through a real rough time, like any family would
at a time like this,'' said Lansing Police Lt. Raymond Hall, who
added that Underwood was cooperating with the police. Hall also
said the police relied on evidence and witnesses' statements to
determine that Underwood had cut his own throat.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said a woman in a car was yelling and pointing the police
to the 22-year-old Underwood, who was running down a street near
Michigan's Capitol, covered with blood from a knife wound to the
throat. The night before he had been arrested and jailed on a
charge of not paying child support for his 17-month-old twins.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's events were the culmination of a series of
incidents going back a year. Underwood, a 6-foot-6-inch, 276-pound
player with uncommon speed, had sat his senior season at Michigan
State with a less-than-serious ankle injury. After being a surprise
first-round pick of the Minnesota Vikings, he disappeared from the
team a day after signing a $5.3 million contract. He forfeited a
$1.75 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   He later signed with Miami for $395,000 but had not played this
season because of a shoulder injury. The Dolphins had a bye Sunday
and had granted their players time off until Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Underwood returned to Lansing, west of the Michigan State
campus, where the police arrested him about 7 p.m. Saturday on a
warrant for failing to pay child support to Chastity Dyer, the
mother of their twins, who live in Lansing. A few hours after the
police admitted Underwood to the Ingham County Jail in Mason, an
unidentified woman posted Underwood's $500 bond, but he wanted to
remain in jail.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ingham County Sheriff Gene Wrigglesworth, the woman
waited for about 45 minutes before leaving. About 11 p.m.,
Wrigglesworth said, he kicked out Underwood after finding him still
deep in conversation with a fellow prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Kay Van Ellis said Underwood was unfailingly polite.
About 11:45, the woman returned, and they drove off together, the
police said. It is not known whether it was the same woman who
alerted the police to the wounded Underwood the next day. And what
happened between 11:45 p.m. Saturday and 12:45 Sunday p.m., when
Underwood was found bleeding, is still being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson, who has a history of signing troubled
players, said Monday in a statement: ``I have talked to the nurses
there and have passed on the word that we are 100 percent
supportive of him. Our No. 1 concern is his health and well-being.
He is going through some difficult times right now, and we're with
him all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Underwood's coach at Michigan State, Nick Saban, offered similar
sentiments at his weekly news conference Monday. Yet, Saban added:
``We tried to help him last year. Dimitrius' behavior over a little
bit of time here has been unusual. I know that the Dolphins have
tried to help him now. He's a good person, and a good guy, who was
going through some hard times right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anything we can do to help him, I'd love to do it.
We just hope he gets better.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time Underwood quit the the Vikings, Saban said he had
told 14 National Football League teams that had contacted him about
Underwood's erratic behavior in college, which included unexcused
absences. The Vikings had not talked to Saban before the draft.
</P>
<P>
   After signing with Miami, Underwood showed up a day late, but
Johnson said: ``He had an excellent practice and without question
he's an excellent prospect. We had him rated as the top defensive
end in the draft, and nothing he did today makes us change our
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   When he walked out on the Vikings, Underwood said he was torn
between a desire to pursue the ministry and the need to support his
children. He never really explained why he decided to come back
with the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hard to say,'' he said in August. ``It's probably
like Einstein trying to explain the theory of relativity to you
guys. It'd take all day and you probably still wouldn't understand
it. I know I wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a higher power than money. The NFL's a great thing,
but you've got a higher power. Everything that wakes people up in a
day is not the same for everybody. Some people wake up for the
money chase. I wake up to a different beat. I wake up to the beat
of God. I felt like that's not where He wanted me to be at this
time, but, you know, I'm here.''

FREELANCE WRITERS WIN APPEAL IN COPYRIGHT SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to delete `Monday' from lede; ruling was actually Friday, as
now noted in 4th graf.)  (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a copyright decision that establishes the new
rules of the electronic road, a federal appeals court in New York
has ruled that three major publishers cannot include the work of
freelance contributors in electronic databases without the
freelancers' permission.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous ruling by the three-judge panel in the 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower court ruling that had
agreed with the arguments of New York Times Co., Newsday Inc. and
Time Inc. Magazine Co. and their co-plaintiffs, University
Microfilms International and Mead Data Central Corp., the former
owner of the Lexis-Nexis databases.
</P>
<P>
   The publishers had argued that the electronic databases like
Nexis were analogous to anthologies or other ``collective works''
that can be revised without the permission of the individual
copyright holders. But the appeals panel held that ``the privilege
afforded authors of collective works'' under existing law ``does
not permit the publishers to license individually copyright works
for inclusion in the electronic databases.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, issued Friday afternoon and concerning a lawsuit by
several freelancers, comes as online publishing is exploding and as
many publications are expanding and leaning on freelance
contributors to supplement the work of their regular staff. It
could force the companies to offer retroactive electronic-rights
payments for everything from opinion pieces submitted for op-ed
pages to full-length magazine pieces, and for photographs and
graphics. Alternatively, it could force the publishers to go into
their databases and pull out any freelance work covered by the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Recent work, however, is less likely to be subject to the
ruling, since a number of media companies, including New York Times
Co., Newsday and Time Inc., have for several years required
freelance writers to sign contracts that allow electronic
republication of the work without additional compensation. Other
companies _ it is unclear how many _ have not, relying on contracts
that make no mention of electronic rights or handshake agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the decision on media companies could be
``devastating,'' said E. Leonard Rubin, a former general counsel at
Playboy Enterprises who now heads the intellectual property section
at the Chicago law firm of Gordon &AMP; Glickson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publications that have hastened to take advantage of the
electronic age, and have an incredibly vast inventory of
interesting articles and works of fiction, and wanted to post them
on their Web sites and in databases for the sake of researchers,
are now going to have to go back to their databases and make
adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be incredibly expensive and time-consuming,''
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Judge Ralph Winter, writing for the three-judge panel that
made the ruling, held that ``there is no feature peculiar to the
databases at issue in this appeal that would cause us to view them
as `revisions.' Nexis is a database comprising thousands or
millions of individually retrievable articles taken from hundreds
or thousands of periodicals. It can hardly be deemed a `revision'
of each edition of every periodical that it contains.''
</P>
<P>
   While the case refers specifically to publication of material on
electronic databases, lawyers involved in the case said it would
almost certainly apply to publication of material on Web sites as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue of technology outpacing the law of
contracts,'' said Elizabeth McNamara, who specializes in copyright
law. ``Arguably, each individual freelancer will be able to go to
the publisher and say you've got to compensate me.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinions on copyright law from the 2nd Circuit, copyright
experts say, are given widespread deference around the country
since so many copyright cases are litigated here in the unofficial
capital of the media industry. Lawyers for the three publishers
said Monday that they were studying the decision and had not yet
decided whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   George Freeman, an assistant general counsel for New York Times
Co., said Monday, ``Certainly in the case of The New York Times,
our complete record is a historical archive. If one takes this
decision at its word it would seem to require, absent an agreement
with the freelancers, that we delete articles that were part of
that historical record.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``This opinion's effect appears to be tampering with
the historic record. That is very problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Tasini, the president of the National Writers' Union
and the lead plaintiff in the case, was jubilant Monday at the
panel's decision to overturn the U.S. District Court ruling by
Judge Sonia Sotomayor. ``Every single data provider now is at risk.
We could go into court tomorrow if we wanted and ask to shut down
every database.''
</P>
<P>
   In letters the writers' union sent to 22 publishers Monday,
Tasini argued that the ruling ``potentially puts your company at
great financial and legal risk.'' But, the letter added, ``we want
to emphasize that neither the NWU nor the freelance writing
community is seeking to undermine the distribution of magazine and
newspaper articles via online networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the letter urged widespread adoption of a licensing
system that would allow publishers to obtain electronic rights to
works through the Publication Rights Clearinghouse, a group that
already handles licensing issues for some writers. The result,
Tasini said, would be a system analogous to that operating in the
music industry, in which organizations like BMI and ASCAP license
the use of music by anything from dance studios to high school
musical productions.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the American Society of Magazine Editors said
Monday that they had not had time to review the decision and could
not comment on it until they did. And lawyers for the publishers
pointed out that the appeals court sent the case back to the
District Court with orders to craft a final order. ``Of course as
you know we don't have an order yet, so we don't know the precise
contours of our obligations,'' said Robin Bierstedt, the deputy
general counsel at Time Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Felch, the lawyer for Tasini and the other writers,
disagreed, saying ``the opinion is the opinion,'' and the order
could not modify it, only follow it.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the lawyers involved in the case said, the decision
will give freelancers the ability to negotiate richer contracts. As
Rubin pointed out, since the Web knows no geography, electronic
rights are tantamount to worldwide rights. ``Worldwide rights
always cost more than domestic rights,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But in practice, as Rubin and other experts noted, publishers
usually can set their own terms. ``If, in fact, many writers like
to think of themselves as starving, they'll capitulate to the new
terms. Important writers won't.'' Nonetheless, he believes that
publishers may well find themselves readjusting their contract
scales upward as a result of the decision.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Most publishers started selling their archives to databases like
Lexis-Nexis or Dow Jones Interactive in the early 1980s. Lexis and
Nexis were owned by Mead Data Central when the lawsuit was filed in
1993, but in 1995 were sold to Reed Elsevier PLC, a British-Dutch
conglomerate, which paid $1.5 billion for the electronic legal and
news retrieval business.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tasini said in a telephone interview Monday, ``Way back when
this first started they should have been smart and come to writers
and asked permission. Now it's going to cost them more, because
they were arrogant and walked all over us and didn't bother to ask
permission.''
</P>
<P>
   But several lawyers for the publishers said that the statute of
limitations on copyright violation lasts only three years; if the
copyright violations were said to have occurred only when the
material was first put into a database, in many cases writers would
have lost their chance to file a complaint.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; SAN FRANCISCO _ No one was hated more at Candlestick Park than
Tom Lasorda. No one loved it more.
</P>
<P>
   In his 20 years as Dodgers manager, Lasorda was a carnival
barker at one of baseball's greatest sideshows, blowing kisses at
the harsh winds and angry mobs that are as much a part of the place
as Mays, McCovey and Marichal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's is the only Italian I ever knew who was booed in San
Francisco,'' said the late Dolph Camilli, onetime Dodgers first
baseman and Bay Area lifer. ``They loved to hate him here. He was
the perfect villain.''
</P>
<P>
   So perfect, in fact, that the Giants have asked him to return
Thursday at the end of the club's three-game series with the
Dodgers to help say goodbye to the 'Stick, which is closing for
baseball after 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda will make one last walk from the visiting clubhouse in
the right-field corner to the Dodgers dugout, where he clinched a
title in 1977 and so painfully lost one in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Let the record show that the Dodgers were 180-160 at the stadium
now called 3Com Park. Since 1960, they won eight pennants to the
Giants' two. But more often than not it wasn't about the numbers.
It was the sweet but often bitter differences between North and
South that began in the Polo Grounds and Ebbetts Field and
continues from the South Bay to Sausalito.
</P>
<P>
   It was wrapping yourself in a sleeping bag in July to stay warm.
It was watching Bill Russell's cap fly off at shortstop and stick
to the outfield fence. Or Reggie Smith and Davey Lopes climbing
into the stands after getting hit by chicken bones.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you don't remember the name Mike Ivie, but here they
remember his pinch grand slam off Don Sutton in 1978 that kept the
improbable Giants in first place for one more day.
</P>
<P>
   There was a morning Old Timers Game between Dodgers and Giants
of the '70s that was played with an intensity that no one has seen
since, well, since the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Vida Blue was throwing 90 and Dusty Baker, now the Giants
manager but still looking right in a Dodgers uniform, took him
deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked me to take one more walk and blow kisses to the
fans,'' Lasorda said over the weekend. ``I think it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how many Pac Bell Parks they build here in homage to
the future, Candlestick always will represent memories that won't
fade even when the fog rolls in.
</P>
<P>
   Here are one man's 10. You might have 10 others. That's the
beauty. &QL; 
MORGAN'S HOME RUN &QL; 
Oct. 3, 1982
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had been eliminated the day before and knocking out
the Dodgers became the year's highlight. The Dodgers had rallied
from way back to catch the Atlanta Braves, but now they were
stumbling. In the last Dodgers games for Steve Garvey and Ron Cey,
future Hall of Famer Joe Morgan hit a three-run homer off
left-hander Terry Forster in the seventh inning to win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've hit some pretty meaningful home runs, but the one I hit
to beat the Dodgers was right up there. One of the top two or three
in my career,'' said Morgan, a Bay Area native who grew up rooting
for the Giants. ``It meant so much to the Giants and their fans to
beat the Dodgers that day.'' &QL; 
MAYHEM &QL; 
Aug. 22, 1965
</P>
<P>
   The tension of a tight pennant race spilled over into violence
when Giants pitcher Juan Marichal struck Dodgers John Roseboro in
the head with his bat in the third inning after claiming the
catcher had nicked his ear throwing the ball back to the catcher. A
14-minute, on-field brawl ensued and police were also summoned to
restore order among the Candlestick crowd of 42,807.
</P>
<P>
   What made it more dramatic was that Willie Mays, who acted as a
peacemaker during the brawl and even wiped blood from Roseboro's
forehead, came back to hit a game-winning home run against a
flustered Sandy Koufax.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can thank Mays that there wasn't a real riot,'' Dodgers
outfielder Lou Johnson said. ``If not for him, it would have been a
lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Marichal was suspended for nine days and fined $1,750. He later
was sued by Roseboro, who received a $7,500 settlement. &QL; 
WATERED-DOWN WILLS &QL; 
Aug. 12, 1962
</P>
<P>
   Maury Wills was in the midst of his MVP season when he recorded
a then-record 104 stolen bases. The Dodgers came in with a 5{-game
lead over the Giants but got swept in three games. One reason: The
Candlestick grounds crew watered down the basepaths so severely
Friday and Saturday that it almost was unplayable. Wills was
grounded and got so angry he was ejected for Saturday's game for
arguing with the umpire about the condition of the field. Sunday,
the umpires insisted the grounds crew add sand, which made
conditions worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a cold from that day,'' Wills said last week at
Dodger Stadium. During batting practice ``We went into the
clubhouse and someone came in saying, `You guys have to see what
they are doing to the field. We went out and saw the grounds crew
without nozzles hosing down spots on the infield for three four
minutes at a time.'' &QL; 
MARSHALL FREAKS OUT &QL; 
April 21, 1987
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were on their way to a National League pennant, their
second since coming to San Francisco. The Dodgers, even with Pedro
Guerrero back from missing most of 1986 with knee surgery, were
going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   But the rivalry showed its intensity _ and ugliness _ when
Giants manager Roger Craig ordered pitcher Scott Garrelts to walk
Guerrero to pitch to Marshall. Marshall hit a three-run homer into
the left-field stands to break an 8-8 tie, but he didn't stop
there. As he rounded the bases, Marshall taunted Garrelts and
pointed sharply at the Giants dugout.
</P>
<P>
   When he touched home, Marshall waved his arms at Craig. Alex
Trevino, the next Dodgers batter, never stood a chance. Garrelts
threw at his head, touching off a bench-clearing brawl. Several
Dodgers went into the stands after fans and dozens of arrests were
made. ``I didn't mean to cause a riot,'' said the usually quiet
Marshall, ``and I didn't mean to get Alex thrown at. Looking back
at it, I wish I hadn't done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his decision, Craig said, ``Mike Marshall is not a
pimple on Pedro Guerrero's butt.'' &QL; 
BEGINNING OF THE END &QL; 
Sept. 18, 1997
</P>
<P>
   Many think the beginning of Bill Russell's demise as Dodgers
manager can be traced to the day reserve Giants catcher Brian
Johnson hit a 12th-inning homer off left-hander Mark Guthrie and
shattered the season's momentum.
</P>
<P>
   After a second-half rush moved the Dodgers into first place,
they were tied with the Giants with nine games to play. They
finished second, two games back. Guthrie had been one of Russell's
most consistent relievers but was fading in September, finishing
the month with a 23.14 ERA. Johnson, a fastball hitter, hit a
fastball down the middle into an impossible wind, but the ball
carried into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big moment in my life,'' said Johnson, who has
played little since.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the homer, Russell is better known for two questionable
strategy moves that might have cost his team a chance to win. The
first was not pinch-running for Mike Piazza after he singled to
open the 10th. The Dodgers got three hits that inning but didn't
score. Giants closer Rod Beck struck out Todd Zeile. Then Russell
let slow-footed pinch-hitter Eddie Murray come to the plate. Murray
grounded into a double play and the threat was over. Less than a
year later, so was Russell. &QL; 
GREATEST GAME EVER &QL; 
Sept. 28, 1986
</P>
<P>
   That was the headline the next day in the San Francisco
Chronicle after an otherwise meaningless late-season game went 16
innings and lasted 5 hours, 45 minutes before the Giants won 6-5 on
a Bob Brenly RBI double. The Dodgers used a major-league-record 27
players, including nine pitchers. The Giants went with 25,
including pitchers Jeff Bockus and Randy Bockus in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sax, closing in on Montreal's Tim Raines for the NL
batting title, went 0 for 7 to end a hitting streak at 25 games.
The Giants scored two runs in the bottom of the ninth to tie, and
both teams scored two runs in the 14th.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Minton, the winning pitcher, doubled in the 16th with two
outs. Brenly followed with a double and Minton, who was carrying
quite a paunch that season, thought he was going to have to take
out catcher Mike Scioscia at the plate. Scioscia stepped aside.
``There was no way I was going to leave this game,'' Minton said.
``It was my entire season.'' &QL; 
MAYS SETS NL RECORD &QL; 
May 4, 1966
</P>
<P>
   Willie Mays had been a dead pull hitter in New York because of
the 260-foot left-field wall in the Polo Grounds. But when he got
to Candlestick, strong winds made it impossible for a right-handed
power hitter. Against Dodgers left-hander Claude Osteen, Mays went
the other way and broke Mel Ott's National League record by hitting
his 512th career homer. He finished with 660, third all-time.
``What a relief it was,'' said Mays, who went 3 for 23 after
hitting No. 511 a week earlier in Houston. ``I never thought it
would come.''
</P>
<P>
   Osteen, now the Dodgers pitching coach, remembers it well: ``I
threw him a high changeup away and he hit it off the right-field
foul poll. No one took advantage of that wind the way Mays did. . .
. He was a pull hitter on the road and an opposite-field hitter at
home.'' &QL; 
TOMMY'S FIRST TITLE &QL; 
Sept. 21, 1977
</P>
<P>
   Tommy John pitched a six-hitter and Rick Monday hit an
upper-deck home run. But make no mistake. This 3-1 victory over the
Giants that clinched the National League West belonged to
first-year manager Tom Lasorda. As his players, many of whom he had
managed in the minors, sprayed him with champagne in the postgame
clubhouse, Lasorda bellowed, ``How sweet it is, how sweet it is.''
</P>
<P>
   It was particularly sweet because the Dodgers had unseated their
powerful rivals, the two-time World Series champion Cincinnati Reds
to win the Western Division. As he hugged John, Lasorda told him he
would be starting the NL playoffs against Philadelphia. Two years
earlier, John's career appeared to be over when he underwent
radical reconstructive surgery on his left elbow, a procedure that
now bears his name. He did not get along with manager Walter
Alston. Then along came Lasorda, who held the job for 20 years. &QL; 
REUSS' NO-HITTER &QL; 
June 27, 1985
</P>
<P>
   If the tradition of not talking during a no-hitter was going to
be broken, it was going to happen in Candlestick. Left-hander Jerry
Reuss, a high-ball pitcher and 14-game loser the year before when
he came over from Pittsburgh for Rick Rhoden, had not allowed a
basehit after six innings. It was then that a fan crawled over the
top of the visiting dugout and yelled, ``Way to go Jerry, you've
got a no-hitter going. Keep it going.''
</P>
<P>
   Reuss did, with a first-inning, throwing error by shortstop Bill
Russell keeping it from a perfect game. On the final out, former
Dodger Billy North tapped back to the mound and Reuss threw to
Steve Garvey. Reuss won 18 games that year, including six shutouts.
He also made the All-Star team headed by his former Pittsburgh
manager Chuck Tanner. But the no-hitter was the highlight, even if
someone tried to jinx it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time I leave that guy any passes,'' he said. &QL; 
HIDEO NOMO'S FIRST START &QL; 
May 2, 1995
</P>
<P>
   Never was a visiting player cheered at Candlestick the way Nomo
was, the first Japanese-born player to pitch in the big leagues in
30 years. And though he didn't figure in the decision, lost by the
Dodgers 4-3 in 15 innings, Nomo's presence and whirling pitching
motion touched off an international sensation. He allowed no runs
and just one hit in five innings before scores of Japanese flags
among the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The game was televised back to his native Japan, where thousands
of citizens watched on big screens posted in large cities even
though game time was 4:30 a.m. Nomo went on to win 13 games and be
named National League Rookie of the Year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 28:
</P>
<P>
   Russia's bombing of Chechnya has been advertised by Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev as a plan to ``eliminate the bandits''
terrorizing Russian apartment dwellers and to create a zone of
Russian security around Chechnya. It is a risky battle plan _ a
pursuit of Islamic militants in the Caucasus that threatens to
create political and military havoc not only in Chechnya but in
Moscow as well.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, terrorists have killed almost 300 people,
setting bombs in apartments in Moscow and southern Russia that have
killed innocent people as they sleep. This has provoked demands for
swift action, but caused some alarming overreaction, including the
detention of thousands of dark-skinned Moscow residents in the
search for the few Islamic militants believed to be behind the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Now the pursuit of terrorists has led to the bombing of Grozny
and other areas of Chechnya, raising questions about whether the
Russians are bombing for political reasons or as a kind of
eye-for-an-eye revenge. If the military could really pinpoint
terrorist nests, this bombing might be worth the effort. But many
of these militants, who also range into neighboring Dagestan, are
scattered through the mountains, not in the main city of Grozny.
Unlike the bombing of Belgrade, which Russians are mistakenly using
for comparison, bombing Grozny is not necessary to bring the
government to the table. Aslan Maskhadov, the moderate leader of
Chechnya, is already urging talks. Unfortunately, Russia's prime
minister, Vladimir Putin, has said he sees no use in such a meeting
at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of routing terrorists, Russian bombs and Russian troops
sealing the Chechen borders could undermine Maskhadov's efforts to
control the chaos spreading in his country. Moreover, the Russians
might not find the West as tolerant about a second Chechen war,
after a 1996 peace agreement that gave the country de facto
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier Chechen war and the peace agreement are a source of
deep anger in some segments of Russian society, in part because of
the shock at seeing the once-mighty Soviet military reduced to
incompetence. This new round of bombing, sadly, is far more
popular. With parliamentary elections in December and a
presidential vote set for next year, a second Chechen war may be
designed to give the illusion of power to a weakened Russian
government. But the first one, as many Russians and Chechens know
well, was one too many.

EDITORIAL: HOME FINANCING FOR THE CLINTONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 28:
</P>
<P>
   President and Mrs. Clinton have reportedly given up on the idea
of financing the purchase of their new house in Westchester County
with a $1.35 million loan guarantee from Terry McAuliffe, a
Democratic fund-raiser who has raised millions for the Clintons'
legal defense fund and the presidential library. The step may not
do much to restore Clinton's record for financial appearances, but
it is a smart move for Hillary Rodham Clinton. By securing a normal
commercial mortgage, Mrs. Clinton can assure New York voters that
if elected to the Senate, she would be acting for their good rather
than for that of financial benefactors.
</P>
<P>
   As Don Van Natta Jr. of The Times reported on Saturday, the
Clintons turned to McAuliffe for this singularly personal favor
after former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and two former White
House chiefs of staff, Thomas McLarty 3d and Erskine Bowles,
declined to help. These former Clinton aides did the Clintons a
favor by not getting involved in their personal finances. Critics
of the arrangement with McAuliffe have questioned whether it
complies with the letter and spirit of federal gift and campaign
contribution laws. A tone-deaf White House has defended the deal
with technical legal arguments that miss the real point.
</P>
<P>
   By its very nature, such largess compromises the dignity and
integrity of the office. No sitting president should accept loans
or any other form of personal financing from anyone other than
close relatives or institutional lenders. The fact that former
President Reagan allowed wealthy friends to buy a house for him
while he was still in office was a regrettable precedent, not an
example to follow.
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Clinton, renouncing the McAuliffe loan would be smart
politics. It would give voters fatigued by the Clintons' odd
propensity for scandal a heartening signal that, on her own, she is
ready to break from the ethical sloppiness of the Clinton White
House. A straightforward mortgage with no special favors would
allow her to start her New York residency with a cleaner slate.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
CINCINNATI _ It's another day in the heat of the playoff race, but
you would never know it by the atmosphere in the Cincinnati Reds'
clubhouse.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aaron Boone is cavorting through the room with his pants pulled
belly-button high, walking a walk that seems to belong in a skit
from Saturday Night Live. Only it's Sunday afternoon, and there's a
fairly important baseball game to be played.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pudgy reliever Dennis Reyes is flexing his muscles in
the direction of a teammate, who in his best Austin Powers voice
says, `Nah, baby!' Hans or Franz he is not.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the Reds return to their clubhouse to celebrate
another dramatic victory. The hero of the day answers to the name
Pokey.
</P>
<P>
   What a bunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``From top to bottom, this is probably the loosest group I've
ever seen,'' said Reds general manager Jim Bowden, whose
personality fits that of the team he has built into a contender.
``I really believe that's the character of the manager, the coaches
and the 25 guys.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it would appear the Reds aren't taking their
improbable jaunt toward the playoffs too seriously, and why should
they? Few took them seriously back in spring training when they
fashioned themselves as playoff contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, they have everyone's attention, and they'll
have a national stage under the big top tonight when they open a
critical two-game series at the Astrodome. The Reds have won seven
of their last nine games, including five in a row, to pull into a
tie with the Astros atop the National League Central. On Monday,
they rallied from a five-run deficit to beat the Cardinals 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all like kids in a candy store,'' Reds first baseman
Sean Casey said. ``It's awesome because of the magnitude of every
game. Every day you come to the park is like the first week of the
season _ so exciting. Everyone is fired up. This is what you play
for.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Reds have been enjoying the sweet taste of victory
over and over again, the Astros have been having candy taken from
them as if they were babies, losing six of nine games on a
tummy-aching road trip to St. Louis, Pittsburgh and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   And the Mets, whom the Reds were chasing for the wild card, went
on a six-game losing streak and have surrendered the driver's seat
in that race to the Reds _ and the Astros, who may have to settle
for the wild-card berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw this team being very competitive in the Central
Division,'' shortstop Barry Larkin said of his preseason assessment
of the Reds, whose last postseason appearance was in 1995. ``What
does that mean? In the past, playing .500 meant you were close to
winning this division. As an organization, we have nothing to lose.
As ballplayers, we have a chance to do something really special
here, and if we don't get it done, it would be frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin's personal frustration was an issue over the past two
years, and it reached the point that he didn't know if he wanted to
remain with the team through a rebuilding process.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew the Reds would retool so quickly?
</P>
<P>
   Through some shrewd moves and clever evaluations, Bowden _
working on a shoestring payroll _ added players such as Casey, Greg
Vaughn, Denny Neagle, Juan Guzman, Mike Cameron and Michael Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   The Casey trade is last year's news, but the other maneuvers are
enough to make Bowden the front-runner for Executive of the Year,
an honor that went to Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength of this team is how well we came together so
quickly,'' third baseman Aaron Boone said. ``Early on, you could
see that this was a team that comes to play every day and a team
that plays unselfishly. If you add those two ingredients to some
talent, you have a chance to do well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have surprised a lot of other people, but we haven't
surprised ourselves. We're having a lot of fun right now. The
importance that each day brings is nice. Win or lose, it seems like
tomorrow is even more important. That makes it a lot of fun to come
to the yard every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on the days when it's not so fun to be at the ballpark,
veteran leadership has prevailed. Bowden recalls a day earlier this
season when some of the players thought it was too hot to take
batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vaughn grabbed his bat and started heading out there, and they
all followed him like little puppy dogs,'' the general manager
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds also follow the leadership of their manager, a
68-year-old, cigar-smoking baseball lifer whose ability to relate
to today's young players was questioned in some quarters. The
answer to that question can be found in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   Colorful skipper Jack McKeon has presided over the Reds' rise on
the field, creating a loose environment that has his team bringing
an almost carefree attitude to the Astrodome tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is on them; it's not on us,'' McKeon said,
referring to the Astros. ``Everyone expected them to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, few expected the Reds to be playing meaningful games
in the last week of the season, but their remarkable run has almost
everyone rooting for the underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense that a lot of people around the country are
pulling for us, and that's nice to see,'' Boone said. ``Everyone
loves the underdog, but at the same time we don't feel like
underdogs. We feel like we can play with all of (the playoff
contenders).
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what happens, we're proud of the year we had.
But every man on this team would be extremely disappointed if we
didn't make the playoffs. Anyone who thinks we're just happy to be
going out there is dead wrong. That's not the case at all. We want
to get to the playoffs, and if we continue to play well, we'll get
there.''

UCLA'S PAUS LIKELY TO PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The beleaguered Bruins received both good and bad
news Monday, when they learned starting quarterback Cory Paus is
expected to play this week but tailback DeShaun Foster might not.
</P>
<P>
   Foster sprained his right ankle early in the loss at Stanford
but continued to play and rushed for 100 yards. The ankle swelled
overnight and he's questionable for Saturday's game at Arizona
State.
</P>
<P>
   Foster has been diagnosed with a high sprain (above the ankle
bone), which takes longer to heal than low sprains. Receiver Danny
Farmer suffered the same injury in training camp and missed three
weeks, but Foster's is not as severe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut feeling is he'll practice very little this week and
give it a try Saturday,'' head athletic trainer Geoff Schaadt said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Paus returned to practice after missing last week
because of bruised ribs he received in the Fresno State game. He
looked sharp, threw his usual tight spirals and is expected to
start against Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome,'' Paus said. ``I hadn't touched a ball in a
week, and I felt real good. It's a little painful when I throw
hard, but if we had to play tomorrow, I could.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sneezing still hurts. But I can brush my teeth, blow my nose,
drive and do all that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, second-string quarterback Drew Bennett injured his
right (throwing) elbow on the final play of the Stanford game _ it
was bent backward while in the throwing position _ and is
questionable. If Bennett can't play, sophomore Scott McEwan becomes
the No. 2 quarterback. If Bennett can't play and Paus re-injures
his tender ribs, McEwan becomes the starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get (McEwan) some more reps in practice,'' Toledo
said. ``We're also an injury or two away from (fourth-stringer)
Ryan McCann being the backup. We were so lucky for four years
because Cade (McNown) never got hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The injuries to Foster and Bennett come at a crucial time for
the Bruins (2-2, 0-1), who dropped from the top-25 rankings for the
first time in two years and must defeat Arizona State (1-2, 0-1) to
remain in Rose Bowl contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pivotal game for both teams,'' Toledo said. ``It's a
good game, a TV game. Basically, a bowl game's on the line. The one
that wins is in the hunt. The one that loses is out of the Rose
Bowl race. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to remain positive. We're a young team and they're
fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins can survive without Foster for a week or two because
Jermaine Lewis and Keith Brown are experienced, effective runners.
(Brown is from Phoenix and will have 55 friends and family members
at the game.)
</P>
<P>
   But the season hinges on the quarterback situation: Either Paus
plays the full game or Bennett improves his performance. He
completed 61 percent of his passes against Stanford but missed
countless receivers downfield. Farmer did not catch a pass and
Freddie Mitchell did not catch a pass in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bennett) knows the offense,'' Toledo said. ``He knows where
people are, but at times he doesn't find those people, he doesn't
pull the trigger. That's what's disappointing. It gets back to
potential and performance. Performance is what matters.''

EDITORIAL: A RUINOUS YEN POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 28:
</P>
<P>
   Masaru Hayami, governor of the Bank of Japan, tantalized Western
finance officials meeting over the weekend in Washington by hinting
that the bank would begin printing more yen _ a necessary step if
Japan is to pull itself out of a decade-long slump. But the
governor issued no firm commitments. Indeed, he even denied that
his words represented a change in policy.
</P>
<P>
   That is dismaying. Bank officials resist pumping up the domestic
money supply out of a remarkable fear of inflation. But Japan's
problem is the opposite _ deflation. Japanese prices have been
falling for years, and the longer they fall the more Japanese
consumers postpone buying until prices fall even further. That
downward spiral of prices and spending can become a recipe for
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Western economists have been hammering on bank officials to
reverse course and throw lots more yen into the economy.
Repeatedly, officials said ``no.'' Over the weekend, an optimist
could say, they at least changed the answer to ``maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese economy has stagnated for most of the decade,
growing at a trifling annual rate of about 1 percent recently. Adam
Posen, of the Institute for International Economics, notes that the
Japanese have finally adopted sound fiscal and financial policies.
They are running huge government deficits and clearing bad loans
off the books of commercial banks so they can start lending to
healthy companies again. But monetary policy remains dangerously
passive.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese bank officials say they are already running a loose
monetary policy, with short-term interest rates already within an
eyelash of zero. Even so, throwing more yen into Japan's economy
could stimulate output. The Japanese could use the new yen to buy
dollars, driving the value of the yen lower and making Japanese
goods cheaper to buy. That would stimulate exports. The bank could
also buy bonds and other assets, driving up their prices and making
consumers feel wealthier. That too could stimulate consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's bank officials appear genuinely confused about setting
policy in an era of deflation. But there are also signs of a
destructive turf war. Until last year, the bank took its marching
orders on monetary policy from the Ministry of Finance. Now it is
independent and appears jealously protective of its new
responsibility. Although Finance Ministry officials want the bank
to drive down the value of a soaring yen, the bank refuses to print
new yen.
</P>
<P>
   A rising yen is not so much of a problem by itself as it is a
symptom of a dangerously tight monetary policy. If Japan were
printing enough yen to keep domestic prices from falling, it would
also be printing enough yen to keep the yen from soaring on foreign
exchange markets. Hayami insisted that his pledge over the weekend
to ``respond appropriately and timely to developments in the
economy as well as financial markets'' represented no significant
change in policy. The frightening possibility is that he is
serious.

STRAIGHT TALK FROM A GAY PATRIOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investigators, prosecutors and officers for the most powerful,
most highly trained and most technologically advanced military
organization on the planet are expected to take four more months to
determine whether U.S. Army Reserve Lt. Steve May is a homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am,'' May says.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's investigation into May's sexual preference began back
in February, and continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told an investigating officer, this should be the shortest
investigation ever,'' May says.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the past year, military gumshoes have conducted
interviews, gathered evidence, studied documents, sifted through
rumor and innuendo, written reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's silly,'' May says. ``I never wanted to make an issue of
sexual preference or my own homosexuality. But now that it is, I
accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts within the military are now reviewing reports.
From there, recommendations must go up the chain of command for
approval. In May's case, there are at least four stops along the
way, with each commander having 30 days to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past year alone, roughly 1,200 military personnel have
been forced out under the `Don't ask, don't tell' policy,'' May
says. ``For the most part, these are qualified people who are
performing well, but happen to be gay, like me. That's the
absurdity of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   That, and the fact that the U.S. Military will spend almost a
year investigating something May already has admitted FOUR TIMES
within this article. And has said as much on national television
and in newspapers throughout the United States, including the ``New
York Times''. &QL; 
LASHES OUT AT COMMENTS &QL; 
May is a Republican member of the Arizona State Legislature. Last
February, during a debate on barring counties from offering
domestic-partner benefits to gay couples, May lashed out at
insulting comments by another representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an attack on my family, and attack on my freedom,'' he
said. ``My gay tax dollars are the same are your straight tax
dollars. If you are not going to treat me fairly, stop taking my
tax dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   (Note to any Army investigator reading this: That's FIVE.)
</P>
<P>
   That outburst got the investigation against him rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Far Right hates more than anything else is a positive
portrayal of an openly gay man (SIX),'' May says. ``To them, I'm
the greatest evil there is. I`m not what they want other people to
believe a gay person is. It frustrates them.''
</P>
<P>
   May has been been an Eagle Scout, a member of student
government, an ROTC member in college and an active duty soldier.
He's now a state legislator, a reservist, a conservative, a
Republican, a lightning rod.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are using the military to impose their social agenda on
the country,'' he says. ``They're afraid of treating gay people
fairly at the risk of normalizing homosexuality. The reality is,
gays are in the military, and always have been. That's not the
issue. The issue is letting us live our lives honestly.'' (SEVEN). &QL; 
`OPPORTUNITY TO DO GOOD' &QL; 
It isn't always easy. May lives in a state where legislators of his
own party have said homosexuality is ``undermining the natural
family'' and even compared it to ``bestiality, human sacrifice and
cannibalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are days when I wonder what I've gotten myself into,''
he says. ``But I've always felt compelled to contribute. I feel I
have an opportunity to do good.''
</P>
<P>
   Like pointing out the insanity of dropping qualified people from
the military when recruitment is so low experts believe we may have
to reinstitute the draft. Or wasting time and resources
investigating a 27-year-old reservist who performs his duties with
integrity and wishes only to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe attitudes are changing,'' May says. ``There's too
much work to be done to worry about something as stupid as sexual
orientation. I believe most people agree with that _ except those
who think I'm evil simply because I'm homosexual.'' (EIGHT). &QL;

LINCOLN TAKES OVER M'S HELM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The first order of business for new Mariners' chairman
and CEO Howard Lincoln is to prove to Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex
Rodriguez that the team's owners are committed to rebuilding a
playoff-caliber team by increasing payroll.
</P>
<P>
   In replacing John Ellis as the front man for M's ownership, the
shift in CEOs is seen as indication that majority owner Hiroshi
Yamauchi, president of Nintendo Co. Ltd. of Koyto, Japan, is
asserting more control over the franchise. It also comes at a time
when the ballclub faces some critical business decisions, including
the effort to re-sign Griffey and Rodriguez and replace Woody
Woodward as vice president of baseball operations.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln also is expected to put a face on an ownership group
that includes 15 other owners who have various interests in the
club, which was purchased from Jeff Smulyan for $100 million plus
$25 million in operating capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very much an obligation to enunciate not only the goals
of the ownership of the franchise but to take on the job of
answering the questions of the fans and the critics,'' Lincoln
said. ``I intend to be very active in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   First up is the effort to keep the Mariners' two superstars in
Seattle and playing in Safeco Field, which Lincoln said has
increased revenue and attendance to where the team can increase its
payroll from the current $54 million to between $65 million and $70
million next year. The budget will be locked in by Nov. 1, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will go in with the full expectation that payroll will be
going up in that range, and we will also go in with the full
knowledge that the ownership group has made definitive written
offers to both Alex and Ken that would make both of the players the
two highest paid players in the history of baseball,'' Lincoln
said.
</P>
<P>
   He won't make the numbers public, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I obviously think that both of those players are very
valuable,'' Lincoln said. ``But I am not going to negotiate the
Alex Rodriguez and Ken Griffey contracts in public. I'm not going
to posture about it either. I'm going to let the fans know what we
have done, and I think it's fair to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln said the actual negotiations would be handled by club
president Chuck Armstrong and whoever is hired to replace Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey downplayed whether an increase in club payroll would
affect his decision to re-sign with the M's.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I want to stay, I'm going to stay, whether the payroll's
$50 million, $80 million, $100 or $200 million,'' he said Monday in
Arlington, Texas, where the M's played the Texas Rangers. ``If I
don't want to stay, they can raise it to whatever they want. No
matter what they do, the decision is mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez declined to be specific about the team's offer but
said it was ``nothing that excited me. I'm not excited by dollar
signs. What excited me is bringing guys here I can play with for
the next several years. That's the motivating factor for me. This
wasn't going to excite me, no matter what the offer was.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said the offer was presented to him and his agent,
Scott Boras, at a meeting with Armstrong and Lincoln over the
weekend. He also said he prefers to wait until after the season to
discuss the matter with family.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging interview, Lincoln offered no apologies for
the owners' decision to try to recover $60 million of the $100
million in cost overruns from construction of the $517 million new
stadium. The Public Facility District that oversaw construction has
taken the position that the M's were responsible for all cost
overruns, while the ballclub wants to tap into excess revenue
derived from the taxes that were set up to pay the $372 million
public portion of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that it was appropriate to bring it to the attention of
the public before the opening of Safeco Field,'' Lincoln said of
the dispute. ``I'm well aware that this is an unpopular,
controversial cause. It's caused all sorts of upset among the fans,
the political leadership of the county and the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in my background, I'm used to fighting for unpopular
causes. I'm confident that when all of the facts are on the table,
the public's view of what happened here will be much different.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had requested that the cost-overrun dispute be put
to mediation. But the PFD rejected the move, and speculation is
that the M's will file a lawsuit to enforce their interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Concerning other front-office issues, Lincoln gave his vote of
confidence to the job that Armstrong has done in his 13 years with
the club, and said that Armstrong would be responsible for hiring a
replacement for Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not something that will be decided by the board of
directors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln joined Nintendo of America (NOA) in 1983 as its senior
vice president and general counsel and has seen the business
skyrocket during his tenure with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Because he's turning 60 next year, Lincoln wanted to step down
from his Nintendo responsibilities and take more of a role in
overseeing his other passion: the baseball team. He disclosed that
Nintendo's Yamauchi is now considered the majority owner after
major league baseball officials two years ago quietly removed a
restriction that limited his actual voting interest in the team to
49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The restriction, imposed when the club was purchased, was based
on fears from other team owners that baseball would be threatened
by a huge influx of foreign investment. Yamauchi actually paid $75
million of the original investment in the team. Lincoln's move to
CEO indicates he'll be the primary liaison between the team and its
majority owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm personally desirous of reducing the the amount of time I'm
spending with Nintendo, but I'm personally up to the challenge (of
being CEO) and something tells me this is going to be very, very
exiting and a difficult job,'' he said. ``I kind of like that, and
I think that I can pull it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln's ascension was lauded by American League president Gene
Budig, who called it a ``wise choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He replaces a person who has earned universal respect within
major league baseball,'' Budig said in a statement. ``It is
reassuring to know that John Ellis will continue to represent
Seattle on major league baseball's powerful Executive Council.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, 70, had hinted for several months that he was seeking to
take a less active role with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to complete the Safeco Field project and open the
magnificent facility for all the fans of the Pacific Northwest,''
he said in a statement Monday. ``With that done, I am ready to hand
over responsibility to Howard and help the Mariners in any way I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella, who has one year left on his contract, saw
the ownership move as helping to improve his ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel he's going to give the organization every opportunity
to succeed on the field,'' Piniella said. ``He's very interested in
making games at Safeco Field fan friendly, creating the best
experience he can for fans. And with it, naturally, comes the
fielding of a good competitive club that can contend.''

ACCOUNTABILITY AT LAST WITH NEW M'S CEO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ First, the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez?
</P>
<P>
   If turnover continues at this rate, Mariners fans by this time
next season will be calling Freddy Garcia ``old-timer.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it can be argued forcefully that there are in the
tepid Mariner bath water precious few babies.
</P>
<P>
   In other words: It's about bloody time.
</P>
<P>
   To the average Mariners fan, Monday's long-expected change at
CEO, in which Howard Lincoln takes over for John Ellis, may not
seem significant. And from a day-to-day basis in baseball, it
isn't, especially relative to the GM job.
</P>
<P>
   But from the standpoint of accountability _ something the
Mariners have had less of than middle relief or lefty hitting _ it
looms large. The endless loop finally ends.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up the question:
</P>
<P>
   Howard, are you nuts?
</P>
<P>
   ``I like a good fight,'' he said, smiling. ``I like a tough
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the Clanton brothers at the OK Corral.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln takes over at the point of highest tension in the club's
personnel history _ the pending free agency of Griffey and
Rodriguez, which is threatening to supplant the fate of salmon as
the Northwest's most over-talked, over-written subject.
</P>
<P>
   Besides that agony, Lincoln remains steadfast in ownership's
commitment to pursue tax money to cover $60 million of the cost
overruns on the Guilty Pleasure, a ploy that included holding
hostage the fates of Griffey and Rodriguez unless the demands were
met.
</P>
<P>
   As a lawyer, Lincoln is trained to defend unpopular causes. But
he would have an easier time as tobacco spokesman at Fred Hutch.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the owners and organization are better off with Lincoln
at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis was merely a front man, and not a good one. In his
defense, he had to carry a lot of bad water given him by others.
But his unapologetically confrontational style, coupled with his
insincere emotional manipulations, cooked his credibility in this
town.
</P>
<P>
   As with Ellis, Lincoln has only a tiny percentage of ownership.
But he directly represents the $75 million investment of the
uninterested Hiroshi Yamauchi, boss of Nintendo of Japan and pal of
U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton, official American benefactor to the Redmond
video-game maker.
</P>
<P>
   That means Nintendo gets the biggest say in club operations,
especially since major league baseball two years ago quietly
removed its xenophobic limit of 49 percent on the Japanese
investor's vote in ownership decisions.
</P>
<P>
   So Lincoln is the majority interest in the club, and thus on the
hot seat. But he's such a lifelong baseball fan, and so eager to
live out a dream from his Bay Area boyhood, that the Cal-Berkeley
law school grad is retiring in February from his lucrative power
base in high-tech to get figuratively hacked to bits by millions of
people convinced they know his job better than he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a dream come true,'' he said Monday. ``I'm not planning
to turn it into a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   How this job is anyone's dream probably explains baseball's
illogical lure as much as anything. As with many, Lincoln was
seduced when the Mariners charmed Puget Sound and much of baseball
in the fall of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would very much like to see us back to 1995,'' he said. ``My
feeling about that is that it wasn't just a great baseball season,
it really brought the community together in a way that I had never
experienced before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that will ever happen again, but I sure as
hell would like to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the dream moves toward the nightmare of Griffey and
Rodriguez, the M's must hire a GM. For that task, Lincoln gave an
unqualified endorsement to president Chuck Armstrong. With the
departures of Ellis and GM Woody Woodward, Armstrong is emerging
from the makeover as a much larger power broker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the organization is comprised of some very talented
people, starting with Chuck,'' Lincoln said. ``I have great
confidence in Chuck. I admire him, his work ethic and his
honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick will be for Armstrong to involve Lincoln, along with
Microsoft's Chris Larson, the largest minority partner, in the GM
selection without getting run over. Many in baseball will counsel
Armstrong that that camel will never stay out of the tent.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong already has allowed both to meet the first GM
candidate, Pat Gillick. The threat is that Lincoln and Larson, long
over their deference to wizened baseball seamheads, think they know
enough in seven years of ownership to make the call.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln assured his inquisitors that he had no intention to play
fantasy baseball with the Mariners, and that the Gillick meeting
was a get-acquainted informality.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he and his fellow owners once assured taxpayers that
they were picking up stadium cost overruns, no problem.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday was close enough to a first day on the job to draw
a courtesy pass, Lincoln rates the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, the law of averages says a guy's gotta keep a promise at
least once.

EDITORIAL: MISUSE OF DRUG TREATMENT RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 28:
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration's plan to use Medicaid billing
records to steer welfare applicants into drug and alcohol treatment
is a dangerous violation of medical confidentiality. Under the
proposal reported by Nina Bernstein in The Times, New York City's
Human Resources Administration would search its Medicaid payment
records for evidence that welfare applicants had in the past sought
drug or alcohol treatment. Applicants whose names turned up in the
records could then be forced into further drug treatment in order
to get or keep benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Federal laws prohibit the disclosure of information about a
patient's getting substance abuse treatment unless the patient
consents to its release, typically for specific purposes. But the
city thinks it can get around these rules because both the Medicaid
records and the welfare lists are kept by the same department. But
that specious argument ignores the fact that the billing records
were created for payment uses and were never intended to be used
for unrelated purposes years later.
</P>
<P>
   This abuse of confidential records is precisely what worries
privacy groups about the creation of large government data bases.
The plan could well deter people from voluntarily seeking drug
treatment if they believe that private records may be used against
them, if not in the welfare context, then in other circumstances.
Worse, there is no indication that such an egregious breach of
confidentiality would actually help welfare recipients get the kind
of treatment they need.
</P>
<P>
   The administrators say that this is a practical way to ferret
out substance abusers who might otherwise deny they have a problem.
But applicants are apt to deny their problems if they think that
the system will punish them for addiction. Welfare advocates say
that half of all people who are required to enter mandatory
treatment programs are cut from all welfare aid because they fail
to comply with program requirements.
</P>
<P>
   A large number fail because they cannot get appropriate
treatment. There are roughly 200 residential treatment slots in the
city for women with children. The administration should focus on
improving treatment options, not misusing confidential records.

DIVISION CHAMPIONS GET PAST GARCIA, M'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Mariners' last game in Texas was their
high point this year. They shut out the powerful Rangers, moving
their record above .500 at the season's halfway mark, and left town
in second place, five games back.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week, however, they had fallen to third, and they've
never risen higher. Last night, they returned to the Ballpark in
Arlington, which was freshly decorated with a ``1999 AL West
Champions'' banner above center field.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mariners scuffle to finish above .500, the Rangers are
trying to secure home-field advantage in the playoffs. They gained
ground in that effort with a 3-2 win over the Mariners last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew Texas had a good ballclub all along,'' Mariners
manager Lou Piniella said. ``They've got, what, six players with
100 RBIs, for God's sake, and their bullpen is pretty deep. They've
got some talent out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez, one of five Rangers with at least 98 runs batted
in, doubled and scored the first and third runs for the Rangers. In
the second, he came in on a double play grounder by Todd Zeile, and
in the eighth, he scored on a sacrifice fly by Lee Stevens,
breaking a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's eighth-inning double came with one out off Steve
Sinclair (0-1), who relieved Freddy Garcia. After an intentional
walk to Rafael Palmeiro, Jose Mesa walked Zeile to load the bases,
setting up Stevens' sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia worked seven innings, allowing two runs on nine hits and
lowering his earned-run average to 4.11, its lowest since April. He
lost a 2-1 lead in the sixth when MVP candidate Ivan Rodriguez
fouled off six pitches and grounded a single to left, scoring Tom
Goodwin from second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were holding the runner on with our shortstop, and that
created a hole,'' Piniella said. ``But, yeah, Ivan can swing the
bat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas catcher was Garcia's last batter an inning later. With
the bases loaded, Garcia induced a fielder's choice to end the
seventh. Piniella had come to the mound before the at-bat, and
Garcia convinced him he was not tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives me confidence,'' Garcia said. ``A pitcher needs
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also needs run support, and the Mariners' lack of it kept
Garcia from his 17th win, which would have tied a club rookie
record. The M's put baserunners on in every inning Texas starter
Rick Helling pitched, but they scored only in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Ibanez, whose ninth-inning homer won Sunday's Safeco Field
finale, lined a leadoff homer to right. It was Ibanez's eighth of
the year _ all in the second half _ and gave the M's a home run in
their club-record 19th consecutive game. The previous record was 16
games in a row, set in the miracle September of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Gipson followed with a triple, and scored on a one-out
sacrifice fly by Alex Rodriguez. A walk and a single put runners at
first and second, but Tom Lampkin flied out to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The M's also left a runner on second in the fifth. Ken Griffey
Jr. doubled after Helling struck out Shane Monahan and Rodriguez,
but the right-hander got Edgar Martinez looking to end the inning.
That was Helling's 10th strikeout, a total he last topped two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   WATSON IN: Former New York Yankees and Houston Astros general
manager Bob Watson was at Safeco Field on Monday to interview for
the Mariners' GM job. Watson is the second candidate to interview,
joining former Toronto and Baltimore GM Pat Gillick, who did so
last week.
</P>
<P>
   MOYER SHUT DOWN: The Mariners will finish the season with a
rotation of five rookies, since Jamie Moyer will miss his final
start of the year Thursday with shoulder soreness.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hinchliffe will start in Moyer's place Thursday. Robert
Ramsay, Freddy Garcia and John Halama are scheduled to start over
the weekend in Oakland, though Ken Cloude or Denny Stark could
start instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever it is, we're going to have five rookies in the
rotation,'' said manager Lou Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer, who led the AL with 228 innings prior to last night's
games, finished 14-8 with a 3.87 ERA. He attributed his soreness to
``wear and tear.''

RESEARCH FILLS LATEST BOOK ON KENNEDY  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - President John F. Kennedy in June 1963 went on
television without a script and asked White America to imagine life
as a Negro.
</P>
<P>
   It was the boldest statement ever by a White politician
determined to bring civil rights to all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Although the words were Jack's, the inspiration came from
brother Bobby.
</P>
<P>
   The anecdote offers a clue to the differences between the two
men _ one of style and acquired substance, the other a hardened
moralist unwavering in his passion for equality and justice, even
if that passion led to his own death and that of his brother.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``Sons &AMP; Brothers: The Days of Jack and Robert
Kennedy,'' former Arizona secretary of state and Kennedy scholar
Richard Mahoney explores the complex relationships in the Kennedy
family _ between brothers, between spouses, between the children
and their omniscient but loving father, Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedys were, and are, a family ``brilliant but greatly
flawed,'' Mahoney concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Several have paid for their mistakes with untimely deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the price of glory,'' Mahoney says.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade of research and writing went into the book,
says Mahoney, a friend of the Kennedys and scholar at the Kennedy
Library in Boston from 1987 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
   He compares the literary effort with an ``elephantine
pregnancy'' that happily resulted in a live birth. He also calls it
a ``strange marriage,'' then reconsiders the metaphor in light of
his five-year marriage to Phoenix area personality Mary Jo West, a
union that ended so amicably she worked diligently on his
unsuccessful race for the U.S. Senate in 1994 and remains, he says,
his best friend.
</P>
<P>
   They share custody of their 11-year-old daughter, Molly.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney, 47, who teaches at Thunderbird Graduate School of
International Management, long has been involved with the other
family in his life, the remarkable Kennedys. He met John Kennedy in
1961, when he was 9. He met Robert in 1967 and 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney's father, a friend of Robert Kennedy, served as
ambassador to Ghana during the Kennedy administration.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney began to write his book with trepidation, aware that his
work would be just the latest in a library that already includes
about 400 titles, including Theodore White's ``The Making of the
President,'' which created the Camelot myth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure where it was going or whether the world needed
another Kennedy book,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But he decided that he had something new to contribute to the
legacy, believing ``that we haven't closed the door on the Kennedy
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Every American, it seems, has been touched by the family in some
way.
</P>
<P>
   With one Kennedy book already to his credit, the 1983 ``JFK:
Ordeal in Africa,'' Mahoney began digging through documents to
explore topics he thought never had been addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Kennedy books fall into one of two camps _
assassination literature or literature about the administration _
he wanted to link the two with a balanced perspective that
portrayed the brothers and their father neither as wholly
scoundrels or unwavering saints.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional views sketched them as a political ``juggernaut,''
he says, united in their philosophies and ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   But there were contradictions, Mahoney found.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant contradiction was the question of the
Mafia, the role it played in Joe Sr.'s success and in the deaths of
his two sons.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Mahoney says, it becomes clear that the same
mobsters who helped win the election for Jack in 1963 instigated
his assassination three years later as the Kennedy brothers _
especially Robert _ moved to rid America of organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Killing the president was the way to stop his attorney general's
crusade against the mob, he says.
</P>
<P>
   But as Robert Kennedy doggedly pursued the cause he had begun as
chief counsel to the U.S. Senate's anti-crime McClellan Committee
in 1956, Mahoney says he was to discover Kennedy's own father's
involvement with the underworld, a relationship that had begun
during his bootlegging days in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of Joe Sr.'s capital might have constituted
ill-gotten gains and many of his acquaintances were hardly the
aristocrats that would characterize his own family, most of his
dealings were legitimate, says Mahoney, who admires the patriarch's
unwavering devotion to his children. He wrote each of them daily or
weekly letters of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   His nature was more like Bobby's than Jack's, Mahoney says.
Although Jack had style and charm ``almost in a global sense'' and
presented a more sanguine demeanor, Bobby's passions ran deep like
his father's. They loved and hated in the same way and shared an
``us against them'' outlook on life.
</P>
<P>
   The book explores the complex relationship between Jack and wife
Jackie, a flammable union fueled by love and chemistry that never
cooled, though Jack's philanderings threatened to destroy the bond.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it was Bobby, the family promise keeper, who helped shore
up the marriage. Mahoney calls him a ``tribalist'' for whom family
was paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Other revelations in ``Sons &AMP; Brothers'' include the efforts of
the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations to murder Cuban
President Fidel Castro, the role of U.S. intelligence agents in
those efforts as well as possible links to the deaths of both
brothers and the workings of anti-Castro forces in Miami then and
now.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney said he suspects that ``certain people in Miami'' will
not welcome his disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Kennedy came to office in 1961 with ``great
style,'' Mahoney says, but with questionable substance. By the time
of his death, he had grown into the job as a man of decisiveness,
especially when it came to civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of president would Robert Kennedy have been?
</P>
<P>
   ``Either great or disastrous,'' Mahoney surmises.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby would have assumed office with a great deal of experience
and power, but his radical ideas of how America had to change, to
ensure equality for all people, might have proven ill-timed and
contrary to an unshakeable status quo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, with the assassination of a second brother, the
question of that legacy is left unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedys were like a war machine, Mahoney says. They took
risks in battle. When one warrior fell, another stepped in to take
his place.
</P>
<P>
   The message: ``Life is brief. Death comes along sometimes in a
hurry. There's no need to be afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney's readers will see these men as ``heroic people who were
greatly flawed,'' who ``saw their deaths as creative acts of
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is a blood sport in which ``youthful death is the only way
to be eternal.'' &QL;

JURY AWARDS MORE THAN $40 MILLION TO WOMAN INJURED IN RAILROAD
CROSSING COLLISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Jackson County jury on Monday awarded more than $40 million to
a Sedalia, Mo., woman who suffered brain damage and more than 20
broken bones in a 1997 train-crossing accident.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors also found Union Pacific Railroad Co. liable for punitive
damages, which could add millions more to what lawyers say already
is Missouri's largest rail-crossing-accident verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific is 75 percent at fault, the jury decided, and
Amtrak 25 percent as the jurors awarded actual damages of nearly
$40.37 million. The jurors today will hear arguments in the
punitive damages phase in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Railroad attorneys declined to comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments, plaintiff's lawyers accused Union Pacific
of doing nothing to install lights and gates at the crossing a
quarter-mile south of U.S. 50 near Warrensburg, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff lawyer Grant L. Davis told jurors that 34-year-old
Kimberly Alcorn lived with pain ``like a window into hell'' because
Union Pacific waited instead of paying $200,000 for lights and
gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is about corporate greed,'' Davis said, ``It's about
putting dollars ahead of lives.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials had told the company 11 months before the Aug.
29, 1997, accident that the crossing was dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific waited for government subsidies to pay for
installing lights and gates, plaintiff lawyers argued. And the
railroad kept waiting, even after an Amtrak train hit a vehicle
there four months before the accident that disabled Alcorn.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers also cited testimony that Amtrak engineers did not apply
brakes until after the train hit the car Alcorn was in. The train
was traveling at 65 to 70 mph. The mother of two teen-agers
suffered brain damage, broken bones and disfiguring injuries, her
lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams, an attorney for the railroad companies, told
jurors: ``You can see a train if you look.'' Williams told them to
blame the accident on defendant Curtis Edwards, the driver of the
car hit by the train.

<P>
   Davis, however, told jurors to remember the state report that
said the view of the train was 90 percent blocked by brush and
terrain. He said to remember, too, the testimony of an assistant
Amtrak engineer who said he had narrowly missed several vehicles at
the crossing, including a propane truck.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney John Rollins represented Edwards, a friend of Alcorn's,
who was driving her back to Sedalia after they visited an
Independence mall.
</P>
<P>
   Rollins said that a sign which warned of a railway crossing was
in a ditch and that Edwards did not know he was approaching the
crossing, which had a faded crossbuck sign. Rollins cited the
testimony of several area residents who said that it was hard to
see a train even if they stopped and looked.
</P>
<P>
   Rollins said Union Pacific's attitude was ``we run the trains,
we make the money...but we're not responsible for safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury found that Edwards was not at fault, but that Union
Pacific had acted ``with complete indifference to or conscious
disregard for the safety of others.''

BIOGRAPHY OF `DUTCH' STIRS DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As a first-time visitor to Ronald Reagan's museum
and a longtime fan of the president, Dorothy McCallum had a stern
warning for the author of the long-awaited biography, ``Dutch: A
Memoir of Ronald Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He better write everything good. He was the best we ever
had,'' said the 77-year-old Whittier resident, who recalled
listening to Reagan call football games on the radio during the
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the release of the Reagan biography Thursday,
controversy is swirling around author Edmund Morris, the
Pulitzer-prize winning biographer of Theodore Roosevelt who has
been working on ``Dutch'' since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts in Newsweek and interviews with Morris have created a
stir about the book on at least two counts: Morris created
fictional meetings with the former president in his early years;
and he described Reagan as ``an apparent airhead,'' saying he was
``distressed by the relentless banality, not to say incoherence, of
the president's replies in interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like him mentioning that,'' said McCallum's brother,
Edward Dalton, 76, as he toured the Presidential Library and
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like anything, you're going to have some negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely lifted us up. We were suffering from Vietnam,
and he made people proud of America again.''
</P>
<P>
   While Morris wrote lovingly about the man who he said exhibits
``aggression without hostility, ego without vanity, superiority
without snobbery,'' he also referred to his ``encyclopedic
ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   Some at the museum understood how Morris reached that conclusion
after enjoying extensive access to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me he was never known for his intellect,'' said
Lorene Robbins, 62, of Winnetka, visiting the museum with her
husband and two friends from Denver. ``Nobody seemed to understand
his mind or his thinking process.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she hated to lose him as governor of California, but
called Reagan a ``mediocre'' president, saying ``there were many
that were much better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception was that he did better than he actually did,''
added her friend, Judy Butterfield, 61, of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Saucier, spokeswoman for the Reagan Presidential
Foundation, which funds the museum, said it has no official
position on the book, and has not decided whether to carry it in
the gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   That suits museum visitor Greg Voetsch Jr., 41, just fine. He
said he has no interest in the book, even though he admires the man
who he said brought down the Berlin Wall and elevated America
during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I want to read a biography about somebody, I want to read
about their life, not what the author wants to insert himself,'' he
said. ``I probably won't buy it, I won't read it.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Dachs, 60, and his wife, Monica, were visiting the museum
with their son, Dirk, a 34-year-old writer from Glendale. The
Dachses weren't familiar with the biography, but are such Reagan
fans that the museum was their only must-see in their three-day
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything he did was for the good of the country,'' Howard
Dachs said. ``What was Iran-Contra about? It was about fighting
communism, not his personal gain.''
</P>
<P>
   He also recalled a story about Reagan refusing to enter the Oval
Office without a coat and tie, to maintain its dignity, which Dachs
compared to President Clinton's ``dropping his pants in the Oval
Office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would sooner have Reagan in the White House with
Alzheimer's,'' he said, ``than what we have in there now, with his
disease.''

STRANGER'S CALL BRINGS DOG, PAL TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sound out of Clayton Briscoe's mouth ascended from the pit
of his soul. It was a guttural yell, one born of desperation and
terror, like from a mother watching her toddler running into the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buuuutttt-lerrrr,'' Briscoe hollered out.
</P>
<P>
   It was 4 a.m. on a Thursday in late August. Briscoe was
frantically jogging, walking, darting through his north Overland
Park neighborhood, up the streets, across driveways, through back
yards. He was bellowing at the top of his lungs, waking up the
neighbors and bawling his eyes out.
</P>
<P>
   His dog, a little Boston terrier, the love of his life, was
lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Butler!'' he shrieked. ``Where's my puppy?''
</P>
<P>
   He'd had that short-haired dog just three years. Got it when he
got married. His grandmother, uncle and aunt all had Boston
terriers. So Briscoe bought one, too. It was black with white
patches around the collar and on one paw. Its coat looked like a
tuxedo, thus the name ``Butler.''
</P>
<P>
   Briscoe took that dog everywhere, to stores, to parks, to
friends' houses, even on vacations. He taught that dog to howl when
he played the flute. He coached that dog to crunch a racquetball in
its mouth and shoot it out. Now Briscoe was going through a
divorce. That dog was his only child, his boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only thing I've got,'' Briscoe said. Now Butler was
gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buuuutttt-lerrrr.''
</P>
<P>
   This night had been one of the few times when Briscoe didn't
take the dog with him. He had gotten home to his duplex at 3 a.m.,
then let Butler out into the fenced-in back yard. A half-hour
later, Briscoe wondered why Butler hadn't come back in. He went out
to check. Butler wasn't around. And there was a hole dug under the
wood fence.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than the 26-year-old could handle. He broke down in
tears and burst out his door in the 7700 block of Kessler Street.
</P>
<P>
   The search continued for two hours. Briscoe caught an hour's
sleep, then was out again at 8 a.m., knocking on doors. No luck. He
came back in and called animal shelters, wondering what to do.
</P>
<P>
   One suggested he notify the Lost Dog Registry.
</P>
<P>
   He dialed the number. It rang into a small office in the Waldo
section of Kansas City.
Unrelenting grief
</P>
<P>
   Janice Martin unlocked the office door and sat at the lone desk.
A guide to America's dogs hung on one wall. A linen quilt of
pooches hung on another. A doggie-faced mug held her coffee.
</P>
<P>
   She had started the Registry, a lost-and-found dog
clearinghouse, 28 years ago. Now she was in her 60s and still
volunteering hours every day. This summer had been the busiest she
could remember. This day, Aug. 19, was typical. There were more
than two dozen messages on the answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   Martin turned on the play-back. A chocolate-colored Labrador had
jumped a fence. A golden retriever had turned up in someone's yard.
A Boston terrier had run away. On and on it went.
</P>
<P>
   After all these years, she had become almost numb to grief. She
started making calls, obtaining more specific information on the
dogs for index cards the Registry kept. She reached Briscoe that
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Martin heard him crying into the phone, sobbing and
talking at the same time, blubbering so much that she couldn't make
out what he was saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was about to cry with him,'' she said. ``I've never had a
gentleman so undone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Registry had a pretty good track record, even when a dog
didn't have a tag, like Butler. Nearly half the calls resulted in
owners being reunited with their pets. Sometimes the dog made its
own way home. And sometimes the Registry matched one of its
``found'' cards with a ``lost'' card.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, all this happened within the first day of a dog being
lost. After the first day, Martin knew the odds of recovering a
lost pet dropped precipitously.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of Thursday, no one reported finding a pooch like
Butler. No one called Friday, or over the weekend, or the beginning
of the next week.
</P>
<P>
   Then that Thursday, another of the Registry's volunteers took a
call about a Boston terrier found in Johnson County. It was from a
woman named Wanda Brizendine.
`Can we keep him?'
</P>
<P>
   Brizendine had been sitting in her ranch house in the 8600 block
of Stearns Street when she heard the two preschool-aged children
next door yell,``Mom, look what we found.''
</P>
<P>
   A dog had wandered into their yard. The children asked their mom
if they could keep him. The family had just gotten rid of two
boxers. The motyher didn't want any more dogs. She told her
children ``no.'' So the children carried the dog to 68-year-old
Brizendine.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doggie needs a home, you can tell,'' Brizendine told
them. ``He's nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   She should know. She was, by her own account, ``a dog person.''
She once had three dogs in the house. She still had two, one of
which she found off the street. No one claimed it, so she kept it.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's not uncommon for people to keep the dogs they
find.
</P>
<P>
   The Lost Dog Registry had a few cases a year in which
dog-finders refused to give up what they found. Sometimes, the
owner and finder ended up in court. And Briscoe's uncle told the
story of losing his terrier once and a week later seeing someone
walking his dog.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of keeping this new dog, this Boston terrier,
crossed Brizendine's mind, too. It was so well-groomed, so
well-behaved. ``I wouldn't mind having one of these,'' she said.
And if not her, her 23-year-old grandson. He heard about what she
found and called her, wanting it.
</P>
<P>
   Brizendine debated what to do. She had the dog two nights now.
She had to at least try to find the owner. That's what she would
want with one of her pets. She remembered seeing something about
the Lost Dog Registry in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   She called.
Connection
</P>
<P>
   Registry volunteer Tessa Calegari jotted down Brizendine's
description of the Boston terrier, then thumbed through the index
cards looking for a match. There seemed to be one. She called
Briscoe and left a message for him to call Brizendine.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Briscoe got that message at home, he was in tears.
He had given up hope of ever seeing Butler again. Just that
afternoon, he had received a call from one of the animal shelters
he originally contacted. It had a dog that fit Butler's
description. After work, he raced there, but was told a woman had
just picked up the dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be kidding me!'' Briscoe roared. ``She's got my
dog!''
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to hunt her down. The shelter wouldn't tell him where
she lived. ``I was a mess,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the message to call Brizendine. He called. She
quizzed him about the dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did the tail look like?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks broken.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's him,'' Brizendine said.
</P>
<P>
   Briscoe immediately drove 16 blocks to Brizendine's. She sat in
the front yard holding the Boston terrier in her lap. Briscoe
jumped out of his car. The terrier jumped up and ran to him.
Briscoe scooped up his dog, his Butler.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's my baby, did you miss your daddy?'' he cooed.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those little-known instances of strangers helping
strangers, that sometimes fortuitous circle of circumstances when
goodness and generosity conquers grief.
</P>
<P>
   Briscoe offered to pay Brizendine. ``You've got to be kidding,''
Brizendine replied. ``This made my heart feel good.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Xircom Inc. went on a $36 million shopping spree
Monday, announcing the purchase of a line of products and an entire
company.
</P>
<P>
   Thousand Oaks-based Xircom will take a charge of $3 million to
$4 million against its earnings this quarter to cover the $13.25
million acquisition of the Rex line of electronic organizers from
Franklin Electronic Publishers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company will trade 323,905 shares of its own
stock for all outstanding shares of Entregas Technologies, a
private company from Lake Forest in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's closing stock price of $42.313 per share, the total
price tag comes to $13.7 million for the computer cable and
connector maker.
</P>
<P>
   Xircom Chief Executive Dirk Gates said the Rex product line will
expand Xircom's offerings, which already include cards to allow
local and remote network access for notebook computers and compact
cards that do the same for hand-held units.
</P>
<P>
   The Rex line is made up of credit card-sized organizers priced
from $100 to $200 that store personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Entregas' products, which include converters and connectors for
universal serial bus ports, will allow users to connect peripheral
items such as external disk drives and modems to their computers,
even if they don't have USB ports.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-quarter charge is the only hit Xircom expects to take
to its earnings because of the acquisitions, Gates said.

PRESIDENT OF MISS AMERICA ORGANIZATION IS DISMISSED 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apparently striking a blow for the traditional standards of the
Miss America Pageant, officials of the beauty and talent
competition have fired the man who tried to overturn the contest's
50-year-old ban on allowing divorced women and women who have had
an abortion to compete for the crown.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Beck, 60, who was hired last year as the president and
chief executive officer of the Miss America Organization, was
dismissed on Sunday, according to a statement by David B. Frisch,
chairman of the pageant's board of directors. Beck had two more
years on his three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Frisch's statement did not mention the controversy over the
change in pageant policy, which surfaced two weeks ago, just days
before 51 young women from across the country descended on Atlantic
City, N.J., to compete for the title.
</P>
<P>
   For 49 years, contestants had been required to sign a statement
saying they had never been married and had never been pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The policy change would have required them to say only that they
were not married and were not the natural or adoptive parent of a
child. Faced with an outcry from state pageant officials, the
national organization immediately backed off from putting the
change into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than allude to the controversy, Frisch's statement on
Monday simply said that a national search to replace Beck would
begin immediately and that his dismissal ``was in the best
interests of the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   While no one from inside the Miss America Pageant would confirm
on Monday that Beck was dismissed because of his support for the
new eligibility policy, directors of some of the state franchises
that run the local contests said there was growing disenchantment
with Beck and his changes.
</P>
<P>
   Libbi Taylor, who served as the president of the National
Association of Miss America State Pageants when the firestorm over
the new policy erupted, said she was shocked by the turn of events,
but added that representatives of all 50 states and the District of
Columbia had voted four days before the competition to condemn the
new rules.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taylor also said her group had filed a lawsuit against the
national pageant, asking a Superior Court judge in Atlantic County,
N.J., to declare the Miss America Organization immune from state
discrimination laws pertaining to divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Beck has said that the changes to the qualifications were made
to conform with state bias statutes, which prevent discrimination
on the basis of marital status, among other criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Although the contest has introduced a handful of new rules in
recent years (including one allowing competitors to wear two-piece
bathing suits as long as the bottoms are no less than one and a
half inches below the navel) none of them provoked the flurry of
ill will that the divorce and abortion policy did.
</P>
<P>
   Beck did not return several phone messages on Monday. But some
state pageant directors said he was at a disadvantage from the
start because he came to the close-knit world of the Miss America
Organization as an outsider, having worked with the U.S. Soccer
Federation Foundation and Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
</P>
<P>
   The question now, they said, is whether the state
representatives will be able to persuade the Miss America
Organization to not put the new eligibility rules into effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terrible situation for everyone involved,'' Ms.
Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the hope is _ at least my hope is _ that the board taking
this action in regards to Mr. Beck will nullify their previous
action and allow us to go back to the pre-existing rules.''

ALTHOUGH FRICTION PERSISTS, FOLLOWER OF MAHARISHI HAVE INTEGRATED
INTO SMALL IOWA TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFIELD, Iowa _ In the last 25 years, thousands have meditated
here to attain near-supernatural clarity of mind and, while they
are at it, create world peace.
</P>
<P>
   These devotees of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi think his trademarked
Transcendental Meditation techniques can actually make them float
on air.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently they have constructed homes and office buildings,
or retrofitted old ones, to face east, because the Maharishi
suggests that is the best way to capture the energy of the rising
sun.
</P>
<P>
   The locals are not buying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're Midwesterners here,'' said City Council member Neil
Doyle. ``We work with our hands. We're practical. You come in here
with some fairly crazy philosophy, and we don't swallow it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Doyle and others note, the last quarter-century has shown
that a small Midwestern town can absorb, if not really integrate, a
sizable immigration of rather unorthodox outsiders. Particularly
when the outsiders bring money and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Two members of the City Council hail from the TM movement. The
president of the local chamber of commerce is a meditator. And,
nearly as often as not, so is a Fairfield resident's boss.
</P>
<P>
   When Beth Dalbey came to town three years ago to edit /{The
Fairfield Ledger/} newspaper, her journalistic appetite for
conflict was piqued by the prospect of Eastern mysticism clashing
with Midwestern conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' she said, ``this town wasn't at all what I expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people in town who can't get along, but I don't
think it's all meditators vs. nonmeditators. It's just people who
don't play well with others.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, friction persists between old Fairfield and
meditators _ they account for about a quarter of Fairfield's 10,000
residents _ beyond the usual town-gown tension common to college
hamlets.
</P>
<P>
   Claims that group meditation lowers crime or helped end the Cold
War breed not just disbelief but also resentment.
</P>
<P>
   Nonmeditators rarely patronize the India Cafe or Every Body's
health-food store.
</P>
<P>
   And as recently as 1997, residents waited in line for up to two
hours to vote against an outspoken meditator running for a seat on
their school board. They didn't want a 'ru (as in ``guru'')
deciding what their children were taught.  &LR; brk:Euphoria and fears
 &LR; tx:Lewis Baldwin Parsons founded a Presbyterian college in
Fairfield in the late 1870s. Over its nearly century-long
existence, Parsons College gave the town an economic anchor and an
intellectual vibrancy that was the envy of other Iowa outposts.
</P>
<P>
   The school grew significantly in the 1960s , when eased
admissions standards drew thousands of academically suspect young
men looking for student deferments from the military draft.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons, however, lost its accreditation in 1967 and shut down
in bankruptcy in June 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Weeds at the school had grown waist-high when the leaders of
Maharishi International University, who had formed their school
only a year before on leased land in pricey Santa Barbara, Calif.,
purchased Parsons' 72 buildings from creditors for $2.5 million in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   Initial euphoria about the sale of the school _ locals
volunteered to mow the grounds for the new suitors _ fast gave way
to fears about what many perceived was a hippie-Asian cult moving
in.
</P>
<P>
   The Maharishi _ meaning ``great teacher'' and now pronounced
``mah-HARSH-ee'' _ brought his ideas about the mystical values of
meditation to the United States in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Its adherents insist that the movement is not a religion, rather
a mental and spiritual exercise that allows the human mind to come
closer to its full potential. In Fairfield, in fact, meditators
account for significant portions of several mainline church
congregations. Before they came to town, there were only three
Jewish families and no temple. Now there is a synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most conservative are unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a town where 40 years ago `Catholic' was a nasty
word,'' said one longtime resident. ``There are still people in
town who almost think Satan wakes up on that campus every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Those suspicions stem in part from aspects of the philosophy
that rival those of Western religions.
</P>
<P>
   The Maharishi is referred to as ``his holiness'' and is said to
be the spiritual descendant of men who, over the ages, had a unique
understanding of ancient texts.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, 20 minutes of meditation are expected twice a day.
Meditators do not consume meat or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The draw for many of the people who move to Fairfield is the
chance to meditate twice a day _ nearly two hours in the morning
and two more from 5 to 7 p.m. _ with others in one of two Golden
Domes of Pure Knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Meditation in those gender-segregated domes, built at the
Maharishi's orders, is said to lift people off the ground
momentarily. To an outsider, however, the so-called yogic flying
looks like someone hopping in the lotus position. A completely
enlightened person, such as the Maharishi, is presumed to be able
to hover indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The Maharishi, who resides in the Netherlands, has said that war
would come to an end if the square root of 1 percent of the world's
population meditated at once.
</P>
<P>
   About five years ago he weighed in on architecture. Homes and
office buildings should face east, the Maharishi stressed, while
the placement of bedrooms and kitchens held profound influence over
digestion and sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Small developments springing up in and around Fairfield feature
Maharishi Sthapatya Veda homes with tidy ornamental fences and,
because of the obsession with facing east, offer houses on only the
west side of the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're able to connect the individual intelligence of the
occupant of the house to the cosmic intelligence of the universe,''
said Jonathan Lipman, the chief architect at Maharishi Global
Construction.
</P>
<P>
   West entrances, according to a recent Maharishi pamphlet, invite
``poverty, lack of creativity and vitality.''
</P>
<P>
   The main entrances of the vaunted Golden Domes of Pure Knowledge
still face west, by the way, but are due for retrofitting. Although
the Maharishi ordered the domes built the way they are and
ostensibly was enlightened when he did, his followers explain that
he had not yet focused on architecture.  &LR; brk:Conflict of cultures
 &LR; tx:Meditators and pre-Maharishi locals agree that the running
tension in Fairfield turns on perceptions of how much influence
newcomers have over the town.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the 1997 mayoral race. Robert Rasmussen had held the
job more than 16 years. He was challenged by Ed Malloy, one of two
meditators on the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought politics should be confrontation-free, and that's
how we ran our campaign,'' Malloy said.
</P>
<P>
   By the campaign's end, however, the most prominent issue was the
specter of the Maharishi running Fairfield. One Rasmussen ad, which
/{The Fairfield Ledger/} rejected, depicted the Maharishi pulling
the strings on a mayoral puppet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a feeling in this community and this county, and
local politics everywhere, that a lot of people come in and seem to
be very transient,'' said Tom Thompson, a nonmeditator on the City
Council. ``If they're going to be bound by some kind of body, they
want it made up of people who are going to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   So the incumbent won.
</P>
<P>
   Both camps in Fairfield, however, point to the election as
something cathartic that exorcised much of the jealousies.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the divisions today, people are more likely to
talk about the success that the university has brought to town.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people who move to Fairfield to integrate the
movement more fully into their lives come because they run their
own firms and have the freedom to locate in southeast Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, several Fairfield businesses use the advancements
in computers and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   And the school, with 445 full-time and 600 part-time students,
has changed its name to Maharishi University of Management to
reflect its emphasis on business. It champions entrepreneurs and
encourages its graduates to start their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hawthorne has been practicing TM since his days as a Harvard
undergraduate. He moved around the country producing documentaries
and segments for television shows such as ``Real People'' and
``That's Incredible'' before arriving in Fairfield in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 he founded his Hawthorne Direct infomercial production
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are geographically challenged,'' Hawthorne conceded.
``There isn't a lot of credibility to having a creative advertising
agency outside New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Minneapolis or
Atlanta. It's still difficult to have our clients or prospects come
to Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the business _ its management team is made up of meditators,
but most of the 65 employees are not _ has prospered and generates
more than $50 million a year from clients that range from Abflex to
Turtle Wax to the U.S. Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every six months for the last 14 years I've thought about''
moving the business from Fairfield, Hawthorne said. ``But the level
of integrity and service our company represents, part of that is
fostered by being in a small town in the middle of Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Fairfield's old guard treasures the money and
vitality the TM movement brings to town, even while chuckling at
the offbeat beliefs that come with the package.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the employment now, people are rubbing shoulders at
their jobs quite a bit,'' said Lee Gobble, an 84-year-old retired
merchant and lifelong Fairfielder. ``People might not always want
to admit it, but the meditators are good for the town. At the
least, fewer people are afraid of them now.''
</P>
<P>
   Barriers that once separated the two worlds of Fairfield have
begun to tumble even as social mixing _ meditation time alone cuts
that to a minimum _ is rare.
</P>
<P>
   Students from the school now play on some of the same sports
teams as teens at Fairfield High School. A longstanding prohibition
on student teachers leading classes at the public schools dissolved
five years ago. This month a meditator was elected to the school
board (although voters generally did not know she is a meditator,
and she has no plans to impose the philosophy to the curriculum).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children,'' meditating Councilman Malloy said, ``are
native Iowans and native Fairfielders. This is home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have changed over time,'' said John Kelley, the
superintendent of the Fairfield Community School District.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in here with a lot of strange ideas, saying they
could solve all the world's problems, they could make themselves
invisible, control the stock market and crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they still believe that, but we don't hear that anymore.
... They do their thing, and we do our thing.''

HOLLYWOOD'S ECONOMIC REBIRTH SERVES AS EXAMPLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CHRIS SIEROTY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Hollywood renaissance continues.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales, hotel occupancy rates and just about every other
economic indicator were higher in the Hollywood Business
Improvement District in 1998 compared to '97, according to an
economic survey released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Conducted by Los Angeles-based Economics Research Associates,
the study showed hotel occupancy increased 32 percent and rates
jumped 8 percent; office lease rates increased 12 percent;
pedestrian counts increased 5 percent; and retail and restaurant
revenue increased 4 percent and 5 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's study is exciting because it validates the
enormous financial investment Hollywood property owners are making
in their district,'' said Kerry Morrison, executive director of the
Hollywood Entertainment District.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-block property-based district was formed in December 1996
and originally extended along Hollywood Boulevard from La Brea
Avenue to Mc Cadden Place. It was expanded in August 1998 to reach
all the way to Gower Street.
</P>
<P>
   The district is composed of 240 property owners who are assessed
$2.13 million annually to pay for security, maintenance services
and marketing activities to promote the revitalization of the area.
</P>
<P>
   The district also has received $1 million from the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority and $150,000 from the city, according to
Roxanna Tynan, economic development deputy for Los Angeles City
Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, whose 13th District includes
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   David Wilcox, senior vice president of Economics Research
Associates, called the Hollywood Entertainment District the most
successful BID operating in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood is currently the only BID to ensure that its program
is properly focused by `counting the house' on an annual basis, and
our analysis indicates their efforts are paying off
substantially,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Zorehkey, a retail development consultant for Frederick's
of Hollywood, said there has been a change in attitude since the
creation of the district, which has aided in cleaning up the
neighborhood and making it safer for customers, tourists and
employees.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the company is ``committed to Hollywood,'' and is
building a 15,000-square-foot retail store and office space
adjacent to the Mann's Chinese Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the district's success, ``the rest of the investment
community has gotten real interested in Hollywood,'' said Jack
Kyser, chief economist with the Los Angeles Economic Development
Corp. ``No matter where you live in Los Angeles, what goes on in
Hollywood is important to you.''
</P>
<P>
   In five years, 94 business improvement districts have been
created in the city of Los Angeles, including at least eight in the
San Fernando Valley, said Wilcox. The Sherman Oaks district went
into effect on Monday and stretches along Ventura Boulevard from
Van Nuys Boulevard to Cedros Avenue, and along Van Nuys Boulevard
from Ventura to Hortense Street.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ONCE the playoffs begin, the Astros know what needs to change.
</P>
<P>
   The Killer B's need their sting. The big bats _ those of Jeff
Bagwell, Craig Biggio and Derek Bell _ need to act that way, and
Ken Caminiti and Carl Everett must add their much-needed punch.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made about the lack of hitting in the Astros'
recent postseason escapades against the Padres and Braves. And the
criticism has come with good reason. The hitting has stunk.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how many Most Valuable Player votes Bagwell earns
after this regular season, or how high Everett's and Biggio's
batting averages climb, or how hot Caminiti's stick gets down the
stretch, they ultimately will be judged on how they hit in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   They know it. You know it. Everyone knows it.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the Astros are hoping only to get to the playoffs.
The division race is tied, the Reds are playing better baseball,
and the Astros are trying to find the magic again.
</P>
<P>
   But if you think the Astros' position atop the NL Central has
become tenuous because of a lack of hitting in big games, you need
to think again.
</P>
<P>
   As much as manager Larry Dierker and others in the organization
have lamented a lack of clutch hitting against the league's best
teams, it hasn't been the bats that have failed this club in those
big games.
</P>
<P>
   It has been, believe it or not, pitching.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros begin their most critical series of the year tonight
at the Astrodome facing a Reds team that is indeed red-hot. Lose
this series to the Reds, and the Astros frankly would not deserve a
postseason berth.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as the prevailing opinion about the Astros is that
they should be able to rely on their arms and hope the bats come
around, the reverse is true going into this critical series.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Lima and Mike Hampton are scheduled to take to the hill
tonight and Wednesday, and clearly both need to improve on their
performances against the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Notice: Against the league's best _ the Diamondbacks, Mets,
Braves and Reds _ hitting has not been the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' record against those teams stands at a disappointing
12-24. But in those 36 games, the heart of the regular batting
order _ Bagwell, Biggio, Bell, Caminiti and Everett _ has batted a
combined .300. All of them have driven in runs, gotten on base and
individually hit close to or better than their season averages.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell is at .320 in 36 games against the Mets, Diamondbacks,
Reds and Braves. Biggio is at .290, Caminiti at .380, Everett at
.310. And while Bell's average is lacking at a pedestrian .240,
it's roughly the same he has batted all season.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, and perhaps key to tonight's opener against the
Reds, is that it has been pitching _ the most consistent part of
the season-long drive to a hoped-for third Central title _ that has
lagged behind the norm against those four top NL teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' starting pitchers have given up 117 earned runs in
209 innings in those 36 games. That's a 5.02 ERA, compared to the
starters' season-long ERA of 3.84.
</P>
<P>
   And in 11 games thus far against the Reds, the starters have
given up 47 earned runs in 59 innings, a whopping 7.13 ERA. That's
just not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Lima and Hampton, the 20-game winners and Cy Young contenders,
are 0-2 with two no-decisions against the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   If something must improve beginning tonight, it's not the
sticks. They've been consistent all season against the Astros'
toughest opponents, and it would be difficult to ask for more from
Bags, Biggio, Bell, Caminiti and Everett than a combined .300
batting average over the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it's going to have to be Lima Time in more ways than one
tonight. It's going to have to be time for Lima to be at his best
against the best. And Wednesday, the reliable ``Bulldog,'' Hampton,
must have that glaring scowl and biting breaking ball that has made
him one of the league's best pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows what happened last year in the playoffs when the
bats went silent and so many hopes went down in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had this sensational season and thought we were the best
team in the league,'' Dierker said. ``It was like a kick in the gut
to lose that series to San Diego. People were walking around in a
daze.''
</P>
<P>
   But right now the Astros can't even think about what they need
to change in the playoffs. They have to get there first. And the
pressure of nearly six months of a division race comes down to two
days.
</P>
<P>
   And two arms.

RANGERS MOVE CLOSER TO YANKS IN HOME-FIELD CHASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers seized the American League West
title Sunday, but their throttle remains full-steam ahead in
pursuit of home-field advantage for the Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates played his regulars last night at The
Ballpark in Arlington, and the Rangers responded with a 3-2 victory
against the Seattle Mariners to move within one game of the New
York Yankees for the league's second-best record.
</P>
<P>
   The two clubs with the best records will earn home-field
advantage for the Division Series, and the Rangers must pass the
Yankees in the standings because New York owns the tie-breaker
after winning the season series, 8-4. That serves as the Rangers'
bull's eye for the final week of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the general feeling was, `Hey, guys, we're close
enough. Let's give it a shot,' '' said Oates, whose Rangers moved
30 games above .500 for the first time in history.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers rallied from a 2-1, sixth-inning deficit to gain a
game on the Yankees, who lost, 10-6, to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
last night. Designated hitter Lee Stevens, who produced only two
runs batted in during his previous 19 games, lifted a two-strike
pitch from closer Jose Mesa deep enough into left field for an
eighth-inning sacrifice fly that scored Juan Gonzalez with the
game-winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Rick Helling did not figure in the decision despite
a season-best 10 strikeouts during his 5 1/3-inning appearance, but
the performance represented progress for the struggling pitcher who
will start Game 2 of the Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a great deal of improvement,'' Oates said. ``He threw
more good curveballs than he had during his past two or three
outings, and he had some giddy-up on his fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling did surrender another home run _ No. 13 in his past six
starts. Yet, the 427-foot, third-inning blast by first baseman Raul
Ibanez did not spoil the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely a step in the right direction,'' Helling
said. ``There were a lot of positives from my start, but there are
still some things I need to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers manufactured the tying run in the sixth inning after
center fielder Tom Goodwin drew a leadoff walk from right-hander
Freddy Garcia. Second baseman Mark McLemore advanced Goodwin into
scoring position with a sacrifice bunt, and catcher Ivan Rodriguez
delivered the game-tying single.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez established a single-season career-high with his 193rd
base hit, and that matched Joe Torre and Ted Simmons for the second
most by a catcher in one season. Mike Piazza established the
major-league record with 201 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez also supplied perhaps the evening's most significant
defensive play by picking right fielder Jay Buhner off second base
with one out and two runners aboard in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Mike Munoz, who replaced Helling earlier in the
inning, retired pinch-hitter Mike Blowers on strikes to end the
Mariners' threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pudge gave us a big shot with the pickoff,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' bullpen again played a critical role in a victory.
Munoz provided a scoreless inning of perfect relief, and
right-hander Tim Crabtree (5-1) earned the victory by retiring all
five batters he faced. That included strikeouts of shortstop Alex
Rodriguez and center fielder Ken Griffey Jr., who swung through a
3-2 fastball up in the strike zone for the first out of the eighth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Rangers an opportunity for victory in the bottom
half of the inning, and Gonzalez's one-out double off left-hander
Steve Sinclair (0-1) set the stage.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners walked designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro
intentionally, and Stevens came through with a clutch plate
appearance after Mesa issued a five-pitch walk to third baseman
Todd Zeile to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Closer John Wetteland pitched a scoreless ninth inning to
establish the Rangers' single-season record for saves with his
43rd, which also matched his career best.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a bad way for the hangover-free Rangers to begin
their pursuit of the Yankees and Indians after Sunday's postgame
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a team full of teetotalers,'' Oates said, ``but
there was much more champagne on the floor than there was in
them.''

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Jeff Bagwell isn't surprised the Astros and Cincinnati Reds are
meeting in a high-stakes series during the final week of the
regular season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Haven't the Astros been expecting this all along?
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about this a long time ago, that it (the division)
was going to come down to this series,'' Bagwell said. ``We knew
this series would mean something.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe more than they anticipated. A two-game series against
Cincinnati beginning tonight at the Astrodome takes on increased
importance for the Astros, who now have company atop the National
League Central. The Astros dropped into a first-place tie with the
Reds following Cincinnati's 9-7 victory Monday over St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Lima (20-9) takes the mound for the Astros tonight in a
third attempt at his 21st victory, which would tie Joe Niekro's
club record. Pete Harnisch (14-10) pitches for the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going down to the wire,'' Astros shortstop Ricky
Gutierrez said. ``That's the way you want it in a pennant race, to
go in there and make your own destiny. If you win, you know you're
in the playoffs. If you don't, you might be going home.''
</P>
<P>
   Time is running out. The Reds pose a daunting task for the
Astros, having won eight of 11 meetings between the clubs this
season. They swept a four-game series June 24-27 at the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in two years, the Astros find themselves in a
neck-and-neck race for the playoffs. A sweep would give the Astros
some breathing room. A split still leaves them in decent shape for
the playoffs, as either the division champion or the NL wild-card
representative. Two losses would almost certainly make it necessary
for them to win at least two of three from the Dodgers in the
season's final weekend and hope the New York Mets continue their
late-season tumble.
</P>
<P>
   After reeling off a club-record 12 consecutive victories from
Sept. 3-14, the Astros lost a chance to clinch the division title
early by going 3-7 since Sept. 15 _ against teams that have losing
records. That includes six losses on their recent nine-game road
trip to St. Louis, Pittsburgh and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros would not offer fatigue as an excuse following their
disastrous road trip. But general manager Gerry Hunsicker would
like to see the club regain the high level of intensity it had
during its winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reds have been playing like a team trying to win a
championship,'' Hunsicker said. ``We're playing like a team trying
not to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Reds last came to town June 24-27, they were the
hottest team in baseball. And on the strength of a 10-game winning
streak _ all against division leaders Houston and Arizona _ the
Reds made their move in the division, shaving six games off the
Astros' lead in just more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   In that series vs. Cincinnati, the Astros hit .151 and were
outscored 26-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were really hot, and we were a little beat up,'' Astros
closer Billy Wagner noted. ``Now, it's a different story. We've got
some big guns at the plate and pitchers starting to pitch well. It
will be a different story for those two games. Coming down the
stretch the last week or so, there's a lot of pressure on both
teams. Each team has a lot to play for.''
</P>
<P>
   A week after being swept at home, the Astros split a four-game
set at Cinergy Field. And even though the season had yet to reach
the halfway point, the Astros were certain this week's two games
would have playoff implications.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how hard the Astros have tried to distance themselves,
the Reds have refused to go away. The Astros won six straight games
in late July. The Reds responded by winning six of seven. And
despite their 12 straight victories this month, the Astros gained
only 2{ games in that stretch as Cincinnati won 10 of 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they weren't going away,'' Astros reliever Jay Powell
said. ``(In June) they put an exclamation point that said, `We're
here to stay.' They weren't going to fade, because they have a good
squad. It's been a good race. Neither team has been able to put any
substantial ground between (itself and) the other.''
</P>
<P>
   At this stage last season, the Astros had already wrapped up the
division title and held a double-digit lead over the Chicago Cubs.
Two years ago, the Astros entered the final week of the regular
season with a 3{-game lead over the Pittsburgh Pirates. They won
their first division title in 11 years by five games.
</P>
<P>
   Since baseball went to the three-division alignment in 1994, the
NL Central has never been decided by less than five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been nerve-racking, especially after last year when we
had a comfortable margin during the second half,'' manager Larry
Dierker said. ``(1997) was different in the sense we were trying to
win it for the first time and weren't necessarily supposed to be
that good, so I don't think expectations were as great as they are
this year. If we don't win (the division) this year, we will have
blown it.''

BUSH'S BAND WAGON ROLLING INTO ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The handful of Arizona leaders gathered at the state Capitol on
Monday resembled wary homeowners bracing for a flood, stacking
testimonials for Sen. John McCain like sandbags in the path of the
advancing storm.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane hits town Tuesday in the person of Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, who arrives with a nine-point lead in a new state
poll over McCain, the endorsement of Arizona's most popular
politician, Gov. Jane Hull, and the promise of more cash at a
Phoenix fund-raiser tonight for his already bulging campaign
coffers.
</P>
<P>
   As McCain darts across the country in a whistle-stop
announcement tour, Bush will try to solidify his hold on Arizona,
whose Feb. 22 primary is a critical early campaign test for both
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think this race is going to be one of the most
interesting, exciting, and maybe bitter in the history of Arizona
politics,'' said Bruce Merrill, an ASU journalism professor and
pollster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush can drive a silver stake into McCain if he wins
Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sensing that belief, House Speaker Jeff Groscost led a
hastily called news conference at the Capitol in support of McCain
and apparently designed to blunt the impact of Hull's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost, a paid campaign consultant to McCain, was joined by 11
state lawmakers and Secretary of State Betsey Bayless, who are
supporting the senator. Several who attended the event are close
allies of Hull, including Rep. Carolyn Allen, R-Scottsdale, and
Sen. Sue Grace, R-north Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost, R-Mesa, downplayed Hull's endorsement, Bush's
fund-raising edge, and the polls, which he said were merely
measuring name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   When it was pointed out Bush leads McCain in his home state,
Groscost responded that polls don't matter right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew this was going to be an uphill battle,'' Groscost
said. ``It's not about money or polls. It's about getting our
message out.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's poll, which was conducted Thursday through Sunday,
found support among Republicans for Bush at 31 percent, McCain at
22 percent, and support for billionaire Steve Forbes at 10 percent.
The margin of error for the poll is 5.6 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill says the expected result would have McCain up 2-1 over
Bush in Arizona, especially since Bush hasn't yet visited the
state.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that the three-way race that is shaping up could get
heated as McCain tries to defend his turf. Throw in the fact that
Forbes has a penchant for negative campaign ads, and things could
get ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain cannot afford to lose Arizona. It would be an
embarrassment,'' Merrill said. ``He is obviously going to put a ton
of money and organization into this state.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Tuesday's visit is any indication, so will Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor has courted Hull's support since hosting a
$100,000 fund-raiser for her gubernatorial campaign last year. It
is unlikely he would so actively seek her endorsement only to
ignore her state's primary.
</P>
<P>
   Hull and Bush are close politically, sharing beliefs on tax
policy, social programs and border issues. They have a good working
relationship, and Hull appears to be taking an active role in the
Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will visit former U.S. House Minority Leader John Rhodes at
his Mesa home Tuesday morning before heading to downtown, where he
will lunch with Hull at her table at Tom's Tavern, in full view of
cameras and the public. Bush and Hull will then meet in her office
before attending an evening fund-raiser at the Ritz-Carlton.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will also tour the Thomas J. Pappas school for homeless
children Tuesday afternoon. &QL;

 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
LUBBOCK _ Before his weekly session with the media Monday morning,
Texas Tech coach Spike Dykes heard sports information director Kent
Partridge say there are no sideline credentials for ``shooters''
remaining for Saturday's game against Texas A&AMP;M.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Shooters,'' Dykes said. ``Now that's encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Partridge meant photographers, of course, but in the 10 days
since Texas Tech lost at home to North Texas to fall to 1-2, Dykes
has come under fire in Lubbock like never before. Dykes is in his
13th season at Tech, where he has compiled a 77-64-1 record. He has
more victories than any coach in the school's history and has taken
the Red Raiders to seven bowls.
</P>
<P>
   But in this day of sports talk-radio rage and Internet chat
rooms, all that means little. After the loss to North Texas, Don
Williams, a columnist from the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal and sports
radio talk-show host, called for Dykes to step down at the end of
the season ``for the good of the program.''
</P>
<P>
   A local TV station had a call-in poll asking whether Dykes
should resign now or wait until the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Dykes, 61, seems to have taken it all in stride. He is too busy
getting his team ready to host Texas A&AMP;M on Saturday to worry if
the oil is boiling and for whom it boils.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say a coach loses 10 percent of his friends every season
he's at a place,'' Dykes said. ``I've been here 13 years, so I
guess that puts me into the negative range.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing is that I always consider the source (of criticism).
Now, if (former Texas coach) Darrell Royal had called me up and
said, `Spike, you're doing a horrible job,' then I'd sit up and
take notice. He hasn't done that. He might, but he hasn't yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Dykes has a contract through the 2000 season, which has led to
speculation that he might be nearing the end of his career at Tech,
where he has been as an assistant or head coach since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech president Donald Haragan said he was aware of
``malcontent'' among some Red Raiders fans. Haragan cited a
university policy that prohibited him from responding ``to
individuals outside of our own system of review.'' In other words,
Dykes' status will be reviewed at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Haragan told the Avalanche-Journal: ``My head's not
in the sand. I realize people are unhappy with the program. That is
something we listen to. We will make a decision after all the
data's in for this season, sit back in a very deliberate way and
make decisions about what's best for our university.''
</P>
<P>
   What some critics seem to have lost sight of is that Dykes has
brought stability and success to the Red Raiders' program _ two
things that often are lacking at programs the size and scope of
Texas Tech's. In addition, Dykes has been able to recruit star
players like Bam Morris, Byron Hanspard, Zach Thomas and Ricky
Williams to Lubbock, which isn't an easy accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   A person who asked not be identified but who has deep roots in
Texas football said Dykes is the only thing standing between Tech
turning into another Baylor. The Bears are on their third coach
since longtime coach Grant Teaff resigned in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor has a 27-44 record and has been to one bowl in the
post-Teaff era. During the same span, Tech is 42-32 and has been to
five bowls. However, Tech is 2-7 since it started the 1998 season
with six consecutive victories, and that is what Dykes' detractors
are bringing up.
</P>
<P>
   What they might not be considering is the alternative to Dykes.
Attracting an established coach to Lubbock is out of the question.
What Tech likely would get would be an up-and-coming assistant
coach. If he were successful, he might leave to go to a more
established program. If unsuccessful, he would have to be replaced,
and the cycle would start all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Around about that time, people probably would be saying, ``Maybe
we should have kept ol' Spike around. He wasn't such a bad guy,
after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, few question whether Dykes is a good guy or not. If
Hollywood put out a casting call for a football coach from West
Texas, Dykes wouldn't get the job. He's too West Texas. You want
realism, but not this much realism.
</P>
<P>
   Dykes is comfortable in blue jeans and boots, eating barbecue
and spinning yarns about old friends and football. During the
1950s, '60s and '70s, he spent 17 years as a high school coach in
such Texas towns as Ballinger, Coahoma, Big Spring and Alice and
has stories about every stop along the line.
</P>
<P>
   During lunch Monday, he was talking about how criticism is
nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in 1964, I went to Coahoma from San Angelo, and the year
before they lost 10 games at Coahoma,'' Dykes said. ``We had some
real good players, and we won 11 games before we lost in the
bi-district round. That next week, my wife came home all teared up,
looking like she'd been hit in the face with a skillet.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she was at the post office, and two old ranchers were
talking and one of them said, `They ought to fire that coach. If
he'd played the right quarterback, they wouldn't have lost.' Some
things never change. I guess that was kind of the talk radio of
West Texas in 1964.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the late 1990s in the Big 12 Conference, the stakes are
higher than at Coahoma. Fans had high expectations for the Red
Raiders this season with Heisman Trophy candidate Ricky Williams
and an experienced quarterback in Rob Peters.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was injured as the Red Raiders lost their opener 31-13
at Arizona State and hasn't played since. Tech beat
Louisiana-Lafayette 38-17 before losing 21-14 at home to North
Texas, a 31-point underdog. Dykes doesn't sugarcoat the
disappointment in losing to the Eagles for the second time in three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost to a team that we should have beaten, and that's no
fun,'' Dykes said. ``That kind of loss makes the wolves howl. But
we've got a lot of football left. Losing that game and the other
game (at Arizona State) doesn't take away from what we set out to
do, and that's be a contender in the Big 12 South. Nothing's
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may lose one more game or no more games or eight more
games. Now we just need to try to get this train on track and go on
down the road. We need to try to digest this last loss and put all
this behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   What has changed is the way some people in Lubbock feel about
Dykes and the Tech program. Several Red Raiders said Monday they
were using all the negativity of the last 10 days to band together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised with the reaction of some of the fans,''
Williams said. ``I don't see how so many can doubt our coach. It's
two games we're talking about. We can still win the Big 12, and if
we do that I think all these people are going to be looking pretty
silly.''
</P>
<P>
   Said fullback Sammy Morris: ``We're using all of this as a
motivational thing. This is the worst (criticism) since I've been
here (1995), and it's not fair. There seems to be a lot of negative
people out there, and I don't understand it. But we're going to
stick together, and something like this where everybody's on our
case and coach's case, this just might bring us together even
closer as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Dykes' teams have had a history of playing well against A&AMP;M,
winning three of the last four games and losing 17-10 last season
at College Station. The last five games have been decided by seven
points or fewer, so it would not be surprising if the Red Raiders
bounced back with a strong effort Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Should they pull off an upset, the talk shows no doubt would be
full of callers wanting to give Dykes a contract extension. Dykes
understands that the ebb and flow of fan and media opinion goes
with the territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I should worry more about this sort of thing, but
right now I'm more worried about getting ready to play the
Aggies,'' Dykes said. ``Like it or not, the distraction is there,
but we're not going to worry about every outside deal. We can't. If
we do that, we won't have enough time to do what we're here for.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BROOKLINE, Mass. _ One picture is worth a thousand words, and there
is the image that we all will remember from a star-spangled
afternoon when the Ryder Cup returned to the Colonies.
</P>
<P>
   It is one that shows the jubilant American team crowded onto a
tiny porch on the second floor of the men's grill, turning a piece
of the staid old Country Club into the most happening place since
the lights went out on the dance floor at Studio 54.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods wearing a grin that was worth more than the millions
from a dozen Nike commercials. David Duval hanging over the balcony
spraying the crowd down below with the foam from all those
champagne bottles. Phil Mickelson pumping his triumphant fist and
throwing his cap into the throng. Even veteran Tom Lehman going
Brandi Chastain one better by peeling off his shirt and heaving it
out as a souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   This was the moment that American golf fans will remember
generations from now and one that we only hope sticks in the
memories of the U.S. golfers who make the trip across the pond to
defend the Cup at The Belfry in two years.
</P>
<P>
   This was what America had wanted to see all along from this
talented bunch, a sense of unity, a sense of passion, a sense of
team.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, it was transformed into an extraordinary day when the
red, white and blue boys staged the most incredible comeback in
Ryder Cup history and then had it all topped off by Justin
Leonard's 45-foot putt that set off a re-creation of the Boston Tea
Party with all of the whooping and hollering.
</P>
<P>
   What we must hope is that the entire experience _ the lows, the
highs, the dramatic conclusion, the hugging, the bonding, the
partying _ will now transform the young guns who will carry the
banner for the U.S. into the next millennium into more than just a
wealthy collection of mini-corporations who want to grouse and
complain about the profits from such an event rather than just
diving into it headfirst.
</P>
<P>
   We should hope that Tiger realizes there can be more to golf
than 300-yard drives and bouncing the ball off his wedge for the
cameras. We should hope that the cardboard cutout Duval now sees
that there really is something to summoning up the patriotic fervor
displayed by the Europeans for this three-day ``exhibition.'' We
should hope that Mickelson has learned that it is more fun to wrap
himself in the flag rather than bank deposit slips.
</P>
<P>
   It was a weekend when Spanish teen-ager Sergio Garcia hopped up
and down the fairways and proclaimed with a giggle: ``I love to
play for my continent.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Americans can take a cue from El Nino and come out to
try to win the next one for Canada, too.
</P>
<P>
   It only became an event to truly remember after the haughty and
heavily favored _ by themselves _ U.S. team led up to the Ryder Cup
by grumbling about the money controversy, then dug itself a 10-6
hole in the team competition before finally closing ranks and
engaging in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. players, it became a day for Old Glory and
a Fourth of July fireworks display in September only after they
listened to Alamo-inspired speeches and heard Duval stand up
Saturday night and say, ``Let's kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval mugged for the cameras and the crowd after closing out his
walloping of Jesper Parnevik, sprayed champagne on everybody in New
England, then came to the interview room and told the media that
``nobody can know how it feels except the players on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just the point, David. Everyone except the team did know
how it was supposed to feel, and that's why everything before the
Sunday rally was so disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Team captain Ben Crenshaw pleaded and cajoled them to be a team,
to keep the faith. The players, it seems, were the last ones to
understand what it was all about and climb aboard the emotional
bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the credit belongs to the media that criticized the U.S.
efforts on the first two days and evidently lit the Americans'
fires. Some of the credit belongs to NBC analyst Johnny Miller for
his frankness. There was: ``Justin Leonard should go home and watch
on TV,'' and ``Tiger Woods, are you kidding me? Do something.''
Some of the credit belongs to the fans who lined the fairways and
greens and often embarrassed the U.S. players by begging them to at
least act like they cared.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when they'd had enough abuse, they did, and the result
was another American Revolution. Hearts began to beat with either
pride or indignity, blood began to boil and, at the end of the day,
they stood there on the balcony, drenched in champagne, soaked in
pride.
</P>
<P>
   And bathed, we can only hope, in long overdue understanding of
what it's all about.

SPRINT-MCI WORLDCOM UNION FEASIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A merger of Sprint Corp. and MCI WorldCom would face scrutiny
from U.S. and European regulators. But most experts think
authorities would approve such a deal, albeit with conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint and MCI WorldCom refuse to comment on reports that they
are discussing a merger, which would create a giant in almost every
area of telecommunications, from local and long-distance voice to
Internet and wireless services.
</P>
<P>
   The combination would be examined by at least three regulatory
bodies _ the Justice Department, the Federal Communications
Commission and the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these mergers can go through,'' said David Wilson of
New Frontiers Communications Consulting in Washington. ``The
question is what kinds of conditions regulators slap on them and
whether the companies think it's worth the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and European Commission primarily are
concerned with whether the merged companies would overwhelmingly
dominate a business and be able to smother competition.
</P>
<P>
   On that level, a Sprint-MCI WorldCom deal would face two
pressure points: voice and Internet.
</P>
<P>
   MCI and Sprint collectively control more than 30 percent of the
long-distance industry. That doesn't match AT&AMP;T's nearly 50 percent
share, but it's certainly enough to give regulators pause on
antitrust grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would definitely be a very steep increase in market
concentration,'' said Alan Roth, a lawyer and government relations
consultant. ``Each one becomes progressively more difficult to
explain and support. Where do we go after that _ AT&AMP;T and MCI
merging?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the market dominance of the three largest long-distance
carriers is being challenged by the emergence of new players such
as Qwest Communications, which controls a potentially higher
capacity long-distance network than either Sprint or MCI WorldCom,
even without the embedded customer base.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant long-distance carriers also face challenges from
technology such as the Internet, which has some computer users
making free long-distance calls. Once allowed into the
long-distance business, regional Bell operating companies such as
Southwestern Bell also will be potent competitive forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The usual suspects that don't like consolidation would come
out of the woodwork,'' said Wilson, referring to consumer advocates
that have opposed most telecommunications mergers. ``But voice
concentration is a difficult argument to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts think MCI WorldCom would even be willing to sell
off Sprint's long-distance network if that's what it took to get
its hand on its real target: Sprint's wireless business, Sprint
PCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major concern here with regulators is going to be
concentration in Internet backbone and connectivity,'' said Marvin
Kahn, a consultant with Exeter Associates of Silver Spring, Md.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom and Sprint are the two largest providers of
connections to the Internet, together providing more than 43
percent of Internet service providers with their connection to the
Internet, according to a recent survey by /{Boardwatch/} magazine.
</P>
<P>
   When WorldCom bought MCI last year, regulators forced the
company to sell off MCI's Internet backbone assets. A Sprint-MCI
WorldCom combination would probably face the same conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission, traditionally charged
with assuring that the merger parties could meet financial and
licensing requirements, could also weigh in on whether a merger was
in the ``public interest.'' That's a nebulous standard, but one
that the current commission has interpreted broadly as a proactive
mandate to increase competition in phone markets.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing a preliminary approval of the proposed merger of SBC
Communications, parent of Southwestern Bell, with Ameritech, the
FCC imposed a broad set of conditions that would force the parties
to move into new markets, establish separate subsidiaries for some
services and spend money to upgrade service in low-income areas.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether the FCC would exercise the same kind of
control with a merger of MCI WorldCom and Sprint. To date, it has
been far more concerned with opening competition in local telephone
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of issues that could slow a transaction
between Sprint and MCI, but nothing that MCI would fight,'' Kahn
said. ``MCI would come up with a package that would appease
regulators.''

 .. NOTE LONG BEACH CONNECTION (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANCASTER, Calif. _ Greg Harris shares a baseball legacy with
Elton ``Ice Box'' Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain and Harris are the only two ambidextrous pitchers to
throw both right- and left-handed in the same game in major-league
history.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlin had accomplished the milestone 107 years earlier.
When he read about Chamberlain, Harris felt as though he were
looking into a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called him `Ice Box' because he had ice in his veins. I
prided myself on being that kind of player,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago today, Harris became the Chamberlin of his
century. In what amounted to the final appearance of his career,
the Montreal Expos reliever pitched one inning throwing both right-
and left-handed to two Cincinnati Reds hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Harris had tried for years to pull off the feat without success.
But late in the 1995 season, Expos general manager Kevin Malone,
manager Felipe Alou and pitching coach Joe Kerrigan were willing to
let Harris become the second ambidextrous pitcher in history if the
situation were right.
</P>
<P>
   The final weekend of the season, in a game the Expos were losing
to the Reds, the opportunity presented itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amazing thing is I waited nine years for it to happen,''
said Harris, who spent 1999 as the Lancaster JetHawks' pitching
coach. ``(Two things) about being up there with that group.... One,
they thought it was good for the game. And two, they wanted to see
it. Their attitude to what it was all about was the attitude I was
looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh inning against the Reds in a blowout situation,
Kerrigan made a phone call to the Montreal bullpen and told Harris
to begin throwing.
</P>
<P>
   With both hands.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was a natural right-hander but had a strong left arm and
left leg from playing sports as a youngster growing up in the Long
Beach area.
</P>
<P>
   Having pitched with a custom-made, six-finger glove (suitable
for either hand) since 1986, Harris began his warmup tosses as a
both a righty and a southpaw, tipping off anyone who could see the
bullpen area as to what might be coming.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan made a trip to the pen and told Harris if he could
retire the first batter of the ninth inning right-handed, he could
make the switch to the next left-hander in Cincinnati's lineup.
</P>
<P>
   What transpired was a baseball rarity. Reggie Sanders led off
the inning, yelling out a question to Harris to see if the pitches
were going to be left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all saw me warm up.... so I told Reggie `You going to bat
left-handed?''' Harris said. ``The first pitch I throw ... he
grounds out to short. So I'm thinking `Oh my gosh, here we go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Left-swinging Hal Morris was next and Harris switched his glove
over to the right hand.
</P>
<P>
   The first southpaw pitch of his career was a blazing fastball
that sailed past the right side of the batter's box and all the way
to the backstop. Every pitch Harris threw to Morris came closer to
the strike zone, but it was a less-than-convincing four-pitch walk.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Harris, an earlier ejection of Reds catcher
Benito Santiago brought his left-handed batting replacement Eddie
Taubensee to the plate and a shot at redemption for Harris from the
left side.
</P>
<P>
   He restored some of his bruised pride by throwing a strike to
Taubensee. The count eventually went full, but Harris won the
battle on a `nubber' in front of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Bret Boone hit next, turning Harris back to his
natural throwing side. Boone got a big cut on a Harris fastball but
just missed it, fouling it straight back and shattering a piece of
plexiglass that added to the lore.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the tape (Expos broadcaster Ken) Singleton's going, `Well
we know which side he throws harder from.' That was a classic
line,'' said Harris, who induced a come-backer from Boone to
complete the scoreless inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw to two righties and two lefties in the same inning. No
runs, no hits, (but) for me that was something.... The way I went
about it and the way it was treated, it was done on a professional
level and that's all I was looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   In Montreal, media attention was scarce. But Harris, who
compiled an ordinary 74-90 record during his 15-year career, caught
Cooperstown's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next morning I get out to the ballpark and the Hall of
Fame calls.... This is the next morning. I was shocked,'' Harris
said. ``What they wanted was the ball. I figured I may as well give
them a glove.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris delivered one of his novelty mitts and the baseball to
the Hall personally. The memorabilia was placed on the second floor
``Evolution of Equipment'' exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Harris left the mound that night with plans to continue his
ambidextrous habits the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started playing catch three days a week left-handed so I
could get stronger and stronger, so what I was anticipating next
year (was) going to spring training with Montreal and being able to
do it more on a regular basis,'' Harris said. ``Why should I come
in and face a righty and then get taken out to face a
left-hander?''
</P>
<P>
   But Harris didn't anticipate the Expos releasing him the
following spring. Nobody else had any interest in the
then-39-year-old who'd been the oldest pitcher in the National
League.
</P>
<P>
   But from the left side or the right one, Harris's place among
baseball's folk heroes is secure. &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;  &QL;

RANGERS MANAGER'S QUIET TOUCH MAKES HIM MIDAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ One of Johnny Oates' most admirable traits as
a manager is too often overlooked and underappreciated: He knows
when to shut his pie hole.
</P>
<P>
   This is a dying art, particularly among managers and coaches in
virtually every sport.
</P>
<P>
   There's a budding Knute Rockne, aching to deliver his own
slobbery ``Win one for the Gipper'' speech, in every locker room
these days.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to inspire their teams, coaches have been known to eat
worms, castrate calves and drop-kick food-laden tables, scattering
spaghetti and meatballs to all corners of the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   If Oates was tempted to demonstrate any of these tried-and-true
sports-management techniques before Oakland arrived for the most
crucial series of the season over the weekend, he somehow resisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't anything said,'' second baseman Mark McLemore
insisted last night as the Rangers opened their final home series
of the season against the Mariners while savoring their third
division title in four years. ``No big meeting. No big speech. No
rallying the troops. We just went out and did what we had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Rangers did was respond to Oates' silence with a
crushing three-game sweep that allowed them to clinch the American
League West flag at home and spend the final week of the season
trying to catch Cleveland and New York for home-field advantage in
the first-round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Oates' unusual silent treatment is an oversight that could get
him thrown out of the Inspirational Speakers Bureau because, you
see, it is his second glaring offense within a 12-month period.
</P>
<P>
   He also somehow kept his trap shut last September, when the
Rangers, tied for the division lead with the Angels, traveled to
Anaheim for their most critical series of the '98 season. They
outscored the Angels, 27-3 in those three games.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody see a pattern developing here?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could have blamed Oates if he had called a dramatic team
meeting and put on an act worthy of Sir Laurence Olivier before
Friday's series opener with the A's. His team had, after all, lost
seven of its past 11 games, including four out of five, to the
flotsam and jetsam of the American League.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City, for crying out loud, beat the Rangers three out of
four. Tampa Bay and Baltimore paddled their behinds.
</P>
<P>
   There are managers out there who would have felt compelled to do
``something''.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to do the opposite,'' Oates said before the Rangers' 3-2
victory over Seattle. ``So I do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having meetings in those situations just sends out warnings.
There's a time and place for everything. If you feel your problems
stem from lack of effort or lack of intensity, nonchalant play,
mentally not concentrating, yeah, that needs to be corrected. But I
didn't see any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The true test of a manager is whether or not he knows his
players. Oates does. He knew if he didn't get excited, they
wouldn't either.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you stay calm, let them know you've got confidence in them
and everything will work out,'' he said. ``The worst thing you can
do is get all panicky and scare them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young kids, you have to take them by the hand and lead them.
But when you've got a veteran ballclub like this, you just let them
go play. As long as the mental approach is there, the effort's
there, it doesn't need to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Said third-base coach Jerry Narron: ``One of the best things
Johnny does is play it even keel. He has a lot of patience. He
knows when to sit tight.''
</P>
<P>
   And when to keep his lip zipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest fault has been trying too hard, trying to hit the
ball too hard, too far, take too many bases, make a throw we
shouldn't make,'' Oates said. ``When we just let the game come to
us, we're fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Mac's hit \Rin the fourth inning of the first game
against the A's\S, we relaxed and let the game come to us. We did
that all weekend. It looked like we had fun. We just relaxed and
played the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland series and last year's showdown with the Angels were
eerily similar. Last September, the Rangers had won a huge game at
Baltimore when Will Clark beat out an infield hit and Pudge
Rodriguez hit a game-winning home run, and came home for a two-game
series with the Angels, trailing by two games. They won twice to
tie the race and then headed for Anaheim for the final three-game
shootout there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most fun I've ever had in baseball,'' McLemore said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers blew the Angels away, just as they did the A's over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three games in both series were no-contest,'' Oates said.
``Everything we tried worked, everything they tried didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the other guys just weren't quiet enough.
</P>
<P>
   Silence, it seems, really is golden. \Ntagtop:Jim Reeves, (817)

CANDIDATE WADES INTO IS SUES, RIVALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A buoyant John McCain, confident he has established himself as a
credible presidential contender, formally opened his 2000 campaign
by aggressively engaging GOP front-runner George W. Bush on the
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republican senator, who Monday began a four-day
``kickoff'' tour for a campaign he actually began in December, will
seek during the tour not only to define himself more vividly, but
to do so at the expense of Bush and presidential rival Patrick
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The national tour began with a speech in this mill town and ends
Thursday with an ``Arizona welcome party'' and rally in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   A centerpiece of the address was McCain's proposal to reform the
big-money political system, and a call to sacrifice and service. He
said special-interest money in politics is squeezing Americans out
of the political process and causing deep cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our new patriotic challenge,'' McCain said. ``It is a
challenge to each of us to join in the fight against the pervasive
cynicism that is debilitating our democracy, that cheapens our
public debates, that threatens our public institutions, our culture
and, ultimately, our private happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Red, white and blue confetti shot into the sky when he finished
the speech. Speakers blared rock music, including the classic
``Johnny B. Goode,'' with its refrain of ``Go, Johnny, go!''
Cheerleaders from the University of New Hampshire clapped along and
danced.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, joined by wife Cindy, stood on a stage at a community
park surrounded by tennis courts and a green field. The area was
papered with ``McCain 2000'' posters featuring a black-and-white
photo of McCain as a young naval aviator leaning against his plane.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was cheerful and relaxed as he began the long campaign
swing. As his chartered plane prepared for takeoff to New
Hampshire, he grabbed the cabin microphone and told reporters and
staff, ``We haven't raised as much money as we had hoped, so I'm
going to have to pilot the plane today.''
</P>
<P>
   New on Monday was McCain's more aggressive definition of his
policy positions and his personality at the expense of Bush and
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Senior McCain campaign officials acknowledged the shift, saying
the Arizonan had established himself as a credible challenger and
was ready to take the next logical step. They said it was easier to
contrast campaign ideas now that Bush has provided details on his
plans for education, defense and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's new assertiveness was evident in the 25-minute speech
he gave here to a lunch-time crowd of about 500 people.
</P>
<P>
   Without ever mentioning the Texas governor by name, McCain
suggested that he, and not Bush, is better equipped for the
``solemn responsibility'' of commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to making the decision to send our young men and
women into harm's way, that decision should be made by a leader who
knows that such decisions have profound consequences,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a time when our nation's leader can no longer rely
on briefing books and talking points, when the experts and the
advisers have all weighed in, when the sum total of one's life
becomes the foundation from which he or she makes the decisions
that determine the future of our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   A son and grandson of Navy admirals, McCain, 63, is a former
Vietnam prisoner of war. Bush served in the Texas Air National
Guard during the war and has had to answer reporters' questions
about whether he received preferential treatment to remain
stateside because of the influence of his father.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has pledged to abide by the so-called ``11th
Commandment,'' once heralded by former President Reagan, which
prohibits personal attacks on fellow Republicans during
presidential campaigns. McCain has said the GOP hurt itself in the
1996 presidential election by its candidates' repeated attacks on
eventual nominee Bob Dole during the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   McCain invoked the pledge in Monday's speech, promising to
``campaign with respect for the dignity of the office I seek and
the people I seek to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain, who calls Bush ``a fine man,'' believes he can
take the high road while emphasizing the candidates' principal
areas of disagreement, including campaign-finance reform and
education.
</P>
<P>
   On education, McCain aides say he wants to move more swiftly
than Bush to test a national voucher program that the senator said
Monday would ``give middle- and lower-income parents the same right
wealthier parents have _ to send their child to the school that
best meets their needs.''
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of campaign finance, Bush does not want to go as
far as McCain, who wants to ban all ``soft money'' contributions by
corporations, wealthy individuals and others to national political
parties. The money is supposed to be used for party-building
efforts, but Democrats and the GOP stretched the rules in 1996 and
used it on behalf of the presidential candidates as well.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's announcement tour, originally scheduled for last April,
was postponed until this week due to the air war in Kosovo. To the
amusement of pundits, he still refers to it as a kickoff, even
though he has been stumping in his targeted primary states _ New
Hampshire, South Carolina, California and Arizona _ for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this the final kickoff, or the mid-kickoff, or the
pre-kickoff?'' New Hampshire pollster Dick Bennett joked in an
interview last week when told of McCain's plans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was formally launching his campaign just as former Vice
President Dan Quayle was bowing out. The McCain campaign announced
Monday it has picked up the endorsement of Dana Edwards, Quayle's
former chairman in Keene, N.H. McCain aides said Quayle's departure
could also help fund-raising, especially in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   From here, McCain headed to New York City for a fund-raiser
Monday night, then prepared for a South Carolina education speech
Tuesday. Another key stop will be Wednesday at the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   There, McCain is expected to further contrast his worldview with
that of Buchanan in a speech on foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was the first of the GOP presidential candidates to
sharply attack Buchanan for his book, ``A Republic, Not an
Empire,'' and subsequent comments that Hitler didn't pose a direct
threat to the United States after 1940. While Bush has said
Buchanan should remain in the GOP, McCain suggested Buchanan had,
in effect, abandoned the party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has criticized Buchanan's isolationist outlook on
trade and other matters, said in his speech Monday that
``isolationism and protectionism are a fool's errand.'' Buchanan
has said the United States is too prone to intervene in foreign
matters in which it has no legitimate stake.
</P>
<P>
   McCain treated Monday's ``kickoff'' speech is a major event, and
so did the news media. He was accompanied on the campaign plane by
reporters from the ``New York Times,'' ``Washington Post,'' ``Wall
Street Journal,'' ``Los'' ``Angeles Times'' and the major weekly
newsmagazines.
</P>
<P>
   All of McCain's seven children were expected to be on hand for
various portions of the trip; six of them were with him in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Before traveling to Nashua, McCain began the day with a private
address _ aides described it as informal _ to about 4,000
midshipmen and officials at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. One
of McCain's former academy classmates, Adm. Charles Larson, joined
the senator for the trip to New Hampshire. &QL;

<P>
   DALLAS _ The first hint that the Mavericks are serious about
turning their fortunes around was delivered yesterday when
assistant coach Donnie Nelson announced that all five starting
positions are up for grabs heading into the opening of training
camp Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, no one will automatically start just because the
Mavericks have invested a lot of money in them. And no one will
start just because they started during last year's 19-31 season, or
just because owner Ross Perot Jr. flew to another continent to meet
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is wide-open,'' Nelson said. ``We can't afford for
it not to be wide-open.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Unlike last season, when some players privately
griped that point guard Steve Nash and small forward Dirk Nowitzki
did not win their starting spots on the court, they will have to
earn spots this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not opposed to starting anyone,'' Nelson said. ``We're
going to play guys and start guys that give us the best chance to
win, regardless of what name is on the back of that jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he wants to send a message that hard work and
individual success will translate into more playing time, and that
no one will be offered an easy ride.
</P>
<P>
   But does Nelson's stance really include Michael Finley and Gary
Trent? Apparently, it does, although they probably are expected to
win their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how hard Mike has worked in Chicago, and I know his
frame of mind coming in here,'' Nelson said. ``It would be shocking
to me if Mike didn't get out of the gate big-time and really start
the season out with a major-league bang.'' No Hill deal The
Mavericks are refuting a report that the team offered Robert Pack,
John ``Hot Rod'' Williams and Ansu Sesay to the Philadelphia 76ers
for power forward Tyrone Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Philadelphia Inquirer'' reported that the Mavericks made
the offer at the NBA league meetings in Vancouver, British Columbia
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't comment on trades or speculations thereof, per team
policy,'' Mavericks assistant coach Donnie Nelson said. ``But
that's not accurate. What you read is not accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixers general manager Bill King told the ``Inquirer'' that the
Mavericks had inquired about Hill. Jones to China Former TCU guard
Mike Jones said he plans to play basketball in China this season,
although the Mavericks are holding out hope he'll be in their
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he is scheduled to leave for Shanghai on Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully next year I can come back to the Mavericks camp and
work out again and then see what happens from there,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a 6-foot-3 guard, played last season in Poland and was a
bright spot in the Mavericks' minicamp and summer league, but he is
considered too short to play shooting guard and not skillful enough
to play point guard. Forget Rodman That nonsense about free-agent
forward Dennis Rodman possibly becoming a member of the Mavericks
is just that: nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis, in my opinion, is the wrong influence to have around a
young team,'' Donnie Nelson said. ``I don't like the message that
we send to our players, and more importantly, to our fans, by
having Dennis Rodman being a Dallas Maverick.'' nn

KC LIFE INSURANCE VICE CHAIRMAN DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter E. Bixby Jr., vice chairman of Kansas City Life Insurance
Co., died early Monday at Research Medical Center after a
three-month battle with lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Bixby, 67, had been the insurance company's vice chairman since
April 1998. Bixby was president of Kansas City Life from 1990 to
1998 and was just the sixth president in the company's history,
which spans more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Bixby followed in the footsteps of his older
brother, J.R. Bixby, and their father, Walter E. Bixby Sr.
</P>
<P>
   He started his career at Kansas City Life in 1945, while in high
school. He earned a degree in business administration at the
University of Missouri-Columbia and served two years in the Air
Force.
</P>
<P>
   Bixby started working full time at the company in 1955. In 1966
he was elected to the board of Kansas City Life and was named a
vice chairman in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   He was involved in several area organizations, including the
Kansas City Art Institute; KCPT, Channel 19; and the J.B. Reynolds
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Bixby served 22 years on the board of the Kansas City Art
Institute and was known for having an interest in visual arts and
in helping young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was deeply involved and caring about the success of our
students,'' said Kathleen Collins, president of the institute. ``He
was very supportive in terms of financial support that helped us
maintain the excellence we've been known for.''
</P>
<P>
   Bixby is survived by his sons, R. Philip Bixby and Walter E.
Bixby III; his daughter, Ann O'Connor; his brother, Joseph R.
Bixby; and seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service is scheduled for 3 p.m. Wednesday at St.
Andrew's Episcopal Church. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that
contributions be made to the Kansas City Art Institute.

the season out with a major-league bang.'' No Hill deal The
Mavericks are refuting a report that the team offered Robert Pack,
John ``Hot Rod'' Williams and Ansu Sesay to the Philadelphia 76ers
for power forward Tyrone Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Philadelphia Inquirer'' reported that the Mavericks made
the offer at the NBA league meetings in Vancouver, British Columbia
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't comment on trades or speculations thereof, per team
policy,'' Mavericks assistant coach Donnie Nelson said. ``But
that's not accurate. What you read is not accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixers general manager Bill King told the ``Inquirer'' that the
Mavericks had inquired about Hill. Jones to China Former TCU guard
Mike Jones said he plans to play basketball in China this season,
although the Mavericks are holding out hope he'll be in their
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he is scheduled to leave for Shanghai on Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully next year I can come back to the Mavericks camp and
work out again and then see what happens from there,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a 6-foot-3 guard, played last season in Poland and was a
bright spot in the Mavericks' minicamp and summer league, but he is
considered too short to play shooting guard and not skillful enough
to play point guard. Forget Rodman That nonsense about free-agent
forward Dennis Rodman possibly becoming a member of the Mavericks
is just that: nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis, in my opinion, is the wrong influence to have around a
young team,'' Donnie Nelson said. ``I don't like the message that
we send to our players, and more importantly, to our fans, by
having Dennis Rodman being a Dallas Maverick.'' nn

TRACK MOURNS DRIVER

<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ Irwindale Speedway flags flew at half-staff
Monday, two days after the death of driver Keith Cowherd of Phoenix
in a Mechanix Wear Speed Truck Challenge race.
</P>
<P>
   Cowherd, to the dismay of Irwindale Speedway officials, was the
second driver to be killed at the $10 million, state-of-the-art
facility in its first six months of operation.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Wilkings, Irwindale's outgoing chief operating officer,
noted that there were only five race-related fatalities in the 30
years that he was the track manager at Saugus Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty rare,'' Wilkings said. ``It's unfortunate that it
happened and unfortunate that it has happened twice. We may go 10
years before it might happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey Diemert of Rosebud, Ore., died while practicing in his
sprint car before Irwindale's March 27 opening-night program.
</P>
<P>
   When Kevin Gobrecht died during practice for a World of Outlaws
race at I-80 Speedway in Greenwood, Neb., on Friday, it was only
the second fatality in 20 years for that series.
</P>
<P>
   When Gonzalo Rodriguez died during qualifying for the CART race
at Laguna Seca two weeks ago, it was the first death at the
Monterey road course in 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Marin in Bakersfield has not had a track-related fatality
in more than a decade, track officials said. There have been no
fatalities at California Speedway or at Perris Auto Speedway. A fan
at the Orange Show in San Bernardino died in the early 1980s when
hit by a race car.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of the stark reality that this can be a dangerous
sport,'' Irwindale chief executive officer Jim Williams said. ``You
look at CART and until (La Canada native Jeff) Krosnoff died (two
years ago), it was go-go-go with nothing going wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowherd, 49, and Shawn Davidson of Mammoth Lakes got tangled up
entering Turn 1 Saturday night. Davidson hit the atteunator, a
specially designed padding on the wall at the pit area entrance,
nearly head-on. Both spun sideways and Cowherd apparently slammed
sideways into Davidson, who went from about 91 mph to a dead stop
in a matter of milliseconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our understanding is that he suffered blunt-force trauma to
his brain stem,'' Speed Truck series co-director Jay Rutherford
said of Cowherd. The L.A. County Coroner's Office has yet to
perform an autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Cowherd was transported to Santa Teresita Hospital in Duarte by
ambulance, where he was pronounced dead at 11:25 p.m.,
approximately an hour after the accident. Davidson was airlifted to
Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena because of possible head
injuries, Wilkings said. Davidson was released from the hospital
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Cowherd's wife, Margie, nor his three children, ages 27,
25 and 11, were in attendance Saturday night. Funeral services are
pending.
</P>
<P>
   A moment of silence will be offered for Cowherd before this
Saturday's race. A page dedicated the likable driver will be placed
in the program and a track official will attend his funeral,
Irwindale public relations director Doug Stokes said.
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford said the family may donate money to fund a children's
play area at the track to honor Cowherd, who has raced in the
series for a year after giving up drag racing.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first fatality for the San Bernardino-based Speed
Truck series, which consists of identical Chevrolet S-10 trucks.
Drivers cannot tamper with the engines.
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford said safety features in both trucks involved in the
accident were checked before the race and were untampered. He said
the cockpit in Cowherd's truck was undamaged, even with a wheel
pushed up to the firewall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The integrity of the chassis and the cockpit were 100 percent
intact,'' he said. ``The trucks were destroyed, but the driver's
compartment was not.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Williams and Wilkingssaid the track has taken more
precautions than any other short track to insure safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built this is as safe as we could possibly build it,'' said
Wilkings, who leaves the speedway Friday for Rebco Co. in Cummins,
Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The atteunator was designed by Bill Simpson. The foam substance
is the same as that used at the pit entrance to Indianapolis Motor
Speedway. The point where the atteunator is located is wider than
the main outside wall and it curves away from the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did exactly what it was supposed to do,'' Wilkings said.
</P>
<P>
   Speed Truck co-director Mike Face said his company will view
videotape of the accident today. Both cars are still in the
technical inspection area at the speedway. Defending Speed Truck
series champion Art Nevill says Irwindale Speedway is safe -- even
safer than other tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run at Phoenix, were we can get up to 150 mph,'' he said.
``One bad move and something can happen. Something happening like
this is weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevill, from Acton, was not in the race Saturday. He had
severely sprained his ankle and raced to the Southern California
Legends title earlier in the evening, but the ankle prevented him
from properly preparing his truck for racing. He said he was
leaving the facility at the time of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably a sudden stop,'' he said of what killed
Cowherd. ``I think the track is safe. There's only so much you can
do. I've raced on tracks that are not as safe. At Cajon, you have
to make an abrupt turn to get into the pits.''
</P>
<P>
   Orange Show promoter Dan White said he quickly became friends
with Coherd.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a really, really nice guy,'' White said. ``He always
had top-looking equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint-car driver Diemert died when he failed to slow down in
Turn 3 when the track went to a caution or yellow flag.
</P>
<P>
   Diemert died of massive head trauma. The cage of his car hit the
outside wall after catapulting off a stalled car.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first accident was pilot error,'' Wilkings said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seeking to end a dispute with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
over a controversial art exhibition, the chairman of the Brooklyn
Museum of Art on Monday discussed with city officials the
possibility of removing the painting that had become the flashpoint
of the controversy _ a dung-stained portrait of the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   But after the officials disclosed the discussions to reporters,
other museum officials responded with dismay and the museum
chairman said on Monday night the exhibition would proceed as
planned.
</P>
<P>
   The development appeared to only deepen a battle that the mayor
has embraced with gusto and that on Monday spilled into his likely
Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was forced to
speak out on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever I discussed is now off the table,'' Robert S. Rubin,
chairman of the museum's board of trustees, said on Monday night,
clearly upset that word of his negotiations had been made public
before he had discussed them with other top museum officials.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Lehman, director of the museum, said on Monday night that
he remained opposed to removing the Virgin Mary painting, or any
other works, from the exhibit. But he added that he was willing to
consider two other proposals Rubin had discussed with the city.
</P>
<P>
   According to City Hall officials, Rubin had tentatively offered
_ subject to approval from the museum board _ a package of
concessions aimed at overcoming Giuliani's objections to the
exhibition, and at ensuring continued public funding to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   The package, city officials said, included removing the Virgin
Mary painting by the artist Chris Ofili, segregating five or six
other controversial works from the rest of the exhibition, and
accepting a 20 percent reduction in the city's subsidy to the
museum during the length of the show, which is scheduled to start
on Saturday and run through Jan. 9. The 20 percent reduction
corresponds to the amount of floor space the museum is devoting to
the exhibition, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this offer is true, it represents a major concession on the
part of the Brooklyn Museum, and a significant victory for Rudy
Giuliani,'' said Joseph J. Lhota, deputy mayor for operations, who
did not attend the meeting. ``On the money issue, in fact, if
that's true, it's important that taxpayer dollars will not be spent
on a painting which desecrates religion, plus other pieces of art
which glorify a child-murderer and the other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin acknowledged discussing the three ideas with city
officials, but he vigorously disputed their characterization of the
talks, and he emphasized that he engaged in the negotiations on his
own initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am chairman of the museum, and I _ without authorization
from the board, or without discussion with the staff of the museum
_ did raise certain ideas, that if they were acceptable to the
city, I would attempt to get agreement of all the relevant
parties,'' he said. ``Several ideas were on the table without any
commitment on my part that they could be implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said he had merely asked city officials to select one of
the three ideas as the basis for a possible compromise he would
then attempt to sell to his board.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, the museum's director, said on Monday night that he
first learned of Rubin's discussion with city officials from the
news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we heard this,'' he said, ``we said: 'This is nothing.
We're not making any agreement. We're not doing anything.' We're
moving forward as we originally planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman added, however, that he and Rubin had been talking over
the idea of accepting a 20 percent cut in the city's subsidy, and
that they had even raised this possibility with the City Council
speaker, Peter Vallone. ``We talked about that last week with the
speaker,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman said he was also open to the possibility of segregating
from the rest of the exhibit those works that have stirred the most
anger and opposition. Such steps have been taken at other museums,
he said, without compromising the artistic integrity of those
exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you I'm concerned about this picture,'' he said
of Ofili's rendering of the Virgin Mary. ``I'm concerned that
people have such passionate feelings about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of Lehman's aides were stunned by word of the
negotiations and vehemently denied that the museum had agreed to
withdraw the Virgin Mary painting, which has been condemned as
blasphemous by several Catholic leaders in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not withdrawing any of the works in the exhibition,''
said Sally Williams, a spokeswoman for the museum. ``None of the
works are being withdrawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hillary Rodham Clinton joined on Monday in denouncing
Giuliani's threat to cut city financing to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feelings of being offended should not lead to the
penalizing and shutting down of an entire museum,'' said Mrs.
Clinton, who is likely to run against Giuliani for U.S. Senate next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, appearing at a news conference in Harlem, added:
``I share the feeling that I know many New Yorkers have that there
are parts of this exhibition that would be deeply offensive. I
would not go to see this exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani seized on Mrs. Clinton's remarks, suggesting to
reporters that the first lady, who is Methodist, was countenancing
attacks on Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, then she agrees with using public funds to attack and
bash the Catholic religion,'' Giuliani said outside Hunter College
in Manhattan.``There is no way out of this. These public funds are
being used to aggressively bash the religious views of a
significant number of people in this city and state and country.
And the question is, can taxpayer dollars be used for this kind of
disgusting, anti-religious _ in some ways really aggressively
anti-religious _ kind of demonstration?''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement on Monday, Rubin said that ``the ideals
of the institution are not on the bargaining table.'' But later, in
an interview, Rubin said he had indeed broached the possibility of
removing the painting, something other museum officials had vowed
for days would never happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the mayor had selected this painting by Chris Ofili as
the symbol of his disagreements with this exhibit, I felt that it
might be possible from his point of view that removing the symbol
of his disagreement with the museum might satisfy the city's
requirements to let us proceed with the exhibit,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting took place late Monday afternoon in the office of
Corporation Counsel Michael Hess. Also at the meeting was Schuyler
Chapin, commissioner of the city's Department of Cultural Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a meeting with Schuyler Chapin and Mr. Rubin, and we
discussed how to possibly resolve this dispute, and Mr. Rubin came
up with three separate ideas upon how to resolve this and I told
him that we would consider it if it was all three ideas,'' Hess
said. ``Not one, not two, but all three ideas. He said that was
okay and I discussed that with some of my staff and I came back to
him and said that those three ideas that he had come up with
together made up a proposal that I could live with. He said fine
and that he would take it back to his board members.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess added: ``I asked him, `Are you proposing A, B and C?' He
said yes, and I said I am telling my client about that.''
</P>
<P>
   According to city officials, if the museum board agreed to the
three provisions, Giuliani would then agree to abandon any efforts
to assume control of the board. The mayor would also end efforts to
cut all city funding to the museum, which this year amounts to
about $7 million a year toward operating expenses and another $20
million toward capital improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said city officials misinterpreted his remarks at the
meeting. He said he left without giving them a firm commitment to
make any recommendations to the museum board. ``What did I agree to
do when I left the meeting? I agreed that I would think about how I
could sell this to the relevant parties,'' he said, adding that ``I
have offered nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stressing that ``each one of these three items was my idea,''
Rubin said he thought, ``based on my 40 years experience as an
investment banker,'' that one of them ``might fly'' with both the
mayor and the members of his board, who are scheduled to meet at
the museum on Tuesday at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the discussions followed days of intense debate
throughout the city about freedom of expression and whether the
mayor has the right to withhold public funding from artistic
institutions that display art he finds offensive.

TWO POWERS IN QUARTER-HORSE RACING, ONCE PARTNERS, HAVE FOUND
SEPARATE WAYS TO THE TOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the equivalent of the Jerry Jones-Jimmy Johnson split
that rocked the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   When jockey Jacky Martin and trainer Jack Brooks ended their
relationship in 1993 as the most powerful combination in the
history of quarter-horse racing _ highlighted by a record six
victories in the All American Futurity at New Mexico's Ruidoso
Downs _ the entire industry was shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew what was going on between them,'' said trainer
Rodney Reed, remembering the summer of 1994 when Martin was trying
to hustle rides at Remington Park in Oklahoma City. ``I just knew
that Jacky showed up and was wanting to get up on a lot of horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell he wanted to ride and do good.''
</P>
<P>
   He has, though it has taken some time. The same thing could be
said for Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   After the split, each stumbled through a three-year slump.
Although still mostly working separately from one another, they're
back at the top and have a chance to cap off a successful year when
the quarter-horse season starts Friday at Lone Star Park at Grand
Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good opportunity. The purses at Lone Star average more
than $140,000 per day, and that's the highest of any track that
races quarter horses.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks and Martin lost their grasp on big purses during the
three years after their breakup, which stemmed from a rocky period
in Martin's personal life. For both, that stretch between 1994 and
'96 was practically their worst since they won their first All
American Futurity in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1997, even though both are largely on their own, they
have found a way to get back to the top. In each case, their
per-year earnings have averaged more than any other period in their
career.
</P>
<P>
   Horses trained by Brooks, a 64-year-old who's based near Edmond,
Okla., earned $2.2 million last year. He's at more than $800,000
this year. Last year's total was the highest since his last All
American victory with Martin on Dash Thru Traffic in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks has even won an All American again since then. With G.R.
Carter riding, he won last year's All American with Falling In
Loveagain.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, now living in Weatherford, almost won the All American
this year with a horse trained by Reed. After a tardy break from
the starting gates, Martin got Chicks Call Me rolling and finished
second by a nose to A Delightful Dasher in this year's All
American.
</P>
<P>
   For both of them, it's almost like the old times.
\Nsubheds:Rocky marriage, shocking split The start of the 1993
racing season at Ruidoso looked promising for Martin and Brooks.
They both teamed to win the Kansas Derby, one of the major stakes
races early in the Ruidoso meet.
</P>
<P>
   But the tension already had built around the Brooks stable.
Martin's marriage had fallen apart in nasty fashion. His
father-in-law was one of Brooks' major clients, and it was clear he
was uncomfortable with Martin's riding his horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trained so many for them that I couldn't keep riding
Jacky,'' Brooks said. ``We had it so good for so long. It was a bad
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the split. And while it shocked plenty of quarter-horse
fans, people close to the situation could see it coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no big fall-out,'' Martin said. ``Me and Jack didn't
have no cuss fight. But I still haven't gotten over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin wanted Brooks to put his foot down. For as long as they
had been together, Martin thought Brooks should have ``handed the
bridles over'' to his clients.
</P>
<P>
   But if Jones thought that any one of hundreds of coaches could
lead the Cowboys to a Super Bowl victory when he split with
Johnson, Brooks knew that there were plenty of jockeys who could
ride his horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had good riders that were riding second for me,''
Brooks said. ``I knew that I was in a position to do pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hating to lose Jacky. But this made him tend to
business. I know he's stronger for it. We're still real good
friends.'' \Nsubheds:Part-time reunion There are reasons for their
comebacks. Though 44 years old, Martin keeps in peak physical
condition. Unlike former quarter-horse trainers D. Wayne Lukas and
Bob Baffert, Brooks has ignored the urge to train thoroughbreds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the look of a quarter horse,'' Brooks said. ``I love
their speed. They're more of an athlete than a thoroughbred. That
awkwardness _ quarter horses can't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this game, and I keep looking for an All American
Futurity winner every year.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidenced by Brooks' decision to stick with his clients when
the split with Martin occurred, the clientele means so much for a
trainer. One owner who has joined with Brooks, Pat Sorrels of
Kingsland, spent $550,000 for a yearling in September at Ruidoso.
It was the highest yearling purchase of the year. Another client
spent $355,000 for a yearling in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RThe $550,000 yearling\S looks the part,'' Brooks said. ``I
told \RSorrels\S she'd bring a half a million. She was straight
\Rlegged\S. Everything was correct. She'd likely be a runner.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks has plenty of horses, so many that Carter can't ride all
of them. When Brooks qualified Rare King and Dashing Perfection in
the trials of the 1997 Rainbow Derby, Carter chose to ride Rare
King in the final. So Brooks asked Martin if he wanted to ride
Dashing Perfection. He did, and they won.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin has plenty of horses to ride. Instead of riding for
one trainer like he did with Brooks, he's often on horses for
trainers such as Reed, Dwayne ``Sleepy'' Gilbreath, James Lackey
and John Steinbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbreath won an All American Futurity with Refrigerator, but he
has lost enough of those races to Martin to know that if you can't
beat them, join them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat me so many dang times, that I knew that if Jacky
Martin ever became available, I was gonna get him to ride for me,''
Gilbreath said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbreath wasn't the only one. Though Martin hasn't quite won
the All American again since the split, he has made another major
inroad in racing history on what was once considered an ordinary
horse.
</P>
<P>
   SLM Big Daddy once was running for a claiming price before he
won some minor stakes races in 1996. But the horse's connections
sought out Martin, and he has won quarter-horse racing's most
important race for older horses _ the Champion of Champions _ each
of the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has become the Bill Shoemaker of quarter-horse racing.
Shoemaker rode a Kentucky Derby winner in his 50s, and age hasn't
caught up to Martin.
</P>
<P>
   It's partly his physical conditioning. And it might also be that
there aren't that many young, up-and-coming riders in quarter-horse
racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a dying breed,'' said Lackey, who rode for 23 years along
with Martin. ``You go through that jock's room and there are more
older riders than younger ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said he's still looking for the next All American
Futurity winner. So's Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do take time off sometimes,'' Martin said, ``but there's
nothing I'd rather do than get on a good racehorse.''
</P>
<P>
   So he'll keep on doing it, even if Brooks isn't the trainer
giving him the leg up anymore.

A NIGHT ON THE BRINK FOR SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-RED SOX-ORIOLES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the night the Red Sox clinched at least a tie for a playoff
spot, there was a wide divergence of opinion on Pedro Martinez, the
man who brought the Sox to that point with a 5-3 win over the
Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the difference came down to this:
</P>
<P>
   From the sellout crowd of 33,477 attending the Sox' final
regular-season home game and treated to Martinez's 23d win and 12
more strikeouts in eight innings: Pedro is MVP.
</P>
<P>
   From the office of visiting manager Ray Miller of the Orioles:
Pedro is a ``skinny little (potty-mouth synonym for punk).''
</P>
<P>
   Miller was steamed because Martinez, who didn't walk a batter,
plunked Brady Anderson between the numbers with a fastball in the
fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro my ass,'' Miller said. ``Pedro hit my leadoff hitter
right in the middle of the (indecorous adjective) back, when he's
only walked 37 batters all (same indecorous adjective) year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been watching this guy for 10 years and every good game
he pitches he hits some good hitter right in the middle of the
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Those comments were relayed to Martinez, who had exchanged words
with Anderson in the eighth inning, when Anderson nudged him with
an elbow while crossing the plate on a passed ball. That emptied
the benches and bullpens for some milling around, a scene spiked by
Martinez flexing his right biceps for plate umpire Gary Cederstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Said Miller of Martinez, ``If he had enough (vulgar anatomical
description) to cover home plate, he would have died right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez wondered whether Miller was aware of his whereabouts as
Anderson was crossing the plate and catcher Jason Varitek's throw
went past the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I covered it,'' he said. ``I covered the plate. I didn't even
see (Anderson). If he wanted to start something, he could have
right there. But Brady knows it's part of the game. The ball just
hit him. That's it. Brady stands right on top of the plate. He's
been hit all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray Miller is just a frustrated man.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Martinez threw a doozy of a counterpunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Ray Miller has to say, he should say managing his team,''
Martinez said. ``That's a pretty damn good team to manage, and it
didn't do (pungent barnyard epithet).
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wants to take out his frustrations, let him take it out
managing, not at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston hasn't had an outbreak of manners this bad since . . .
well, the weekend Ryder Cup hoo-ha. Portions of the Fenway crowd,
in fact, acted at times as though they had been imported direct
from The Country Club in Brookline. Bleacherites gave the Colin
Montgomerie treatment to Albert Belle, serenading the Orioles'
designated villain on a night when Belle whiffed three times and
rolled out once, making him 0 for 11 lifetime against Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   There also were two incidents of idiots running onto the field,
one of whom nearly caused Orioles rookie Jerry Hairston, who was at
the plate at the time, to jump out of his skin. Perhaps a prudent
response, given what happened last week in Milwaukee, where
Houston's Bill Spiers suffered whiplash at the hands of a ballfield
trespasser.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he heard of Miller's comments, Red Sox manager Jimy
Williams was already freshly showered and dressed for the team's
trip to Chicago, where it can clinch the wild-card spot outright
with a win Tuesday night over the White Sox, or an Oakland loss at
home against the Angels _ which offers the scenario of a Mo Vaughn
home run putting the Sox in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just another manager's comments,'' Williams said. ``Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just try to take care of our own, that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams flipped through some stat sheets on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that, his eighth?'' Williams asked, alluding to the
number of batters hit by Martinez pitches this season.
</P>
<P>
   Then he scanned the Orioles' stats. ``He's got a guy with 11.
(Scott) Erickson.''
</P>
<P>
   Erickson, in fact, was the loser Monday night, giving up a home
run and two-run double to catcher Jason Varitek, a home run to
Brian Daubach, and three hits to Damon Buford, including an RBI
double.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't hit anyone in a Sox uniform, although Nomar
Garciaparra and Trot Nixon were both hit Saturday, and Garciaparra
sat out Monday &UR;  &LR; night's game with a sore right wrist. There also
was this: Anderson, in the view of the Red Sox, had leaned into a
fastball from Tim Wakefield on Sunday, just before Mike Bordick's
two-run double in a five-run Orioles uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Payback?
</P>
<P>
   ``You said that, not me,'' Martinez said sternly. ``I knew
nothing about that. This wasn't a good night for me. I threw a
couple of pitches away from the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, who used to defend Martinez against
head-hunting accusations in Montreal, kept his comments to a
minimum when informed of Miller's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our shortstop couldn't play, that's my only response,''
Kerrigan said. ``Selective memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who lowered his major league-leading ERA to 2.08 with
a yield of two runs (only one earned), threw 121 pitches before
being dismissed in favor of Derek Lowe, who gave up a run in the
ninth but came out with his team-leading 15th save.
</P>
<P>
   The win was the Sox' 90th of the season, traditionally a
benchmark of excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Toronto, we won 96 games one year and went home,''
Williams said. ``The benchmark is to go to the playoffs. That's the
benchmark.''
</P>
<P>
   So, does it happen tonight in Comiskey Park?
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never make predictions,'' Varitek said. ``But we'll go
out swinging.''

LONGHORNS COACH SAYS TEAM'S IDENTITY STILL UNKNOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Texas football coach Mack Brown watched his Longhorns
rout Baylor, 62-0, Saturday and jump seven places in The Associated
Press poll to No. 15.
</P>
<P>
   But after five games, four of which produced victories, Brown
still is trying to figure out how good this team is.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the Longhorns' wins were routs, the Baylor game and a
69-17 victory against Stanford. They also lost the opener to North
Carolina State, 23-20, suffered a letdown in the second half of a
38-21 victory against Rutgers and barely got past Rice, 18-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not as bad as people thought after the Rice game,''
Brown said. ``We're not as good as people thought after the
Stanford or Baylor games. Somewhere in between is where we really
fit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns should find out just where they are this week,
when 13th-ranked Kansas State comes to town.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the last two games and how can you tell anything
about this team?'' Brown said. ``I have no idea who's going to show
up Saturday. It's hard for me to get a bead on whether we're any
good or not.''
\Nsubheds:Defensive depth The Longhorns shut out the Bears even
though linebacker Aaron Babino, safeties Quentin Jammer and Chris
Butcher and cornerback Joe Walker didn't play because of injuries,
even though defensive tackle Aaron Humphrey sat out the second half
and even though they were able to play a lot of young players
because of the big lead.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that's an indication of how much better the defensive
depth is this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``To play without Joe Walker, Quentin Jammer, Chris Butcher,
Aaron Babino and Aaron Humphrey last year, we would have had to
call the game off because we didn't have anybody to put in their
place,'' he said. ``That means we are making some progress. Anytime
you shut somebody out and play so many guys, that's exciting.''
\Nsubheds:Ike No. 2 Kenny Hayter, a freshman, got the bulk of the
work as the backup to Hodges Mitchell against Baylor while Victor
Ike carried just five times. But Brown said that Ike, a redshirt
freshman who carried 55 times for 214 yards in the first four
games, remains the second-string tailback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victor only touching it five times didn't have anything to do
with Victor,'' Brown said. ``We wanted to let Kenny get some
experience because we may need him before the year is over.''

COWBOYS' AIKMAN SAYS CARDINALS NOT NECESSARILY ON SUPER BOWL PATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Quarterback Troy Aikman looks at the Cowboys'
opponent this week and sees a good football team, certainly a
legitimate contender for the NFC East title.
</P>
<P>
   What Aikman and his laser-repaired eyes don't see in the Arizona
Cardinals, however, is a team that is ``turning it around,''
despite a hapless-to-happy 1998 campaign that culminated with a
20-7 victory over the Cowboys in the wild-card playoff.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, 1-2 after a 24-10 loss to San Franciso last
night, are looking to prove that the playoff victory was no upset.
And many of the Cowboys, who come off a bye week, are looking for
some payback for the season-ruining playoff loss.
</P>
<P>
   However, winning a playoff game for the first time in 51 years
is one thing. Winning consistently in the regular season, winning a
division title and ultimately winning a Super Bowl are the
differences between the Cowboys and the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tendency any time a team gets over the hump so to
speak that people want to try and say, `Do you see yourself back in
'91 or '92','' Aikman said. ``We accomplished a great deal in a
very short period of time. No one had done that before us. No one
has done it since. I think it's throwing compliments a little
prematurely.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman said that he is not picking on the Cardinals and that
they are just the latest team christened as ``next year's
champions.'' Aikman pointed out that Tampa Bay lived down to such
expectations last season by not even making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of teams that they want to crown as next
year's champions or the next dynasty that never even get to that
point where you can say they're a great football team,'' Aikman
said.
</P>
<P>
   For the Cardinals to be great, they have to not only build on
what they accomplished last year but raise their standards to the
level of other perennial contenders like the Cowboys, Green Bay and
San Francisco, Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After last year, they can look back and say `Boy, we really
made some progress; we're doing some things right','' Aikman said.
``But now this year, their standards pretty much fall in line along
with the top teams in the league. With those teams, it ultimately
comes down to whether or not you win the Super Bowl. Just winning a
playoff game is no longer the criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   That the Cardinals won that wild-card playoff game in dominating
fashion was the foundation for the preseason talk of a changing of
the guard in the NFC East. Even though the Cardinals actually lost
two of three meetings to the Cowboys last year, the bandwagon
picked the Cardinals, led by the next-great quarterback, Jake
Plummer, to win their first division title since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys defensive back Darren Woodson, who said the loss tainted
what had been a record-setting season in which the Cowboys became
the first team to sweep their way to the NFC East title, said he
and his teammates will be looking to make a statement Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a revenge factor?'' Woodson said. ``Yes. We beat them
twice but the one loss was the last game of the season. It still
burns in our mind. Everybody looked at them as the NFC East
champion.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, the loss ended the Cowboys' season. That's
something that lingered in the minds of many Cowboys players
throughout the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disappointing,'' middle linebacker Randall Godfrey
said. ``They knocked us out of the playoffs. They came in and
embarrassed us in our own back yards. We owe them one. We'll be
ready for them.''

INTERNET-BASED FIRMS LEADING MEDIA'S FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a sprawling, sleek warren of offices in a Santa
Monica warehouse, dozens of young people hunch over Macintosh G3
computers, busily creating the future of entertainment _ and Los
Angeles' economy.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, their company _ Digital Entertainment Network, or
DEN _ had just 25 employees. Today, it has more than 200, and wants
to hire an additional 100 in the next month, said company President
David Neuman.
</P>
<P>
   While a four-day conference began Monday in Beverly Hills to
show how DEN and other Internet companies can revive the
entertainment industry, a group of top business and political
leaders met at Universal City to discuss how to gird Hollywood
against runaway production and preserve its dominance.
</P>
<P>
   The old and new media exploit what Los Angeles does best:
create.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future, the key is going to be content,'' Jack Kyser,
chief economist of the Los Angeles County Economic Development
Corp. ``You have all these Web sites, and they've got to have the
eyeballs come back again if they're going to survive. And content
is one thing we in Los Angeles are very, very good at.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as DEN are opening shop on the Internet and
creating good-paying jobs in whole new arenas. These new
Internet-based media companies, observers say, will help keep Los
Angeles on top of the entertainment business and even give the city
a claim as the capital of the new media age.
</P>
<P>
   Internet-based media companies are the stars of the Digital
Hollywood conference at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, sponsored by the
Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association and focusing on the
merger of the television and computer and Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On a parallel track, city officials and legislators attended a
discussion hosted by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences to
figure out how to keep movie production in Los Angeles. Assemblyman
Scott Wildman, D-Glendale, has authored one of two bills that would
offer tax credits to California-based TV and film projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually believe we have a good opportunity to push this not
only at a state level, but at a national level. Hollywood has stood
up,'' Wildman said. ``Unlike 42 countries, in California we don't
have any incentives for the entertainment industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Shea, president of the Director's Guild of America, said
the migration of film crews could have lasting effects in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The infrastructure is here, and if it starts to wither away it
is not going to affect us right this moment, it will affect us 10
years down the line,'' said Shea, who called for federal government
intervention on a par with incentives, like labor rebates, that the
Canadian National Government offers the film industry.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Neuman is concerned, the Internet is a savior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this whole industry is a sleeping giant that will be
an overwhelming positive for Southern California,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Southland already has some media giants _ the networks and
studios _ who are likely to get in on the action.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Tercek, vice president of technology for Columbia TriStar
who heads their online efforts, said DEN, New York's Pseudo.com and
others are perfect takeover targets for the big studios and
networks.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that the studios and networks would see such
acquisitions as a quick way to do programming in a medium where
they so far have done little.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a universe of 50,000 channels, the 500 that are going to
make it are the ones with the access to marketing muscle,'' Trecek
said. ``And the ones with marketing muscle are the studios and
networks.''
</P>
<P>
   The content that DEN (at !bold!www.den.net!off!) is creating is
essentially a new kind of online mixed media. It combines
semiweekly, six-minute video episodes similar to television with
areas where viewers can chat with each other, buy clothing and
gear, play games and more, all more or less at the same time. In
all, it's putting together 30 different kinds of programs, each
focused on a well-defined slice of youth culture, from Christian
teens (``Redemption High'') to skate punks (``Aggronation'') to
college kids (``Frat Ratz'').
</P>
<P>
   Other firms _ such as Steeplechase Media in Santa Monica,
WireBreak Networks in Venice and Spike Networks in Hollywood _ have
also sprung up in recent months, creating their own kinds of
new-media experiences.
</P>
<P>
   A series of recent national studies have placed the Los Angeles
area second only to the San Francisco-Silicon Valley area for
technology jobs. L.A. already employs more than 130,000 such
people, and observers say the business here is only going to
increase as the Internet becomes faster, easier to use and more
widely embraced, and as existing movie, music, special effects and
television companies diversify onto the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Jason McCabe Calcanis, publisher of the New York-based Silicon
Alley Reporter and its Southern California offshoot, Digital Coast
Reporter, proclaims the future belongs to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   That's because most of the Northern California Internet
companies now making headlines and billionaires create what
Calcanis calls ``plumbing,'' the machinery and computer programs
that allow the Internet to function. What they don't create is what
people increasingly will seek on the Net: entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a very big market,'' said Calcanis, though
it will be at least a couple of years before large numbers of
people have the high-speed broadband connections to the Internet
that allow high-quality video similar to what people have watched
for years on television, while allowing two-way interactions that
television will never provide.

   ``The Internet today is anemic,'' Calcanis said. ``That lends
itself to New York's strengths in publishing and music. But as we
all know, the Net is getting faster and broadband will play to
L.A.'s strengths. The truth is, the Internet means nothing but for
the creatives.''
</P>
<P>
   And while some jobs are being lost because of runaway
production, new jobs with different skills are likely to be
created. Digital training centers at UCLA, the University of
Southern California and the American Film Institute are a few of
the places where workers can get training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the resources we have,'' Kyser said. ``The idea is
that the creativity is here. You also find that creative people
like to cluster, like to talk to one another. They have a different
lifestyle, too. A lot of these other places around the U.S. may
talk a good game, but they're not that open to (that kind of
openness).''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Tercek and others say, the role of broadcast
channels and Web sites may dramatically change, with over-the-air
networks becoming ``barker channels.'' Through advertisement and
promotion they would direct their larger audiences to more
specialized Web sites of narrower demographic slices that would
appeal to top advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the networks and studios have set up Web sites to
promote programs and films but little else. Recently, Sony began
netcasting enhanced interactive versions of two of its biggest TV
properties, ``Jeopardy'' and ``Wheel of Fortune,'' and other
companies such as Viacom have announced substantial additions to
their Web presences, including a broader MTV site _ although so far
they have not created programs distinctively different from what
their broadcasts provide. Which is why they're looking at companies
like DEN.

AUTHOR WRITES ABOUT GREAT BOSSES, RULES HIMSELF OUT

 Attn: Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Louis and other users of Dale
Dauten columns   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JON KAMMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Not all bosses are jerks. A few are great, believe it
or not, and many are simply ``a sap'' like writer Dale Dauten says
he was when he owned a thriving market-research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``My employees loved me. I was much taken advantage of. I was
overpaying them and letting them do whatever they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, they loved me,'' muses the self-styled ``Corporate
Curmudgeon,'' as he calls the seriocomic newspaper column he writes
from the office of his Tempe, Ariz., home. The weekly column on the
foibles of America's workplaces runs in 30 newspapers across the
country, including ``The Arizona Republic,'' the ``Chicago
Tribune,'' the ``Minneapolis Star Tribune'' and the ``St. Louis
Post-Dispatch.'' He also co-authors another syndicated column with
even wider circulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was  &UR; not &LR;  a gifted boss,'' Dauten says with an authority
that comes from years of exploring what, exactly, it takes to be
one.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in his fourth book, ``The Gifted Boss: How to Find, Create,
and Keep Great Employees,'' Dauten distills into little more than
100 pages of plain-spoken insight and unpretentious wit what he has
learned about transcending mediocrity _ not to mention avoiding
being a jerk or sap _ in the complex task of managing people.
</P>
<P>
   The new book, coupled with a loyal following of his columns and
wide exposure via his interactive Web site (would-be climbers of
corporate ladders can take a test at www.dauten.com to gauge their
promotability), has suddenly propelled Dauten beyond his first love
_ writing _ and increasingly onto the stage as a professional
speaker at corporate gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   He's delivering half a dozen speeches across the nation in an
eight-week period, and is a finalist for a booking in Paris. He
observes wryly that his fee of $7,500 per talk still puts him ``in
the bargain bin'' at about one-fifth the rate charged by another
Phoenix-area resident, can-do business columnist Harvey Mackay, and
one-tenth that of Tom Peters, the acclaimed guru of excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't call his commentaries, which he delivers from a stool
a la Garrison Keillor, ``motivational speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I make fun of motivational speakers,'' he said. ``I believe
people are self-motivated; you can't give it to them in a speech.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Gifted,'' Dauten calls upon his alter ego, the fictional
sage Max Elmore he introduced in his 1996 book, ``The Max
Strategy,'' to impart the keys to being a superboss. Through
focused conversation and easy repartee, plus visits to a couple of
Valley workplaces, Max does so in just 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, it took the 48-year-old Dauten a lot longer to get
the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   Academically, he was a whiz even beyond what could be expected
of the son of an Arizona State University business professor and a
devoted homemaker mother. By age 21, he had completed bachelor's
and master's degrees in economics at ASU and was enrolled in a
doctoral program at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Not ready to commit to the professorial life, he came back to
the Phoenix area and went to work.
</P>
<P>
   Dauten admits having failed to recognize that his first boss, an
explosive executive at the Phoenix headquarters of U-Haul's parent,
Amerco, was truly gifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was terrified instead of inspired by him. His displays of
temper and other extremes of good-old-boy phenomena just left me
appalled,'' Dauten said. ``I could have learned more from him,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   When the young market researcher moved on, he fit in better at
the old Armour-Dial Inc., a subsidiary of Phoenix-based Greyhound
Corp. during the mid-1970s. He rose within a couple of years to
manager of market research for a company that was racking up
successes rolling out such products as new antiperspirants and
Coast soap. It sent him to New York for a week of specialized
training every month.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he was noticed as a star performer, or ``Wild Brain'' as
he calls it in his book, and was recruited by a national
market-research firm. That started his career in consulting, first
in Dallas and then, with another company, in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would gather all these tables of numbers around me, and they
would speak to me,'' he recalled as if from a past life.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath his numbers wizardry, however, lay a deep yearning to
write.
</P>
<P>
   By age 30, he had founded his own market-research firm in
Atlanta, become a father and somehow found time to write his first
book, ``Quitting,'' ``a study of big changes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was done in a market-research type of way,'' Dauten said,
``and it showed I needed to learn how to write. I was still an
academic _ the longer the word, the longer the sentence, the more
profound it must be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assumed that if I wrote a book of any substance it would
find an audience.'' It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole career has been characterized by naivete,'' confesses
the man who now finds himself giving career advice. He collaborates
with New York job counselor Kate Wendleton to produce ``Kate &AMP; Dale
Talk Jobs,'' a weekly question-and-answer column appearing in more
than 100 newspapers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm telling people how to manage, how to live their
lives?'' he asked mockingly.
</P>
<P>
   He knocks himself for not having realized years ago that the
employees of his multimillion-dollar company should have been
solving most of their work problems themselves instead of dumping
them on him. And he confesses that as a boss, he wasn't even
resolute enough to make it stick when he fired an employee he
remembers as chronically undependable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fired her half a dozen times, and she kept coming back,''
Dauten said. It was his wife, Sandy, now a leading saleswoman for
Shea Homes and a plenty dependable mother for their two teenage
boys still at home and a 19-year-old daughter who has left the
nest.
</P>
<P>
   Although his Atlanta firm had only five employees and was a
pioneer in farming out volumes of work before ``outsourcing'' was
even a common business term, it projected a big business image
through a quarterly newsletter. That helped reel in and retain such
powerhouse clients as Procter &AMP; Gamble, AT&AMP;T, McDonald's, Gil
lette, Colgate and Coors.
</P>
<P>
   Dauten says it was because he started running out of serious
ideas for the newsletter that he began writing tongue-in-cheek
commentaries. Clients were delighted, one likening them to the work
of the era's consummate curmudgeon, Andy Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the mid-1980s, Dauten authored a second book, this one
far more readable, called ``Taking Chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale of his business to employees in 1988 gave the family
resources to move almost anywhere, he says. After a halting stint
in the Los Angeles area, the choice was to come home to Tempe,
where he had grown up from age 10, graduated from McClintock High
School and where he and Sandy had met at ASU.
</P>
<P>
   His love of the city eventually turned into six years of service
on its Planning and Zoning Commission. Term limits ended his tenure
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Dauten's ``Corporate Curmudgeon'' column first got ink eight
years ago after Jim Fickess, now a team leader in the Business
section of ``The Arizona Republic,'' agreed to run it when he was
business editor at Tribune Newspapers in suburban Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year later, Dauten got a call from King Features
Syndicate in New York offering him a contract. Until his column
went into national syndication, it hadn't paid him a penny.
</P>
<P>
   As the Corporate Curmudgeon, doing take-offs on memos to
employees from the pompous managerial ranks of Mundane Industries,
Dauten can wield a saber as sharply ticklish as Dilbert's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The examined life is a process of peeling away the layers of
stupidity,'' he observes in ``Gifted.''
</P>
<P>
   He also is a wordsmith who, in a touching column written from an
employee's viewpoint, tells bosses everywhere, ``I only work for
people who look up to me, even from the top floor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an affirmation that, hey, I'm not alone out here battling
these forces against us,'' said ardent fan Dan Hagerman, who worked
his way into management after starting 20 years ago as a
deliveryman in the food-service business.
</P>
<P>
   Hagerman discovered Dauten's columns in Minneapolis before
moving to Scottsdale three years ago, and credits them as one of
the influences behind his shift to a new career: conducting
training programs for corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   Dauten is hard-pressed to define how he came by his ability to
inspire through humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always was a wise-ass _ that much came naturally,'' he
offers with one of the impish smiles that break readily above a
sharp chin and graying goatee. It also helped that, along with many
of the rewards of business success, he had steady doses of
corporate America's euphemistic jargon and eternal politicking.
</P>
<P>
   Once, a company paid him $10,000 to research whether the prize
it would be giving away in a contest should be a teddy bear or a
unicorn.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Here's a coin; why don't you just flip it?,' I wanted to
tell them,'' Dauten says with a shrug. They had referred the
monumental question to him, he later learned, because rival
executives had differed on the choice of a prize and subordinates
were afraid to align themselves with either one until they had
market data in hand to justify their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Reader response to his columns keeps him well stocked with
material about the best and worst of the business world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a stream of letters from employees _ mostly
dissatisfied, many out of work _ and I get wonderful ideas from
managers and entrepreneurs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here in the delta of ideas and information, and I get to
pick what to write about.'' &QL;

L.A. BRACES FOR STAPLES OPENING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the Staples Center scheduled to open in three
weeks, Los Angeles officials were told Wednesday to expect
confusion among drivers during the first months the arena is
opened, as well as a potential parking conflict with the auto show
in January.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council's Ad Hoc Committee on the Los Angeles Arena was
assured that the city was prepared to make changes as problems
develop _ including creation of a permit parking area _ in
neighboring residential areas.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Rifkin of the city's Department of Transportation, said a
team of traffic and police officials has been formed to monitor all
traffic in and out of the arena, particularly during the first
months of operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As people become familiar with downtown and the best way to
get to Staples, we think a lot of the initial problems will go
away,'' Rifkin said.
</P>
<P>
   He said there will be message boards and signs directing people
to and from the 20,000-seat facility as well as a series of shuttle
buses from remote parking.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Rita Walters, in whose district the facility is
located, voiced concern about what she saw as a lack of planning on
mass departures from the arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will be arriving at all different times, but they will
be leaving at the same time,'' Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they have set a time line of emptying all parking
lots within 45 minutes after the event and believe that can be met.
Emptying of Dodger Stadium takes 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Hernandez said he is concerned about the impact
on the auto show, which is one of the biggest tenants of the
adjacent Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to consider the impact on the auto show,'' Hernandez
said. ``It is a very important event for the city and, from the
very beginning, concern was expressed about the impact of the arena
on this event.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Liewecke, president of the Los Angeles Arena Co., said some
parking spaces at the Convention Center has been lost to the auto
show, but has been made up with other spaces directly across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said, Staples Center will be closed during four days of
the show.
</P>
<P>
   However, a representative of the auto show complained that the
Los Angeles Clippers will play the Indiana Pacers on Jan. 8, the
first day of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Feuer also raised the issue of increased costs
to the city for traffic control.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Staples Center would cover any costs for areas
where traffic increases by more than 10 percent.

`GIFTED' BOSSES FOUND HERE AND THERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
The Gifted Boss: How to Find, Create and Keep Great Employees 
By Dale Dauten (William Morrow and Co., $20) 
 
 By JON KAMMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Syndicated business columnist Dale Dauten's ``The Gifted Boss''
opens with a set of characteristics so uncomplicated they fit on a
single page. It's through the rest of his compact volume that the
ideals he calls ``The Six Realities of Gifted Bosses and Great
Employees'' come to life, illuminated by about 50 individuals and
companies.
</P>
<P>
   He found as many as a dozen of the examples in the balmy Phoenix
metropolitan area, where he lives, and the second-largest batch in
the Twin Cities area, where he has had business ties.
</P>
<P>
   Examples range from John Genzale, now editor of the national
magazine ``SportsBusiness Journal,'' who inspired better staff
writing by holding weekly poetry readings in the newsroom of the
Phoenix ``Business Journal,'' to Tempe-based Insight Group, whose
founding brothers built their headquarters in the shape of an X to
help ensure that employees from all sectors would cross paths.
</P>
<P>
   The book's most touching anecdote tells of the extraordinary
esprit de corps shown by Insight personnel, including Chief
Executive Eric Crown, when a key employee returned to work after
chemotherapy. Scores of co-workers, including women and the big
boss himself, had their heads shaved in solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps none of the gifted bosses Dauten writes about is a
perfect manager, he concedes, but each illustrates one or more
aspects of what it takes to be great. And sometimes, he points out,
the solution to a bad-boss trait is as simple as the advice he
quotes from former Porsche CEO Peter Schutz: ``Stop doing that!''
</P>
<P>
   The book's central message is that the highest function of a
boss is to create ``the best place for the best people to work''
and to focus unlimited attention on recruiting only the type of
people _ ``Wild Brains,'' Dauten calls them _ who immediately
become the star performers of whatever tasks they take on.
</P>
<P>
   As in Dauten's 1996 book, the equally slim and pithy ``The Max
Strategy: How a Businessman Got Stuck at an Airport and Learned to
Make His Career Take Off'' (the title was imposed on him, he says
ruefully), Dauten lets an eccentric oracle of management, the
fictional Max Elmore, serve as the agent of change. In both books,
the narrator, a middle manager who has caught a whiff of smoke from
impending burnout, represents the author himself at critical stages
of his career, Dauten says.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier book was a contemplation of career paths (skip the
rigid goal-setting exercises you read about elsewhere, because
success is ``usually an accident''); innovation (``experiments
never fail'' if you learn from them); and quality (a favorite
theme: ``Different isn't always better, but better is always
different'').
</P>
<P>
   In ``Gifted,'' retiree Max, described as ``a kid in an aging
body, fizzing with the wisdom of nearly eight decades of
curiosity,'' reconnects in Phoenix with his disciple.
</P>
<P>
   Readers will judge for themselves whether the Max persona rings
true or ultimately distracts as he repeatedly drives home points by
punching the narrator's shoulder, gripping his knee, putting a
fatherly arm around him during a stroll through downtown Phoenix or
jabbing a finger or fist into the air.
</P>
<P>
   But physicality aside, Max is one savvy interpreter of how an
earnest manager can keep everyone in an organization so blissfully
productive that the manager's own bosses ``lie awake at night and
thank the Lord that you work for them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental task of the best manager is not to manage,''
he counsels. ``The job of the gifted boss is to create a magnetic
environment, one capable of attracting great employees _ the kind
who don't need management, who lift up their co-workers and even
their boss.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Six Realities of Gifted Bosses and Great Employees'':
</P>
<P>
   1. The ``talent-squared'' workplace is possible because gifted
bosses and great employees want the same things from a workplace:
</P>
<P>
   _ Freedom from management, mediocrity and morons.
</P>
<P>
   _ A change.
</P>
<P>
   _ A chance.
</P>
<P>
   2. Gifted bosses don't just hire employees, they acquire allies.
</P>
<P>
   3. Great employees don't have jobs, they have talents. They
enter the job market once (if at all), and thereafter their talents
are spotted, courted and won over.

   4. Great bosses and employees often reverse the typical job
search: Instead of the employee doing the ``hunting,'' it's the
boss. The process more resembles a ``talent search'' than a ``job
market.''

   5. While many gifted bosses have created such special work
environments that they have virtually no turnover, many others
embrace substantial turnover and become masters of ``the secret
skill'' of firing.
</P>

   6. An alliance between a gifted boss and a great employee is a
kinship of talent, often creating a bond that can last a lifetime. &QL;

GOP HOPEFUL BAUER SEES RACE GETTING NASTY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ GOP presidential hopeful Gary Bauer said Monday
that he is the target of printed gossip that a current Republican
candidate is having an affair with a younger woman _ calling it a
``devastating'' and false allegation emanating from a rival
campaign.
<P>
   The former policy adviser to Ronald Reagan and president of the
conservative Family Research Council, in an interview with The
Chronicle Monday, forcefully addressed a gossip item printed in the
New York Daily News this week and repeated Monday in the National
Journal's Hotline.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News' Daily Dish column read: ``What presidential
candidate is praying that a former secretary doesn't go public with
her claim that he's been having an affair with a twentysomething
woman? Many on the married Republican's campaign staff are already
jumping ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, whose national campaign chair Charles Jarvis resigned
last week to work for rival GOP candidate Steve Forbes, was asked
whether he was the subject of the item.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's supposed to be me. And it's disgusting,'' said
the candidate without hesitation. ``It almost makes me physically
sick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I have been married for 27 years. We have three
children. I have been loyal to her, and she's been loyal to me all
those years,'' he added. ``And it is depressing that in American
politics, this sort of thing can be elevated to even that rung.''
</P>
<P>
   The gossip about Bauer _ and his forceful response _ may
illustrate how ferocious the GOP presidential race is becoming,
with six months still go to before the voters even cast a ballot in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer was in San Francisco Monday to deliver a foreign policy
address to the Commonwealth Club of California. He was met by a
standing ovation from a crowd of 70 after he called for revoking
China's most-favored nation trading status because of widespread
human rights abuses there.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer also said the withdrawal of Dan Quayle from the race may
earn him support from Republicans who believe Bauer is ``a GOP
conservative alternative to the front-runner.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after his speech, Bauer did not flinch when
asked about rumors _ floated at last weekend's state GOP convention
_ suggesting that the departure of his campaign chair related to
personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said that not only would an affair be wrong, but the
gossip ``doesn't pass the straight-face test. You'd have to be a
complete idiot to do something like this in the glare of a
presidential campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the sort of thing I hoped to avoid, because I think
it's why so many Americans are turned off about politics,'' he
said. ``It's disgusting. It's outrageous. It's trash-can
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked who might be responsible for such rumors, Bauer said, ``I
think it's coming from the camp of one of my political opponents,''
but he declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis told The Chronicle last week he resigned from Bauer's
campaign because Forbes had the political muscle _ and the message
_ to become the strongest conservative in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary's a very, very skilled guy ... (but) we are talking not
about the class president. We are talking the president of the
United States, and this is a watershed election,'' Jarvis said.
</P>
<P>
   But some political supporters have suggested that Bauer has been
the target of a vicious whisper campaign since he placed an
unexpectedly strong fourth in the Iowa Straw Poll and issued policy
directives like his own flat-tax initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer hinted at the matter when asked by a Commonwealth Club
audience member if he has enjoyed running for president.
</P>
<P>
   He said it has been ``the most incredibly positive thing you can
imagine, because you get to go all over the country and meet good
and decent people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's also a terrible, terrible downside,'' Bauer added.
``I would shock you if I told you all of the ... rumors that are
going on, and attacks on my integrity, things that have been said
about my family and my wife. I have one daughter in tears because
of things she's heard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``American politics more and more resembles the trash can,
rather than the kind of debates that Lincoln and Douglas had,'' he
told them. ``But I'm going to fight the good fight.'''

 MODERN MUTATING MICROBES GIVE VIRUSES A GLOBAL SPIN  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One of the more devilish microbes to emerge in
modern times turns out to be a virus capable of causing deadly
brain infections in animals and people, scientists said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Nipah virus, named for a village in Malaysia where
it struck in 1997, underscores the global problem of emerging
infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the central topics at the annual scientific
meeting of the American Society for Microbiology held this week in
San Francisco. About 16,000 doctors, researchers and drug company
representatives are attending.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's sessions included encouraging _ although highly
preliminary _ evidence on a potential new class of antibiotics for
battling drug-resistant bacteria. Another early-stage study showed
promising results for a new type of AIDS drug for those not helped
by conventional therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Every year or so, a mysterious disease outbreak is traced to a
previously unrecognized microbe somewhere around the world, said
C.J. Peters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Nipah virus was ``a lot scarier and more serious'' than the
others, Peters said, ``a wild card'' of a bug capable of jumping
easily from one species to another.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, it caused 284 cases of encephalitis in Malaysia,
killing 105 people, nearly all of whom were ethnic Chinese directly
involved in the hog-farming industry. In order to stem the
epidemic, authorities ordered some 1.2 million hogs destroyed and
razed several farms in the center of the afflicted zone.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak ran its course over about seven months. ``We think
it is contained and is no longer being transmitted,'' Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists are nowhere close to solving all the medical
mysteries presented by sometimes-deadly microbes.
</P>
<P>
   The Nipah virus, for example, appears to hide without causing
disease symptoms in a species of fruit-eating bat. Yet scientists
can only speculate as to why it emerged so suddenly and with such a
vengeance in pigs, and was then passed to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Some evidence suggests the problem was brought on by recent
changes in hog-farming techniques practiced in the Malaysian
countryside. Domestic or wild dogs _ along with farmers trying to
move stock out of harm's way _ then may have spread the virus from
one farm to the next.
</P>
<P>
   A repeat outbreak of illness seems inevitable, experts warned,
either from the Nipah virus or a previously unknown relative. At
the same time, existing pathogens pose new problems.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS virus, in particular, has been shown capable of
mutating into a drug-resistant form that can infect someone else.
Dr. Douglas Richman of the University of California at San Diego
reported growing evidence of more hard-to-treat infections.
</P>
<P>
   That helped set the stage for the latest results Monday from
drug developers trying to keep one step ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Early-stage testing of a drug called T-20, one of a new class of
anti-HIV drugs called fusion inhibitors, was tested in 55 people
who were taking combination AIDS drug therapies and who still had
high levels of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The viral loads fell below measurement capabilities in 20 of the
test subjects after four months, while dropping substantially in 33
others.
</P>
<P>
   But experts said the drug, which requires twice-daily injection,
may grant only a brief reprieve for patients with resistant forms
of infection. The drug is being developed by drug giant Hoffmann-La
Roche Inc. in a collaboration with Trimeris Inc., a Durham, N.C.,
biotech company.
</P>
<P>
   On the antibiotics front, drugmaker Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn said it
will seek approval later this year for Zyvox, which has shown to be
capable of killing germs resistant to common antibiotics, even
including vancomycin, which is now held in reserve as the
last-ditch defense against mutated pathogens.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox is a synthetic compound that disables bacteria by hitting
a different molecular target than current drugs on the market. It
works only against gram-positive bacteria, the cause of many
serious hospital infections, and nobody expects it to be the last
word.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a few cases of Zyvox-resistant microbes have been
found, scientists were told Monday.

EVERYONE'S TOO YOUNG OR TOO OLD
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ It's not my fault.
<P>
   It's not your fault, either. Nobody is to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Any bad deed or felony can be stricken from your files if you
happen to belong to one of the following groups:
</P>
<P>
   1. Young people (birth to about 50).
</P>
<P>
   2. Old people (50 to about 150).
</P>
<P>
   3. People who watch TV.
</P>
<P>
   Young people, thanks to politicians like George W. Bush and
Henry Hyde, can chalk up all bad stuff to youthful indiscretion.
``Youthful'' meaning you still had some of your original teeth
and/or hair at the time of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Old people are old, so we forgive their long-ago sins. It was
discovered recently that an English woman leaked nuclear secrets to
the Russians for decades, compromising the security of England and
Planet Earth. But the woman is over 80 now, so even though she's
unrepentant, they're not going to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   The TV excuse: A poll shows that Californians are fat and out of
shape, and 75 percent of those surveyed said that aggressive TV ads
are their main obstacle to healthy eating.
</P>
<P>
   Junk food takes us out of the kitchen, saving us tons of work
and time, leaving us more time for TV and lying around, and so goes
the circle of life.
</P>
<P>
   But don't blame me. I've aged a great deal over the past few
paragraphs.
</P>
<P>
   EARTH TO GUV: Gray Davis has no e-mail address. And now Citizen
Walt Bilofsky has discovered that Davis doesn't take phone
messages, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dial his published phone number,'' Walt says, ``press 2 to
leave your opinion, the system tells you to leave a message, then
it says it's not authorized to take a message!''
</P>
<P>
   I tried it. The robot told me: `'I'm sorry, the party you are
trying to reach cannot receive messages.''
</P>
<P>
   Makes sense. If Guv Davis doesn't want input from state
legislators, why would he want to hear from Walt Freaking Bilofsky?
</P>
<P>
   OUR RYDER CUP golf lads scored a dramatic victory over Europe on
Sunday and celebrated with whooping and champagne pouring.
</P>
<P>
   The vanquished Euros saw this as uncivilized and
unsportsmanlike.
</P>
<P>
   The easy thing to do would be to dismiss their complaints as the
bleating of crybabies, sore losers and whiners.
</P>
<P>
   So let's go with that.
</P>
<P>
   MARK McGWIRE hit 70 homers last year. But did you know that Joe
Bauman hit 72 in '54? With 224 RBIs, in 138 games.
</P>
<P>
   Joe hit 'em for Roswell (N.M). in the Longhorn League. He's one
of the amazing/amusing stories in ``Baseball's Forgotten Heroes,''
by Bay Area writer Tony Salin.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpt from Joe Bauman's story: ``They got a habit out there
(in Roswell), where if you hit a home run they'd stick a damn
dollar bill through that chicken wire. And you'd go around and pick
them up. And that got to be kind of lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first night there I hit a damn home run ... and went in
the dugout. A guy said, `Joe, go up there and get that money!'... I
didn't know what he was talking about. ... And I looked up there
and that money poked through there looked like Bermuda grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Please, nobody mention this to Barry Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   BIRD MAN of the Tenderloin: For seven years, Frederick Hobson
has fed the neighborhood's wild siskin finches in the backyard
garden of the apartment building where he lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have become friends with these birds,'' he says. ``These
adorable singers bring much joy to our building, garden and
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, because of one neighbor's complaint, Hobson has been
ordered to cease the feeding by the Environmental Health Management
Office of the Dept. of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bureaucracy gone mad,'' Hobson says.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where felons go free, bird-feeders feel the heat.
</P>
<P>
   WHICH ARE YOU? ``San Francisco Almanac'' says the following
snakes are found in the city: the rubber boa, racer snake, gopher
snake, garter snake and the common (!) king snake.
</P>
<P>
   IF WILLIE AND Muni are going to clean up the widespread abuse of
worker's comp, they'd better pack a lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one story: A man is injured at his Muni job, is sent to a
clinic in the Embarcadero area.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor tells the man he has a severe hernia and needs
immediate surgery. The man's own doctor later downgrades the injury
to a groin pull.
</P>
<P>
   At the clinic, though, this conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Man: ``How long will I be out of work?''
</P>
<P>
   Doctor: ``Six weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Man (dismayed): ``Six weeks?''
</P>
<P>
   Doctor: ``OK, eight weeks.''

CAMPBELL AND UNZ CONSIDER A SENATE RACE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARK SIMON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Republican Congressman Tom Campbell has been
talking with political supporters about running for the U.S. Senate
next year against incumbent Democrat Dianne Feinstein, according to
sources close to Campbell.
<P>
   Campbell, a San Francisco Bay area representative whose
tech-savvy and pro-choice background could give him a chance at
attracting the coveted ``moderate middle,'' declined to comment on
his political future Monday. But sources said he has been receiving
encouragement from Republicans alarmed that no credible challenger
would take Feinstein on next year.
</P>
<P>
   And at least a portion of Campbell's motivation for considering
the race may be an ultimatum from Stanford Law School officials
that he must return to full-time teaching or surrender his tenured
professorship. Stanford Law School Dean Kathleen Sullivan said
Monday that she and Campbell ``are involved in ongoing discussions
about how he might possibly integrate his future political and
academic careers.''
</P>
<P>
   If he decides to take on Feinstein, Campbell would enter the GOP
primary as the only moderate in a race that has attracted two other
conservatives and the possibility of a third.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide ballot initiative devotee Ron Unz, a challenger to
incumbent Gov. Pete Wilson in 1994, confirmed Monday that he is
thinking about running. San Diego County Supervisor Bill Horn has
said he will run, and Riverside state Sen. Ray Haynes formally
announced his candidacy over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But the political chatter this week here and in Washington has
focused on Campbell, whose refusal to comment, as barebones as it
might be, represents a significant shift in his public stance about
a Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several months, Campbell, who lost a Senate
Republican primary race in 1992, steadfastly has insisted that he
would run for re-election to the South Bay congressional seat he
first won in a special election in 1995, replacing retiring
incumbent Democrat Norman Mineta.
</P>
<P>
   But now, flat assertions of a run for re-election are being
replaced with statements that are more open-ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is running for re-election until he, himself, makes the
announcement that he is exploring a Senate race,'' said Kevin
Spillane, Campbell's campaign manager in the last three campaigns.
``Any announcement is off in the distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Those closest to Campbell say he has been making phone calls
over the last several days, discussing with them a possible Senate
race. Washington sources also say Campbell met personally with
Feinstein last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely thinking about it,'' said one longtime
Campbell supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is what he's told me, which is that he's thinking
about it, and he needs a few weeks to make up his mind,'' said one
Republican who is a close friend of Campbell's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to do it,'' said a political insider in the high-tech
industry. ``He's making a lot of phone calls, getting a lot of
mixed signals.''
</P>
<P>
   The mixed signals include many Republican opinion leaders who
are convinced that defeating Feinstein is nearly impossible as well
as others who are growing concerned that she will face too easy a
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A Field Poll last month showed Feinstein favored by 53 percent
of the state's voters over Horn or Haynes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she'll be very, very difficult to beat,'' said Menlo
Park venture capitalist Floyd Kvamme, (CQ)  &LR; one of the leading
Republicans in the Technology Network, the principal Silicon Valley
political action committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is very, very popular, and on a lot of the big issues,
education in particular, she's been very good,'' Kvamme said.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's popularity appears to give some pause to Unz, a
Silicon Valley executive, who spent $750,000 on Proposition 227,
last year's successful initiative banning bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   Author of a 2000 ballot measure on campaign reform, Unz said he
has been encouraged to consider the campaign by some Republican
leaders who were worried that no credible candidate would take on
Feinstein, echoing the comments made by those who say Campbell is
being urged on for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year or two ago, a lot of names were being bandied about,
but every few months, the list keeps shrinking down more and
more,'' Unz said.
</P>
<P>
   He described Feinstein as ``the 800-pound gorilla of California
politics. ... I think she certainly would be viewed as the
overwhelming incumbent.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein was elected to the Senate in a special election in
1992 and was re-elected in 1994, narrowly defeating
then-Representative Michael Huffington.
</P>
<P>
   As her re-election approaches, Feinstein has $2 million in the
bank, according to campaign manager Kam Kuwata, who said she began
actively raising money early this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been complacent. We have felt from Day 1 we would
have a race, so Campbell's flirtation comes as no surprise,''
Kuwata said. &QL;

WAC COMMISSIONER VISITS NORTH TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J. DOUGLAS FOSTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ Western Athletic Conference commissioner Karl
Benson met with North Texas athletic director Craig Helwig
yesterday and toured the UNT campus, but Helwig said Benson's visit
was merely a ``cordial conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson, whose conference is awaiting a decision concerning SMU
and TCU's potential move to Conference USA, has identified UNT as a
school that the WAC would consider for expansion should SMU and TCU
leave. North Texas is a member of the Big West Conference.
</P>
<P>
   During Benson's visit, he toured the UNT Coliseum and other
athletic facilities and also met with football coach Darrell Dickey
and Chancellor Dr. Alfred Hurley, Helwig said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good visit. I wouldn't want to characterize it in any
fashion other than that,'' Helwig said.
</P>
<P>
   Helwig wouldn't say whether he and Benson discussed specifics of
the futures of either UNT or the WAC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discussed the landscape of college athletics and the
possible future of it,'' Helwig said. ``That landscape includes a
lot of different alternatives and opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Helwig and Hurley met with Sun Belt Conference officials in
August to discuss building a football-playing conference. Either
the WAC or the Sun Belt would provide UNT a better regional base
than the Big West, officials believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long term, it would help us to achieve a set of
relationships that would make it possible for us to have more
rivalries with teams that are more familiar to our fans,'' Hurley
said. ``That should be our goal.''

TECH'S RICKY WILLIAMS HAVING TO WORK THROUGH TOUGH TIMES

<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ |Texas Tech running back Ricky Williams has
learned the reality of the old saying that life is what happens
while you're making plans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You go through hard times sometimes to get where you want to
be,'' Williams said. ``I've been through my hard times. It's over
with.MDBO/,.MDNM/ and I'm just ready to play football.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tech's star runner has had to deal with the first serious injury
of his career _ a sprained .MDBU/[ .MDNM/ACL.MDBU/]anterior
cruciate ligament in his right knee.MDNM/ suffered in the opening
game with Arizona State _ and the .MDBO/[
.MDNM/recent.MDBO/].MDNM/illness of his mother, who recently spent
four days in a hospital intensive care unit after suffering from
dehydration that stemmed from a prior .MDBO/.MDNM/stomach illness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting hurt was difficult to deal with, but I'm being
patient,'' Williams said. ``There were a lot of expectations for me
this year.MDBO/,.MDNM/ and I still have a lot of expectations for
myself. But my mother is back home.MDBO/,.MDNM/ and that's a big
burden off my shoudlers.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Williams returned to practice .MDBU/[
.MDNM/last.MDBU/].MDNM/Thursday and is hopeful of assuming his
place in the backfield when the Red Raiders (1-2) face No..MDBO/
.MDNM/5 Texas A&AMP;M (3-0) Saturday .MDBU/[ .MDNM/in.MDBU/]at.MDNM/
Jones Stadium. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know just yet whether I'll be playing Saturday
or not, but there's a good chance I will be,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Williams is wearing a brace on his right knee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain steps do hurt, but I don't have much pain,'' Williams
said. ``I'm really feeling wonderful. I'm ready to get back and
help the team.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tech coach Spike Dykes said he wants Williams back in the
lineup, but won't risk the junior's future. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky has such pain tolerance that you have to be careful with
him,'' Dykes said. ``I want him back out there, but I do not want
to do anything to jeopardize his future. If there's any doubt, he
won't play.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Sammy Morris (bruised shoulder) is probable. Right
guard Jason May (knee) and cornerback Oscar Solis (ankle sprain)
are listed .MDBU/as .MDNM/doubtful.MDBU/.[.MDNM/ early in the

\Nsubheds:Retooling Baylor &QL; 
[body]Baylor coach Kevin Steele on Monday proclaimed the Bears
(0-4) were in a ``full-blown'' retooling process. But he said that
doesn't mean immediate wholesale philosophical changes in the
offensive and defensive schemes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always looking for better ways to execute, but you
don't ever change things wholesale,'' he said. ``That's the kiss of
death. Retooling means looking at the way you're going about
recruiting _ who you're recruiting, what needs you're filling. The
way you're handling the team emotionally. The way you're
practicing. Taking care of the little things. The whole mindset has
to be retooled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But the one thing you don't ever do is give up and second
guess. A whole lot of coaches have been in this situation. The ones
who have kept focused on the bullseye are the ones who have been
successful.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bears play North Texas .MDBO/on .MDNM/Saturday. &QL; 
[body]OSU twosome doubtful &QL; 
[body]Oklahoma State linebacker Kenyatta Wright (knee) is doubtful
for Saturday's game at Nebraska.MDBO/,.MDNM/ as is quarterback Tony
Lindsay who is rehabilitating strained knee ligaments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say Tony is ahead of schedule, but I think he's
doubtful to be honest about it,'' coach Bob Simmons said. ``He
practiced a little last week, but whether or not he will play will
be based on his progress this week and what the trainers let him
do.'' &QL;

IT'S NO PASSING FANCY: COWBOYS ARE AMONG NFC'S BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Atlanta and Minnesota a combined 1-5 and with the Packers
needing miracles just to win at home, the Cowboys can make a strong
argument for being the best team in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   Though inconsistent at times, the Cowboys' offense, fortified by
the best offensive line in the league, can score points on anyone.
And despite the efforts of the Buccaneers, offense, not defense,
gets the bills paid in this league.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, a long way to go. The Cowboys have two
games with the Cardinals remaining, as well as games against Green
Bay, Minnesota, Miami and New England. The truth about the Cowboys,
who trailed by 21 at Washington and struggled to defeat a Chris
Chandler/Jamal Anderson-less Falcons team, will soon come out.
</P>
<P>
   But unless Randy Moss starts acting like Randy Moss, and unless
Steve Young and Jerry Rice start playing like it's 1994 again, the
Cowboys' chances of representing the NFC in the Super Bowl are as
good as anybody else's. Off with their heads Bruce Coslet: The
Bengals coach is 17-27 in his fourth year with the club. On Sunday,
Cincinnati outgained Carolina and held nearly a 15-minute
possession advantage, yet the Bengals still suffered a 24-point
loss to the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Hitchcock: The Vikings wide receiver knew the Packers had
time for just one more play. Yet he still sat on a short route and
let Corey Bradford run by him to haul in Brett Favre's winning pass
with 12 seconds to go in the Packers' 23-20 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Brunell: On the shadow of the Titans' goal line and needing
a field goal to tie, the Jaguars quarterback forced a pass into
double coverage, which was intercepted in Jacksonville's 20-19
upset loss to Tennessee. Running with Wolf Packers general manager
Ron Wolf should get executive-of-the-year honors just for the way
his club played against the Vikings. Last year, Randy Moss had 343
receiving yards and three touchdowns against the Packers. Last
April, Wolf selected three cornerbacks in the first three rounds of
the draft to defend Moss. On Sunday, Mike McKenzie, one of those
rookie corners, helped hold Moss to two receptions for 13 yards and
a touchdown in the Packers' 23-20 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Packers quarterback Brett Favre was near tears after the
emotional win in which he completed the game-winning touchdown with
12 seconds remaining. But Wolf was just as emotional.
</P>
<P>
   It feels good not to have to come down here and talk to you guys
\Rmedia\S about how Randy Moss beat us up,'' Wolf said. On the
defensive Offensive football is the rage in the NFL. Yet there were
some clubs Sunday who reminded of how defense was played in the
1970s. Oakland held the Bears to 34 yards rushing. Buffalo held
Philadelphia to 22 yards rushing. Tampa Bay held its third
consecutive opponent to fewer than 10 first downs in defeating
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   But a team needs to score points to win. Clubs that scored at
least 24 points on Sunday were 8-0, and are 26-6 overall. Clubs
with at least 350 yards of total offense were 6-2 and are 22-11
overall. Just noticing In Buffalo, where the Eagles were held to 22
yards rushing, Philadelphia running back Duce Staley's carries went
like this: 0, 1, 0, minus-3, 1, 2, minus-1, 3, 2, 1. The Eagles, by
the way, have been shut out four times since Opening Day 1998: by
Seattle, the Cowboys, the Giants and the Bills on Sunday, 26-0. ...
In the past two weeks, the Broncos have scored one more point than
the expansion Browns (20-19). ... The Patriots-Giants game Sunday
night was the first in which neither team committed a turnover.

Week 3 Top 5 NFL writer Kevin Lyons picks his top teams after Week
3: 1. Miami 2-0 2. Green Bay 2-1 3. New England 3-0 4. Dallas 2-0
5. Jacksonville 2-1
</P>
<P>
   Grading the NFL NFL writer Kevin Lyons gives his marks on Week 3
in the NFL. New York, New York F In successive weeks, the Jets and
Giants fell to the Washington Redskins. Throw in the struggles of
the baseball Mets, and a mosquito-borne viral disease that's going
around, and one can see it has been tough in Gotham City. Parity
B-plus Among the division leaders are Detroit (2-1), St. Louis
(2-0), Tennessee (3-0), Kansas City (2-1), Oakland (2-1), and
Seattle (2-1). None of these clubs made the playoffs in 1998. The
four clubs who made the conference finals, meanwhile _ Atlanta,
Minnesota, Denver, and the Jets _ are a combined 1-11. Eagles
travel schedule F A0fter a 26-0 loss at Buffalo, Philadelphia is
0-17-1 in its past 18 road games. The Eagles have not won on the
road since Dec. 14, 1996, when they defeated the Jets.

 &HT;    Volunteers from across N.C., U.S. pitch in for relief efforts
 &HT;    By Eunice Moscoso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ It came in the form of barbecued pork, warm
blankets and 10,000 loaves of bread. It arose from farm soil,
flowed in from other towns, resonated at churches and multiplied at
local stores.
</P>
<P>
   In the devastating ftermath of Hurricane Floyd, thousands of
hands softened the brutal impact. After federal, state and local
agencies moved in quickly to save lives, volunteers from all walks
of life also came to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   They cooked, cleaned, raised money, collected clothing, packed
up boxes, served meals, fed animals and faced countless other human
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   For Philip Tyson, 80, the fury of floodwater caused an
unforeseen and dangerous dilemma. Tyson, a resident of Williamston,
couldn't reach the Carolina Radiation Medicine Cancer Treatment
Center, for the treatment that could prolong his life.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, who has lung cancer, was one of ten patients isolated by
severely flooded roads. ``We didn't know what would happen ... what
to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Gordon Koltis found a way.
</P>
<P>
   After calling various health officials and emergency personnel,
Koltis arranged for a military helicopter to pick up the patients
and fly them from a site near Wellcome Middle School to one near
the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were grateful to be able to get our patients in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koltis assured the somewhat hesitant cancer victims _ some frail
after weeks of treatment_ that they would not be alone on the
unusual trek.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off the chopper, the doctor held an oxygen tank in one
arm and Tyson with the other. ``He helped me on the helicopter.
Helped me off ... was with me the whole time,'' Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army National Guard flew three of the flights and the U.S.
Marines charted another.
</P>
<P>
   Upon learning that Tyson had been one of the few and the proud
in World War II, the soldiers respectfully saluted the former
Marine corporal. ``It felt good, like the old days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stories of generosity and kindness overflowed throughout eastern
North Carolina _ with the same intensity and power as the water
that destroyed so many lives.
</P>
<P>
   Local businesses joined the cascade.
</P>
<P>
   Grocery stores donated thousands of gallons of water and loaves
of bread to flood victims in Greenville, Rocky Mount, Goldsboro,
Wilson and Kinston.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown merchants in the town of Farmville, population 4,300,
offered discounts on home furnishing for those donating food and
several home improvement warehouses delivered cleanup supplies,
including brooms, mops and bleach, to stores throughout the
devastated areas.
</P>
<P>
   Bookstores held canned food drives, feed stores took care of
stranded animals and radio stations raised thousands of dollars for
relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the altruism of local communities, compassion
poured in from out of town. A stream of help came from other
states, nearby cities and dozens of rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   A group of farmers from Fairfield and Engelhard in North
Carolina's Hyde County set up shop in a Greenville parking lot with
1,400 pounds of meat, 50 gallons of potatoes and 40 gallons of
string beans and served every last morsel.
</P>
<P>
   The religious community also became a source of great solace for
thousands _ and not just for the soul. Churches of all
denominations organized food drives, set up shelters, rescued
migrant workers, and collected desperately needed supplies such as
diapers and baby formula.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers at Memorial Baptist Church in Greenville served more
than 61,000 hot meals last week in conjunction with the American
Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Retired middle school teacher Natalie Brackenhoff was there
every day _ working diligently, helping as many as possible. Her
heart stopped for a moment, however, when a familiar face appeared
in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It was a former student and her family of seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lost everything,'' she said. ``That's the first time it
really hit me.''

 &HT;    Chance of a lifetime will have to wait
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI, Fla. _ There's a pair of khaki shorts drooping from the
closet doorknob in my friend Jeanne's guestroom, its cargo-style
pockets filled with a hand-held tape recorder, a passport, twenty
bucks, and a clean handkerchief.
</P>
<P>
   Draped over a nearby stack of baskets is a well-worn white
shirt, its pockets stuffed with mechanical pencils, notepads,
sunglasses, and a day's dose of Dramamine. The clothes and I were
scheduled for a dawn departure aboard a friend's DC-3 bound for
Marsh Harbour in the Abaco islands, carrying much needed supplies
to that area of the Bahamas hard hit by Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   By late yesterday afternoon the venerable WW2 cargo plane waited
patiently on the ramp of a local airport, her airworthiness
certificate proudly displayed in the cockpit. Cargo doors were
flung wide, and a few windows propped open in an almost futile
attempt to beat the oppressive south Florida heat.
</P>
<P>
   Pickups brimming with donations from stores and churches backed
to her side and began offloading their life-sustaining cargo _
cases of bottled water and crates of food. Bags of disposable
diapers, clothing, and linens were shoved behind the ten generators
that had been loaded earlier, bound for Man of War Cay.
</P>
<P>
   Our truckload was filled with supplies Jeanne had cadged from a
local supermarket. The rest were bags of linens from her own
closets. She'd weighed each crate by stepping onto the bathroom
scales with it and subtracting her weight. Seven hundred pounds
she'd tallied. I watched as the pilot added this latest load to the
weights he was calculating on the side of an oatmeal box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much,'' he said shaking his head. ``We've got to drop a
couple of thousand pounds. How much do you weigh?'' He was talking
to me. I fumbled and fudged a bit knowing that an undeclared 10
pounds wasn't going to keep our tail wheel glued to the tarmac. I
wanted to mention that I'd just joined a gym and today's estimate
would soon be a reality. I didn't. A long time ago I learned that
girls aren't supposed to say dumb things to guys who lean against
airplane wings and discuss weights and balance.
</P>
<P>
   The adventure I was preparing for was a life-long dream come
true. It was the payoff for all of those '40s movies I'd sat
through _ the ones where Alan Ladd and William Bendix risked their
lives flying DC-3s into Saigon and Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
   It had begun when Jeanne's husband, a retired airline pilot,
regaled us over dinner Saturday evening with the story of a buddy
of his who owns a DC-3 and had been flying supplies to the islands.
He'd flown co-pilot with him that very morning, delivering a
planeload of generators, diapers, baby food, and other things folks
in the Abacos had been doing without since Floyd hit.
</P>
<P>
   He laughed as he described his takeoff roll _ a side to side
waggle down the runway in an attempt to see around the nose. And
how on landing he had, through force of habit, tried to plant a
non-existent nosewheel onto the runway only to be reminded by the
pilot that the third wheel was on the tail and he might ought to be
thinking of a way to get it on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Then he asked me if I wanted to go along on Tuesday's run. The
offer was no more out of his mouth than I had the first line of my
story written: ``Tuesday morning, about sun-up. I'm strapped into
the back end of an airplane almost as old as I am bound for....''
</P>
<P>
   That was Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night Tropical Storm Harvey blew across south Florida
from the Gulf of Mexico and aimed for the Abacos. It was packing
sustained winds of 50 miles an hour and gusting. The mission was
scrubbed and rescheduled for the next day, but I had an airline
ticket out. Time to head north.
</P>
<P>
   We took off about the same time on Wednesday morning _ my
friends and I. Trouble is, I was strapped into the wrong airplane.

 &HT;    He'd leave education up to marketplace and the Lord
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When I hear Marshall Fritz talk about public
schools, I remember an old Cold War T-shirt slogan: ``Kill 'em all.
Let God sort 'em out.''
</P>
<P>
   Fritz believes public schools to be the Great Satan, or at least
Satan's conduit. As such, he wants them abolished. He's formed the
Separation of School and State Alliance and speaks widely.
Everywhere he goes, he asks people to sign a yellow card pledging
support for these words: ``We must end government involvement in
education funding, attendance and content.''
</P>
<P>
   He passed out his cards to an evening audience at Baylor
University last week. One didn't see a lot of obeisant scribbling
of signatures, in part because two Baylor professors provided a
spirited counterpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz blasts public education as raw socialism ``that destroys
both morality and education.''
</P>
<P>
   One quick impression of Fritz is that his spiel emanates more
from a quest for true government-established religion than a
government-butt-out libertarianism. He seems to pine for the good
old days of buckled shoes and witch trials.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court standing in the way of said backward leap,
Fritz and his organization call for a great exodus. The alliance
lists at least two Republican congressmen, Texas' Ron Paul and
Colorado's Tom Tancredo, as supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz and his organization are opposed to any public money at
all going to education _ including school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   What the alliance wants is a nothing less than a government
pull-out, with the resulting savings going back to the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz says that the abolition of public schools would result in
a $300 billion tax cut spread across the land, and with the
resulting savings in property taxes, families far and wide could
afford to place their children in a private school of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   That's possibly true, except when it comes to the poorest
Americans _ those who own no property and would have no discernible
savings to reap from this tax windfall. Fritz acknowledges that the
families of some 15 million children would be left without such
options.
</P>
<P>
   For those families, said Fritz, scholarships would bloom like
cactus flowers. ``All'' it would take, he said, is $15 billion to
$30 billion in private scholarship money.
</P>
<P>
   That's ``all,'' folks.
</P>
<P>
   To the assertion that his answer to dreaded socialism is social
Darwinism, with the resulting loss of quality education
opportunities for millions, Fritz responds, ``Utopia isn't one of
our choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Utopia, as I read it, is a quality education for every child. It
must be a satanic quest for government to attempt that.
</P>
<P>
   In rebutting Fritz, Mark Bateman, associate dean of the Baylor
School of Education, didn't get around fully to pointing out the
extent to which public schools have become a whipping boy for all
of society's problems, but he did point out to the audience the
danger to society of everyone retreating into their corners of
race, religion and social insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Bateman wondered aloud to what extent Fritz pines for a return
to spiritual morality at the cost of a new segregation and social
separatism.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Davis of the Baylor Institute of Church-State Studies
called public schools the ``staple of our democracy,'' with the
``vast majority fit as a fiddle.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wondered, if public schools are to blame for moral rot,
why ``every poll shows that 94 percent to 95 percent of Americans
believe in God.''
</P>
<P>
   Fritz believes that ``godless schools'' are the worst possible
environment. Any alternative is a better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave them home to watch 'Laverne and Shirley' reruns. They're
safer,'' he urges.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow cards, anyone?

<P>
   OFF THE GEORGIA COAST _ Brunswick business executive Dave Parks
sat on the rail of the 25-foot boat, anchored at the edge of St.
Andrews Sound, hacking up bait fish and throwing the bloody chunks
overboard.
</P>
<P>
   As Parks worked to attract sharks with the chum slick, charter
boat captain Mark Noble and his other customer, developer Frank
Deloach III, both of St. Simons Island, baited lines and cast them
into the olive swells.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sparkling late-summer day on a wild stretch of coast. A
bald eagle perched on silvered driftwood against an endless green
backdrop of salt marsh. Big tarpon rolled near the boat. Pods of
dolphin cruised past.
</P>
<P>
   St. Andrews Sound, between Jekyll Island and Little Cumberland
Island, is home to some of the Eastern Seaboard's biggest sharks:
huge hammerheads, tigers, bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Noble, 38, who holds two state shark fishing records, knows how
to boat the big ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll catch sharks today,'' he promised.
</P>
<P>
   It was a scene reminiscent of ``Jaws,'' the mid-1970s hit film
about a giant, man-eating great white shark. But if Quinn were
angling for Jaws in Georgia today, he'd probably be attacked _ not
by the monster shark but by sport fishermen trying to save the
creature's life.
</P>
<P>
   Coastal shark populations have declined so drastically in recent
years that recreational fishermen are practicing strict shark
conservation measures unheard of only a few decades ago. Although
new state and federal laws have given sharks more protection, many
recreational fishermen, conservationists and scientists are calling
for even stricter controls.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic shark populations, including large species that cruise
the Georgia coast, are down about 75 percent compared to just 25
years ago, said Dr. Bob Hueter, director of the Center for Shark
Research at the Mote Marine Laboratory in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large coastal shark species are all severely overfished,''
Hueter said. ``For some species, it's even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Noble's customers catch thousands of sharks each year but return
almost all to the sea unharmed, he said. ``Last year, we kept
probably six or eight blacktips to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   When Deloach reeled in a small bonnethead, Noble called
attention to the shark's swollen belly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a mature female, full of pups,'' he said, unhooking
the shark and letting it swim away. ``We don't want to take these
fish under any circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Noble admits his own attitude about shark fishing has changed
radically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, people caught trophy sharks to mount the
jaws. I did it myself,'' he said. ``Some people still like to catch
big sharks, but I won't offer charters for that at all any more.
Now, we try to do what's best for the fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Greg Smith, 39, who operates Ducky II Charter Boat
Services Inc. on St. Simons Island, said he refuses charters from
customers who want to keep the sharks they catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``My three boats haven't kept any sharks, big or small, for the
past four years,'' Smith said. ``Sharks have got enough problems
without me and my kind killing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say recreational fishing, which spiked in popularity
after ``Jaws,'' contributed to local declines in certain shark
species. But the boom in commercial shark fishing that began during
the mid-1980s is to blame for the overall population drop, most
agree.
</P>
<P>
   During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the National Marine
Fisheries Service encouraged commercial shark fishing, said Rebecca
Lent, who heads the agency's Highly Migratory Species Management
Division in Silver Springs, Md. Lent's division manages fisheries
along the Atlantic seaboard, in the Gulf of Mexico, and in the
Caribbean, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, shark was an underutilized species,'' Lent said.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial boats quickly moved into United States territorial
waters, landing millions of tons of sharks every year. Asian
customers began demanding shark fins, popular in soups, increasing
pressure on the emerging fishery. Worldwide consumption of shark
meat soared.
</P>
<P>
   In just a few years, overharvesting had left several Atlantic
shark species threatened or in danger of regional extinction,
according to the California-based Pelagic Shark Research
Foundation, a nonprofit organization that promotes shark
conservation and education worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   While sharks as a species have survived for millions of years,
they mature and reproduce slowly, making them especially vulnerable
to modern fishing methods, such as long lines and drift gill nets,
foundation researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   The Fisheries Service enacted laws in 1993 banning shark fin
fishing _ removing the fin and throwing back the carcass _ and
regulating other recreational and commercial catches, Lent said.
States, including Georgia, followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   When Atlantic shark populations failed to rebound, the service
cut commercial quotas in half in 1997 and curtailed them even more
in 1998, according to Lent.
</P>
<P>
   But a final plan to regulate commercial shark fishing, scheduled
to take effect this July, was overturned in a court suit, she said,
allowing commercial boats to return to more liberal 1997 limits. At
the same time, stricter recreational shark fishing laws did go into
effect. In most cases, they limit fishermen in federal waters to
one shark per boat per trip; state law allows two sharks per day.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the 1999 regulations for commercial boats were wiped
out by that judge in Florida,'' she said. ``It's sad that they only
apply now to recreational fishermen.''
</P>
<P>
   Charter captains like Noble and Smith say it makes no sense to
clamp down on recreational fishermen while allowing commercial
boats to continue catching sharks by the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   They are especially critical of commercial drift gill netters
from other states who fish off the Georgia coast. Lent said only
about a dozen such boats operate between North Carolina and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Drift gill nets, horizontal lengths of mesh that float just
below the surface, are designed to entangle fish. Although laws
require commercial fishermen to release protected species, experts
claim most sharks die before they can be released.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he sympathizes with commercial fishermen who could
lose their livelihood if drift gill nets are banned. But he claims
they should be. ``They're an absolute horror,'' Smith said.
``They're as bad as condominiums on the beach.''

 &HT;    In New Mexico, a day to honor one's lost loved ones
 &HT;    By Sally D. Swartz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESILLA, N.M. _ Day of the Dead, my sister said, is a New Mexico
cultural experience I must not miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``People build little altars for dead relatives and friends with
their loved ones' favorite foods and other special things. They
dress up as skeletons and eat bread shaped like skulls.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought it sounded weird. My sister, Derrickson Moore, a
writer for the Las Cruces Sun News, got the arty, oddball genes in
our family. ``It's interesting and it's different. It's touching.
You'll like it,'' she said. ``I'm making an altar to remember Mom.
Come out and help me celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   So I arrived the last week in October 1998, when the annual Dia
de los Muertos activities were revving up. In Mesilla, a quaint
restored adobe village on the outskirts of Las Cruces, art exhibits
and altar-making workshops go on all month, with the big
celebrations Oct. 31 and Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   My sister had made an altar honoring ``Las Mujeres
Maravillosas,'' the Wonderful Women: Artist Georgia O'Keeffe,
Oregon psychic Tenny Hale and our mom, Doris Van Vleck Derrickson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring some pictures of Mom,'' my sister said, ``and anyone
else you'd like to remember.''
</P>
<P>
   I added a favorite photo of my old dog, Satchmo, to the display,
which we set up at the plaza in the morning. We included marigolds,
the favorite Dia de los Muertos flower, and a mallard duck, symbol
of mom's love of the great outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   We put out a loaf of skull bread, complete with black olive
eyes, green pepper eyebrows and a red chile smile. Very tasty. We
saved another loaf to eat.
</P>
<P>
   My sister loaned me her black T-shirt with a smiling skeleton in
dangly earrings. Then we strolled around the plaza, meeting the
people and getting to know their dead relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Silva used a trash bin lid, marked Silva Sanitation, to
show photos and symbols of his father's life with the family
garbage collection business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's my dad when he was young, and here he is drinking
tequila with some cousins.'' Silva said. ``This little truck loaded
with cotton is for my grandfather's cotton farms.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffin-builder Lloyd Gibson displayed pine boxes, showing how
you can buy now and use your coffin as a couch, a coffee table or a
wardrobe until later. The prices were reasonable _ just $450 for
the Boothill Box, which included an epitaph: ``Think of this/As you
pass by:/That as you are/So once was I./And as I am/Someday you'll
be./Think on this./Remember me.''
</P>
<P>
   Store windows displayed cheerful skeletons in cute outfits.
Frank Sinatra got a big display at one shop, complete with a fifth
of Jack Daniels and a pack of smokes.
</P>
<P>
   Carolene de Mesilla remembered her late husband in the front
window of her Southwestern designer dress shop. ``It's funny,'' she
said. ``You fall in love all over again when you realize what you
had and what you lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives of Mesillero Ramon, a popular violinist,
had prepared a full meal of his favorite food and arranged the
tortillas, rice and refried beans on a TV tray, along with a bottle
of Metamucil.
</P>
<P>
   At dusk, fiesta-goers were called to attention by Gigante, a
model of an 8-foot-tall cowboy covered by a flowered cloth with
framework for a man to stand inside. Gigante led a candlelight
parade through the streets of Old Mesilla to the town cemetery.
There we all paused for a moment to remember our loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   A memory of Mom when she visited me in Connecticut 30 years ago
came to me. I lived in a beach house in Milford, and my daughter
Brandy was a year old. Mom and I took my dog Satchmo down to the
beach one day for a walk.
</P>
<P>
   We watched his running, dancing, prancing pursuit of the
seagulls soaring over Long Island Sound. ``He's the most beautiful
picture of utter freedom I've ever seen,'' Mom said.
</P>
<P>
   We found a bouquet of flowers beside Mom's pictures when we went
to pack up our altar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow,'' my sister said, ``Dia de los Muertos takes the
sting out of death and makes it more what it is: A part of life.''
</P>

 &HT;    Drug can prevent stroke-related disability for patients who seek
care quickly
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Without TPA, Michael Miller is sure his legs
wouldn't have been almost fully working three weeks after his Aug.
26 stroke. Libby Ahern doubts if she would be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) has been minimizing stroke
damage by dissolving blood clots since 1996, but it's still not
widely known that people can spare themselves a lifetime disability
by hustling to the hospital when stroke symptoms first appear.
People receiving TPA within three hours of the onset of the most
common type of stroke are 30 percent more likely to have little or
no impairment a year later, the New England Journal of Medicine
reported in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal study didn't look at TPA's immediate impact, but Dr.
Kenneth Pugar has seen it a few times. ``We see a number of people
just literally get better in hours after we give the drug,'' says
the Kettering Medical Center neurologist. ``And we've had a couple
of very dramatic ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahern was one of them. ``It really works,'' says the 75-year-old
Kettering woman, whose sister died of a stroke before TPA was
available.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern was in a Meijer checkout lane just after midnight of
Christmas Eve morning in 1997. She was lining her groceries up on
the counter and suddenly her hand froze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill looked at me and said, `What's the matter?' `` Ahern says
of her husband. She tried to answer but couldn't talk. She
remembers someone calling 911 and someone else moving her groceries
to another lane. But after being carried into the ambulance,
everything else from the next 24 hours is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad said it was like somebody sort of popped her with a pin
in the checkout lane,'' says Ahern's daughter, Val Alvey. ``She
just kind of melted.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvey heard from her brother a little after 12:30 a.m., but he
was crying so hard, she couldn't understand a word. ``I thought it
was a prank,'' she says. ``So I hung up.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Alvey reached the hospital at 1:15, her mother was
``totally out of it. She couldn't talk, couldn't move, nothing.''
Ahern's right side was rigid and turned inward, and the only
movement of her left side appeared to be involuntary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her right side was totally paralyzed and she couldn't see
anything off to the right,'' Pugar says. ``This was a major, major
stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't any question about Ahern's stroke symptoms, but
sometimes they're easier to ignore. Miller, for example, felt his
feet going numb as he walked into his Versailles home. ``I poured a
cup of coffee and carried it into the other room OK, but then I
went to drink it and it spilled into my lap,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Any sudden numbness, tingling, slurring or loss of speech, or
loss of muscular control on one side of the body is a likely
indicator of a stroke, says the American Stroke Association, a
division of the American Heart Association. Strokes are caused by
either blood clots or hemorrhages that keep blood away from part of
the brain. Deprived of oxygen and other nutrients in the blood, the
brain cells begin dying.
</P>
<P>
   TPA, used for more than 10 years to dissolve cardiac blood
clots, works only for the 85 percent of strokes that are ischemic,
or caused by blood clots. Another group of patients can't use it
because of their other medical conditions or medications. So the
three-hour window when TPA is useful must include enough time for
the examination and CAT scan to make sure TPA won't do more harm
than good.
</P>
<P>
   After Ahern qualified, Pugar told her children it was an option.
He said it could dissolve the blood clot and help her, it could be
ineffective or it could ``dissolve everything and she would bleed
to death,'' Alvey says. Her mother had a good chance of dying even
without the treatment, and status quo survival didn't look very
appealing as she lay motionless and mute.
</P>
<P>
   Following protocol, Pugar gave Ahern 10 percent of the liqng
around the room and trying to focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahern wouldn't be out of danger for 24 hours, doctors said, but
she kept improving. Her speech was slurred, but she was talking.
She was 70 percent or 80 percent improved by the next day, Pugar
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Pugar looked at her on Christmas morning and said, `I want
you to know this is the best Christmas present I ever had,' ``
Alvey says. Ahern was alert enough by then to remember the visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what he was talking about,'' she says. ``I
didn't realize he had saved my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The 730,000 strokes a year in this country are its leading cause
of disability and third-ranked cause of death. The annual rate of
31.9 stroke deaths per 100,000 people in Montgomery County, Ohio,
is 23 percent higher than the national rate, says the Miami Valley
American Heart Association. And about one-third of strokes strike
people younger than 65 such as Miller, a 50-year-old plumber.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's entire left side was numb, but he never lost
consciousness or the ability to speak. Dr. Lawrence Goldstick gave
him the lowdown on TPA risks directly, he says. ``I told him, `You
do whatever you think is best.' What could I say, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   At his worst, Miller lost movement of his left leg and arm and
some of his right leg. Within three weeks, movement in his right
leg had fully returned. He could control and stand on his left leg
and walk with a cane. He could lift his recently limp left arm to
his side and pull it back to his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very encouraging from where I was,'' he says. ``I'm
pretty confident of getting it all back.''
</P>
<P>
   Pugar can't say for sure that TPA stops any particular stroke in
its tracks. ``There are some who have rapid improvement without any
treatment,'' he concedes. But his gut tells him TPA made the
difference in Libby Ahern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful,'' says Ahern, who's back to doing the
cooking and housework and pretty much everything she used to do.
``It's too bad more people don't get there in time to get help.''

such, he wants them abolished. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

65. Recent research, however, strongly suggests that many of the

skeletons and eat bread shaped like skulls.'' I thought it sounded
weird. My sister got the arty, oddball genes in our family. ``It's
interesting and it's different. It's touching. You'll like it,''
she said. ``I'm making an altar to remember Mom. Come out and help

 &HT;    It's time to get real about retirement
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot of us expect, or at least hope, that we can retire before
we reach age 65.
</P>
<P>
   Recent research, however, strongly suggests that many of the
hopefuls are talking through their hats. They haven't invested very
much, nor have they tried to estimate what income they will have or
will need. Many know little about their pensions, if they have
them. A large percentage think they will be eligible for full
Social Security benefits long before they actually will.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean that the unprepared will serve a life
sentence in the salt mines. It does mean they are in for some
brain-shaker surprises if they don't start working on the problem
before they get much older.
</P>
<P>
   The chart (EDS: BELOW) shows just how important personal savings
are to elderly Americans right now _ on average, 21 percent of
their spending nd grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   But it appears certain that future retirees will be prosperous
only if they start birthing a very large nest egg.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas G. Hesse, a certified financial planner in Roswell, has
been designing retirement plans for more than 20 years. Here are
the high points of his suggestions on the moves workers need to
make now:
</P>
<P>
   _ Find out whether your aspirations are for real.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to write down your current circumstances and your
investment plans, estimate how much growth you can expect and
calculate how long that money will last if you retire at a given
age.
</P>
<P>
   ``My clients say this is the most valuable thing I've given
them,'' Hesse said. ``They know they could retire, or that they
couldn't retire as things now stand.'' Sometimes the conclusion is
that the client can retire but not any time soon. Other
alternatives might be to save more or invest more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   You can get a rough idea for free, using calculators supplied on
the Internet by mutual fund families. You can find a good one at
www.troweprice.com. Commercial software packages, like Microsoft
Money 2000, have more sophisticated versions that can be expected
to give a more reliable estimate.
</P>
<P>
   You can also hire a financial adviser to guide you through the
process. The price for this one-shot consultation could be about
$500, though some certified financial planners would do it for
less. Hesse recommends the expert, whom you would expect to be more
realistic about things like your investment prowess and your
post-retirement spending plans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check out the traditional resources.
</P>
<P>
   Your company's human resources department can give you an
estimate of how much your pension will be. ``You would be amazed
how few people know,'' Hesse said. ``Once you find out, it gives
you peace of mind. You quit fooling yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a good idea to get a projection of your Social
Security benefits. The Social Security Administration will soon
start sending out annual reports to all eligible workers. If you
want one, call 1-800-772-1213.
</P>
<P>
   _ Put the maximum into tax-deferred retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   For most workers, that means individual retirement accounts and
401(k) plans. Other plans are available for the self-employed and
workers at small companies.
</P>
<P>
   These plans postpone income tax bills on the money you make from
your investments until you retire and take the money out. Often you
can deduct your contribution from the year's taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure your investments are diversified.
</P>
<P>
   If you intend to keep portions of your investments in bonds or
money markets, glorious gains in the stock market may have skewed
your allocations.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Hesse said, workers should beware of having too
much of their holdings in the stock of the company they work for.
That can happen if your employer matches 401(k) contributions with
company stock.
</P>
<P>
   Hesse has other suggestions, and most workers could think up
some for themselves. Whatever actions you to take, the point is to
get started now if you want to get happy later.
</P>
<P>
   SAVINGS IS IMPORTANT
</P>
<P>
   Elderly Americans report that investment income provides one
dollar in five of their income _ second only to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security 40.9%
</P>
<P>
   Savings 21.0%
</P>
<P>
   Pensions 18.7%
</P>
<P>
   Earnings 16.6%
</P>
<P>
   Other 2.8%
</P>
<P>
   Note: Data include persons over 65, some of whom are still
working.

are to elderly Americans right now _ on average, 21 percent of
their spending money comes from the assets they built for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That percentage will grow in the future. One reason is that
employers are beginning to cut back or eliminate pension plans,
even as they set up 401(k) plans that are their employees'
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is that Social Security benefits will certainly
get more skimpy in the future. I do not believe Social Security
will disappear, no matter how much yammering I hear from Washington
or from the sellers of financial products.
</P>
<P>
   Too many Americans already have a stake in the system, and too
many of us have already seen how important the program is to our
parents and grandparents.

 &HT;    NUTS &AMP; BOLTS: Experienced do-it-yourselfers can replace medicine
cabinets
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ I don't have a medicine cabinet anymore, and I
don't miss it much.
</P>
<P>
   The house I moved into in May has a large mirror, mounted
directly to the wall above the bathroom sink, and a drawer under a
countertop where we keep razor blades, dental floss and daily
hair-care stuff. The medicines we use regularly, such as aspirin
and antacid, have moved to a shelf over the kitchen sink.
</P>
<P>
   The trend through the 1970s and '80s was bigger and bigger
medicine chests with coordinated light bars. Big medicine cabinets
were matched with nice vanities under the bathroom sink in most new
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Now dainty pedestal sinks are the rage, and they look better
with smaller medicine cabinets or wall-mounted mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever style you prefer, replacing a medicine cabinet is a
job an experienced do-it-yourselfer can handle.
</P>
<P>
   Medicine cabinets come in two styles: those that are attached
directly to the surface of the wall and those that are recessed
with a portion of the cabinet pushed behind the surface of the wall
between wall studs.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing a recessed cabinet with another recessed cabinet of
the same size should be fairly easy, but we all know the words
``should be fairly easy'' are the kiss of death for any home
project.
</P>
<P>
   Remove any movable shelves and look for screws through the side
walls or back of the cabinet. If the cabinet has a built-in light
fixture, cut the power to the circuit from the breaker panel or
fuse box.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the screws holding the cabinet in place and carefully
disconnect any electrical wires. Slide the old cabinet out.
</P>
<P>
   Put the new cabinet in place and see if it fits snugly in the
opening left by the old cabinet. If the opening is a little too
large, you can usually get it to fit by adding wood shims. Masking
tape can hold the shims in place while you experiment with
different shim positions until you get a good fit.
</P>
<P>
   Connect the wires to the light on your new cabinet, if it has a
light, and use screws through the side or back to hold it in place.
</P>
<P>
   You can replace a small recessed cabinet with a larger one if
your bathroom has wallboard (assuming you know how to work with
wallboard). Widening a hole in a plaster wall is probably a job for
a professional.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the old cabinet and determine where the new cabinet will
be positioned. Find the studs behind the wall on either side of
where you want the cabinet and mark a line on the wall over the
center of both studs. Draw another line horizontally a few inches
below the bottom of where you want the cabinet to go.
</P>
<P>
   Use a circular saw with the blade depth set to match the
thickness of the wallboard. Cut along the horizontal line and along
the vertical lines from the bottom cut to the ceiling. Remove the
old wallboard.
</P>
<P>
   Using a reciprocating saw, remove sections of the wall studs
that are in the way of the new cabinet. The removed sections should
be about 3 1/2 inches longer than the height of the medicine
cabinet; cuts should line up with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Cut two lengths of stud lumber to fit between the studs on
either side of the medicine cabinet. Nail one length of lumber on
top of the studs you cut behind the wall; this will be the sill
plate on which your cabinet will rest. Nail the other board to the
bottom of the cut studs; this is your header plate.
</P>
<P>
   Cut two more lengths of stud lumber to fit between the header
plate and sill plate. Nail these into position to support the sides
of your new cabinet. These are called jack studs.
</P>
<P>
   Install a new piece of wallboard with a hole matching the hole
needed for the cabinet. Slide the cabinet in and fasten it with
screws to the jack studs.
</P>
<P>
   It's usually easier to install a medicine cabinet to the wall
surface instead of recessed. But a surface-mounted cabinet extends
further from the wall and has a bulkier look.
</P>
<P>
   Home-improvement stores tend to feature surface-mounted cabinets
because they are an easier product for do-it-yourselfers to handle.
Cabinets range from $20 for a simple metal and plastic affair to
$600 for a massive hardwood cabinet with matching light bar.
</P>
<P>
   To remove an existing surface-mounted cabinet, simply remove the
screws through the back of the cabinet and disconnect the
electrical wires.
</P>
<P>
   Locate the studs and draw lines on the wall down the centers of
the studs where the new cabinet will go.
</P>
<P>
   Most surface-mounted cabinets have a thicker area near the top
of their back wall; this is the hanger strip that will support most
of the weight of the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   With an assistant holding the new cabinet in place, drill guide
holes through the hanger strip into the studs behind the wall. If
screws aren't included with the cabinet, the instructions should
tell you what size screws are needed to hold it securely.
</P>
<P>
   Drive screws through the hanger strip to hold the cabinet in
place. Additional screws through the back of the cabinet lower
along the studs will help hold the cabinet steady.
</P>
<P>
   Mirrors are installed in similar fashion. The back of the mirror
should have a bracket designed to be fastened to studs behind the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Find and mark the studs; attach the brackets; hang the mirror
from the brackets.

Constitution). 9.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ President Bill Clinton has dropped out as next
year's Jefferson Lecturer on the Humanities, selected by the
National Endowment for the Humanities. Academia went quite bananas
at the prospect of Clinton taking a lectern occupied in the past by
historian Barbara Tuchman, poet Gwendolyn Brooks, novelist Robert
Penn Warren and other intellectual swanks. (Teepen, Cox
Newspapers.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Soliciting for tips has become a cottage
industry and, to me, ranks high in the bad taste bracket.
(Kleinberg, Cox News Service). MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ MIAMI, Fla. _ The adventure I was preparing for
was a life-long dream come true. It was the payoff for all of those
'40s movies I'd sat through. I was scheduled for a dawn departure
aboard a friend's DC-3 bound for Marsh Harbour in the Abaco
islands, carrying much needed supplies to that area of the Bahamas
hard hit by Hurricane Floyd. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ When I hear Marshall Fritz talk
about public schools, I remember an old Cold War T-shirt slogan:
``Kill 'em all. Let God sort 'em out.'' Fritz believes public
schools to be the Great Satan, or at least Satan's conduit. As
such, he wants them abolished. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

   THE MECHANIC _ In the good old days, customizing a car for

with the emergence of computerized engines and transaxles used in
front-wheel-drive vehicles. (Carter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

<P>
   MONEYTALK _ A lot of us expect, or at least hope, that we can
retire before we reach age 65. Recent research, however, strongly
suggests that many of the hopefuls are talking through their hats.
They haven't invested very much, nor have they tried to estimate
what income they will have or will need. Many know little about
their pensions, if they have them. A large percentage think they
will be eligible for full Social Security benefits long before they
actually will. That does not mean that the unprepared will serve a
life sentence in the salt mines. It does mean they are in for some
brain-shaker surprises if they don't start working on the problem
before they get much older.Personal finance advice. (Ezell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

<P>
   LIFESTYLE
</P>
<P>
   NEWMEXICO-DEADDAY _ MESILLA, N.M. _ Day of the Dead, my sister
said, is a New Mexico cultural experience I must not miss. ``People
build little altars for dead relatives and friends with their loved
ones' favorite foods and other special things. They dress up as
skeletons and eat bread shaped like skulls.'' I thought it sounded
weird. My sister got the arty, oddball genes in our family. ``It's
interesting and it's different. It's touching. You'll like it,''
she said. ``I'm making an altar to remember Mom. Come out and help
me celebrate.'' So I arrived the last week in October 1998, when
the annual Dia de los Muertos activities were revving up. (Swartz,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   STROKE-MEDICATION _ Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) has been
minimizing stroke damage by dissolving blood clots since 1996, but
it's still not widely known that people can spare themselves a
lifetime disability by hustling to the hospital when stroke
symptoms first appear. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   FASHION
</P>
<P>
   FASHION-MILAN _ MILAN _ A. Scott Walton reports from Fashion
Week in Milan. Combo of main runway revue, notes and occasional
postcards. (Walton, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT-ARTS
</P>
<P>
   TV-RATINGS _ Brief review/analysis of first week of network

``Once and Again,'' ``Freaks and Geeks,'' ``Special Victims Unit,''
``Third Watch,'' ``The West Wing'', etc. (Kloer, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

   HOME AND GARDEN
</P>
<P>
   GARDENING-LIFE _ A gardening column by Lee May. (May, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

<P>
   HOME-PICTURES _ If there's one rule when it comes to framing and
displaying art in the home, it's this: There are none. Pictures
should be framed and displayed to their best advantage while at the
same time complementing a home's decor. ``For every rule, there's
an un-rule,'' says the framer for Elton John, who by the way, will
display 200 of his 2,000 photos next year at the High Museum in
Atlanta. (Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)

READ A BANNED BOOK, GIVE ONE TO YOUR CHILD TO READ 
</HEADLINE>

Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

<TEXT>
<P>
   A home without a library lacks diversity of voices, opinions and
world views. When you read a book, you enter another person's
perspective. And because a reader can put the book down and think
about what the author has said, a good reader enters a dialogue
with the author or the characters created by the author. One can
reread passages and linger over thoughts or ideas or savor the
deliciousness of the language.
</P>
<P>
   Television, even at its best, lacks diversity; lacks the ability
for a viewer to carry on an inner dialogue with the speakers or the
author of the program. Books encourage thinking. A reader must
create images from the words the author has supplied, must imagine
the events described, must track the plot or the logic of the
writer and must visualize the main characters in the mind's eye.
</P>
<P>
   The book is in your hands. You can return to passages if there
is something you don't understand. You can argue with the author in
your head; you can nod in agreement. You learn, unconsciously, the
way words can fit together _ sometimes so well that they seem
inevitable and irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   The book is in your hands and so, too, is the right to read.
There are many in our nation who would restrict this right.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 1,001 adults conducted in March for the First
Amendment Center in Nashville, Tenn., indicates that the free
speech and free press rights guaranteed by the Constitution are in
jeopardy. More than half of the survey respondents believe the
press has too much freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The press includes book publishers as well as newspapers. And
nearly one-third believe the First Amendment goes too far in the
rights it guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   The American Library Association set aside the week of Sept. 25
to Oct. 2 as Banned Book Week to remind us how precious this right
to read and the right to express our thoughts are to our society.
</P>
<P>
   Reading stimulates the mind to grow, to comprehend, to adapt, to
change attitudes, to question. Studies have shown copycat behavior
that can be blamed upon a book is rare, indeed, and can only come
from the most brutish level of reading. To read, the mind must be
active _ it translates words into emotions, into doubts, into a
walk alongside the author as a friendly companion who has his or
her own thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   My brother, sister and I grew up surrounded by my father's
library. My father was a military man with over 30-years service.
He was politically conservative, but socially progressive; and read
eclectically, favoring historical fiction as well as thoughtful
novels and actual histories.
</P>
<P>
   When I, as a young boy, asked him if I could read one of the
books in his library, his advice to me was: ``If you think you can
understand it or want to, then it's yours to read.'' That was good
advice then. It is now.
</P>
<P>
   The first book I read from my father's library was Erskine
Caldwell's ``God's Little Acre,'' and then Caldwell's ``Tobacco
Road.'' Both had been banned somewhere in the United States during
those years. John Steinbeck's ``Of Mice and Men'' graced my
father's library shelves. I read it, too, while I was still in
junior high. ``Of Mice and Men'' continues to be one of the most
challenged and banned books in America _ and considered one of the
most beloved books by those who have actually read it.
</P>
<P>
   Only years later did I realize that a significant number of
those books my father allowed me to read before I had graduated
from high school had been banned in various states and educational
institutions: Thomas Wolfe's ``Of Time and the River,'' Aldous
Huxley's ``Brave New World,'' George Orwell's ``1984,'' Bram
Stoker's ``Dracula,'' Sinclair Lewis' ``Elmer Gantry,'' Mark
Twain's ``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'' and ``The Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn,'' Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's ``The Adventures of
Sherlock Holmes,'' Ernest Hemingway's ``A Farewell to Arms'' and
``The Sun Also Rises,'' Walter Van Tilburg Clark's ``The Ox-Bow
Incident,'' Charles Dicken's ``Oliver Twist'' and Theodore
Dreiser's ``An American Tragedy.'' I tried to read all of Edward
Gibbon's ``The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire,`` but it was too tough for me at that stage of my life.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to think that any one educated in the United
States has not read most of these books and grown with the
readings.
</P>
<P>
   I read my first William Faulkner novel from my father's library,
``A Fable,'' and it began a lifelong love affair with Faulkner's
novels and his writing style _ more importantly, for me, it began
my own love affair with language. ``A Fable,'' an allegorical novel
about World War I, won the Pulitzer Prize. It wasn't banned, but
two of Faulkner's greatest works were _ ``As I Lay Dying'' and
``The Wild Palms.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the publisher Modern Library released a list it
entitled the ``100 Best Novels of the 20th Century.'' Nearly
one-third of those novels were banned at one time or another. Six
of the top 10 on the Modern Library list were threatened or removed
from bookstores, libraries and schools.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good time to celebrate our constitutional right to
read by reading a banned book. Give your child your favorite banned
book to read. Tell your child why you would miss the book that some
would ban forever. Visit your public library and check out a banned
book. It will be good for you.
</P>
<P>

Read Foundation Board, the litigating arm of the American Library
Association.)

 &HT;    Printing electronic postage stamps at home is an idea that might
stick
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someday soon, the conventional lick-it-and-stick-it-on postage
stamp may be as old-fashioned as the manual typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   Several sites on the World Wide Web now allow you to buy U.S.
postage stamps online and print the stamps at home, either using
special printers or your regular inkjet. A lot of people think that
e-stamps, as they're called, will eventually become the routine way
to buy stamps. But for now, it's still an infant technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leaders in the online stamp business is a Web site
called E-Stamp at www.estamp.com/.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the site explains and sells its service: ``With our
Internet Postage service you can buy and print your own postage,
right from your PC. No more trips to the post office. No more
waiting in lines.''
</P>
<P>
   To sign up with E-Stamp, you pay $50 for a little electronic
gadget E-Stamp calls a vault. That's where the electronic credits
for stamps are stored. You also get the software you need to print
the stamps, $25 worth of postage stamps, some mailing labels and a
CD that helps you find addresses and ZIP codes. After you've
started, you can buy more stamp credits from the Web site. You'll
pay what the company calls a ``convenience'' fee of 10 percent over
the face value of the stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The theory with E-Stamp and others is that you'll save money in
the long run because you can print out the right amount of postage
you need instead of just guessing and pasting on stamps until you
feel safe. The other advantage, which applies to all these
services, is the convenience of never running out of stamps (unless
you run out of money to buy more electronic stamps).
</P>
<P>
   The other big player in the electronic stamp arena is Pitney
Bowes (www.pitneybowes.com/). You've undoubtedly heard of that
company and probably associate it with the postage machines it has
sold to businesses for years.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the machines that allow businesses to print out
postage as they need it. In fact, these stand-alone postage
machines are the model for most Internet stamp services.
</P>
<P>
   Things are moving a little slow over at Pitney Bowes when it
comes to online postage. You won't find a mention of the service on
the home page. But if you click around enough (or just go to
www.pitneyworks.com/internetpostage/index.html), you'll find an
explanation of how Pitney Bowes is handling Internet postage.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get to the page, you'll find that the stamp program is
still in the beta test stage there. When checked last week, no new
beta test customers were being accepted. But, based on what the
page has to say about the program, it'll work very similar to the
E-Stamp program. You'll be able to print the stamps out with your
printer.
</P>
<P>
   Still another company offers online postage. That's Compaq, the
Houston-based manufacturer of personal computers. You can read
about the offer (which is identical to the E-Stamp offer, including
the 10 percent ``convenience'' fee) at
www.compaq.com/smb/onlineservices/postage.html. The reason, by the
way, that the two offers are identical is that if you press the
link to buy the Compaq service, you'll be whisked to the E-Stamp
page.

comes to online postage. You won't find a mention of the service on
the home page. But if you click around enough (or just go to
www.pitneyworks.com/internetpostage/index.html), you'll find an
explanation of how Pitney Bowes is handling Internet postage.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get to the page, you'll find that the stamp program is
still in the beta test stage there. When checked last week, no new
beta test customers were being accepted. But, based on what the
page has to say about the program, it'll work very similar to the
E-Stamp program. You'll be able to print the stamps out with your
printer.
</P>
<P>
   Still another company offers online postage. That's Compaq, the
Houston-based manufacturer of personal computers. You can read
about the offer (which is identical to the E-Stamp offer, including
the 10 percent ``convenience'' fee) at
www.compaq.com/smb/onlineservices/postage.html. The reason, by the
way, that the two offers are identical is that if you press the
link to buy the Compaq service, you'll be whisked to the E-Stamp
page.

</P>
<P>
   This week, ``She Said Yes: The Unlikely Martyrdom of Cassie
Bernall'' landed on the Amazon.com ``hot books'' list. Written by
Cassie's mother, Misty, the book recounts the faith of one of the
teenagers killed in the Columbine High School massacre in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses, before killing her, Eric Harris asked,
``Do you believe in God?'' Cassie responded, ``Yes.'' As he pulled
the trigger, he further tormented: ``Why?'' She could not answer.
She lay dying from a bullet in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Since the shooting, Cassie has become something of a teen idol
for conservative Christians. Cassie martyr-mania has created web
sites, T-shirts, buttons, pins and videosall fuelling a teen
revival.
</P>
<P>
   Television evangelists recount the story as a modern morality
tale. One intones solemnly, ``Satan wants to steal an entire
generation, but Cassie stood up for God. Will you?''
</P>
<P>
   This is the new sawdust trail,replete with hellfire and
brimstone. Old-time religion told through the tragedy of a blond
teenager wearing Doc Martens.
</P>
<P>
   But ``She Said Yes'' is no revival sermon as Misty Bernall
corrects the hellfire hype. In these pages, Cassie is no martyr.
She is a troubled teen who, with her parents' help, goes
straightonly to be killed shortly thereafter by a more troubled
classmate.
</P>
<P>
   Even after becoming a Christian, she struggled with feelings of
depression, hating her parents, desires for love and sexual
passion, and doubts about God. When the moment of death came,
however, she faced it with courage. She said ``Yes'' to ultimate
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the martyr narratives that shaped early Christianity,
Cassie is not endued with supernatural insight or given miraculous
visions. Nor are her parents. She is just a kid. And they are
confused parents.
</P>
<P>
   Therein is the book's power. This is not a martyr's tale. It is
a mourner's meditation-- a mother's story of the death of a
belovedand normalteeenager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cassie is my daughter,'' writes Misty Bernall protectively.
``You can't turn her into Joan of Arc.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``She Said Yes,'' no one looks particularly heroic. Cassie is
deeply flawed. Her parents resort to extreme measures-- spying,
cutting off her friendships, forcing her into a Christian school
--to save their daughter. They realize the painful irony of
Cassie's life-- had they not redirected their daughter, she would
still be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, through much of the narrative, the grief-stricken Misty
Bernall tries to justify her own parental choices.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dr. Laura and Pat Robertson forward their own narrow
agendas by using Cassie, the spirituality of her story is not that
of the religious right. Instead, Cassie's story reflects a
tradition different from that of American evangelicalism --that of
Anabaptist theology and piety. ``She Said Yes'' is published by
Plough, an Anabaptist publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans confuse Anabaptists with more generic Baptists.
Anabaptists are the heirs of the 500-year-old tradition of the
peace churches,the Mennonites being the largest. Theologically,
Anabaptists emphasize discipleship and quiet faith. Their piety
runs counter to the more extroverted ``accept Jesus and get born
again'' ethos of much American Protestantism.
</P>
<P>
   ``She Said Yes'' is about discipleship,another term for the
spiritual journey of saying yes to God. Cassie's yes was not a
once-for-all. She had to keep saying it amid her troubles: Yes,
yes, and yes. These yes's transformedbut not did not perfecther
character. She was a girl in the process of becoming a better
person through saying yes.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother criticizes ``accept Jesus'' piety. She worries about
``hellfire and brimstone'' Christians. She questioned her
daughter's faith commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Misty Bernall rarely uses the exclusive ``Christ'' language of
evangelical piety. Instead, she opts to tell her readers of
Cassie's faith in ``God.'' The book is riddled with doubts -- a
pious taboo among evangelicals but an important aspect of mature
faith.
</P>
<P>
   With this counterpoint to evangelical piety, the Bernalls point
toward a vision of faith not often seen in American culture. For
them, life is an uneasy journey of commitment to God, a life of
quiet, consistent and insistent ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   However quietly said, ``yes'' is a powerful word. Sadly,
Cassie's journey ended with an unexpectedly dramatic ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   But her faith was not ``turn-or-burn.'' Rather, it was a
pilgrimage of saying yes in love: a mother's love for her daughter,
a girl's love for God, and a teenager learning to love herself. And
it is the pain of a saying yes even when a journey ends too soon.
That is a witness for all of usnot matter what our faith tradition
may be.

Wednesday, Sept. 29. If you have any questions, please call The

<P>
   FOOD-BBQ-KANSAS (Kansas City, Mo.) _ Ardie Davis has been
hitting the barbecue sauce pretty hard.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is he has probably drunk a swimming pool's worth of the
stuff over the years yet still always manages to keep enough sauce
on hand to fill up a good-sized bath tub.
</P>
<P>
   While working on The Great BBQ Sauce Book (Ten Speed Press,
$15.95), Davis was on a first-name basis with the UPS driver who
dropped off ``hundreds'' of long-neck bottles, funky flasks, clunky
moonshine jugs and mayonnaise jars containing the condiment on the
doorstep of his Roeland Park, Kan., home. 1150 words. By JILL
WENDHOLT SILVA. Story will move in the ``l'' category.
</P>
<P>
   CD-9INCH-KANSAS (undated) _ It's been five years since Nine Inch
Nails' ``The Downward Spiral'' established its mastermind, Trent
Reznor, as the poster boy for malicious electronic rock.
</P>
<P>
   That album's death-disco hit, ``Closer,'' with its unprintable
catch phrase and creepy video, was a remarkably dark point in the
already gloomy grunge scene, and it made a star out of its creator.
</P>
<P>
   Reznor finally has re-emerged with his third album, ``The
Fragile,'' a double disc that explores many of the same emotional
depths as its predecessors, but with a more refined sense of
modulation and restraint. It's a quixotic, challenging work that
cements Reznor's reputation for sound and fury, yet also gives
voice to a softer, more nuanced side of NIN. 500 words. By DEREK
DONOVAN. Story will move in the ``e'' category.
</P>
<P>
   TV-TOOYOUNG-KANSAS (Pacific Palisades, Calif.) _ It's another
pristine day at Jacqueline Kennedy High School in Southern
California, just a mile up the hill from Pacific Coast Highway. Out
on the large, oval-shaped quad, kids are tossing a football, eating
at the outdoor cafeteria, looking out from a second-story railing
toward the ocean. Here, 20-something actors pretend to be teens for
a show that a bunch of 40-something TV executives hope will draw an
audience of 12- to 34-year-olds. That's show business!
</P>
<P>
   There are eight new shows that fit that exact MO. Add in the
ones that reverse the premise _ shows about 20-somethings that
teen-agers will want to watch _ and you're easily talking a third,
if not one-half, of the new kids on the TV block. 950 words. By
AARON BARNHART. Story will move in the ``e'' category.

</P>
<P>
   WITH: CYBERSPICE: Twentieth century scientific and technological

modern life begins by rediscovering the convivial joy of the table.

a valuable tool in selecting a college. (Includes 1 column color
mug shot of columnist.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH BRIEFS: Every state has at least one whipping boy, a
neighboring state that serves as the butt of jokes. The Great
Mobile Homes of Mississippi, www.kelleys.org/mhomes/, is the Web
site that takes aim at Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: GADGETS: If you want a five-channel home theater sound
system but you'd rather not clutter your room with big speakers,

2-column color photo of a historic fort and a 2-column color photo
of birds making nests in the fort wall.)

San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: BEAUTY IN THE BERKSHIRES: In his famous song ``Alice's
Restaurant,'' Arlo Guthrie immortalized a hole-in-the-wall

   TRENDY PUP: Look into the yellow eyes of the Blue Dog, and what

answers,'' suggests George Rodrigue, the Louisiana artist who

illustrated new book. (Includes 2-column photo from book and a

HIS NAME IN SAUCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL WENDHOLT SILVA  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Ardie Davis has been hitting the barbecue
sauce pretty hard.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is he has probably drunk a swimming pool's worth of the
stuff over the years yet still always manages to keep enough sauce
on hand to fill up a good-sized bath tub.
</P>
<P>
   While working on The Great BBQ Sauce Book (Ten Speed Press,
$15.95), Davis was on a first-name basis with the UPS driver who
dropped off ``hundreds'' of long-neck bottles, funky flasks, clunky
moonshine jugs and mayonnaise jars containing the condiment on the
doorstep of his Roeland Park, Kan., home.
</P>
<P>
   As traditional tomato-based, vinegar-based and mustard-based
sauces duked it out with more exotic gourmet versions spiked with
raspberries, papaya, mango or Scotch bonnet peppers, Davis ended up
collecting so many bottles of the stuff that his wife, Gretchen,
felt compelled to ``allot a certain amount of space'' in the
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   As readers flip through Davis' 160-page illustrated guide,
they'll find descriptions of more than 300 commercially-available
barbecue sauces are divided into ``sweet,'' ``tangy'' and ``fiery''
chapters.
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone looking to buy a sauce, they want to know if it is
sweet or tangy, and if it was going to bite them,'' Davis says.
``Regions don't make sense anymore because we're so global, and you
can find just about any sauce on Web sites or through catalogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Published last month, The Great BBQ Sauce Book already has gone
into its second printing. This is Davis' second book. He is also
author of The Kansas City BBQ Pocket Guide.
</P>
<P>
   Like fine wine, Davis says, the best sauces have their own
distinct nuances. Some sauces are ``hickory-kissed'' while others
finish with a ``peppery heat.'' There are sauces spiked with a hint
of garlic or ``embellished with molasses.'' Some make ``make your
mouth feel mellow'' while others are ``hot enough to make your
tongue tingle.''
</P>
<P>
   From the gritty taste of Kansas City's legendary Arthur Bryant's
to Big Bob Gibson's Bar-B-Q Original White Sauce, an oddly speckled
mayonnaise indigenous to parts of Alabama, Davis says he didn't
find any sauce so disagreeable that he was forced to spit it out,
though he concedes that he tasted ``plenty that were just so-so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt if anybody in this city, including myself, has tasted
and judged as many sauces as he has,'' says Rich Davis, inventor of
the original K.C. Masterpiece and no relation to Ardie Davis. ``No
one has focused that finely on the barbecue sauce world.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctoring the sauce
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Oklahoma City, Okla., Davis' dad bought the most
inexpensive barbecue sauce on the supermarket shelves and doctored
it up to suit the family's tastes.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until he moved to Kansas City in 1977 that Davis
discovered his passion for barbecue sauce. In 1984, he organized
the first Diddy-Wa-Diddy National Barbecue Sauce Contest featuring
close to 104 commercially-available sauces, on the patio and deck
of his home.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kirk, a friend, neighbor, barbecue expert and the author of
Paul Kirk's Championship Barbecue Sauces (Harvard Common Press),
was a judge at the first contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to see how sauces around the country would compare
to Arthur Bryant's because it was his favorite _ and it didn't
compare very well,'' Kirk recalls, ``but we still love Arthur
Bryant's.''
</P>
<P>
   what triggered idea was reading Jane and Michael Stern's Road
food. 80-some bbq rest in that book. new I couldn't travel way they
do and decided to write
</P>
<P>
   By 1987, the contest had grown so large it was renamed the
American Royal International Barbecue Sauce, Rub &AMP; Baste Contest.
The 16th annual contest, sponsored by the Kansas City Barbeque
Society will be held this Saturday weekend at Governors Exposition
Building at the Americna Royal Complex and is expected to feature
over 400 entries, including several from foreign countries, making
it the largest sauce contest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I started the (barbecue sauce) contest, I just had my
radar out for sauces, and word of mouth just got out,'' Davis says.
``People would send me sauces and want me to taste it and give my
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   At Davis' urging, Karen Putman finally decided to bottle her
raspberry-flavored barbecue sauce. A red-headed woman who in the
early days sweated it out with her mostly male competitors at
barbecue contests, Davis dubbed her the Flower of the Flames, a
name that stuck and now appears on the label of her barbecue sauce
which she bottles in Lenexa.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a really wonderful palate,'' Putman says of her
friend and mentor. ``Plus, he loves barbecue. He can eat barbecue
for breakfast, lunch and dinner _ and snacks in between. No matter
where he goes or what he does, he always picks up more sauces to
taste.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Other people maybe taste as many sauces, but sometimes they're
overly critical,'' says Brian Heinecke, director of public
relations for the National Barbecue Society. ``They tend to narrow
their focus to only sweet ketchup, tomato-based tastes. Ardie has
an appreciation for the breadth of styles... so people seem very
open to him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People put a lot of ego into their sauces,'' Davis says, ``so
when I'm writing about them I was always mindful that it is
precious stuff to the people who make it. It's sort of love me,
love my sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   Alter-barbecue-ego
</P>
<P>
   A shy, soft-spoken, thoughtful man, Davis recreates himself
through barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   By day he commutes to Topeka where he serves as the commission
of advocacy services at the Kansas Department of Aging, a position
appointed by the Governor.
</P>
<P>
   But on the weekends he transforms himself into the gregarious
Remus Powers, PhB., a persona that pays tribute to the stories of
Brer Rabbit and Powers, a ``James Dean-type'' auto mechanic Davis
admired while growing up. The PhB. denotes a ``doctorate in
barbecue'' _ an honor conferred on a handful of self-taught
barbecue experts.
</P>
<P>
   His alter-barbecue-ego is easy to spot at barbecue contests. He
wears a black derby, bow tie and a white apron with three rib bones
pinned to it. A white ceramic spoon haging on a gold string from
his apron is at the ready whenever a spontaneous sauce tasting
presents itself.
</P>
<P>
   A charter member of the Kansas City Barbeque Society, Davis'
other passion is writing. For years, he has written a monthly
column for the past decade in organization's newsletter under the
pen name Remus Powers, PhB.
</P>
<P>
   Davis wears the costume when he administers the oath he wrote
for judges at the American Royal Invitational Barbecue Contest,
part of which pledges to preserve ``truth, justice, excellence in
barbecue and the American way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I love barbecue is it's a community builder, and I
think barbecue brings people together in a positive way,'' Davis
says.
</P>
<P>
   From his home office _ a room in a basement that is no wider
than most men are tall _ Davis has literally carved out a niche for
himself. The stone walls of his tiny shrine//office are covered
with a mishmash of barbecue memorabilia _ pins, newspaper
clippings, cartoon pigs and the odd empty barbecue sauce bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Known to his friends as a sort of barbecue philosopher,
long-time friend and executive director of the KCBS, Carolyn Wells
says of Davis, ``He's transferred his love of barbecue into the
book. It's obvious it's part of his soul.''

NINE INCH NAILS' `THE FRAGILE' EXHIBITS A REFINED FORMULA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DEREK DONOVAN  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been five years since Nine Inch Nails' ``The Downward
Spiral'' established its mastermind, Trent Reznor, as the poster
boy for malicious electronic rock.
</P>
<P>
   That album's death-disco hit, ``Closer,'' with its unprintable
catch phrase and creepy video, was a remarkably dark point in the
already gloomy grunge scene, and it made a star out of its creator.
</P>
<P>
   Reznor finally has re-emerged with his third album, ``The
Fragile,'' a double disc that explores many of the same emotional
depths as its predecessors, but with a more refined sense of
modulation and restraint. It's a quixotic, challenging work that
cements Reznor's reputation for sound and fury, yet also gives
voice to a softer, more nuanced side of NIN.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Downward Spiral'' was about a life falling apart, and the
new album can be viewed as its aftermath. The protagonist of ``The
Fragile'' has formed a bulletproof shell of bitterness over past
betrayals, yet he is now, believe it or not, clearly in love.
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to imagine the Reznor of old uttering
lyrics such as ``We will make it through somehow'' or ``She
shines//In a world full of ugliness,'' but NIN has turned a corner.
Although the majority of the new songs concern the familiar
territory of suffering and emotional decay, there is an underlying
longing and even hope to ``The Fragile'' that saves it from
monotony.
</P>
<P>
   Musically the album owes debts to many styles in the rock
lexicon. While there is plenty of harrowing heavy metal thunder,
Reznor and co-producer Alan Moulder have explored subtlety and
texture much more thoroughly than in the previous two NIN albums.
Cellos, marimbas, even ukuleles and a marching band weave in and
out of the angry guitar//synth//drum arrangements, but Reznor and
Moulder successfully keep the instrumentation from the extravagance
of the silliest acts of the '70s (think ELO or Giorgio Moroder).
</P>
<P>
   However, that decade's influence does indeed loom large over
``The Fragile,'' from its Led Zeppelin guitar licks to the thick
buzz of the instrumental track ``Just Like You Imagined,'' which
would sound perfectly at home on a vintage Yes or King Crimson LP.
Reznor even includes a recognizable Kiss sample in his palette of
sonic colors.
</P>
<P>
   The NIN sound is based heavily in synthesizers and samplers, but
``The Fragile'' shares few common traits with the bleepy
electronica of clubland. Instead Reznor and Moulder tend toward
oddly deconstructed samples of low-tech instruments playing
machinelike riffs, like the repeating acoustic guitar on the
opening track, ``Somewhat Damaged.'' Their approach to the
synthesizer is surprisingly traditional and melodic, with its roots
firmly planted in the beefy Moog synthesizer lines of progressive
rock and early-1980s funk.
</P>
<P>
   Styles reminiscent of other artists are scattered throughout the
album, but Reznor always filters them through the unique prism of
NIN. The song ``We're in This Together'' employs a distinctively
Kornlike riff. ``Into the Void'' and ``Where Is Everybody'' are
slow-burn grooves worthy of old-school Prince or mid-period Gary
Numan. The mood and sound of Depeche Mode inform almost every track
in some fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fragile'' is a Nine Inch Nails record in every way, novel
yet instantly familiar. It is an album that will bear repeated
listenings, offering up new insights and relationships for some
time to come. If the lyrics are somewhat redundant and rhymes are
occasionally forced (``Watching fate as it flows//Down the path we
have chose''), the album's forte remains its dynamic ebb and flow.
</P>
<P>
   Reznor's grimy marriage of rock, pop, funk and electronics is
more than mere pastiche; it is a personal aesthetic that he has
realized more fully with every album. ``The Fragile'' is a vital
and cohesive statement, and it was worth the five-year wait.

   PACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. _ It's another pristine day at
Jacqueline Kennedy High School in Southern California, just a mile
up the hill from Pacific Coast Highway. Out on the large,
oval-shaped quad, kids are tossing a football, eating at the
outdoor cafeteria, looking out from a second-story railing toward
the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of idyllic campus scene one might see on TV _
which is only fitting, because you will. An actual high school
situated in this tony beachside town, a short drive down Sunset
from Beverly Hills, has been converted into the set of ``Popular,''
the quintessential program of the 1999-2000 TV season.
</P>
<P>
   Here, 20-something actors pretend to be teens for a show that a
bunch of 40-something TV executives hope will draw an audience of
12- to 34-year-olds. That's show business!
</P>
<P>
   There are eight new shows that fit that exact MO. Add in the
ones that reverse the premise _ shows about 20-somethings that
teen-agers will want to watch _ and you're easily talking a third,
if not one-half, of the new kids on the TV block.
</P>
<P>
   Shows like ``Roswell'' (aliens mingle with teens), ``Wasteland''
(life after college in New York), ``Safe Harbor'' (single dad,
teen-age sons), ``Mission Hill'' (cartoon slackers), ``Get Real''
(kids struggle with school by day, parents by night), ``Freaks and
Geeks'' (same deal, but in 1980) and ``Manchester Prep'' (title
says it all).
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, ``Popular,'' which ironically may be the least
pandering of the bunch, but has taken the name that perfectly
captures this acne-riddled trend.
</P>
<P>
   After all, who gets anywhere in life just by winning popularity
contests?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: teen-agers and TV executives.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, five of the six networks rushed at least one program
onto its fall schedule containing such teen-angst staples as
cliques, peer pressure, absurdist grown-ups and, of course, moist
inter-gender relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other networks have completely focused on the teens, the
18-to-34 and the 18-to-49 audience,'' says Nancy Tellem,
entertainment president of CBS, the one network to buck the trend.
``Their programming has become indistinguishable.''
</P>
<P>
   And the people we have to thank for this adolescent surge are
the executives at the WB. The network's total Nielsen numbers lag
far behind the big four but, by Madison Avenue's standards, they're
hotter than a Britney Spears chat room.
</P>
<P>
   The WB targets only 12- to 34-year-olds; its median viewer is
age 26, making it by far the ``youngest'' of the six networks. WB
viewers have record amounts of disposable income and spend it on
movies, music and eating out. Advertising research also shows
younger viewers more open to switching brands (though other
networks, notably CBS, argue otherwise).
</P>
<P>
   After floundering its first two years with a sitcom-heavy
lineup, the WB changed course to one-hour shows in 1997. It started
with a tongue-in-cheek thriller, ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer,''
that cast the daily traumas of high school life against a backdrop
of a town infested by underworld demons.
</P>
<P>
   Fronted by its star Sarah Michelle Gellar and her fetching
on-screen beau David Boreanaz, ``Buffy'' became the archetypal 12-
to 34-year-old show. High school was a ruse, an excuse to load up
the show's cast with fresh-scrubbed beauties, while the scripts
played more to the ironic, unflappable tastes of slightly older
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1998, with the arrival of ``Dawson's Creek,'' the WB
took off. Besides creating two instant teen idols in Katie Holmes
and James Van Der Beek, ``Dawson's Creek'' also made it fashionable
to write soap operas for adolescents. Last season another WB
soaper, ``Felicity,'' followed in ``Dawson's'' footsteps, and this
year ``Jack and Jill'' plans to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Although WB shows aren't even in Nielsen's top 100 overall,
``Dawson's Creek'' was No. 9 among teens and the WB placed nine
shows among last year's top 50 among the 12-to-17 age group.
</P>
<P>
   (The network's top-rated show is actually the wholesome but
teen-friendly ``7th Heaven,'' about a minister, his wife and their
oversized family. The WB also had six of the top 10 programs among
black teens, led by ``The Steve Harvey Show.'')
</P>
<P>
   The WB is equally impressive among 18- to 34-year-old viewers
who like fast food, the Gap, sporty but sensible cars and using
their MasterCard. Last season the WB was the only network that
didn't lose viewership in this age group _ ratings, in fact, were
up 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So now the other networks are playing catchup and trying to cash
in on the surge in teen (and post-teen) spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year there's a particular trend and this year it's this
big blowout of Generation Y,'' says Ryan Murphy, the co-creator of
``Popular.'' ``Everybody wants on that bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, consider the feeding frenzy that took place late
last year when Murphy and Gina Matthews were shopping ``Popular''
to the networks. ABC, NBC, Fox, the WB and even CBS made offers.
Ultimately, Murphy says, the WB won out ``because they're smart
about creative decisions, they give you a lot of license, and they
really know how to market these shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy says ``Popular'' is a deceptive show because, while
seeming to chronicle the cruelties of teenagerdom, it's really
about that grown-up and more universal urge, ambition. As such,
it's less about Brooke, the sassy blond cheerleader played by
Leslie Bibb, than it is about Sam (Carly Pope), the editor of the
school paper, who's determined to ignore the stifling culture of
cool as well as insecurities about her own self-image. (The two
girls' paths merge unavoidably when Sam's mother and Brooke's
father get engaged.)
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the WB's schedule, it is not hard to see the
convergence of artistic expression and brand management. ``Buffy,
the Vampire Slayer'' has been matched on Tuesday nights with its
spinoff, ``Angel,'' starring Boreanaz. On Wednesdays, ``Dawson's
Creek'' leads into ``Roswell,'' an equally agreeable pairing
despite the latter's ``X-Files'' ingredient. On Sundays two
coming-of-age relationship dramas form a tandem, ``Felicity'' and
``Jack and Jill.''
</P>
<P>
   The WB's entertainment president Susanne Daniels says that's the
way you build viewer loyalty: by having a schedule that's
wall-to-wall with shows tailored to their niche tastes. Other
networks are free to imitate their program selections, she says,
but they can't imitate the WB's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: On Thursdays ABC surrounds ``Wasteland,'' a new
20-something drama from ``Dawson's Creek'' creator Kevin
Williamson, with a game show and a newsmagazine, neither of which
is likely to help ``Wasteland'' build an audience.  &LR; tag1:To reach

GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE AD IGNITES DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE CONSTANTINOU  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Texas company is offering $560,000 to pay the
tolls on the Golden Gate Bridge for a day and hang an advertising
banner on the approach to the landmark.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal by carOrder.com of Austin has turned sour in
the city on the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The company, an Internet automobile broker, wrote a letter to
Golden Gate Bridge District General Manager Celia Kupersmith asking
if the it could hang the advertising banner on the tollbooth
leading to the bridge, which is on eastern side of the Bay in Marin
County.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the bridge agency rejects commercial ventures, but
these are not normal times, said Mary Currie, the bridge district
spokeswoman. The general manager had just returned from Washington,
D.C., she said, and it didn't look as if the bridge was going to
get much federal help with the $171 million that is needed for a
$297 million project to make the span safer in earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She saw it as a significant amount of money that she just
didn't want to walk away from,'' Currie said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the bridge district and the Texas company were
negotiating. As part of their advertising gimmick, the Texas folks
wanted to pay everyone's $3 toll and have the banner read that it
was the company's treat.
</P>
<P>
   Reimbursing the bridge district for the lost tolls would cost
the company about $160,000. Then, there would be an additional
$400,000 for the privilege of bragging in a banner about paying the
tolls.
</P>
<P>
   The banner would hang at the toll plaza _ not the towers or
under the bridge span _ where another banner now advertises the
Larkspur ferry. The banner size would be about 20 feet long and 3
feet high.
</P>
<P>
   To San Francisco Supervisor Barbara Kaufman, the proposal was
like found money. Heck, why stop at just one day? How about Banner
Day once a month?
</P>
<P>
   ``If they'll pay, why not others?'' said Kaufman, who is a board
member of the Golden Gate Bridge District.
</P>
<P>
   But to fellow supervisor and bridge director Michael Yaki, the
banner idea on the beloved icon is sacrilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletes are walking billboards. Every stadium is subject to
corporate sponsorship,'' Yaki said. ``Once you go down that path
... why not have General Electric sponsor the torch on the Statue
of Liberty ... or hang a sign on the mayor's balcony: `AT&AMP;T
Welcomes You to City Hall'?''
</P>
<P>
   To Yaki, any amount of money the bridge district could raise by
permitting a banner would not be enough to pay for what they feel
would be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you've done is sold the bridge,'' he said. ``Why even put
a price tag on integrity, on dignity, on something that represents
California and the United States?''
</P>
<P>
   But Kaufman thinks that all this melodrama is hogwash. ``It's
not on the bridge, it's on the toll booth,'' she said. ``To say
we're desecrating the bridge is nonsense.''

SKIN DISORDER COMMON AMONG BLACKS FRUSTRATES DOCTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The first white spots appeared on her 7-year-old
daughter's back and knee. Although they were no bigger than
quarters, Jodie Glass was worried.
</P>
<P>
   She had seen those same kinds of spots on her best friend, who
suffers from a genetic skin disorder known as vitiligo. A doctor
confirmed Glass' suspicion in July, when the white spots had spread
to her daughter's stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know, from growing up with my best friend, what it's
going to be like for her,'' said Glass, an mother of two who lives
in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Between 2 million and 4 million Americans suffer from vitiligo,
a condition in which the skin's pigmentation cells are destroyed
and no longer able to produce the melanin that normally gives the
body its color.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a patchwork of white spots that can, in severe
cases, cover the entire body, including the face and hands.
</P>
<P>
   Although vitiligo can affect people of any race or gender, it's
most noticeable and disfiguring in people of color. ``The big myth
about this disease is that it's an African-American problem,'' said
Shannon Ruesewald, director of the National Vitiligo Foundation in
Tyler, Texas. ``I think many people see the condition and don't
know what it's called or they say, `It's the Michael Jackson
disease.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, the pop icon, is reported to have undergone a bleaching
treatment to even out his skin color after his natural pigment was
destroyed by the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   And while destroying the remaining pigment cells is one approach
to dealing with the disease, Glass is frustrated by the fact that
vitiligo is still an incurable disease with no known cause or good
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   While some people opt to bleach their skin, others may try to
add pigment, either with makeup or dye. Yet most insurance
companies don't cover the cost of those treatments, calling them
either experimental or cosmetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much we can do,'' said Glass, a secretary at the
New York state Department of Health. ``Her stomach and back are
about 50 percent covered. Jessica has it behind her knees, her neck
and it's starting around her cheeks. I can't think about it without
crying.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure what triggers vitiligo but about half the people
who develop the condition show some sign of pigment loss before the
age of 20.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers believe vitiligo may be caused by a combination of
factors related to the body's genes, the immune and nervous
systems.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Vitiligo Foundation, many people
report pigment loss after a severe sunburn. Others relate the onset
of vitiligo to emotional trauma stemming from an accident, death in
the family or divorce. For others, the disease appears for no
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in my family that we know has it,'' Glass said.
</P>
<P>
   Vitiligo doesn't usually indicate any serious medical problems,
although it has been linked to certain autoimmune conditions
associated with thyroid and adrenal gland function.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest issue is that in areas where you don't have any
pigment, you're going to sunburn and if you sunburn, you're going
to increase your risk for skin cancer,'' said Dr. Mitchell Singer,
a dermatologist in Schenectady.
</P>
<P>
   Other than counseling patients on the appropriate use of
sunscreens, Singer says physicians unfortunately don't have much to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   The mainstay of treatment for vitiligo patients is a combination
of drug therapy and ultraviolet light to encourage repigmentation.
</P>
<P>
   A year's worth of treatment, however, can cost up to $6,000,
requires weekly visits to the doctor and offers only mixed results,
Singer said. ``Most people have to live with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Glass has found out with her daughter, the emotional impact
of vitiligo is especially difficult in a culture that places such
an emphasis on beauty and appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a 7-year-old to tell you, `Why do I have to be ugly?' What
can you say?'' Glass said.
</P>
<P>
   While the disorder sometimes goes away and the skin repigments
on its own, most people aren't so fortunate. Glass is pushing for
more research to find a cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a prayer and a medical breakthrough, Jessica just might
be able to beat this disease,'' she said.
</P>

Vitiligo Foundation in Tyler, Texas, 903-531-0074.)

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A quiet couple from Oregon is rising on the charts of the
evangelical publishing world, gaining remarkable success in the
highly competitive market for devotional prayer books.
 &HT;    At the same time they have created a unique bridge between
conservative Christians and mainliners on the often divisive
subjects of prayer and scripture.
 &HT;    David and Heather Kopp are authors of the best-selling ``Praying
the Bible'' series, which Waterbrook began releasing two years ago.
The titles include ``Praying The Bible For Your Life'' ... ``For
Your Children'' ... ``For Your Marriage'' ... ``For Your Baby.''
Soon to come: ``Praying The Bible For Your Teen-ager.''
 &HT;    Praying scripture was common to ancient Israel. It was common to
early Christians. It is a concept that has defined monastic
communities for literally centuries. Monks gather daily -- starting
in pre-dawn hours -- to chant the Psalms or sing the Magnificat or
recite the creation story, all as forms of prayers.
 &HT;    The Kopps took this concept and created books that focus on an
individual's spiritual journey, relationships and family life.
 &HT;    For instance, ``Praying The Bible For Your Life'' includes 130
prayers based on bible passages from Genesis to Revelations.
 &HT;    In ``Praying The Bible For Your Marriage,'' prayers address
everything from minor spats to sexual intimacy and put heavy
emphasis on unity of spirit. ``When the winds of trouble howl,
seeking to enter through cracks in the plaster, our hearts will be
secure, and we will have no fear (Psalm 112:8). Even on stormy
days, peace will dwell within our walls (Psalm 122:7).''
 &HT;    The series is a best-seller in ``the crossover market'' of both
evangelical conservatives and mainline Christians.
 &HT;    The Kopps' newest project is as unique as their ``Praying The
Bible'' series.
 &HT;    Just released by Harvest House Publishers, ``Praying For The
World's 365 Most Influential People'' reads like an evangelical
People Magazine and has a goal of literally changing the world.
 &HT;    The devotional book admonishes Christians to join efforts every
single day next year to pray for celebrities.
 &HT;    From Leonardo DiCaprio, Lauryn Hill and Will Smith to Pope John
II, the Clintons, the Dalai Lama and even Fidel Castro, the list of
names reflects the biblical mandate to pray ``for everyone -- for
kings and those in authority.
 &HT;    As the Kopps see it, this extends also to the famous -- and
infamous.
 &HT;    From the despicable Saddam Hussein to the bizarre Marilyn
Manson, the book urges readers to cross the tidy boundaries that
often define evangelical Christianity and pray for people they'd
rather ignore -- or even curse.
 &HT;    ``Christians for the most part, write (devotions) for other
Christians, and too often there is an 'us against them' mentality
regarding society,'' Heather Kopp said. ``The power of prayer and
the need for prayer -- these are things every person of faith can
agree on.''
 &HT;    Michael Jordan, Steven Spielberg, Jim Carrey and Chris Rock join
Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire on the roster of celebrities.
 &HT;    The Kopps also included Ellen Johnson, president of American
Atheists, and went so far as to ask her for an endorsement.
 &HT;    ``I thought it'd be great if she said something like, 'You can
pray for me, but hey-- no one's listening,''' David Kopp said. ``A
little opposition is good for a prayer movement.''
 &HT;    According to David, Johnson declined to endorse the book but did
ask him directly if she was an adversary in the text.
 &HT;    ``I assured her that readers were not going to pray against her
but for God's best for her and her life,'' he said.
 &HT;    For David Kopp, the experience of praying the Bible began in
infancy. He was born in Zambia, to missionary parents, and his
father had a serious speech impediment.
 &HT;    ``He found that Bible memorization helped him overcome his
handicap,'' Kopp said. ``His prayers and his everyday conversations
were always filled with scripture. I can hear his voice when I read
my Bible.''

   BRAD-PROFILE-COX _ CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. _ Thirty-five miles south
of where it joins the Missouri River, the Mississippi churns past a
tiny spit of dirt known as Hug Farm. The river narrows here, and
the current moves swiftly, a chocolate ribbon that carves through
flat farmlands and rushes past steeply rising limestone bluffs. As
the setting sun turned the scene here to shadows earlier this
month, two touring buses rumbled to a halt and deposited Bill
Bradley and about 50 members of the press. It was the final stop on
the ``Bill Bradley for President'' home tour, a 60-minute field
trip intended to acquaint the media with Bradley's small-town
roots. With reporters scribbling notes and photographers snapping
away, Bradley explained how as a teenager he would run from Crystal
City High School to the river's edge and, standing alone, inhale
the silence. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. _ Thirty-five miles south of where it joins
the Missouri River, the Mississippi churns past a tiny spit of dirt
known as Hug Farm. The river narrows here, and the current moves
swiftly, a chocolate ribbon that carves through flat farmlands and
rushes past steeply rising limestone bluffs.
</P>
<P>
   As the setting sun turned the scene here to shadows earlier this
month, two touring buses rumbled to a halt and deposited Bill
Bradley and about 50 members of the press. It was the final stop on
the ``Bill Bradley for President'' home tour, a 60-minute field
trip intended to acquaint the media with Bradley's small-town
roots.
</P>
<P>
   With reporters scribbling notes and photographers snapping away,
Bradley explained how as a teenager he would run from Crystal City
High School to the river's edge and, standing alone, inhale the
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want all of you to see the river the way I see the river,''
said Bradley, who bought Hug Farm in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But seeing the river, it turned out, wasn't all that Bradley
wanted. What attracted him to this place then and now was not the
sight of the river, but the feel of it. The quiet. The stillness.
The solitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world where there is news on the hour and there is a lot
of instant gratification, this place, this river and those bluffs
were for me a sense of permanence,'' he told the media gaggle.
``Even with this crowd, you get a sense of the solitude.''
</P>
<P>
   On one level, Bradley's river tour was scripted political
theater, portraying a contemplative man bound by birth to one of
the most potent symbols of American greatness, the mighty
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   But the vignette also revealed much about a figure who has lived
life in the public eye since the age of 14, from his basketball
glory days in Crystal City to the 16-hour days he now campaigns for
president.
</P>
<P>
   The essential truth about Bradley is that he is pulled most
strongly to the interiors of life. Introspective and at times
reserved, he covets isolation the way President Clinton craves the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to be private in order to replenish,'' says Ernestine
Schlant, a college professor _ and Emory University graduate _ whom
Bradley married in 1974. ``He almost has to go back within himself
... and then he can go out again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten months ago, Bradley entered the public spotlight once again
by becoming the only Democrat willing _ some said foolish enough _
to challenge Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1808 has a candidate successfully defeated a sitting
vice president for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, however, Bradley has obeyed an inner clock.
In 1978, he bucked the New Jersey Democratic Party by running
against the leadership's candidate in a bid for the Senate. His
only work experience was 10 years with the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Many urged him to run for president in 1988 when, four years
after a landslide re-election, he was at the peak of his
popularity. But he said he wasn't ready. He passed again in 1992,
listening to what he called an inner voice that told him the timing
was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Months after Bradley decided against a 1992 bid, his wife was
diagnosed with breast cancer. He drove her to every treatment
session. The inner voice was right.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, after briefly flirting with the idea of challenging
Clinton, possibly as an independent, Bradley instead retired from
the Senate, expressing profound disillusionment with politics and
the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's back, few question his timing anymore. Tapping
into unhappiness with the Clinton administration scandals, Bradley
is finding support among Democrats who believe Gore is too tainted.
</P>
<P>
   Next to Texas Gov. George W. Bush's sudden, early dominance,
Bradley's methodically executed campaign against Gore has so far
been the biggest surprise of the 2000 sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   With aggressive fund-raising and a message wrapped around the
American Dream, Bradley has proved that he can compete with Gore.
But there's a nagging question: Is a man who treasures solitude
ready to perform the world's most public role?
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Nelson practically tackled Bradley at a Democratic Party
barbecue near Ames, Iowa, this month. Thrusting out a copy of
Bradley's autobiography, ``Time Present, Time Past,'' Nelson said,
``I have never, ever voted for a Democrat. I am this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's encounters with voters frequently begin with an
autograph. Sometimes it is one of his books; more often it is a
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The signings hark back to Bradley's days as a basketball star
with the New York Knicks, when he helped win two NBA championships,
but they are also a testament to his continuing mystique.
</P>
<P>
   For a generation of American men, the Princeton graduate and
Rhodes scholar was proof that brains and athletic skill weren't
mutually exclusive. Consciously or unconsciously, Bradley has also
cultivated an image of integrity and independence both in
basketball and in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Rivers Blackmon, a diversity specialist from St. Louis
who met Bradley at a learning center for black children, said she
first read about him in college in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fact that he can be introspective,'' she said. ``A
lot of politicians seem to support the system instead of what is
right and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6-foot-5, Bradley towers more than most. And while he can be
professorial at times, he rarely seems to strike voters as aloof.
He succeeds, perhaps, because he talks about people, not ideology.
He tells a story about a woman he met who had no health insurance,
and another about a schoolteacher whose fourth-grade students had
no breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Such anecdotes, even if third-hand (the schoolteacher story came
from Minnesota Democrat Sen. Paul Wellstone), connect with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's the one kind of president who will really care
about people,'' said Melvin Lust, a county road worker in Newton,
Iowa. ``He's the kind of man I think we could sit down and visit
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlant, a native of Germany who teaches comparative literature
at Montclair State University in Upper Montclair, N.J., likes to
introduce her husband as the ``perfect blend'' of his schoolteacher
mother and banker father.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is indeed a product of both, but his parents'
personalities produced perhaps more tension than harmony in their
only child.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's father was a Republican in a town of Democrats, a man
who believed you made your own way in life. Warren Bradley suffered
from arthritis in his back, a condition that prevented him from
driving or even tying his own shoes.
</P>
<P>
   For all Bradley's athletic prowess, he never played any sports
with his father.
</P>
<P>
   A wealthy man who took his family to Florida in the winter,
Bradley's father was also painfully reserved. At town gatherings,
he was likely to be on the periphery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked his privacy,'' recalled neighbor Red Bryant. ``Bill's
a chip off of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's mother, Susie, was the extrovert. She was a Cub Scout
den mother and a church session leader. She organized dancing
parties for Bill's friends and pushed her son to learn the French
horn. She didn't take ``no'' for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   At Bradley's high school basketball games, she yelled at
referees over bad calls. She attended all his games and marked down
every shot that he took. The next day, he would practice the shots
he missed.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Crystal City that Bradley began to seek out places to
be alone. In addition to the river, there was the jungle gym behind
the high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a couple of occasions I would just go up there at night and
just lie on that bar and look at the stars,'' says Bradley, who
turned 56 in July. ``I learned early what you need to preserve
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The span of Bradley's life has included a number of such
timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Princeton in 1965, where he was a
three-time All-American, Bradley turned down an offer from the
Knicks and instead went to Oxford, England, as a Rhodes scholar.
</P>
<P>
   The cloisters of Oxford took Bradley away from the fame he had
already established as an athlete and allowed him to indulge his
voracious curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as a Knick, Bradley would play with the team, but then go
off exploring by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the guys would go back to their rooms and sleep,''
recalls Dewey Schade, a friend whom Bradley visited in San Diego.
``Bill would go and meet people, take notes and talk to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Willis Reed, a Knick teammate, remembers Bradley as a team
player who avoided the limelight and showed little emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really appreciated his privacy,'' says Reed. ``We basically
didn't know what he did off season.''
</P>
<P>
   Between seasons, Bradley traveled abroad, indulging his need to
wander and be on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like he has to satisfy his father's part that is
in himself,'' says Schlant.
</P>
<P>
   During 18 years in the Senate, Bradley established himself as a
thoughtful, hard-working senator and something of a loner.
</P>
<P>
   He developed an expertise in taxes, water management and world
monetary policy, displaying both liberal and conservative bents.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was one of the strongest supporters of the earned income
tax credit for the working poor, but he also voted for many of the
Reagan budget cuts of the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He had a strong pro-labor voting record, but was one of the
leading champions of the North American Free Trade Agreement, a
position that the nation's manufacturing unions vigorously oppose.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, he helped President Reagan pass the 1986 tax bill,
which cut rates dramatically but made up the revenue by eliminating
tax loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   He also supported aid to the Nicaraguan Contras and founded an
exchange program for U.S. and Russian students.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is at once laid-back and at the same time one of the most
disciplined and structured people I've ever known,'' says former
Louisiana Sen. J. Bennett Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley developed a few close friendships in Congress, across
the political spectrum. Wellstone, perhaps the Senate's most
liberal member, admired Bradley's ``intellectual integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the gold standard,'' says Republican Jack Kemp, a former
congressman, Cabinet member and vice presidential candidate. ``I
would consider him among the finest public servants I've ever
known.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone connected with Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him to be insensitive to the needs of people who live
in small towns and rural areas,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa),
who is supporting Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley angered some Democrats when he quit the Senate in
1996 and blamed the party for contributing to public cynicism about
American politics.
</P>
<P>
   In his last term, Bradley's only child, Theresa Anne, moved from
New Jersey to live with her father in Washington and attend private
school. Bradley and Schlant agreed that one of them would be home
every night to have dinner with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget any social evenings,'' he said. ``I did my job and went
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his Senate career, Bradley grew increasingly
critical of the influence of special interests in Congress and
advocated campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he has always been an skillful fund-raiser. He
raised millions from the special interests that he condemned,
gathering a staggering $12 million for his 1990 re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley says that no one ever influenced him with money. Yet he
aggressively defended the New Jersey-based pharmaceuticals
industry, which gave him thousands in contributions.
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly fought efforts to kill a tax break for U.S.
businesses in Puerto Rico, even though it was the type of tax
loophole he decried. Half the companies benefiting were
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also fought caps on prescription drug price increases
that drug companies opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is also not above the occasional flip-flop. In the
Senate, he fought ethanol subsidies as a taxpayer giveaway. Now,
running for president in Iowa, where the corn-based fuel additive
is a sacred cow, Bradley is in favor of the subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   With the earnestness of an Eagle Scout (which he was), Bradley
defends his votes in the name of some higher good. Protecting the
tax break in Puerto Rico, he says, was about preserving Puerto
Rican jobs. Voting against ethanol was saving New Jersey taxpayers
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of protecting your state's interest, I would try to
do that from time to time,'' Bradley says.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley left the Senate in 1996 sounding as though he might
never return to politics. Describing his reasons for quitting,
Bradley said in 1995 that he had become ``disgusted with the
politics of both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked for CBS News doing weekend commentaries, taught at
Stanford University and the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1998, he phoned Dan Okimoto, his Princeton
roommate. Okimoto had spoken to him before about the White House.
This time, Okimoto said, he detected a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``He realized that he felt ready and hungry,'' said Okimoto.
``That was always one of the questions I had, which was, Did he
really want the presidency, or was he conflicted about it?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley insists he's ready for the challenge, as long as he can
run on his own terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in sequential careers,'' he jokes. ``When I'm 80,
I'm going to learn how to play the piano. When I'm 82, I'm going to
open up a piano bar. There is always something out there that you
can enjoy doing. That kind of thought has kind of kept me moving.''

   BRAD-PROFILE-COX _ CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. _ Thirty-five miles south
of where it joins the Missouri River, the Mississippi churns past a
tiny spit of dirt known as Hug Farm. The river narrows here, and
the current moves swiftly, a chocolate ribbon that carves through
flat farmlands and rushes past steeply rising limestone bluffs. As

   CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. _ Thirty-five miles south of where it joins

three-time All-American, Bradley turned down an offer from the
Knicks and instead went to Oxford, England, as a Rhodes scholar.
</P>
<P>
   The cloisters of Oxford took Bradley away from the fame he had
already established as an athlete and allowed him to indulge his
voracious curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as a Knick, Bradley would play with the team, but then go
off exploring by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the guys would go back to their rooms and sleep,''
recalls Dewey Schade, a friend whom Bradley visited in San Diego.
``Bill would go and meet people, take notes and talk to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Willis Reed, a Knick teammate, remembers Bradley as a team
player who avoided the limelight and showed little emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really appreciated his privacy,'' says Reed. ``We basically
didn't know what he did off season.''
</P>
<P>
   Between seasons, Bradley traveled abroad, indulging his need to
wander and be on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like he has to satisfy his father's part that is
in himself,'' says Schlant.
</P>
<P>
   During 18 years in the Senate, Bradley established himself as a
thoughtful, hard-working senator and something of a loner.
</P>
<P>
   He developed an expertise in taxes, water management and world
monetary policy, displaying both liberal and conservative bents.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was one of the strongest supporters of the earned income
tax credit for the working poor, but he also voted for many of the
Reagan budget cuts of the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He had a strong pro-labor voting record, but was one of the
leading champions of the North American Free Trade Agreement, a
position that the nation's manufacturing unions vigorously oppose.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, he helped President Reagan pass the 1986 tax bill,
which cut rates dramatically but made up the revenue by eliminating
tax loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   He also supported aid to the Nicaraguan Contras and founded an
exchange program for U.S. and Russian students.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is at once laid-back and at the same time one of the most
disciplined and structured people I've ever known,'' says former
Louisiana Sen. J. Bennett Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley developed a few close friendships in Congress, across
the political spectrum. Wellstone, perhaps the Senate's most
liberal member, admired Bradley's ``intellectual integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the gold standard,'' says Republican Jack Kemp, a former
congressman, Cabinet member and vice presidential candidate. ``I
would consider him among the finest public servants I've ever
known.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone connected with Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him to be insensitive to the needs of people who live
in small towns and rural areas,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa),
who is supporting Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley angered some Democrats when he quit the Senate in
1996 and blamed the party for contributing to public cynicism about
American politics.
</P>
<P>
   In his last term, Bradley's only child, Theresa Anne, moved from
New Jersey to live with her father in Washington and attend private
school. Bradley and Schlant agreed that one of them would be home
every night to have dinner with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget any social evenings,'' he said. ``I did my job and went
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his Senate career, Bradley grew increasingly
critical of the influence of special interests in Congress and
advocated campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he has always been an skillful fund-raiser. He
raised millions from the special interests that he condemned,
gathering a staggering $12 million for his 1990 re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley says that no one ever influenced him with money. Yet he
aggressively defended the New Jersey-based pharmaceuticals
industry, which gave him thousands in contributions.
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly fought efforts to kill a tax break for U.S.
businesses in Puerto Rico, even though it was the type of tax
loophole he decried. Half the companies benefiting were
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also fought caps on prescription drug price increases
that drug companies opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is also not above the occasional flip-flop. In the
Senate, he fought ethanol subsidies as a taxpayer giveaway. Now,
running for president in Iowa, where the corn-based fuel additive
is a sacred cow, Bradley is in favor of the subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   With the earnestness of an Eagle Scout (which he was), Bradley
defends his votes in the name of some higher good. Protecting the
tax break in Puerto Rico, he says, was about preserving Puerto
Rican jobs. Voting against ethanol was saving New Jersey taxpayers
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of protecting your state's interest, I would try to
do that from time to time,'' Bradley says.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley left the Senate in 1996 sounding as though he might
never return to politics. Describing his reasons for quitting,
Bradley said in 1995 that he had become ``disgusted with the
politics of both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked for CBS News doing weekend commentaries, taught at
Stanford University and the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1998, he phoned Dan Okimoto, his Princeton
roommate. Okimoto had spoken to him before about the White House.
This time, Okimoto said, he detected a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``He realized that he felt ready and hungry,'' said Okimoto.
``That was always one of the questions I had, which was, Did he
really want the presidency, or was he conflicted about it?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley insists he's ready for the challenge, as long as he can
run on his own terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in sequential careers,'' he jokes. ``When I'm 80,
I'm going to learn how to play the piano. When I'm 82, I'm going to
open up a piano bar. There is always something out there that you
can enjoy doing. That kind of thought has kind of kept me moving.''

 &HT;    Quiet, steady Bradley rolls like the river
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. _ Thirty-five miles south of where it joins
the Missouri River, the Mississippi churns past a tiny spit of dirt
known as Hug Farm. The river narrows here, and the current moves
swiftly, a chocolate ribbon that carves through flat farmlands and
rushes past steeply rising limestone bluffs.
</P>
<P>
   As the setting sun turned the scene here to shadows earlier this
month, two touring buses rumbled to a halt and deposited Bill
Bradley and about 50 members of the press. It was the final stop on
the ``Bill Bradley for President'' home tour, a 60-minute field
trip intended to acquaint the media with Bradley's small-town
roots.
</P>
<P>
   With reporters scribbling notes and photographers snapping away,
Bradley explained how as a teenager he would run from Crystal City
High School to the river's edge and, standing alone, inhale the
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want all of you to see the river the way I see the river,''
said Bradley, who bought Hug Farm in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But seeing the river, it turned out, wasn't all that Bradley
wanted. What attracted him to this place then and now was not the
sight of the river, but the feel of it. The quiet. The stillness.
The solitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world where there is news on the hour and there is a lot
of instant gratification, this place, this river and those bluffs
were for me a sense of permanence,'' he told the media gaggle.
``Even with this crowd, you get a sense of the solitude.''
</P>
<P>
   On one level, Bradley's river tour was scripted political
theater, portraying a contemplative man bound by birth to one of
the most potent symbols of American greatness, the mighty
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   But the vignette also revealed much about a figure who has lived
life in the public eye since the age of 14, from his basketball
glory days in Crystal City to the 16-hour days he now campaigns for
president.
</P>
<P>
   The essential truth about Bradley is that he is pulled most
strongly to the interiors of life. Introspective and at times
reserved, he covets isolation the way President Clinton craves the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to be private in order to replenish,'' says Ernestine
Schlant, a college professor _ and Emory University graduate _ whom
Bradley married in 1974. ``He almost has to go back within himself
... and then he can go out again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten months ago, Bradley entered the public spotlight once again
by becoming the only Democrat willing _ some said foolish enough _
to challenge Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1808 has a candidate successfully defeated a sitting
vice president for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, however, Bradley has obeyed an inner clock.
In 1978, he bucked the New Jersey Democratic Party by running
against the leadership's candidate in a bid for the Senate. His
only work experience was 10 years with the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Many urged him to run for president in 1988 when, four years
after a landslide re-election, he was at the peak of his
popularity. But he said he wasn't ready. He passed again in 1992,
listening to what he called an inner voice that told him the timing
was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Months after Bradley decided against a 1992 bid, his wife was
diagnosed with breast cancer. He drove her to every treatment
session. The inner voice was right.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, after briefly flirting with the idea of challenging
Clinton, possibly as an independent, Bradley instead retired from
the Senate, expressing profound disillusionment with politics and
the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's back, few question his timing anymore. Tapping
into unhappiness with the Clinton administration scandals, Bradley
is finding support among Democrats who believe Gore is too tainted.
</P>
<P>
   Next to Texas Gov. George W. Bush's sudden, early dominance,
Bradley's methodically executed campaign against Gore has so far
been the biggest surprise of the 2000 sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   With aggressive fund-raising and a message wrapped around the
American Dream, Bradley has proved that he can compete with Gore.
But there's a nagging question: Is a man who treasures solitude
ready to perform the world's most public role?
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Nelson practically tackled Bradley at a Democratic Party
barbecue near Ames, Iowa, this month. Thrusting out a copy of
Bradley's autobiography, ``Time Present, Time Past,'' Nelson said,
``I have never, ever voted for a Democrat. I am this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's encounters with voters frequently begin with an
autograph. Sometimes it is one of his books; more often it is a
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The signings hark back to Bradley's days as a basketball star
with the New York Knicks, when he helped win two NBA championships,
but they are also a testament to his continuing mystique.
</P>
<P>
   For a generation of American men, the Princeton graduate and
Rhodes scholar was proof that brains and athletic skill weren't
mutually exclusive. Consciously or unconsciously, Bradley has also
cultivated an image of integrity and independence both in
basketball and in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Rivers Blackmon, a diversity specialist from St. Louis
who met Bradley at a learning center for black children, said she
first read about him in college in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fact that he can be introspective,'' she said. ``A
lot of politicians seem to support the system instead of what is
right and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6-foot-5, Bradley towers more than most. And while he can be
professorial at times, he rarely seems to strike voters as aloof.
He succeeds, perhaps, because he talks about people, not ideology.
He tells a story about a woman he met who had no health insurance,
and another about a schoolteacher whose fourth-grade students had
no breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Such anecdotes, even if third-hand (the schoolteacher story came
from Minnesota Democrat Sen. Paul Wellstone), connect with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's the one kind of president who will really care
about people,'' said Melvin Lust, a county road worker in Newton,
Iowa. ``He's the kind of man I think we could sit down and visit
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlant, a native of Germany who teaches comparative literature
at Montclair State University in Upper Montclair, N.J., likes to
introduce her husband as the ``perfect blend'' of his schoolteacher
mother and banker father.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is indeed a product of both, but his parents'
personalities produced perhaps more tension than harmony in their
only child.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's father was a Republican in a town of Democrats, a man
who believed you made your own way in life. Warren Bradley suffered
from arthritis in his back, a condition that prevented him from
driving or even tying his own shoes.
</P>
<P>
   For all Bradley's athletic prowess, he never played any sports
with his father.
</P>
<P>
   A wealthy man who took his family to Florida in the winter,
Bradley's father was also painfully reserved. At town gatherings,
he was likely to be on the periphery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked his privacy,'' recalled neighbor Red Bryant. ``Bill's
a chip off of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's mother, Susie, was the extrovert. She was a Cub Scout
den mother and a church session leader. She organized dancing
parties for Bill's friends and pushed her son to learn the French
horn. She didn't take ``no'' for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   At Bradley's high school basketball games, she yelled at
referees over bad calls. She attended all his games and marked down
every shot that he took. The next day, he would practice the shots
he missed.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Crystal City that Bradley began to seek out places to
be alone. In addition to the river, there was the jungle gym behind
the high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a couple of occasions I would just go up there at night and
just lie on that bar and look at the stars,'' says Bradley, who
turned 56 in July. ``I learned early what you need to preserve
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The span of Bradley's life has included a number of such
timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Princeton in 1965, where he was a
three-time All-American, Bradley turned down an offer from the
Knicks and instead went to Oxford, England, as a Rhodes scholar.
</P>
<P>
   The cloisters of Oxford took Bradley away from the fame he had
already established as an athlete and allowed him to indulge his
voracious curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as a Knick, Bradley would play with the team, but then go
off exploring by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the guys would go back to their rooms and sleep,''
recalls Dewey Schade, a friend whom Bradley visited in San Diego.
``Bill would go and meet people, take notes and talk to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Willis Reed, a Knick teammate, remembers Bradley as a team
player who avoided the limelight and showed little emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really appreciated his privacy,'' says Reed. ``We basically
didn't know what he did off season.''
</P>
<P>
   Between seasons, Bradley traveled abroad, indulging his need to
wander and be on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like he has to satisfy his father's part that is
in himself,'' says Schlant.
</P>
<P>
   During 18 years in the Senate, Bradley established himself as a
thoughtful, hard-working senator and something of a loner.
</P>
<P>
   He developed an expertise in taxes, water management and world
monetary policy, displaying both liberal and conservative bents.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was one of the strongest supporters of the earned income
tax credit for the working poor, but he also voted for many of the
Reagan budget cuts of the early 1980s.

<P>
   BEIJING _ The myth of Chairman Mao is making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   With China transfixed by weeklong celebrations of the 50th
anniversary of Communist Party rule on Friday(Oct. 1), the face on
the movie poster outside the Chinese capital's biggest downtown
theater isn't Leonardo DiCaprio. Last year's heartthrob has been
replaced by a movie poster of a young and virile Mao Tse-tung.
</P>
<P>
   Mao's face will also get prime play in the next few days when
the People's Bank of China releases China's first new series of
banknotes in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gone will be the three old revolutionary comrades who used to
flank Mao on back of the 100-Yuan (US$12) banknote. From now on
Mao's picture will appear alone _ the first time a Chinese banknote
has depicted a single political figure since the People's Republic
of China proclaimed itself as a nation on October 1, 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every night, prime-time Chinese state television shows
yet another two-hour installment of a documentary on the
achievements of the communist state that emerged in 1949 after
Chairman Mao's guerrilla legions expelled the remnants of
Nationalist generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's beaten armies to the
island of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   At least 55 hours of official documentaries have aired in the
last month. While Communist Party film-makers acknowledge that Mao
committed ``errors'' through his excessive zeal for communism, they
have given Mao more propaganda credit than he has gotten in a
decade for having built China into a powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean that Mao jackets are back in fashion, or that
China is reverting to Marxism. Today's Chinese leaders are grasping
for symbols to inspire this country's 1.3 billion Chinese to keep
on striving into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Suffering unemployment, angered by official corruption and
finding little solace in outmoded Marxist ideology, the Party
realizes that hundreds of millions of Chinese are looking for
something to believe in.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, Mao's reputation seemed caught in a terminal
tailspin among the official Communist Party historians.
</P>
<P>
   Year-by-year in the mid-1990s, Mao's name was mentioned less
often by the state-run Xinhua news agency. There were even a few
suggestions in China's controlled press that Mao's corpse should be
removed from its marble mausoleum in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   But now in the run-up to the 50th anniversary, some Beijing
intellectuals are dismayed that the Party's message on Mao seems to
have reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear that the authorities in the current government are
trying to re-emphasize the role played by Mao Tse-tung,'' said
economic consultant Mao Yushi, chairman of the non-governmental
Unirule Institute of Economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask intellectuals, I believe more than 90 percent hold
a view very strong against Mao Tse-tung,'' said the consultant Mao
(no relation to the late Chairman). ``But if you ask the average
worker or rural people, I would say 50 percent or more still
respect Mao as a great man.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   As the 50th anniversary approaches, China's party historians are
churning out new tomes of official history that not only recite
Mao's achievements but also lay out the latest approved versions of
where ``The Great Helmsman'' went wrong. Some of it is hard-hitting
stuff, compared with the more benign image of Mao conveyed in
official television documentaries
</P>
<P>
   and other mass media.
</P>
<P>
   One two-volume historical opus, marked for the attention of
communist party cadres, turned up this month in a bookstore open to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   Authored by a party committee at the Learned Institute on the
History of the People's Republic of China, the book accused Mao of
having started the ``chaos'' of the 1966-76 Great Proletarian
Cultural Revolution through ``incorrect understanding'' of China's
political situation.
</P>
<P>
   Another new officially sanctioned book blames Mao's
``over-enthusiasm'' for causing the tragic 1958 ``Great Leap
Forward,'' a rural industrialization scheme that ultimately started
a famine which killed an estimated 30 million people. Mao's role in
causing the famine was not mentioned, nor was the toll of the food
shortage.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   One way to gauge how Mao rates these days in party propaganda is
to visit a grandiose exhibit now underway in the Beijing Exhibition
Center. Organized by a consortium of Chinese ministries, provincial
governments, the military and the Communist Party, the show is
entitled ``Glorious Course _ Exhibition of Achievements of the 50th
Anniversary of the People's Republic of China.''
</P>
<P>
   An unofficial count puts the number of photos of Mao in the
exhibit at 102, compared to only 68 for the late leader Deng
Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
   Only one Chinese leader commands as much space in the 50-year
``Glorious Course'' exhibit as Mao. That is incumbent President
Jiang Zemin, whose exploits during his relatively colorless decade
as Communist Party chief are recorded in 106 photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Mao is shown as transcending the movie poster-version of the
virile Chinese guerrilla fighter thrashing bourgeois reactionaries
and knocking the foreign devils on their ears. As depicted by the
``Glorious Course'' exhibit, Mao is also a nation-builder, a
delight for awe-struck Chinese children, a spearhead of Chinese
education, an inspiration for rocket scientists and a creator of
steel mills.
</P>
<P>
   Mao hasn't built China all on his own, of course. As the
exhibit's designers explained in a press conference, ``Glorious
Course'' is designed to let people cherish the memory of China's
accomplishments under ``three generations of collective
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Mao and his ``proletarian revolutionaries'' came first and got
China started on a path toward rapid economic growth. Following
Mao's death in 1976 at the age of 83, China was led by a ``second
generation'' under Deng that turned China on a course toward
prosperity through market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Following Mao and Deng, the exhibit gives the party's formal
imprimatur to the emergence of a new and equally important ``third
generation'' of collective leadership, this one headed by President
Jiang Zemin. Although Jiang achieved full power only after Deng's
death in 1997, now he is being put forward as a historical figure
of supreme importance.
</P>
<P>
   The job of Jiang's generation is to ``compose more glorious
historical pages of the basic realization of socialist
modernization by the middle of the next century,'' says Wang
Chunzheng, one of the chiefs of the ``leading team'' that assembled
the exhibit.

<P>
   BEIJING _ The myth of Chairman Mao is making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   With China transfixed by weeklong celebrations of the 50th
anniversary of Communist Party rule on Friday(Oct. 1), the face on
the movie poster outside the Chinese capital's biggest downtown
theater isn't Leonardo DiCaprio. Last year's heartthrob has been
replaced by a movie poster of a young and virile Mao Tse-tung.
</P>
<P>
   Mao's face will also get prime play in the next few days when
the People's Bank of China releases China's first new series of
banknotes in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gone will be the three old revolutionary comrades who used to
flank Mao on back of the 100-Yuan (US$12) banknote. From now on
Mao's picture will appear alone _ the first time a Chinese banknote
has depicted a single political figure since the People's Republic
of China proclaimed itself as a nation on October 1, 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every night, prime-time Chinese state television shows
yet another two-hour installment of a documentary on the
achievements of the communist state that emerged in 1949 after
Chairman Mao's guerrilla legions expelled the remnants of
Nationalist generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's beaten armies to the
island of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   At least 55 hours of official documentaries have aired in the
last month. While Communist Party film-makers acknowledge that Mao
committed ``errors'' through his excessive zeal for communism, they
have given Mao more propaganda credit than he has gotten in a
decade for having built China into a powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean that Mao jackets are back in fashion, or that
China is reverting to Marxism. Today's Chinese leaders are grasping
for symbols to inspire this country's 1.3 billion Chinese to keep
on striving into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Suffering unemployment, angered by official corruption and
finding little solace in outmoded Marxist ideology, the Party
realizes that hundreds of millions of Chinese are looking for
something to believe in.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, Mao's reputation seemed caught in a terminal
tailspin among the official Communist Party historians.
</P>
<P>
   Year-by-year in the mid-1990s, Mao's name was mentioned less
often by the state-run Xinhua news agency. There were even a few
suggestions in China's controlled press that Mao's corpse should be
removed from its marble mausoleum in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   But now in the run-up to the 50th anniversary, some Beijing
intellectuals are dismayed that the Party's message on Mao seems to
have reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear that the authorities in the current government are
trying to re-emphasize the role played by Mao Tse-tung,'' said
economic consultant Mao Yushi, chairman of the non-governmental
Unirule Institute of Economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask intellectuals, I believe more than 90 percent hold
a view very strong against Mao Tse-tung,'' said the consultant Mao
(no relation to the late Chairman). ``But if you ask the average
worker or rural people, I would say 50 percent or more still
respect Mao as a great man.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   As the 50th anniversary approaches, China's party historians are
churning out new tomes of official history that not only recite
Mao's achievements but also lay out the latest approved versions of
where ``The Great Helmsman'' went wrong. Some of it is hard-hitting
stuff, compared with the more benign image of Mao conveyed in
official television documentaries
</P>
<P>
   and other mass media.
</P>
<P>
   One two-volume historical opus, marked for the attention of
communist party cadres, turned up this month in a bookstore open to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   Authored by a party committee at the Learned Institute on the
History of the People's Republic of China, the book accused Mao of
having started the ``chaos'' of the 1966-76 Great Proletarian
Cultural Revolution through ``incorrect understanding'' of China's
political situation.
</P>
<P>
   Another new officially sanctioned book blames Mao's
``over-enthusiasm'' for causing the tragic 1958 ``Great Leap
Forward,'' a rural industrialization scheme that ultimately started
a famine which killed an estimated 30 million people. Mao's role in
causing the famine was not mentioned, nor was the toll of the food
shortage.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   One way to gauge how Mao rates these days in party propaganda is
to visit a grandiose exhibit now underway in the Beijing Exhibition
Center. Organized by a consortium of Chinese ministries, provincial
governments, the military and the Communist Party, the show is
entitled ``Glorious Course _ Exhibition of Achievements of the 50th
Anniversary of the People's Republic of China.''
</P>
<P>
   An unofficial count puts the number of photos of Mao in the
exhibit at 102, compared to only 68 for the late leader Deng
Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
   Only one Chinese leader commands as much space in the 50-year
``Glorious Course'' exhibit as Mao. That is incumbent President
Jiang Zemin, whose exploits during his relatively colorless decade
as Communist Party chief are recorded in 106 photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Mao is shown as transcending the movie poster-version of the
virile Chinese guerrilla fighter thrashing bourgeois reactionaries
and knocking the foreign devils on their ears. As depicted by the
``Glorious Course'' exhibit, Mao is also a nation-builder, a
delight for awe-struck Chinese children, a spearhead of Chinese
education, an inspiration for rocket scientists and a creator of
steel mills.
</P>
<P>
   Mao hasn't built China all on his own, of course. As the
exhibit's designers explained in a press conference, ``Glorious

accomplishments under ``three generations of collective
leadership.''
</P>
<P>

Mao's death in 1976 at the age of 83, China was led by a ``second

prosperity through market reforms.

modernization by the middle of the next century,'' says Wang
Chunzheng, one of the chiefs of the ``leading team'' that assembled

   RAIL: A Jackson County jury today will hear arguments for
punitive damages, following Monday's $40 million award to Sedalia
woman seriously injured at a dangerous rail crossing near
Warrensburg. Union Pacific Railroad and Amtrak were the defendants.
Eleven months before the accident, the state found the view at the
crossing was 90 percent obstructed with no lights or gates and
trains racing by at 70 mph. Story also will address the complicated
way railroads and government address crossings and will get
industry reaction to any punitive verdict. Joe Lambe and Matt
Campbell. 25.

   FOOD-BBQ-KANSAS (Kansas City, Mo.) _ Ardie Davis has been
hitting the barbecue sauce pretty hard.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is he has probably drunk a swimming pool's worth of the
stuff over the years yet still always manages to keep enough sauce
on hand to fill up a good-sized bath tub.
</P>
<P>
   While working on The Great BBQ Sauce Book (Ten Speed Press,
$15.95), Davis was on a first-name basis with the UPS driver who
dropped off ``hundreds'' of long-neck bottles, funky flasks, clunky
moonshine jugs and mayonnaise jars containing the condiment on the
doorstep of his Roeland Park, Kan., home. 1150 words. By JILL
WENDHOLT SILVA.
</P>
<P>
   CD-9INCH-KANSAS (undated) _ It's been five years since Nine Inch
Nails' ``The Downward Spiral'' established its mastermind, Trent
Reznor, as the poster boy for malicious electronic rock.
</P>
<P>
   That album's death-disco hit, ``Closer,'' with its unprintable
catch phrase and creepy video, was a remarkably dark point in the
already gloomy grunge scene, and it made a star out of its creator.
</P>
<P>
   Reznor finally has re-emerged with his third album, ``The
Fragile,'' a double disc that explores many of the same emotional
depths as its predecessors, but with a more refined sense of
modulation and restraint. It's a quixotic, challenging work that
cements Reznor's reputation for sound and fury, yet also gives
voice to a softer, more nuanced side of NIN. 500 words. By DEREK
DONOVAN.
</P>
<P>
   TV-TOOYOUNG-KANSAS (Pacific Palisades, Calif.) _ It's another
pristine day at Jacqueline Kennedy High School in Southern
California, just a mile up the hill from Pacific Coast Highway. Out
on the large, oval-shaped quad, kids are tossing a football, eating
at the outdoor cafeteria, looking out from a second-story railing
toward the ocean. Here, 20-something actors pretend to be teens for
a show that a bunch of 40-something TV executives hope will draw an
audience of 12- to 34-year-olds. That's show business!
</P>
<P>
   There are eight new shows that fit that exact MO. Add in the
ones that reverse the premise _ shows about 20-somethings that
teen-agers will want to watch _ and you're easily talking a third,
if not one-half, of the new kids on the TV block. 950 words. By

GIULIANI'S ART CRITICISM IS ON THE MARK 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ I don't know about you, but I have problems
accepting as an art critic a guy who prances across my television
screen on ``Saturday Night Live'' wearing a Marilyn Monroe wig,
high heels, lipstick, fake eyelashes and falsies.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani (the man who once
dressed in drag for ``SNL'') seems to have a point here. The issue
is an exhibition planned for the Brooklyn Museum of Art. This show
has been in the works for months, but the mayor's two
representatives on the museum board apparently failed to alert him
before he blew a gasket last week over its content.
</P>
<P>
   It's an exhibit entitled ``Sensation: Young British Artists from
the Saatchi Collection.'' That's precisely what it has become _ a
sensation _ largely because of one piece.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a work by the London artist Chris Ofili called ``The
Holy Virgin Mary.'' I've seen only a small, printed, color image of
it, but it looks like no other representation of the Virgin Mary
that I've seen.
</P>
<P>
   The work's most disturbing components are about 120 photos of
bare female behinds and lacquered clumps of elephant manure
adorning the image. Whatever point the artist is trying to make
seems obscure, but he has a definite thing for elephant manure.
Some people use it for gardening; Ofili uses it for most of his
works of, ahem, art.
</P>
<P>
   This exhibit attracted a surging mob of people when it went on
display in London two years ago. About 300,000 art lovers trekked
through it. It's partly funded by an art collector and businessman
named Charles Saatchi, who wants to use representations of these
works to decorate a new chain of restaurants called Sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is unimpressed with most of the other works in the
exhibit, which apparently consists largely of the sort of oddball,
avant-garde self-indulgences that pass for visual art in hopelessly
hip circles. But he's so openly furious over the ``Holy Virgin
Mary'' that he's threatening to withhold millions in city money
from the museum and to throw it out of the city-owned building it
occupies.
</P>
<P>
   This position has touched off the usual howl from extreme civil
libertarians who (1) despise Giuliani just on general principles
and (2) cling to the conviction that artists should enjoy
unfettered access to public funds even when their art deeply
offends the people who pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can seriously imagine the American Civil Liberties Union
arguing against mayoral outrage over artwork glorifying Nazi
principles or denigrating Jews, African-Americans, Latinos or gays.
If the mayor ranted about public funds going to display stuff that
trashed what are thought of as oppressed groups, my guess is that
the civil libertarians would sit mute.
</P>
<P>
   But art insulting to Christian believers, especially Catholics,
who hold a special reverence for the Virgin Mary? That's fine. A
strong strain of anti-Catholicism runs through the self-styled
intelligentsia. It's that abortion business, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   A vast difference exists between a public official with police
powers proclaiming that art can't be displayed privately and a
public official saying ``Not on public property with the tax
dollars entrusted to my care.'' The first is censorship. The second
might well be politics _ Giuliani is considering a run for the U.S.
Senate, after all _ but it also can be legitimate public policy.
The museum gets public money to present ``art for all.'' That's
what it proclaims on the banner across the building's face.
</P>
<P>
   From all reports, the ``Holy Virgin Mary'' is not an work you
would want to show the kiddies. And it would bring bitter, just
tears to the eyes of your sweet old Aunt Mary Ellen, the nun.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the First Amendment doesn't require public funding
to display art that directly diminishes anybody's religious faith.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is right on this one.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary General Kofi Annan's plea last week
for the world to help bring peace to forgotten corners of Africa
appears headed for a test as early as Tuesday with a plan to send
6,000 peacekeepers to Sierra Leone, a place scarred by a new horror
of war, mass amputations.
</P>
<P>
   And looming ahead for the UN Security Council may be a second
test, a proposal to send an astoundingly large force of 15,000 to
20,000 troops to broker a shaky peace in the Democratic Republic of
Congo, which until recently was a battlefield in which nine
separate nations or rebel forces had squared off.
</P>
<P>
   The UN peacekeeping force now numbers 13,335 troops, and the two
plans proposed for the African nations could nearly triple the size
of the force.
</P>
<P>
   Debates on these two plans _ at the same time the UN is gearing
up to administer Kosovo and East Timor, as well as possible peace
efforts in Angola and along the Eritrea-Ethiopia border _ would
help determine the outcome of wars for years to come. It may signal
whether the United Nations will become a central mediator or a
ceremonial bystander. It could clarify whether the United States,
the world's sole superpower, might be stuck as its supercop as
well.
</P>
<P>
   And, the UN debate would give Africa a fresh answer about the
depth of the commitment of the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   After Annan's dramatic appeal, President Clinton called on
nations to take a ``shared responsibility'' to end warfare because,
he said, America could not intervene everywhere. But he kept the
door slightly ajar, saying no country should be ``indifferent to
the destruction of innocents in any part of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan's speech, which kicked off the 54th General Assembly, grew
out of broadly felt frustrations from around the world since the
1994 genocide in Rwanda that UN and US responses were far quicker
to white people's wars and far slower to battles involving people
of color. For weeks in 1994, the United States blocked UN action in
Rwanda, where more than a half-million people were slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary general envisioned a new world order that put the
UN Security Council as the chief arbiter of disputes; nations
assuming more of an international conscience rather than strictly
following their own strategic interests; and borders offering no
defense for states that commit atrocities against its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   He had barely finished speaking from the dais before others
began the debate. Some Western leaders applauded Annan. China,
Russia and some African leaders were sharply critical, saying it
smacked of colonialism and hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's speech raised more questions than answers: Who will pay?
Is the United Nations capable of dramatically expanding
peacekeeping operations? How long should the operations last?
Should peacekeepers be given liberal rules of self-defense? Should
future UN missions take on more tasks?
</P>
<P>
   ``The world doesn't change 180 degrees overnight,'' Edward
Mortimer, Annan's chief speechwriter, said in an interview. ``The
secretary general is trying to capture a direction for change. . .
. There has to be a degree of consistency about it. If you are
prepared to pull out all the stops in Kosovo and Haiti, and you do
nothing for people in Africa, it takes the edge off of the
moralistic gloss you are are putting on your actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The test on Africa also depends on African nations, of course.
No proposal for peacekeepers in the Congo, the former Zaire, will
go forward until all the nations involved in that war give security
guarantees. And no UN force will go into Angola or the
Eritrea-Ethiopia border until there is a declared peace.
</P>
<P>
   The nerve center for peacekeeping operations is tucked into the
southeastern corner of the 32rd floor at UN headquarters. There, in
the Situation Center, intelligence specialists track what may be
the world body's most dangerous assignments.
</P>
<P>
   They conduct live video conferences on split TV screens, talk on
secure phones tucked inside briefcases, and send and receive coded
cables in the 24-hour-a-day Duty Room. After the Kosovo war, for
instance, supervisors held almost daily discussions beamed onto
their TV sets, often from Geneva, Rome, and Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations sent its first peacekeeping force to
Jerusalem in June 1948 in the midst of the Arab-Israeli war. The
United Nations Truce Supervision Organization is still there,
although its mission is far different. Now it supports UN forces in
the Golan Heights and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In the 51 years since, the Security Council has authorized 49
peacekeeping operations, 36 of them in the last 11 years. Wearing
UN blue helmets or berets, usually only lightly armed for
self-defense, peacekeepers have become far more than just a wall
between combatants. Now they are police officers, civilian
administrations, and election observers, among other things. During
an upswing in activity in 1993, the missions included 70,000
peacekeepers, at a cost of $4 billion. Current operations cost
slightly under $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   There have been many successes, including 1988, when UN
peacekeeping operations were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. But
recent failures also loom large, including missions to Somalia and
Bosnia in which scores of peacekeepers were killed or injured.
Critics say the Security Council failed to give those peacekeepers
adequate rules of engagement, or even funds.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is last year's UN retreat from Angola. Alex
Vines, who wrote a scathing review of UN operations in Angola for
Human Rights Watch, said UN observers lost credibility there
because they refused to apportion blame for past abuses. ``The core
problem really in Angola was a lack of political will. They didn't
want to rock the boat,'' said Vines in a telephone interview from
London. ``The UN was regarded with disdain there. It turned out to
be a paper tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest problem for future UN peacekeeping missions
isn't likely to be past critiques.
</P>
<P>
   Money's the trouble. Finding enough troops also could be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we are going to have a UN capable of operating
globally with all the international conflicts that we will see in
the future,'' said Richard H. Shultz, a national security
specialist at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts
University. ``They don't have the resources and capability.''
</P>
<P>
   Shultz also said that the Clinton administration will be
reluctant to commit many resources to missions in Africa in part
because deployments in Bosnia and Kosovo are likely to last years
and cost billions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the president and you're going to contribute 5,000
troops to the Congo? I don't think so,'' Shultz said. ``This is
where Kofi Annan is going to have his problems.''
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council, said
Africa remains a ``key priority'' for Clinton, but said the
president has not made any decisions about sending US peacekeepers
to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the US has 376 people on UN missions, ranking No. 14
in the world. Only five of them are soldiers; most are police
officers. The United States, the largest contributor to UN
peacekeeping, lags far behind in its contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, it has paid $50 million toward a $570
million assessment. That is part of US arrears to the United
Nations, which total more than $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to make a decision on future US deployment based on
our interests, capability, and our resources,'' Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer, Annan's speechwriter, said nations will closely watch
the US role in future missions.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about US reluctance to commit troops, he said, ``We have
to be a bit careful. I'm sure no American would want to imply that
it doesn't matter a how many Africans or Yugoslavs . . . are
killed, as long as no American peacekeepers are killed.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There must be many interesting things about the
marbled murrelet and the spotted owl, but I don't give a hoot what
they are. Both have feathers. Both fly. Both may have descended
from dinosaurs. That's all I need to know.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the famous real estate in Northern California
that these little guys inhabit _ the 7,500-acre Headwaters Grove in
Humboldt County _ interests me a lot. And I am very glad Tom Reid
of Palo Alto helped to save it for future generations.
</P>
<P>
   You thought the Headwaters redwoods were saved by Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., who got their owner, the Pacific Lumber Co.,
to accept $480 million to sell the grove, to limit logging on about
200,000 additional acres and to agree to eventually sell other
stands of old-growth redwood.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was a bunch of people behind the scenes, including
Stanford-trained biologist Reid, a trekker in cyberspace who has
made a career of saving open space while sitting at his desk.
</P>
<P>
   A month or so after Feinstein and Pacific Lumber announced that
they had reached a deal _ albeit a very fragile one _ Pacific
Lumber expressed grave reservations, stopping the hearts of tree
huggers.
</P>
<P>
   Just as suddenly, however, the company dropped its objections,
bowing to the scientific arguments made by Reid and a handful of
government biologists. The drudges put the Headwaters over the top
by virtue of their unflagging advocacy of solid scientific facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the credibility of what I'm telling people that does my
job,'' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   For fees of up to $135 per hour, Reid, 51, and his 12-person
staff do something few others do. They quantify the components of
land deals involving potentially conflicting commercial and
environmental components, some of which would appear to be very
unquantifiable _ bird nesting sites, coho salmon, hydraulic flows,
butterflies and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Reid's clients typically are governmental agencies. In the
Headwaters deal, it was the state Resources Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Using computers and ``geographic information system'' software _
a sophisticated program originally developed for the oil and mining
industries _ Reid is able to take mountains of information and make
it all mesh.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the information is gathered by satellites, which today
are capable of counting the number of trees and determining their
heights in areas as small as 100 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   This means that it is now possible to play chess with different
pieces of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the conservation plans I've worked on,'' Reid said,
``break down to measuring the value of something, in dollars or
birds or acres of rare plants. If you can't measure the value of
what you're trying to maintain, you can't evaluate the
alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Reid, the problem with the Headwaters was that
Feinstein and Pacific Lumber boss Charles Hurwitz had agreed to the
boundaries of the land under negotiation, then directed others to
work out the details within a limited time frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``No disrespect to Senator Feinstein,'' Reid said, ``but from a
practical point of view, that was impossible. It didn't take a
rocket scientist to know we weren't going to be able to do it in
the time frame allowed, but nobody was willing to acknowledge this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Headwaters was only 7,500 acres and Pacific Lumber owned
roughly 210,000 acres, so there was no deal _ nothing at all _ for
most of its property.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there was no progress because the agencies involved had no
way to know the extent of the resources under planning. They didn't
have a map and the Pacific Lumber Company saw no purpose in
providing one.
</P>
<P>
   ``So there was no movement, because there was no way to see what
was in between the two positions _ the government saying you can't
cut anything and Pacific Lumber saying we can cut everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid and his biologist colleagues in government broke through
the impasse, enabling a final deal to be reached in March, by
providing concrete information _ often in the form of computerized
maps _ both sides could readily accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't at the negotiating table,'' he told the New York
Times, ``but we helped build the table back in the shop so that
others could negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   John Muir, I'm sure, is smiling.

THE HOLE STORY IS WORTH STICKING TO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Listeners tuned in to the golf chat Thursday on WBUR's ``The
Connection'' heard guest Bob Bubka offer this tidbit: ``There've
been four hole in ones in Ryder Cup history.'' For a golf innocent,
though, the hook was not the number but the plural: Shouldn't it be
holes in one? Or did Bubka, author of ``The Ryder Cup: Golf's
Greatest Event,'' know best?
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago, we explored a similar question in this
space. Reader Mary Anne McQuillan objected to the plural
sticks-in-the-mud, and I agreed that as a ``headless'' compound _
neither a kind of stick nor a kind of mud _ the word should take
the plural stick-in-the-muds.
</P>
<P>
   This judgment didn't persuade everyone. David Chang of Newton,
in a thoughtful letter on the problems of plurals, noted that his
Random House Handbook calls for pluralizing the ``significant''
word in a compound. ``Who's to say that sticks are more significant
than mud?'' Chang asked.
</P>
<P>
   But that challenge misses the point: Stick-in-the-mud derives
from the verbal phrase to stick in the mud (or, in some obsolete
variants, in clay or briers or mire), not from the noun stick.
There is no stick in stick-in-the-mud, so it has put its -s at the
end.
</P>
<P>
   Reader David Tuggy argues for sticks-in-the-mud on different
grounds. As a connoisseur of odd combinations _ ``not my bag of
tea,'' for instance _ he's happy to let a word be read two ways, as
long as communication isn't hampered. The dual meaning even
enriches the language, he says, giving such words a
``three-dimensional beauty'' that prescriptive rigidity kills.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, for once, I'm in the conservative camp.
Stick-in-the-muds reflects the real meaning of the compound; if you
understand it, you'll no more say sticks-in-the-mud than you would
call lazy kids goofs-off or your ignorant cousins knows-nothing.
It's easy to see stick as a noun, since we don't often see the verb
in such constructions _ though you probably remember Elvis singing
``I'm gonna stick like glue.'' But if the compound had been adopted
with a different form of the verb _ stuck-in-the-mud, say _ no one
would pluralize it as stucks-in-the-mud.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, stick-in-the-muds is the official plural, when
dictionary makers think to give it. True, its original meaning may
vanish, or it may have to coexist with the new one, just as ``to
the manor born'' has an independent life even though it's not what
Shakespeare wrote. But to anyone attuned to the original meaning,
the variants sound wrong, for now.
</P>
<P>
   On the hole in one question, though, there's room to maneuver.
It could come from the verb to hole (to hole out, to hole in one);
but the holes had to be there (as the noun was) before the golfing
verb could be coined. So either derivation is plausible, and either
plural defensible.
</P>
<P>
   If you suspect that hole in one descends from he holed in one,
you're with Bob Bubka: Your plural is hole in ones. If you prefer
the noun ancestry, holes in one makes more sense, since holes is
the ``significant'' word. This is the form chosen by the new
edition of the Concise Oxford Dictionary (and by the Globe). But
other dictionaries don't list a plural, suggesting the default
option, hole in ones, is right.
</P>
<P>
   So when you're pluralizing on the links, have it your way. But
when it comes to stick-in-the-muds, I've got my story and I'm
sticking to it.

TV NEEDS MORE THAN MINORITY ACTORS

<TEXT>
<P>
   PIEDMONT, Calif. _ A few years back, Asian-Americans were
excited that a new television comedy featured mostly Asian-American
actors. Called ``All American Girl,'' it starred Margaret Cho, who
began her show business career in San Francisco as a standup comic.
</P>
<P>
   The show lasted one season, and I wasn't sorry to see it
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Some Asian-American friends disagreed with me, saying it was
important to support a show that had Asian-American actors in lead
roles.
</P>
<P>
   I was indifferent to ``All American Girl'' mainly because it was
artistically fraudulent. Its actors may have had Asian features,
but the show's sensibilities were more Borscht Belt than Koreatown
(Cho being a Korean-American). That show reflected its creators,
who were white.
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem with the quick-fix now of inserting minority
faces to satisfy complaints by the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People and others.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't true diversity. True diversity would explore all
sorts of stories from America's rich mixture of ethnicities and
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   As the fall TV season began, a coalition of minority groups
called for viewers to stop watching the four major networks during
prime time hours for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   I'm usually sympathetic to such groups, but on this one, I'm not
listening. It's not that I don't believe in the goal _ to draw
attention to the fact that most prime time shows don't have
meaningful roles for minority actors. But a brief boycott won't
teach network executives any lasting lessons. Besides, the networks
are losing viewers to cable and other mass media anyway. Even
without a boycott, TV producers are scrambling like mad to add some
color to their casts at the last minute, primarily because the
NAACP (which isn't leading the boycott) has been complaining about
a lack of diversity in TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   The networks' too-little, too-late response is laughable and
insulting. If nothing else, this cultural contretemps shows that
the NAACP still wields clout with the white-run TV entertainment
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Something is missing, however, from the public discussions about
the lack of diversity on TV. Boiled down, the issue seems to be one
of jobs _ which performers get the lead and supporting parts on
shows that can generate enormous wealth and fame for those
fortunate enough to be chosen. That's terrific for the men and
women who survive the famously backstabbing world of show business.
But is fame and fortune all there is for the few black, Latino and
Asian actors who perpetuate tokenism? In our celebrity worshipping
society, what else is there?
</P>
<P>
   We're talking TV here. TV is both an entertainment and a
commercial medium. On rare occasions, it can elevate our spirits
and well-being, but mostly it dulls our senses and reinforces
stereotypes _ sometimes with a few laughs.
</P>
<P>
   One reason I am not boycotting the new season is because TV
shows are temporary diversions from work and parenting
responsibilities. I like some TV dramas, even ones that don't have
minority actors. Sure, I'd like to see more shows with greater
casting diversity, especially Asian-American faces. But that's a
pretty low threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Bochco, the successful producer of TV hits like ``NYPD
Blue,'' has said, ``I don't think there's conscious prejudice on
television. ... It's unthinking. It tends to be an unmindful
reflection of self on the part of writers and developers and
networks in general.''
</P>
<P>
   The powers behind the scenes of the TV entertainment industry
are overwhelmingly white men, so all they are doing is ``reflecting
self.''
</P>
<P>
   True diversity won't be accomplished until the writers,
producers and executives look more like the real America, not the
fake one now being depicted on the four major networks.

WHAT GORE AND BRADLEY ARE LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; -- In a sentence, Bill Bradley's clarion call went
like this: ``What we need is a little plain speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a sentence, Al Gore got to his point this way: ``I want
to be your nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, neither man's pitch is going to produce the
Democratic nomination for president next year. But their first
joint appearance on a stage before an obviously Gore-biased
Democratic National Committee, assorted hangers-on, and imported
cheerleaders over the weekend was interesting for the effect each
had on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Again, in a sentence, each man was very impressed with the
other, enough to kindle the respect-based fears that dwell in each
camp, whose high commands stopped spinning and schmoozing long
enough to listen carefully.
</P>
<P>
   To the vice president's inner circle, Bradley exudes
authenticity, the power of which is enhanced by his engaging
awkwardness and conversational tone. Audiences don't cheer, they
shut up and listen, and respond to his seriousness and respect for
their intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   As one Gore adviser told me, the fear is that Bradley has caught
a different wave in politics _ one that carries a candidate on the
simple strength of his persona and values, overwhelming agenda, and
record. The Bradley supporter may not particularly worry, for
example, about the details of the former New Jersey senator's
position on health care that he is unveiling in California this
week; he is content to respond to Bradley's obvious determination
to face the complicated question squarely and diligently.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bradley camp's concerns are just as substantial. Unlike
most of political Washington, where analysis hides behind the
latest polls, Gore is not seen as a stick figure. He is a
formidable person who has figured out how to present a program of
next steps that build on Clinton administration policies that the
public strongly supports and believes have made a big difference.
One Bradley adviser confided that the ``Clinton fatigue'' that is
all the polling rage around here is a simplistic, short-term
phenomenon that Gore is capable of overcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Think of Bradley and Gore as parallel tracks. Each has its own
characteristics, and in the end you simply choose one. The clash
that political junkies always lust for will not illuminate the
choice. My hunch is that whoever starts one will pay a steep price,
and should. Over the weekend, it was obvious how Bradley and Gore
are mostly staying far away from each other. The lone exceptions
were revealing.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's was a one-sentence pledge never to support vouchers for
public school families to take to private schools, carrying the
implicit reminder that Bradley had voted in the Senate for tests of
the concept and spoken favorably of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's, typically, was subtle _ a slight dig at the party's
new chairman and old Gore buddy, Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed Rendell has assured me that things will be fair,'' Bradley
said. ``I think that's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Big deal. More revealing was the fact that neither camp used any
of the silly things it has in the recent past. Bradley, for
example, has on occasion claimed that his privileged background as
a small-town Missouri banker's son was more ``normal'' than Gore's
privileged background as a senator's son. This is when appealing
authenticity becomes self-indulgent superiority. In politics, every
saint risks the inevitable exposure as sinner.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign must fight the temptation to attack. It looked
particularly thuggish when chairman Tony Coelho slammed Bradley for
his offer to forgo unlimited ``soft money'' contributions in a
wished-for general election if the Republican nominee agrees (which
John McCain already has). Normal weakness and strength aside, any
suggestion that Bradley is disqualified on his record or ideas is
preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   But it is no accident that Bradley is spending this week
unveiling a detailed set of ideas about health care, as Gore did in
early September; no accident either that in three weeks he'll do
the same on poverty in New York City. At some point soon, being a
relatively fresher face and riding ``Clinton fatigue'' runs out of
gas. It either makes a substantive difference that Bradley wins the
nomination or it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   It's also no accident that more of Gore is emerging as he
campaigns in the early voting states. The superficial trappings
like entering from the back of the hall to ``Love Train'' (shades
of Mike Dukakis) and pacing the stage with a wireless microphone on
his tie (shades of Elizabeth Dole) won't matter much.
</P>
<P>
   What does is narrative like Gore's tale here of his post-college
disillusionment with politics after the defeat of his principled
father in 1970; his Army tour in Vietnam; his return to Watergate
America; and his reawakened sense of purpose as a writer on The
Nashville Tennessean. This is not Bradley versus Gore. It's Bradley
or Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley needs to show he can do politics the way he played
basketball, willing to skin his knees diving for loose balls. Gore
needs to show he can lead as well as take positions, so people will
want to follow him and not merely endorse him.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it's enough that each has impressed the other.

GETTING THAT NUMB FEELING FROM THE TV NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK BRANSFIELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CULVER CITY, Calif. _ I was not moved by the earthquakes in
Taiwan or in Turkey. (No pun intended.) Nor was I moved by the JFK
Jr. tragedy. Or even the Columbine massacre.
</P>
<P>
   How could I be? I am a product of this TV News Media Run Amok
Age. I cannot care anymore. I have been corrupted.
</P>
<P>
   News cameras brought the horrors of Vietnam into our living
rooms. It was world-class tragedy, up close and personal, for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, similar horrors are brought into our bedrooms, because
what I feel is akin to molestation. As a result, I now suffer from
a chronic condition known as ATD: Acute Televisual Desensitization.
</P>
<P>
   I would hazard a guess that long, long ago (maybe pre-1960s), in
a galaxy not-so-far away, most tragedies would simply occur. They
would occur and then almost everything about that tragedy would be
dealt with locally, on what used to be known as a human scale.
</P>
<P>
   The dead would be mourned by those who knew them, one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there were world wars, calamities and individual dramas
that were written about in the newspapers. But events read about
are different. When reading, one relies on the imagination to form
a mental picture.
</P>
<P>
   When everything _ and I mean everything _ is shown with every
sight and sound intact, the images should affect us even more.
</P>
<P>
   But the everyday horrific news images no longer affect us
because we are inundated with similar pictures day in and day out.
</P>
<P>
   Think Mark Barton, who opened fire on fellow stock traders in
Atlanta; the church shootings in Fort Worth, Texas; ad infinitum,
ad nauseam. The shocking and the sad has been reduced to cheap,
voyeuristic thrills.
</P>
<P>
   How is the average person supposed to deal with endless violent
tragedy on the news nearly every day?
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about ``A car chase ends in a gruesome inferno. More
at 11.'' I'm talking about ``A man jumps to his watery death. See
it at 6.'' And, ``An angry husband shoots his wife and three kids,
then himself. More after this commercial break.''
</P>
<P>
   In my dictionary, news is defined as ``new information.'' Tell
me, what's new about yet another disastrous fire, car crash or
murder? What purpose does this information really serve, besides
ratings?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I am supposed to feel better about my own problems because
at least I wasn't mauled by the neighbor's pit bull.
</P>
<P>
   I have a confession to make. I was very moved by the death of
John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her sister in an airplane
accident. I was also extremely moved by the shooting deaths at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. But after dozens of news
shows and specials with different catchy titles (``Slaughter in the
Schoolyard''), how can one be anything other than annoyed and
repulsed by the crass, overdone coverage?
</P>
<P>
   I would have been very moved by the earthquake disaster in
Turkey too, but the truth is that I am afraid to turn on the news
anymore. I am tired of caring about other human beings via my
remote control. Getting choked up in my living room doesn't do much
good for anybody.
</P>
<P>
   I may feel compassion, but it is a distant and impotent
compassion. I am still a voyeur. At best, I am a compassionate
voyeur.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I mail a check to the Red Cross when a disaster strikes. I
pray for the victims. I try in some way to learn from these awful
events, to somehow be at least a more aware person.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly these televisual tragedies pile up like so many car
wrecks, and I am left uncomfortably numb.

   Finding accommodations during the millennium celebration can be
difficult. One solution is to seek out villas, condos, or private
homes. On St. Barthelemy, the small Caribbean isle, rates at hotels
for the celebration have been doubled in many cases. However, St.
Barth Properties (800-421-3396) reports there are properties where
prices have increased only slightly. The Franklin, Mass., firm
specializes in villa vacations on St. Barts and offers a villa and
hotel ``Dream Portfolio'' on island properties for stays during,
before, or after the celebrations. For the millennium, expect to
stay at least two weeks because minimum stay requirements will
apply, said Peg Walsh of St. Barth Properties. The firm can also
help with airline reservations.

BALL WILL CRYSTALLIZE TIMES SQUARE ON NEW YEAR'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tradition is old but the ball is new. When the crowds gather
in Times Square on Dec. 31 to welcome in the year 2000, they'll
watch a dazzling ball made with Waterford crystal descend at
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Square New Year's Eve Ball will be a transparent
geodesic sphere, covered with an original Waterford design _ a ball
so special that it even has a name: Star of Hope. Here are some
facts about the ball that will majestically drop 77 feet to the
bottom of a pole atop the One Times Square building:
</P>
<P>
   --It weighs 500-plus pounds and is 6 feet in diameter _ about
the same weight and dimensions as the old ball.
</P>
<P>
   --The hand-crafted design consists of 504 triangular pieces of
Waterford crystal, each containing a central circle and a
seven-pointed star. The circle represents the earth and the star,
the seven continents. Deep-wedge cuts that surround each star
symbolize the diversity of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   --The crystal triangles will be bolted to 168 triangular lexan
panels. And the exterior of the ball will be studded with 168
``Philips Halogena 2000'' bulbs, designed for increased reflection.
</P>
<P>
   And here are facts about the annual celebration in the square:
</P>
<P>
   --The first ball-lowering ceremony was held in 1907.
</P>
<P>
   --The festivity draws a half-million people to Times Square
every New Year's and is telecast to more than a billion viewers
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   --This year's special festivity, called ``Times Square 2000, the
Global Celebration at the Crossroads of the World,'' will begin at
5:30 a.m. EST on Dec. 31, when the new year arrives in the South
Pacific. For 25 hours, the people and cultures of each of the
world's time zones will be celebrated using sight, sound,
pageantry, and special effects. Live video will be beamed from the
time zones to the crowds in Times Square via giant Panasonic
Astrovision screens. &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking of the square: Times Square now has a Web site:
Www.timessquareseek.com can tell you just about anything you want
to know about the square, with its 35 hotels, 40 theaters, 684
retailers, 268 restaurants, and 50 ``supersigns.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: Which is the only New York City borough attached to
the mainland? (Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: ``Manhattan'' comes from ``menatay,'' which is Delaware
Indian for ``island.''
</P>
<P>
   Quotable: ``New York's murder rate is down. Times Square is
family-friendly. New York has become your crazy drinking buddy who
got married and had kids'' _ Colin Quinn on ``Saturday Night
Live.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's loopy law: In New York, it is illegal to throw a ball at
someone's head just for the fun of it. &QL;

Dream on: Chances of a white Christmas in New York are 1 in 4. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Netting a freebie: You can visit the Web, check e-mail, and send
messages from the third-floor Sky View Bar at JFK Terminal 4.
Access to the computer work stations is free for all, but they
probably won't mind if you order a drink. Take the escalator from
the central area of the terminal. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quite a community: New York City has the largest Jewish community
(1.75 million people) outside Israel (5.6 million people). &QL; 
 &QL; 
Welcome back: The venerable Russian Tea Room (known to some as the
RTR) is reopening Oct. 11 after a makeover that is said to preserve
the best of the old while incorporating the creative flair of
restaurant impresario Warner LeRoy. Also sometime in October, the
Radio City Music Hall will complete a $70 million renovation
designed to restore the Art Deco landmark to its original 1932
grandeur and at the same time modernize the facility. (The Russian
Tea Room is at 150 West 57th St. between Sixth and Seventh avenues;
call 212-974-2111. Radio City Music Hall is at 1260 Sixth Ave. at
49th Street; call 212-247-4777). And beginning Oct. 1, a
refurbished Rainbow Room, that gilded, glass-walled supper club
with its amazing views from the 65th floor high above Rockefeller
Center, will reopen for dinner and dancing on Friday nights and
brunch on Sundays. &QL;

MIDWEST DAIRY FARMERS OPPOSE N.E. SAFETY VALVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINERAL POINT, Wis. _ Dick Gorder has ``got milk,'' just as the
billboards suggest along the highway to his farm. As the owner of
50 cows in the heart of dairyland, he has also got a major problem:
the milk business in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Gorder keeps the same routine each day, herding his animals into
a milking stall every 12 hours, pumping 1,350 pounds into a steel
tank. But his paycheck is anything but predictable, rising and
falling with the whims of the milk market. Sometimes, the plant he
sells to pays $16 per hundred pounds of milk. Sometimes it's a lot
less.
</P>
<P>
   But a wildly fluctuating market isn't what's bothering Gorder.
His beef is with the Northeast Dairy Compact, formed by New England
farmers three years ago to dictate a minimum price for their milk _
and to ensure they never had to worry about the market at all.
Gorder says he is being discriminated against. And along with a
horde of angry Wisconsin farmers, dairy processors and politicians,
he is ready to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't come out and say it, but they just can't compete in
the free market,'' said Gorder, 43.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is now stirring passions on Capitol Hill, where a
number of milk disputes are coming to a head, including
authorization for the Northeast Dairy Compact, which is scheduled
to expire on Friday. Other issues involve complex pricing
structures and conflicting economic analyses, with each side
insisting its plan will result in lower milk prices at the grocery
store.
</P>
<P>
   But fundamentally, the controversy stems from the way the milk
business has changed over the last century, as refrigeration has
made it easier for dairy products to travel great distances and as
many small farms have given way to dairy conglomerates. The debate
boils down to a regional difference of opinion on a single matter:
whether or not the government should fight to keep small farms
alive and ensure each region is drinking local milk.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, when the national milk-pricing system was
established, the answer was easy. To make sure consumers everywhere
had a ready supply of milk in an era of poor refrigeration and
poorer highways, the federal government devised a formula to
encourage dairy farming in places where it wasn't profitable, such
as the East Coast and the South. The price, the government decided,
would be roughly calculated based on the distance a farmer was from
Eau Claire, Wis. The farther the farmer was from the heart of
America's dairyland, the more he would be paid for milk in any
given month.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress voted to make the system more efficient as
part of its larger farming overhaul, demanding a new structure be
established in 1999. But at the same time, the six New England
states launched a campaign to shield their dairy farmers against
the whims of the market. With Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of
Vermont, taking the lead, Congress granted a three-year program for
a 26-member commission to regulate New England milk prices,
otherwise called the Northeast Dairy Compact.
</P>
<P>
   Each month, under compact rules, the commission sets a minimum
price that processors have to pay farmers for their milk,
regardless of the federal price. The expiration date was set for
Oct. 1, 1999. And according to opponents, that's when the compact
should be abolished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: Do we develop 21st century policies to match
the 21st century realities of the dairy business?'' said Allen
Rosenfeld, an economist for the International Dairy Foods
Association, which strongly opposes compacts.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the compact, however, say it has been an
unmitigated success, helping stabilize payments to New England's
4,000 dairy farmers, who have received $75 million more during the
past two years than they would have with federal milk rates. Each
farmer has received an additional $10,000 to $13,000, said a
Vermont Senate aide.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers have benefited too, compact advocates say, pointing to
a 1998 study by the Office of Management and Budget that found
consumer milk prices in New England were five cents lower than in
the rest of the country during the compact's first six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a hard time understanding why the Midwest is so opposed
to it,'' said Jacques Couture, 49, a dairy farmer from Westfield,
Vt., during a visit to Capitol Hill last week. ``In New England, it
has proven not to do some of the things people were afraid of. The
price of milk has not gone up. The scare stories haven't
materialized. And it's not costing taxpayers any money.''
</P>
<P>
   For his farm, Couture said, ``It has taken out some of the peaks
and valleys. It's like a minimum wage, in a sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, dairy farmers in the Mid-Atlantic region and the Deep
South have looked on with envy. Faced with the same volatile price
swings that once afflicted the Northeast, an additional 21 states
decided they, too, want a compact. Now, Congress is slated to
consider allowing six Mid-Atlantic states into the Northeast
compact, as well as whether to allow 15 states, stretching from
Florida to West Virginia, to form a Southern Dairy Compact.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling coalition _ which represents 40 percent of the
dairy industry _ has incited the wrath of Midwestern officials,
creating unusual political alliances and erasing the normal
assumptions about which politicians support free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Senators Russell Feingold and Herb Kohl, both Democrats of
Wisconsin, have teamed up with Senator Rod Grams, Republican of
Minnesota, as well as Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, to combat
what they term the ``price-fixing cartels.'' In Wisconsin, where
farmers produce roughly 28 percent of the nation's cheese, the
outrage is palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the dairy compacts address only the price of milk,
the Wisconsin farmers say that mandated minimums would encourage
overproduction in the compact states, where the perishable excess
milk would be turned into cheese. That cheese would then flood the
market, causing prices to plummet, Midwestern farmers fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New England compact, from their perspective, is just the
tip of the iceberg,'' Rosenfeld said. Expanding the compacts, he
said, ``is the specter looming on the horizon that everyone's
afraid of.''
</P>
<P>
   With negotiations over the compacts heating up this week in
Congress, the Midwesterners have indicated they will go great
lengths to defeat their regional foes. In a letter to constituents
earlier this year, Leahy and Senator James M. Jeffords, the Vermont
Republican, compared the opposition's attitude to that ``normally
associated with wartime enemies.'' And Kohl _ who earlier this year
attached 70 amendments to a measure to reauthorize the Northeast
Dairy Compact in an attempt to kill it _ wouldn't argue with that
assessment. He said the battle ``is personal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have compacts for milk, why don't we have compacts for
other products?'' Kohl said. ``The compact expires October 1, and
that's when it should go out of business. Nobody argues it's good
economic policy. Nobody. They want to argue that it's good for
dairy farmers? Well, I come from Wisconsin, a dairy state. And I
don't think that's the case.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a substantial difference between dairy farming in
Wisconsin and Vermont, namely availability of land and cow feed.
Advocates of the compacts argue that if the free market were at
play, the nation's dairy farms would eventually consist of a few,
massive commercial operations in the Midwest _ which given their
sheer size, would pollute the environment with excess manure. And
because of the Midwesterners' de facto monopoly over the milk
market, the argument goes, prices for consumers would skyrocket in
places farthest away.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, dairy farmers outside the Midwest say they are
battling goliaths to preserve a rural way of life. Their strength
was evident last week, when the House voted against restructuring
the national milk-pricing system in favor of a plan similar to the
status quo, which more or less guarantees farmers in the East a
higher price than those in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   As with the dairy compacts, there were regional dividing lines,
but with a peculiar twist in that vote. Only five House members
from Massachusetts _ Representatives J. Joseph Moakley of South
Boston, John I. Olver of Springfield, Richard E. Neal of
Springfield and James P. McGovern of Worcester, all Democrats _
voted to retain the current pricing plan. The other five members of
the House delegation, without any dairy farmers in their district,
voted to change the system to one more market-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   Gorder, for his part, isn't worried about going out of business
yet. While the fierceness of the debate suggests the Northeast
coalition is threatening the existence of the Midwestern farms, his
concern, as a member of the board of directors of the Wisconsin
Farm Bureau, is the growing coalition would gradually erode the $17
billion dairy industry in Wisconsin. He also worries about his own
farm. ``Why should I go out and spend $200,000 upgrading equipment
when the government is discriminating against me?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, it is a ``matter of principle,'' he said,
strolling from his farmhouse to the barn to shoo the cows out to
pasture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just really have a fundamental problem with the way it's
being done,'' he said. ``People in Boston should have a problem
with it. It's not that their farmers are getting too much for the
product. It's just a matter of being fair.''

MINISTER TRAVELS IN QUEST FOR BISHOP'S SEAT

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ For the Rev. Leroy Attles, the popular pastor
at St. Paul AME Church in Central Square, campaigning to become a
bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal Church is as demanding as
running for president.
</P>
<P>
   Like a steadfast politician, Attles is making his third bid to
become one of the 19 bishops who oversee 2.5 million members
globally. They are coveted positions that typically become
available only if a bishop dies or resigns.
</P>
<P>
   And like any politician, Attles has been diligently raising
money _ about $30,000 in four years _ as well as printing brochures
highlighting his background and experience. He has a couple of
speeches memorized to try to convince AME delegates in the United
States, Canada, southern Africa, and the Caribbean that he is the
person they should vote for in the July 2000 election in
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go to the backwood roads of Alabama and Georgia, to a
church with just three people in it, and they will know my name,''
Attles said in a recent interview at the church's Christian Life
Center. ``I know three times as many people now as I knew in 1992,
when I was first introduced to the general conference. The issue is
to become well known.''
</P>
<P>
   The general conference is the engine of the historically black
church, founded in Philadelphia in 1787 as a civil rights group
known as the Free African Society. It meets every four years to
handle the church's business _ including the election and
reassignment of bishops _ across international borders and the time
zones of the AME's 19 global districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like a worldwide campaign, and there is politicking and
public relations,'' said Bishop Vinton R. Anderson, who is based in
Washington, D.C., and presides over the AME's Second District,
which includes the mid-Atlantic states.
</P>
<P>
   In determining eligible candidates _ and, this time, women are
among the contenders _ Anderson said he and others casting ballots
look at the ``measure of faithfulness and productivity they have
shown in the local churches they have pastored. I expect them to be
a stimulus to encourage a broad ministry in the churches under
their care.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Gregory G. Groover, pastor at Charles Street AME Church
in Roxbury, said Attles is indeed that stimulus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a rare pastor's heart,'' Groover said. ``His ministry,
in my estimation, is incomparable to any other church in Greater
Boston because of his social outreach. Cambridge is a better city,
particularly for African-Americans, because of the impact of (his)
church.''
</P>
<P>
   Attles is one of 26 candidates vying for two bishop slots. With
a decade of campaigning under his belt _ his first time on the
ballot was 1992 _ Attles might just make it this time, many in the
AME church say.
</P>
<P>
   He certainly has, by many accounts, an impressive resume. Since
he came to St. Paul's from New Jersey 22 years ago, membership in
Attles's congregation has blossomed from 500 to 1,400.
</P>
<P>
   And placing a premium on outreach outside the church walls,
Attles and his wife, Henrietta, both of whom hold doctoral degrees
in education, have increased enrollment in the church's Henry
Buckner School, which is open to all children in pre-school through
first grade. Attles started weekend tutoring in math and science, a
theater group, a children's choir, and liturgical dance.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, Attles talked his parishioners into
redirecting hard-earned money, which had been earmarked to renovate
the church, toward remodeling the old parsonage and another house
on Columbia Street into a 14-room shelter for homeless families. A
decade ago, at Attles's prompting, the church bought and renovated
what is now the Christian Life Center for $1.6 million, a bustling
community center that houses the school, offices, an auditorium,
and a chapel. Attles also runs ministries for the deaf and for
prisoners and a radio broadcast ministry directed at East Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ogletree, a renowned Harvard Law School professor,
joined Attles's church in the 1970s as a law student and returned
in 1986 after moving back to Massachusetts. ``He has done a
tremendous job and that is evident in the number of ministers that
have trained under him,'' Ogletree said. ``He is the embodiment of
our church.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Attles continues to criss-cross the nation in his
quest for the bishop's slot. Two weeks ago he flew from Miami to
Chicago. Last week, in the span of three days, he traveled to Ohio,
Mississippi, and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happiest doing ministry,'' said Attles. As bishop, he
added, ``I can do what I have done here on a larger scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Next July 4, about 1,600 voters in the general conference will
cast ballots to fill the two bishop vacancies _ one in Capetown,
South Africa, and the other in the midwestern United States
district.
</P>
<P>
   Once the new bishops are elected, a committee will reassign all
the denomination's bishops as it sees fit, which means Attles, if
elected, could find himself heading any AME district. He would have
three months to wrap up business here before reporting for his new
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about what I will have left here,'' Attles said,
weighing his feelings about leaving _ or staying. ``I'm at peace
either way.''

THE RULES OF THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Wall Street Journal just published a list of the world's
hundred biggest public companies, and the biggest surprise was that
General Motors wasn't on it.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was number one. General Electric was second, IBM
third, and Wal-Mart Stores fourth. No surprises there.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Cisco and Lucent ahead of Royal Dutch Shell. That
raised an eyebrow or two.
</P>
<P>
   Intel ahead of Exxon, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone ahead of
AT&AMP;T, Merck ahead of Amoco. Thirteen places and no GM?
</P>
<P>
   A friend had called to share the joke. America's best business
newspaper had forgotten America's biggest automotive company _ a
major advertiser, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   We scoured the list. Perhaps some obscure concept was being
employed that ruled out auto companies. Nope, Toyota was number 23.
DaimlerChrysler was number 39 (before last year's merger, numbers
63 and 99, respectively.) Ford was number 66.
</P>
<P>
   No General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe somehow nearer the end of the list than the beginning?
Have they stopped making Chevrolets? Not there either. Hopkinton's
EMC Corp. was number 80. Gillette was number 91.
</P>
<P>
   The last half dozen entries were a reminder of the polyglot
world of big business: Charles Schwab (US). TotalFina (France).
Sony (Japan). Barclays (UK). The Gap (US). AXA Group (France).
Aegon (Netherlands).
</P>
<P>
   There was no place for GM on this list.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, of course, is that the Wall Street Journal had
ranked firms according to their market value, not their sales.
</P>
<P>
   Multiply the number of GM's shares by its recent price and it
comes to about $40 billion _ around $3 billion shy of the $42.9
billion that permitted Aegon to make the list at the 100 spot.
Microsoft, at number one, was worth more than 10 times as much, at
$460.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But then why wouldn't it be? Microsoft earned $7.8 billion on
sales of $19.7 billion in fiscal 1998 _ 73 percent ahead of the
year before.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Aegon (whose business is pensions and insurance)
earned $1.5 billion on sales of $12.8 billion in 1998, a profit
margin we'd all be glad to have, but nothing like Microsoft's.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal chose the right yardstick, at least for
simplicity's sake. There are, of course, all sorts of ways to
describe the world's ``biggest'' companies.
</P>
<P>
   By sales? That used to be the tradition, when businesses were
much more settled into various grooves, thanks to existing
technologies, regulatory authorities, and national boundaries. And
goodness knows General Motors has plenty of sales _ $161.3 billion
in 1998, or about eight times more than Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   That's why GM was number one in the more traditional Fortune 500
ranking by sales this year _ just ahead of Ford ($144.4 billion),
Wal-Mart ($139.2 billion), Exxon ($100.7 billion), General Electric
($100.5 billion), and IBM ($81.7 billion.)
</P>
<P>
   Assets, too, can make a company large. With their huge
portfolios of loans, financial institutions top these lists:
Citigroup ($668.6 billion), ahead of BankAmericorp ($617.7
billion), Fannie Mae ($485.0 billion), and Chase Manhattan ($365.9
billion.) And employees: General Electric has 293,000 employees,
while EMC has only 9,400.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are any number of measures of profitability:
return on shareholder's equity, return on total equity (which
includes debt), rule-of-thumb measures like earnings per share.
With shareholder equity of $15 billion, GE returned 19.7 percent
this year _ a lot better than your cash-management account.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure of market values tends to wrap profitability up
in a single tidy package. A company's share price, after all, rises
and falls each day on the collective expectation of where its
fortunes are headed.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the lofty valuations accorded companies like Microsoft,
Cisco, and Lucent (Microsoft's current price/earnings ratio is 64)
reflect the shared opinion that the companies will continue to grow
rapidly, while General Motors's sorry valuation (its P/E is 9)
reflects the expectation that the troubled company will continue to
struggle and, perhaps, to continue to sink.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it makes sense to rank companies by their market
value. It highlights the news, good and bad.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1922, the journalist Walter Lippmann imagined a worldwide
``machinery of knowledge'' that would transform society and empower
individuals. Today, as institutions from Congress to bait shops put
themselves on line, the World Wide Web might seem to fulfill
Lippmann's utopian vision.
</P>
<P>
   But a chief skeptic of such a view turns out to be the British
researcher who invented the Web and who now guides its development
from a post at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``Weaving the Web,'' Tim Berners-Lee writes
that big improvements are still needed in the Web's underlying
technology before it can give rise to what he calls ``social
engines,'' such as the staging of national elections or political
debates on line.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Berners-Lee writes, the Web is only a tool, ``at once
the great equalizer and the great divider.'' Computers are best
applied, he writes, ``if we use them to create . . . processes in
which the people do the creative work and the machine does the
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-written with Mark Fischetti and just being shipped by
HarperCollins, ``Weaving the Web'' comes out at a time of unbridled
enthusiasm for the social and economic possiblities of the new
medium and the riches it has created.
</P>
<P>
   The book combines an explanation of Berners-Lee's goals at the
MIT-based group he directs, the World Wide Web Consortium, with a
history of the codes he wrote to allow computers to exchange text
and images and the partnerships he struck that first gave rise to
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   It also introduces 44-year-old Berners-Lee as something of a
critic of the hype surrounding the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his contribution, Berners-Lee has remained apart from
the Internet gold rush. His MIT job pays a maximum salary of
$90,000, and in 1998 he won a $270,000 grant from the MacArthur
Foundation. Yet both pale beside the riches that have flowed to
founders of many companies spawned by the Web, such as portal firm
Yahoo Inc. and retailer Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Berners-Lee explains that he has turned down several offers from
the private sector because they would have limited his ability to
direct the Web's design. While he praises the success of many
Internet start-ups, he also expresses concern at the get-rich-quick
ethos of much attention given the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is maddening is the terrible notion that a person's value
depends on how important and financially successful they are and
that that is measured in terms of money,'' he writes. ``If your
requirement is to make a large amount of money, then your options
in life are rather small,'' he said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues at MIT have heard this before. Berners-Lee craves
clout more than cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not interested in being filthy rich or (in) doing the
things that are required to get there,'' said Al Vezza, formerly a
top administrator at the school and now president of Fortech
Seminars Inc. in Reston, Va. ``He's come to the conclusion that he
can be most effective by being pure. What's important to him is
having influence. That's his megalomania and his baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Berners-Lee came to MIT by way of Switzerland, where he spent
much of the 1980s as a graduate student.
</P>
<P>
   As recounted in ``Weaving the Web,'' it was at the CERN physics
laboratory in Geneva that Berners-Lee first began to write programs
designed to allow computers to exchange information via data
networks. Specifically, Berners-Lee developed the software
conventions that are key to the Web's usefulness, with acronyms
like URL (uniform resource locator) and HTTP (hypertext transfer
protocol).
</P>
<P>
   But CERN never fully supported Berners-Lee's projects, and in
1994 he agreed to set up the World Wide Web Consortium, or the W3C
as it is known in techspeak, at MIT's Laboratory for Computer
Science.
</P>
<P>
   The W3C provides a forum for Internet companies to hash out
technical disagreements over code for the Web, the graphics portion
of the Internet. Today members include 355 companies from Boeing
Co. to China Times Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   Berners-Lee seems happy in his role as director, a post he took
because it left him ``free to really think about what was best for
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say the price of Berners-Lee's job satisfaction is an
organization that fudges tough policy questions. One example
relates to the variety of codes used by Web designers to ensure
that their pages will work with different Web browsers, such as
Microsoft's Internet Explorer or America Online's Netscape
Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, Web pages should work in all browsers equally,
according to a format recommended by the W3C in December 1996,
known as ``Cascading Style Sheets.'' But in practice, neither
Microsoft nor Netscape browsers support all the W3C's suggestions,
and neither company has faced any sanctions as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The situation vexes some designers, who say it can cost an extra
25 percent to ensure their sites work with all browsers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like if you needed five different televisions to watch
five different channels,'' says George Olsen, who heads the Web
Standards Project, a Los Angeles lobbying group that would like the
W3C to enforce stricter rules.
</P>
<P>
   Berners-Lee acknowledges Olsen's point but says ``that doesn't
mean that W3C should play Web police,'' partly since it can't lean
on companies like Netscape or Microsoft without driving them away.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the body insist on the time-consuming process of
seeking public comment before issuing its decisions. In ``Weaving
the Web,'' Berners-Lee explains that getting agreements requires
``a balancing act, between taking the time to stay as open as
possible and advancing at the speed demanded by the onrush of the
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapid growth of the Web in recent years has made Berners-Lee
a figure of much interest in Cambridge, Mass., where he lives with
his wife and two children. Though he doesn't teach courses at MIT,
he can often be seen biking to work or wandering the halls of the
old Polaroid Corp. building that houses his corner office.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues say the scraps of personal data in ``Weaving the
Web'' mark a breakthrough for Berners-Lee, who has never been
comfortable with questions about his private life. He remains so in
many respects, declining even to name his favorite commercial sites
on the Web, except for a few newspapers from home (such as
www.guardian.co.uk or www.the-times.co.uk). He says he must be
reticent to avoid seeming to endorse on-line retailers.
</P>
<P>
   But he will say that he recently began attending a Unitarian
Universalist church, a denomination that reminds him of his ideal
of the Web as a place where ``people think and discuss, argue, and
always try to be accepting of differences of opinion and ideas,''
he writes.
</P>
<P>
   People who work with Berners-Lee say the rare times he loses his
temper involve technical breakdowns, for example, Web sites with
broken links to other pages. Some clunky bank sites also come in
for criticism because they link consumers to older, slower
mainframe systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important to him that people think the Web works
as well as the stock market,'' said Dan Connolly, a W3C technical
staffer since 1994. Once, Connolly remembers, Berners-Lee
threatened to boycott a conferences organized by a Canadian data
provider after finding its Web site wanting.

HIKING WAGE IS MINIMUM JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even while historical documentation and solid evidence have
proven them wrong each time, Republican conservatives are still
using the ``sky will fall'' strategy to keep Congress from raising
the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, is
leading the struggle to raise the federal minimum wage during this
session from $5.15 an hour to $6.15 an hour _ 50 cents in January
2000 and another 50 cents in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The increase would add about $2,000 to the average yearly
minimum-wage income of $10,721 for full-time work. However, the
current annual income leaves a family of three $3,200 below the
poverty line, and the proposed increase would still leave them
below the federal poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Kennedy and other backers of the bill argue, that $2,000
would at least pay for seven months of groceries to feed the
average family or pay rent for five months or pay for almost 10
months of utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The last increase in the minimum wage was in 1996 and 1997, when
it was increased by 90 cents per hour over that two-year period.
Passage of that bill, also spearheaded by Kennedy, happened only
after Republicans were permitted to add $21 billion in tax breaks
for business to help counter the dire costs the wage hike would
have upon America.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, corporate lobbyists, and conservative think tanks
predicted that the increase would destroy the economy, that it
would cost working people their jobs and thus significantly
increase unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   However, as the facts have shown, unemployment during that
period decreased, even more so among the groups most affected by
the minimum wage: minorities, teenagers, and wage-earners without
college degrees. This year, two years after that increase in the
minimum wage, the unemployment rate among African-American men hit
its lowest level ever. And the overall unemployment rate dropped to
the current low of 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Various conservative studies also argued that the wage hike
would mostly benefit teenagers from affluent families. Yet latest
Labor Department figures show that 72 percent of minimum-wage
workers are adults 20 years of age or older and that more than half
are women. About half of these minimum-wage earners are full-time
workers, and one third work at least 20 hours a week. Their average
family incomes are about $15,000 below the national average.
</P>
<P>
   And while Republicans were arguing that an increase in the
minimum wage was too costly and too dangerous for the economy,
these same members of Congress recently gave themselves a
cost-of-living raise of $4,600 a year, adding to the $141,300
salary they already receive. Yet they would deny to 11 million
workers a minimum wage increase that would be less than half of
what they gave themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's bill calls for so modest an increase that it would not
even bring the minimum wage up to the level of 1968 in purchasing
power. That year, the real value of the minimum wage was $7.49,
more than $2.00 higher than the current rate of $5.15 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy and other supporters of the bill see the $1 an hour
increase as a realistic goal.
</P>
<P>
   As demonstrated with the passage of the last minimum-wage hike,
there are ways of getting this bill passed despite strong
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Key GOP members in the Senate are seeking to pass a bankruptcy
overhaul bill, which would make it more difficult for consumers to
avoid paying debts by declaring bankruptcy. But Republicans
withdrew the bill when it became apparent they didn't have the
votes to prevent the Democrats from attaching the minimum-wage hike
to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some Republicans conceded that in order to get their
bankruptcy bill passed, a minimum-wage increase must be attached to
the measure. With the Democrats having enough votes to block the
bill without the minimum-wage attachment, there is an increasing
possibility that the bill will be brought back to the floor. If
there is more debate on the minimum-wage bill, it should center on
why the GOP and their business supporters fight so hard against a
minimum-wage increase.
</P>
<P>
   Lest they forget, the minimum wage, according to one report, was
established in 1938 to ensure that US workers were fairly
compensated for a day's work. It's time that Republicans and their
business allies understand the basic reason why low-income workers
deserve a minimum wage increase. They earned it.

SUCCESSFUL POLITICIANS PLAY BY THE RULES OF POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has been a lot of grousing about this year's Republican
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists _ and most of the candidates _ don't like the fact
that the race seems to have been conceded to George W. Bush so
early, that Bush has raised far more money than his rivals and that
it takes so much money to mount a serious bid for the presidency.
Former Vice President Dan Quayle dropped out of the competition
Monday, in part, because he could not raise enough money. Quayle
had collected $5 million as of June, a fraction of what frontrunner
Bush had amassed.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a tip for the disgruntled politicos: If you'd been
reading the business pages the past few years, you would not find
any of these developments at all surprising. What's happening here
is that the political world is starting to play by the rules of the
business world.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptical? Well, we can think of at least three important
parallels.
</P>
<P>
   1. Outcomes are anticipated far in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who follows the stock market knows this one. If the Fed
is expected to raise interest rates in two weeks, the market falls
today, not two weeks from now. If Asian economies look as if they
are going to recover, the markets will rally _ even if the actual
recovery is a year away. The market's attitude is: Why wait if you
know what's going to happen?
</P>
<P>
   Republican voters and fundraisers seem to have adopted the same
philosophy. They've decided far in advance that George W. Bush is
the strongest candidate and the likely winner and they have flocked
en masse _ with their money _ to his camp.
</P>
<P>
   The losers complain that Bush is going to win because he has so
much money. In truth, the critics have it backward: He has so much
money because he is likely to win. Like investors, campaign
contributors want to get on the winning team as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
   2. The gap between first place and second place is growing.
</P>
<P>
   The thinkers at Mercer Management Consulting, a leading
consulting firm, have a term for this. They call it the ``silver
medal syndrome.'' Pick any pair of competitors: Coke vs. Pepsi,
Nike vs. Reebok, Gap vs. The Limited, Yahoo vs. Excite. If you
calculate the stock market values in each matchup, you will find
that the number one player in the field is worth dramatically more
than the runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these situations, the value that migrates to the gold medal
performer leaves the second place player gasping for breath,''
wrote two Mercer consultants in a book called ``Profit Patterns.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar, Elizabeth Dole and John McCain? Neither has been
able to raise even half the $50 million Bush has raised, even
though both are well-known, well-established challengers. Like it
or not, we live in a winner-take-all world. Second place today is
what fourth place used to be.
</P>
<P>
   3. It takes more money than ever to build your brand.
</P>
<P>
   EToys, an on-line toy retailer, Monday announced it was
launching a $20 million advertising campaign to build awareness of
the company for the upcoming Christmas buying season. A number of
young dot.com companies have shelled out $2 million to buy a single
advertising spot during next year's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   How come? Because they are convinced that only a small number of
companies will emerge as winners in any given field and that the
winners will be those that get out front early and create brand
awareness among consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have their own brands and message they want to get
across. Bush: The Compassionate Conservative; McCain: The Heroic
Maverick; Dole: The Female.
</P>
<P>
   Spreading the word costs a lot of money. According to Business
Week, 80 percent of campaign funding goes to television advertising
and the cost of a television spot has climbed 50 percent in the
course of this decade. Is it any wonder that presidential campaign
spending is expected to total $210 million this year, up from $82
million in 1992? Without the money for ads, cutting through the
clutter becomes next to impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Is the adoption of business rules a good thing for politics? We
don't have an opinion. But one thing is clear: Politicians who
expect to thrive in the current environment better brush up on
their business skills. Otherwise, like Dan Quayle, they could find
themselves in an irreversible bear market.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rising tide is lifting Boatscape.com, a fledgling Boston
company that hopes to serve the boating community.
</P>
<P>
   The company Monday said it landed a $5 million investment from
(at)Ventures, the venture capital arm of CMGI Inc. CMGI, based in
Andover, has investments in dozens of Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Boatscape.com was founded by Jay Wilkins, a graduate of
Dartmouth and the Harvard Business School. Wilkins wants boaters to
use the site for buying and sailing marine items and for sharing
ideas and information with fellow boaters.

WHAT WILL HELP OUR SCHOOLS _ AND WHAT WON'T 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To all presidents, senators, governors, mayors, and hopefuls
running to replace them: Please stop using our children as props
when offering silly sound bites to express your concerns about
public education in America.
</P>
<P>
   While she is certainly not alone in displaying this unfortunate
political vice, Elizabeth Dole did it most recently in
Massachusetts. The Republican presidential candidate last week drew
cameras to Melrose High School to showcase her allegedly deep
commitment to raise academic standards, promote local initiative,
and restore discipline and values in the nation's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The ``news'' of her visit boiled down to an endorsement of
searching student lockers and backpacks for drugs and weapons, as
if that would really do anything to improve public education.
</P>
<P>
   Violence in schools is terrifying. No mother wants to think that
Columbine could happen anywhere near her children. Quite frankly,
it probably won't. National crime statistics could not be clearer
on the point. Crime in schools is going down, not up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the reality of what public schools do face every day is
scary in another way.
</P>
<P>
   Reality is a letter from the father of a girl in second grade
passed on to a principal from the girl's teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are having some difficulty in helping (my daughter) with
her homework,'' the father wrote.`` My wife does not not speak or
read English very well. . . . I unfortunately work from 2 p.m. to
10 p.m. in Boston and don't get home until well after 11 p.m., and
at that time (my daughter) is already asleep. I am also unable to
change my shift. . . . I wonder if there is something we can do so
that she can get the help she needs. . . . I am willing to do
whatever is possible to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Reality is my 8-year-old neighbor, who has Down syndrome. His
smile brings joy to his mother's life and some to mine, too, now
that he has decided we can be friends.
</P>
<P>
   All his parents want is what the law supposedly requires _ a
place in a classroom in a public school around the corner from
their home. But a seemingly simple request for inclusion is
endlessly frustrated by a public school system that would rather
exclude him.
</P>
<P>
   As much as I am rooting for this little boy, I can see why
school administrators might view him as a burden, not a blessing.
They are beaten down by politicians _ and by parents _ who want
``results.'' And the results they demand are not measured child by
child but test score by test score.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, after all, Governor Paul Cellucci recently
said that every public school in the state will be ranked on the
basis of student scores on the Massachusetts Comprehensive
Assessment System tests.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a school superintendent or a principal, would you
want the special needs of special children to stand between you and
a higher rank? Even though you know intellectually that isn't the
case, wouldn't you be tempted to make them someone else's problem?
Pressed to prove you can deliver for the majority, it is only human
to shut out the even more dire needs of the minority. Private
schools do that as a matter of course and are richly rewarded for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Today's public school reality embraces a broad spectrum of need.
In between are your children and mine. The reality for them
includes large classes, outmoded textbooks, and technology at home
that very often outstrips what is available inside their school.
</P>
<P>
   The reality for those who teach our children is often
disheartening as well: old school buildings, cumbersome paperwork
and little in the way of perks, rewards or even encouragement. In
all the corporate tents lining the Ryder Cup course at The Country
Club, it's a fair bet that public school teachers weren't in on
much of the schmoozing. But they can look forward to continued
bashing by politicians and a frustrated public.
</P>
<P>
   Education reform is a step in the right direction. But we need
more dedicated funding for technology and other classroom
enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   Most working professionals turn on computers and check e-mail
and voice mail as a matter of everyday routine. For the most part,
the means of communicating with public school teachers is as
old-fashioned as the Pony Express. You send a note in a child's
backpack and hope it doesn't get thrown away with a snack, or you
leave a message with a school secretary and hope the teacher calls
back when you are not at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   No business is run that way, but that's the way we run the
business of public education in America.
</P>
<P>
   In the business world, it's a given that it takes money to make
money. Very simply, it takes money, not photo ops with our
children, to build a better school system. The politician who is
not afraid to utter that sound bite is the one worth heeding.

SINGLES HOPE TO MARK DATE OF THE CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There are fewer than 100 days before New Year's Eve
1999. Do you have a date yet?
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Kimball doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old divorced clothing designer would like to ring in
the millennium with the man of her dreams. She would like, just
this year, to be somewhere splendid.
</P>
<P>
   She has never been one for big New Year's Eve fests. With all
the couples kissing and cooing about their future plans, she finds
these parties painful. But this year is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just once I'd like to get dressed to the teeth and go out and
celebrate the way you see on TV,'' she said. ``I'd like to be
somewhere with a lot of people, just once, and feel part of that.
I'd like to be able to tell my grandchildren that I was in Times
Square, or some place grand.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Kimball is dateless, she is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Dating services and matchmakers say they are overwhelmed with
requests from singles alarmed about starting the year 2000 solo,
while their partnered friends jet to exotic destinations and
romantic celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   It's the annual angst about finding a date for New Year's Eve,
magnified many, many times.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is already on to have a date to herald in the new
millennium. And not just any date.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be able to look back 20 years from now and say you
did something really great,'' said Scott, 29, a single health care
professional, who asked that his last name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing,'' he said. ``You feel the
pressure to create a memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Some singles worry that the evening has a symbolic, or perhaps
even superstitious significance, setting the tone for a year of
love _ or loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   Scott isn't sure what his incredible experience will be. Perhaps
he'll commandeer a rooftop near Times Square in New York and
romance a lucky lady under the stars.
</P>
<P>
   Scott had hoped to be married by the turn of the century. But he
hasn't found the right person to share his life. With the stakes so
high, he, like others, is seeking professional help.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are worrying because it's almost the year 2000
and they haven't met anyone yet,'' said Elizabeth O'Malley, vice
president of The Right One, a dating service that is trying to help
Beverly, Scott, and many others find partners before the millennium
arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the Right One receives calls from singles who are
stressed out about greeting the new year alone. But the volume this
year is more than her counselors can recall ever having.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Year's Eve is always hard for single people. But this one
has a special significance,'' she said. ``They really don't want to
spend it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   For many who don't yet have dates, all the hype and
commercialism are adding to their anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere you go, you see millennium T-shirts, hats, jackets,
clocks, champagne glasses, jewelry, calendars, you name it,'' said
Michelle, 35, a divorced nurse and mother of one in Providence, who
also was uneasy about revealing her last name. ``I saw one woman
who looked like a billboard for the millennium _ and that was this
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My girlfriends say, `What are you going to do?' '' Michelle
continued. ``If you don't have something grand planned, people are
asking you: Why not? What's wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   A grand setting and a crowd of strangers don't appeal much to
Michael, a 42-year-old systems engineer who asked that his last
name not be used. He'll probably spend New Year's Eve with his
large, extended family.
</P>
<P>
   But he has higher hopes. He's stockpiling champagne and hunting
for someone special to enjoy it with him. With 94 days left in
1999, there is still time to find her, he believes.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, they have dinner and dancing, celebratory champagne,
and noisemakers with a few close friends, he said. ``But I wouldn't
argue if I found someone really special who just wanted a romantic
evening with pate, foie gras, champagne and caviar, maybe some
single malt scotch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of all the people who never got to see a millennium
turn,'' Michael said. ``We're here and we can enjoy it. If you miss
the opportunity now, you can't go back. It's like your high school
prom, only bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the unattached see opportunities for romance not just on
the next New Year's Eve but throughout the year 2000. They don't
believe the opportunities will last long, but for a few months,
perhaps, they think people may be more open, more friendly, more
receptive to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see people saying, `It's a new millenium, a clean slate,'''
said Cheryl Goodman, owner-director of The Post Club, a dating
service in Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are taking stock of their lives and hoping to start
fresh, with no mistakes this time,'' she said. ``The millennium is
giving them the push they need to make a change.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, artist Anna Maria Fraschini, who gave her age as ``60
plus,'' said she's ready to begin again.
</P>
<P>
   A divorced mother of three who has devoted herself to her
children for many years, she hopes ``to close with the past and
spend the rest of my life in a more interesting way,'' she said.
New Years' Eve is always important to her and this one has added
punch, said Fraschini, who was born in Italy and immigrated to the
United States three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She cites an Italian proverb on finding love: ``If you don't on
New Year's Eve, you won't the entire year.''
</P>
<P>
   So, like many others, she's searching for that special partner,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then she paused, and reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why only one?'' she quipped.

IT`S A RECYCLED `ALLY MCBEAL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ALLY 
Starring: Calista Flockhart, Lisa Nicole Carson, Gil Bellows,
Courtney Thorne-Smith, Greg Germann, Jane Krakowski 
On: Fox, Tuesday at 8 p.m. 
Rated: 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal'' is one of the most influential series on TV
right now. You can see it in the way surreal fantasy sequences are
as common as sex jokes on prime time, and you can see it in TV's
growing population of women in the legal field, from ``Family Law''
to ``Judging Amy.'' And most of all, you can see it in the
redefinition of the hourlong series, a format that was once
reserved for straight drama (not including iconoclastic flukes like
``Twin Peaks''). David E. Kelley's newfangled series has ushered in
an age of dramedic tone, one that enables TV comedy to rise above
the sitcom punchline. Love it or wish it would get flushed down the
unisex toilet, ``Ally McBeal'' has made mainstream TV into a less
easily labeled place.
</P>
<P>
   But let's hope that the latest ``Ally McBeal'' development has
absolutely no influence whatsover, that it fails so miserably and
so ``Cop Rock''-ly that no brilliant network honcho will ever
attempt it again unless he or she is secretly longing for intant
and permanent career death. Now Fox is introducing ``Ally,'' a
sorry new half-hour of programming comprised of footage and plots
already used in the hourlong ``Ally McBeal,'' as well as scenes
that were left on the cutting room floor. Unlike ``Ally McBeal,''
which weaves together a few plotlines, ``Ally'' is devoted entirely
to a single story, one that has been condensed and rearranged from
its original presentation. The network calls this approach ``a
quickie''; I call it regurgitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally'' is a contemptible idea on so many levels it's hard to
know where to begin. The most obvious place is the fact that this
new half hour is clearly designed not for creative purposes but
solely to cash in on ``Ally McBeal.'' Fox isn't even bothering to
lure the ``McBeal'' audience to Tuesday nights with a spinoff, the
kind we'll get from the makers of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and
``Party of Five'' in the next few weeks. Spinoffs are a
questionable affair, too, but they are definitely more dignified
than this lazy Reader's Digest move. At least they offer some
inventive possibility (``Rhoda,'' RIP). No, ``Ally'' is just
refried beans, a gaseous ploy both to make more money from
``McBeal'' right now, and to create a product that will easily lend
itself to a future stint in syndication _ a lucrative portion of
the life of a show. ``Ally'' represents the greedy soul of product
repurposing.
</P>
<P>
   Aren't we already oversaturated with re-TV? As the networks make
fewer new episodes of series, we are subjected to rewatching shows
two and three times a year, during ``the season'' and then again
during the summer. ``Ally'' is just so much rerun, albeit
rejiggered rerun. Of the three episodes of ``Ally'' sent to
critics, two were instantly familiar from their first incarnation
on ``McBeal.'' One has Ally's sanity under review by the board of
bar overseers after her supermarket mishap, and the second
chronicles the dispute between a minister and a choir singer played
by Jennifer Holliday. Sure, the graphics on ``Ally'' are different
from those on ``Ally McBeal,'' with fast-moving shots of Boston in
between scenes. And it's all edited together at a jauntier clip.
But it's really just stale goods in the guise of something fresh.
</P>
<P>
   What's sad about ``Ally'' is the impact it has on the mother
ship. As ``Ally'' disassembles episodes of ``McBeal'' in order to
pluck out a single strand, it demystifies ``McBeal'' and changes it
from an imaginative hour of TV into some kind of network supply
source. It makes ``McBeal'' seem less special, and more like a
factory whose product will be distributed through the week. It also
spreads the whole ``Ally'' ``McBeal'' phenomenon thin, giving us
too much time with a set of quirky characters who already run the
risk of wearing out their welcome. The proud owner of a few hours
of TV every week, David E. Kelley should have searched his soul a
little harder before signing off on this rehash.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: What vegetables can I plant this time of year?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sow carrot seeds right away.
</P>
<P>
   Sow several lettuce varieties now into November. Lettuce seeds
need light to germinate. Scratch the seeds into pre-moistened soil
with a rake. Cover with no more than one-eighth-inch of fine, light
soil. Mist to prevent the soil from drying. Seeds may germinate in
three to 12 days, depending on weather conditions. Thin seedlings
to eight to 12 inches apart. Toss the thinnings into a salad.
</P>
<P>
   Good lettuce choices include `Buttercrunch' and `Tom Thumb,' two
butterhead types of lettuce; and `Black Seeded Simpson,' `Oak
Leaf,' `Salad Bowl' and `Red Sails,' leaf types. Nurseries also
stock lettuce transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Add multiplying onion bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Set out broccoli transplants now through mid-October, and add
cabbage plants now into November. Sow mustard and radishes through
November.
</P>
<P>
   Sun and a loose, organically enriched and well-draining soil
will help ensure good results with vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When and how can I sow wildflowers?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ideal time to sow wildflowers is now to December. For
best results, provide good drainage, sun and seed-to-soil contact.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the area for sowing by removing weeds and other
vegetation. Rake the soil an inch down. Uniformly broadcast the
seed, then repeat in a perpendicular direction. To aid in
distribution of seed, you can combine the seed with sand in a ratio
of four parts sand to one part seed. Press the seed into the soil
with a roller or by walking across the area.
</P>
<P>
   Water after you sow if there is insufficient rain, and pull any
weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to plant herbs. I've heard fall is a good time.
</P>
<P>
   A: Fall is an excellent time to add the following herbs to the
garden: bay, bee balm, borage (seed), catnip, chamomile, chervil
(seed and plants), chicory, clary sage plants, comfrey, coriander,
costmary, cumin (seeds), curry plants, dill, fennel, feverfew,
garden sage, garlic chives, germander, horehound, lamb's ear,
lavender, lemon balm, lovage, mints, nigella (seed), pineapple
salvia, oregano, onion chives, parsley, rosemary, rue, salad
burnet, santolina, sorrel, tansy and winter savory.
</P>
<P>
   Herbs need good drainage. You'll get the best results if you
plant in a raised bed of a relatively neutral (pH 6.5-7),
organically enriched soil or in containers, generally where they
will get at least six hours of sunlight. Adequate sunlight
encourages good development of the oils in the leaves. It is these
essential oils that give the herbs flavor and fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   You can design an herb garden as an element in your landscape,
or you can plant individual herbs among shrubs, flowering annuals
and perennials. One of the most frequently used designs in herb
gardening is the knot garden, a somewhat formal style that often
uses low hedges of fragrant evergreens such as germander, santolina
or boxwood around geometric patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Herbs also are attractive along a walkway, in kitchen window
boxes, as topiaries in terra-cotta pots or bordering a bed of old
roses.
</P>

ENTWINED LIVES 
Twins and What They Tell Us About Human Behavior 
By Nancy L. Segal 
Dutton, 396 pp., $27.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Traveling near my hometown in Maine this summer I stopped at a
roadside truck to buy fresh-picked corn and became uneasy at the
way the old woman tending the stand eyed me as she haphazardly
threw ears into a paper bag without counting them.
</P>
<P>
   Then it came. ``Are you one of the twins?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   It had been close to 30 years since anyone had addressed me this
way, and it stirred memories about how for most of my childhood and
adolescence my identity was connected to another's. I was ``one of
the twins'' _ or just ``twin'' _ to a lot of folks around these
parts. Along with the aforementioned question, there also came
``Which twin are you?'', ``Which one is older?'', and the
unanswerable favorite: ``What's it like to be a twin?''
</P>
<P>
   People's failure to see us as individuals was understandable _
my brother and I looked so much alike that even we were unable at
times to tell ourselves apart in photos _ but the curiosity and awe
we encountered daily often had a freak-show quality to it. A lot of
people didn't really want to know us, any more than they wanted to
know the dog-faced boy or the bearded lady on display at the county
fair. Yet people showed insatiable curiosity about the supposed
supernatural and sordid sides of ``twinning.'' Could we read each
other's thoughts? Did we share a secret language? When one gets
sick, does the other feel it? Could our girlfriends tell us apart,
and did we ever try to trick them (wink, wink)?
</P>
<P>
   The thirst for knowledge about twins and what they might tell us
about human behavior has increased over the years, reignited by a
spate of reports about twins who were raised apart but share eerily
similar traits.
</P>
<P>
   Though this quest for understanding twinship may be a worthwhile
pursuit, a lot of it strikes me as silly. A Minnesota study of
twins raised separately found a pair who each had been married
twice to women named Linda and Betty and who also had sons named
James Allen and James Allan. So this proves . . . what? There's a
genetic predisposition to the names we encounter in our lives?
</P>
<P>
   The latest attempt to make sense of the twin phenomenon and
explain how it applies to ``singletons'' is ``Entwined Lives,'' by
twin researcher Nancy L. Segal. Though crammed with minute details
about every biological, physical, and psychological aspect of
twindom, it might be hard for a reader to get beyond the author's
immature attraction to twins (she is director of the Twins Study
Center at California State University, and was formerly with the
Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart). Particularly noticeable is
Segal's curious worship of identical twins over fraternal twins,
though she is herself a fraternal twin.
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughly researched, annotated, and footnoted, ``Entwined
Lives'' is impressive in the breadth of its study, but its
clinical, academic delivery doesn't provide much room for twins or
parents of twins seeking advice, and the material barely lives up
to its subtitle of explaining how twin research relates to
understanding overall human behavior _ though we are reminded
nearly once per chapter that it does.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of interesting fodder here, though: the fact
that hair whorls on identical twins often go in opposite
directions, that left-handed twins frequently have higher IQs than
their right-handed siblings, that first-born twins are likely to be
heavier than the second-born. There are interviews with semi-famous
twins (Marc and Stephen V. Roberts, William and David Koch among
them), and much on what twin research tells us about athletic
prowess and how court cases involving twins have affected legal
decisons involving wrongful death suits and injury.
</P>
<P>
   But little of it is likely to reverberate with general readers,
even if much of it did catch my attention _ I am, after all, a
left-handed first-born twin (I haven't checked my hair whorl).
</P>
<P>
   Segal has an annoying tendency to state the obvious. To wit:
``Some people's lives are a monotony of misfortunes, while other
people's lives are relatively tragedy-free. Twin studies are
showing us that things do not just happen, but that personality
traits may affect the sequence of life events.'' Or this:
``Identical twins generally show greater similarity than fraternal
twins.'' Or this: ``Identical twins are not identical in every
way.'' Segal is convinced that twins are living lab rats and
actually devotes a chapter to the ``living laboratory'' of twins.
She frequently mentions how her status as researcher affords her a
``ringside seat,'' or how twins are ``a natural experiment,'' or
are ``reflecting pools whose altered images teach us how the range
of environmental influences shape developmental outcomes.''
</P>
<P>
   The book even tilts toward the lurid, with a chapter on dealing
with the loss of a twin, and ventures perilously close to the
carnival sideshow with another devoted to conjoined twins _ replete
with photos of twins physically connected by various shared organs.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``Entwined Lives'' may reveal more about the depth
of people's odd fascination with twins and about the author's
admitted ``reverence'' for them than it does about what twin
studies really contribute to knowledge of human behavior. Twins,
however, will learn a little and will certainly relate to many of
the anecdotes and findings _ provided they can get beyond the
feeling that their lives are being poked and prodded and observed
under a microscope as well as a circus tent.

PBS EXPLORES POPE'S IMPACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Pope John Paul II made his procession through Boston in
1979, the sidewalk outside my Commonwealth Avenue apartment
disappeared beneath throngs of mesmerized undergraduates who seemed
to view it as a bigger event than Springsteen and the Stones put
together.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the pope would have had stern words for the lifestyles
of the youthful spectators who cheered him so fervently. But
something about this remarkable figure has always compelled
attention, even among the many who disagree with him. In an era
when all beliefs seem up for grabs, his unblinking certitude has
made him a potentmoral force.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it has also made him a controversial political force.
Those twin strands are entwined in ``John Paul II: The Millennial
Pope,'' a ``Frontline'' documentary airing Tuesday at 9 p.m. Though
its attempt to be a ``thematic biography'' sometimes results in
missteps, overall this is an ambitious, nuanced, and absorbing
attempt to illuminate the man born Karol Wojtyla 79 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The passions John Paul II evokes are on display here: Full voice
is given to the pope's adherents and slightly fuller voice to his
critics. The former argue that he is a pope for the ages who has
forced the world to think about faith in a new way, while the
latter find him retrograde in his opposition to reproductive
rights, to the ordination of women, and to modernity in general.
</P>
<P>
   But neither camp finds it easy to understand or to explain the
scholar, poet, athlete, actor, and playwright who ascended to the
seat of the Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, Frontline producer Helen Whitney seeks an explanation in
the haunted land of his birth, Poland. As a young man, the pope
lived under two monstrous tyrannies, Nazism and communism. ``The
Millennial Pope'' suggests that experience permanently darkened his
view of the 20th century and of human nature. But as the
documentary makes clear, it also prompted him to action when he
became pope.
</P>
<P>
   To a degree matched by few, if any, popes before him, he made a
top priority of combatting anti-Semitism. He unequivocally declared
it to be a sin, became the first pope to visit the synagogue in
Rome, and journeyed to Auschwitz. Were these steps rooted in guilt
at not doing more to help Jews during the Nazi occupation of
Poland? A Jewish filmmaker from Poland describes an interview in
which a clearly tormented pope said ``No'' when asked whether he
had taken steps to help his Jewish friends during the war (even
though the filmmaker had heard stories that he had). Then the pope
``took me in his arms like a brother with a very bad guilty
feeling,'' the filmmaker says.
</P>
<P>
   The most stirring portion of ``The Millennial Pope'' chronicles
the pope's role in inspiring his fellow Poles to throw off the
shackles of communism. When he became pope, his message to them
was: ``Be not afraid.'' A year later, his jubilant countrymen
crowded the streets of Warsaw as the pope returned home for a
confrontation with General Jaruzelski, the Polish leader, whose
knees were shaking. ``And suddenly, everybody stopped being
afraid,'' says writer Adam Zamoyski. ``That gave the strength for
Solidarity and for the destruction of the whole communist system.''
</P>
<P>
   But the documentary also zeroes in on what it portrays as the
pope's contradictions, particularly his opposition to the
``liberation theology'' espoused by Latin American priests.
Whitney's point of view is clear: Having helped to bring about the
end of one kind of dictatorship, he undermined efforts to battle
another kind. ``You have to wonder what would have happened if he
had made a different choice,'' says Washington Post reporter
Roberto Suro.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Millennial Pope'' also challenges the pope's view of
women, arguing that his resistance to a broader role for women in
the church runs counter to his veneration of the Virgin Mary.
Scholar Marina Warner calls the pope's views a ``ghastly sort of
stone against which we've stumbled for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary loses focus near its end, in a section titled
``Faith.'' In an attempt to create a ``spiritual encounter'' with
John Paul II _ who is not interviewed _ Whitney includes the
lengthy ruminations on faith of others, including authors Germaine
Greer and Robert Stone and cabaret performer Andrea Marcovicci. It
creates a disjointed effect.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, though, ``The Millennial Pope'' succeeds in finding
provocative ways to make you think. Not unlike its subject.

`CALIGULA': STILL GARBAGE, 20 YEARS LATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Goin' back to Cali.
</P>
<P>
   Not Cali as in the LL Cool J hip-hop classic, but Cali as in
``Caligula,'' Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione's relentlessly
perverse and depraved portrait of the relentlessly perverse and
depraved Roman emperor, Gaius Caesar Germanicus. Defying taste and
reason, Guccione is re-releasing the controversial 1979 film in 12
theaters nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   To which one can only ask: Why? Even in the broadest sense, this
is not a film worthy of new examination and discovery, such as
recent theatrical re-releases ``The Godfather'' or the original
``Star Wars.'' This is a film which, upon its release, critic Roger
Ebert called ``sickening, utterly worthless, shameful trash.''
``Caligula,'' he said, ``is not good art, it is not good cinema,
and it is not good porn.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not alone in his condemnation, because the film was
universally panned. A muddled, endless orgy of rape, necrophilia,
evisceration, murder, and bestiality, it wasn't lovably bad like
Edward Wood's ``Plan 9 from Outer Space,'' or so bad it was good,
like ``Mommie Dearest.'' It was so unmitigatingly horrid, Ebert
said, he walked out of the film ``disgusted and unspeakably
depressed'' about 120 minutes into its 155-minute length.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with every denouncement, public curiosity only
increased, and the film would go on to become something of a minor
cult hit. After years of the high road, I finally surrendered to
temptation when the film was shown on campus during my junior year
of college. After waiting for hours to get in, and fighting for the
best seats, people left in droves long before the final credits
rolled. Imagine just how bad a film _ especially one with lots of
unvarnished sex _ has to be to get college students to walk out.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, ``Caligula'' is the worst film ever made.
</P>
<P>
   In a year which has produced such mangy dogs as ``In Dreams,''
``Wild Wild West,'' and ``Jawbreaker,'' leave it to Guccione, the
dark prince of bad taste, to remind us of just how low abysmal
filmmaking can go. But what makes ``Caligula'' so extraordinarily
dreadful is that Guccione, who produced the film, had pretensions
of greatness. He honestly believed he was creating something as
indelible as Orson Welles's ``Citizen Kane.'' He somehow lured a
cast of A-list actors, including Peter O'Toole, Sir John Gielgud,
Helen Mirren, and Malcolm McDowell as Caligula. Gore Vidal wrote
the original screenplay, and three-time Academy Award-winner Danilo
Donati signed on as art director. And Guccione wrote every check to
finance the $17.5 million film, because no one else wanted anything
to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Because Guccione made his name as Penthouse publisher, no one
expected anything more than a high-priced skin flick. But in a
Penthouse interview prior to the film's February 1979 opening,
Guccione maintained ``Caligula'' was not a porno film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the film as being pornographic, and I certainly
didn't set out to make a pornographic movie. To me, pornography is
a work of bad art, as opposed to good art,'' he said. ``And I don't
think `Caligula' qualifies under the heading of bad art. It was a
huge commercial undertaking, and at the same time we wanted to make
a serious statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Believing ``Caligula'' would be branded with an X, Guccione
bypassed the Motion Picture Association of America, those picayune
folks who bestow ratings. An X rating, he said, would be
``demeaning and unfair,'' to the film.
</P>
<P>
   If the film had been worthy, ``Caligula'' could have been a
manifesto demanding reconciliation between serious drama and
graphic sexuality. Had Guccione created the ``landmark'' film he
deluded himself into believing he had, he would have been a
trailblazer, perhaps curtailing the ever-testy debate about the
kiss-of-death NC-17 rating (essentially as lethal as an X at the
box office), and the shoddy treatment of such adult, sexually frank
films as ``Happiness,'' ``Summer of Sam,'' and ``Eyes Wide Shut.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Guccione lived down to low expectations, although he
was right in believing ``Caligula'' did not qualify under the
heading of bad art. It's far more insidious. It's a horrifically
violent porn film masquerading as a historical epic. Void of any
merit, save for the oddity of watching the exact moment when
Malcolm McDowell's career crashed and burned, there was no other
reason to tell this story other than to revel in the Bacchanalian
excesses of a power-mad ruler who behaved like a nasty mixture of
Marquis de Sade, Ted Bundy, and Jerry Springer.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the film's infamy will again seduce the curious, as
well as those who conclude that any film deemed so terrible must be
worth seeing, if only as a lark. Recently, Guccione said, ``Never
in the 20 years since it was released has an adult film of this
caliber been duplicated.'' Another generation of moviegoers will
soon learn why that's something we should all be thankful for.

<P>
   BANDELIER, N.M. _ Where goes the neighborhood?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows exactly what happened _ or why _ to the folks who
lived here in Frijoles Canyon, in what I like to call Beantown I
because ``frijoles'' translates as ``beans'' in Spanish, and they
were bean eaters. Like the people of Beantown II (a.k.a. Boston), a
settlement that appeared on a shore quite far to the east about 100
years after Beantown I was abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The townsfolk, Indians called Anasazi (``ancient ones'' in
Navajo), have been gone for about four centuries. Just picked up
and left their beautiful neighborhood, and wandered into history.
</P>
<P>
   How come? Were they evicted by heartless landlords who raised
the rents too high? Did they feel the beans would be greener and
taste better somewhere else? Might a mighty drought have driven
them away?
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. For rooms with status as well as a view, the deserted
penthouses along the salmon-toned canyon wall are hard to beat. I
could see a developer making a huge score here, turning them into
condos with running-everything-plus-TV-dishes. Only 45 miles from
Santa Fe, but more peaceful and lovelier.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one fortunate thing. The government got here first,
and this has been a national park among the peaks and mesas of the
Jemez Mountains since 1916. The V-shaped canyon is narrow and
green, blessed with a bustling creek, scented by juniper and
skyscraping ponderosa pine, and loaded with stillness. But the only
way to move in is to camp for a while.
</P>
<P>
   First camper, of Caucasian stock anyway, was the modern-day
namesake, Bandelier himself, amateur archeologist out of Highland,
Ill. An immigrant born in Switzerland, Adolph Bandelier was
supposed to follow his father as a banker. Instead he followed a
yen for the Southwest and cashed in spiritually. In 1880 he and a
Cochiti tribesman guide, Juan Jose Montoya, stumbled into Frijoles
Canyon and this original Beantown without much idea of where they
were going.
</P>
<P>
   But they were taken by it immediately. ``The grandest thing I
ever saw,'' Bandelier wrote. ``A magnificent growth of pines,
encina, alamos, and towering cliffs . . . the cliffs are vertical
on the north side, and their bases are, for a length, used for
dwellings.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Bandelier's early disciples was Charles Lummis, a
newspapering Harvard alumnus who, in 1884, had walked from
Cincinnati to the Pacific (3,507 miles in 145 days), and was
particularly intrigued by his perambulating through the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   They teamed up, a couple of macho men, as Lummis wrote:
``Thousands of miles of wilderness and desert we trudged, camped,
starved, shivered, learned . . . up and down pathless cliffs,
through tangled canyons, fording icy streams and ankle-deep sands .
. . no blankets, overcoats or other shelter . . . our commissary a
few cakes of sweet chocolate and a small sack of parched popcorn
meal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has changed. At least in terrain. But you can drive in
now, and don't have to stoic-it-out on that kind of grub. Nobody
will make fun of you if you bring a coat or tent. The ghosts of the
Anasazi, undoubtedly lurking, have been mumbling, ``There goes the
neighborhood!'' ever since Bandelier and Lummis trudged in.
</P>
<P>
   Residential foundations and leftover walls of a community called
Tyuonyi are visible amid undergrowth of the canyon floor. They were
excavated around the turn of the century by a dapper archeologist
in puttees and bow tie, Edgar Lee Hewett, who was drawn by
Bandelier's reports.
</P>
<P>
   More fascinating are the sky suites, reached by pathways and
ladders. Those are the choice locations, studio apartments and
duplexes facing south, holes in the wall favored by the sun and the
vistas, offering better security. A real estate agent's dream. Some
are permanently decorated with petroglyphs, figures of humans and
animals, by avant-garde artists of the time (circa 1300 to 1500).
</P>
<P>
   ``Better than any Trump Tower,'' says my friend, Aurelio.
``Sorry we can't get a lease. Don't you love Mother Nature as an
architect?''
</P>
<P>
   Madly. Moving closer, you see that the canyon wall isn't merely
a steep, plain barrier. Delicately pitted spires and domes arise to
accompany other rock formations, almost Gothic in some stretches,
and garnished with lavender wildflowers. The playful Spanish
architect, Gaudi, would have rejoiced.
</P>
<P>
   In the late afternoon sun the rusty rocks are becoming pink. The
place is serene and empty, although hummingbirds and ravens zip
about. Peeping into the low-ceilinged apartments, you imagine those
long-ago neighbors in their paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Whooomp! The reverie is shattered by an explosion, the
fluttering of thousands of wings. Squeaking and flapping, a brown
cloud of Mexican free-tailed bats is spewing from their living-room
crevice into the evening air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supper time, and they're going batty,'' says Aurelio. ``Or
buggy. That's what they'll dine on. Stink bugs and fungus beetles
are their meat. These bats will eat about 500 insects an hour, half
their weight. They're born with toes and thumbs so they can hang
out when they aren't eating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bon appetit!'' we shout to the crowded, disappearing cloud.
There go the neighbors, today's Beantown I inhabitants that don't
give the least damn for beans.

WHERE WILL READERS BE ON 2000 ARRIVAL? 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Beverly Holmes isn't fretting about the exorbitant
cost of millennium-related events. Nor is she worried about
potential transportation snafus and Y2K computer failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing something unusual,'' writes Holmes, a Santa Fe,
Texas, resident. ``I'll be doing community service with Global
Volunteers in Mississippi from Dec. 26 to Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to be doing something useful and memorable when
the year 2000 arrives,'' Holmes continues. ``Global Volunteers will
have people working all over the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Minnesota-based company's Millennium Service Project
focuses on education, infrastructure and health-care projects
identified by people in host communities throughout the country.
(Information about specific destinations and costs is available on
the Internet at www.globalvolunteers.com/millmain.htm or by calling
800-487-1074.)
</P>
<P>
   Holmes has served twice previously in Tanzania, helping with
school construction.
</P>
<P>
   She was among readers who accepted our invitation to let us know
about their plans _ and concerns _ for millennium travel. Or
``moronium travel,'' as one reader, bound to official calendars,
dubs this celebration a year before the millennium actually
arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of responses:
</P>
<P>
   _ Most ambitious itinerary: ``I had this idea when I was in high
school in the mid-'80s and, luckily, I'll be able to make it
happen,'' writes Houstonian Pat Pearson. The agenda: ``Fly to
Australia, celebrate New Years 2000, hop on a plane early Jan. 1,
fly to Hawaii, arrive Dec. 31 (after crossing the International
dateline), celebrate New Years 2000 again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a group of nine people joining me on this little
adventure. We'll be some of the only people to celebrate two
millennium New Years. I certainly won't be around for the next
one.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Best surprise: Conroe, Texas, reader Nina Tannenbaum and her
husband, Daniel, will celebrate on Florianopolis, an island off the
Brazil coast south of Rio de Janeiro. ``We had been told that in
Brazil the custom is to wait for the New Year wearing white and
facing the ocean,'' Tannenbaum writes. ``I have therefore ordered a
white formal at a local shop. When the store called to let me know
that I needed to go in for the first fitting, the caller said ...
`for your wedding in December.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering that I have been married for more than 40 years, I
found that hilarious. I asked my husband, `Honey, would you like to
marry me all over again?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And he answered with an automatic, `Sure!'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Most levity: ``I'm experiencing millennium madness,'' writes
Houstonian Lisa Bunse. ``The symptoms of my `Why 2K' illness:
dizziness (`2' many choices), acid indigestion (`2' much money')
and nervous fingers (`2' good to sound true.)''
</P>
<P>
   _ Most intriguing philosophy: Houstonian Bruce Godwin, seeking
to celebrate ``like no other party in history,'' selected Las Vegas
as the most appropriate venue. ``Where else to be but `Sin City?'''
Godwin writes. ``If it is going to be the end of the world as some
believe, the Devil himself will be riding down the strip in a
Cadillac convertible. And the casinos are not turning off those
slot machines even if Armageddon comes. If there is a power
failure, they all have generators.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Godwin continues, ``All of the hotels on the strip wanted
$700-$2,000 per night with a three-night minimum. After days of
calls and Internet searching, I found the Best Western in nearby
Henderson for $149. Granted, that's triple the normal rate, it's
kind of small and overlooks the highway but ... I guess I can
gamble the $3,000 I saved by not staying on the strip.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Biggest disappointment: ``My mother wanted our entire family
to celebrate New Year's Eve in her home on Long Island,'' writes
Houstonian Caryl Zimmerman. ``My mom and dad, their four children
and their families remarkably are still alive, and we wanted to
toast that fact together as we crossed over into the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, my husband was told that no one from his office
can leave Houston from December to January in case they encounter
Y2K computer problems. I wonder if other folks will have to accept
raising a glass to the new century with a loved one on the phone
instead of actually being there to clink it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Largest gathering: When Houstonian Nancee Sells and her
husband decided to celebrate the holiday at their condominium on
Kauai's north shore, they inquired if several friends wanted to
join them. ``We were overwhelmed by the response,'' writes Sells.
``We needed 28 units.''
</P>
<P>
   The condo resort has planned three days of festivities for the
group, including a New Year's Eve luau and fireworks display. ``Our
only complaint? Airlines,'' Sells writes. Because of unexpectedly
high air fares, some friends have canceled. ``But we still have 20
units reserved. The best part? Some of our closest friends, their
adult children and the grandchildren will be together for a truly
momentous occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Best bargain: Houstonian Sally Walker Davies and her husband
were determined to welcome 2000 in Jackson Hole, Wyo. But, she
writes, ``Prices for most properties were at least twice their
regular holiday rates. About the time we were giving up, we found
the perfect place on the Internet. It's called Teton Ranch. Two log
cabins ... 150 feet apart on a working cattle ranch, with beautiful
views of the western slope of the Tetons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The holiday rate was $350 per night for both cabins _ a
bargain. Even better, the owners are a treat. They've promised to
take us on a snowmobile to find the perfect tree; they've even
asked our son to help care for a new foal they are expecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a perfect way to end one century and begin another.'' &QL;

THINK NEW YORK THIS FALL, WINTER 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York City is always a lively place to visit. And this fall
and winter are no exception.
</P>
<P>
   The theater scene is hot with 12 new shows opening this season
and six shows set for next spring. Thousands will make a pilgrimage
to the city for the holiday lights, shopping and shows, and, of
course, the Millennium celebration. Also on tap is the reopening in
October of the Art Deco Radio City Music Hall after a $70 million
renovation, new restaurants, and the reopening of the venerable
Russian Tea Room following a complete makeover.
</P>
<P>
   Opening Sept. 26 at the Whitney Museum of American Art is ``The
American Century Part II,'' which traces the changing American
identity from the postwar years through the advent of Internet
technology. The New York Historical Society offers ``Cass Gilbert:
Ten Projects,'' a survey of the architect's most famous works that
have shaped the New York skyline. The Metropolitan Museum of Art
goes back to the first great era of Egyptian art with some 200
works in ``Egyptian Art in the Age of the Pyramids.'' On Nov. 20,
``Body Art: Marks of Identity'' opens at the American Museum of
Natural History. The exhibit focuses on body decoration through the
ages. On Nov. 14, the Jewish Museum opens ``Berlin Metropolis: Jews
and the New Culture, 1890-1918.'' The Morgan Library is featuring
one of the most extensive exhibitions on the life, political
aspirations, and achievements of George Washington. ``The Great
Experiment: George Washington and the American Republic'' will be
on view through Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Children will enjoy ``Body Odyssey,'' a trip through a gigantic
reproduction of the body at the Children's Museum of Manhattan.
They'll also like seeing the 300-500 free-flying tropical

Barbecue festival
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's called the Super Bowl of barbecue competitions, and this
year it will be on Oct. 23 in Lynchburg, Tenn., a town known for
its whiskey. Lynchburg is home to the Jack Daniel Distillery,
America's oldest registered distillery. The distillery is in a
``dry'' area, so you can tour, but you can't buy a bottle of the
whiskey, except for a specially designed commemorative decanter,
allowed by a special act of the Tennessee Legislature in 1994.
While the competition is in the South, the barbecue is
international in flavor. Teams from around the country, as well as
Europe, Japan, and Canada will be competing. There also will be
games, music, and homemade Southern delectables, including fried
pies and roasted corn on the cob, for sale. For information on the
11th annual Jack Daniel's World Championship Invitational Barbecue,
call 615-340-1035.

   ATLANTA-AIRPORT (Atlanta) _ With 73.5 million passengers last
year, Hartsfield Atlanta International is now, incontestably, the
world's busiest airport. Hartsfield has also had a reputation as
one of the smoothest-running airports. But with its phenomenal
growth have come flight delays, parking shortages and clogged
traffic. So while Hartsfield may offer a shining example of how an
airport can become a giant and how a city can transform itself into
a global crossroads, it also provides a cautionary tale about the
downside of the boom in air travel. As more and more people take to
the skies, Atlanta and other cities have little choice but to make
do with existing airports, for the economics of building new ones
are increasingly prohibitive. By Edwin McDowell.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one will ever know what went through the mind of Artax when
he looked up in the stretch at Pimlico during Preakness Day in May
and saw a man standing in his path. The man threw dirt at Artax as
jockey Jorge Chavez struggled to keep the 4-year-old colt, the
odds-on favorite in the Maryland Breeders' Cup, from trampling his
attacker.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more bizarre episodes in racing, the man was
arrested, and Artax, who fell back from second to fifth, was
declared by the stewards to have run for purse money only, meaning
all bets on him were refunded. Artax's running line for that race
in the Daily Racing Form reads, ``Impeded by patron at
eighth-pole.''
</P>
<P>
   If psychology could work on an equine, Artax would have been a
challenging patient. The son of Marquetry had come into the May
15th race off a sensational victory May 2 at Aqueduct in the Grade
I Carter Handicap, in which he had run one of the fastest 7-furlong
clockings in history at 1:20, shattering the track record and
earning a speed figure that was off the charts. However, after the
race in Maryland, he lost five straight times _ culminating in a
fifth-place finish in the Forego at Saratoga Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, Artax proved he had cleared his head, as he
whistled to victory for the first time since the incident, winning
the Grade I, $250,000 Vosburgh Stakes at Belmont Park by better
than 3 lengths in 1:21 3/5 for 7 panels. The old Artax was back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He broke a little slow, but he recovered pretty fast,'' said
Chavez. ``I knew we were setting fast fractions, but I didn't want
to fight him. He's a tough horse to ride. He dug in and proved he's
one of the best sprinters in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Artax, who is owned by Ernie Paragallo and trained by Louis
Albertrani, was off at 4-1 ($10.60 to win) and beat a top opponent
in Crafty Friend, the winner of the Forego and the 4-5 favorite in
the Carter. Crafty Friend, who was ridden by Gary Stevens, chased
Artax through a blazing half mile of :44 3/5, then faded to fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole game with Artax is the break,'' said Paragallo. ``If
he breaks, they can't beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, there's a man standing in the stretch waiting
to toss a fistful of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Appeal' is successful
</P>
<P>
   Another outstanding sprinter had a big day Saturday, as
Successful Appeal captured the $250,000 Kentucky Cup Sprint at
Turfway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Away at 3-1 ($8.40 to win), with Edgar Prado aboard, Successful
Appeal powered his way past the extremely fast Five Star Day, the
3-5 choice under Alex Solis, to tally by 6 legnths in 1:09 2/5 for
6 furlongs. A 3-year-old son of Valid Appeal, Successful Appeal,
who is tained by John Kimmel, had finished third behind Forestry,
trained by Bob Baffert, and Five Star Day in the King's Bishop at
Saratoga Aug. 28. That race saw 6 furlongs run in 1:07 3/5, faster
than the track record of 1:08, on the way to a final clocking of
1:21 for 7 furlongs. But there was no stopping Successful Appeal at
Turfway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a little father back, but he went to the
leaders on his own,'' said Prado. ``He took the lead early in the
stretch, and I hadn't even asked him. He found another gear and
went right past them.''
</P>
<P>
   Five Star Day, trained by Beau Greely, has raced only six times
and remains extremely promising. ``They kept pressing him, and
wouldn't let him get away, and he got a little bit tired,'' said
Alex Solis, who rode Five Star Day, a 3-year-old son of Carson
City. ``But my colt is maturing with every start, and I'm not the
least bit disappointed in him. He's right on schedule for the
Breeders' Cup (Nov. 6 at Gulfsteam Park).''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Arroyo may return Wednesday &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Apprentice jockey Norberto Arroyo Jr. escaped serious injury in
a fall during the seventh race at Suffolk Downs Sunday, and he
hopes to return to riding Wednesday. Arroyo was aboard J.J.'s
Tarjoner when his mount was bumped while contending for the lead in
the early going of the 5-furlong sprint over grass. The horse lost
his action, and Arroyo was tossed off, taking a frightening tumble.
Arroyo was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital but released
Sunday night after X-rays proved negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very lucky,'' said Max Hall, the agent for the
20-year-old Arroyo. ``He's just real sore in the shoulder area, but
he should be back soon, and we're pointing for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He landed on his shoulder at the point of impact. We were
afraid he had broken his collarbone or dislocated his shoulder, but
the X-rays said he was OK. He's young, and he heals fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo won 14 races at Rockingham Park during the just-concluded
meeting, and Hall is hoping he'll have an outstanding meet at
Suffolk. ``I'm expecting big things from him,'' he said. ``He has a
very bright future.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the stewards Monday suspended jockey Gary Birzer,
whose mount, Amborse Express, hit J.J.'s Tarjoner from the outside,
for 10 days ``for careless riding, causing interference, impeding
another horse, which resulted in the fall of another jockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Birzer's suspension will run from Thursday through Oct. 9,
inclusive. Birzer, who has ridden at Fonner Park in Nebraska and
the Woodlands in Kansas, had just switched his tack to Suffolk.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Picking up $100,000
</P>
<P>
   Patrons will have a chance to qualify for an ultimate prize of
$100,000, as Suffolk Downs hosts a preliminary round of the
National Handicapping Contest Saturday. The contest is sponsored by
the Daily Racing Form and the National Thoroughbred Racing
Association, with the finals set for Jan. 7-8 at the MGM Grand
hotel in Las Vegas. The qualifying round consists of win wagering
only on the live Suffolk card, with bets coming from a mythical
bankroll of $1,000. Money can be managed as the players choose, and
they may bet as many as nine races or as few as one. The top four
scorers will each win a trip to Las Vegas for the finals. There is
a $2 fee to enter.

   BOSTON _ The twentysomething guy at the restaurant Sunday night
spoke for multitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even a golf fan,'' he said, ``but I couldn't stop
watching.''
</P>
<P>
   The overnight ratings revealed that when Justin Leonard made the
fateful 45-foot putt on the 17th hole, a staggering 42 percent of
all Greater Boston TV sets were tuned into the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The tall, well-dressed guy with a TV credential clutched his
little American flag as he watched Leonard make the big putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fantastic,'' said Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Diehard golf fans, casual golf fans, and non-golf fans all found
themselves swept up in Sunday afternoon's Ryder Cup excitement.
What took place at that expanse of heavenly Brookline real estate
reminded us why so many millions worldwide satisfy a special
emotional need through organized sport. There is a potential
exhilaration in human-vs.-human competition that simply makes one
feel alive. People not tuned into sport can lead very fulfilling
lives, but there is a certain feeling inherent in sports
competition that is simply not replicated in any other form of
human endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, the Ryder Cup was a polite, one-sided golfing
competition matching the best United States players against the
best players from Britain and Ireland. The United States so
dominated the competition that, in order to save the event from
utter redundancy, the opposing team was expanded in 1979 to include
players from any country in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The USA continued with resounding victories in 1979 and 1981,
but things began to change in 1983. In the last nine Ryder Cups,
the tally is 4-4-1, and the Europeans actually lead in total
points, 128-124. By any measure, the Ryder Cup now stands for
legitimate sporting competition.
</P>
<P>
   Few outside what was then the tight little world of golf cared
until the Americans started losing. Then came the '90s, and the
exponential growth of sports/business marriages. Golf has always
catered to a high-end clientele _ check out the ads on any Sunday
PGA Tour telecast _ and so it was only natural that as general
interest in the sport grew, the Ryder Cup, the premier
international golf competition, would become a huge marketing
enterprise, culminating in the appalling display of spending for
spending's sake we had on view at The Country Club this past week.
</P>
<P>
   As the shadows fell on one of the truly great golf courses in
the world late Sunday afternoon, however, no one was obsessing any
longer about the corporate excess, and what real good might have
been done with all those loose dollars being strewn around town
during the week. No, 100 percent of the interest was where we'd all
like to think it should be _ on the 24 superb players in question
and their fierce, dignified competition.
</P>
<P>
   There was a reason that Hall of Famers like John Havlicek, Dave
DeBusschere, George Brett, and, of course, Jordan could think of no
other place they'd rather be at that moment than at The Country
Club. Their very presence made a mockery of the golf mockers. These
superb athletes, and countless others of their ilk, have tried to
master this fiendish sport and have not been able to do so. It is
quite possible that no man on the planet who is not being paid to
do so has spent more time on the golf course in the past two years
than Jordan, arguably as fine a pure athlete as our society has
ever produced. He has not come close to being a truly accomplished
golfer. He is better than most people, but he is to the 24 men he
was watching Sunday as a second-division Italian League basketball
player is to him.
</P>
<P>
   To play this sport well, a man must have well-rounded golfing
skills and a man must be able to conquer his nerves. And the
crucible in the sport is the Ryder Cup, where what you do matters,
not just to you but to 11 other men, as well. Even the best players
find that this extra element creates exponentially more pressure on
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the most emotional thing I've ever gone through in
golf,'' said Hal Sutton, who, at age 41, and with a personally
tumultuous 12 years between Ryder Cup appearances, was the
consensus team MVP by winning 3 1/2 points. ``Saturday night, I
prayed for peace of mind, and I had it on Sunday. And when it was
over, I had to fight back tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Any great golfer is a Sunday player, because that is the day
when the money is made. What we all saw two days ago was a group of
inspired Sunday players demonstrating to both the Europeans and the
gallery just who they are. They were hitting greens they weren't
hitting on Friday and Saturday and sinking putts from Cleveland
Circle and the Chestnut Hill Mall.
</P>
<P>
   As athletes and competitors, they had a lot to prove. They knew
what was being written and said (mostly by NBC's Johnny Miller)
about them. They knew what the Europeans thought of them. They
simply made up their minds to get that Cup back, if only so they
could live with themselves. Small wonder, therefore, that they
plain and simple lost it on the 17th when Leonard sank his historic
putt.
</P>
<P>
   Was it a breach of golf's rigid decorum to celebrate before Jose
Maria Olazabal was able to attempt a 20-footer that could have tied
the match and set up a dramatic 18th hole? Without question. But
was it a sin against mankind, and was it, as some Europeans
suggested, ``disgusting''? Oh, please. Some Americans might
consider the aggravatingly slow play of most Europeans
``disgusting.'' And was it the reason the noble Spaniard missed the
lengthy putt? Absolutely not.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hear it for Tom Lehman and Davis Love III, each of whom
spoke the truth by accusing all the Europeans _ players,
journalists, and fans alike _ of having predictably short memories.
The atmosphere at Valderrama two years ago wasn't exactly warm and
fuzzy for the Americans. Anyone who has ever been privileged to see
any American team in action elsewhere, whether it's the Olympics,
the World Championships, or any individual international
competition, knows that the fan behavior is often beyond appalling
and the overall conditions are so stacked against Americans that to
suggest otherwise is simply laughable.
</P>
<P>
   The European players should be flattered. The only reason the
Americans were so full of spontaneous emotion was that the Euros
were so damn hard to beat.
</P>
<P>
   For so long the idea of the Ryder Cup coming right here was an
abstract. The one thing we all assumed was that anything written
beforehand would be exaggerated, because events like this almost
never live up to their billing. How wonderfully rare and precious
as sports fans it is to be proven wrong on such a fundamental
issue.
</P>
<P>
   What took place on Sunday afternoon might go down as the best
day of sport competition that will take place
(itals)anywhere(unitals) this calendar year. Twenty-four
accomplished artists made some sticks and a few dimpled little
balls into instruments that manipulated our emotions. It all
happened right here, and on a spectacular afternoon that also made
nature an active contributor to the drama.
</P>
<P>
   Really. How lucky can we get?

GLENN WORKS ON HIS SNAGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Terry Glenn is beyond wanting to have big games. He's
now into perfection. On the 45-yard pass he caught to set up the
Patriots' only touchdown in their 16-14 win over the Giants Sunday
night, he wished that he didn't have to leap for the ball, that he
could have stayed on his feet and gone in for the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great call by (Ernie) Zampese,'' said Glenn Monday.
``We were around midfield and they were in a Cover-2. They were
pressing us and Drew (Bledsoe) did a quick count and Shawn
(Jefferson) and I ran a double post. Shawn was running it to the
inside and I was running it to the outside. I ran and took the
safety out of deep post and he jumped on Shawn and Drew made a
great, great throw. I saw it leave his hand and as it made its way
through the crowd, I said, `I've got to catch this ball.' I wish I
didn't have to leave my feet because I would have gone in.''
</P>
<P>
   So it has now come down to perfecting these big plays for Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   His health is there. His focus is there.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be, for evey Sunday is a war against another
cornerback or safety. Usually he's double-teamed, but on Sunday
night he was getting hacked by Jason Sehorn, the former All-Pro
corner, and he didn't like it one bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get past 5 yards you can't touch me, but he was
getting away with it a lot,'' said Glenn. ``At one point I went to
the ref. I'm usually not a big complainer when I'm on field because
I like to be physical as well, but he starts to chuck you beyond
that 5 yards and it's not legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really bothered me is if they let him get away with that
stuff in our stadium, what's he going to get away with in his?''
</P>
<P>
   One time Glenn got knocked off his feet _ well beyond the 5-yard
area, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to run a crossing route,'' said Glenn. ``I know I
was over the 5-yard area and the guy just pushed. That's a weak
play. If you can't play the game without pushing and shoving and
grabbing and cheating, maybe you shouldn't be out there. At least
it tells me one thing: He can't stay with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn knew that Sehorn was playing for the first time since the
1997 season (because of injuries) and wanted to take advantage, but
he also wanted to do it within the confines of the offense Zampese
had designed for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said he started beating Sehorn on slants and Sehorn was
``shaded to my outside because he didn't want me to get outside.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Glenn got the better of it.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there may not be a better receiver in the AFC,
perhaps the game. Glenn has caught 19 passes and he came within 5
yards of having his third consecutive 100-yard game.
</P>
<P>
   But the thing he wants to emphasize is that the team has won
three straight without being at its best yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 3-0, but we haven't played our best game yet,'' said
Glenn. ``We hope it'll come very soon _ next week, maybe. But it's
way too early to start thinking we're a great team. I hope my
teammates feel the same way. We're not getting too high on it. It's
so early that you can still go 3-13 if we don't keep our
composure.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn likes the fact that the offense doesn't crawl into a shell
when trailing. The Patriots have been down in all three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very important that we always be the ones who are
attacking,'' said Glenn. ``You should counterattack them at all
cost. They should be trying to stop you from doing what you want to
do. We were doing that even Sunday night. The deep post route was
an example of going right at them even though we wanted to run the
ball. As a wide receiver you want to pass the ball a lot, but when
you're running game is working, you've got to keep with it because
it can set up the pass and set up a play like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pete Carroll had called the Giants game a potential trap
for the Patriots, and Glenn said Sunday's matchup against the
Browns has all the makings of one as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fell into it at St. Louis last year,'' said Glenn.
``Everybody's telling us it's a game we'll win easy, and when we
got down there, we got our butts worked over. We have to have our
feet on the ground and approach it like we approached the Giants
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think we've been involved in enough of these games that
we'll prepare hard and take it like any other strong NFL opponent.
Chris Palmer was a good coordinator and he did a great job here
with the quarterbacks. He gave me a couple of pointers, too. So
he's a guy we know and we can't let that affect the way we play.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Sunday night's game, Glenn was doing a bit of sneak
preview work on the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a good secondary,'' said Glenn. ``Guys like Corey
Fuller, Marquez Pope, Antonio Langham, they're pretty good. We have
to stay in our attack mode and take it right at them. That's what
we do best, I think.''

MACRO EVENT WAS A MICROCOSM

<TEXT>
<P>
   (itals)Note to all readers: After you finish this story, I would
appreciate it if you would contact your Nobel Prize sources and put
in a good word for me. Thanks. Knew I could count on you. See you
at my Nobel party.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   _ M.H.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since Ryder Cup week changed my life, I am now ready to change
the world. If that surprises you, imagine how I feel. Until last
week, my ultimate goal was to make the cover of Time and the
National Enquirer in the same week. Now I am campaigning for a
prize that has been awarded to the likes of Albert Einstein, Toni
Morrison, and my man the Dalai Lama. This wouldn't have been
possible without my week of golf at The Country Club in Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein's theory: E (EQ) mc squared.
</P>
<P>
   My theory: All square.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, I can highlight all aspects of American culture
simply by sharing my golf week, a week that ended with the 12-man
American team winning the 33d Ryder Cup from Europe, 14 1/2-13 1/2.
Through the All Square Theory (AST), you can learn about American
language, facial expressions, business, love, triumph, golf,
heroism, contradiction, cuisine, and celebration _ all while
wearing your golf shoes.
</P>
<P>
   So you will understand how Michael Jordan voluntarily sat under
a tree with George Bush, even though Jordan didn't want to be near
the former president while he was in the White House. You will know
why a nearly intoxicated man named Fluff stumbled out of the
clubhouse Sunday, kissed a female police officer, and was not
arrested. You will know why I, like thousands of golf fans in the
area, will no longer be able to function without the BBC. You will
even understand how some parking lot attendants were able to charge
_ and get _ $75 for parking spaces, even though you can park
illegally and get a ticket for the same price.
</P>
<P>
   If you let me tell you about the most recent Ryder Cup, you will
understand American culture. (Aside to high school and college
students: I'm working on getting the weeklong AST factored into
curricula so you can get credit for participation.) So, please,
read on and remember our deal. You'll make that Nobel call for me,
right? And when you come to the party, don't bring any gifts. Just
come with your clubs and we'll play 36.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The man's name is Len and he is not quite an American prophet.
He is from southeast London. He wears a plastic hat emblazoned with
the flag of Great Britain. His shirt says, ``London to Boston _
Ryder Cup.'' I sit next to Len and eight of his friends, all of
them wearing identical shirts and hats. They are jubilant as we
ride a bus from The Country Club to the Forest Hills T stop
Saturday night. Europe has a 10-6 lead over the Americans. To lose
the Cup, the Europeans will have to drop about 75 percent of their
matches the next day. That is so unlikely that Len and his friends
are singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stand up if you love Eur-ope!'' one of them sings, standing up
as he does it. Len stands up and sings, too. Eventually he sits
down again and we talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were around American fans all day,'' Len says, ``and
everybody was all right. We said things to each other, but it was
all good-natured.''
</P>
<P>
   I should have warned Len: Many American sports fans, especially
in the East, are Dobermans. There are moments when they are serene,
but there is always the chance that they will turn on you. When
their teams trail badly, they often attack those they are rooting
for; when their teams are close, they remain in attack mode, but
the target becomes the opposition and opposing fans. If the
American team wins, the fans eventually feel a sense of remorse for
their behavior and overcompensate by apologizing too much. But the
contradiction is that it is not truly malicious; it just looks and
sounds that way. Especially when you see a guy with a beer in one
hand, a miniature flag in the other, foaming at the mouth, and
screaming, ``Go home, Euro.'' The same heckler could see a European
player at a restaurant and have a pleasant conversation with him.
</P>
<P>
   How could I explain all of that to Big Len? He was having too
much fun. And I loved listening to him speak. I wasn't the only one
fascinated with the British accent.
</P>
<P>
   Many people will tell you that the best investment of the week
cost $12. That was the price for a small transistor radio, which
many used to listen to the BBC broadcast of the Ryder Cup. Even
now, I am fighting the urge to use words such as ``snappy,''
``smashing,'' and ``marvelous.'' And anytime someone mentions Colin
Montgomerie, I want to shout, ``Well struck, Monty!'' If I can't
win the Nobel Prize, I'd like to have my own sports talk show on
BBC. The BBC rules.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Len and Montgomerie would eventually hear American words
that are rarely broadcast on BBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even repeat them to you,'' Montgomerie said Sunday
night. ``Some of the things said out there were disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Some, but not all. On Sunday, a couple of Americans had a
conversation about Andrew Coltart's lost ball on No. 9. They said
it should have never been lost. And on the BBC, American
broadcaster Charlie Jones apologized on behalf of all Americans for
rude members of the gallery and the lost ball.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OK, ready to test out the theories?
</P>
<P>
   1. Golf events may be for the rich, but you can get rich if
you're in the right place.
</P>
<P>
   That was true for anyone living in the Brookline area. Some lots
near Cleveland Circle charged $20 for parking. The closer you got
to The Country Club, the higher the prices went, topping off at
$75.
</P>
<P>
   2. The majority of American men like blondes.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, this is not a judgment, just an observation. From
Tiger Woods to Phil Mickelson to captain Ben Crenshaw, the
companions/wives were blonde.
</P>
<P>
   3. To be American is to be contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, I headed toward the Boston Globe tent. I wore a Globe
press pass. It didn't matter; I was denied by a security guard.
Imagine: Globe employee barred from Globe tent. ``Sorry,'' said the
guard, ``can't let you in.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, Jordan sat under a tree, chatted with President
Bush and his wife, Barbara, and watched Woods putt on No. 11. When
he played for the Bulls, Jordan made it known that he didn't want
to be close to Bush. A few days ago, he joked with him and sat next
to him. Keep in mind that there is no judgment in that statement,
just an example of what it means to be an American. Bush, a staunch
opponent of hardcore rap music, once had dinner with a member of
the controversial rap group N.W.A.
</P>
<P>
   4. If you think it is the way it ``should be,'' it probably will
not be.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston paid a total of $1 million for its tent and to rent
out Charles River CC. You wonder what would happen if it spent $1
million _ obviously a pittance _ on a few families that it rejected
for home loans.
</P>
<P>
   5. Sometimes it's OK to be nearly drunk in front of the cops and
to kiss them, too.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't happen often. But after the US completed its
stunning comeback, caddie Fluff Cowan was heading toward the area
used for closing ceremonies. He went over to a fan who was holding
a beer and yelling, ``God bless the USA.'' Cowan gave him a
high-five. He then walked down a path that was roped off and
guarded by police. He reversed his direction and kissed a female
officer on her cheek. She laughed and shook her head.
</P>
<P>
   6. Americans love comebacks and politics, and often draw their
inspiration from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After Justin Leonard made a 45-foot putt to clinch a half-point
for the US and, eventually the Ryder Cup, he was mobbed around the
17th green. The Americans reacted on 17 as if they were members of
a football team, celebrating a win over State U. Later, after fans
waved American flags and chanted ``USA,'' Crenshaw (a Texan) talked
about what led to his team's revival.
</P>
<P>
   The captain said he called on Texas Gov. George W. Bush to talk
with the team. The governor read a speech from the 1800s _ a speech
given at the Alamo, which is in San Antonio. Which, of course, is
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful speech,'' Crenshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked how he came to know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every little kid in Texas knows about the Alamo,'' he
answered.
</P>
<P>
   7. Never fret over the menu at an American party: Have
hamburgers and hot dogs available and you'll satisfy three-quarters
of the people.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was that the case at The Country Club, but the burgers
were $5.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday, at about 12:30 a.m., a few Europeans stood outside
the Four Seasons Hotel _ where the teams were staying _ and sang a
few songs. The night before, caddies from both countries did the
same thing at the Brookline Holiday Inn. On Sunday afternoon, there
were complaints of disgusting behavior all around. By early Monday
morning, some of the same people who leveled the charges were
drinking together. That, friends, is American golf.
</P>
<P>
   All square?

Cultural Revolution), and the great national savior has diminished.

   WRITING-TEST _ The writing skills of public school
eighth-graders are above the national average in Texas and

Carolina, and lower than the national average in Florida, according
to an embargoed copy of a NAEP report on the biggest writing test
in U.S. history, which the Department of Education is to release at
11 a.m. Tuesday 9/28. Since Ohio is one of the 15 states that
declined to pay extra for a large enough sample to get state-level
results, it will get a national lede. Also of interest to many Cox
states, Department of Defense schools, both stateside and overseas,
had above-average writing scores. On the national level, test
results cover grades 4, 8 and 12 in public and private schools.
Significance: Some writing experts lament that only about
one-fourth scored nationally at proficient or advanced level, while
others note happily thatmore than 80 percent scored at the basic,

HURRICANES NEED STIRRING UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe East Carolina should join the Big East. Then again maybe
not. After Saturday's improbable 27-23 victory over Miami, the
Pirates are 5-0 overall and 2-0 vs. Big East teams (the other win
was against West Virginia).
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes coach Butch Davis has two weeks to rebuild his team's
confidence for a trip to Tallahassee to face No. 1 Florida State
Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disappointed,'' said Davis in Monday's weekly Big East
conference call. ``Very disappointed. We missed an awful lot of
opportunities in the first half. And those kind of things almost
always come back and haunt you.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more surprising was the way the Hurricanes lost, giving up
a fourth-quarter lead. It was only the second time in 157 games
that Miami has lost after being ahead after three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   After this, which followed the last-minute loss to Penn State in
the Orange Bowl two weeks ago, Davis will have to rebuild the
psyche of his team.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A mountain of woes
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia, coming off a 30-7 loss to Syracuse, remains in
the doldrums. ``We're killing ourselves as a team,'' said coach Don
Nehlen, who now must worry about seeing Navy's option offense
Saturday. ``We're making too many mistakes.'' The last time West
Virginia started 1-3 was 1994, when it rebounded to win six of its
next seven games and earn a bowl bid . . . Virginia Tech continues
to rise in the rankings, jumping to seventh in the coaches' poll
and eighth in the writers' poll, the highest it has ever been
ranked. It still remains the team to beat in the Big East. ``I'm
not too worried about where we are (in the polls),'' said Tech
coach Frank Beamer, whose team takes on state rival Virginia
Saturday. ``We're coming along,'' said Beamer, ever so cautious.
``We have to be more consistent on offense.'' . . . One good note
for Miami: True freshman running back Clinton Portis made his first
career start against East Carolina and rushed for 147 yards on 27
carries, the most rushing yards ever for a true freshman . . .
Pittsburgh, which was idle last week, hosts Temple Saturday. At
2-1, the Panthers already have matched their win total of a year
ago . . . Temple continues to have problems scoring. After
Saturday's 34-0 rout by Marshall, the Owls are 0-4 and have scored
a total of 15 points this season . . . Not much better off is
Rutgers (0-3), which has yet to lead for a single second this
season . . . One of the reasons Pittsburgh has won two of its first
three is its ability to protect quarterback John Turman. A year
ago, Pittsburgh had allowed 19 sacks in three games. This season,
that total is three, best in the Big East . . . Boston College has
a chance to go 4-0 for only the second time since 1992 . . . When
Syracuse faces Tulane Saturday, it will be Paul Pasqualoni's 100th
game as coach of the Orangemen. During his tenure, Syracuse has
averaged 8.5 wins per season.

BIOGRAPHY OF `DUTCH' STIRS DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Resending)  
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As a first-time visitor to Ronald Reagan's museum
and a longtime fan of the president, Dorothy McCallum had a stern
warning for the author of the long-awaited biography, ``Dutch: A
Memoir of Ronald Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He better write everything good. He was the best we ever
had,'' said the 77-year-old Whittier resident, who recalled
listening to Reagan call football games on the radio during the
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the release of the Reagan biography Thursday,
controversy is swirling around author Edmund Morris, the
Pulitzer-prize winning biographer of Theodore Roosevelt who has
been working on ``Dutch'' since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts in Newsweek and interviews with Morris have created a
stir about the book on at least two counts: Morris created
fictional meetings with the former president in his early years;
and he described Reagan as ``an apparent airhead,'' saying he was
``distressed by the relentless banality, not to say incoherence, of
the president's replies in interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like him mentioning that,'' said McCallum's brother,
Edward Dalton, 76, as he toured the Presidential Library and
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like anything, you're going to have some negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely lifted us up. We were suffering from Vietnam,
and he made people proud of America again.''
</P>
<P>
   While Morris wrote lovingly about the man who he said exhibits
``aggression without hostility, ego without vanity, superiority
without snobbery,'' he also referred to his ``encyclopedic
ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   Some at the museum understood how Morris reached that conclusion
after enjoying extensive access to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me he was never known for his intellect,'' said
Lorene Robbins, 62, of Winnetka, visiting the museum with her
husband and two friends from Denver. ``Nobody seemed to understand
his mind or his thinking process.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she hated to lose him as governor of California, but
called Reagan a ``mediocre'' president, saying ``there were many
that were much better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception was that he did better than he actually did,''
added her friend, Judy Butterfield, 61, of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Saucier, spokeswoman for the Reagan Presidential
Foundation, which funds the museum, said it has no official
position on the book, and has not decided whether to carry it in
the gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   That suits museum visitor Greg Voetsch Jr., 41, just fine. He
said he has no interest in the book, even though he admires the man
who he said brought down the Berlin Wall and elevated America
during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I want to read a biography about somebody, I want to read
about their life, not what the author wants to insert himself,'' he
said. ``I probably won't buy it, I won't read it.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Dachs, 60, and his wife, Monica, were visiting the museum
with their son, Dirk, a 34-year-old writer from Glendale. The
Dachses weren't familiar with the biography, but are such Reagan
fans that the museum was their only must-see in their three-day
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything he did was for the good of the country,'' Howard
Dachs said. ``What was Iran-Contra about? It was about fighting
communism, not his personal gain.''
</P>
<P>
   He also recalled a story about Reagan refusing to enter the Oval
Office without a coat and tie, to maintain its dignity, which Dachs
compared to President Clinton's ``dropping his pants in the Oval
Office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would sooner have Reagan in the White House with
Alzheimer's,'' he said, ``than what we have in there now, with his
disease.''

ANOTHER CLOSE CALL FOR THE NINERS' QUARTERBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ According to the recipient, this was Concussion
Lite, a quick hit, a flash of pain and disorientation, and then
back to normalcy. Steve Young said he didn't feel groggy this time.
He didn't feel nauseated, either.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could say the same thing. When the ABC cameras showed
him lying on the ground Monday night during the San Francisco
49ers' 24-10 victory at Arizona, half-curled up on his side, eyes
closed behind his face mask, body completely motionless, my stomach
roiled.
</P>
<P>
   Is there such a thing as a mild concussion? Medically, yes.
Emotionally, for an audience watching an athlete imitate a corpse,
even for a few seconds, the answer is no.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Deese, the 49ers' multipurpose offensive lineman, was on
the field when two blitzing Arizona Cardinals knocked Young out.
``I didn't see him move, so I said, `Hey, are you all right?' and
he didn't answer,'' Deese said. ``But it couldn't have been very
long. The trainers came out and said `Steve?' And he said:
`Yeah.'''
</P>
<P>
   Deese once watched a high school opponent die on the football
field _ a defensive tackle who ran into the pile, on an ordinary
play. ``Then he came out and collapsed, and he never got up
again,'' Deese said. ``Any time you see something like that, it's
frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   He was speaking as a football player, as someone who has seen a
lot of fallen colleagues. The problem with football players _ and
the beauty of them _ is that they take agony for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Ask any of the 49ers to recall the worst moment they've seen in
defensive tackle Bryant Young's career, and they're sure to say the
Monday night last year when he snapped his leg and nearly lost his
career. It was a hideous moment, but for me, the worst was when he
passed out at Lambeau Field almost three years ago and didn't move.
For a second, I thought he was dead.
</P>
<P>
   For another second, I thought he might be paralyzed from the
neck down. By comparison, last year's broken leg seemed mild.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing that happens to the head or spine can really be
called ``mild.'' Steve Young says he understands that now, better
than in his foolhardy past, when he begged to be let back into a
game against Tampa Bay after his third concussion in 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get less cavalier about it (as you get older),'' the
quarterback said. He has plans for his retirement. He's even
willing to use the word now, to talk about possibly running a
legal-aid foundation, or an Internet company, or both. ``When I
retire, it's going to be wonderful. I don't want any ill effects.''
</P>
<P>
   But he isn't his own best guardian. He has a neurologist he
trusts. Just as important, he has a coach who has wised up a lot
since that dreadful day in Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mariucci, the 49ers coach, put Young back in that game two
years ago. It was his first game as a head coach in the NFL, and he
didn't know how to say no. This time, he did. When the quarterback
didn't get up, Mariucci didn't care that Young recovered his wits
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to get up right away,'' Mariucci said. ``He was
saying `Get me up, get me up, get me up.' Everybody was keeping him
down. He didn't want to make a scene. He didn't want to
overdramatize anything.''
</P>
<P>
   They let Young up, but Mariucci didn't let him back into the
game, even when the quarterback asked. The coach knew almost
immediately that he wouldn't take that chance. He wanted to be
conservative. He said that he told the team doctor as much and that
he told Young that ``I love him too much to put him back in.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers were leading 17-0 at the time, so the decision seemed
easy then. But in the second half, when the offense sputtered and
Arizona pulled to within a touchdown, Mariucci said he never
wavered. ``He was not going back in under any circumstances,
whether we were winning or losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the decisions he has made as a head coach, the ones that
he second-guesses the most are the ones that put Young back into
the Tampa Bay game and Jerry Rice back on the field 3 1/2 months
after he tore his anterior cruciate ligament in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   This concussion could have presented more of a dilemma. Young
did seem remarkably alert afterward, and during the first half
Monday night, he looked more precise and controlled than in the
Niners' two previous games. He didn't force things. He got decent
protection. And he opened the game with some vintage passes to
Rice.
</P>
<P>
   There was virtually no hint of the battering he took a week ago
from the Saints. He seemed refreshed. And at least once, he seemed
adolescently reckless. Scrambling up the middle, he passed the
first-down marker, then kept going, refusing to slide to safety.
Instead, he heaved himself head-first into a cluster of Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that because the offense had sputtered the last two
weeks, he had promised himself that ``we were going to move the
ball this week, no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Young made another promise. If his body
needs to retire, ``I think I'll know,'' he said, slowly,
thoughtfully.
</P>
<P>
   But will he? Can a man vow to do anything to move a football,
even throw his head into a play that has already yielded a first
down, and just as fervently commit to taking care of himself?
</P>
<P>
   I don't trust Young on that second promise. He wouldn't even say
that he was knocked out on Monday night. He said he had his eyes
closed because he was ``trying to find myself.''
</P>
<P>
   So who decides how much is too much? Doctors can do some of the
work, but they can be hampered by a patient who gives rosy accounts
of his symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The news media? We all thought Young was finished in 1996, when
his head took two terrible blows over two weeks. Last season, at
age 37, he was playing some of the best football of his career.
</P>
<P>
   The coach? He knows how much his quarterback despises the
melodrama that envelopes every bashing he takes. When someone asked
Mariucci whether Young's future flashed before his eyes on that
horrible play Monday night, he said ``no,'' in true, stoic football
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   A second later, he realized how ridiculous that sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said, changing his answer, no longer pretending. He
said he saw what everyone else saw, what Young couldn't _ or
wouldn't _ see. The quarterback is too tough. We just might feel
his pain more than he does.

restaurant, celebrated New Year's Eve in characteristic style last
year: it opened early and kept going until 5 a.m. As night turned
to dawn, the restaurant remained packed. And how will Jo Jo mark
the New Year's Eve ushering in the next millennium? By shutting
down for the night. And that is not unusual. While many restaurants
are planning extravagantly prepared and stratospherically priced
meals to mark the millennium, a growing number of New York's best

NEW STUDIES LINK ANTIBIOTICS IN FOOD TO DRUG RESISTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Studies from the United States and Europe
support the conclusion that the widespread use of antibiotics in
livestock feed is leading to drug-resistant disease in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Salmonella and campylobacter, two food-borne organisms that
sicken millions of people a year but rarely kill, are increasingly
turning up resistant to antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   And studies of samples of human stools and grocery-store
chickens in the United States found a significant proportion
containing bacteria resistant to a new class of medicine designed
to fight off microbes that have grown impervious to the treatment
of last resort, vancomycin.
</P>
<P>
   The new human drug, which health officials hope will succeed
where others have failed, is similar to virginiamycin, an
antibiotic that has been used in chicken feed for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The fear, said the authors of the study, is that continued use
of virginiamycin in animal feed could render the new human drug
ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, along with several other studies focusing on the
development of drug-resistant microbes in animals, were presented
Monday at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and
Chemotherapy in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antibiotic-resistant bacteria in humans _ does it come from
animals? The answer is yes,'' said Stephen F. Sundlof of the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The agency believes the issue is of major concern, Sundlof said,
and is planning meetings over the next several months to develop a
way to regulate the use of antibiotics in animals to lessen the
chances of exacerbating the problem of drug-resistant diseases in
humans.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union banned four antibiotics this summer from use
in livestock feed, and is considering banning three others because
of fears the antibiotics will contribute to the spread of human
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Still, specialists say the overuse of antibiotics to treat
people has contributed far more to what is fast becoming a major
public health issue: Microbes that have been inadvertently selected
to survive attacks by most or all anti-bacterial drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are pointing the finger at animals as the source of the
problem when animals are a tiny portion of the human problem as a
whole,'' said Robin Bywater, a consultant to Pfizer, which makes
virginiamycin, one of the drugs banned by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Virginiamycin, he said, has been used in animal feed for 25
years and hasn't created a resistance problem. And, Bywater said,
even the diseases that have been associated with animal-to-human
drug resistance are not the type that cause major illnesses such as
tuberculosis or pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   But the fears of serious consequences are there. While
physicians worldwide are being urged to take steps to cut down on
use of antibiotics, attention is also turning to farmers, who
frequently use antibiotics in livestock feed to promote growth.
</P>
<P>
   By killing off much of the bacteria in the stomach, antibiotics
allow animals to absorb more food and thus grow larger with less
feed.
</P>
<P>
   A Danish study presented Monday found that chicken farmers in
Denmark, who stopped using antibiotics in feed in 1995, did just as
well or better after eliminating drugs in the food.
</P>
<P>
   The chickens ate slightly more, but also weighed slightly more
at the same point in development. Meanwhile, farmers saved money by
not buying antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Altogether, it has not been an economic disaster for the
farmer,'' said Hanne-Dorthe Emborg, the principal author of the
study.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta, researchers looked at the increasing prevalence of
salmonella that is resistant to ceftriaxone, an antibiotic commonly
used to treat salmonella in children.
</P>
<P>
   Resistance had been extremely rare _ only three cases reported
in the United States before 1996. But by 1998 cases had increased
tenfold. Nine of 12 patients identified in the study as having the
resistant strain were interviewed and none had taken antibiotics
before coming down with the illness.
</P>
<P>
   However, three had visited a farm just before becoming ill and
one had drunk raw milk, said Eileen Dunne, a CDC epidemiologist and
the lead author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Ceftriaxone, used in humans, is very similar to ceftiofor, an
antibiotic used frequently with pigs and cows, she said. The human
drug is the primary means of treating salmonella in children, whose
less developed immune systems often have a hard time fighting it
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing the ability to use this anti-microbial is a problem,''
she said. The only alternatives are expensive, broad-spectrum drugs
that kill everything, and lead to unwanted side effects.

A BALANCING ACT LEADS TO A VARIETY OF QUICK BREADS 
</HEADLINE>
   This is the third of eight columns by Amy Scherber of Amy's Bread
in Manhattan. These columns are being written with Dorie
Greenspan.  
(jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I count my plum-honey quick-bread recipe as my first
professional culinary triumph _ and try to forget that it was
developed in a state of panic. I was a college student and had been
hired as the summer cook and housekeeper for a family that did not
have a clue how inexperienced I was. I listened as I was told that
I would be responsible for lunches, dinners and fresh baked sweets
for breakfast, then ran to the library to read every cookbook.
Thirty cookbooks and a little practice later, I learned the
quick-bread secret: get the balance between the wet and dry
ingredients right and you can vary the fruits, nuts and spices with
abandon. This meant I could make a different quick bread every day,
and I did.
</P>
<P>
   Since quick breads are called ``quick'' because they are
leavened with baking powder, not slow-acting yeast, check your
baking powder supply _ and the expiration date on the tin _ before
you start. Use double-acting baking powder, which releases its
first round of leavening power when it comes in contact with
moisture, and its second when it is exposed to the oven's heat.
</P>
<P>
   Most quick breads, including mine, are put together using the
one-two method: One set of ingredients, the wet, is added to a
second set, the dry, in a bowl large enough to hold everything in
the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   I use unbleached all-purpose flour as the basic dry ingredient
because it produces a light, tender texture. Sometimes I add a
touch of whole wheat flour for its fragrance, but for fiber and
toothsomeness, I prefer to round out the flour with oats. I have
tried quick-cooking and instant oats and have been disappointed
with both: they dissolve into the batter. But old-fashioned oats,
with their big, puffy flakes, have staying power. In fact, their
staying power is so strong that I soak them for a few minutes in
milk before mixing them into the batter.
</P>
<P>
   While the oats are soaking, I mix together the other wet
ingredients. In this recipe, I use milk for its sweet flavor, but
when you are experimenting on your own, you might substitute fruit
juice or buttermilk. Similarly, I've chosen honey as the sweetener
because I like the way it goes with so many kinds of fruit, but you
can use sugar or even maple syrup. The eggs are there partly for
additional leavening, partly for moisture, but mostly for richness
and body, and so they should not be tampered with. Nor should you
change the vegetable oil, which helps give the quick bread its
characteristic moist, tender, not-too-tight structure.
</P>
<P>
   When the two sets of ingredients are ready, use a wooden spoon
or a rubber spatula to stir everything together gently with a few
quick strokes. It's crucial to the texture of the bread that you go
easy here. Barely mixed is better than fully combined. Next, add
the soaked oats and the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   (I use plums, which look especially beautiful because they add
bursts of color, but you can try any of the fruits in my
variations, or any of your choosing. You should have 14 ounces of
fresh or dried fruit, the optimum amount the batter can support,
and they should be cut into small pieces.)
</P>
<P>
   Working once again with a quick, light touch, stir in the fruit
and oats. If the mixture looks lumpy, that's fine.
</P>
<P>
   Like almost all loaf quick breads, this one needs almost an hour
in the oven. It's delicious at room temperature, and even better
the next day. Keep the cooled loaf well wrapped, and it will be
fine for about four days. It will also be fine if you freeze it for
a month. In fact, I never make just one loaf; I always double the
recipe and have one for now and one for later. The bake-and-freeze
method works perfectly with the plum-and-honey quick bread, as well
as with its three seasonal variations: orange-apricot-cardamom,
peach-cinnamon and pear-ginger.
</P>
<P>
   PLUMS-AND-HONEY QUICK BREAD
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   } cup old-fashioned (not quick-cooking) oats

</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   } cup honey
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   14 ounces black plums (about 3 large or 5 small), pitted and cut
into \-inch dice.
</P>
<P>
   1. Center a rack in the oven, and preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Oil 9-by-5-inch loaf pan.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a small bowl combine oats and { cup milk, and allow to
soak 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. In large bowl whisk together flour, baking powder, salt,
cinnamon and baking soda. In another bowl, whisk together remaining
{ cup milk, honey, 6 tablespoons oil and eggs. Pour liquid
ingredients over dry ones, and stir until partially moistened. Add
soaked oats and any milk remaining in the bowl and plums, and stir
gently until batter is moistened. Do not overmix. Pour into pan.
</P>
<P>
   4. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in
center of loaf comes out clean. Transfer to a cooling rack for 5
minutes, then unmold. Allow to cool to room temperature before
slicing. To store, wrap tightly in plastic wrap.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 1 loaf; 8 to 10 servings.

</P>
<P>
   The basic recipe can easily be varied with these substitutions.
</P>

LIKE PESTO, ONLY NEWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one ever has too many sauces for cold poached shrimp, but
tomato is a cliche and mayonnaise types are too creamy for me. By
this time every year I am even tired of pesto. But the pesto
variation taught to me by Deborah Madison, who wrote ``Vegetarian
Cooking for Everyone'' is a different story. It's based not on
basil but on marjoram, an unheralded herb that grows well in the
Northeast and can be found in good quantity almost anywhere fresh
herbs are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Madison's version is similar to a parsley-based sauce served
with the Italian dish capon magro, which is essentially a pile of
poached fish and vegetables. Her substitution of marjoram for
parsley reminded me that all Italian-style herb pastes are
essentially the same. A large quantity of a single herb is simply
pulverized with good olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper. (It
doesn't pay to use more than one type of herb; that only muddies
the flavor.) As with traditional pesto, the idea is to preserve,
intensify and complement the flavor of the herb, rather than to
transform or overwhelm it.
</P>
<P>
   Marjoram, with its earthy smokiness, is not easily overwhelmed
to begin with. It can absorb more than the usual amount of raw
garlic. Anchovies and capers provide a briny saltiness that reduces
the need for salt to an absolute minimum. And the little bit of
vinegar heightens the flavor, counteracting the heaviness of the
marjoram. The combination is wonderful, and it graces the cold
shrimp simply and perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Marjoram is related to and resembles oregano, but its flavor is
better. Oregano is a good but not perfect substitute in this pesto.
</P>
<P>
   As for the shrimp, you can buy them peeled, but shrimp poached
in their shells have more flavor, particularly if the cooking water
is salted. If you're going to peel the shrimp yourself, it pays to
buy larger shrimp and cut down on the work. Those labeled ```U-20''
(under 20 a pound) are nice to work with and to eat, and are
usually not prohibitively expensive.
</P>
<P>
   You can add other seasonings to the poaching liquid if you want;
the easiest is a handful of pickling mix, which usually contains
peppercorns, whole allspice, bay leaf and coriander and dill seeds.
Any or all of those spices, along with a couple of cloves of garlic
or a piece of onion, will subtly improve the flavor of the shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   COLD POACHED SHRIMP WITH MARJORAM PESTO
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds shrimp in the shell
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 cups marjoram, leaves and small stems only
</P>
<P>
   1 large or 2 small cloves garlic, peeled
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons red-wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   one-third cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon capers
</P>
<P>
   2 anchovy fillets, optional.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place shrimp in a saucepan with water to cover and a large
pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, and turn off the heat; let shrimp
sit in the water about 5 minutes, then rinse in cold water until
cool. Peel (and devein if you like), then arrange on a platter.
</P>
<P>
   2. Combine marjoram and garlic in a blender or small food
processor. Process until finely minced, scraping down sides with a
rubber spatula once or twice if necessary. Add vinegar and most of
the oil, and process until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   3. Add capers and anchovies, and pulse the machine on and off a
few times so that the capers and anchovies are minced but not
pureed.
</P>
<P>
   4. Stir in remaining oil, along with salt and pepper to taste.
Serve with cold shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>

   These are the general rules for making Italian-style herb
pastes:
</P>
<P>
   _Any herb is fair game, but the best are basil, parsley,
marjoram, oregano and mint.
</P>
<P>
   _Some oil, at least a couple of tablespoons, is needed for
creaminess. But some of the oil can be replaced by hot water.
</P>
<P>
   _Garlic, salt and pepper are almost always included.
</P>
<P>
   _Vinegar or other acidic liquids like lemon juice are optional.
</P>
<P>
   Other flavorings, always optional, include capers, anchovies,
pine nuts, chopped eggs, pitted olives or grated dry cheese like
Parmigiano-Reggiano or pecorino Romano.

3 MODERATELY PRICED WINES FOR AUTUMN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Winemakers are harvesting their grapes this month, their heads
full of ideas for crafting wines that will come to market in a year
or so. In the spirit of such forward thinking, what better time to
freshen your wine collection for the coming months?
</P>
<P>
   Here is a handsome trio _ reds from Italy, France and California
_ that will complement hearty autumn meals. And their merits
include their moderate prices.
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Antinori's Santa Cristina 1998, Tuscany, Italy. About
$9.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Once designated a Chianti Classico, Santa Cristina was dropped
down to a table wine in 1987. This did not mean that Santa
Cristina's quality had dropped, but that Chianti Classico's was
shooting up _ a win-win situation.
</P>
<P>
   The wine, which has been in the Antinori portfolio since 1946,
is named for a family vineyard in the Chianti region. The name of
the principal grape, sangiovese, was added to the label in 1991,
probably because the United States is a good market and Americans
love grape names on their wines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Antinori edged away from the classic Chianti blend by
substituting merlot for the canaiolo grape. The blend now is 90
percent sangiovese and 10 percent merlot.
</P>
<P>
   This is a simple, straightforward and very tasty wine. It's a
good buy and is widely available.
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Pellegrini Family Vineyards Pinot Noir 1997, Olivet
Lane Estate, Russian River Valley, California. About $20.(end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   As evidenced here, it's getting so that the title of some wines
is often as long _ if not as boring _ as the description. Actually,
this is a good thing. It shows that California winemakers and wine
drinkers have recognized that the vineyard is paramount, that all
the stainless steel gadgetry in a winery doesn't make much
difference if the grapes are not first-class.
</P>
<P>
   This wine has two things going for it. First, the grapes come
from the Pelligrinis' Olivet Lane Vineyard, which has provided
fruit for some spectacular wines, including some memorable Williams
&AMP; Selyem pinots that regularly turn up at auctions at staggering
prices. And it was made by Merry Edwards, a pinot noir expert who
knows how to bring the very best out in the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   At 13.8 percent alcohol, this is a big wine, particularly for a
pinot noir, but it holds together beautifully and should age well.
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Chateau Lagrezette 1996, Cahors, France. About $20.(end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   No one has worked harder to put the wines of Cahors, in
southwest France, on the map than Alain-Dominique Perrin, the owner
of the magnificent Chateau Lagrezette. Perrin was for many years
president of Cartier, the jewelry house, and currently heads the
Vendome Group, which includes Cartier, Alfred Dunhill and several
other luxury-goods producers.
</P>
<P>
   From his investment over the years in Lagrezette, it's apparent
that he maintains the same high standards for his wine as he does
for his jewelry. To that end, he consults regularly with Michel
Rolland, one of Bordeaux's best-known enologists.
</P>
<P>
   Cahors wines long had a reputation for high tannins and
off-putting intensity. By adding up to 20 percent merlot to the
classic Cahors grape, the malbec _ called auxerrois in this part of
France _ Rolland has produced a full-bodied but nicely rounded wine
with a pleasant and distinctive bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   Among my mail recently was a letter from Ted Conklin, the owner
and manager of the American Hotel in Sag Harbor, N.Y. Conklin, who
transformed a faded hotel into a popular inn and restaurant, and
who also has one of the most sophisticated wine cellars in the
country, took issue with a recent column that discussed the many
factors that go into the cost of a bottle of wine.
</P>
<P>
   The column pointed out that the lion's share of whatever the
customer pays goes to the retailer or restaurateur, with the
winemaker often receiving less than 50 cents for a bottle that can
cost the consumer 100 times that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Most restaurant owners I talked to said they were merely passing
along high costs imposed on them by the distributors, or that high
wine prices were the only way to subsidize the relatively higher
costs of food and its preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Conklin noted that while price-gouging may exist, ``restaurants
either make prices fair or they fail _ in the best of capitalistic
traditions. Competition has already established the fair-market
value for wines. This is especially true for restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   He objected to any comparison of the net profit of wineries and
a wine's mark-up in restaurants, because, net profits, he said, are
calculated after such costs as salaries, land and travel expenses
are paid. Wineries, he wrote, ``are hugely capital-intensive, owned
and run primarily by the very rich or by large corporations.''
``They enjoy significant tax advantages from depreciation and
agricultural subsidy,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants, he continued, ``aren't even on the same planet.''
If a restaurant sells a thousand bottles of wine at a profit of
$33.50 a bottle, he noted, ``it has $33,500 to pay for serving (the
wine) in 3,000 to 4,000 wine glasses, a lot of which break; a
dishwasher, polishing, waiters, rent, lights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want your readers to believe,'' he asked, ``that
restaurateurs should feel guilty about their wine profits and the
consumer should sympathize with Robert Mondavi and Ravenswood?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, neither. But the fact remains that wine prices are
appallingly high. More and more money is chasing a small and
unchanging amount of fine wine.
</P>
<P>
   When the economy cools down and demand drops off, the winemakers
will lower their prices; they always do. And restaurateurs like
Conklin will surely follow suit. And all polemics aside, it can't
happen soon enough.

 &HT;    MEXICO CITY MAYOR SUBMITS RESIGNATION SO HE CAN RUN FOR
PRESIDENT
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, Mexico City's mayor,
submitted a letter of resignation Tuesday so he can dedicate
himself to his third presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City's Legislative Assembly must approve the resignation
_ which was expected _ before Cardenas officially steps down more
than a year before his term ends in December 1999. He could leave
office as early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   Running for president and managing this troubled capital of 10
million are ``incompatible,'' Cardenas told reporters Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The likely nominee of Mexico's Democratic Revolution Party, or
PRD, Cardenas is trailing in third or fourth place in most
presidential opinion surveys.
</P>
<P>
   He is the the son of Mexico's most beloved president and a
leading figure for Mexico's left. In 1997, Cardenas became the
first mayor here to be elected by residents rather than appointed
by Mexico's president.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas also ran for president and lost, in 1988 and 1994. Many
Mexicans believe the 1988 contest was rigged and stolen from
Cardenas by Mexico's Revolutionary Institutional Party, or PRI,
which has controlled the presidency for 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas belonged to the PRI until 1988, when he broke with the
party and went on to form the center-left PRD.
</P>
<P>
   Since Cardenas began his tenure as mayor his popularity has
dropped steadily in opinion polls. Analysts attribute his slide in
great part to Cardenas' failure to run a modern political campaign
and satisfy citizens' demands for a dramatic reduction in crime.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's opposition parties are considering forming an alliance
that would back one presidential candidate against the PRI in 2000.
If such an alliance were formed, Cardenas' chances of becoming the
nominee are looking slimmer.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll published Tuesday, Reforma newspaper found that
Cardenas was preferred by only 19 percent of 1,215 people who were
asked for their as an alliance candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox, the candidate of Mexico's conservative National
Action Party, was preferred by 60 percent.

HIGH HOPES: EAST TEXAS COUNTY READIES SPACEPORT BID 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Calif.) 
 
By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREEPORT, Texas _ Some might accuse Brazoria County officials of
being starry-eyed dreamers in their quest to make this East Texas
county the Cape Canaveral of the commercial space industry.
</P>
<P>
   After all, most of the commercial space business _ that of
sending satellites into space _ is done overseas by the Chinese,
French and Russians. Launches in the United States are done
primarily from government bases.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Brazoria County may have a shot.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: NASA has given an aerospace consortium the go-ahead
to build the prototype for a reusable launch vehicle and find a
launch site _ not necessarily in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the Texas Legislature in its last session
authorized the creation of local spaceport authorities, paving the
way for Texas counties like Brazoria to grab onto the U.S. effort
to recapture the lead in the commercial space market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of visionary right now,'' admitted Fred Welch, as he
swept his hand over the marshy, snaky coastal plain that runs from
Texas 36 in Freeport to the Gulf of Mexico. ``You have to imagine a
12,000-foot runway and 900,000 square feet of manufacturing and
administrative space.''
</P>
<P>
   As the executive director of the Brazoria County Partnership,
Welch is hoping his county can convince the consortium, led by
Lockheed Martin Corp., that it's the right place to launch the
VentureStar, a vehicle resembling today's space shuttle that could
take off and land at one spaceport.
</P>
<P>
   Attracting the project could mean hundreds of jobs, increased
tourism and associated business for the county of more than 200,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the concept of using space for commercial reasons may
sound farfetched. Yet there is increasing demand from private
industry to send payloads into space, from drug companies that want
to perform scientific experiments in space to telecommunication
companies that want to send up more satellites.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost is expensive _ about $10,000 to get one pound into
space. So NASA is sponsoring the building of a reusable launch
vehicle to provide low-cost, continual launches.
</P>
<P>
   The VentureStar project is led by Lockheed Martin, with partners
Boeing Co., AlliedSignal, BF Goodrich Co. and Sverdrup Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The group has a $1.2 billion partnership with NASA to build a
177-foot-wide, 170-foot-long vehicle that would launch vertically
from a pad and land much as the shuttle does now.
</P>
<P>
   Using lighter, reusable equipment should lower the price
substantially, said Tony Jacob, business development analyst with
Lockheed in Palmdale, Calif. VentureStar's goal is to reduce the
price of getting something to space to $1,000 a pound on weekly
flights.
</P>
<P>
   A half-size model should be finished in the first quarter of
2000, Jacob said. After test flights, VentureStar will go into
production, with the first commercial flight scheduled for 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle probably will be built close to where it will be
launched, Jacob said. It's so big that it would be hard to move it
far.
</P>
<P>
   That will mean 2,000 to 3,000 jobs initially to build the craft.
Once it's operational, the company will need between 200 and 300
employees to launch weekly flights.
</P>
<P>
   The group is looking into building as many as two vehicles in
the United States, Jacob said.
</P>
<P>
   So is Space Access, a venture-capital firm from Palmdale,
Calif., that Welch also is trying to woo to Brazoria County.
</P>
<P>
   Space Access' reusable launch vehicle looks like a jet and has
its payload in the front. The unusual design features a ``beak'' in
front, which opens up and ``spits out'' a satellite. The
330-foot-long vehicle is known as ``alligator mouth,'' said Mike
Wade, vice president of programs for the 5-year-old company.
</P>
<P>
   He estimates it will take 3,000 workers to build the vehicle and
another 250 to 300 to maintain it on a continual basis.
</P>
<P>
   However, Space Access first has to finish designing its vehicle,
and that will take some money. The company is in the midst of
trying to raise funds through a private stock placement by
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   Welch's economic development group has identified two launch
sites _ a 4,000-acre parcel owned by Dow Chemical and a 1,500-acre
parcel owned by the Port of Freeport.
</P>
<P>
   The land is sparsely populated, which is necessary for safety
reasons, _ yet close enough to Houston to attract skilled
employees. Freeport is about 50 miles south of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   However, Brazoria County faces some stiff competition. And it
can't exactly build a spaceport on speculation _ the country won't
need too many of them.
</P>
<P>
   For the Space Access project, Brazoria County is competing with
Kenedy County in South Texas, along with a site in Florida and
another in California. Wade said the company will let the areas
present incentive packages before it makes its final decision.
</P>
<P>
   The VentureStar project is looking at 28 sites in 15 states,
Jacob said. While the project has had people in Brazoria County
looking over the sites, it's still too early to narrow down the
choices, or figure out how the financing will work.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Jacob said, VentureStar will select up to two sites
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While Brazoria County has its collective fingers crossed, Tom
Moser, executive director of the Texas Aerospace Commission, a
state agency in Austin, believes Texas has a good chance to land a
spaceport.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are interested in Texas, he said, including a third
one that is secretly kicking tires around the Lone Star State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you who they are,'' Moser said.
</P>
<P>
   Moser and Welch said it was a great step forward when the
Legislature voted this spring to allow the creation of local
spaceport authorities. Each authority will have the power to
acquire property and issue revenue bonds. Welch estimated it will
take about $300 million in revenue bonds to build a spaceport.
</P>
<P>
   Brazoria County Commissioners Court is expected to form the
board for a spaceport authority later this fall. Welch also will be
hiring consultants to study environmental factors such as wetlands,
soils, plants and animals to determine if the land is suitable for
a spaceport.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, the United States had 75 percent of the
launch business, Jacob said. Today, that has gone down to 25 to 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, French and Russians have taken over much of the
business of sending satellites into orbit, using
government-subsidized, expendable space vehicles, Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston aggressively went after aerospace/airplane manufacturing
work in the mid-1980s but never had much success, said Saadat Syal,
former vice president of economic development for the Greater
Houston Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Something that came up over and over was a concern that Houston
didn't have a work force that was used to dealing with alloys,
composite materials and high-end welding, said Syal, who is now a
property developer in the Houston area. There was a sense that the
energy industry had a different kind of work force.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't seem to be as much of a drawback this time around,
however. Both VentureStar and Space Access said they plan to buy
component parts and will deal with contractors that have experience
with aerospace materials.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Brazoria group has spent $85,000 on hiring an
engineering consultant and business strategy consultant, as well as
on meeting and travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way off, Welch admits, but if it works out, the
spaceport would be the biggest deal since Dow Chemical decided 50
years ago to build its huge chemical complex in Brazoria County.

DODGERS ARRIVE FOR CANDLESTICK'S LAST RIVALRY

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Tommy Lasorda and Ron Cey crossed paths in the
meal room at Dodger Stadium last week, and the ex-manager was eager
to chat with the ex-third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda: ``Hey, Penguin, they've invited me to Candlestick Park
for the final series.''
</P>
<P>
   Cey: ``What are you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda: ``They asked me to go on the field. Should I wear the
uniform?''
</P>
<P>
   Cey: ``Got to wear the uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda: ``What do you think the fans will do? You know, I'm in
the Hall of Fame now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cey: ``They'll probably do what they've always done.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants fans, get your vocal cords ready. The Los Angeles Dodgers
are coming to Candlestick Park one last time, and fittingly it's
for the final baseball series at the 'Stick that began Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans would boo us, but they were great,'' Lasorda said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd have 14,000 for Atlanta on a Thursday, and we'd come in
Friday and they'd have 40,000. They wanted to beat us. The rivalry
was there.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams played 340 games at the 'Stick, and the Giants hold a
180-160 edge. It's little consolation, because while the Giants
played in two World Series over 40 seasons, the Dodgers played in
eight.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing will erase that history was in the making at
Candlestick whenever the teams hooked up. Some moments were grand,
such as Brian Johnson's beating the Dodgers with a 12th-inning home
run off Mark Guthrie, Joe Morgan's homering off Terry Forster to
knock the Dodgers out of the playoffs, and Willie Mays' setting a
National League home-run record by going deep against Claude
Osteen.
</P>
<P>
   Some weren't so grand, such as when Juan Marichal smacked Johnny
Roseboro with a bat and Reggie Smith jumped into the stands to
attack a fan.
</P>
<P>
   After Candlestick closes its doors to baseball this week, the
Giants and Dodgers will resume their rivalry in downtown San
Francisco at the new Pacific Bell Park. As for Candlestick, only
the memories will remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've hit some pretty meaningful home runs,'' Hall of Famer
Morgan said recently, ``but the one I hit to beat the Dodgers in
1982 was right up there, one of the top two or three in my career.
It meant so much for the Giants and their fans to beat the Dodgers
that day.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the final day of the regular season, one day after the
Dodgers ruined the Giants' playoff hopes with a 15-4 rout. The
Giants figured if not them, then not the Dodgers, either. Morgan's
homer decided a 5-3 victory that handed the National League West to
the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   For the Giants in the early years, there was no greater
accomplishment than in 1962, when they overcame a four-game deficit
with seven to play to pull into a 162-game tie, then beat the
Dodgers in a best-of-three playoff to secure a date in the World
Series with the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Down the stretch, the rivalry peaked in a mid-August series at
Candlestick Park. That's when the Dodgers cried foul, complaining
the 'Stick's grounds crew intentionally watered down the basepaths
to impede their running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I still have a cold from that day,'' said Maury Wills.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodger stole a then-record 104 bases that year, but it
wouldn't be easy at the 'Stick. When umpire Bill Jackowski noticed
the wet grounds, he ordered the crew to dump sand on the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Giants said they'd be happy to,'' Wills said. ``That made
it even worse. Normally, they couldn't throw me out if the catcher
was on the pitcher's mound.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants won three straight _ the biggest hit was Willie
McCovey's pinch homer off Don Drysdale in the second game _ to cut
the Dodgers' lead from 5 1/2 to 2 1/2. They lost six straight in
September but still overcame the Dodgers for a spot in the World
Series, which they lost in seven games, ending when McCovey's
sizzling liner sadly landed in the glove of second baseman Bobby
Richardson with the potential winning run on base.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry hit its low point in the 1965 Marichal-Roseboro
incident. Pitchers threw at hitters during a late-August series,
and the Dodgers were frustrated that Sandy Koufax wouldn't
retaliate for Marichal's knock-down pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Roseboro took it upon himself. With Marichal at the plate, the
catcher threw a ball to Koufax that nearly hit Marichal in the
nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You better not hit me with that ball,' and I went
after him,'' Roseboro said.
</P>
<P>
   Marichal hit Roseboro with his bat and received a nine-game
suspension, which may have cost the Giants the pennant. They lost
to the Dodgers by two games.
</P>
<P>
   One of the teams' hottest fights came in September 1971 in the
final days of another Giants-Dodgers race. The Giants didn't
appreciate Bill Singer's flooring Mays with a pitch, so Marichal
threw a fastball into Bill Buckner's ribs. The benches emptied as
Buckner charged the mound, and several players were ejected.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had the last laugh, winning the division by one game
over the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Among all-time opposing players, former Dodger first baseman
Steve Garvey is second to Pete Rose with 153 Candlestick hits.
</P>
<P>
   Cey, a third baseman, hit 24 home runs, topping everyone except
Dale Murphy and Willie Stargell. On the visitors' RBI list, Cey and
Garvey are 1-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the success I had there, I was one of the favorite
targets,'' Cey said. ``I looked forward to it. To get booed on the
road is a confidence booster.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Garvey, ``I took the boos as a compliment.''

CHILDREN TO ROAM BATTLEFIELD, ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT CIVIL WAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year at this time, the chalky, cedar-studded hills around
Granbury, Texas, become Civil War battlefields. Hundreds of
re-enactors dressed in their finest blues and grays break out the
muzzleloaders and face off against each other in mock anger.
</P>
<P>
   The battles they re-create are those of Gen. Hiram B. Granbury,
the town's namesake. This year, beginning Saturday morning, the
troops will fall out to re-enact the 1864 battle for Atlanta, and
the Battle of Spring Hill, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the serious activity will take place the day before,
when the hills will teem with the event's liveliest audience.
Coordinators expect 500 to 600 schoolchildren from the towns of
Lipan, Tolar and Granbury to pour onto the battlegrounds Friday
morning asking questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to give them tours of the camp,'' said Cathey
Sims, a teacher at Granbury Middle School. ``The re-enactors will
be in camp, both Union and Confederate, and they will talk with the
students about the history of the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims will also have some students working at the camp. She not
only teaches history at the middle school, she sponsors the junior
historians, more than a dozen seventh-graders who enjoy studying
history beyond the textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Those students will dress in costumes and help to educate the
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on their costumes now, and they've been told to
research what it was like for children their age during the Civil
War,'' Sims said.
</P>
<P>
   She points out that, while Texas, especially the area around
Granbury, never suffered the destruction of prolonged Civil War
battles, the settlers there had their own brand of adversity.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil War called away most of the able-bodied men, leaving
women and children to tend the fields. It was not a movement lost
on the Comanches, who were still fighting to reclaim their land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the women took turns wearing men's clothing,'' Sims
said. ``They did it so the Comanche wouldn't know that all the men
were gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims said her students are 12- and 13-year-olds, about the same
age as the oldest children left behind during the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were too young to go off to the war, so they ended up
being the oldest ones still working the farms. The heavy work fell
to them, and it was a hard way of life. They had a lot of
responsibility,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This year's event will focus primarily on the effect the Civil
War had on families, and women's roles on and off the battlefield.
Proceeds from ticket sales and food and craft booths will go to
Mission Granbury, a nonprofit group helping victims of domestic
violence and families in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The re-enactment grounds will be open from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30
p.m. Saturday, and from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Sunday. The camps
are open for tours. The grounds are at the Prairie Creek
Battlefield, about 10 miles southwest of downtown Granbury on Farm
Road 51 South.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets at the gate are $7 for adults and $5 for seniors 65 and
older and for children 5 to 12. For more information, call the
Granbury Convention and Visitors Bureau at (800) 950-2212. &QL;

   MEXICO-POLITICS (Mexico City) _ Talks among opposition parties

the party that has controlled Mexico for seven decades will win
power once again next year. By Julia Preston.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-FORTUNE (Shanghai) _ China is celebrating 50 years of
communist rule this week, among other ways, by inviting more than
300 of the world's leading capitalists to gather for a conference
in this city. But the Fortune Global Forum is unintentionally
highlighting the deeply troubled nature of China's business
dealings with the West, which remain plagued on both sides by
mistrust, naivete, misunderstanding and wishful thinking, just as
they have for decades. By Seth Faison.

<P>
   JAPAN-YOUTHCRIME _ Youth crime is one of the fastest-growing
criminal categories in Japan. And as schools across Japan, and
towns large and small increasingly become the theater of attacks by
gangs, sexual crimes and theft, Japanese authorities are pulling
the alarm. According to national police figures, violence and crime
by school-age children has been rising fast both in and outside of
school for several years. And the number of juveniles arrested last
year for serious crimes like murder, rape and robbery pushed above
1,000 for the third consecutive year. By Howard W. French.

   FISCAL-SHOWDOWN (Washington) _ This was going to be the year
that Congress and the Clinton administration de-electrified the
third rail of American politics, putting partisanship aside to
insure the long-term viability of the Social Security system. It
never happened. Instead, Social Security proved to be as
irresistible and potent a political weapon as ever, if not more so.
And decisions by both parties to use the retirement program's
almost sacred place in the hearts of voters as a club against the
other help explain why Congress and the White House are again
headed toward a budget showdown. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS (Washington) _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday assigned
itself an important role in the debate over managed health care by
agreeing to decide whether a woman can sue her health-maintenance
organization after she suffered a ruptured appendix during an
eight-day wait for a test to diagnose her abdominal pain. The woman
maintains that the HMO's financial structure, under which doctors'
compensation depended in part on their success in holding down

interests. By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   SPEND-CONGRESS (Washington) _ Acknowledging that Congress cannot
pass its appropriations bills before the new fiscal year begins on
Friday, the House passed a bill on Tuesday that will keep federal
agencies functioning for three weeks while Republicans negotiate
over hundreds of billions of dollars of spending with President
Clinton. The Senate is expected to pass the bill later Tuesday
night. Passage of the stop-gap measure, called a continuing

 &HT;    Cox Communications, Liberate Technologies agree on dealBy
Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cable TV provider Cox Communications has inked a deal
with a software developer who will provide such interactive
services as online gaming and Internet access through the company's
digital set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is with Liberate Technologies, a software developer
based in San Carlos, Calif., that makes a product called the
Liberate Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Cox Communications plans to use Liberate's
technology to eventually offer a host of new interactive services.
But the company is still deciding exactly what applications to
offer, at what price and in what cities. It does plan to begin
testing the service by the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is good news for another Atlanta-based company,
Scientific-Atlanta. It makes the digital network, called Explorer
2000, that will enable Liberate's technology to be used by Cox
Communications customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cox is committed to bringing enhanced entertainment and
information services to its customers,'' says Tom Nagel, the
company's vice president of business development. ``Liberate's
open, customizable (sic) and highly advanced solution will allow us
to provide customers interactive features and services to enrich
their interactive television experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberate is no stranger to either Cox Communications or the
cable TV industry. The company has raised $50 million in financing
from Cox Communications, Comcast, MediaOne and other cable
operators.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors in Liberate include America Online, General
Instrument, Lucent Technologies, Nintendo and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   This investment has helped finance Liberate's development of
software that enables interactive services through the cable TV
industry's new digital cable networks. These networks are slowly
rolling out nationwide, including metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications is the country's fifth largest cable TV
operator, with 6 million customers nationwide. While based in
Atlanta, the company's only Georgia system is in Macon.

 &HT;    Coaching heavyweights face off in Circle City Classic
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pete Richarson of Southern University and Joe Taylor
of Hampton are regarded as two of the top coaches in black college
football.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, in the annual Circle City Classic in the RCA Dome in
Indianapolis, the two long-time adversaries will oppose each other
in a game televised live on BET.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to be an empty seat in the house,''
Taylor said. ``There will be a lot of interesting matchups and some
great football.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Richardson arrived in Baton Rouge in 1993 , Southern (4-0)
has posted a 60-15 record. The Baton Rouge, La., school has won
three SWAC championships and four Heritage Bowl titles.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 49, whose Pirates dominated the CIAA (34-4-1) before
moving up to I-AA, are 36-14 since joining the MEAC in 1995.
Hampton won MEAC titles in 1997 and '98 and is ranked No.1 in the
Sheridan Broadcast Network poll. Southern is No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game will be the first for Richardson and Taylor
against each other since both were in the CIAA. Richardson was at
Winston-Salem State and Taylor was at Virginia Union before leaving
for Hampton '92.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been looking forward to playing each for the past two or
three years,'' Richardson said. ``We're all excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton will be led offensively by Stone Mountain native Roy
Johnson, a four-year starter at quarterback and now a grad student.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy is steady _ intelligent,'' Taylor said. ``He's done
everything we've asked of him. He really knows how to put us in the
right situation offensively to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern lost 23 regulars from last season's conference and
Heritage Bowl championship team. But it opened the season by
knocking off a Northwestern State team that was ranked No. 6 in
I-AA at time, and has used balance to stay undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars have passed for 681 yards and run for 726, while
allowing 510 yards on the ground and 579 through the air.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Entering the fifth week of play, none of nine CIAA teams has a
winning record. It will change this week, when the four teams that
are .500 will be paired in two games. Virginia State (2-2, 2-0)

 &HT;    MOST STUDENTS SCORE 'BASIC' ON U.S. WRITING EXAM
 &HT;    480&AMP;add
 &HT;    With WRITING-DATA
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most American students have basic writing skills,
but fall short of being fully proficient, according to results
released Tuesday from written exams given in late 1998 to 60,000
students in grades 4, 8 and 12.
</P>
<P>
   The exams given by the National Assessment of Educational
Progress (NAEP) were scored using a new system approved by the
National Assessment Governing Board, an independent,
congressionally chartered organization loaded with blue-ribbon
policy experts.
</P>
<P>
   The board set four achievement levels _ advanced, proficient,
basic and below basic _ after a professional testing firm scored
120,000 stories, reports and persuasive essays written within a
25-minute deadline by the 60,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the board reported:
</P>
<P>
   _ The highest rating of ``advanced'' was awarded to about one
percent of the students in each grade.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ``proficient'' rating, representing ``solid academic
performance for each grade assessed,'' was earned by 22 percent in
fourth grade, 25 percent in eighth grade and 21 percent in 12th
grade.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ``basic'' rating, defined as ``partial mastery of
prerequisite knowledge and skills'' needed for proficient work, was
earned by 61 percent in fourth grade, 58 percent in eighth grade
and 57 percent in 12th grade.
</P>
<P>
   _ Below the ``basic'' level were 16 percent in fourth grade, 16
percent in eighth grade and 22 percent in 12th grade.
</P>
<P>
   A debate over the significance of the results erupted during the
news conference at the U.S. Department of Education where the
288-page report on the results was released.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only about one-fourth of the students can write at the
proficient level or above,'' said Gary W. Phillips, acting
commissioner of education statistics.
</P>
<P>
   However, pointed out Secretary of Education Dick Riley,
``Compared to other NAEP reports (on reading, science and math), we
have fewer young people at the 'below basic' level, and, to my way
of thinking, that is positive.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``The vast majority of our young people are at the
basic level and many of them are very close to moving up one notch
to the proficient level.''
</P>
<P>
   Those views are simply two sides of the same coin, said board
member Marilyn Whirry, who teaches advanced writing courses at Mira
Costa High School in Manhattan Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   She said the exam results showed that ``many students are able
to write at a basic, minimally effective level, but far too few can
produce strong, coherent prose.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, none of the participants from
government, educational and research organizations was willing to
venture a guess as to why girls scored 20 points higher than boys
on the test's 300-point scoring scale. Several called for more
research and for experiments in improving the boys' scores.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Students who took the test also filled out questionnaires about
their activities at home and in school. Their answers supported
those who say that good writing is a craft that is related to
reading and can be learned, rather than an inherited ability.
</P>
<P>
   Scores were higher for students who said they often discuss
their school work at home or that they come from a home with more
than 25 books, an encyclopedia or subscriptions to a newspaper or
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Scores also were higher for those who said they discuss their
writing with teachers, plan ahead before they start writing, write
more than one draft and save their writing in folders or
portfolios, noted Richard Sterling, executive director of the
National Writing Project at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is encouraging news because these broad strategies are
advocated by a wide array of researchers, scholars and teachers of
writing,'' said Sterling, whose project has trained tens of
thousands of teachers in methods of improving student writing.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government paid for the 60,000 exams in the national
test, which were conducted in a scientific sample of the nation's
public and private schools.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, NAEP tested another 100,000 eighth-graders in
public schools in 35 states, the District of Columbia, the Virgin
Islands and the domestic and overseas education systems of the
Department of Defense. Those areas paid extra so that they would
have a large enough sample to compare their eighth graders to those
in other places.
</P>
<P>
   After examining the state results, lots of researchers and
policy-makers who want to learn the best ways to teach writing are
likely to be headed for the places with the highest writing scores
for eighth-graders. They were the schools in Connecticut, U.S.
military bases overseas, domestic military bases, Maine,
Massachusetts, Texas and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   All have emphasized the teaching and testing of writing skills
in recent years. Scores of their Hispanic, African-American and
poor students particularly in schools at defense facilities, Texas,
Wisconsin and Connecticut _ were significantly higher than those of
other poor, Hispanic and African-American students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing has been a strong focus within our system for several
years,'' commented Ray Tolleson, interim director of education
activity in the Department of Defense. ``If anything makes us feel
good, it is that among both African American and Hispanic students,
we were at the top of the list.''

BUSH `IN OUTSTANDING CONDITION,' DOCTOR SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's health is as robust as his
presidential fund-raising, according to a medical report released
by Bush's campaign Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper of Dallas, who conducted Bush's annual
physical examination June 17, a few days after Bush kicked off his
national campaign, said the 53-year-old governor's fitness was in
the top 1 percent for his age group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, I find a man in outstanding condition,'' Cooper said
in a followup telephone interview with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The report, however, revealed for the first time that Bush
underwent surgery July 6, 1998, for the removal of two benign
polyps from his colon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was minor, and they were benign, and the governor didn't
feel like they needed to be made public,'' Bush spokeswoman Mindy
Tucker said, explaining why the colon surgery, which occurred
during Bush's re-election campaign, had not been previously
announced.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office promptly announced arthroscopic knee
surgery that Bush underwent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, who has examined Bush annually since 1989, said he has
never found any indication that Bush has ever used illegal drugs, a
nagging question that the governor has refused to answer fully in
his national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has totally abstained from alcohol during the past 13
years. He has no history of any alcohol, drug, mental or
psychiatric treatment or rehabilitation,'' the doctor wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to questions about whether he used illegal drugs, Bush
has admitted making ``mistakes'' as a young man but has refused to
say whether those mistakes included experimentation with illegal
drugs. Pressed by reporters last month, Bush would say only that he
hasn't used illegal drugs since 1974, the year he turned 28.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said the governor weighed 192 1/2 pounds, a few pounds
heavier than what was considered best for his 6-foot height. But
Cooper said Bush's body weight was good.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's blood pressure was 104/80, and his pulse was 38, which
the doctor called normal for a ``highly conditioned athlete.'' His
cholesterol level was 176, which Cooper called ``outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The remainder of the physical examination was well within
normal limits, and he had no indications of any cardiovascular
problems,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   The physician rated Bush's cardiovascular fitness as ``excellent
to superior'' and said he had a ``low to very low coronary risk
profile.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said Bush eats a low-fat diet, runs three to four miles
five times a week and works out with free weights once a week. He
said Bush's fitness, based on a treadmill stress test administered
during his June physical, was in the top 1 percent for men in their
50s.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor said he was particularly impressed that Bush,
immediately after completing the stress test, ran two miles in less
than 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper noted that Bush had a mild high-frequency hearing loss,
which he said was most likely related to aircraft noise. Bush was a
Texas Air National Guard pilot from 1968-1973.
</P>
<P>
   The only other problems that Cooper cited were some back
stiffness and minor stiffness in Bush's left knee, which the
governor attributed to his regular exercise program. Neither
problem required medication.
</P>
<P>
   According to the medical report, Bush had minor surgery to his
chest wall when he was 13 and an appendectomy when he was 10.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign said the medical summary was being released ``in
accordance with past presidential campaigns.''

`MARIO GOLF' KIND OF ROUGH GOING FOR MARIO GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nintendo has never wanted it any other way: Mario is for kids.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the Donkey Kong arcade game in the '80s, the
colorful, clumsy plumber has fumbled his way through more than
two-dozen games, all of which have been geared toward young
players. Even the complicated brain-buster Mario 64 is,
essentially, a kid's game.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's so surprising that Mario Golf (Nintendo for N64,
$50, all ages) is so difficult. This is the first Mario game that,
unlike all the other Mario-theme sports titles, you can't just pick
up and start playing. Well, you can, but you're gonna have a tough
time with it.
</P>
<P>
   The premise sounds kinda fun: Mario and all his pals take to the
course. But gamers won't get much enjoyment out of this unless
they're already familiar with the headaches involved in mastering a
golf video game. You gotta get your angle right, know how much
power to use per hit and calculate everything just right or you'll
wind up in the trees or water, or not even hitting the thing; it's
just too complex for nongolf fans.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are into golf games will love it, though. The graphics
are well-done and the courses are as interesting as any PC golf
title. For the younger gamer ... hey, what about Mario Putt-Putt?
</P>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Planet of the Apes for your 13-year-old. That pretty
much sums up Ape Escape (Sony for PlayStation, $30, all ages), the
first PlayStation game to totally utilize the system's Dual Shock
analog controller (that's another $30, mom).
</P>
<P>
   Escape pits a kid hero against a bunch of unruly baboons who
snuck out of the zoo and are bent on changing humans into Roddy
McDowell. Your job: Round 'em up.
</P>
<P>
   Graphically and game-playwise, this is a little bit like Crash
Bandicoot, only a little harder. It's so tricky, in fact, you gotta
get the strategy guide ($15) to figure everything out. So, for one
game, you're looking to spend $75. Good game, but not $75 good.
</P>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the PlayStation, Sony released more details about
its upcoming PlayStation 2 last week. The biggest news: Gamers
won't have to wait till Christmas of next year to get one. Should
be out in the United States by fall of next year. Japan gets 'em
March 4. Over there, they'll go for 39,800 yen, or about $400.
</P>
<P>
   The system will not only play games (both PlayStation 2 and
original PlayStation titles) but also music CDs and DVD movies.
Better, for $400.

ETHNIC MARKETS, NOW A CLICK AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new Web site that sells ingredients for dishes from the world
over has joined with the American Red Cross to raise money and
contribute food for victims of last month's earthquake in Turkey.
When visitors to the site, www.ethnicgrocer.com, click on a Turkish
Earthquake Relief Fund icon on the home page and make a
contribution, the company matches it with a food donation of equal
value.
</P>
<P>
   The site is run by Parry Singh, 29, and Subhash Bedi, 27, who
developed it through market research in classes leading to their
MBAs at the J.L. Kellogg School of Business at Northwestern
University, in Evanston, Ill., where their headquarters remain.
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for a site that sells more than 20,000 ethnic
food products and gives recipes to educate America on ethnic
cuisines came simply enough last summer. The Indian-born Singh was
visiting his brother in Burbank, Calif., north of Los Angeles, when
his sister-in-law was about to embark on an hour's drive she made
twice a month to Artesia, south of the city, where Indian food
shops are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   She made it plain even to a visitor what a chore the trip was,
and Singh began thinking of a better way. He had a bachelor's
degree in computer engineering and a master's in electrical
engineering, so the direction of his thinking was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site has food products of India, China, Japan, Korea,
Vietnam, Italy, Greece, Spain, Germany, Poland and Mexico, among
other countries. They are chosen by what Singh calls ``ethnic
czars,'' including two Indian chefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are currently over 26 people and growing rapidly,'' Singh
wrote by e-mail. Indian products, for example, go from Aloo Mattar,
a vegetable curry (14.1 ounces for $3.79), to Vindaloo, a sauce (10
ounces for $2.89), and include cardamom, curry, cumin and varieties
of breads and chutneys.
</P>
<P>
   Bedi, who has largely organized the relief project, was born in
the United States but went to live in India through his teen-age
years. The food for the project is bought in Turkey as much as
possible and consists of bread, milk and other staples, not the
Turkish specialties like apricot jam and pomegranate syrup that are
sold on the site. Bedi wrote that ``based on consumer feedback and
participation, we will keep the program going through November.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A different view of ethnic specialty foods may be found at
www.chefshop.com, a Seattle-based site founded in 1995, which has
expanded and brought in Jeff Bergman, a specialty food buyer and
merchandiser. He joins Mauny Kaseburg, who has preached fresh
ingredients as the first requirement of good cooking for much of
the '90s on KOUW-FM, the local National Public Radio affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to standbys like Rustichella d'Abruzzo pastas and
Scharffen Berger chocolate, they are betting on an awakened
interest in Spanish cuisine. They have added Spanish luxury
products like Miguel &AMP; Valentino piquillo peppers at $9.99 for a
7.75 ounce jar (click on All Products, then on Pickled and
Marinated Vegetables), La Dalia sweet and bittersweet paprika from
the La Vera region (0.85-ounce tin, $6.99) and La Mancha saffron (1
gram, or 0.035 ounce, $5.59).
</P>
<P>
   A search on the site for paella recipes brings three: paella
rapida, roasted vegetable paella and a seafood and sausage version,
as well as three Kwanzaa rice dishes, which Ms. Kaseburg says are
similar to paella.
</P>
<P>
   Among other new products are Huguel Miel de Provence lavender
honey and wild mountain honey, both in 500-milliliter (16.6-ounce)
jars for $12.49. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Add to sites that sell parts for beloved old kitchen appliances
cuisineparts.com, operated by European Kitchen Bazaar in Waterbury,
Conn. The site, which specializes in Cuisinart wares, has entire
blenders and processors in addition to replacement parts. It also
carries toasters, bread machines and waffle makers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Marsden, the company's customer relations manager, writes
that its prices are discounted. A Cuisinart ``classic style''
electronic toaster sells for $59.95. Gracious Home sells it for
$70, but Bloomingdale's has it this month for $59.99.

   NEW YORK _ The whisk is a wonderful invention. With rapid
swipes, you can turn a slippery puddle of egg whites into
feather-light fluff, cream into a stiff white cloud, and oil and
vinegar into a uniformly viscous liquid. And it gives you control
from the beginning to the finish, something you don't get with an
electric mixer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of the whisk is about as old as it can get,'' said
Burt Wolf, who is revising ``The Cooks' Catalog'' (Harper &AMP; Row,
1975), which he wrote with James Beard, Barbara Kafka and Milton
Glaser. And it's about as elementary as it can get. ``If you want
to multiply the effect of a stick,'' he said, ``keep cutting it
down and separating the ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Whisks come in all shapes and sizes, and for as little as $2 and
as much as $20. I tested nearly 30, applying them to classic uses
like whipped cream, mayonnaise, meringue and butter sauce.
</P>
<P>
   As I tested, two types emerged _ those for emulsifying and those
for incorporating air. Avid cooks may find they need more than one
size of each type. Trying to emulsify a sauce in a small saucepan
with a large balloon whisk, for instance, will be awkward at best.
</P>
<P>
   French whisks or balloon whisks are best for incorporating air
into ingredients like egg whites or cream. As you brush it in a
circular motion through liquid, the wide round end with overlapping
wires pulls efficiently pulls in air.
</P>
<P>
   A good whisk should have at least eight sturdy wires that are
flexible so that as you scrape it along the bottom of a bowl the
wires give a little to make it easy on the arm. The handle should
be comfortable, too, but weighted evenly with the whisk wires. Many
whisks have heavy handles and light wires, which are difficult to
control.
</P>
<P>
   The most effective French and balloon whisks are those with wire
loops of different lengths. Where they intertwine, they should be
loosely layered but not flabby.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have tried to improve upon this design, but not
always to good ends. Williams-Sonoma sells a French whisk that has
a small wire ball inside that looks like a cat toy; it is designed
to increase the volume of air that is trapped with each stroke. As
you whisk, the ball jingles around, so it is fun to use, but it
doesn't whip cream or egg whites more quickly than a good French
whisk. It also makes a mess. With each upward stroke, cream that is
caught in the cage flies out in all directions.
</P>
<P>
   The best whisk I found was also one of the least expensive,
$7.95 at Broadway Panhandler, 477 Broome St. This 14-inch French
whisk with a wood handle has flexible, well-spaced wires. Egg
whites stiffened to thick, tight foam with little effort, and
though it is a long whisk, it is perfectly weighted so that I felt
I had control over every stroke. The whisk is available in several
sizes; prices vary. It would be useful to have one that is less
than 10-inches for whisking small amounts of cream and the large
14-inch one for making a voluminous meringue.
</P>
<P>
   This 14-inch whisk, however, is not all purpose. To make a
vinaigrette or to whisk together a pan sauce with it would be like
picking up peas with chopsticks. Because it has a large round end,
very little of its surface area makes contact on flat surfaces like
a pan. Sauce whisks work better.
</P>
<P>
   Whisks that work best for sauces vary widely in shape, but the
good ones share a common denominator. They are flat, with coils
that cover a large surface in a flat pan. And, as you whisk, the
wires can emulsify a shallow pool of liquid while pulling the
liquid from all corners of the pan. I found several that I liked.
</P>
<P>
   A heat-proof whisk, made for pans with nonstick coatings, makes
sense. The OXO Good Grips flat nylon whisk is comfortable to hold
and flexible, so that as the whisk end _ a flat oval of nylon loops
_ presses into the pan, it covers a large area. But it would not
work as well in a small, straight-sided saucepan. It is $4.99 at
Zabar's, 2245 Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers are also selling heat-proof nylon French and
balloon whisks, but they are unnecessary _ unless you are whipping
eggs over a heat source _ and disappointing. The ones I tried were
too soft and flexible and incorporated air poorly.
</P>
<P>
   A better all-purpose sauce whisk is made by Cuisipro Delbor.
Like the roux whisks that have been around for decades, it
resembles a large spoon with a Slinky-like coil wrapping around the
end. The coil bends to lie flat against the pan no matter what
angle you hold the handle. It's light and resilient, and the coil
is narrow enough to scrape the corners of a pan, an important point
when making sauces with cream. It is $6.95 at Broadway Panhandler.
</P>
<P>
   Of the new-age whisks, WMF's saucepan whisk has five vertical
wires shaped like triangles, and the base of the triangles is the
part that touches the pan. Because the wires cover so much of the
pan surface, it blends sauces like beurre blanc superbly. And yet,
sauces are its only use. It will not aerate a sauce and would be
useless in a bowl. It's $9.95 at Broadway Panhandler.
</P>
<P>
   A similar sauce whisk by Roesle, $19.99 at Chef Central, Paramus
(N.J.) Towne Square, looks more like a French whisk that has been
flattened on the end. Its wires are stiff so it is good for
whisking thicker sauces like bechamel and pastry cream. The flat
end and sharp corners of the whisk wires allow you to reach all
corners of a small, straight-sided saucepan.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest surprise was an 11-inch whisk that looks like a
rendering of the Sun and its planets. From a round handle stretch a
dozen straight wires with metal balls of varying sizes on the end.
Also by WMF, it is $22.99 at Chef Central.
</P>
<P>
   I put it to work in a pan, whisking butter into white wine to
make beurre blanc, and the balls swung fluidly from side to side
and in circles, swirling the liquid into a thick sauce. In a metal
bowl while making mayonnaise, the balls banged against the side
like the clip-clop of a horse as the egg soaked up the oil. Its
design may say museum piece more than cookware, but it is no joke.
My mayonnaise didn't break and my forearm did not ache enough to
have me reaching for the electric mixer _ all I really want in a
whisk.

 By RICK MARIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Out there in America, the fear of a Y2K meltdown
reducing the country to a pre-industrial society has driven many
folks to stockpile supplies of grains, powdered eggs, water, maybe
some guns and ammo.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, millenarians are bunkering down in their own way:
by laying in gallon jugs of Poland Spring and trying to figure out
what wines work with cannellini beans and Italian tuna.
</P>
<P>
   It's looking more and more like a long shot, but what if a Y2K
computer glitch does black out our whole technological
infrastructure? It will be bad enough going without light or heat
or water for who knows how long. But where in the name of Eli Zabar
is a person supposed to get his or her fix of fois gras and
prosciutto di Parma?
</P>
<P>
   Living up once again to its reputation for self parody,
Manhattan is now becoming ground zero for widespread foodie panic _
all right, limited neurosis _ about Y2K. In the event of a
disruption in power caused by crashing computers unable to deal
with the ``00'' date change, serious eaters do not want to be stuck
staring at an old can of chunk light tuna and sucking on a warm
soda.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Baum, a partner in the B.E. Group, which owns Windows on
the World, and his wife, Jennifer, are loading up on that other
staple of the good life: caviar. ``Any time there's a special at
Zabar's, I sort of stock up,'' Ms. Baum said. There are now 16
two-ounce jars of osetra in their refrigerator, which won't do them
any good if power lines go down.
</P>
<P>
   John Gottfried, a partner in the Gourmet Garage chain of
high-end grocers, is laying in lots of truffle butter, imported
Parmesan and, of course, Champagne. The run on French bubbly for
Y2K Eve parties has already driven up some prices. Gottfried said a
case of his favorite Champagne, Bruno Paillard, has gone from $24
to $28 a bottle in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent Gallup poll, 40 percent of adults believe
there may be food shortages due to Y2K, and 39 percent of those
said they planned to stockpile food and water.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers to magazines like American Survivalist and the
followers of the Rev. Jerry Falwell and the Rev. Pat Robertson have
been making ready for TEOTWAWKI (the end of the world as we know
it). Mormons believe in keeping a two-year supply of nonperishables
on hand anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal government has been playing down Y2K
lately, the federal Emergency Management Agency still recommends
preparing for the equivalent of a three-day storm.
</P>
<P>
   For a while there, the 45-pound buckets of wheat, sacks of
powdered milk and cans of bacon were flying out of the warehouses
at companies like Walton Feed, in Montpelier, Idaho. Steve Portela,
its director of sales, said, ``We went from 30 employees to 186 in
two years and I still couldn't keep up with my orders.''
</P>
<P>
   He sold everything from the ``30 Day Survival Unit'' ($169) to
the ``Deluxe 1 Year Unit'' ($947): four-foot-cubes of dehydrated
nutrition for the whole family. Orders were so backed up, Portela
couldn't guarantee delivery by Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   But business has dropped off in the last couple of months,
either because the hard-core Y2K-phobes have fully loaded their
bomb shelters by now or people are just worrying less about what
Robertson was calling ``serious dislocations.''
</P>
<P>
   For some New Yorkers, an interruption in the heirloom tomato
supply qualifies as a serious dislocation, and the anxiety is
taking hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very serious about it,'' said Fred Plotkin, of his Y2K
larder. Plotkin is the author of several books on Italian food and
culture, and he does not intend to let his taste buds down if
something happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because we're in the dark doesn't mean we're not going to
eat well,'' he said. Even without heat, because Plotkin does not
believe it is safe for people to start lighting Sterno in their
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Canned kidney beans, chickpeas, green beans and extra virgin
olive oil will make for a tasty three-bean salad. Onions are a must
for his insalata di tonno, cannellini e cipolla _ a traditional
Tuscan dish made with tuna, beans, chopped fresh onion, olive oil
and lemon.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And he will have babka. ``Given that we'll all be anxious, I
want sweet things,'' he said. ``A babka can last a good long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin's mother, Bernice Price, is taking similar precautions,
with cans of salmon and sardines, as well as powders that, mixed
with juice, provide green vegetable protein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll miss fresh vegetables and fruit,'' Ms. Price said. ``And
of course I'll miss takeout food and and Fairway and Zabar's.''
</P>
<P>
   She was not convinced that these vital operations would be
completely shut down. But, she said of Y2K, ``I feel it will create
a rather serious problem, knowing that under the best of
circumstances the city has trouble dealing with a rainstorm.''
</P>
<P>
   Even skeptics are hedging their bets.
</P>
<P>
   Fern Berman, who handles public relations for Le Cirque and
other New York restaurants, said: ``I'm preparing. I'm not going
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   She intends to buy 40 gallons of water (two months' worth, she
figures) and has started socking away canned vegetables: 15 or 20
tins so far of beans, fish and ``those wonderful little artichokes
in the jars.''
</P>
<P>
   She, too, has epicurean ambitions for her larder. ``On a desert
island, I would bring olives to make olive oil,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also had to buy a nonelectric can opener. ``It's not a big
deal,'' she said of reacquainting herself with this primitive
device. ``And it's easy to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berman said she's the kind of ``slightly neurotic person''
mocked by friends for carrying Purell and Wash'n Dri's, until they
beg to borrow hers.
</P>
<P>
   Storage space will not be a problem, she said. Her apartment has
a ``huge bathroom'' and, if that fills up, she'll stow the overflow
in her office.
</P>
<P>
   All that water does pile up. Marc Murphy, the chef at La
Fourchette, said one of his closets was now crowded with bottles
his brother _ who is in the software business _ had asked to keep
there.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy himself said he's making plenty of pate now because of a
fois gras shortage last year. Five or six terrines should cover his
New Year's Eve party, he said, and ``I'll have enough to keep me
going for a couple of weeks after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cara De Silva, a freelance food writer, will be using her
balcony for storage and refrigeration. ``Unless we have 80-degree
weather, it can stand in for a root cellar,'' she said. She'll put
out Parmigiano-Reggiano, apples, carrots, ``a big chunk of
prosciutto di Parma.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this happens, we will all need good things in our mouths,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing happens, she will simply donate her surplus
prosciutto and Parmesan to charity.
</P>
<P>
   But is there really likely to be a shortage of gourmet
groceries? In Manhattan?
</P>
<P>
   Gottfried, of Gourmet Garage, said, ``Even if everything goofs
up, it can't goof up that long.''
</P>
<P>
   None of these assurances will comfort Erik Hedegaard, a magazine
writer, who sold his New York apartment at a fire-sale price,
traded his mutual funds in the middle of the biggest bull market in
history and generally obsessed over Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought all these five-pound bags of rice,'' Hedegaard said.
``Then I went on the Atkins diet.''

 &HT;    Know the rules for framing and displaying photos _ then break
them
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Sept. 30.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If there's one rule when it comes to framing and
displaying art in the home, it's this: There are none.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, some basic principles apply _ choosing a mat and frame
that doesn't overpower the subject, hanging the art at eye level,
lighting the picture so that it can be fully appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for every rule, there's an un-rule,'' said Myott (who uses
only one name) of Myott's Studio, a custom framing gallery in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A grouping of photos matted and framed in a variety of sizes and
materials can be disruptive, he said. ``But then, sometimes clutter
can be different, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, he said, is pictures should be framed and
displayed to their best advantage while at the same time
complementing a home's decor. After that, think outside the frame,
er, box.
</P>
<P>
   It works for one of Myott's most famous customers _ Elton John.
An avid collector, the part-time Atlantan is loaning 200 of his
2,000 photographs to the High Museum of Art for an exhibit,
``Chorus of Light: Photographs From the Sir Elton John
Collection,'' next year. Many of John's photographs hang in his
penthouse on Peachtree Road. Myott is framing some 800 of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that many, you have to come up with something
different,'' Myott said. ``He's bought some of the most expensive
and finest pieces in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   So you wouldn't expect the British rock musician to rummage the
frame stacks at Wal-Mart. Instead, Myott is hand-gilding some
frames. Some are done in 12- and 22-karat gold. Others feature
rubbed black and warm silver finishes. Photographs as small as 1 by
2 inches have been ``enlarged'' with a mat and 5-inch wide frame.
You'd think such proportions would overwhelm the subject; instead,
they entice the eye into looking a little closer.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone can afford to frame an entire collection at once.
Besides, most art is acquired over time. ``When someone starts
buying art, they usually hang pieces one by one. But if you get
addicted to it, you can't do that,'' said Jane Jackson, an Atlanta
art dealer. ``The next thing is to start grouping them together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, artwork should be planned for when building or
remodeling a home so that proper lighting can be installed, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the stage at which your photo collection falls,
here are some points to consider:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make frames secondary to subjects. While the art is the focus,
that doesn't mean you have to use the same old moldings, said
Atlanta interior designer Bill Cook, an avid collector of
photography. Be creative. Use a frame from a mirror. Ask your
framer to use your own materials, such as fabrics and wallpaper, or
ones that hold sentimental value. ``Sometimes, we'll take a wood
from somebody's barn and frame their pictures,'' Myott said. The
point is to consider more than the usual suspects. ``Ten years ago,
things were all framed in metal with simple white mats,'' Jackson
said. ``Now, there are so many interesting materials until the
framing has become an important part of the piece.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use neutral mats. Mats are sold in every color, but large
neutral ones best complement black and white photos, Myott said. By
double- or triple-matting, you can add a sliver of color that picks
up other hues in the room. ``Sometimes, we use silks because the
fine grain gives a subtle and rich texture, especially for fashions
photos,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Protect your photos. Use a reputable framer who knows how to
protect photos from harmful sunlight, using archival mats,
UV-protection glass and acid-free backing paper. Photos should not
be hung in direct sunlight or near heating vents.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Organize displays. Depending on how many pictures you own, one
way to organize a collection is by subject matter. Six nature
photos can make a grouping. Because the topics are related, you can
vary the materials used to frame them. (Just don't mix color photos
with black and whites.) Conversely, if the subjects are all
different, use the same frame to unify the collection. Jackson, an
art consultant to John who brought him and the museum together,
said the November 2000 exhibit will give visitors an idea of how
the star displays his photography at home. ``A lot of things are
hung from floor to ceiling with whole walls covered in
photographs,'' she said. ``One wall is all images of women. Another
is vintage 1920s, and another room has all photos by one artist.
There's definite thought into the way they're put together.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Create scale with groupings. For large walls, a grouping can
be more effective than a single picture, even a large one. For
rooms with low ceilings, stack several pictures vertically to
create the illusion of height.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hang at eye level _ depending: Most people hang artwork too
high, Myott said. ``Sometimes, when I go in homes it looks like
everything's attached to helium.'' In general, the middle of a
picture should be no higher than 60 inches from the floor, Jackson
said. Yet, there are exceptions, such as in the case of groupings.
Art also should be hung in relation to what's around it, such as
the furniture below it. Pictures above a sofa, for example, should
be hung lower.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Map out a display. Before driving a nail, sketch a plan for
how the pictures will be displayed or at least lay them on the
floor in the desired pattern, Jackson said. Depending on the wall's
size, allow 2 inches between frames, or at least a consistent
amount throughout.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Accent the positive. Why spend money on artwork and framing
without ensuring the piece will be properly seen? Make sure
pictures have adequate lighting, either from ceiling recessed
halogens, track fixtures or picture lamps.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't hang everything at once: If your collection is large,
consider rotating pictures in a display. By using one size mat and
frame, even individual pictures within a grouping can be changed
periodically to freshen the grouping, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't hang everything _ period: Consider unconventional
displays. Cook suggests propping photos on a mantel, shelf or
narrow wall ledge, available at photo and art supply stores. Or you
can make a ledge using a wide strip of molding. Ledges are
particularly effective in hallways where most people struggle to
fill large expanses of wall space. Large pictures also can be
placed in the seat of a chair and leaned against the back. ``In
small apartments, a lot of people just lean things on the floor
against the wall,'' Jackson said. The advantage is photos can
easily be changed _ without leaving walls looking like slices of
Swiss cheese.

THINK ALASKA'S JUST TOO BIG TO BAKE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (af) 
By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No cookbook is more difficult to write than a primer. The author
can assume little, since novices lack the language necessary to
begin. Questions like ``Is my stove gas or electric?'' ``What does
simmer mean?'' and ``How do you strain a can of tomatoes?'' can
reduce longtime recipe writers to sputtering impotence as they try
to explain the fine points of scrambling an egg to people who
wonder how to break one open.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Cunningham, the dean of American home cooks and the
author of the current edition of ``The Fannie Farmer Cookbook'' as
well as the invaluable ``Breakfast Book'' and others, had an
inspiration a few years ago: she would invite a group of noncooks
to her house every Saturday, give them a simple recipe and let them
attack it. What did they understand? What parts were confusing?
What worried them? From this she hoped to develop a book that would
address the needs of the beginning cook.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Learning to Cook With Marion Cunningham''
(Knopf, $29.95), and it is a qualified success. With only 150
recipes, the book is succinct, and in no way intimidating; the
beginning cook is not challenged to prepare perfect french fries.
Selections range from scrambled eggs to risotto, roast leg of lamb
to hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most daunting recipe is parchment-wrapped fish
fillets, which _ assuming foil is used in place of parchment, as it
is here _ is a perfect choice for a beginner.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the recipe selection is old-fashioned but honorable.
Smothered chicken with mushrooms, Mexican lentil soup and American
meatloaf all offer familiar but interesting flavors and procedures
that are difficult to have miscarry.
</P>
<P>
   There are other valuable touches: the inside covers feature
weight and measurement equivalents (although they are repeated in
front and back, rather than offering different information), the
vegetable section opens with an eight-page chart offering buying
and storing guidelines, and the index actually lists the very
things many beginners will search for. Turn to ``simmering,'' for
example, and indeed, it is referenced.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Learning to Cook'' is far from complete, lacking overviews
of herbs and spices, basic cooking techniques, meat and fish, and
the most common substitutions. Although Ms. Cunningham rises to
many inherent challenges, she assumes that readers will understand
a phrase like ``fillet of red snapper or other white fish.''
</P>
<P>
   She instructs the cook to stir risotto ``constantly,'' evidently
believing either that the new cook will somehow interpret this as
``nearly constantly'' or ``frequently,'' or that truly constant
stirring is necessary. (It is not.)
</P>
<P>
   Kudos to her for including brown butter sauce (beurre noisette),
an often overlooked classic. But why is it placed next to an
unrelated recipe, rather than in the ``Extras'' chapter, which
includes other sauces?
</P>
<P>
   In general, the book's design and organization contribute little
to the learning process, and sidebars are overused, muddling rather
than enhancing many pages.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, there are inconsistencies, unnecessary steps and
downright errors. A headnote says that the ``secret'' of scrambled
eggs is low heat, but the recipe uses medium heat; this will
confuse any beginner.
</P>
<P>
   Scallions are not immature onions. Beans need not be soaked
overnight before cooking. To hard-boil eggs, they need not be
cooked 20 minutes. Vegetable shortening is not the best fat for
anything.
</P>
<P>
   When a chicken is roasted to the point where its breast is at
170 to 180 degrees, it is overcooked to the point of inedibility.
Thickening curries and stews with flour is an unneeded step. And so
on.
</P>
<P>
   That said, ``Learning to Cook'' is friendly, warm and genuinely
encouraging. There's much to be said for a book that gets people
into the kitchen _ if only it offered better guidance once they
were there. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Promising ``no ordinary party'' for ``no ordinary
time,'' First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday invited
America to a Y2K bash in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music of our century will be rocking and rolling, swinging and
soaring through the air,'' said Mrs. Clinton in announcing details
of a three-day event called ``America's Millennium: A Celebration
for the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve, actor and rapper Will Smith will host a show
at the Lincoln Memorial that will be televised live on CBS,
beginning at 10 p.m. (EST) The program will include an 18-minute
film highlighting the 20th Century that will be produced by Steven
Speilberg. Half an hour before midnight, the movie entitled ``The
Unfinished Journey'' will premiere on giant outdoor screens as an
orchestra plays an original score by composer John Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of ``America's Millennium'' said in a statement that
``great stars of the entertainment world will perform'' but would
only confirm appearances by Aretha Franklin, Chuck Berry and Mickey
Hart (former drummer of the Grateful Dead). Producer George Stevens
Jr. conceded that many top entertainers have long been booked for
millennium appearances _ Barbra Streisand, for example _ but he
predicted plenty of celebrity power at the D.C. event.
</P>
<P>
   The show will be ``extravagantly entertaining,'' Stevens vowed.
He said the show will be an ``expression of what this country is
all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, the producer of the movie ``The Thin Red Line'' and the
creator of the television events ``The Kennedy Center Honors'' and
``Christmas in Washington,'' will co-produce ``America's Millennium
Gala'' with composer and musician Quincy Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said President Clinton and the first lady will attend
the Lincoln Memorial affair. The televised event in Washington will
rival the traditional Times Square New Year's Eve celebration in
New York, where Mrs. Clinton currently is an undeclared candidate
for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, Stevens and District of Columbia Mayor Anthony
Williams announced the millennium plans at the Old Executive Office
Building, next door to the White House. They said $12.5 million has
been budgeted for the national events, with funding coming from
private donations and the sale of TV rights. The celebration will
begin on New Year's Eve of 1999 and last through Jan. 2, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the national celebration, Williams said the
District will sponsor a ``Main Street Millennium'' block party
along Constitution on Dec. 31. Despite fears that the Y2K bug might
render some computers useless, the mayor vowed that ``lights won't
go out'' and ``all systems are going to work.'' He urged tourists
to book hotel rooms early.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said ``America's Millennium'' will include the
unveiling of a national time capsule that will ``show future
generations how we lived and what we valued most in our time.'' At
the Ronald Reagan International Trade Center, located near the
White House, giant screens will show millennium celebrations and
events from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the new millennium will be heralded by a
``Midnight Moment'' of fireworks and a laser light display between
the Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument. Organizers said they
could handle a crowd of more than 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   During all three days, Mrs. Clinton said, there will be free,
``family-friendly'' events on the Mall that will reflect the theme
of the White House Millennium Council to ``Honor the Past _ Imagine
the Future.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jo Jo, the deluxe Upper East Side restaurant,
celebrated New Year's Eve in characteristic style last year: it
opened early and kept going until 5 a.m., offering a fixed-price
dinner of $500 a head, plus wine. The restaurant was packed, for
each of two seatings, as night turned to dawn.
</P>
<P>
   And how will Jo Jo mark the New Year's Eve ushering in the year
2000? By shutting down for the night. The chef, Jean-Georges
Vongerichten, is locking up Jo Jo and his four other New York
restaurants and flying to Bali to spend his first New Year's Eve
out of the kitchen in 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   And that is not unusual. While many restaurants are planning
extravagantly prepared and stratospherically priced meals to mark
the passing of the 1900s, a growing number of New York's best
restaurants have quietly decided to stay dark for the night.
Gramercy Tavern, Union Pacific, Union Square Cafe, Balthazar, Vong,
Mercer Kitchen, Le Bernardin, Eleven Madison, Tabla, Judson Grill,
Aquavit, the Oyster Bar at Grand Central Terminal and Verbena are
among those turning away people calling for a reservation. Other
restaurateurs are considering shutting down on one of the year's
most profitable nights, weighing the financial benefits against
this year's unusual complications.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons reflect the anxiety felt by New Yorkers in general
as they contemplate the approaching New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Most obviously, there is the fear of rowdiness and drunken
revelers harassing customers and employees, especially in
restaurants anywhere near Times Square. (The owners of Local, a
plush new restaurant on West 47th Street, are not only closing, but
even boarding up the windows to guard against hooliganism.) Beyond
that, some of New York's most experienced restaurateurs are worried
about customer expectations that can never be met, employees who
would resent having to work and the promise of high-priced
everything, Champagne, caviar, entertainment, cutting down the
profit margin and stirring the resentment of their regular
clientele because of the inevitably huge tabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We foresee a lot of problems with the night,'' said Chris
Cannon, the general manager of Judson Grill, the highly rated
restaurant on West 52d Street in the heart of the district where
streets will be closed to traffic. ``Our attitude is, how much
money can you make in one night? We have a lack of confidence in
people getting to the restaurant effectively, about how much
business are we going to do and concern for our own staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny Meyer, the owner of Gramercy Tavern, Union Square Cafe,
Eleven Madison and Tabla, said he had decided to close his
restaurants after concluding that there was no way he could meet
``the overblown expectations'' that people were sure to bring in
the door. ``Somebody is not going to get the best table in the
restaurant,'' Meyer said. ``Someone is not going to like the size
of the piece of foie gras and the dollop of caviar or the band you
picked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be the best night out that you've ever had in your
life, or it's a failure,'' Meyer added. ``The evening is going to
cost so much money, and people are going to feel so ripped off
anyway, so why do it? If we weren't going to make money, if we
weren't going to make our guests happy, if we weren't going to make
our staff happy, then why open?''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, word that some restaurateurs are taking the
night off (or, like Le Cirque 2000, are opening but donating the
proceeds to charity) is stirring some resentment among those
restaurateurs who are looking forward to what has always been one
of the biggest moneymaking nights of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute they say, `We're not opening, we want to be fair to
our employees,' that is a really unfair thing to do to everyone
else,'' said Drew Nieporent, whose restaurants include Montrachet,
Nobu, Layla, TriBeCa Grill and Berkeley Bar and Grill. ``Also, to
create the charitable thing, I respect that, I really do. But we
live by the adage that the show must go on. This is an important
day for us. That's the way we pay our bills. If we all wanted to
play hooky on a major holiday, what would happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, closing on New Year's Eve could not have
been an easy decision, at least to judge by the menu prices that
have been announced so far. Lespinasse is charging $2,500 a person
for its late-night dinner, including wine and service. (If that's
too pricey, there's a discounted meal of just $1,700 a head, with a
more modest selection of wines.)
</P>
<P>
   Dinner at Daniel will be $1,250, plus wine. At Chanterelle,
Karen and David Waltuck are planning a black-tie dinner, which will
include a wine from each decade of the 20th century, at a cost of
around $2,500 a head. ``This only happens once in a while, right?''
Ms. Waltuck observed.'' It's a pretty big nut to crack for our
clients. But I figured I should go all out.'' (So far, reservations
can still be booked at most of these high-price restaurants.)
</P>
<P>
   It is also doubtful that any restaurant would have any problem
selling out: letting someone else do the work has always been the
best way to have fun on New Year's Eve. Sirio Maccioni, the owner
of Le Cirque 2000, said that 1,000 people had already called to put
themselves on his New Year's Eve waiting list, even though he has
yet to announce a single detail about the night, from menu to cost.
</P>
<P>
   But the economic incentives to open are less strong this year
than usual. For one, there's the expected high cost of supplies for
the night. For another, this has been a good year in the business,
which means that owners can afford to take a night off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a great year at Aquavit,'' said Hakan Swahn, the
owner of the Scandinavian restaurant in midtown. ``I feel the least
we can do is say to our staff that worked, `It's the millennium,
enjoy yourself: we'll see you in the next millennium.'''
</P>
<P>
   And the prospective profits are being weighed against a growing
concern among business owners in New York, who are beginning to
worry about just what the streets of Manhattan will be like that
evening. ``The level of clientele that we cater to is not going to
be frequenting Times Square on New Year's,'' said Franklin Becker,
the chef at Local on West 47th Street. ``The people that are going
to be here are going to be transients. They are going to be young
kids with ill motives that aren't going to be able to afford our
restaurant. Quite frankly, to put our guests at risks or to put
anyone at risk, including our employees, for one evening, it just
doesn't make any sense for us. We're putting braces behind the
windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Bastianich, an owner of Babbo, said he has not made a
decision on what, if anything, to do. ``Is the potential downside
worth the potential revenue?'' he asked. ``The danger to people? I
don't know what it's going to be like.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, for all the concern voiced by restaurant owners,
there does appear to be an ultimate factor nudging these
restaurateurs to spend the night someplace else. After all, this is
a millennial moment. Who wants to work?
</P>
<P>
   Vongerichten, for instance, is designing the menu for a
particularly large celebration at the Javits Center, but has no
plans to be near Manhattan that night. ``I never took off a New
Year's Eve,'' he said. ``I deserve it. I'm giving it to myself.''

   GRAFTON, Vt. _ (italics)Slap. Slap. Slap. Slap.(end italics)
It's the only sound made by the cheese makers as they go about
their work flipping 30-pound strips of glistening milk curds, the
color of rich cream, in stainless steel vats. On the first day of
autumn in this almost too perfect New England town, cheddaring is
under way at the Grafton Village Cheese Co. It is a magical process
that turns liquid into gold.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning into a vat, I catch a sweet milk aroma that has begun to
take on a slightly nutty fragrance. Scott Fletcher, the cheese
maker at the plant since it opened in 1963, lets me sample the warm
curd, and it has the soothing, delicate texture and taste of a
freshly made ball of mozzarella.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine that this mellowness will ever become the
pungent, extra-sharp, crumbly perfection that is sold as Vermont
Cheddar, America's best sharp cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Cheddar isn't just a noun and an adjective, but also a verb. In
the last instance, it describes the technique perfected in Cheddar,
in the West Country of England, for extracting the moisture (the
whey) from the solids (the curds) to make one of the world's
greatest cow's milk cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   In the dairy state of Vermont, cheddaring began in the early
1800s as a way for farmers to use up surplus milk, but today only a
few farmers are still at it. In part, this is a story of small
farms versus agribusiness, and nature versus science.
</P>
<P>
   But it does have a happy ending. On the palate.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont Cheddar is different from English Cheddar, but to cheese
experts like Steve Jenkins, who wrote ``Cheese Primer'' (Workman,
1996), they are equal.
</P>
<P>
   Making Cheddar cheese begins with warming the milk and adding
rennet, which is what causes curds to form. Soon the milk resembles
custard, which firms up and then can be cut with steel wires to
form thousands of one-inch squares. The whey separates from the
curd and is drained away. The curd, now with the appearance of
cottage cheese, is pushed to either side of the vat, where it
bonds, and cut into those 30-pound slabs.
</P>
<P>
   There will be several turnings and tests for acidity before the
cheese is ready for milling, when the slabs are cut into
finger-length strips. Salting, pressing, wrapping and aging follow.
The longer a Cheddar ages, the more intense the flavor and the
greater the price it can command _ a lot depends on the skill of
the cheese maker. In the meantime, it keeps money tied up,
something today's small dairy farmers cannot afford to do.
</P>
<P>
   As long ago as the early 1900s, improvements in transportation
and delivery allowed many farmers to begin marketing milk instead
of cheese and butter. Now, after years of consolidation, only
Grafton, the Cabot Cooperative Creamery in Cabot, Shelburne Farms
in Shelburne and the Seward Family Farm in East Wallingford make
Vermont Cheddar.
</P>
<P>
   Two others, Sugarbush Farm and Butterworks Farm, sell Vermont
Cheddar made for them by others. Add one goat Cheddar and two
mild-mannered Cheddar relatives _ Colby from Crowley in Healdville,
and the stirred curd cheese from the Plymouth Cheese Factory in
Plymouth _ and you have the sum total of Vermont Cheddar cheese.
</P>
<P>
   It is a cheese in great demand. As Americans have become more
sophisticated about food, they have become more interested in the
subtlety of complex flavors. In the early 1990s Grafton's most
popular cheese was the mild one-year-old Cheddar; today it is the
sharper two-year-old. Three-year-old is coming up fast, and there
is enough demand for four-year-old cheese that it will soon be part
of the company's repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four Cheddar makers, only Shelburne Farms and the Seward
Family Farm make farmstead cheeses using their own milk. Most
farmstead cheeses in Vermont (and there are more and more each
year) come from goats and sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Grafton's cheese making falls somewhere between the entirely
automated process at Cabot's Middlebury plant and the method used
by Butch Seward: feel, touch, smell and look. At Cabot, a family
farm cooperative that merged in 1992 with the largest dairy co-op
in the Northeast, Agri-Mark, ``the milk never sees the light of day
from the time it leaves the cow,'' a point of pride for Tom Harty,
the company's consumer communications manager. Others phrase it
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cabot's milk is never touched by human hands,'' said Peter
Mohn, Grafton's vice president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Cabot produces 55 million pounds of cheese a year. Grafton makes
1.2 million pounds, and by January will increase production to 1.5
million pounds. Shelburne Farms, which began making cheese in 1982,
produces less than 100,000 pounds. And the Seward Family Farm,
which has existed since the mid-1800s and has made cheese since
1938, produces only about 40,000 pounds of fresh cheese curd,
selling half of it outright and turning the rest into Cheddar.
</P>
<P>
   Grafton produced Cheddar from the 1890s until the plant burned
down in 1912. It did not start up again until the nonprofit Windham
Foundation began to restore the village center in Grafton in the
1960s. Like many small Vermont towns, Grafton went into a steep
decline as people went elsewhere in search of work. As part of the
restoration, it seemed logical to erect a cheese plant that would
help to employ people.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation also restored the Old Tavern, the inn in Grafton,
and about half of the hundred-plus houses and rented them out. The
rest are privately owned, but all are freshly painted and have
well-tended lawns and flower gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The town, which now has about 600 inhabitants, is every
flat-lander's fantasy of a typical Vermont setting, in much better
shape than most of them. The modern plant is slightly removed from
the 19th-century village, down a winding road beside a stream and
just past a covered bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Shelburne Farms, on the shore of Lake Champlain, has become an
agricultural trust and also benefits from the backing of a
nonprofit foundation. Seward, the only Cheddar processor without
the resources of the big three, is barely holding on. It once had
eight vats producing two batches a day each, but is now down to one
vat every two or three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were once the third- or fourth-largest creamery in the
state,'' Seward said as he stirred curd in the vat. ``Now we're
down to nothing. Big business just started choking us.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the difficulty of competing, Vermont's Agriculture
Department, which helps farmers looking for any way to earn a
living that will permit them to stay on the farm, recommends that
they make their cow's milk into other cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take the blame,'' said Elisa Clancy, the dairy marketing
specialist for the department. ``It's one of the reasons we don't
have a lot of farmstead Cheddars. I tell them it's easier to be the
new kid on the block with a fontina rather than a Cheddar. Why
compete with a Shelburne or a Cabot or a Grafton?''
</P>
<P>
   Grafton, in a bow to efficiency that speeds up the cheese making
process, heat-treats the milk before it goes into the vats. Purists
say this compromises the taste of the cheese because it kills some
of the bacteria and destroys some of the aromatic esters that give
subtlety to the cheese. Others say it prevents the ``off'' flavors
sometimes found in raw-milk cheese and yields a more consistent
product.
</P>
<P>
   Pasteurization, which requires a higher temperature, destroys
all bacteria and esters, leaving the cheese more one-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pasteurization is the death of milk and therefore the death of
cheese,'' said Jenkins, the cheese expert and writer.
</P>
<P>
   Shelburne's Cheddar is made from raw milk. Cabot, like Seward,
uses pasteurized milk. Harty said Cabot began pasteurizing four
years ago because of potential problems from harmful bacteria and
also to get fresh Cheddar to market earlier. Unpasteurized cheese
must be aged at least 60 days before it can be sold. Harty said
there is ``absolutely no difference in taste.'' Some processors
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Cheese makers also disagree on the bovine growth hormone
question. The state passed a law requiring all dairy producers to
label their products either ``rBGH free'' or ``contains rBGH.'' The
law was overturned in court but is still a sore subject.
</P>
<P>
   Of the big three Cheddar cheese makers, only Cabot refuses to
certify its milk as rBGH-free. Labeling cheese as rBGH-free is
``morally objectionable,'' Harty said, adding, ``It is immoral and
misleading to give consumers false assurance, because you cannot
scientifically prove or disprove the presence of rBGH.''
</P>
<P>
   Grafton, on the other hand, gets affidavits from its suppliers
swearing they use no growth hormone. Shelburne and Seward do not
use the hormone in their cows.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the aging of Vermont Cheddars is done in Cryovac
packaging because the old paraffin-lined foil wrap once used by
cheese makers is no longer available. ``I would prefer it,'' said
Mohn of Grafton, ``because aging in Cryovac may not be the best
way. Logically, when you age in Cryovac there should be some flavor
transference from the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other way to age Cheddar is in a cloth in a cave, the
method Shelburne Farms adopted two years ago. Cloth wrapping
produces a Cheddar closer to the English style, with flavors that
some consider ``off'' but that others seek out: grass, hay, corn,
fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The cheeses also tend to be drier, more crumbly and sharper,
because they have been aged longer and often have bits of a grainy
substance that is some of the amino acid that develops as the
cheese ages. Shelburne charges much more for this cheese, its pride
and joy, than for its top cheese aged in plastic, because it
requires so much more handling.
</P>
<P>
   Cabot also ages 23-pound wheels in cloth for about a year and
calls them Hunter's, selling the cheese to country stores where, by
tradition, huge wheels of ``rat cheese'' have always been kept on
the counter under glass (plastic now), with wedges hacked off as
customers request them. Cabot sells Hunter's for less than its best
cheeses because it considers them less than desirable.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the Seward solution: selling salted strips of
curd before they are turned into cheese. Chewing on what is called
squeaky curd or squeaky cheese is a favorite pastime of Vermonters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way you can stay in the cheese business is to have
some specialty,'' Seward said. ``The cash flow is a hell of a lot
better than putting it on the shelf for a year.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vermont Cheddars vary widely in flavor, but the fine aged ones
should be treated like a fine Stilton. Serve at room temperature,
and savor them in small bites. Instead of port, choose either a
robust red like sangiovese or Barolo, a big cabernet sauvignon or
merlot, a spicy zinfandel, a gewurztraminer or a riesling.
</P>

   LOS ANGELES _ It plays in a college auditorium, not a barn, and
the stars are David and Lea, not Mickey and Judy. But the hottest
ticket in Tinseltown these days has all the slapdash bravado of the
craziest ``Let's put on a show'' plot. With 64 hours of rehearsal
and pittance for pay, a cast of Broadway and television veterans
plus five UCLA students are romping through a semistaged version of
``The Boys From Syracuse,'' Rodgers and Hart's 1938 musical sendup
of mistaken identity in ancient Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bravery and insanity,'' said the director, Arthur Allan
Seidelman, summing up the qualities needed for Reprise: Broadway's
Best in Concert, a West Coast answer to the New York City Center's
Encores series of limited-run concert revivals of vintage musicals.
Encores did ``The Boys'' in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its third season, Reprise has drawn some of television's
most popular stars, including Jason Alexander of ``Seinfeld'' and
Kelsey Grammer of ``Frasier.'' Its current production, running
through Sunday, stars Grammer's deadpan co-star, David Hyde Pierce,
and Lea DeLaria, the comic singer who made a splash as Hildy the
taxi driver in the recent Broadway revival of ``On the Town.''
</P>
<P>
   For Pierce, it's his first musical comedy experience since a
junior high school production of ``You're a Good Man, Charlie
Brown,'' in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and a stint in ``HMS Pinafore''
in his first term at Yale. He is beginning his seventh season in
his Emmy-award winning role as Dr. Niles Crane on NBC's
``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although that's not a musical,'' Pierce said dryly as he
stretched on the floor of the Freud Playhouse on the University of
California Los Angeles campus in a Reprise rehearsal the other day.
``This is more elaborate, more concentrated, more sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeLaria, who grew up as a showboat performer on the
Mississippi River and then became the first openly lesbian comic to
appear on national television, took the role of Marryin' Sam in
City Center's Encores production of ``Li'l Abner.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Syracuse,'' with a score that includes ``Falling in Love
With Love'' and ``This Can't Be Love,'' is ``a little different
because there you hold your script and it's more a staged
reading,'' she said. ``This is really just a less-produced version
of a full play.''
</P>
<P>
   The series' musical director is Peter Matz, the conductor and
arranger who helped shape the sound of singers from Dietrich to
Streisand and spent eight years leading Carol Burnett's band on
television. The drill is the same for each show: a week of frantic
rehearsal, then 14 performances scheduled to accommodate the stars'
taping schedules. Virtually every performance has sold out in a
city not generally thought of as a theater town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, there's such a great talent pool here,'' said
Matz, who earned an engineering degree at UCLA, began his Broadway
career 45 years ago as a rehearsal pianist and arranger for Harold
Arlen and Truman Capote's musical, ``House of Flowers,'' and has
since become a mainstay of the pop music business here. ``The
biggest change I see is that you used to have a singing group and a
dancing group in a show. Now, everybody that sings dances, and vice
versa.''
</P>
<P>
   Reprise was founded in 1995 by Marcia Seligson, a former
magazine journalist and producer of live events for charity who
grew up in New York on musicals like the original ``Annie Get Your
Gun'' with Ethel Merman. She says she has stopped saying that
Reprise' was not inspired by Encores. No one believes her, but her
first inspiration was actually a local troupe, L.A. Theater Works,
which records classic plays for radio performance with stars like
Richard Dreyfuss and JoBeth Williams. Once Ms. Seligson learned of
the program at City Center, however, she consulted Judith Daykin,
its president, and wound up modeling Reprise closely on its East
Coast counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ``My appetite for theater has always been more than the
availability here,'' said Ms. Seligson, who moved here more than 25
years ago after coming to write a piece for Life magazine about the
filming of ``Catch-22.'' Her first move was to try to line up some
stars, and she got the home number of Alexander, an old Broadway
baby, from a friend. He proposed several possibilities, including
``Promises, Promises,'' the seldom-seen 1968 Burt Bacharach-Hal
David version of Billy Wilder's film ``The Apartment.'' The
musical's best-known number is ``I'll Never Fall in Love Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Through another friend, Ms. Seligson arranged lunch with Matz to
seek his advice about music directors. ``He said, ``I hope you're
going to ask me,''' Ms. Seligson recalled, ``and I just burst into
tears.'' It took two years, until the spring of 1997, to
incorporate as a nonprofit organization, assemble a board and get
things up and running, with Jean Smart, the dizzy blonde of
``Designing Women,'' joining Alexander in ``Promises'' to smash
reviews for just seven performances that May.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole first season we totally sold out through
subscriptions,'' Ms. Seligson said, though the group ran a deficit
on every show and had to make up the difference with fund-raising.
Alexander had so much fun that he suggested repeating the show with
the same cast for 14 more performances that fall, earning enough
money to stay in business for more productions. These included
Stephanie Zimbalist and Lucie Arnaz in ``Wonderful Town,'' and
``Finian's Rainbow,'' with Malcolm Gets of ``Caroline in the City''
as the Leprechaun.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring the group made enough to keep going for another
season with a special run of Grammer and Christine Baranski in
``Sweeney Todd'' in the far larger Ahmanson Theater at the Los
Angeles Music Center, and followed up at UCLA in May with ``Bells
Are Ringing,'' starring Carolee Carmello, fresh from her glowing
reviews in the Broadway flop ``Parade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiorello,'' not yet cast, opens in November. Matz and
Seidelman said they hope to do Jerry Herman's ``Mack and Mabel''
with a new book sometime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce came to his role as Dromio of Syracuse, one of twin
slaves of twin brothers who bumble through George Abbott's
adaptation of Shakespeare's ``Comedy of Errors,'' by way of Matz's
wife, the cabaret singer Marilynn Lovell Matz, with whom he
performed at an AIDS benefit several years ago. ``They found a song
that you could basically Rex Harrison your way through and not have
to be a real singer,'' Pierce said. ``She encouraged me to do one
of these shows, and I said, `Well, yeah, maybe someday.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now Pierce, who has a sweet, true light baritone, is working
with a singing coach and envying Ms. DeLaria's powerful belt as the
man-hungry Luce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lea needs no coach,'' he said as the two took a dinner break
of pizza from a box the other night. ``She just needs a big sock
over her head to bring the volume down so she doesn't blow me off
the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeLaria jumped in: ``After hearing me sing, David's actually
invited me over to his house to get rid of his spiders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And skunks!'' Pierce interjected. ``It's amazing. She does
`Rose's Turn,' and they just leave.''

IN RIO, A NEIGHBORHOOD PROUDLY EMBRACES U.S. MALL CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif.) (nk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ This city's most conspicuous symbol has
always been the giant statue of Christ that stands atop Corcovado
mountain. But out in the Barra da Tijuca, the part of town where
Rio's newly moneyed reign, a rival is now being erected: an
88-foot-high replica of the Statue of Liberty made of plastic and
fiberglass.
</P>
<P>
   In a neighborhood that already boasts a pair of apartment
buildings that resemble upright versions of the Leaning Tower of
Pisa, the structure going up at the entrance to a new entertainment
mall called the New York City Center probably should surprise no
one.
</P>
<P>
   But to the guardians of established values here, so blatant an
act of homage to the United States comes as an affront, proof that
the 200,000 or so residents of the Barra are a different,
embarrassing breed of Brazilian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Barra da Tijuca can now be deemed the most ridiculous
place in the world, exceeding even Miami,'' a newspaper columnist,
Tutty Vasques, wrote in Jornal do Brasil, a leading daily here.
``Bad taste is going unchecked and is careering out of control down
the Avenida das Americas,'' the main street of the district,
turning the Barra into ``something that makes even the new rich
feel ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Separated from the rest of Rio by a ridge of mountains, Barra da
Tijuca barely existed 20 years ago but is now the fastest growing
area of the city that has always set the cultural pace for the rest
of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   While Rio's traditional neighborhoods recall Lisbon, Rome or
Paris, the atmosphere in Barra da Tijuca is more like that of
American Sun Belt cities like Los Angeles, Phoenix, Houston or
Miami _ and deliberately so.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another country out here, one that takes Los Angeles
as its model,'' said Jose Maria Herdy de Barros, acting president
of the Barra Association of Commerce and Industry, which represents
more than 700 businesses in the area. ``What we have tried to do is
copy the best things about the United States without adopting the
bad things.''
</P>
<P>
   To the dismay of Brazilian nationalists, the good things
apparently include the English language, as evidenced by malls
called Barra Shopping, Barra Garden, Barra Point and Barra Square.
</P>
<P>
   Residents shop at stores _ some advertising ``sales'' instead of
the equivalent Portuguese word _ called World Top Lock, Bike Box,
Bad Kid, Royal Canine, Fight Center, Water Planet and Fast Way. And
they live in apartment buildings with names like Oceanfront and
Golden Green.
</P>
<P>
   While that sort of thing may be common in the rest of Latin
America, it has not always been so here. Brazil's elite has
traditionally had an ambivalent attitude toward the United States
but adores all things French, which helps explain the profusion of
luxury beachfront apartment buildings here that have names like
Maison du Soleil and Chateau d'Amboise or that honor French
cultural icons like Mallarme, Baudelaire and Degas.
</P>
<P>
   The Barra da Tijuca, on the other hand, is the domain of a new
class of self-made men and women who in the last five years have
come to be called the emergentes. The word literally means ``the
emerging ones'' but is often used in a pejorative sense, especially
by those who inherited their wealth, to mean something like social
climber, nouveau riche or arriviste.
</P>
<P>
   If any one person represents the Barra da Tijuca and the
emergentes in the public mind, it is probably Vera Loyola, 52, the
owner of a chain of restaurants and bakeries who proudly describes
herself as ``the muse of the new society.''
</P>
<P>
   A flashy character in a recent television soap opera was
inspired by her, and the business magazine Dinheiro has described
her as ``a successful businesswoman who makes exaggeration a
powerful marketing tool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that you can only get culture from going to Europe is
really just so out of date,'' Ms. Loyola said in an interview at
her home, which is decorated with porcelain vases and paintings
that include a large self-portrait. ``There is no reason to hide
the fact that you like to go to Miami or that you feel more
comfortable being among Americans than with the French.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a 400-year-old name, and I don't feel there is
any reason to admire those who do. I worked to get where I am, and
I'm not afraid to admit it. I'm real, I'm authentic, and if high
society can't handle that, it's their problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Emergentes, as Ms. Loyola explained it, would rather go skiing
at Aspen than Gstaad, and even when they travel to Europe they
prefer, like her, to stay in American chain hotels, because ``they
are more modern and comfortable'' than their local European rivals.
She even dispenses such advice on behavior and fashion to fellow
emergentes in a weekly newspaper column in none other than Jornal
do Brasil.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just the fusty elite that looks down on the Barra
and its residents. Many middle-class residents of Rio also complain
that the area feels alien to them when they venture past the huge
``Smile, You're in the Barra'' sign that greets visitors and into
the malls and multiplexes that have largely displaced Rio's
traditional entertainment and shopping sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sterile out there, like a desert,'' said Waldir Carvalho
Gouveia, an engineer and resident of Ipanema. ``That place is so
Americanized that there aren't even corner bars where you can hang
out, and you can't get from one place to another without a car,
because they don't have sidewalks anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Barra residents, in turn, have their own set of complaints about
the way the city treats them. Resentment runs so high that a
movement to separate from the rest of Rio and become an independent
municipality emerged about a decade ago. The complaint was that the
neighborhood was paying too much in taxes and not getting enough
back in public services.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, though, the city's center of gravity is clearly
shifting to the Barra. Rio's mayor, who was born in the Leblon
district, now lives in the Barra. The country's leading television
network has moved its main production studio there, which has
encouraged its biggest stars to buy houses nearby. And the American
Consulate, which has occupied the same downtown office building
since the days when Rio de Janeiro was Brazil's capital, is also
contemplating a move.
</P>
<P>
   With the Barra's population expected to grow to one million
within two decades, some residents hope that all the carping will
keep newcomers away. The Barra way of life is so delicious, they
say, that even those who mock and claim to shun it in reality
secretly crave it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, they're just jealous,'' said Soraya da Matta, a doctor who
moved her practice and her family to the Barra from the
lower-middle-class neighborhood of Meier nearly 15 years ago.
``We've got more space for our kids out here, less crime and
traffic, and a lot of shopping centers and entertainment close at
hand. We have a better quality of life, and the old fogies know
that and resent it.''

 &HT;    A THIRD OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES SAID TO LACK PRESCRIPTION DRUG
COVERAGE
 &HT;    By SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly one-third of the nation's Medicare
beneficiaries have no prescription drug coverage, a House panel was
told Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In rural areas, the percentage of seniors without coverage is
suspected to be greater, said Michael Hash, deputy administrator
for the Health Care Financing Administration, the federal agency
that overseas Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress considering how to reform Medicare, proponents and
opponents of expanding the program to include prescription drug
coverage clashed at a hearing of the subcommittee on health and
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind it is unconscionable to ask the neediest
beneficiaries to wait for prescription drugs while we continue to
debate the broader problems facing the Medicare program,'' said
subcommittee chairman Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But Gail Wilensky, a former HCFA administrator who is now with
Project Hope, the humanitarian group, argued that to add a drug
benefit which ``would substantially increase the spending needs of
a program that is already financially fragile without addressing
other issues of reform is a bad idea.''
</P>
<P>
   While most Medicare beneficiaries have some drug coverage either
through supplemental ``Medigap'' policies or through
employer-sponsored benefits, the coverage is often inadequate
because of higher copayments, deductibles and premiums, Hash said.
</P>
<P>
   According to 1995 government estimates, Medicare beneficiaries
on average filled 18 prescriptions and spent $600 a year on drugs,
Laura Dummit, a Government Accounting Office analyst, told the
panel.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has proposed a plan that would add a voluntary
drug benefit option for Medicare beneficiaries that would pay half
the patient's monthly premiums and half the cost of prescriptions
up to $2,000 beginning in 2002 and increasing to $5,000 in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the administration plan warned it would give
government, managed care groups and drug companies too much control
over what medications Americans could receive.
</P>
<P>
   Wilensky noted there is disagreement about how much the
president's plan would cost. While the administration puts the cost
at $118 billion over the next ten years, the Congressional Budget
Office estimates it will take $168 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., suggested the president put more
pressure on the Food and Drug Administration to approve more
generic drugs that would be less expensive, urge drug manufacturers
and pharmaceutical groups to provide more group discounts and speak
to physicians about providing alternatives to expensive medications
for their patients.

what income they will have or will need. Many know little about
their pensions, if they have them. A large percentage think they
will be eligible for full Social Security benefits long before they
actually will. That does not mean that the unprepared will serve a
life sentence in the salt mines. It does mean they are in for some
brain-shaker surprises if they don't start working on the problem
before they get much older.Personal finance advice. (Ezell, Atlanta

they used during the week in practice sessions. They inflated balls

Healtheon's stock has soared to all time high at $105 and plunged
to a new low of $35. Meanwhile WebMD has continued to sign partners
buffing out its content offering. We'll update the status of the
deal. (Kanell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18.

   MONEYTALK _ A lot of us expect, or at least hope, that we can
retire before we reach age 65. Recent research, however, strongly
suggests that many of the hopefuls are talking through their hats.
They haven't invested very much, nor have they tried to estimate
what income they will have or will need. Many know little about
their pensions, if they have them. A large percentage think they
will be eligible for full Social Security benefits long before they
actually will. That does not mean that the unprepared will serve a
life sentence in the salt mines. It does mean they are in for some
brain-shaker surprises if they don't start working on the problem
before they get much older.Personal finance advice. (Ezell, Atlanta

   FBN-KICKERS _ The evidence is in: NFL place-kickers are
struggling this year because they no longer are allowed to inflate
and deface footballs to their personal specifications. In years
past, kickers were allowed to kick on Sundays with the same balls
they used during the week in practice sessions. They inflated balls
to suit weather conditions and scuffed up balls on cement to create

   UNDATED _ Every year at this time, the chalky, cedar-studded
hills around Granbury, Texas, become Civil War battlefields.
Hundreds of re-enactors dressed in their finest blues and grays
break out the muzzleloaders and face off against each other in mock
anger. The battles they re-create are those of Gen. Hiram B.
Granbury, the town's namesake. This year, beginning Saturday
morning, the troops will fall out to re-enact the 1864 battle for
Atlanta, and the Battle of Spring Hill, Tenn. By ART CHAPMAN. Story

the colorful, clumsy plumber has fumbled his way through more than
two-dozen games, all of which have been geared toward young
players. Even the complicated brain-buster Mario 64 is,
essentially, a kid's game. That's why it's so surprising that Mario
Golf (Nintendo for N64, $50, all ages) is so difficult. This is the
first Mario game that, unlike all the other Mario-theme sports
titles, you can't just pick up and start playing. Well, you can,
but you're gonna have a tough time with it. By MALCOLM MAYHEW.

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The public-address system is an essential feature of today's
birthday parties for kids. Across the requisite loudspeaker come
messages like the following: ``Everyone here for Tiffany's birthday
party, please report to Party Room 3 for cake, ice cream and
presents,'' or some such.
</P>
<P>
   Only then do Tiffany's little friends slide from the tunnels and
pry themselves from the video games, to actually come together and
pay homage to the birthday girl. It's an obligation, this amplified
call to duty, the price a kid has to pay for free admission and a
pouch full of game tokens handed out by the party hosts. Tiffany
and her birthday are pretty much afterthoughts. How can something
so quaint compare with the adrenaline rush of killing space
invaders in the arcade?
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I feel something has been lost as birthday parties
have moved from the living room to the amusement house. Birthday
parties were once an excuse for kids to get together ``and stay
together'' in fairly large numbers _ to have a blast away from the
burdensome rules of the classroom. Birthday parties were once about
making a boy or a girl the absolute center of attention for a
morning or an afternoon, a prince or princess for a day.
</P>
<P>
   But now kids are summoned over the loudspeaker, and a stranger,
albeit a cheery teen-ager in a funny hat, lights the candles in the
party room, and the presents are ripped through so the kids can
rush back out into the amusement jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. Places like the Discovery Zone are great for
rainy days. I've spent some time in the tunnels myself. (Always use
the kneepads.) But in my book, birthday parties belong at home, or
in a park, with the kids together and a pinata hung from the branch
of a tree. It seems no small feat that the depersonalization of our
world extends to even this.
</P>
<P>
   There are downsides to a party at home. The work involved, for
one thing. Balloons to be blown up and hung with the crepe paper;
pizzas and cake ordered (or made). Then, when the proverbial dust
has cleared, the cleanup, with no perky teen-agers in funny hats
around to help.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the matter of a party game plan, figuring out
stuff for kids to do. This was not a problem for my son's party in
July, for we are blessed with a small swimming pool in our back
yard. Ten boys were happily captive there for several hours. That,
plus a few pieces of pizza, cake and ice cream, and the opening of
presents and you have your basic boffo birthday bash, memories of
which still cause my 8-year-old to smile. All of his best buddies
were there. They played together all day. He was made to feel a
king.
</P>
<P>
   Those without pools or without other built-in diversions face a
bigger challenge. Bobbing for apples no longer is really an option
(was it ever?). Nor is pin the tail on the donkey (am I really that
old?). But there are books out there with plenty of good ideas for
home parties. Further, I'm of the opinion that if you throw 10
young friends together under one roof, or out in the back yard,
they'll think of something. Just make sure that anything breakable
is put away first.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that having your child's birthday party at
home precludes a certain amount of extravagance. I submit the
recent party of Sam, son of Steve and Julie, as an example.
</P>
<P>
   At this memorable fete, Tharpo the Clown took the place of
bobbing for apples. Mom's Hallmark moment came when Tharpo costumed
her beaming 5-year-old with a balloon hat, balloon sword and
balloon holster for the dagger, and a balloon parrot for Sam's
shoulder. For the balance of his hourlong performance, Tharpo told
jokes, juggled balls and was heckled by his young audience. Then
came the so-called big trick, which the clown performed after
repeatedly warning his audience not to try this at home. While
standing on a small teeter-totter, and balancing a glass of water
on his forehead, Tharpo juggled three machetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was in our family room,'' Steve told me later, still
incredulous.
</P>
<P>
   So it's a good bet Sam will remember being 5. He was at home,
his good friends all around, Tharpo the Clown defying death. A
prince for a day. As birthday parties go, no amusement house _ with
its PA system, its arcade, its maze of tunnels _ could possibly
compete.

CANCER SURVIVORS GATHER TO SEW, NOT TO WEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KRIS WORRELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ They talk about blind stitches and borders. They
talk about lattice stitches and layers.
</P>
<P>
   And, occasionally, they talk about the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The eight women who have come together at Albany Medical Center
to create a large, colorful quilt have all been touched by the
disease, seven as survivors and one as a caretaker. But they don't
come to weep. They come to sew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want a group that talked about the illness,'' says
Marilyn Seidenberg, 57, a breast cancer survivor. ``I joined one
group and they really talked about what they were going through,
and I couldn't do that. I would come out depressed. Because I
didn't want to dwell on it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't talk about our illness each week here. We just
focused on this,'' she says, pointing to the beautiful wall-hanging
quilt, a lively kaleidoscope of color, ribbon, soft sculpture,
feathers and applique.
</P>
<P>
   The women are part of a workshop organized by Pen &AMP; Palette, a
nonprofit organization here that uses the visual and written arts
to raise awareness of the issues of cancer survivorship. The
project has been funded in part by a grant from the Susan G. Komen
Breast Cancer Foundation with money raised at the Albany Race for
the Cure, and by the United Order True Sisters Inc. Abigail No. 3,
a national women's charitable organization.
</P>
<P>
   The quilt, called ``Woman Healing into Wholeness,'' has 12
panels, each different from the next but all cohesive, form the
quilt, which is about 6-feet by 6-feet in size.
</P>
<P>
   At the center is a woman with six arms, a serene face and a bald
head. Water billows up from the bottom and washes onto the woman's
feet. Red and purple flowers encircle her neck and wrists. Stars
and tiny angels swirl through the ocean of pale clouds around her
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a group effort,'' says Margaret Roberts, a free-lance
designer who founded Pen &AMP; Palette in 1995 after losing a sister to
breast cancer. ``A couple of people came up with the idea of having
six different arms because it takes a lot of juggling to cope with
cancer. We thought of the woman being grounded in water and earth,
so we decided to use earth colors and blues. And we thought of her
as rising out of these more murky, chaotic shapes into an open air,
more hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   The group began the quilt last March, meeting once or twice a
month and working individually at home. And although some members
dropped out along the way, others joined, so there were always
hands ready to do the work. Each woman designed and sewed her own
panel _ some by machine, some by hand _ and incorporated symbols
that had personal meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to put gold hair on it,'' explains Jeanette
Pace, a retired art teacher who made the woman's face. ``And I
said, `I need it bald,' because the thing that bothered me more
than anything was losing my hair. It's not an easy thing to look at
yourself for so many years and then all of a sudden it's no longer
there. You're different.''
</P>
<P>
   Pace, 63, was diagnosed in March 1998 with a rare form of
leukemia. By May, she had lost all her hair from chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this means cancer: no hair,'' she says. After eight
months of chemotherapy, there was no sign of Pace's cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 80 percent chromosomes that were abnormal in March, they
were 100 percent normal in November,'' says Pace, who now has a
healthy crop of gray hair. ``I went out and bought myself a sewing
machine the very next day.''
</P>
<P>
   For these women, the quilt is a symbol of both a personal
struggle and a group triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Seidenberg says the women have a positive attitude. ``It's not
the cancer that brings us together. We don't hang around toxic
people who sit there every week and complain, `Oh, I'm going
through such hell.'
</P>
<P>
   Pace, while pinning a swatch of fabric on the quilt, shakes her
head vigorously. ``No, no. Our whole thing is, we're doers. We're
going to get this done, we're going to get other things done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who gave me a story about someone with cancer, I would
look ahead to what was at the end of it,'' continues Pace. ``And if
this person died, I wouldn't read it. I want to hear about people
healing. Because there are so many who have healed out there.''

   CHINA-MAO _ BEIJING _ The Vanishing Mao. What's behind the minor
role to which Chairman Mao Tse-tung has been relegated in the
pre-anniversary propaganda. We're going to be watching: What is the
role of the man who masterminded the revolution in its anniversary
celebration? After 50 years, the cult has been quashed, the
mistakes of Mao are admitted openly (the Great Leap Forward, the
Cultural Revolution), and the great national savior has diminished.
Now he is given less credit than the late leader Deng Xiaoping.

   GINGRICH-MONEY _ ATLANTA _ With a flurry of direct mail and a
decisive vision for the future, private citizen Newt Gingrich's new
political action committee raised more than $1 million the first
half of this year. But a July divorce declaration in Cobb County
and rumors of an affair with a 33-year-old congressional aid could
put Gingrich's future fund-raising exploits at risk. Grass-roots
donors to Friends of Newt Gingrich PAC, especially older donors,
say Gingrich's personal life disappoints them, so much so that they
aren't likely to open their pockets to his causes again. ``There's
too much monkey business out there and that just shows he's one of
them,'' said George Boomer, a 79-year-old retiree from Minnesota
who gave FONG $300 early this year. (Stanford, Atlanta

without coverage is suspected to be greater, said Michael Hash,

to an embargoed copy of a NAEP report on the biggest writing test
in U.S. history, which the Department of Education is to release at

   FOSTERCARE _ These are boom times in foster care and many child
advocates say the government is at fault. ``Money drives policy,''
said U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, considered on Capitol Hill to
be an expert on issues affecting children. He and others complain
that agencies have little incentive to take kids out of foster care
because of the federal government's open-ended commitment to pay
the bills no matter how long a child remains in the system. (Dayton

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Showers are likely Wednesday from the central Appalachians
through the Middle Atlantic states as a potent cold front pushing
through the Ohio Valley interacts with humid air in place over much
of the East. Some of the showers will be very heavy at times. Total
precipitation amounts by Thursday morning could be as much as 3
inches, with local flooding possible.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, behind the front, an area of cold rain will
overspread the upper Ohio Valley and the eastern Great Lakes. It
will also turn noticeably cooler as brisk winds from the northwest
usher in colder, less humid air. This crisp, Canadian air mass led
to a very chilly start Wednesday morning over the northern Plains
and even led to numerous record low temperatures in the
inter-mountain west Tuesday morning. Ample sun, however, will allow
afternoon readings in the western Dakotas to become very warm.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will be lifted by
the tail end of a cold front, leading to scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the Gulf Coast into interior sections of Alabama
and Georgia. Florida will remain warm and humid with isolated
storms possible. There will also be a few showers in south Texas as
tropical moisture moves north from the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Following the first snow of the season for parts of the Colorado
Rockies on Tuesday, temperatures will rebound into the 60s
Wednesday as winds descend the mountains and warm. Farther west,
offshore flow will promote very warm readings in California, while
the Northwest will remain sunny and mild. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Autumn Snow &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grassy surfaces were whitened around Denver on Tuesday, while 4
inches of snow were measured in Cheyenne, Wyo. In most years, the
first snowflakes of the winter season reach these high-elevation
Western towns during late September when the relatively moist air
of the warm season combines with the first pools of chill from
northern latitudes. During winter, when the coldest air arrives in
the region, the supply of moisture is meager. As a result both,
Denver and Cheyenne exhibit maximal snowfall in fall and spring
with a relative minimum in winter. &QL;

`COLONY GIRL': NEARLY 15 AND READY FOR BUST-OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is an intersession that spans late childhood, when we are
experts at life so far, and early adolescence, when expertise
crumbles trying to find a way into the mysteries threatened by life
to come.
</P>
<P>
   It can be the time of a singular brief lucidity, a flash of
undeflected light just before the cloudy refractions of growing up.
It is a great watershed, and great novels have been written around
it: ``Huckleberry Finn,'' ``The Catcher in the Rye,'' J.G.
Ballard's ``Empire of the Sun,'' Marianne Wiggins' ``John Dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Various as these are, and none entirely fitting what has just
been said, they have one thing in common. They take the
child/adolescent out of adult protection and plunge him or her,
generally alone, into a foreign or at least unfamiliar world.
</P>
<P>
   For Huck it was life and death along the Mississippi and his
encounter, half a raft-length away, with Jim and slavery. For
Holden Caulfield it was a journey both out and in, though briefer
and less adventurous. For the boy in ``Empire'' it was life without
parents in a Japanese prison camp; for the children in ``John
Dollar'' it was being marooned on an island off Burma.
</P>
<P>
   The strangeness had a function. It forced the protagonist,
unprotected and unclouded by the familiar, to name life. It is a
hieratic power. Was the important thing about Eden that Adam and
Eve lived there or that they gave names to what lived there _ a
second act of Creation? Huck, Holden and the children in ``Empire''
and ``John Dollar'' open their eyes in an Edenlike newness (and in
some cases horror) and begin naming and creating.
</P>
<P>
   Here is another dazzling namer: Eve, the girl in ``Colony
Girl.'' She is nearly 15, a little older than the others. Living in
the Colony, an isolated religious commune in Iowa ruled by an
eccentric charismatic, she developed more slowly than they did.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is ready for bust-out, and Thomas Rayfiel's winning,
original and supremely intelligent novel follows it. Eve is
explorer and adventurer in transit between two countries: the
Colony, once familiar and now, to her maturing eyes, turned
foreign; and the world just outside, which she seizes on with the
wacky lucidity of a bright visitor from very far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colony Girl'' deals with two utterly different aspects of
Eve's traveling. There is the Colony and Gordon, its leader, who
subjects his followers to Spartan discipline while indulging
himself and getting rich. A dark portrait, by rights, yet tempered
by writing's power to make a thing not only itself but something
else besides.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, while Eve struggles to figure it all out, she
keeps sneaking into Arhat, the nearby town, to puzzle out a whole
other world: men, sex, love, the dazzlements of secular America,
and her own burgeoning powers.
</P>
<P>
   It should all be too much; too forced a juxtaposition and too
vulnerable to easy comedy or melodrama. Yet for all its gaudy
pattern, ``Colony Girl'' is seamless. Its most comic, hapless or
corrupt characters _ sometimes all three at once _ are no
caricatures. Eve's incandescent eye both etches and warms.
</P>
<P>
   What the book is most truly about is not, in fact, such matters
as Eve's falling in love simultaneously with a boy and his father,
or working on a road gang, or performing a striptease in a bar, or
burrowing into the Colony's secrets and breaking free by
threatening to expose Gordon's crooked arrangements with a town
official. What it is truly about is adolescent discovery and the
corkscrew byways that lead to it.
</P>
<P>
   Tying it all together is the tittuping flow of Eve's speculative
and wonderfully discordant narration. It is a stream that makes her
mishaps and odd victories into a journey and not just sights along
the way. No Mississippi runs through Arhat, Iowa, but here as in
``Huckleberry Finn'' the real river is the narrator's voice. What a
voice it is.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are her late-night chats with Gordon, sympathetically
indulgent of her probing, as if he, the great fraud, needed
occasional infusions of innocence. (Religious belief is not his
job, he tells her: It spoils his performer's concentration. ``Did
Jesus believe? I don't think so. He was too busy walking on the
water.'')
</P>
<P>
   There is her bungled effort to ``rescue'' a teen-age friend from
marrying Gordon. There is her never-quite-consummated affair with
Joey, a hunk who arouses her sexuality but is too timid to make use
of it. Also too dumb. He had a beautifully muscled back, she
reflects; more expressive, in fact, than his face.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly odder is her crush on Joey's father, a plump,
depressed widower. Only ostensibly; when she gets sickeningly drunk
at his son's party _ her first-time escape from the Colony _ his
kindness suggests that for a refugee the world can be a refuge. As
she clings to a tree he comes over to help.
</P>
<P>
   ```Herb.' He held out his hand. `Herb Biswanger.'
</P>
<P>
   ```Eve,' I answered, and substituted him for the tree trunk,
falling against his soft side.
</P>
<P>
   ``He braced himself to take me on, but didn't actually touch or
hold me. He just stood his ground while I slid down his shirtfront.
Finally I found his belt buckle and hung there.''
</P>
<P>
   He hoists her into his toolshed for a restorative blast from the
oxygen tank he keeps for his own shortness of breath. ``Everything
snapped into focus. My head was right on top of my body. Perfectly
centered. I looked down and saw how the rest of me all led up to
it, tapering to this one precious moment of being. I was a freshly
sharpened pencil.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately she begins to calculate how soon, since he is
middle-aged, they should start having babies. Gauzily ahead of the
game, that is, yet noting Herb's quick, involuntary glance at her
body, clad in a miniskirt that she had sneaked out of the Colony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave the same sort of look to his place,'' she says of his

TV REVIEW: HIGH SCHOOL HORRORS: THE COOL VS. THE UNCOOL
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review; second review, of CBS'
`Work With Me,' after production notes.)

   Nicole, the meanest of the cool blond girls at school, explains
the world to a friend. ``We live in the age of Gwyneth,'' she says,
``and that is the standard by which all things are judged.''
</P>
<P>
   You're not supposed to like Nicole (Tammy Lynn Michaels); she's
evil. A lot of viewers may not want to like ``Popular,'' WB's new
hourlong teen-age drama either, but the show is doing a lot of
things right. When was the last time a series started off with nine
complicated, well-developed characters, not including the colorful
faculty (Chad Lowe as Mr. Grant, for instance, saying ``My hair is
natural _ hey, I surf'')?
</P>
<P>
   The premise of ``Popular'' is that two very different high
school girls _ the popular Brooke (Leslie Bibb) and the unpopular
Sam (Carly Pope) _ are thrown together against their will when
Brooke's father and Sam's mother quickly meet, fall in love and get
engaged. But that doesn't happen until the end of the two-part
premiere (Wednesday night at 9 and Thursday night at 8). Before
that, Brooke and Sam have other encounters, beginning as lab
partners in biology class.
</P>
<P>
   The premiere's plot is mostly about a party at Brooke's house
that not everybody is invited to, a cool football player (Bryce
Johnson as Josh) who risks geekiness by auditioning for the class
musical and an overweight girl (Sara Rue, who is outstanding, as
Carmen) who probably won't make the cheerleading squad even though
she's clearly the most talented person trying out. Just to
demonstrate some interesting gender standards, Ron Lester plays
Sugar Daddy, a boy twice Carmen's size but part of the cool crowd,
maybe because of his hip-hop look and attitude. (All the young
stars of ``Popular'' are white, by the way.)
</P>
<P>
   The series is a little too literal and instructive at times,
especially when Sam is conducting her earnest video interviews.
Characters spell out the themes more than necessary, but they're
important themes, and the stories present adolescence as the
morally complex, emotionally draining experience it is.
</P>
<P>
   The show gives even blond queen-of-the-school Brooke more than a
few insecurities. Of course, this being Hollywood television, poor,
unpopular brunette Sam is every bit as much a knockout as Brooke
is; the blonde just gets the good lighting.

</P>
<P>
   CBS, Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. ET
</P>
<P>
   When Jordan Better (Kevin Pollak) quits his job at a large,
prestigious Wall Street law firm, he decides to join the tiny,
laid-back practice of his wife, Julie (Nancy Travis). But his
unglamorous new office doubles as the snack room and when he asks
about voice mail, Julie shouts ``Any messages?'' to his assistant.
(Things must be tough, since voice mail at home is now about $6 a
month.)
</P>
<P>
   So that's supposed to be the joke: how different life is at a
struggling little business. And just in case that isn't funny
enough, the joke is also that Jordan and Julie are now constantly
together, at home and at work, and that their respective
assistants, Stacey and Sebastian, are secretly dating each other.
The wacky neighbor is a masseur, or relaxation therapist.
</P>
<P>
   The first episode's conflict is Jordan's jealousy over Julie's
handsome on-the-make client Murray Epstein. This gives Jordan the
opportunity to make vulgar sexual remarks and gestures and gives
Julie the chance to threaten castration. ``Work With Me'' tries
very hard but it's sadly ordinary and a little tired.

NETWORKS FIND CAUSE FOR CHEER; THE QUIZ-SHOW GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the perspective of one full week of new shows, network
executives have already declared the new television season a
success. The big reason: The networks are down again in viewers,
but the decline is far less steep than it was last year at this
point.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound like even louder whistling than usual as the
networks try to navigate the boneyard, but they have a point.
Compared with their performance last season, when younger viewers
were fleeing the networks in such numbers that several of their
executives wanted to sue the Nielsen ratings company for
malfeasance, the networks were all but steady in that department in
this season's first week.
</P>
<P>
   This is being seen not only as solid proof of a resurgence in
Nielsen competence, but also as an indication that, if nothing
else, a new television season still seems to pull viewers back from
their summerlong dalliance with cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at those summer numbers,'' said Garth Ancier, the
president of NBC Entertainment, citing weeks when cable dominated
the repeats offered on the networks, ``and it's great to see people
coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   According to numbers released by NBC Tuesday, viewing among the
18-to-49-year-old crowd, which most of the networks are so devoted
to, was off by only 6 percent from premiere week last year. That's
for the big four networks; include the two not-as-big networks, the
drop was only 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Why is that so good? Because the executives at one network, Fox,
still don't seem to realize that it's late September and they
really should be back at school. Fox plodded away with mostly
repeats for the first week.
</P>
<P>
   And the biggest network show of all, ``E.R.,'' wasn't even on
last week, as it was in the first week last season. So that's two
big reasons why the week should have shown a much bigger falloff.
</P>
<P>
   One reason it didn't was a show that was not on last season, the
25th anniversary of ``Saturday Night Live'' on NBC. It was the
week's unqualified smash, dominating three hours of prime time
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   But every network (except Fox) had some good ratings news from
new shows last week. That good news came from hourlong dramas.
Nobody was talking about the new comedies, all of which attracted
laughter only of the derisive variety.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ``Stark Raving Mad,'' though it wound up the highest-rated
of the new shows, was already facing talk of being in trouble
because it fared worse than any other comedy NBC has put in the
plum 9:30 Thursday night period in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Among the big winners were ABC's ``Once and Again'' and CBS's
``Now and Again,'' which, besides making ``again'' the most popular
new title word of the season, were leaders in the trend toward
drama. Both shows beat all competition in their first time on the
air, truly unusual for new shows not placed between two hits.
</P>
<P>
   That ``Now and Again'' had the most young adult viewers on
Fridays at 9 was called the week's most amazing development by a
number of executives Tuesday because CBS so rarely leads in that
category.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, which was led by the extraordinary ``Saturday Night Live''
special and its remaining hits on Thursday, was the leading network
for the week in almost every category. The other boost NBC received
came from its own new dramas, three of which got off to strong
starts: ``The West Wing,'' ``Third Watch'' and ``Freaks and
Geeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The other thing that the strong batch of new dramas had in
common was mostly good critical reaction. Both ``Again'' shows got
almost all favorable reviews, as did ``Freaks and Geeks.'' NBC's
``West Wing'' and ``Third Watch'' also had a number of positive
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the shows savaged by critics, like ``Stark Raving
Mad'' and ``Mike O'Malley'' on NBC, were mostly rejected by
viewers. (And critics are rarely predictors of television success.)
</P>
<P>
   They certainly haven't been in the case of Fox's ``Action,'' the
season's most widely praised new comedy, which has all but
disappeared in three weeks on the air. On Thursday it finished in
fifth place, behind even UPN. But that's the night UPN has
wrestling, and that looks like a solid hit for that network (even
without helpful critical notices).
</P>
<P>
   Despite the generally good news for most networks last week,
there were areas of deep concern. ABC saw its Tuesday night
comedies lose badly to NBC, a development it surely did not expect.
``It's Like, You Know'' at 8:30 looks especially vulnerable because
NBC's ``Third Rock From the Sun'' made a bit of comeback and buried
it.
</P>
<P>
   But NBC's Monday comedies are nearing the life-support stage.
Both ``Suddenly Susan'' and ``Veronica's Closet'' have clearly worn
out their welcomes with viewers after years in which NBC force-fed
them to viewers. ``Susan'' looks as if it may be the most actively
disliked show on any of the big networks.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in its second try this season, it drove away almost 30
percent of its already woefully low number of viewers. The show
even trailed far behind repeats of ``That 70's Show'' on Fox. WB's
`'Seventh Heaven,'' that network's biggest hit, is also beating it
easily.
</P>
<P>
   The Quiz-Show Game
</P>
<P>
   Any time a new thoroughbred breaks out of the pack in network
television and looks like a hit, every other network wants to climb
on board _ not necessarily to ride so much as to beat the poor
horse to death.
</P>
<P>
   After ABC's success this summer with the game show ``Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire,'' NBC is making the first overt move in that
direction. The network said this week that it was commissioning a
pilot based on the format of the old game show ``Twenty-One.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that was one of the shows at the center of the quiz show
scandals in the 1950s, but NBC executive expressed confidence that
enough time has passed for that to make no difference with younger
viewers. For those old enough to remember, NBC seems to feel, the
notoriety just might help add an element of danger.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has tried to link the show with television's past in one
other way. Ancier said he had hired Fred Silverman, one of the
legendary programmers of television seasons past _ he made the top
program decisions first at CBS, then at ABC and finally at NBC in a
long career _ to put the pilot together.
</P>
<P>
   NBC executives said the game's format would generally be as it
was in the '50s, with categories of questions, and with the level
of difficulty determining whether the question was worth one point
or as many as 10. NBC said it had not decided whether the show
would be broadcast in prime time or daytime.

 &HT;    NBC the big winner in season-premiere contest
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC won the first week of the 1999 fall season, powered as
always by the return of its Thursday night lineup as well as a
strong showing by the 25th anniversary of ``Saturday Night Live''
Sunday night, which finished No. 3 for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Among new shows debuting with particularly high Nielsen ratings
during the networks' official premiere week, which ended Sunday:
``Once and Again'' on ABC (No. 14 for the week), NBC's ``Stark
Raving Mad'' at No. 9, NBC's ``West Wing'' at No. 13 and CBS's
``Family Law'' at No. 18. NBC's ``Third Watch'' ranked sixth for
the week when it premiered in ``ER's'' regular time slot, then
dropped to 25th when it moved to its regular time, 8 p.m. Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with last season's premiere week, NBC was the same in
ratings, CBS, Fox and ABC were down, the WB was up slightly, and
UPN was up a stunning 39 percent, due largely to WWF Wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new shows not performing well so far: Fox's
controversial comedy ``Action,'' which was hammered by NBC's
``Stark Raving Mad'' and dropped to only 5 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Other new series showing well included CBS's ``Ladies Man'' (No.
29) and ``Judging Amy'' (No. 30), ABC's ``Snoops'' (No. 33) and
CBS's ``Now and Again'' (No. 39).
</P>
<P>
   Although last week was the official premiere week, a number of
shows have yet to debut, and other series are settling into their
regular slots after special launches.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, NBC was No. 1 with an average of 14.5 million
viewers, followed by CBS with 14.2 million. ABC was third, followed
by Fox, WB and UPN.
</P>
<P>
   The following are the Nielsen Media Research ratings for the

 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ It is a perennial rite of college admissions
whose very existence is little known to frenzied parents and
applicants, but one so integral to the process that a prospect's
name scribbled on the back of the right business card there can
sometimes carry the weight of a high standardized test score.
</P>
<P>
   It is the annual conference of the National Association for
College Admission Counseling. And it convened here this past
weekend to provide many of the nation's high-school guidance
counselors and their counterparts in university admissions offices
with perhaps the only opportunity in the academic year to discuss
their respective wares, en masse.
</P>
<P>
   The course of those conversations _ in venues as public as a
convention hall and as secluded as a bathroom _ can affect nothing
less than an applicant's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an element of personal trust that builds up over the
years with these counselors,'' said Dr. William C. Hiss, a vice
president at Bates College, in Lewiston, Maine, who picked up a few
leads at the conference as he prepares to assemble the next class
at his school, which rejects two out of every three candidates.
``After a while, you realize certain counselors have great eyes for
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   First convened in 1945 with a handful of attendees, the
convention has ballooned in importance and size _ a record 1,500
guidance counselors and 1,400 admissions officers traveled to
Orlando _ in no small measure because the admissions gantlet has
perhaps never been more competitive or arduous.
</P>
<P>
   That competition has, at times, strained the famously clubby
atmosphere at such gatherings, with some high school counselors
complaining bitterly that their better students are not faring as
well in their acceptances as they might have several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, for representatives of lesser-known colleges, many
of them struggling just to fill their classrooms, NACAC, as the
gathering is called, offers an unparalleled chance to whisper the
names of their institutions in the ears of those who can influence
where seniors seek to spend the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   For guidance counselors, the convention represents the earliest
moment in the admissions season to talk up the names of forthcoming
applicants. And for the most selective institutions, NACAC,
pronounced knack-ack, has the feel of an informal academic draft
for top talent.
</P>
<P>
   Williams Fitzsimmons, the dean of admissions at Harvard _ who
was dutifully noting students' names, and sometimes their SAT
scores and extracurricular activities, on the backs of the
counselors' cards as they spoke _ said that the contact was
invaluable, particularly in anticipating potentially problematic
applicants.
</P>
<P>
   One guidance counselor from a California high school approached
Fitzsimmons with the name of a junior who, the counselor felt, was
``in the ballpark,'' except for a PSAT score of 1,200 out of a
possible 1,600, below the Harvard range. ``These are probably going
to go up,'' Fitzsimmons reassured, over the roar of a crowd that
sounded like a commodities market, his hands fingering a packet of
lozenges.
</P>
<P>
   Navigating between the long tables here, where 414 colleges had
draped their banners in booths no wider than four feet, Ivna
Gusmao, a college counselor at Chatsworth High School in Los
Angeles, was also on a targeted mission: she was looking for
universities with a special sensitivity to applicants with dyslexia
or attention deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Veverly Arrington, a new principal in Montgomery,
Ala., was sprinkling the college tables with oversized yellow
business cards announcing that her well-regarded magnet program, a
regular feeder to Stanford and Rice, had broken away from another
high school to form its own school, called Lamp. (``We already knew
about your move,'' John Albright, the senior associate director of
admissions at the University of Georgia, told her, proudly.)
</P>
<P>
   When they weren't huddling here at the Walt Disney World Swan
and Dolphin Resort, the counselors, like those at any convention,
had plenty of other distractions to compete for their attention.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hundreds of marketers and other businesses that hung
their shingles in an adjoining hall was the troupe Up with People,
star of Super Bowl half-time shows, which asked counselors to
encourage their students to join their company in a hiatus _ either
before entering college, or during it. Representatives from
McDonald's were there, too, looking for high-school-age cashiers
and college-graduates who might make good management trainees.
</P>
<P>
   And, if they wanted, the counselors could attend a semester's
worth of seminars, including ``Advising and recruiting the young
intellectual'' and ``Thorny conversations with demanding parents:
how to make them easier.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the attendees, the main draw was having time to make new
friends and renew old acquaintances across the divide between
secondary and higher education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of a huggy group,'' said Joyce F. Smith, the
executive director of the association. ``It makes it very
personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes too personal. Another member of the Bates delegation
said that he had been relieved that two guidance counselors whose
candidates were rejected last year had briskly walked by his booth,
apparently without noticing him.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Poch, the vice president and dean of admissions at Pomona
College in Claremont, Calif., said that he sensed similar tensions
crackling throughout the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the hugging is genuine,'' Poch said. ``But a lot of
the times, one person is reaching around the other to put the knife
in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Poch himself said he left the conference rather angry, when he
realized that such gatherings were increasingly giving yet another
edge to private and suburban schools, which are able to afford
plane tickets and hotel reservations, while more rural and
inner-city schools had to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Their absence has left plenty of space for a legion of private
college advisers, who are paid a premium by families to get their
children just such an audience.

   ``I need you to save a place,'' Carol Gill, a private adviser in
Westchester County, N.Y., said as she approached Fitzsimmons of
Harvard, with all the gravity of a lawyer pleading before the
Supreme Court.

<P>
   ``It's for my granddaughter,'' Ms. Gill explained. ``She's just
8, but she's a champion swimmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzsimmons, who's heard countless variations of this pitch
since joining Harvard's admissions office in 1972, laughed before
suggesting that Ms. Gill check back in 10 years, when the child
would be a high school senior, to make sure he was ``still
around.''

GIULIANI URGES RELEASE OF ISRAELI SPY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani urged President
Clinton Tuesday to free convicted Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard, a
move that could bolster Jewish support for the New York
Republican's prospective Senate campaign _ and complicate efforts
by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Pollard deserves presidential clemency because the
life sentence for espionage given him in 1987 goes ``way beyond''
sentences given in the past to American citizens convicted of
spying for a U.S. ally.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard, a former civilian U.S. Navy intelligence analyst, has
already served a longer prison term than enemy spies who are
routinely traded by their governments, according to Giuliani, a
former federal prosecutor and associate attorney general in the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that there was an appropriate basis on which
the president could exercise his discretion and cut that particular
sentence,'' Giuliani said, adding that Pollard has ``served much
more than anyone else convicted of the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York mayor, campaigning in the nation's capital in
conjunction with his possible U.S. Senate bid, said he was
restating a position that he had taken on the Pollard case ``a
couple of years ago'' rather than announcing a new position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't reviewed it again since then but I have no reason to
change my mind about it,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration continues to review clemency for
Pollard in the aftermath of repeated requests by the Israeli
government.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who is weighing a Senate bid from New York, told
reporters earlier this month that she would await the outcome of
the White House review before announcing her view of clemency for
Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that is an issue of great concern to a number of
people,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``They have been expressing their
concern to me, including members of the intelligence and national
security community. There is a review under way at the highest
levels of national government, and I'm going to wait until I see
what that review says.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollard, who was awarded Israeli citizenship by the government
of Israel while in prison, pleaded guilty to espionage charges in
1987 for spying for Israel in the mid-1980s. Prosecutors said
Pollard sold more than 1,000 classified documents, including
satellite photographs, to Israel. Pollard admitted accepting more
than $45,000 in cash from the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
   After denying for years that Pollard had spied, Israel admitted
on May 11, 1998, for the first time that Pollard had ``acted as an
Israeli agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollard has been eligible for parole since 1995. But the
opposition of U.S. intelligence officials, including CIA Director
George Tenet, has impeded his release.
</P>
<P>
   The president rejected an appeal for clemency in 1994, saying
that the ``enormity of Mr. Pollard's crime, the harm his actions
caused to our country and the need to deter every person who might
even consider such actions warrant his continued incarceration.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Jewish organizations, including the New York-based Union of
Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, have called on the
president to release Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish voters make up a powerful political constituency in New
York politics, accounting for 12 percent of the statewide vote in
the 1998 U.S. Senate race and 23 percent of the vote in the New
York City mayor's race in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Then-Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., toppled Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y., last year in part by carrying 76 percent of the Jewish
vote. Giuliani won a second term as mayor of New York City in 1997
by winning 72 percent of the Jewish vote against his Democratic
rival.

<P>
   Giuliani voiced support for clemency for Pollard as he continued
to criticize the Clinton administration for offering presidential
clemency to Puerto Rican nationalists freed from prison earlier
this month after serving long sentences. Their organization, the
FALN, has been linked with terrorist bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton freed the nationalists despite the ``uniform
opposition'' of some federal law enforcement agencies, Giuliani
said.
</P>
<P>
   The president ought to explain his rationale, Giuliani said,
adding: ``I think if the president is going to exercise the option
to give clemency or a pardon, he owes it to the American people to
release the documents on which he decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton invoked executive privilege earlier this month to keep
Congress from obtaining the documents related to his decision.
</P>
<P>
   On other issues, Giuliani:
</P>
<P>
   _ Vowed to ``evict'' the Brooklyn Museum of Art from leased city
property in connection with his criticism of an exhibition that
includes a portrait of the Virgin Mary splattered with elephant
dung.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you desecrate a religious symbol, public money shouldn't
be used to support it,'' Giuliani told a news conference. He vowed
to eliminate the $7 million city subsidy for the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has criticized the ``deeply offensive'' exhibit and
said she would not visit it. However, she said that cutting off $7
million in city funds was a ``very wrong response.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Giuliani said he would oppose moves in Congress to hike the
$5.15 minimum wage by $1 over the next two years because it might
jeopardize entry-level jobs being filled by former welfare
recipients moving into the work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take a look at whether by raising the minimum wage
you aren't putting people out of work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has come out in favor of the increase, saying a
hike would help wage earners and be good for the economy.

<P>
   LIQUICA, East Timor _ Swooping in from above the blinding sea in
six Black Hawk helicopters, the shock troops of a still growing
multinational peacekeeping force moved into this seaside town on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The landing, completed Tuesday, was the opening of a campaign to
extend the force's operation beyond the capital, Dili, and to
subdue armed resistance throughout the territory, officers said.
</P>
<P>
   The 107 Australian soldiers, along with four armored vehicles
that drove up the winding coastal road from Dili, found a sunny
whitewashed town, filled with bird song and bright with
bougainvillea but almost entirely empty of people.
</P>
<P>
   Not a rooster crowed; not a stray dog wandered the streets.
Charred and loosened sheets of tin roofing banged in the soft sea
breeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard to imagine people could do this,'' said one soldier as he
carried his 100 pounds of equipment and weaponry through the town,
stopping warily at crossroads to confirm that nobody was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature of the beast,'' a second soldier replied.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Liquica, 20 miles east of Dili, the armed militia
members who had been on a killing spree in the region at the
beginning of this month fled just over a week after the force
arrived in East Timor, well before the peacekeepers' operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have secured Dili and now we are moving to go out, town to
town, to stabilize the situation so that the people can come down
from the hills and try to resume their lives,'' said an officer
here.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Liquica, the militias burned or vandalized
virtually every building. They forced the population to flee into
the mountains or to board ships, in what seems to have been an
effort to disperse much of the territory's population.
</P>
<P>
   In a signal that East Timor remains a dangerous and ugly place,
the Roman Catholic Bishop Basilio Do Nascimento confirmed Tuesday
the ambush killings on Saturday of nine people, including two nuns,
two church deacons and a seminarian. For weeks, armed men have made
priests and church workers their targets for death.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Liquica, each aircraft touched down for no more than 45
seconds here on Monday, as soldiers then ran into ruined buildings,
smashing the already broken glass from windows to take up defensive
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running movement left side,'' came a voice over the radio as
the mission's commander, Maj. Terry Dewhurst, crouched on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   And from a hovering observation helicopter, ``Two locals with
long bladed weapons moving west.''
</P>
<P>
   The major sent units in pursuit _ ``I want that man in the red
shirt'' _ but none turned out to be militia members.
</P>
<P>
   Then 11 young men appeared, dirty and wearing rubber sandals,
each holding high, in both hands, leaflets that had been scattered
in the past three days from aircraft belonging to the peacekeeping
force, known as Interfet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't shoot at Interfet helicopters or personnel,'' read one
multilingual leaflet. ``Interfet is here to help the people of East
Timor.''
</P>
<P>
   For the many people here who cannot read, the leaflets were
illustrated by bold depictions of helicopters and automatic rifles.
</P>
<P>
   The leaflets appeared to have been the advance wave of the
mission, giving a warning that cleared the militias from the city
and insuring a clean, swift, operation before the soldiers withdrew
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't leave any permanent personnel behind this time, but
sooner or later we will start positioning platoons in these
areas,'' Dewhurst said. With the peacekeeping force scheduled to
grow to no more than 8,000 troops in this territory of 800,000
people, officers in East Timor agree that there will be far too few
soldiers for a permanent security presence in every town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only come to an area for so long,'' said the major.
``We'll just keep playing leap frog until we're lucky enough to
land in a town where these guys are and give them a bloody day.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11 young men were searched, and when they were found to be
unarmed, sent off down the road toward the mountains, still holding
high their leaflets.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Later, the soldiers stopped a man with a sword and one with a
dagger, both in wooden sheaths. The men were disarmed, placed on
their knees, handcuffed, searched, questioned and, finally,
released after they had satisfied the soldiers that they were not
militia members.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Liquica is one of the prettiest and one of the most murderous
towns in East Timor, a former Portuguese territory where as many as
200,000 people have died since Indonesian troops invaded in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   For years, there were unconfirmed reports of massacres as the
Indonesians tried to use sheer brutality to pacify separatist
guerrillas. Early this year, the Indonesian government offered to
let the people in East Timor vote on independence.
</P>
<P>
   The military then created, armed and in many cases led the
militias in a new campaign of brutality.
</P>
<P>
   In early April, they carried out one of their worst massacres,
at the church here in Liquica. A local human rights group, Yayasan
Hak, estimated that as many as 60 people were shot dead.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, when the Indonesians bowed to international
pressure to let journalists visit the scene, the church had been
newly painted and scrubbed to remove evidence of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the church was locked and empty. But this time,
emboldened by the presence of the Australian soldiers, residents
came forward to tell their stories.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday morning, after camping on the grounds of the
vandalized mansion of the local governor, the troops awoke to find
hundreds of residents walking down from their refuge in the
mountains above the town.
</P>
<P>
   With the militia gone for the moment at least, they were coming
to scavenge for food and belongings to take back to the mountains,
in the same way refugees have been coming into Dili and leaving
again for the past several days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The militia said they will come back and attack us again,''
said Jose Vidigal, 17. ``We will go back to the mountains today. We
are still afraid.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The soldiers set up checkpoints to pat down the villagers for
weapons. Smiling shyly, the villagers lifted their shirt fronts for
the search, then marched from soldier to soldier to shake their
hands.
</P>
<P>
   With an embarrassed smile, a boy handed over a rubber band
slingshot; smiling back, a soldier returned it to him.
</P>
<P>
   The stories they told appeared to be the stories of most of the
people of East Timor. Thousands of residents had been herded to the
beach, they said, where they camped for up to two weeks. From
there, members of the militia forced them onto ferries heading
mostly to West Timor, a part of Indonesia, where as many as 200,000
refugees now live in camps.
</P>
<P>
   Many other residents, like Jacinto Maria Lobo, 44, fled into the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said, she was heading for the port where she had left
her belongings before slipping away with her family late one night.
But like many people, she found almost nothing to salvage.
</P>
<P>
   One man, eating a raw green mango, carried a handful of plastic
hangers. With him walked a man with an unopened can of paint.
</P>
<P>
   In a small girl's straw basket were several old rubber sandals,
several empty plastic bottles and a broken comb. An old woman had a
tin of rusty nails.
</P>
<P>
   One lucky man carried a stack of plastic chairs on one shoulder
and a live chicken hanging from his belt.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving town Tuesday, the troops distributed rice to
about 150 villagers gathered in the scorching noonday heat of a
soccer field.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people waiting patiently for food was Leonilde
Pereira, 11, who had salvaged from her home a book of religious
pictures, a book of Disneyland needlepoint patterns and a feather
duster.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Suzi Paula Pereira, had rescued only a Christmas
card.

   WASHINGTON _ New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani urged President

move that could bolster Jewish support for the New York
Republican's prospective Senate campaign _ and complicate efforts

 &HT;    Looking for a clone: Steven Stice
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Steven Stice, a cloning expert, feels his new job
as scholar and entrepreneur at the University of Georgia would be
hard to duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   At age 37, Stice is one of the youngest in the state's stable of
32 Eminent Scholars, a special faculty of scientists and
technologists co-sponsored by the research universities and the
Georgia Research Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   An Illinois native and man of many interests, Stice came to
Athens this year from the University of Massachusetts, where he
pioneered in gene splicing. What lured him to Georgia, however, was
a chance at a bigger objective: to market as quickly as possible
the innovations he and his associates discover in the laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   But when you talk to him, it seems what pleases him most right
now is his family's easy adaptation to life in the Peach State. It
has been a soft landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have moved several times, my wife, the children, and I,''
said Stice, ``but this one has been the easiest. What helps my work
most is to have a good family life, and so this has been very
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Stice's family includes 11-year-old fraternal twins, a boy and
girl, as well as a 13-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps my son has made the only sacrifice _ he has had to
give up ice hockey, but he has taken to roller versions.''
</P>
<P>
   His daughter Claire, who loves animals, now has her own horse,
thanks to the spacious property the family occupies. ``It was one
of the bribes that got them to move,'' Stice said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to his delight, Stice's new digs place him just steps
away from his friend and colleague Professor Clifton A. Baile,
another Eminent Scholar and Georgia specialist in biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I taught Steve nearly everything he knows,'' says Baile,
tongue planted firmly in cheek. Baile is credited with helping
persuade Stice to relocate.
</P>
<P>
   The jocular relationship underlines a central fact: That the new
environment could make Stice and his team even more productive
because of the facility and the relationships the scholar has with
academic and commercial colleagues bent on exploring the genetic
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The new animal science building, where Baile and Stice spend
their time, may be underwhelming architecturally, but it is
resplendent with the latest equipment. It includes computer-driven
machines for peering into animal cells, as well as labs that look
like medical operating rooms, which they are, for the implantation
of engineered embryos into sheep and cattle.
</P>
<P>
   The new equipment has been made possible by grants from the
Georgia Research Alliance, a partner with the universities and
research centers in attracting the Eminent Scholars to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   In the same building on Georgia's South Campus are four young
businesses, each depending on the latest discoveries from the
geneticists among Stice and his colleagues. Close at hand, they can
easily collaborate with the scholars in much the same way the
pioneers of Silicon Valley collaborated with Stanford University
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Stice's own company, Prolinia, specializes in cloning for
agricultural purposes, and looks to clone pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Optimistically, the research center includes a lab specially
designed for implanting embryos in pigs, a feat no one has
accomplished so far. Stice says that one of his priorities will be
to break the barriers that block cloning and deeper study of pig
reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why pigs are harder to handle genetically than other
animals, Stice was direct: ``Beats me. Some animals are easy,
others are difficult. Cattle and sheep are easy, pigs are
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   His specialty has a number of critics, including some who
question the wisdom of cloning, arguing that the quest to get super
animals will destroy variety and leave the herds subject to serious
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a valid consideration,'' Stice said. ``But we are
mindful that we need to be careful not to decrease the genetic pool
and instead encourage variety. For instance, developing lines that
do better in the tropics, and others that are best adapted to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cloning only increases the supply of genetically superior
animals here now. We need genetic diversity to make a leap forward,
and so there is a real economic reason to keep diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   How about human cloning, or cloning of beloved family pets?
</P>
<P>
   Stice said the family dog died last year and he ``gave no
thought at all to cloning the animal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First, I think what we really enjoy in friends and in pets is
individuality, and I don't think we would want uniformity, even if
we could achieve it,'' Stice said.
</P>
<P>
   And on that point, he said cloning is sometimes misunderstood
and overestimated in its power to produce precise desired results.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, two cloned animals might be genetically
identical but they could have very different appearances _ one
solid color, the other spotted. These outward qualities, many of
them environmentally induced, not genetically, are what we often
desire most about animals or pets, and genetics do not produce them
reliably.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though his skills are adaptable to genetic advances that
can increase pharmaceuticals, Stice said that at the moment his
interests lean more toward agricultural improvement. He is very
interested in medical research to advance the treatment of
Parkinson's disease. But lately he has been spending much of his
time talking to farmers in Georgia about his research and their
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of issues,'' he said. ``Animal agriculture
needs more efficiency, and consistency in their products ... It is
within our capability to produce meat that can be more in line with
consumer expectations, such as steak quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the production side, we can arrive at more muscle mass, and
maybe even reduce the time cycle for producing beef and other
meats.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he said, genetic advances can create more
cooperation among producers, processors and others in the
agricultural business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that through cloning genetics we can produce a
consistency that could price out at $250 per steer produced, and
that works out to potential boost of $10 billion in the United
States market alone,'' Stice said.
</P>
<P>
   It's that bang for the buck that has been one of the goals of
the Georgia Research Alliance, said William Todd, alliance
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting Steve Stice here was one of the triumphs of our
collaborative approach to the recruiting,'' Todd said, ``and the
alliance has been pleased to provide flexibility and extra funding
that have made the project possible.''
</P>
<P>
   An overall sense of collaboration among the schools has been
another goal of the alliance and the legislative supporters of the
Eminent Scholar program.
</P>
<P>
   At least one active project at Georgia could take steps in that
direction. Stice and his colleagues are working on a project
described as DNA on a chip _ an attempt to load genetic factors
onto chips and analyze them with powerful computer programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Done the old way, we would often analyze six, eight, 10 genes
or so,'' Stice said, ``but this new technology will help us look at
10,000 to 40,000 genes at once.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Georgia State and Georgia Tech are cooperating in the
advance of the ``infomatics,'' or data analysis systems, that can
make this gene research work.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Stice is getting involved in the Georgia scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have four season tickets to the football games,'' he said,
``the first time we have had a chance to be a part of a big
football program. We used to win at Illinois and at UMass, but the
scene was nothing like this ...''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We asked for, and got, no special favors _ our seats
are in an end zone, and let's say we have a rooting interest in the
opposition missing kicks wide-right so we can catch a ball!''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, in fact, may have split the uprights with a perfect
kick in recruiting Stice.

 &HT;    Max Mara takes a shine to glitz
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN _ Max Mara showed how to maximize the use of beads and
sequins during its spring/summer 2000 runway preview Tuesday
morning. Though known best to Atlanta women who shop the label's
Lenox Square store as a source for clothes with minimal
embellishment, Max Mara's going in an entirely different direction
with its eveningwear.
</P>
<P>
   The dressier looks were the strongest segment in the collection.
The reason: No one else, so far, has attempted to re-energize a
pattern as pedestrian as plaid by rendering it in bead. Max Mara's
sleeveless jumpsuits were jazzed up with red, black and blue bugle
beads arranged in a grid pattern. Beaded plaid halter tops were
paired with cranberry satin skirts or boot-cut pants. Satin blouses
topped knee-length, beaded plaid skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Solid-colored clothes made up the bulk of the collection
however. Navy blue blouses and belted polo shirts served as the
underpinning for an assortment of waxed cotton coatdresses, suits
and jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   There were lots of shorts hemmed at mid-thigh that weren't
especially attractive on the models' pale legs.
</P>
<P>
   And Max Mara's long, belted dresses with matching scarves that
garroted the models' slender necks didn't look quite right either.
There were so many outfits to choose from, however, that a few duds
could be forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   Emporio Armani
</P>
<P>
   Ever looked through a kaleidoscope and marveled at the colors,
shapes and patterns? Well, Giorgio Armani had similar visuals in
mind while designing his lower-priced Emporio collection for spring
and summer. He said before the show that Emporio was all about
empowering women with wardrobing options. Afterward, some
detractors said there were far too many _ in terms of color, cut
and fabrication _ for the average woman to make sense of. Will
women go for Emporio's short skirts or knee-length tunics over
long, slim-fitting pants? And will they dare wear the micro-tank
tops that offer less coverage than brassieres, or the see-through
pants with just enough sequins in just the right places? The
Emporio collection's color scheme (varying shades of blue, green
and red) was invigorating and the clothes had a fierce femininity
to them. But critics noted that Armani should remember: No one
understands a kaleidoscope's intricacies as well as he who
assembled it.

   POSTCARD FROM MILAN
</P>
<P>
   Legs bared, women take the wheel
</P>
<P>
   By A. Scott Walton
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Her skirt was hiked up and her chestnut hair blew wildly in the
wind as she made her way down the Piazza Republica Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   When, I wondered, did Milanese women stop being ridden around on
motor scooters by their male companions? When did so many become
drivers?
</P>
<P>
   The city's cobblestone streets have always seemed as clogged
with scooters as compact cars. But never have so many been manned
by women (and it must be a lucrative market: One dealership's
infomercial, which airs daily, targets women exclusively.)
</P>
<P>
   Modesty doesn't prevent these motor mamas from riding in short
skirts, and their scooters seem newer, cleaner and more stylish
than the men's. Fashionably, but foolishly, fewer women seem to be
wearing helmets.
</P>
<P>
   Watching one riding sidesaddle behind her male driver Monday
made me consider that kind of motoring trust. Gives the phrase
``holding on to your man for dear life'' deeper meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the fairer sex has a firm hold on the handlebars.
</P>
<P>
   Can the days when these macho men of Milan start riding with
their arms wrapped around women's torsos be far behind?
</P>

 &HT;    E-campus courses offer credits, flexibility
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Brandy McCorkle had a problem. She needed one more
course to graduate, but the course she needed on the Mississippi
State campus conflicted with her job. She was stymied.
</P>
<P>
   Stacia Washer, a full-time hospital worker in Quality, Ken., and
a busy mother, desperately needed to find time to study toward a
degree _ but how to physically fit it in an already demanding
schedule?
</P>
<P>
   Both of these women found refuge in one of the newest and
fastest growing sources of higher education, the Electronic Campus.
It is a fast-growing so-called distance learning program, where
students in 16 states take college courses by way of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Electronic Campus, not to be confused with the new Georgia
GLOBE program, started just two years ago with 104 courses has now
mushroomed into one of the biggest ``campuses'' in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, The Electronic Campus comprised more than 2,000
courses, with more than 20,000 students enrolled, many of them in
their choice of 65 degree programs. All level of degrees are
offered and the Electronic Campus is now connected to the Georgia
Galileo library system, providing vast new sources of reference
readings to the students on the far-flung campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about this program is that we are not a flea
market, we are a mall, an educational mall,'' said Mark Musick,
president of the Southern Regional Education Board, which started
and now governs the Electronic Campus.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception as an idea back in 1996, the web- based
campus has always been governed by the participating colleges who
offer the courses, and coordinated by the SREB.
</P>
<P>
   The colleges maintain records of the enrolled students, keep
track of their progress and decide what credits are given for the
work.
</P>
<P>
   The SREB acts as the switchboard for the courses, and as dean
assuring that the courses are of the right caliber. The board,
through Music and his team, puts together the support services like
the Galileo addition.
</P>
<P>
   And so McCorkle got Mississippi State credit for her course, and
Washer can work through Western Kentucky, the school she would
attend if she had the time to do so.
</P>
<P>
   As with everything on the Internet, its glory is the always on
connection , giving students and schools a new flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Musick said Georgia's Clayton College and State University and
Southern Polytechnic have been among the busiest and most creative
partners in the Electronic Campus. Clayton's former president,
Richard Skinner, was named this year to organize a new program of
electronic education to bolster Georgians' opportunity to benefit
from distance learning.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the state's program, GLOBE or Global Learning
On-line for Business and Education, is to get more Georgians to
study college courses and to strengthen the state's pool of workers
in information technology and other skills for business growth.
</P>
<P>
   The Electronic Campus has no such focus but instead stretches
broadly to provide a range of courses, emphasizing regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered how the colleges, normally so competitive, agreed to
such a cooperative program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governors of the 16 states decided three years ago that we
needed this 'educational free trade zone' to suit students needs
and strengthen the system for the region,'' Musick said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that though schools are competitive, on the
higher levels and in research endeavors, cooperation has always
been a hallmark of secondary education. This has led to a kind of
educational ``Common Market'' approach to electronic or distance
learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly a sense of cooperation as we build this
program,'' said Bruce N. Chaloux, director of the Electronic
Campus.
</P>
<P>
   The range of offerings is large, from simple courses with
reading lists and study guides to others that are interactive web
sites, with give and take between teachers and even among students.
</P>
<P>
   The Electronic Campus can be viewed at the following site:
www.sreb.org.
</P>
<P>
   Some futurists have predicted that the growth of distance
learning could spell the end of higher education as we know it, and
provide an escape from the rigidity and expense of old-fashioned
education using bricks and mortar.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Chaloux sees it another way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Youngsters will still go to college,'' he said, ``but the ways
they learn will change and there will be newer options and
approaches that will enhance their learning opportunities.''

   NY-JAZZ-MUSICIANS (New York) _ In the last few years, the New
York downtown music scene has undergone a startling mutation,
albeit one not immediately audible to the innocent ear. Clubs like
the Knitting Factory and Tonic stillfeature many of the usual
musicians, some of them now approaching 50. The music has largely
retained its brash, collage-driven spirit. But beneath the
appearance of continuity, a paradigm shift has emerged. Once known
for their rootless cosmopolitanism, downtown musicians are now
passionately searching for roots _ not necessarily their own. By
Adam Shatz.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LIMEY-FILMS (London) _ At the age of 60, white-haired and
soft-spoken, Terence Stamp has evidently come to terms with that
other Terence Stamp who became an overnight star in Peter Ustinov's
1962 movie version of ``Billy Budd,'' that high-living younger self
who was a fixture in English tabloids as an icon of the Swinging
'60s. But he still can't help wondering why, when the 1970s
arrived, he vanished from the screen. Now, in Steven Soderbergh's
new movie, ``The Limey,'' which opens in New York on Friday, the
young and the old Terence Stamps have been brought together in a
novel way. ``The Limey,'' which is slang for a Briton, has Stamp
playing Dave Wilson, a tough Cockney ex-con who travels to Los
Angeles to avenge what he believes is the covered-up murder of his
daughter, Jennifer. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   BOYS-DON'T-CRY-FILM (Undated) _ Most actresses know that their
careers are largely dependent on their looks. But last year, Hilary
Swank had to worry about her appearance both as actress and actor.
``Its absolutely amazing what happens when a woman chops her hair
off,'' said Ms. Swank, who cut hers to play a woman passing as a
young man in the film ``Boys Don't Cry.'' The movie, opening on
Friday, tells the tale of Teena Brandon, a young woman from
Nebraska who abandoned her identty to embark on a new life as
Branda Teena. A true story that ended in 1993 when she was murdered
by two male friends enraged by the deception. By Ted Loos. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   ALEXANDER-NEVSKY-VIDEO (Undated) _ ``Sergei, you are a true
Bolshevik,'' Joseph Stalin is said to have exclaimed to Sergei
Eisenstein, clapping him on the back, after viewing ``Alexander
Nevsky.'' In the late 1930s one appreciated that kind of reaction
from Stalin, and it certainly was opportune for a director whose
prior lack of enthusiasm for the state and the Communist revolution
had stalled his career for almost 10 years. With ``Alexander
Nevsky,'' his first film with sound, Eisenstein climbed back into
official favor. By Peter M. Nichols.

   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DAME-EDNA-THEATER (New York) _ In previews at the Booth Theater,
where it opens on Oct. 17, ``Dame Edna'': The Royal Tour,'' is the
Broadway debut of a cross-dressing character whose ``natural
wisteria'' hair color, and penchant for gladioli and calling her
audience possums are more famous in Britain and her homeland of
Australia than the drag queen Ru Paul is here. Although less
well-known in America than in any other English-speaking part of
the world, Dame Edna Everage has had no trouble so far drawing a
celebrated audience. By Frank DeCaro.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MUSICALS-DANCING (Undated) _ In the last couple of seasons, the
musical theater, both in New York (``Fosse,'' ``Footloose'') and in
London (``Oklahoma!,'' ``Swan Lake'') seems to have rediscovered
dancing _ not as an ornament or a practical interlude to entertain
the audience while the actors or singers change costume, but as a
resource in itself that can help advance the themes or story of a
show, or, in the cases of ``Fosse'' and ``Swan Lake,'' embody them
fully. By Mindy Aloff. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   LIMON-DANCE (New York) _ As a dance student at the Juilliard
School in the 1960s, Carla Maxwell studied with both Jose Limon and
Antony Tudor, two of the century's seminal choreographers. Aside
from their Juilliard connection, the two _ the first a pillar of
midcentury American modern dance, the other a master of subtle,
psychologically astute classical ballets _ were not likely to find
their paths crossing. But they will now. Works by these
choreographers will share a program when the Limon Dance Company,
of which Ms. Maxwell is the artistic director, comes to the Joyce
Theater starting Tuesday for a two-week season. The troupe will
perform Tudor's 1937 masterwork ``Dark Elegies'' alongside Limon's
``There Is a Time,'' from 1956. By Susan Reiter.

<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   KERNIS-MUSIC-AWARD (Undated) _ The track record of some of the
Pulitzer Prize awards for music in recent years seems destined to
guarantee even greater bafflement for future auditors. Even now,
who can fail to be stumped by the 1990 prize awarded to Mel
Powell's ``Duplicates: A Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra''
over John Corigliano's greatly esteemed (and widely performed)
Symphony No. 1? Notwithstanding the occasional inscrutable
decisions, few could disagree with the 1998 Pulitzer Prize awarded
to Aaron Jay Kernis for his String Quartet No. 2 ``musica
instrumentalis''. As performed by the Lark Quartet on a recent
Arabesque disc (Z6727) coupling the award-winning work with its
predecessor, Kernis's String Quartet No. 2 is revealed as one of
the finest American string quartets written in the last two
decades, and, perhaps, much longer than that. By Lawrence A.
Johnson.

<P>
   JAMMESES-PHOTOGS (Paris) _ After a series of gifts and sales of
their treasures to the Bibliotheque Nationale and the Musee d'Orsay
in Paris as well as to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Santa Monica,
Calif. (now in Los Angeles), and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
New York, Andre Jammes and his wife, Marie-Therese have sent to
auction much of what is left of their ``magnificent obsession,''
said Philippe Garner, the director of the photography department at
Sotheby's in London. Thirty of the most important photographs and
albums are on exhibit through Tuesday at Sotheby's in New York. The
sale of the collection, 2,000 images in 280 lots, will take place
on Oct. 27 in London. By Rita Reif.
</P>
<P>
   MORIYAMA-PHOTOGS (Undated) _ One of the pleasures of the
relatively young field of photographic history is that discoveries
are still possible and neglected areas can be filled in. Right now
New York is playing host to three shows of the photography of Daido
Moriyama, born in 1938 and one of Japan's most respected and
influential contemporary photographers. By Vicki Goldberg.

   TV-ARISTOCRATS (Undated) _ The ``Mobil Masterpiece Theater''
version of ``Aristocrats'' is (a three-part production beginning
next Sunday night on PBS). An era of powdered wigs, corsets,
bustles and towering plumed headdresses may seem an unlikely place
to discover strong, intelligent women taking charge of their lives,
but the second half of the 18th century was a time of great social
change in Britain. By Anita Gates.

 &HT;    McCain takes campaign to South, chides Clinton, Congress
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ With one of the aircraft carriers his
grandfather commanded in World War II as a backdrop, Republican
presidential candidate John McCain Tuesday lambasted the president
and Congress for neglecting the nation's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that President Clinton has failed his first
responsibility to the nation by weakening our defenses. But he's
not the only one to blame,'' the Arizona senator said, standing in
front of the USS Yorktown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both parties in Congress have wasted scarce defense dollars on
unneeded weapons systems and other pork projects while 12,000
enlisted personnel, proud young men and women, subsist on food
stamps.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also blasted the Clinton administration for a ``feckless,
photo-op foreign policy'' which he said has left the nation's
military overcommitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States of America needs an experienced person to
steer the ship of state through dangerous waters,'' McCain said at
a breakfast stop in Greenville, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also wed campaign finance reform, an issue he's
identified with, to an idea popular among Republicans _ school
vouchers. He proposed taking $5.4 billion in sugar, oil and gas
subsidies to pay for a voucher program in the nation's poorest
schools. McCain contends the subsidies exists because of the money
business pours into the political system.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was on the second day of a campaign kick-off tour that
began in New Hampshire and will take him to Michigan and the West
Coast. He announced for president in April, but delayed the tour
due to the war in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The former Vietnam War POW has focused on South Carolina, which
has the highest number of veterans per capita of any state in the
nation and votes first among the Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, our campaign will rise and fall on how we do here in
the great state of South Carolina,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Answering questions from voters, McCain also said the U.S.
sooner or later will be forced to ``face down'' North Korea. And he
again criticized rival Pat Buchanan for contending in his recent
book that U.S. involvement in World War II could have been avoided,
a theory which McCain said denigrates the sacrifice Americans made
in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt about Jane Fonda, McCain said he has ``tried
to put the war behind me,'' but he still thinks Fonda's actions on
a visit to North Vietnam while he and other American servicemen
were imprisoned was ``beyond any boundaries of behavior that any
decent American would engage in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate also spent part of the day on the
Internet, answering questions from students around the country as
part of the Kids Voting USA project.

 &HT;    WebMd, Healtheon merger might miss deadline
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ WebMD and California-based Healtheon apparently will
not meet their original goal of bringing off their much-touted
merger in September.
</P>
<P>
   As the month draws to a close, the ambitious Internet companies
are gradually negotiating their way through the thicket of
regulatory oversight, while still expecting final approval soon
from the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   William Michalak, analyst at Wachovia Securities, said the delay
is of little concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace for any of these Web-related companies is
moving very rapidly,'' he said. ``It's going to take a little more
time to put all the pieces together.''
</P>
<P>
   WebMD and Healtheon announced a ``merger of equals'' on May 20
with plans to dominate the use of the Internet for healthcare
information. WebMD, had just called off its public offering, and
remains privately-held. On the day the merger was announced,
Healtheon stock was selling for $100 a share and the stock
combination was valued at nearly $6 billion. A day later, Healtheon
stock crested at $105 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Despite several spikes northward, Healtheon stock has mostly
taken a slow slide, closing at $36.25 a share Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the sagging stock price cannot be blamed on any doubts about
the companies or the merger, Michalak said. ``This is just an ugly
stock market. The Web companies tend to be treated as rudely as
any.''
</P>
<P>
   In the merger of another Atlanta-based symbol of the new
economy, MindSpring Enterprises last week also announced plans for
a corporate marriage with a California competitor. The deal calls
for the new company to be based in Atlanta _ just as Healtheon and
WebMD have said their headquarters will be here.
</P>
<P>
   But MindSpring's merger with EarthLink will mean surrendering
its name to the Pasadena company. In contrast, WebMD and Healtheon
announced plans for the combined companies to be combined in name
as well: Healtheon WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   Should the SEC's permission arrive as expected in early October,
the companies would likely be given a closing date in November.
</P>
<P>
   Announced plans call for WebMD's 29-year-old founder and chief
executive to be CEO of the combined company. W. Michael Long, the
CEO of Healtheon, will be chairman and chief operating officer.
James Clark, founder of Netscape and chairman of Healtheon, will be
a member of the board of directors for Healtheon WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the rest of the board, nor the rest of the management
team has been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the two companies have a 1,800-person workforce,
including about 200 at WebMD. But each side of the equation is
expected to focus on its strengths. Healtheon is expected
post-merger to handle technology issues while WebMD will take the
lead on marketing and deal-making.
</P>
<P>
   And WebMD has done a ton of deal-making in the year since it
announced a $10 million investment from HBO&AMP;Co. In In February,
WebMD signed a multimillion-dollar deal with CNN in which the
company would advertise on CNN, while CNN would promote WebMD on
the air.
</P>
<P>
   In March, WebMD agreed to pay $52.5 million to become the
exclusive healthcare provider on the Internet network Lycos.com. In
April, DuPont announced a $220 million investment in WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   The Healtheon closing will actually involve a four-way deal.
Healtheon has announced agreements to purchase Mede America and
merge with WebMD, which itself agreed to buy Greenberg News
Networks and its Medcast subsidiary. All those deals are to close
simultaneously.

   &UR; POOF! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A magician was working on a cruise ship in the Caribbean. The
audience would be different each week, so the magician allowed
himself to do the same tricks over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one problem: The captain's parrot saw the shows
every week and began to understand what the magician did in every
trick.
</P>
<P>
   Once he understood that, he started shouting in the middle of
the show:
</P>
<P>
   `Look, it's not the same hat!`
</P>
<P>
   `Look, he's hiding the flowers under the table!`
</P>
<P>
   `Hey, why are all the cards the Ace of Spades ?`
</P>
<P>
   The magician was furious but couldn't do anything, it was the
captain's parrot after all.
</P>
<P>
   One day the ship had an accident and sunk. The magician found
himself on a piece of wood, in the middle of the ocean, and of
course the parrot was by his side. They stared at each other with
hate, but did not utter a word.
</P>
<P>
   This went on for several days. After a week the parrot finally
said:
</P>
<P>
   `Okay, I give up. What'd you do with the boat ?`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEEE-FENSE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor: Did you kill the victim?
</P>
<P>
   Defendant: No, I did not.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor: Do you know what the penalties are for perjury?
</P>
<P>
   Defendant: Yes, I do. And they're a heck of a lot better than
the penalty for murder!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THESE KIDS TODAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A kid calls up his mum from his college and asks her for some
money, because he ran out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Mum says, `Sure, sweetie. Mum will send you some money. `You
also left your calculus book here when you visited 2 weeks ago. Do
you want me to send that up too?`
</P>
<P>
   `Uhh, oh yeah, o.k.` Responds the kid.
</P>
<P>
   So Mum wraps the book up along with the checks up in a package,
kisses Dad goodbye, and goes to the post office to mail the money
and the book.
</P>
<P>
   When she gets back, Dad asks, `Well how much did you give the
boy this time?
</P>
<P>
   Mum says, `Oh, I wrote 2 checks, one for $20, and the other for
$1000. out to him'
</P>
<P>
   `That's $1,020!!!` yells Dad, `Are you crazy???`
</P>
<P>
   `Don't worry hun,' Mum says, kissing Dad on the on top of his
bald head, `I taped the $20 check to the cover of his book, but I
put the $1000 one somewhere between the pages in chapter 19!'
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WORKPLACE HUMOR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Smith goes to see his supervisor in the front office. `Boss,' he
says, `we're doing some heavy house-cleaning at home tomorrow, and
my wife needs me to help with the attic and the garage, moving and
hauling stuff.`
</P>
<P>
   `We're short-handed, Smith'` the boss replies. `I can't give you
the day off.`
</P>
<P>
   `Thanks, boss,' says Smith `I knew I could count on you!'
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MORE WORKPLACE HUMOR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The real estate boss got a hot new secretary, and he decided to
put some moves on her, with some success. But within a few weeks,
he is feeling displeased at the way she is working: not caring,
coming to work late, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he pulls her aside, and has a little talk with her.
`Listen, baby, we may have gone to bed together a few times, but
who said you could start coming in late and slacking off?'
</P>
<P>
   The secretary's reply, `My lawyer.`

   CHICAGO _ An opera is built like a puzzle; separate pieces are
carved and fitted together. The music for ``A View From the
Bridge,'' an adaptation of Arthur Miller's play that will have its
premiere at Lyric Opera of Chicago on Oct. 9, was written in Ann
Arbor, Mich., by William Bolcom. The libretto was written by a New
Yorker, Arnold Weinstein; the set was designed by Santo Loquasto in
New York and built in San Diego. The singers have been rehearsing
for weeks now on a partially assembled set in a room on the second
floor of the Civic Opera House here.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, with the singers still upstairs being scrutinized by
the stage director, Frank Galati, the instrumentalists got into the
act, playing the score _ an amalgam of contemporary leaps and
dissonant chords and melodies with the sentimental sweep of show
music _ for the first time in the cavernous empty theater.
</P>
<P>
   The link among the elements is the conductor, Dennis Russell
Davies, who began receiving bits of the score from Bolcom in the
early days of composition, about three years ago. His task is to
know the work more thoroughly than anyone, from details of the
stage drama to the individual parts of the singers and orchestra
players.
</P>
<P>
   The conductor is the composer's chief ally, the guardian of the
integrity of the music against the occasional intrusions of
dramatic demands. But his advocacy is not quite so simple; he is
the director's ally as well, the intermediary between the action on
the stage and the music in the pit. And he is the singers' guiding
light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do my job, prepare the drama, spend all these weeks with the
actors, but you know what?'' Galati said. ``I'm not standing on
that stage. He not only shapes the performance, he performs the
show. He is, more than anyone else, the performer of the opera.''
</P>
<P>
   That is true for any opera, but in a premiere the stakes are
higher because the conductor's role is infused with creativity and
origination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether the composer is dead or alive, you're still his
representative,'' Davies said. ``And it is always true that a
singer who stands on the stage is, in my mind, undertaking a
particularly courageous act.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel a special responsibility to the piece when it's a
premiere because a lot is riding on the first time. You marshal the
forces to do a new opera and it can only be new once. After that,
it has to simply be good. If it's going to be done again, people
have to have confidence in it. And for them to have confidence, I
have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies is the music director of the American Composers Orchestra
as well as chief conductor of the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra
and the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra. In appearance and manner,
however, Davies, 55, doesn't exactly wear the resume of an
internationally known maestro prototypically. He is short and
compact, gap-toothed, wears a prominent earring and keeps his head
more assiduously shaved than his chin. The British-sounding name is
misleading; he is from Toledo, Ohio, and speaks like it, affably
and unaffectedly. He lives mostly in Europe but keeps a place in
New York, and is wont to worry as often over the plight of the
disintegrating Mets as the plight of contemporary opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very cool job,'' he said of his profession, though it
bugs him a bit that the opera conductor is generally undervalued,
unlike a podium-elevated symphony conductor (who orchestra
musicians often grumble gets all the accolades).
</P>
<P>
   ``You've been involved hand in glove with the director, worked
with the composer, you spend weeks with the singers,'' he said.
``And they all appreciate it. But then during the performance,
every moment, you're essential to what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``And the irony is that you can't be seen by the audience
because you're in the pit. At the end, there'll be reviews of the
performance, and somewhere there will be a line that says, `the
orchestra, conducted by blah-blah, played blah-blah-blah.' And that
will be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on his role was that of an editor for Bolcom, offering
suggestions on the composer's drafts and acting as referee in the
modest disagreements that inevitably arise between composer and
singers. The formative period can be a tense time, but it was made
easier because the two men have known each other for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll say to me, `You didn't mean this, you meant that,'''
Bolcom said. ``And he's right.''
</P>
<P>
   When the score was completed, Davies spent several weeks
memorizing it, largely by reading, going to the piano only
occasionally, he said, to work out a particularly knotty chord or
test the emotional impact of a passage.
</P>
<P>
   How well does he know the music? ``You're driving from Chicago
to New York, and you know how to get there,'' he said. ``But you
still take a map.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``View,'' he said, preparing the score was
simplified by his admiration for it and its reflection of the text.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill is a composer at the height of his powers,'' Davies said.
``And the music in this opera is quite pared down, very direct. In
the orchestration, you'll have a melody, a harmonic accompaniment,
sometimes only three or four instruments. It's very, very direct,
and that's risky because it means that it has to be carried on the
quality of the music, its beauty and invention. There are no
compositional pyrotechnics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But of course this fits the play, because Arthur's play is
direct. The story moves quickly; you know what's coming, and it
comes. The composition follows closely the movement of the play.
Bill has put his heart on his sleeve here; the moments when it's
sentimental, it's really sentimental. When it's passionate, it's
really passionate. When it's violent, there are violent sounds.
It's like hearing an illuminating voice.''
</P>
<P>
   The most intense work, however, began in the last couple of
months, when the singers and then the orchestra began to rehearse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a division of territory,'' Davies said. ``Ideally the
conductor and the stage director work hand in hand. In staging
rehearsals, without the orchestra, the director is the boss and I'm
there to support him. When we get back into the theater, with the
orchestra, I'm in charge and he's there to support me.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   His multifarious roles were on display one afternoon last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bolcom was on hand to hear his score, which had existed only in
his mind's ear, brought to life at last. ``It's like the difference
between a beautiful woman and a dirty picture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the front row and watching Davies interpret him, the
composer heard a few mistakes; the computer-printed version of the
score, it turned out, had left out a couple of accidentals. But
Bolcom was beaming. Occasionally, when Davies looked back at him to
acknowledge the resolution of a troublesome moment, their smiles
were giddy.
</P>
<P>
   After Davies dismissed the orchestra, he clapped his hands and
set out to join the singers. ``OK,'' he said, turning to Bolcom.
``Let's see what havoc we can wreak upstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In rehearsals with the singers, Davies generally concentrates on
consistency, conducting with the accompaniment of two pianos,
working on tempos and embedding them in the singers' minds, as he
was doing with the orchestra, so that when they are united (those
rehearsals began Tuesday, ), there will be a minimum of surprises.
That makes performance preparation easier, particularly for the
singers, who have a harder time hearing the musicians, beneath them
in the pit, than the audience does.
</P>
<P>
   ``The orchestra is the horse that everybody rides on,'' Davies
said. ``When you've got a successful performance going, the
orchestra lays the track down and you, as a conductor, can
concentrate on organizing the singers so they can relax. They can't
hear as well as you can, so you have to make sure your gestures are
such that they can read the sound they're hearing. It's almost like
signing.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of a run-through of the second act, which begins
with a barbershop-quartet-like number sung by drunken stevedores,
there was an immediate problem to solve. As written, the
introductory chord for the song, which was to give the singers
their entry pitch, was proving obfuscatory. The pitch notes were
there, but the rest of the chord, complex and dissonant, was hiding
them. Davies persuaded Bolcom to delay the chord, begin with the
pitch notes, allow the singers to enter and then lay on the
complications, completing his chord. Everyone was happy. The
singers had a comfortable entry; Bolcom had the sound he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Davies' strength, said Timothy Nolen, who sings the baritone
role of Alfieri, the neighborhood lawyer in the blue-collar
Brooklyn neighborhood where the play is set and who serves as
narrator, is that he allows the singers their needs.
</P>
<P>
   He added that this flexibility was particularly important for a
new piece because without the handrails of history, everyone is
creating as they go. ``As a conductor, you have to have
elasticity,'' Nolen said. ``In your mind and your arm.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a previous rehearsal Davies solved another problem before
Bolcom even knew it existed. Juliana Rambaldi, the singer playing
Catherine, the play's ingenue, had a line describing her
relationship with her overbearing uncle: ``Now he's mad all the
time.'' The score made a leap in pitch, midline, on the word
``mad,'' and the vowel sound made the high note difficult to
locate. Davies' suggestion was to change the rhythm of the sung
line slightly so the high note landed on ``all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The `aw' was easier to sing than the `ad''' Galati said. ``Who
knew? And, of course, the emphasis on `all' was better for the
sense of the line. I was delighted.''
</P>
<P>
   As the scene was rehearsed and the singers approached the line,
Galati's face registered alarm, and he hustled over to whisper a
warning to Bolcom, though he didn't get there in time.
</P>
<P>
   Bolcom heard the change. His eyebrows raised, then lowered.
Galati looked at Davies, who was looking over his shoulder at the
composer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better,'' Bolcom said. ``Great.''

`THE AUSTIN SESSIONS': KRISTOFFERSON REGAINS GLORY WITH NEW CD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER COOPER   
 Herald-Journal, Spartanburg, S.C.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In so many ways and for so many reasons, this could have been a
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The premise _ an aging ex-star records new versions of the songs
that made him famous _ has been tried many times, nearly always
with poor results.
</P>
<P>
   Decades, money and the accumulated effects of insane amounts of
narcotics tend to dull a singer's passion for his material, even
when the songs themselves remain immediate, timeless and sometimes
brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Kristofferson, now 63, has not lived a life so much as imbibed
one, and the chances of capturing true emotion instead of refried
sentiment on a such a ``Greatest Hits Re-Recorded'' project make
video poker odds seem downright good.
</P>
<P>
   To make things worse, Kristofferson's voice, a froggy, often
off-key croak even in his 1970s prime, hasn't improved a whit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet somehow, throughout what could have been requisite guest
turns by Jackson Browne, Vince Gill, Marc Cohn, Mark Knopfler and
others, producer Fred Mollin captured the old silver-tongued devil
at his best. This is a superb collection of superb songs, with the
newly cut versions bettering Kristofferson's classic originals in
some cases.
</P>
<P>
   The odd thing is that ``The Austin Sessions'' may well be the
first Kristofferson album that many younger listeners and musicians
will ever own. He is known today more as a movie actor than as a
musician, and he's not in all that much demand on the silver
screen, either.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strange situation, considering that Kristofferson wrote
some of the most enduring songs of the century: ``Me and Bobby
McGee,'' ``Sunday Morning Coming Down,'' ``Help Me Make It Through
the Night'' and ``Loving Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do
Again).''
</P>
<P>
   But, with the exception of Janis Joplin's version of ``Me and
Bobby McGee,'' none of those songs has made the transition from
blockbusters of their day to staples of modern radio.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, considering that the Beatles are not even a regular
part of so-called Classic Rock playlists anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation means that most people born after 1970 have
little familiarity with Kristofferson's man's music. That's a
shame, because he remains one of the most intriguing and unlikely
figures in 20th-century musical history.
</P>
<P>
   He was the ultimate outsider in 1970s Nashville, having been
both an Oxford scholar and a professional janitor. But a daring,
unsolicited helicopter landing on now-friend, then-stranger Johnny
Cash's property gave him an audience with the Man in Black, who
recognized profundity when he heard it and ended up recording
``Sunday Morning Coming Down.''
</P>
<P>
   Hits including Ray Price's take on ``For the Good Times'' and
Sammi Smith's gorgeous ``Help Me Make It Through the Night''
followed soon after, and Kristofferson went from cleaning up on his
janitor job to cleaning up on songwriter royalties.
</P>
<P>
   His musical and personal alignment with guitar outlaws Cash,
Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson helped shine the spotlight on the
songwriter, and a marriage to Rita Coolidge gave him both a
talented wife and a pretty voice to offset his sandpaper vocals on
duet albums. More hits followed.
</P>
<P>
   But a fast lifestyle and the decision to move to California to
further his movie career took him away from the musical mainstream
he helped create, and his growing political awareness did not
translate to great songwriting when he attempted to write
eloquently about, for instance, Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Austin Sessions'' returns Kristofferson to the handful
of songs that put him in demand in the first place, and Mollin's
production removes the busy instrumentation that detracted from
some of the originals. This is a leaner, sparer album, at times
sounding like friends playing and singing in a living room rather
than in a soulless studio.
</P>
<P>
   In such a setting, the power of Kristofferson's lyrics moves to
the forefront, and he sings the words like he still means them.
Apparently, he still does: ``I am struck by how alive they (the
songs) are,'' he writes in the liner notes.
</P>
<P>
   The album works as a collection of songs, as a collection of
performances, or as a textbook in songwriting.

`LUCIA' RETURNS, RESTORED AND WITH FEWER FRILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Sir Charles Mackerras conducts Donizetti's
``Lucia di Lammermoor'' at the Metropolitan Opera on Wednesday
night with soprano Andrea Rost in the title role, he expects that
many admirers of this opera may be a bit perplexed by what they
hear. The affable, 73-year-old conductor is performing the opera in
its original 1835 version, which has never been heard before at the
Met, nor, to his knowledge, in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the decades after its premiere, this bel canto favorite was
subjected to cuts, interpolated embellishments and key
transpositions, what Sir Charles calls the ``so-called tradition.''
Many of the changes were introduced by coloratura sopranos singing
Lucia who lowered keys in order to impress audiences with dazzling
high notes and elaborate cadenzas. Conductors sanctioned the
changes, hoping to trim the opera's length and focus the evening on
the heroine, a young Scottish woman with a tenuous grasp on mental
stability who is forced by her family to marry against her will,
forsaking the man she really loves, the scion of the Lammermoor
clan's hated rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The original version restores the cuts, resets Lucia's arias and
duets in their intended keys and eliminates the interpolated high
notes at the ends of arias and the extraneous ornamentation that
long ago became standard practice.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the version of the opera as traditionally done is
``anachronistic, unstylish and generally to be deplored,'' as
Mackerras put it in a recent interview at the Met, does not tend to
bother the average listener, he said. ``They like to hear the top
notes and the fancy cadenzas,'' he added. ``I hope that the other
things we will bring to the opera will be appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   Those other things, he explains, are expressive refinement,
formal elegance and dramatic subtlety, qualities more associated
with the Classical era than the Romanticism of the 1820s and '30s,
when Donizetti was in his prime. Mackerras points out that
Donizetti was born in 1797, the same year as Schubert, and retained
a lifelong sympathy for Classical sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   What differences might ``Lucia'' fans notice?
</P>
<P>
   For one, elaborate ornamental accretions have been replaced with
the more lyrical and less ostentatious embellishments that
Donizetti composed. For example, the long cadenza with flute that
is traditionally performed at the end of the first section of
Lucia's famous ``Mad Scene'' is not by Donizetti, but likely the
invention of coloraturas who performed concert tours with flutists,
said Mackerras. That is gone. Elsewhere in the score, where the
autograph manuscript does not include Donizetti's own ornaments,
Mackerras has sought the suggestions of the conductor and
19th-century opera scholar Will Crutchfield.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition of interpolating full-voiced high notes at the
ends of arias belongs more to Puccini's verismo style than
Donizetti's bel canto practice, Mackerras said. Those have been
omitted for the most part.
</P>
<P>
   Most listeners will probably not notice the restoration of
original keys, but it makes a big difference, Mackerras said. For
example, Lucia's first scene, her pair of arias by the fountain,
were originally in E flat and A flat, respectively. For generations
most sopranos have taken them down a half-step to D and G, then
added high notes and cadenzas. Donizetti's higher keys and gentler
ornaments are adhered to by Mackerras in his version, which Ms.
Rost also performs on a 1998 Sony recording of the opera with
Mackerras conducting the Hanover Band, an early instrument
orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday night, Ms. Rost and the Met cast, which includes
tenor Frank Lopardo and baritone Roberto Frontali, will sing the
original version in five additional performances in October. In
December the production returns for four performances with Ruth Ann
Swenson as Lucia but in the traditional version, conducted by
Edoardo Mueller.
</P>
<P>
   If, as Mackerras said, the traditional ``Lucia'' is ``in general
to be deplored,'' does he think it deserves a continuing place in
the repertory? ``I'm possibly not the person to ask,'' he said.
``The traditional `Lucia' does show how beautifully and brilliantly
a soprano can sing high notes and cadenzas, and artists like Callas
and Sutherland and others more recently have shown how much real
feeling and drama can be extracted from it. But it's a funny
hybrid.''

GOP-LED CONGRESS PUSHES THROUGH STOPGAP SPENDING BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Failing to complete work on Year 2000 spending
measures by the October deadline, Republican leaders were forced to
push a temporary funding bill through Congress Tuesday to avoid a
government shutdown Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to force its legislative priorities on President Clinton,
the House voted 421-2 to continue funding most federal agencies at
current levels at least through Oct. 21 in hopes of reaching some
accommodation by then on remaining spending disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved a similar stopgap measure later Tuesday,
98-1, and Clinton said he will sign it.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said when he assumed his
leadership role in January that Congress had ``an obligation'' to
complete work on all 13 major appropriations bills for fiscal year
2000 by the end of the summer. But with three days to go before the
beginning of the new fiscal year, Congress has finished only five
of those measures. Together, they account for about five percent of
the total federal budget needed for government operations next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Only two bills have been signed by the president and three are
awaiting his signature. Seven are still tied up in negotiations and
awaiting final passage, and one, a giant measure to fund the
Department of Health and Human Services, has yet to be reported out
of the House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Also complicating budget matters is Clinton's threatened veto of
at least six spending measures once they reach his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton delivered on the first of those threats Tuesday
afternoon. He vetoed the appropriations bill that contained $429
million for the District of Columbia because it contains a number
of Republican prohibitions on how the federal money can be spent by
local authorities. Clinton said those prohibitions would interfere
with decisions that should be made by locally elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no way to make a budget,'' declared Rep. John Spratt,
D-S.C., who led the charge by Democrats in blaming the Republicans
for using the spending measures to force their political agenda on
the American people.
</P>
<P>
   He and other Democrats accused GOP leaders of delaying passage
of some measures while they tried to find ways to pay for programs
they want while attempting to cut back on programs favored by the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, said that passage of stopgap spending
measures to keep the government operational is ``a normal and
routine'' part of the budget process, as House Rules Committee
Chairman David Dreier, R-Calif., put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to do our constitutional duty,'' Dreier stressed
during debate on the temporary funding bill. But he added that
other matters, such as adjournments for funerals and disputes with
Democrats over gun control and other controversial issues, had
slowed work on some budget matters.
</P>
<P>
   He and other GOP leaders blamed some of the delay on the
president for not engaging in serious budget talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked (for his input) ... He refused to do so,'' said House
Appropriations Committee Chairman C.W. ``Bill'' Young, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Young said Republicans want to avoid another repeat of the two
disastrous 1995-96 partial government shutdowns in which they tried
and failed to get Clinton to capitulate to their demands. The
public ended up putting most of the blame for those shutdowns on
the GOP leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still sorry we ever did,'' Young said in reference to
the shutdowns. ``But we're trying to avoid that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart challenged
GOP claims that Clinton has not been willing to negotiate
``acceptable areas of compromise'' on spending matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has made it very clear. He wants to work with
them ... We're going to hopefully, in the next three weeks, find
some way around the situations the Republicans have created for
themselves,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   But he stressed that Clinton will not go along with GOP budget
``gimmicks,'' such as declaring routine funding for some programs
as ``emergencies,'' to avoid breaking the 1997 agreement on
spending caps.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., conceded that ``there is nothing new''
about Congress having to pass temporary spending measures, noting
that the procedure has been used by Democratic-controlled
Congresses in years past. But he blamed the delay this year on
Republican attempts to impeach Clinton and to pass their $792
billion tax cut bill, which the president vetoed last week.
</P>
<P>
   Obey said those efforts had wasted time on partisan issues that
Congress could have otherwise spent working out differences over
budget matters.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Texas, also reminded Republicans of their
majority status and their command of the budget and appropriations
committees in both the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in control ... It's not our fault that we haven't
passed the budget by the October deadline,'' Bentsen said during
the debate. ``Perhaps what the American people should learn about
this is it's time to get rid of that control.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bickering over the stopgap measure, Republican
leaders were hopeful that the remaining work on 2000 spending could
be completed in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was poised to vote Tuesday evening on a compromise
$21 billion bill that would fund energy and water projects next
year. The House approved a similar bill Monday night by a vote
327-87.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also planned Tuesday to take up a $324 billion
measure that would cover a broad range of social spending programs,
including everything from education to Medicaid payments. The bill
contains about $500 million more for education programs than
Clinton requested, but would not specifically fund his efforts to
hire another 100,000 new teachers and build more schools.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators also completed work Tuesday on a
compromise $12.6 billion foreign aid measure after they agreed to
drop a section prohibiting aid to organizations that advocate
abortion. The decision was a major defeat for anti-abortion
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill could still face a veto because it contains about
$2 billion less than Clinton requested and has no funding earmarked
for carrying through on the Wye River accords reached earlier this
year between Israel and the Palestinians with U.S. help. The bill
also falls short on funding Clinton requested to help meet U.S.
obligations to the United Nations.

THE DAYS OF RISQUE JOKES AND READING VOLTAIRE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Caroline is clever, Emily is a mother to me, Louisa is an angel
and Cecilia is a child,'' says Sarah Lennox of her rich and
beautiful sisters. Asked to describe herself, she adds, ``I think I
am a disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Stella Tillyard, the author of ``Aristocrats,'' the story of the
Lennox sisters from 1740 to 1832, labels Caroline an intellectual,
Emily a keeper of secrets, Louisa an angel indeed and Sarah as the
most extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Cecilia, the baby, isn't much of a factor in the ``Mobil
Masterpiece Theater'' version of ``Aristocrats'' (a three-part
production beginning next Sunday night on PBS), but an odd,
thwarted kind of feminism is.
</P>
<P>
   An era of powdered wigs, corsets, bustles and towering plumed
headdresses may seem an unlikely place to discover strong,
intelligent women taking charge of their lives, but the second half
of the 18th century was a time of great social change in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a wonderful letter from Emily where as an old lady she
looks back to her youth in the 1740s,'' says Ms. Tillyard, who
based her book largely on the sisters' published letters. ``She
says that in those days women could lie on the couch and tell dirty
jokes; women aren't allowed to do that anymore. Even in her own
lifetime she can chart a constriction on what is possible in female
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tillyard likes to blame the French Revolution. Seeing the
bloody fate of the French aristocracy between 1789 and 1799, the
upper crust in Britain suddenly got very nervous, she explains,
about ``where license led you, where liberalism led you'' and
promptly retreated to conservative social attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tillyard also says that the Lennox sisters, daughters of the
Duke of Richmond (grandson of Charles II and his French mistress),
were unusually smart and well educated even for their class. But
from the first scenes of this BBC America and WGBH Boston
co-production, forthright women seem to be regarded as oddities.
</P>
<P>
   On a pleasant London day in 1743, Caroline (Serena Gordon), the
eldest daughter, reveals that she reads Voltaire and announces with
the sureness of youth: ``Most people do not think. They just agree
with the current fashion.'' Henry Fox (Alun Armstrong), a charming
older man, looks at her admiringly and declares, ``Because you are
young and fair, it does not follow that you are foolish.'' An
admirable sentiment but, if it has to be said, possibly a minority
point of view.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters do turn out to be quite influential, but for most of
their lives the influence comes from their husbands. Caroline
elopes with Fox, a rising Whig politician, but finds that he
devotes much more time and attention to work than to her. When the
Duchess of Richmond (Diane Fletcher) catches her second daughter,
Emily (Geraldine Somerville), reading Voltaire, she discourages it
and tempts her with a sapphire necklace instead.
</P>
<P>
   Emily soon marries Lord Kildare (Ben Daniels), the most powerful
man in Ireland, and has 22 _ yes, 22 _ children, (Some were with
her second husband.) Kildare also cheats on her regularly with the
servant girls.
</P>
<P>
   Louisa (Anne-Marie Duff), who shall henceforth be known as the
boring one, marries the richest man in Ireland (Tom Mullion) and
apparently devotes her life to good works. Then little Sarah (Jodhi
May) grows up and catches the eye of the Prince of Wales (Luke De
Lacy), the future George III.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the temperamental Duke of Richmond (Julian Fellowes)
is practically dancing around the house with joy over his daughter
someday becoming queen, the prince announces his engagement to
someone else. Sarah is talked into marrying a man who bores her
(Andrew Havill) and eventually does the unthinkable: she has
affairs and has the bad luck to become pregnant by a lover. Her
social punishment, supported and enforced by her family, makes the
scarlet letter look lenient.
</P>
<P>
   The Lennox sisters do appear to develop some real social bravery
in later years; one, widowed, marries her children's tutor (George
Anton) and basically forces London society to accept him. And the
women's political beliefs had impact; one of Emily's sons was the
Irish revolutionary Edward Fitzgerald (John Light), who is a major
figure in the show's final episode.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline always speaks her mind, urging her husband not to
profit from war, which she considers ``a disgrace to human
nature.'' But mostly, it seems, the sisters wear beautiful dresses,
walk through beautiful rooms (like those in Carton House outside
Dublin, the Kildares' real home, where some of ``Aristocrats'' was
filmed), bicker over hurt feelings, reunite tearfully and shop.
</P>
<P>
   They also endure a rigid sexual double standard. In their time
``a little gallantry'' (the word being used in the sense of amorous
intrigue) is deemed ``necessary in a man'' but ``unforgivable in a
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Caroline can comment to her husband, with casual acceptance, ``I
know fidelity is not the custom'' for people of their rank and
Emily can observe, at another point, that unfaithfulness in men is
``as common as rain.'' They might have enjoyed the Edwardian
installments of ``Masterpiece Theater'' better. Lady Marjorie could
have taught them a thing or two.

SOCCER PLAYER MAKES POINTS AS ONE OF TEXAS TEAM'S KICKERS

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Amanda Buck of Fort Worth Southwest High
School could hear those trying-too-hard-to-whisper whispers and she
could feel those trying-too-hard-not-to-stare stares.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is she doing with pads on?'' senior center Kennon Weaver
said he remembers thinking. ``Is this a joke?''
</P>
<P>
   She teed the football at the 13-yard line _ the length of an
extra point _ took a few steps back, exhaled, approached and put
her right foot to the ball. She says she wasn't out to prove a
point; she simply wanted to prove to herself that she could make
field goals.
</P>
<P>
   The ball went up, and ... missed. No one laughed or pointed,
they only kept staring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry, you can get this,'' Raiders kicker D.W. McAbee
told her.
</P>
<P>
   Buck repeated the process four more times before she made it.
Buck has played soccer most of her life and had never tried a field
goal before that August practice.
</P>
<P>
   More than a month later, Buck has challenged tradition by
earning a spot on the Raiders varsity football team as one of their
three place-kickers and in the process has become an improbable,
but accepted, member of her team.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents think I'm crazy, but I wanted to prove to myself
that I could do this,'' said Buck, a senior who also plays soccer
and runs track. ``I look around the locker room and it doesn't hit
me I'm the only girl. Not many people have a chance to do this, I
realize that, but I'm a part of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she sometimes feels bad vibes from teammates, but for
the most part everyone is encouraging. Logistically, this isn't a
problem, either; she dresses in the girl's locker room and the only
time the football locker room is closed is when the boys are
dressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we go to games, people can't believe we have a girl on
our team, but I think it's cool,'' senior Jason Strong said. ``I
don't treat her any differently than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   First-year coach Larry Stovall said: ``I never asked her why she
wanted to do this, but I think she's enjoying it. In 27 years of
coaching, I've had three girls say they were going to come out to
play football and none ever did. I knew Amanda would because she is
capable of this.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, she's 1-for-2 on extra points, attempting both kicks two
weeks ago against Polytechnic. She's aware of the singularity of
her situation; Buck's privy to how the other half plays and works.
</P>
<P>
   She's even discovered a few misconceptions of her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls talk all the time and hug each other when they score a
goal,'' said Buck, who classifies herself as Division II soccer
material. ``Guys don't talk as much, but it shocked me the way they
encourage each other. There are some fights. They yell at each
other sometimes, and I was prepared they wouldn't care about me,
but it hasn't been that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Those doubts were quelled Sept. 17 when she tried her first
extra point in the third quarter against Polytechnic. It was
blocked as a Parrots defender bowled over both Buck and holder
Billy Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so nervous and had so much adrenaline going I couldn't
feel if it hurt or not,'' Buck said. ``Mostly, I was upset that I
missed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the quarter, she got another chance and this time she
connected. On the sideline, Stovall grinned as teammates pounded on
her helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kicking and making a field goal is such an awesome feeling,''
she said.

SUPREME COURT TO RULE ON LAW THAT ALLOWS RAPE VICTIMS TO SUE
ATTACKERS
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Va., Colo., Wash.)  (nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Taking up a case with broad implications for its
continuing reappraisal of federal power, the Supreme Court agreed
Tuesday to decide whether Congress had the authority to open the
federal courts to civil lawsuits by victims of rape, domestic
violence and other crimes ``motivated by gender.''
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the fate of a 1994 law, the Violence Against Women
Act, which Congress passed after concluding, on the basis of four
years of hearings, that state court systems were not dealing
adequately with an epidemic of violence against women. The law
created a new federal civil remedy, permitting victims to sue their
attackers for damages, including punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling last March, the federal appeals court in Richmond,
Va., declared the law unconstitutional and dismissed a suit brought
by a student at Virginia Polytechnic Institute against two fellow
students, football players who she contended had raped her in her
dormitory room shortly after the start of her freshman year in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed by Christy Brzonkala, was the first to be
brought under the law's civil damages provision, and has been
watched closely during its journey through the courts. The two men
fought the suit by arguing that the civil damages section of the
law exceeded Congress' authority to assert federal jurisdiction
over matters of traditional state concern. One defendant was
eventually punished by Virginia Polytechnic with a deferred
suspension that enabled him to complete his college football
career; the university's judicial committee took no action against
the other.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals striking
down the law was cast in very broad terms, with Judge J. Michael
Luttig, writing for the 7-4 majority, declaring that the Violence
Against Women Act ``simply cannot be reconciled with the principles
of limited federal government upon which this nation is founded.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling held that because violence against women had only
``an attenuated and indirect relationship with interstate
commerce,'' the law was not a proper exercise of congressional
authority under the Constitution's commerce clause. Nor was the law
a valid exercise of Congress' authority to enforce the equal
protection guarantee of the 14th Amendment, the 4th Circuit held,
because the law sought to regulate purely private conduct rather
than the state action at which the 14th Amendment is directed.
</P>
<P>
   Both these broad propositions place the case in the center of
the court's continuing debate over defining the boundary between
federal and state authority. In a series of decisions over the last
four years, culminating in June with three handed down on the final
day of the court's term, the court invoked principles of federalism
and sovereign immunity to circumscribe the power of Congress to
identify problems in need of uniform national solutions.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration appealed the 4th Circuit decision, as
did the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, which has represented
Ms. Brzonkala throughout the case. The justices combined the two
appeals, U.S. vs. Morrison, No. 99-5, and Brzonkala vs. Morrison,
No. 99-29, and will hear the case in January. The court had already
scheduled arguments in three other federalism cases during its new
term, which officially begins next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Both halves of the 4th Circuit's analysis have implications
beyond the specific law at issue. On the question of Congress'
power to regulate interstate commerce, the appeals court relied on
the Supreme Court's ruling in a 1995 case, U.S. vs. Lopez, which
invalidated a federal law that made it a crime to carry a gun near
a school. In that case, the justices said that the activity
involved did not have a ``substantial relation to interstate
commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   In passing the Violence Against Women Act, Congress found that
violence against women did affect the economy by, for example,
limiting women's participation in the labor force. However, the 4th
Circuit rejected those findings, raising the question of the extent
to which federal courts should defer to the rationale offered by
Congress for its actions.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit's limitations on congressional authority to
legislate under the 14th Amendment raises potential questions about
the validity of civil rights laws enacted under that authority,
since those also apply to actions by private individuals who are
not ``state actors.'' The Clinton administration is arguing that
because the states themselves have failed to address the problem of
violence against women, the issue is actually one of official
behavior and not simply of private conduct, as the 4th Circuit
viewed the question.
</P>
<P>
   While the court ordinarily waits to review a case until a
disagreement has developed among the federal appeals courts, the
justices acted Tuesday in the absence of such a conflict. The 4th
Circuit was the first appeals court to decide the constitutionality
of the Violence Against Women Act, although the law has been upheld
by 14 federal District Courts.
</P>
<P>
   The law is familiar to the justices, although they have never
ruled on it. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist criticized it both
before and after its enactment, singling it out in speeches as
another in an array of new burdens that Congress was placing on the
federal courts.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This case was one of nine new appeals the court accepted
Tuesday, in advance of the official opening of the term. The new
cases, all of which will be argued in January, bring the number of
cases on the court's argument calendar to 44, well over half the
cases the justices are likely to decide over the nine-month
duration of the term.
</P>
<P>
   These were among the other new cases:
</P>
<P>
   _ Grandparents' Rights: The court agreed to decide the
constitutionality of a Washington state law giving grandparents and
other ``third parties'' the opportunity to petition a court for
visitation rights ``when visitation may serve the best interest of
the child.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Supreme Court, in a ruling last December,
declared the law unconstitutional as violating the fundamental
rights of parents not to have the state interfere with their
child-rearing decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Only where ``the state seeks to prevent harm or a risk of harm
to the child'' can the parents' fundamental right be overcome, the
state court said, adding that ``parents should be the ones to
choose whether to expose their children to certain people or
ideas.'' Even when there is a plausible argument that continued
contact with grandparents or other relatives, following a divorce
or the death of one parent, would be beneficial to the child,
``state intervention to better a child's quality of life through
third-party visitation is not justified where the child's
circumstances are otherwise satisfactory,'' the Washington court
said.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Troxel vs. Granville, No. 99-138, is an appeal by the
parents of a man who committed suicide after fathering two
daughters by a woman to whom he was not married. After the father's
death, the mother married a man who adopted the girls. The mother
and her husband then sought to limit the girls' contact with their
paternal grandparents, who invoked the state law and won regular
visitation rights under a decision that the Washington Supreme
Court then overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Most states have laws permitting grandparents and others to seek
visitation rights, and the state courts are divided over the laws'
constitutionality.
</P>
<P>
   _ Abortion Protests: The court agreed to hear a challenge to a
Colorado law making it a crime to approach another person within a
distance of 8 feet, while in the vicinity of a health care
facility, for the purpose of distributing leaflets, displaying
signs or engaging in conversation unless invited to do so. The
challenge was brought by three anti-abortion protesters who travel
to abortion clinics around Colorado for what they call ``sidewalk
counseling,'' trying to dissuade patients from entering the clinics
for their scheduled abortions.
</P>
<P>
   A Supreme Court decision two years ago, in a case from Buffalo,
N.Y., invalidated on First Amendment grounds a portion of a court
injunction that had imposed such a ``floating buffer zone'' to
shield abortion clinic patients from protesters. The Colorado law
was ``indistinguishable on any substantive basis,'' the lawyer for
the three protesters told the court in the new case, Hill vs.
Colorado, No. 98-1856.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the Colorado law in light of the earlier decision, the
Colorado courts nonetheless upheld the provision on the ground that
a law was entitled to more deference than a court injunction. The
law was a ``legitimate exercise of the state's authority to
restrict threatening conduct immediately outside health care
facilities,'' the state told the justices in its brief.

IN SOCIAL SECURITY DEBATE, POLITICAL SYMBOLISM STILL RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SPEND-CONGRESS) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This was going to be the year that Congress and the
Clinton administration de-electrified the third rail of American
politics, putting partisanship aside to insure the long-term
viability of the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   ``So first and above all,'' President Clinton said during his
State of the Union address in January, ``we must save Social
Security for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   It never happened. Instead, Social Security proved to be as
irresistible and potent a political weapon as ever, if not more so.
And decisions by each party to use the retirement program's almost
sacred place in the hearts of voters as a club against the other
help to explain why Congress and the White House are again headed
toward a budget showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Conceding that Congress will be unable to pass the spending
bills necessary to keep the federal government operating after the
start of the new fiscal year on Friday, the House and the Senate
both passed a measure Tuesday to provide the necessary money for
three weeks while Republicans try to work out their differences
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In large part because of the way they chose to play the Social
Security card, the two sides are in a fiscal box of their own
making. Clinton blocked Republican efforts to enact a big tax cut
by arguing that projected federal budget surpluses should be set
aside until Social Security's long-term financial problems had been
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by the success of Clinton's strategy _ and fed up
with the Democratic Party's claims over many decades to be the one
true protector of Social Security _ Republicans tried to turn the
tables. Eager to advance their goal of reducing the size and
influence of federal government, they demanded earlier this year
that the president scale back his spending requests to avoid
dipping into the portion of next year's surplus generated by excess
Social Security revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe it to our constituents and our seniors to stop the raid
on Social Security,'' Rep. Wally Herger, R-Calif., said Tuesday in
supporting a nonbinding resolution passed by the House calling for
Congress not to spend the retirement system's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to cede the high ground, Clinton took the Republicans
up on their challenge this summer. But with time running out to
pull together next year's budget, neither side has a politically
realistic way of making good on its promise to keep its hands off
Social Security, at least not without resorting to wholesale
gimmickry. And both sides are largely ignoring the reality that
spending a small portion of Social Security revenues will have
little or no effect on the retirement system's long-term health or
on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be difficult for either side to gain significant
advantage,'' said Robert Reischauer, a former director of the
Congressional Budget Office who is now a fellow at the Brookings
Institution, a liberal-leaning research group. ``The Republicans
made a premature promise that was reiterated by the president. It's
something neither party could fulfill.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither party, though, is yet willing to give up, fearing that
to do so would hand the other side an explosive issue to exploit in
next year's election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like they're both trying to run feeder lines from any
available source of power to make this issue even more
electrified,'' said David John, a senior policy analyst at the
Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization. ``If you
can accuse the other side of being opposed to motherhood and the
flag, by God you'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a technical sense, spending some portion of next year's
projected Social Security surplus of $147 billion has almost
nothing to do with the longer-term issue of assuring that the
retirement system is financially sound enough to weather the
impending retirement of the vast baby boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   The government has spent excess Social Security revenues
routinely for decades without any substantial partisan debate. But
that was before the government moved from budget deficits into
surpluses and gained the luxury of differentiating between revenues
from general taxation and revenues generated by the payroll tax
that finances Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The government can do two things with its excess revenues, from
whatever source. It can spend them, or it can use them to reduce
the portion of the national debt held by the public in the form of
Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Because the baby boomers are in their peak earning years, Social
Security revenues will far exceed what is needed to pay benefits to
current retirees for another decade or two, and then will fall well
below what is needed to pay full benefits. Next year's $147 billion
Social Security surplus will reach $235 billion by 2009.
</P>
<P>
   If the Social Security surplus is used to reduce the national
debt, it will help keep interest rates low, spur additional
economic growth and leave the federal government in better
financial condition for the day when it has to begin borrowing
again to meet Social Security obligations.
</P>
<P>
   But spending a relatively small portion of the money would still
allow the government to reduce the national debt substantially in
coming years, something both parties agree should be a priority.
And spending the money _ in essence using it to cover a shortfall
in the government's general accounts _ would not in any way change
the retirement system's financial condition, since Social Security
revenues are not set aside on the government's books specifically
to pay benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Americans _ and more than a few policy-makers _ appear to
believe that using a portion of the Social Security surplus to
cover a deficit in the non-Social Security budget would constitute
a `raid' on Social Security, reducing Social Security's assets and
impairing its ability to pay benefits in the future,'' said a
recent report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a
liberal-leaning research organization. ``These beliefs, however,
are not correct and appear to be rooted in a misunderstanding of
how Social Security finances work.''
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, drawing a line in the sand over spending Social
Security revenues is an arbitrary way of deciding how to apportion
projected surpluses. It is more about political symbolism than
about policy or economic choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There desperately needs to be a decent, civil discussion about
what we do with Social Security and for that matter what we do with
our entire budget,'' said John of the Heritage Foundation. ``I'm
afraid 1999 and 2000 do not look like the years that is going to
happen.''

JUSTICES TO REVIEW LAW ALLOWING RAPE VICTIMS TO SUE ATTACKERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trim) 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court delved into the area of victims'
rights Tuesday, agreeing to decide whether a U.S. law permitting
women to sue their violent attackers in federal court is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, acting six days before their new term officially
begins, also said they would rule on the constitutionality of a
Colorado law that requires abortion protestors to be at least 100
feet from a medical facility when trying to convince pregnant women
to forgo the controversial procedure. In addition, the high court
agreed to rule on whether the Constitution gives parents the right
to prevent grandparents from seeing a grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, which will begin hearing arguments again
Monday, is expected to render its decisions in these cases by July.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is recovering from colon cancer
surgery, participated in the court's decision to hear these
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg was released from a Washington hospital Tuesday. The
Supreme Court's public information office said Ginsburg's cancer
was confined to her colon and nearby tissue and did not spread to
other parts of her body.
</P>
<P>
   In the rights case out of Virginia, the justices will review a
lower court's decision that Congress exceeded its constitutional
authority by enabling women to sue their attackers under the
federal 1994 Violence Against Women Act.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in ruling the law
invalid, threw out college freshman Christy Brzonkala's lawsuit
against fellow Virginia Tech students Antonio Morrison and James
Crawford. Brzonkala claimed the two football players pinned her
down on a dormitory bed and raped her in September 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the 4th Circuit rejected Brzonkala's argument
that Congress' powers to regulate interstate commerce and ensure
equal protection under the law gave federal lawmakers the authority
to permit women to sue their attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the appeals court said the congressional attempt
to discourage sex crimes had no relationship to the regulation of
commerce. The 4th Circuit agreed with Brzonkala that Congress can
ensure that states provide equal protection for residents but said
the anti-violence law seeks to control activities by private
citizens, not states.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Clinton administration, pressing Brzonkala's
argument before the Supreme Court, said the impact of sex crimes on
the U.S. economy gives Congress the interstate-commerce authority
to allow women to sue their attackers. The administration added
that violence against women drains between $3 billion and $5
billion annually from the national economy as victims often miss
work after they are attacked.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the administration argued that the Constitution's
Equal Protection Clause gives Congress broad authority to ensure
that states treat people equally. The federal law, by giving women
a chance to sue their attackers, ensures that female victims have
recourse even in states that might not provide them a day in court,
the administration said.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia never charged the two men in the alleged incident.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech, however, investigated and found Morrison guilty
of having violated the school's Abusive Conduct Policy and moved to
suspend him for two semesters. But the university provost deferred
the suspension until after Morrison's college football career ended
and ordered him to attend a one-hour session with an
equal-opportunity/affirmative-action compliance officer.
</P>
<P>
   University charges against Crawford were dismissed for lack of
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the Colorado case, the justices will review a state Supreme
Court decision upholding a criminal law that bars people from
speaking to, distributing leaflets to or displaying signs in front
of anybody within 100 feet of a medical facility without that
person's consent. The law was aimed at abortion protesters who seek
to block the entrances to clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents, in their successful request that the court
hear their appeal, argued that Colorado's restriction violates
their First Amendment right to free speech. The protesters said the
law limits their ability to voice their concerns while standing on
a public sidewalk, a traditional arena for constitutionally
protected political speech.
</P>
<P>
   But Colorado, in its failed attempt to convince the justices to
let the decision stand, called the law a legitimate effort to
regulate when, where and how people can express their views.
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment prevents the state from curtailing speech
that expresses specific viewpoints, such as opposition to abortion,
the state said. The law, however, is constitutional because it
prevents all speech within 100 feet of a medical facility, Colorado
argued.
</P>
<P>
   The case before the justices is reminiscent of the Texas Supreme
Court's July 1998 order that abortion protesters in Houston use a
``normal speaking voice'' when addressing women entering clinics,
and leave when the women they are trying to counsel indicate ``a
desire to be left alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas court issued its order in upholding a $1.2 million
damage award against protesters who staged large demonstrations at
Houston abortion clinics during and after the 1992 Republican
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   In the parental-rights case, the justices will consider the
constitutionality of a Washington law that gives grandparents the
right to seek visitation rights with a grandchild if such visits
are ``in the best interests of the child,'' even if the parents
object. The Washington Supreme Court has struck down the law,
ruling that it interferes with the parents' constitutional liberty
and privacy rights to raise their children as they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   The case could have widespread implications as family law judges
across the nation generally assert wide authority in matters
concerning child welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Grandparents Jennifer and Gary Troxel, in their successful
request that the court hear their appeal, said the law should be
constitutional because of the government's interest in ensuring a
child's interests are well served. In many cases, those interests
are best satisfied when children have regular contact with
grandparents, said the Troxels, who seek a court order to see their
grandchildren, Natalie and Isabelle Troxel.
</P>
<P>
   Tommie Granville, Natalie and Isabelle's mother, unsuccessfully
urged the justices to reject the grandparent's appeal. In her brief
to the justices, Granville argued that parents' right to rear their
children as they see fit supersedes the desire of grandparents to
see their grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy regarding the Troxels' visitation rights arose
after their son, Brad, the father of their grandchildren, killed
himself, and Granville limited the grandparents' access to Natalie
and Isabelle.

 &HT;    Unemployment claims rise in wake of Hurricane Floyd, flooding
 &HT;    By Tom Murphy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ Unemployment claims in the first week after
Hurricane Floyd were 10 times higher than what's considered normal,
according to Employment Security Commission officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had between 900 and 1,200 claims last week,'' said Steve
Rogers, who manages the Rocky Mount office. ``A heavy week in
September is normally between 75 and 100 applicants. It's
heart-breaking. Businesses can't operate. People can't get to work
because they've lost their transportation. Their homes have been
destroyed. They can't find day care for their children, or they
have other problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers says the Twin Counties' unemployment rate will skyrocket
in upcoming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unemployment rate will be substantial across Eastern North
Carolina,'' he said. ``It will be even higher in the Twin Counties
because we did get hit harder. The next couple of weeks are going
to be tough at this office. The aftermath of Hurricane Floyd will
be difficult for a lot of people for a long time. Some small
businesses destroyed by floodwater won't reopen. Small farmers will
have a hard time recovering, which will definitely impact all of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Milbourne, 37, sat in a chair at the Employment Security
Commission office, waiting for his turn to apply for work or to
draw unemployment benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost everything to Hurricane Floyd,'' he said. ``I lost my
home. I lost my job at Universal Leaf in Rocky Mount. The company's
building was under 7 feet of water during the flood. They lost
everything in their building. They told me to keep in touch with
them the best I could. They say they may have some of the same type
work in Wilson, but they haven't gotten back in contact with me
yet. That's why I'm here looking into getting another job.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Haese, 45, a homeless person, was living by Maple Creek.
His makeshift home was flooded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's discouraging,'' he said. ``I saved some blankets. I'm
staying with my mother temporarily. I hope to find a full-time job
and get into a motel. I had a part-time job getting apartments
ready to rent before the hurricane came.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got hope,'' said Shirley Knight, 35, of Princeville. ``I
lost my car and home to the flood. I worked at International Health
Care in Tarboro. It's gone, too. All the homes my customers lived
in are flooded. I've got no transportation to go to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight, like others who visited the office, said she wants to
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be able to get another job,'' she said. ``But it's hard
when you've got no transportation. The lost job is my main problem.
No money is another. I haven't got any. I worked one day before the
storm came, and I haven't gotten paid for it. But I've got hope.
I'm not going to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Watson, 32, of Pinetops said Floyd put him out of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hurricane cost me my job,'' he said. ``The company I
worked for constructs grain bins. I couldn't get to work. I think
I'll be able to get my job back. Right now, I need a job and money.
I've got three boys to support.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost two jobs to the hurricane,'' said Bonnie Young, 40, of
Nashville, who was employed at Bojangles in Nashville and Englewood
Baptist Church in Rocky Mount. Both the restaurant and church were
damaged by Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bojangles was under water,'' she said. ``It is being remodeled
and scheduled to reopen Oct. 20. The church said they would let me
know about my job there. My car is broken down, so in the meantime,
I hope to draw unemployment. It's tough to lose your job. It's even
tougher when you lose two and become totally unemployed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said two types of unemployment benefits are available -
regular and disaster benefits, which are based on 1998 earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person is not qualified for regular unemployment
benefits, then we take a disaster claim,'' he said. ``It may assist
them. Once we get a claim processed, a person's first check should
come in about a week. ESC will write checks as fast as it can and
get them back as quickly as possible. Regular and disaster benefits
are for six months. Hopefully, by the time benefits expire, people
will have returned to their old jobs or found other employment
opportunities. Most of the people had rather be back at work than
be in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said ESC will attempt to meet the high demand for
assistance in a time of need.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is not a gravy train that someone is going to ride,''
he said.

 &HT;    Incentives lacking to fix foster care
 &HT;    (EDS: CQ similar reporter names)
 &HT;    By Debra Jasper and Elliot Jaspin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Each year, hundreds of thousands of children
languish in America's foster-care system with little hope of
reuniting with their parents or being adopted.
</P>
<P>
   These are boom times in foster care and many child advocates say
the government is at fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money drives policy,'' said U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio,
considered on Capitol Hill to be an expert on issues affecting
children. He and others complain that agencies have little
incentive to take kids out of foster care because of the
government's open-ended commitment to pay the bills no matter how
long a child remains in the system.
</P>
<P>
   Governmental financial incentives pose a ``major, major
problem,'' DeWine said, and an overhaul is needed. But DeWine and
others are skeptical that Congress and the Health and Human
Services Department, which administers the multibillion foster-care
program, will ever bring about reform.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, DeWine waged a battle in Congress to pass the
Adoption and Safe Families Act, which is designed to boost the
number of foster children who are adopted. He said the experience
convinced him his colleagues aren't interested in doing the work
required to untangle an entrenched bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got 500,000 kids in foster care, you've got a huge
issue in this country,'' DeWine said. ``But the intricacies of
foster care are not something on Congress's radar screen.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, foster care doesn't appear to be on the radar screen of
even the officials in the administration who are paid to watch out
for foster children. Six years ago, Health and Human Services
declared a moratorium on auditing how states spend federal dollars
on foster children. The moratorium remains in place.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kharfin, Health and Human Services spokesman, said the
department is overseeing pilot programs in 12 states to develop
better accounting procedures. Although he couldn't say when,
Kharfin said new regulations are coming soon.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Carpenter, an aide to DeWine, said officials made the same
promise a few years ago, but nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``There doesn't seem to be a lot of interest in this issue,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine said the lax oversight is embarrassing. ``They can't just
throw up their hands and say, `Gee, golly, we're not going to do
it,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Hogan, executive director of Adopt America Advocates, a
lobbying group that wants more foster children adopted, said Health
and Human Services will remain ineffective unless Congress changes
the culture of foster care by putting limits on how long children
can spend in care.
</P>
<P>
   She also said the department won't properly oversee state foster
systems because it fears the states will lobby Congress to cut the
department's budget. Instead, the department placates the states,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out how to account for federal foster-care dollars
won't be easy. The federal government is struggling to get states
to comply with a law that requires them to report how well children
are doing in their care. This year, 26 states failed to give Health
and Human Services complete information despite facing millions of
dollars in federal fines.
</P>
<P>
   Some key information isn't even required.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of children, for example, die each year in foster care.
But because state and federal record keeping is so chaotic, no one
knows the exact total.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent federal data show 276 children died in foster
care in 1996, but that figure only accounts for the 17 states that
reported to the federal government that year.
</P>
<P>
   Even if foster-care officials in all the states obeyed the law,
Health and Human Services would not know why these children are
dying because Kharfin said the agency never asked.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Wexler, spokesman for the National Coalition for Child
Protection Reform in Washington, D.C., said the lack of record
keeping is another example of lax oversight in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most fundamental responsibility the state has when they
decide they are going to be a better parent is to keep that child
alive,'' Wexler said. ``States are incapable of showing when they
are messing up and why.''
</P>
<P>
   Wexler cites numerous instances in which foster kids have been
abused, neglected or killed. Like other child advocates, he wants
the foster system overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   But he said changes should put the emphasis on family
preservation, not adoption. ``The best way to fix foster care is to
have less of it. Children would be better off if services were
provided to keep the family together rather than tearing it
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   DeWine's legislation _ which did away with the requirement that
social workers use ``reasonable efforts'' to reunite children with
their biological family _ is intended to get more children out of
foster care by making it easier for them to be adopted. Critics say
it's far from enough.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler believes the law put more power in the hands of the very
foster-care agencies that benefit financially from keeping children
in care. ``We call it the foster-care agency full-employment act,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until Congress gets serious and stops paying states to keep
foster kids in care for long periods of time, Wexler said, foster
care will stay firmly entrenched in the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you create a system where the government provides financial
incentives to agencies who work with the families, then they will
work with the families,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Massinga, former head of child services in Maryland and
chief executive officer of the Casey Family Program, which has
children in foster care in 14 states, said the federal government
should tie financial incentives to the state's ability to track
outcomes. ``What gets paid for is what gets done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, we're not able to say systematically
that we're attending to (a child's) well being,'' Massinga said.
``Child-welfare systems haven't really been focused on how well
kids are doing, they've been focused on processes.'' As a result,
she said, ``kids are leaving care not prepared to handle adult
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government also should keep tabs on how states spend
the federal dollars set aside for programs to help teens learn to
live on their own, said Shelly Davalos, program coordinator for the
National Independent Living Association in Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some states are using (the money) appropriately, some are
using it inappropriately,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Which ones are which?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know,'' she said. ``The reason is there is no
reporting requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   The independent-living association wants Congress to require
states to demonstrate how they spend money on independent-living
programs and whether those programs are successful.
</P>
<P>
   And it wants states to be held accountable for what happens soon
after children are discharged from care. ``I shouldn't be able to
say the kid was discharged and reunified with their family if the
family kicked them out two days later,'' Davalos said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to demanding that states do a better job of tracking
outcomes, child advocates and others say there is another important
action the federal government can take to spur huge improvements in
the foster-care system.
</P>
<P>
   They can open it up to public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan, the executive director of Adopt America Advocates, said
foster care rarely captures lawmakers' attention because a
``conspiracy of silence'' surrounds what happens to the kids in it.
</P>
<P>
   Foster parents, social workers, agency officials and others
frequently won't discuss problems, citing privacy laws and fear of
repercussions from the agencies that employ them. In addition,
nonprofit foster-care agencies funded with taxpayer money routinely
close their books to public inspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do is our business,'' said an attorney for one foster
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan said confidentiality laws enacted to protect children now
provide cover for officials and should be re-examined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shield laws protect the system so the buck doesn't stop
anywhere,'' she said. ``I would argue the big scandal (in
Washington) has been the failure to implement any kind of reform at
all.''

CLINTON, STILL IN COUNSELING, MOVED BY `UNMERITED FORGIVENESS' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Making a rare mention of the Monica Lewinsky
scandal, President Clinton told religious leaders Tuesday that he
remains in counseling with ministers and feels moved by the
``unmerited forgiveness'' shown by his family and the public.
</P>
<P>
   A subdued and hoarse Clinton allowed the brief reflection at the
annual White House prayer breakfast, a forum he used last year to
offer an emotional apology, confess his ``sin'' and ask for
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was one of the most difficult years in my life, and
this occasion, because it has come to mean so much to me, was a
very difficult one. For those of you who were part of that, I want
to express my particular appreciation,'' Clinton told more than 100
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's sexual affair with Lewinsky, a White House intern,
roiled Washington's political waters throughout 1998 and prompted
charges of perjury, abuse of power and obstruction of justice from
independent counsel Ken Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The House in December voted to impeach Clinton, making him the
second president in U.S. history to face removal from office. He
was acquitted by the Senate in February.
</P>
<P>
   The president offered a special word of thanks to the three
ministers who serve as his counselors: Rev. Philip Wogaman of
Foundry Methodist Church in Washington; Rev. Gordon MacDonald of
the Grace Chapel Protestant Church in Massachusetts and Rev. Tony
Campolo, a professor at Eastern College in Pennsylvania. Wogaman
and MacDonald attended the breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also want you to know that we are continuing our work. It is
interesting and not always comfortable but always rewarding,''
Clinton said of their sessions. The White House later refused to
provide more information on the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the three ministers kept their word ``both to help
me and to hold me accountable. And I have kept my word to meet with
them and to work with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the scandal itself, Clinton said he has been
``profoundly moved, as few people have, by the pure power of grace,
unmerited forgiveness through grace'' from his wife and daughter,
from legions of American people and from God.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton attended the breakfast and
watched her husband intently as he gave his remarks. She also spoke
to the religious leaders, assembled in the State Dining Room, but
did not mention the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The prayer breakfast this year focused on children and violence,
especially the recent mass shootings at a Fort Worth, Texas,
church, a Los Angeles Jewish day-care center and at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The president also hinted at his own decision to seek
counseling, drawing a parallel between his situation and the
refusal of some mentally disturbed people, especially men, to ask
for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced a lot of these people are known to be
profoundly disturbed, well before they go out and kill people. A
lot of these people, especially this is true of men, I think, are
still really hung up about asking for help. I know about that.
That's a hard thing for men to do. I know about that,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he believed people would be less hesitant to seek
help from a minister than seeking counseling from a government
social office or a professional therapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that the faith community can play a major role
in protecting our children from violence, in supporting
common-sense gun legislation, in participating in our campaign
against youth violence, in forming community partnerships to
identify and intervene in the lives of people before it is too
late,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton's acquittal, the White House has worked to put the
scandal behind the administration and to focus on other issues.
News surrounding the affair flared briefly this summer when Hillary
Clinton, considering a bid for the Senate from New York, suggested
the president's childhood, marked by custody fights between his
mother and grandmother, played a role in the ``weakness'' that led
him to adultery.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart declined further comment on
the president's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no further insight to what he said. I'll leave you to
interpret it,'' he told reporters. He declined to say when or how
often Clinton has met with his counselors.
</P>
<P>
   But Lockhart said that relations between the White House and
Congress are back to normal after the contentious impeachment
fight. ``Defining it (normal) broadly, yes. I think that what we
have now is we've got a gold, old-fashioned policy debate going
on,'' Lockhart said of the budget fight underway.

<P>
   &UR; Arianna Huffington &LR;  threw a luncheon recently at her Brentwood
residence for Sen.  &UR; John McCain &LR;  and his new book, ``Faith of My
Fathers,'' and to introduce the author to her best and brightest
pals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ann Louise Bardach &LR;  writes in the latest New Yorker that McCain
greeted the crowd _ including  &UR; Larry King  &LR; and  &UR; Barry &LR; 
 &UR; Diller &LR;  _ ``on a veranda that overlooked a swimming pool, and,
beyond it, a grand lawn decorated with animal-shaped topiary.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Huffington said she liked McCain. ``All the other
candidates talk about prosperity, and I'm tired of hearing about
prosperity. He's the only one who talks about sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Speaking at a luncheon in San Francisco this week,  &UR; Peter &LR; 
 &UR; Giles &LR;  of the Tech Museum in San Jose _ a natural backdrop for
political candidates who want to demonstrate commitment to
innovation _ said that only one visiting politician had his advance
team make arrangements to pay the admission fee for himself and
entourage. It was  &UR; George W. Bush &LR; , who'll be there  &LR; Thursday &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   P.P.S. New York magazine says that George W. has already asked
 &UR; Colin Powell &LR;  to be secretary of state, and Powell is said to have
accepted. But Col.  &UR; Bill Smullen &LR; , who speaks for Powell, told the
magazine that Powell hasn't been asked and hasn't accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unreasonable to think that such an announcement would be
made at this point in time,'' said Smullen. ``It would be
premature.''
</P>
<P>
   P.P.P.S. A glance at the Amazon.com rankings of books written by
Republican presidential wannabes may be an indicator of the state
of their campaigns:
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; John McCain &LR; 's ``Faith of My Fathers, No. 11.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Pat Buchanan &LR; 's ``A Republic, Not an Empire,'' No. 26.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Steve Forbes &LR; ' ``The New Birth of Freedom,'' No. 1,502.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Dan Quayle &LR; 's ``Worth Fighting For,'' No. 20,246 (which
explains his dropping out).
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ Vanity Fair contributing editor  &UR; Dee Dee Myers &LR; , who is
married to the New York Times'  &UR; Todd Purdum &LR; , and CNN's &UR; Christiane &LR; 
 &UR; Amanpour &LR; , who is married to the State Department's  &UR; Jamie &LR; 
 &UR; Rubin &LR; , are both about three months pregnant, says the Washington
Post.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Las Vegas recently,  &UR; Patty Warren &LR;  saw  &UR; Evel Knievel &LR;  in a
sushi bar, with his ``angular, slick black'' car _ ``It looked like
Darth Vader's helmet,'' she said _ parked outside. The car had his
initials on a plate in front, and a disability sign lying on the
dashboard. Ever the valiant gent, Knievel wasn't parked in a
disability zone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Perhaps because even lay people know how to fake laughs in
social situations, it's much harder to cry than to laugh, says
actor  &UR; Jack Willis &LR; , who plays Yvan, the Joe Schmoe role in
``Art,'' at the Curran in San Francisco. ``Crying every night is
exhausting. Faking a laugh is easier than faking a cry. You can get
a lot of kinds of laughs, a million different kinds, chuckles and
guffaws. But crying is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cotter Smith &LR; , the serious-looking guy who plays Serge, the
play's intense art lover, says his hardest job is not laughing.
``It's a very funny play.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Designer &UR; Paco Rabanne &LR;  has apologized for his prediction, a
few months ago, that the space station Mir was going to crash into
Paris and destroy it. ``I don't smoke, don't take drugs and I don't
even drink,'' he said. ``Yes, maybe my imagination gets the better
of me. But I also like to provoke people.''
</P>
<P>
   _ In results that will be disquieting to anyone but only
children, McCall's says that 16 percent of 500 women surveyed said
they had a favorite child.
</P>
<P>
   _ Smart Money magazine says you shouldn't send a computer virus
with your Internet resume, which sounds like good advice, but not
so breathtakingly smart.
</P>
<P>
   _ W, a guide to what's trendy and expensive, says that  &UR; Dr. &LR; 
 &UR; Hauschka &LR; 's ``new organic makeup from Germany is the Birkenstock of
beauty products.'' This makeup is made from plants, harvested at
dawn, ``when healing properties are at their peak,'' by nonsmokers
who ``do not wear synthetic fragrances or acrylic nail polish.''
 &UR; Brad Pitt  &LR; and  &UR; Julia Roberts  &LR; are customers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;

<P>
   ``Madonna is doing a world tour next year and has asked me to
design her costumes for the concerts. But I turned her down. Far
too much trouble.''

CHECHEN REFUGEES BECOMING A PROBLEM FOR NEIGHBORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The flight of tens of thousands of Chechens from
Moscow's massive bombing campaign has raised a new fear: that the
Kremlin's push to wipe out Islamic rebels may create more problems
that it solves along Russia's volatile southern rim.
</P>
<P>
   As Russian jets struck targets within Chechnya for a sixth
straight day, officials in Ingushetia, another fragile territory in
the Caucasus, said Tuesday they were unable to handle the estimated
60,000 refugees who have fled the violence so far.
</P>
<P>
   Amid signs that Moscow plans to widen its campaign against
Chechnya, the sheer number of terrified refugees pouring out of the
breakaway region has also provoked concern that the bombs are
falling much more indiscriminately than the Kremlin claims.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow says it is targeting only sites being used by the Islamic
militants whom it blames for two armed incursions in another
strife-ridden Caucasus region, Dagestan, and a wave of bomb blasts
that killed 300 in Moscow and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechens say that civilian targets are being hit and claim
heavy casualties. Tuesday, human rights activist Sergei Kovalyov
backed the Chechens' claim, saying Russian strikes were hitting
civilians indiscriminately and accusing Moscow of ``taking actions
that . . . inevitably lead to a resumption of war _ a war that so
recently and so ingloriously ended.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has said that while Russia intends
to destroy what it considers ``bandits'' and ``international
terrorists'' operating out of Chechnya, the Kremlin also wants to
avoid a repeat of its disastrous 1994-96 campaign, which failed to
defeat the separatists and left tens of thousands of civilians
dead.
</P>
<P>
   But the military units Moscow massing on Chechnya's border look
more and more like a strike force for a possible ground offensive,
and Russian politicians and military officers are taking an
increasingly belligerent line toward the relatively moderate
government of Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Russian officials have generally acknowledged
that Maskhadov does not control the insurgents, led by field
commanders Shamil Basayev and Khattab, who invaded Dagestan last
month.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, Sergei Pryganov, a Defense Ministry spokesman based
in the Russian republic of Dagestan, where Russia lost 250 men
during a month-long battle with militants, said recent
reconnaissance reports indicated Chechen officials were helping the
militants prepare new attacks.
</P>
<P>
   That statement was the latest in a series of signs that Moscow
views Maskhadov's separatist government and alleged terrorist bases
as one and the same, a theory borne out by the targets in the
bombing so far: oil refineries and storage sites, television
facilities, a telephone exchange, cement and food processing
factories, and the residential neighborhood where Maskhadov lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechens say 300 people have died in Grozny alone. Tuesday,
eight people died when a schoolhouse outside of Grozny was hit.
Civilians started fleeing Grozny, the Chechen capital, after bombs
began falling last week. The only neighboring territory that has
been willing to take large numbers of them has been Ingushetia,
whose mainly Muslim population has ethnic and linguistic ties to
the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   But authorities in Ingushetia, impoverished and already bursting
with more than 20,000 refugees from previous conflicts in the
region, say they been overwhelmed by the new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We urgently need humanitarian aid _ temporary housing, warm
clothes, and blankets _ because we are on the doorstep of winter,''
said Ingushetia's president, Ruslan Aushev. ``The republic is
unable to cope with this problem alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingushetia briefly closed its border Sunday, but more have been
allowed to enter. Azamat Nalgiyev, a member of the Ingush
parliament, said in a phone interview from the region that the line
of cars at one border crossing was 3 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Emergency Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu, who flew to
Ingushetia, insisted ``the government will not allow a
catastrophe.'' Shoigu told Russian news agencies that 40 tons of
aid, including tents, food, and blankets, would be flown there.
</P>
<P>
   Shoigu also denied that Chechen civilians had been attacked. The
Russian military, taking a page from NATO's recent operation over
Yugoslavia, have gone out of their way to present their airstrikes
as precision attacks with little collateral damage.
</P>
<P>
   Generals have gone on television with ``before'' and ``after''
photographs of targets hit, and even released footage showing a
rocket honing in on and destroying its target.
</P>
<P>
   The footage implies a laser-guided ``smart'' bomb, but is in
fact something else: The Su-25 bombers making the strikes are armed
with rockets that are not laser-guided; the footage is coming from
Su-24 tactical aircraft armed with cameras for intelligence
gathering. ``The Russians have neither the high-precision weapons,
nor enough planes and prepared pilots to go by the Yugoslavia
blueprint,'' wrote military analyst Alexander Golts in the news
magazine Itogi.
</P>
<P>
   Golts and other analysts have speculated that airstrikes will
not achieve the objective of crushing the rebels, tempting Russia
to try ground forces. Some predict that if it continues to use
force, Moscow will have difficulty winning over even Chechens who
oppose the radical militants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the Chechens are tired of bandits, but they also remember
the marauding violence of the federal forces,'' Ruslan Khasbulatov,
a former speaker of the Russian parliament and an ethnic Chechen,
told the online publication Gazeta.ru. ``But in the event of a
ground war, all of the young people will go over to the bandits to
fight a guerrilla war.''

ROLLER-COASTER DOW FLIRTS WITH CORRECTION LEVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock market dipped into correction territory Tuesday before
a surprise rebound late in the day left the Dow Jones industrial
average virtually unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow dropped 222 points and was within 82 points of 10,000 in
the early afternoon _ nearly 12 percent below its all-time high on
Aug. 25 of 11,326.04. A 10 percent decline is officially a
correction.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dow bounced back like a yo-yo. At the end of the day,
the index had given up only 27.86 points, or a quarter of a
percentage point. The Dow is still up nearly 12 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index Tuesday lost
just 1.11 points, closing at 1282.20, while the technology-heavy
Nasdaq dipped 5.5 points, closing at 2756.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little roller coaster'' is how Ned Riley, BankBoston Corp.'s
chief investment officer, described the market activity.
</P>
<P>
   Riley attributed the swings partly to institutional investors
who may be selling positions as the third quarter draws to a close
and shareholder reports are due. They then buy stocks they wish to
hold during the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Tuesday's recovery, investment analysts said a mood of
pessimism has clearly slipped into the US market in recent weeks
amid interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, rising oil prices,
and the promise of higher returns in overseas financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Nikkei stock index Tuesday gained an astonishing 3 percent,
or 504.64 points, after the Japanese government agreed to loosen
its purse strings to stimulate economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, Doug Cliggott, stock strategist for J.P. Morgan
&AMP; Co., said a rocky ride may be in store in September and October,
typically troublesome months in the US market. J.P. Morgan does not
expect the S&AMP;P 500 index to provide much added returns through the
end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're near the beginning of what will be a trading range
market that could have some fairly violent swings, probably in both
directions,'' Cliggott predicted. ``It's a high-risk market.''
</P>
<P>
   US stocks were saved by gains in America Online Inc. and
Microsoft Corp., as the dollar strengthened against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we see the yen falling and the dollar rising, people feel
more comfortable about the US equity market,'' said Arthur Hogan,
chief market analyst for Jefferies &AMP; Co. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks also fell sharply and then recovered. American
Express Co., for example, dipped to 130 7/8 amid the market drop
but closed at 135 13/16, up 13/16.

 &HT;    School bans Pokemon cards
 &HT;    By Paul Donsky
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's no Pokemon card with the power to stop what
school officials did recently at Huddleston Elementary in Peachtree
City: ban kids from bringing the wildly popular gaming cards to
school.
</P>
<P>
   So many students were bringing Pokemon cards every day it caused
headaches for school staff, Principal Lynda Lambeth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was beginning to disrupt the learning environment,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Children were sneaking games during class, and teachers had to
deal with distraught students who had lost cards or made unwise
trades with classmates, said Sue Cleek, assistant principal at
Huddleston. She estimated one-third or more of Huddleston's 670
students brought cards to school some days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids would be playing with the cards when they weren't
supposed to be,'' Cleek said. ``It was something everyone
noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Students caught with the game will have their cards confiscated
and returned _ to their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Huddleston is not the first school to ban the game. Schools in
Iowa, Wisconsin and suburban Chicago are among those to outlaw the
cards this school year. Lambeth said several other Fayette County
schools also banned Pokemon from school grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon (short for ``pocket monster'') cards have become a craze
among the pre-teen set. Pokemon began as a Japanese TV cartoon. It
became a best-selling Game Boy cartridge before the card game
version took off.
</P>
<P>
   The object of the game is to acquire various Pokemon characters
and do battle against other people's characters. Each card has a
picture of a monster with different ``hit points'' that measure how
much damage they can inflict and how much protection they have.
</P>
<P>
   A starter set of 60 cards costs $8.99, while some packs can cost
$20 or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just trade, and we just look at cards and stuff,'' said
Colin Baker, 10, a fifth-grade student at Huddleston who estimates
he has about 400 Pokemon cards.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-grader Jocelyn Clarke said she was glad the game was
banned.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids _ they weren't doing their work. They were just
playing with the Pokemon cards,'' she said. ``Some people were
fighting about them.''

N.H. SETS EARLIEST-EVER PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Presidential candidates may find themselves knocking on doors on
Christmas Day, as New Hampshire Tuesday officially set its primary
for Feb. 1, the earliest date in history.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State William Gardner's decision had an immediate
domino effect: Campaigns began accelerating their strategies and
schedules; hotels began rearranging reservations for the candidates
and their massive media retinue; and distressed Iowa officials
began pressuring national party leaders to stop the early-primary
scramble.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner picked the Feb. 1 date because Delaware Republicans were
planning on holding their primary on Feb. 8. New Hampshire law
requires its primary to be held at least seven days before any
similar election.
</P>
<P>
   But Gardner's decision threw Iowa officials into turmoil, since
they had been planning on holding presidential caucuses on Jan. 31.
By state law, Iowa must hold its event eight days before the next
caucus or primary. But Iowa Secretary of State Chet Culver said no
one in Iowa wants to move the caucuses back even further to
accommodate New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have decided as a group that the best solution to this
would be to move the Republican date in Delaware to the 15th, have
New Hampshire hold its primary on the 8th and Iowa on the 31st,''
said Culver, who has conferred with the chairs of the Iowa
Democratic and Republican parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the question is, what are we going to do about it?''
Culver said.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa officials are hoping to enlist the aid of Republican
National Committee chairman Jim Nicholson to persuade Delaware
Republicans to hold their primary later. But RNC officials said
it's up to the states to make their own decisions about elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``State parties know best when to have their primaries and
caucuses,'' said Mark Pfeifle, an RNC spokesman. ``They shouldn't
have Washington tell them what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Basil Battaglia, the chairman of the Delaware Republican Party,
was baffled at the Iowans' reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball's not in my court,'' he said, suggesting that Iowa
officials should pressure New Hampshire officials. ``We were pretty
happy that New Hampshire went on the first.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached at home Tuesday night, Gardner said he has no intention
of budging, despite Iowa's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've waited a long time to actually set the date,'' he said.
``We're trying to let the candidates and the people prepare in this
state.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, many states have moved up their primaries in
order to exert more influence on the selection of presidential
nominees. The result for the 2000 campaign is that 35 states are
planning to hold primaries or caucuses before March 14, giving
candidates little time to move from state to state and requiring
them to raise large sums of money in order to compete effectively.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Gardner's decision was hailed as an antidote
to the frontloading of the primary process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an excellent idea,'' said Hugh Gregg, the former
Republican governor. ``It will serve the country better, because
we'll sooner winnow the candidates than we normally do and it will
help candidates get organized better for the bigger states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose that Gary Bauer wins,'' Gregg continued. ``He needs
some time to raise some money to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Jim Splaine, the Portsmouth Democrat who wrote
the original 1975 law that requires a seven-day window between the
state's primary and any similar election, called Gardner ``a
genius,'' for his decision to create some breathing room between
New Hampshire and the later states.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, New Hampshire is correcting the mistakes of the
other states,'' Splaine said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Governor Jeanne Shaheen said the governor
supports Gardner's decision because she believes it is important to
protect New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary status.
</P>
<P>
   Most campaigns had banked on competing in the Granite State on
Feb. 8, but Secretary of State William Gardner made no secret this
year that he would set the date as early as necessary to protect
the primary tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, most of the campaigns said they would be ready for the
ballots to be cast on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it has any effect on the governor or the
campaign effort here,'' said Joel Maiola, the New Hampshire
campaign manager for Texas Governor George W. Bush. ``We're ready
to go any time it's set.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Longabaugh, New Hampshire state director for Democrat Bill
Bradley, said he always anticipated there would be a short window
between the first of next year and the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting Feb. 8, but a week's difference doesn't
tactically or strategically alter our plans in any real way,''
Longabaugh said. ``We're still 4 1/2 months out.''
</P>
<P>
   Over at Vice President Gore's Manchester headquarters, spokesman
Douglas Hattaway said the campaign's plans are being moved up a
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us tighter deadlines for reaching our goals,
particularly in terms of voter contact, going door-to-door and
calling people on the phone,'' he said.

TEXAS MAN SUES CRUISE LINE OVER FALL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Fla.) 
 
By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Houston man has sued Miami-based Royal Caribbean
cruise line over an unexpected splash he received during a Hawaiian
vacation earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Perlmutter, 79, says in the state district lawsuit he
filed Monday that while on the trip, he discovered that he and
other passengers would have to ``negotiate a wooden gangplank'' to
enjoy the beauty of the Hawaiian islands.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Branch, Perlmutter's attorney, said the cruise ship
Legend of the Seas is too large to dock at the port of Lahaina,
Maui, where the incident happened. He said passengers are required
to walk a gangplank from the cruise ship to a smaller vessel,
called a tender, that can dock.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit said that on Jan. 2, 1999, ``while (Perlmutter) was
attempting to get from the ship to the tender, (Perlmutter) fell
into the water up to his armpits and sustained serious and
permanent injuries to his body.''
</P>
<P>
   Branch said Perlmutter did not require immediate medical
attention, but he will likely need surgery on his right knee
because of damage caused by the fall. He said Perlmutter will seek
less than $75,000 but declined to say exactly how much.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney said the waters were choppy at the time because of
an approaching front, and the smaller vessel was moving around
because it was not properly anchored. He said Perlmutter did not
fall off the side of the the gangplank, which was about 8 feet wide
and 15 feet long with no handrails. The accident occurred as
Perlmutter stepped off the gangplank to get on the tender.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Perlmutter) went to step on the tender, and all of a
sudden there was no tender,'' Branch said, explaining the smaller
ship was moved by the rough seas.
</P>
<P>
   Branch said the cruise line should have had employees assist
Perlmutter off the gangplank in the choppy waters, and it should
have made sure the smaller ship was stable.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean spokeswoman Lynn Martenstein said it is the
company's understanding that Perlmutter sustained minor injuries.
She declined to comment further on the lawsuit because of the
pending litigation.
</P>
<P>
   She said gangplanks are safe and are commonly used to get
passengers to ports where large cruise ships cannot dock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any other incidents when this has happened,''
Martenstein said. ``It's a routine procedure, and we have staff
assisting people.''
</P>
<P>
   Branch said he would not equate the dangers of walking the
gangplank with ``walking the plank'' on pirate ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if it conjures up piracy, that's fine,'' he said.
</P>

FORMER DAY CARE OPERATOR HEADED BACK TO JAIL

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts' highest court rejected Tuesday Cheryl
Amirault LeFave's last-ditch bid for a new hearing, which means she
almost certainly will be returning to prison within a week to
continue serving time for molesting children.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Supreme Judicial Court overturned a judge's
decision granting a new trial to LeFave, who was convicted in 1987
with her late mother, Violet Amirault, of sexually abusing children
at her family's Malden day care center.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the SJC denied LeFave's request to reconsider that
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, said James L. Sultan, one of LeFave's attorneys,
``I think it's a virtual certainty she's going back'' to prison.
</P>
<P>
   A Middlesex Superior Court judge is expected to reinstate
LeFave's original conviction and 8- to 20-year sentence within a
week, Sultan said. A court date had not been scheduled as of
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Sultan also said that Harvard law professor Charles Ogletree,
director of Harvard's Criminal Justice Institute, has joined
LeFave's legal team.
</P>
<P>
   LeFave's attorneys have said they may begin a federal court
appeal of her conviction or seek clemency from Governor Paul
Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   They also have said that if LeFave is sent back to prison they
will ask for an early parole hearing, although LeFave does not
intend to admit to any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   LeFave has steadfastly insisted that she, her mother and her
brother, Gerald, were wrongly convicted. She eight years of her
sentence before being released in 1995, when a Superior Court judge
overturned her and her mother's convictions.
</P>
<P>
   During their imprisonment, LeFave and her mother, who died of
cancer in 1997, repeatedly were denied parole, apparently because
they refused to admit guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Amirault was convicted in 1986 and is serving a 30- to
40-year sentence. He has lost three appeals and remains in prison.

 &HT;    Bradley unveils plan for health care changes, calls Gore's plan
'timid'
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAN NUYS, Calif. _ Presidential hopeful Bill Bradley on Tuesday
delivered on his promise to be a candidate of ``big ideas,''
unveiling a health care plan that would scrap most of the Medicaid
program for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bradley's sweeping proposal, uninsured Americans would be
able to enroll in the same private health care plans available to
federal employees and members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of Bradley's plan, which would require coverage for all
children under the age 19 whose parents cannot afford it, is to
cover 95 percent of the nation's 44 million uninsured, with the
federal government subsidizing all or part of the premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's proposal would essentially take the federal government
out of the business of directly paying the medical costs of people
in Medicaid, and instead transform Uncle Sam into one of the
largest subsidizers of private health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he would fund the program's $55 to $65 billion
estimated cost out of budget surpluses not generated by Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good health care is a right,'' said Bradley. ``And it is up to
us to ensure that right to every American.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley seized on a potent issue in the Democratic primary
against Vice President Gore, and he used his speech here to cast
himself as a bold thinker capable of bold reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said his plan would cover more people and elevate
affordable health care to one of government's primary
responsibilities. Gore's plan, announced earlier this month, would
use an existing Medicaid program to cover all children and offer
tax incentives for their parents to purchase coverage as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is between trying to do something big to deal
with a big problem that affects virtually all Americans and
continuing to be one advocating incremental change,'' Bradley said
after his speech. ``What he's proposed is definitely timid compared
to what we have proposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also criticized Gore for not putting a cost estimate on
his proposal. ``A campaign proposal without a price tag is just
another politician's promise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elaine Kamarck, a policy adviser to the Gore campaign, said
Bradley had failed to address the long-term solvency of Medicare
and said his proposal would be too expensive. ``You can't afford to
do this and begin to keep Medicare solvent,'' Kamarck said. ``The
vice president's approach works. This approach doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did not estimate how many new federal workers would be
needed to administer the program, nor did he address concerns that
some people would leave private plans to join the government
program.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would end the Medicaid program for children and steer
those children into the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program,
a network of about 400 private insurers that offers subsidized
health insurance to nation's nine million federal workers.
</P>
<P>
   The government would fully subsidize the $1,200 premium for
children whose families earn up to 200 percent of the poverty
level, or $32,800 per year for a family of four, and provide
partial subsidies for families who earn up to 300 percent of the
poverty level, or $49,200 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Premium payments for all Americans would be excluded from income
for income tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would also pay the estimated $1,800 premium for all
adults to enroll in the federal employee program, if their income
was at the poverty line. A partial government subsidy would be
available for adults earning more.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal drew immediate praise from groups advocating
universal health care coverage for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really creates a mechanism to create affordable coverage,
even to those that are at high risk,'' said Gail Shearer, director
of health policy at the Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Shearer said Gore's plan failed to offer deep
enough subsidies to insure universal coverage. But Ron Pollack,
director of Families USA, who praised Bradley's plan, nevertheless
cautioned that it might be more difficult to enact because it
involved more wholesale change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is broader and would cover more people,'' said Pollack,
whose group also advocates universal coverage. ``Gore builds more
on existing proposals and may be easier to achieve.''

GORE PROPOSES $65 BILLION-A-YEAR HEALTH CARE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tackling an issue that nearly wrecked the
Clinton-Gore administration, Bill Bradley, Al Gore's chief rival to
succeed President Clinton, proposed a $65 billion-a-year health
care plan Tuesday. The plan would require parents to pay for
children's coverage, and would provide subsidies to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's plan is far different from the program that Clinton
tried to pass in 1994. But Bradley's proposal, unveiled in a Los
Angeles speech, had the effect of highlighting one of the biggest
failures of his opponent's administration, while demonstrating
Bradley's willingness to campaign to the left of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has proposed that children be given universal access
to health care by 2005, the vice president's plan does not go as
far as Bradley's proposal in covering adults. Some of the
Republican candidates, including front-runner George W. Bush, have
not yet said how they would help the 45 million uninsured
Americans, while others such as Steve Forbes have suggested tax
breaks as the main solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to America's health, this is not the time to be
timid,'' Bradley said. ``It requires bold action and a national
commitment from the president on down to make certain that every
American has what should be a basic birthright.''
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the day was noteworthy for Bradley, who is on the
cover of this week's Time magazine and has been the subject of
speculation that he could beat Gore for the nomination. After
months of saying he would campaign on ``big ideas'' such as health
care, Tuesday marked the first time Bradley spelled out a detailed
proposal and its cost. He plans to deliver similar speeches soon on
child care, poverty, and other family issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign Tuesday scoffed at the enormous cost of
Bradley's proposal and criticized the former New Jersey senator for
failing to guarantee the survival of Medicare. But Bradley got a
good reception for his plan from normally opposing sides of the
health care debate _ the insurance industry and a leading consumer
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, officials of the Health Insurance Association of
America, which ran the famous ``Harry and Louise'' ads that helped
kill the Clinton health plan, spoke favorably about the Bradley
plan, which presumably would help millions of new customers to buy
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Bradley consulted frequently with the HIAA in an
effort to develop a plan that would win the backing of the
health-insurance industry. ``Bradley has taken a step forward,''
said Dean Rosen, the HIAA's general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Families USA, a health consumer organization that has
been at the forefront of the fight for universal coverage,
applauded Bradley's plan. Ron Pollack, the association's executive
director, said Bradley's plan is more sweeping than the one
proposed by Gore, but Pollack said the lower cost of the vice
president's proposal could make it more acceptable to Congress. But
the best news to Pollack is that presidential candidates are
seriously discussing health care.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's plan would put the initial responsibility for
children's health insurance on parents, with the government
providing subsidies only if adults are deemed too poor to pay for
it. For example, a family of four with an income less than $32,000
would receive a full, $1,200-per-child subsidy to pay for a
federally approved health care plan. The subsidies would decrease
on a sliding scale and be fully phased out for families with an
income above $49,200.
</P>
<P>
   Adults would also be eligible for subsidies, but would have to
meet lower income guidelines, with subsidies phased out for those
earning above $32,800. Those paying health insurance premiums out
of their own funds would be allowed to deduct that amount from
their income for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bradley proposed providing prescription drug
coverage for senior citizens, costing $10 billion; revamping the
Medicaid system, which currently is partially financed by the
states; and allowing anyone to enroll in a health care program used
by federal employees.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley stressed that his plan would expand the current system,
not replace it. ``For those who are now insured and satisfied with
their plans, nothing will change,'' Bradley said in the speech at
Los Angeles Valley College.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from clear whether such an expensive program would
ever get through Congress. Bradley would use the budget surplus
generated during the Clinton-Gore administration to help pay for
his program, with some of the costs absorbed by eliminating waste
in the current system.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Kamarck, who is advising Gore on domestic policy,
criticized Bradley's proposal, saying, ``The numbers simply don't
add up.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kamarck said ``there is nothing bad in this plan,'' it
does nothing to solve ``the most basic problem, and that is the
solvency of Medicare.'' She said she could find nothing in
Bradley's plan that would pay the $374 billion, 10-year cost of
saving Medicare, though Bradley's Web site says the plan
``preserves Medicare.''

MEXICAN OPPOSITION PARTIES FAIL TO UNITE BEHIND ONE PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Talks among opposition parties to forge a
coalition that would back a single presidential candidate collapsed
on Tuesday, greatly increasing the chances that the party that has
controlled Mexico for seven decades will win power once again in
elections next year.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown of talks to form a coalition is a huge setback for
Mexican voters who hoped to see an opposition leader take the
presidency and its vast powers away from the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, which has elected every president since the
1920s. The results of recent opinion polls as well as most state
elections across the country show that these voters are in the
majority.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition could handily beat the governing party, or the
PRI, in the vote on July 2, 2000, if the parties and factions
joined forces. But if the opposition is divided among two or more
candidates, as will now be the case, each one will face an uphill
battle.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown came after four months of nearly round-the-clock
negotiations between the right-of-center National Action Party,
known as the PAN, and the other main opposition group, the
left-leaning Party of the Democratic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the PAN and its presidential candidate, Vicente Fox
Quesada, made the decision to reject the coalition. The PAN, a
pro-business party, could not muster enough trust in the Party of
the Democratic Revolution, which has often been its fierce
ideological opponent, to accept a face-off in a nationwide primary
to select a single candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The issue on which the coalition foundered was the rockiest one.
The two parties could not agree on how to choose between Fox, who
initiated his quixotic quest for presidency two years ago, and
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, the leader of the leftist party.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas resigned on Tuesday as mayor of Mexico City to launch
his third bid presidential bid. He is believed to have won once, in
1988, only to have it stolen from him by fraud.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The opposition parties named a council of 14 distinguished
citizens to come up with a method to break the deadlock. The
council suggested a hybrid approach combining proposals from the
two parties. It called for a primary of pre-registered voters to be
held with 12,000 polling stations across the country (far fewer
than in a regular national election), whose results would be
reninforced by opinion polls before the balloting and exit polls
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The Party of the Democratic Revolution as well as six other
small opposition parties that participated the coalition talks
accepted the council's plan.
</P>
<P>
   But in announcing the PAN's decision on Tuesday, Diego Fernandez
de Cevallos, a veteran PAN leader and its lead negotiator in the
talks, called the plan ``simply aberrant.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary ``is based on no electoral law and has no
authorities to monitor it and guarantee its fairness,'' Fernandez
de Cevallos said. ``Frankly, we are not interested in participating
in something so irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled an election Cardenas' organization held in March to
choose its own president. The first time around, the election ended
in chaos as the contenders loudly accused each other of vote
tampering. That election had to be canceled and a new, better
organized one held two months later.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez added that the citizens' council had failed to clarify
what would happen if the primary gave one result and the polls
turned up another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico doesn't come to an end if there is no alliance,'' he
said dismissively in a television interview early Tuesday. ``Mexico
will still be here.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the height of its powers in the 1960s and '70s the PRI faced
no serious opposition and won most elections by huge margins. But
the party's popularity eroded in the '90s as extravagant corruption
by its leaders came to light while millions of Mexicans were driven
into penury by its disastrous economic management.
</P>
<P>
   In recent elections, the PRI has shown it has the solid support
of about 40 percent. Consistent support for the PAN is slightly
below 30 percent, as is the showing for the Party of the Democratic
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans overwhelmingly wanted the opposition to join together.
In a national poll published on Tuesday morning by the daily
newspaper Reforma, 63 percent said they were in favor of the
opposition coalition while 24 percent were not.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also showed the chasm that has opened among voters. Fox
was favored to be the coalition candidate by 60 percent of those
interviewed, while only 19 percent favored Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles to a partnership between the two big opposition
parties were legion. Many PAN followers are fervent Catholics. The
party favors free trade and independent entrepreneurs and is
opposed to a dominant role for the state in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Party of the Democratic Revolution, by contrast, descends
from the tradition of Cardenas' father, the fondly-remembered
president who nationalized Mexico's oil industry. Its members
believe strongly in the country's strict separation of church and
state.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties have waged angry policy battles over the $96
billion bank bail-out and plans to privatize the electrical
industry, among other hot debates.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The coalition was also hampered by a restrictive federal
electoral law, written by the PRI, which makes alliances all but
impossible. In order to run a single presidential candidate, the
opposition parties also had to settle on one candidate for every
one of the hundreds of seats in the federal legislature, which also
has elections next year, and reduce television air time and
campaign spending to fit the limits for one party. The opposition
battled unsuccessfully to relax the law.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, the coalition must register formally by Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Fox's calculation was that he could continue to build his lead,
PAN officials said. If he is still ahead of Cardenas by an
indisputable margin as the election draws near, the law allows
Cardenas to step aside and deliver his voters to Fox.
</P>
<P>
   PAN officials said they feared that the rank-and-file of
Cardenas' party or the PRI would rig the election against Fox. They
were afraid that an ugly opposition feud over the results in
November, when the PRI is holding its own primary, would sink the
chance for any opposition candidate to win next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't make good sense to accept this proposal because the
risks were just too high,'' said Santiago Creel Miranda, who had
been the most devoted proponent of the alliance within the PAN.
</P>
<P>
   But many Mexicans were saddened by the sense that a historic
opportunity had been lost.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Camacho, the head of one of the smaller opposition
parties, said, ``If Vicente Fox is not capable of facing a primary
election when he has a two-to-one advantage, he doesn't deserve to
be the leader of the opposition _ or of Mexico.''

HUNDREDS TRY TO SIGN UP FOR TEST OF NEW CANCER DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hundreds of cancer patients jammed a hotline, clicked
on World Wide Web sites and applied by fax Tuesday as recruitment
opened in Boston for a few volunteers to take the most widely
publicized new cancer drug in years.
</P>
<P>
   The medical centers set to carry out the first human clinical
trials of endostatin, an experimental drug that shrank tumors in
mice with no harmful side effects, will continue to accept calls
and faxes until next Monday for the first round of tests.
</P>
<P>
   The hotline staffed by four cancer nurses opened at 8 a.m.
Tuesday, and had received more than 1,300 calls by 2:30 p.m., said
a spokesman for Dana Farber/Partners Cancer Care, which is
conducting the trial in collaboration with Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Many other patients downloaded forms from the Internet and faxed
them to a toll-free number.
</P>
<P>
   Calls were so heavy when the hotline opened that some callers
gave up, but by afternoon there was only a short wait, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who declined to give her name told the Globe that she
had called the hotline on behalf of her mother-in-law who has lung
cancer. Finally, she said, she got the forms from the Internet,
filled them out and sent them from a commercial fax machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been following the news ever since Dr. (Judah) Folkman
announced such good results in animals,'' said the woman, referring
to the Children's Hospital researcher in whose lab endostatin was
discovered. ``It's a very small study,'' she said of the trial that
just opened, ``but we hope it will go very well and be opened to
the public on a wider basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phase 1 study, as it's called, will enroll only 15 to 30
patients in Boston: two other studies not yet begun, at M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and the University of Wisconsin
in Madison, will each recruit about the same number.
</P>
<P>
   The Phase 1 study is designed only to see how well patients
tolerate an escalating dose of the drug, and to check for side
effects. Effectiveness would be evaluated in later phases.
</P>
<P>
   To be eligible, patients must have solid tumors that don't
respond to any treatment, but they must also be mobile and have at
least six months' life expectancy. A source said that a number of
people who called in Tuesday would not qualify for the trial
because they are currently receiving chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The hotline number is 617-632-5100. On the World Wide Web, use
any of these sites: www.dana-farber.net/endostatin;
www.cancer.mgh.harvard.edu; or
www.bidmc.caregroup.org/endostatin/default.asp.
</P>
<P>
   The first patients will begin taking the drug in about two
weeks.

BLAIR SPURS LABOR PARTY TO MOUNT CRUSADE FOR DUAL MISSION  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOURNEMOUTH, England _ In a speech aimed at stirring his party
from any complacency over its success, Prime Minister Tony Blair on
Tuesday summoned Labor delegates to a crusade with the twin
missions of winning the next election over the Conservatives and
conquering the next century for the ``progressives.''
</P>
<P>
   He appealed to his audience at the party conference here to
adapt to change in a new century with the same confidence it had
transformed itself. He said he wanted ``New Labor, confident at
having modernized itself, now the new progressive force of British
politics which can modernize the nation and sweep away those forces
of conservatism to set our people free.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair noted that the Labor Party had run Britain for only 22 of
the 100 years since the party was founded and had never succeeded
in securing two full consecutive terms in office. ``That,'' he
said, ``is our unfinished business.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair delivered his 54-minute speech with a sweat-browed passion
and a distant visionary gaze that enrapture his followers but bring
scorn from critics who mock them as more suitable for the pulpit
than the stump.
</P>
<P>
   His address to the delegates, his sixth as party leader and
second as prime minister, came at a time when Labor's strategy must
be one of managing success and holding off oversatisfaction. The
weakened opposition Conservatives with their untested leader,
William Hague, present little challenge, and Labor Party leaders
have been searching for purpose now that the grip on power is
secure.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is so sure of a Labor victory in the general election
to be held in two years that the press busied itself this week
creating an uproar over whether Blair would insist on running for a
third term seven years from now, trying to rival Margaret
Thatcher's 11 years in office, or stand aside in favor of his chief
lieutenant, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show voters still giving Blair the highest approval
ratings of any prime minister in Britain's history and barely
register the kinds of public doubts and disappointments that
generally set in by the third year of a new government. But the
surveys reflect contentment rather than overt enthusiasm for him,
and low turnouts in recent by-elections have caused concern at
party headquarters over complacency.
</P>
<P>
   Aware too that he is faulted for appearing smug, Blair listed
all the steps left to take in critical areas like health,
education, transport, crime, child poverty and the ``social
exclusion'' of large numbers of Britons. ``Halfway through one
Parliament -- nothing like halfway toward meeting all our goals,''
he declared. ``Do you think I don't feel this in every fiber of my
being?''
</P>
<P>
   He did claim a victory for the transformed Labor Party that he
said would stand it in good stead in its ambition to become as
dominant a party in the new century as the Conservatives were in
this. Noting the unexpected growth and stability of Britain's
economy since Labor's election in May 1997, he said, ``Our historic
reputation for compassion has now been matched by one for economic
competence.''
</P>
<P>
   He told delegates of the party, founded a century ago to
represent the laboring class, that the class war was over but that
the struggle for true equality of opportunity for everyone was just
beginning. ``The 21st century will not be about the battle between
capitalism and socialism,'' he said, ``but between the forces of
progress and the forces of conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   The tightly controlled annual conference of the party that Blair
calls New Labor bears little resemblance to the bruising affairs of
the past, usually held in the Irish Sea working-class getaway of
Blackpool rather than this prosperous Channel resort with its
brightly painted beach cabanas and grand cliffside hotels.
</P>
<P>
   While the chairman, Michael Cashman, opened Tuesday's session
with the traditional ``Good morning, comrades'' salutation, the
talk in the corridors, jammed with commercial displays, was of
enterprise, productivity, competitiveness, markets, fiscal
stability and family values.
</P>
<P>
   The only commotion took place outside the hall where 20,000
people from rural communities around Britain marched down
Bournemouth's main street chanting their protests of Blair's plans
to ban fox hunting. They say the move will bring about the end of
all countryside sports and do away with many of their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Blair referred to ``all those hunting horns outside the hall''
and said, ``Mind you, with all those people here demonstrating,
there has never been a safer day for foxes in Britain.''

 &HT;    Battered Coca-Cola trades below $50
 &HT;    By Henry Unger and Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shares of Coca-Cola traded under $50 Tuesday for the
first time in nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
   The stock hit another 52-week low of $49.56 1/4 before closing
at $50.75, down 25 cents. The shares last traded below the $50
threshold in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's shares have had a stunning fall since July 14, 1998,
when they closed at $87.93 3/4, giving the company a market value
of $217.13 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the plunging shares have erased $91.82 billion of
shareholder wealth, at least on paper. The company now has a market
value of $125.31 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Until its recent troubles, Coca-Cola had been considered by many
investors to be an unparalleled money machine. A hundred dollars
invested in the company on Dec. 31, 1993, would have turned into
$318 five years later.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, Coca-Cola was America's second-most-valuable
company, after General Electric. But with investors flocking to
technology stocks and with Coca-Cola's sales and earnings under
pressure, partly because of weak overseas economies, the company
has tumbled in the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   It's now America's 17th-most-valuable company.
</P>
<P>
   About half of Coca-Cola's shares are held by individuals, with
the other half owned by institutional investors. The Robert W.
Woodruff Foundation and related family foundations own a total of
118,572,262 shares. The foundations last year reported total
combined assets of nearly $8.87 billion, most of it in Coca-Cola
stock. Those shares were worth about $7.94 billion at the end of
1998. Today, they're worth about $6.02 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in the stock's value has been more pronounced in recent
weeks, in tandem with the market's general decline. For example,
Coca-Cola's shares closed as high as $70.50 on May 5.
</P>
<P>
   But the shares also have been hurt by the company's Sept. 3
announcement that it would not meet analysts' earnings
expectations. That's partly due to this summer's European health
scare involving the company's soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 30 days, Coca-Cola's shares have lost 18.2 percent
of their value, making them the fifth-worst performer among the
giant blue chip issues that make up the Standard &AMP; Poor's 100-stock
index. Year-to-date, Coca-Cola is the ninth-worst performer of the
S&AMP;P 100, with a loss of 24.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not surprising that analysts are divided in their
opinion of the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Among 16 analysts surveyed by First Call, only one rates
Coca-Cola a ``strong buy.'' Seven rate the company a ``buy.''
Another seven rate it a ``hold.'' One analyst advises investors to
``sell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a well-below-average recommendation for the S&AMP;P 500
companies right now,'' said Chuck Hill, research director of First
Call. ``Obviously, they've had a tough period here.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Andrew Conway of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said he
remains cautious about the company in the short term. But Conway
still believes long-term investors will be rewarded for their
patience. He predicts the stock will be trading in the $75 range by
the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is this is a terrific buying opportunity in the long
term,'' added analyst Marty Romm of Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, however, Romm thinks Coca-Cola will have
trouble generating a lot of buying interest until it and several
other consumer nondurable companies start to improve their sales
and earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts recently have been trimming their earnings forecasts
for Coca-Cola. The mean forecast this year is $1.30 a share,
according to IBES International. The high is $1.33, and the low is
$1.27. Coca-Cola earned about that much in 1996, when it posted
$1.29 a share.
</P>
<P>
   For next year, the average estimate is $1.53 a share. The high
is $1.60, and the low is $1.48.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's closing price, Coca-Cola's shares are trading at 39
times estimated 1999 earnings.
</P>
<P>
   At least one money manager isn't yet convinced they are a
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if it got to 30 times earnings, or close to the market
multiple, I would be attracted to it,'' said Robert Sanborn of the
Oakmark Fund, which has $5.5 billion in assets.

Journal-Constitution, Atlanta, Ga.

`POPULAR' MAY NOT BE, AND `WORK WITH ME' IS TOO MUCH WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where NBC's ``Freaks and Geeks'' seems so real, so accessible in
its treatment of the adolescent quest for acceptance, The WB's
``Popular'' seems so not.
</P>
<P>
   Carly Pope and Leslie Bibb, two of The WB's latest
cover-girls-to-be, play opposites in the high school spectrum. Pope
is Sam McPherson, cynical member of the out crowd; Bibb is Brooke
McQueen, reigning queen of the popular scene.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a too-long, two-part premiere that starts
Wednesday and ends Thursday night in the show's regular time slot,
Sam and Brooke discover they're about to become siblings of a sort
when Sam's widowed mom and Brooke's divorced dad announce plans to
get married.
</P>
<P>
   This subtle-as-a-brick melding of the outs and the ins is rife
with possibilities, but ``Popular'' needs to overcome some basic
problems before it answers the can't-we-all-just-get-along
question. For one thing, the writers need to assume we're smarter
than the average hubcap and quit writing clumsy expository
information into the dialogue. In one such ``exposition,'' the
school's drama coach lets us know the principal characters and
basic plot of ``South Pacific'' (presumably because The WB's young
viewers might not be familiar with it). All it does is insult the
audience and demean the performer.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the acting needs to improve. Bibb is the show's standout
as the popular girl with demons of her own, but Pope isn't entirely
convincing as the outsider harboring a secret desire to fit in.
Same goes for the supporting cast. Some are pros, notably Tamara
Mello as a feisty activist and Sara Rue as the overweight
cheerleader wannabe, but others appear to be graduates of the
``Saved by the Bell'' school of the performing arts.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Popular'' is going to be popular, it might want to crib
from ``Freaks and Geeks'' or, even better, ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer,'' which has been doing the teenage-angst thing to near
perfection for three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS comedy ``Work With Me'' has the engaging Nancy Travis
and the funny Kevin Pollak playing husband-and-wife lawyers. He
works for a stuffy Wall Street firm until he fails to make partner
and quits in a huff, burning all bridges and access ramps on his
way out. Given few options, he joins his wife's one-person ``Sesame
Street'' practice, and the story line is set: husband and wife
together 24 hours, he with an assistant who's dating his wife's
assistant, but the assistants don't want anyone to know.
</P>
<P>
   Some genuinely funny moments emerge in ``Work With Me,'' but a
big obstacle for the viewer may be accepting that Pollak and Travis
_ or Jordan and Julie Better _ are husband and wife. Somewhat
reminiscent of Paul Reiser in ``Mad About You,'' Pollak seems to be
playing his wisecracking, standup-comic self as opposed to a
character in a comedy series. Travis also seems to be playing to
the audience, not to her colleagues onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Since it's mainly a directorial problem, the chemistry in ``Work
With Me'' could improve as it goes along. But the premise's ability
to sustain a long run remains iffy _ how many marital/workplace
dustups can we take? _ and the inevitable comparison to ``Will &AMP;
Grace'' leaves ``Work With Me'' wanting.
</P>
<P>
   True, the two supporting players in ``Work With Me'' _ Ethan
Embry and Emily Rutherfurd _ get some funny lines, but they're no
match for Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally. Viewers willing to work
with this show may get something out of it, but watching a sitcom
shouldn't have to be work.

   LOS ANGELES _ On Wednesday night, in a Beverly Hills hotel
ballroom best known as the site of the Golden Globes, Henry Warren
Beatty, actor, writer, producer, director and Democrat, will make a
speech on global trade, campaign finance and social justice, his
friends say. He may _ or may not _ say something about running for
president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The cheerleader-in-chief for a Beatty candidacy is Arianna
Huffington, a Republican political columnist not known for
embracing McGovern Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Among his kitchen cabinet of kibitizers and wordsmiths is
Patrick Caddell, the reformed pollster and strategist who advised
Jimmy Carter and Jerry Brown and now writes for ``The West Wing,''
a television series about the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Among the media throng expected to cover the speech is George
Stephanopoulos, the former White House aide who is now a political
analyst for ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   Could Hollywood make this stuff up?
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy enough to poke fun at Beatty, a legendary
lady-killer and famously diffident star who for 40 years has been a
cocky and enigmatic presence in the popular imagination, from
``Splendor in the Grass,'' to ``Bulworth.'' He is, after all, one
of the men about whom an old girlfriend, Carly Simon, wrote
``You're So Vain.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an age in which political careers are born, live and die
in the media, in which a former professional wrestler is governor
of Minnesota, an electronics billionaire from Texas has wrought
political havoc and the official biographer of the nation's last
actor-president fesses up to fabricating an entire narrative
persona in his new book on Ronald Reagan, Beatty is hardly a
laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very responsible person, who has a genuine love for
the Democratic Party and has over 30 years of activism in the
Democratic Party,'' said Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. of Chicago, one of
a sizable group of disaffected politicos in both parties who have
welcomed Beatty's consideration of a campaign. ``But, like me, he
doesn't like the rightward drift of the party. Drifting to the
right is not the way Democrats win and make a difference in the
lives of average Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Beatty's old friend Stanley Sheinbaum, a liberal economist
and Democratic operative here, put it: ``He's a very serious guy
politically.''
</P>
<P>
   The occasion of all the fuss is Beatty's planned acceptance on
Wednesday of the annual Eleanor Roosevelt Award of the Southern
California Chapter of Americans for Democratic Action, a civil
liberties group that had long sought to honor him. It just happens
that Beatty's remarks at the dinner will amount to his most
extensive comments on a possible candidacy since Ms. Huffington
first publicly floated the idea in her syndicated column seven
weeks ago, and he elaborated in a terse and elliptical Op-Ed piece
in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Beatty declines to be interviewed for publication,
and insisted in an informal conversation the other day that he was
still unsure what he intended to say. He has told friends and
supporters that he does not flatter himself that the frisson that
has greeted his possible candidacy reflects anything other than the
power of his celebrity to shine light on a segment of thinking in
the Democratic Party that has remained largely unexpressed since
President Clinton successfully co-opted Republican themes in his
re-election strategy of ``triangulation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He always felt there was a candidate he could support in the
Democratic Party, and he no longer feels that way,'' said Frank
Mankiewicz, Robert F. Kennedy's former press secretary and a
longtime friend of Beatty's. The two Democratic contenders, Vice
President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, are ``nibbling
around the edges,'' Mankiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a Beatty candidacy came up in July at a dinner party
at Ms. Huffington's attended by Beatty and his wife, Annette
Bening.
</P>
<P>
   When other guests begin musing on the civic disconnection in
contemporary American life, someone suggested who better to tackle
that problem than J. Billington Bulworth himself. In that film,
released last year, Beatty plays a burned out senator so sick of
mouthing poll-tested platitudes that he takes a contract on his own
life, then is suddenly freed to tell the truth about political
cynicism, corporate greed, racial inequities and the state of
American democracy.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, Ms. Huffington made the musing public, and
since then, Beatty has drawn supportive words from Washington
public interest groups and politicians of all stripes. Ms.
Huffington introduced him to Bill Hillsman, the media man for Gov.
Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, who flew out for a consultation.
</P>
<P>
   Both wings of the Reform Party have sounded him out (he says
he's not interested), and John Burton, the old-line San Francisco
liberal who leads the California state Senate has made noises about
endorsing a Beatty candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   With the Republican maverick Pat Buchanan poised to bolt to the
Reform Party, Ms. Huffington said the need for someone like Beatty
to offer an opposing voice is all the greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a professional storyteller,'' Ms. Huffington said.
``We've become so atomized and candidates are just addressing
pocketbook issues. All the candidates are talking about prosperity
and nobody really does talk about the public good, about justice
and sacrifice, all those big things that we haven't heard since
John F. Kennedy. And the need for someone to do that, for someone
who can pull the nation around the fire and draw us together as
we're being pulled apart, is all the more important with the
presence of Buchanan, whom I consider very dangerous and don't
underestimate at all.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Perversely, or perhaps predictably, Beatty's potential candidacy
is greeted far more skeptically in Hollywood than in Washington.
Here his rivals grouse _ under cover of anonymity _ that Beatty is
trying to distract attention from his next movie, ``Town and
Country,'' the story of a man in a midlife crisis, about which the
early buzz is bad. They say that he is a charming but politically
unsophisticated control freak who, at 62 with an apparently
blissful marriage and a fourth child on the way, could never stand
the invasive strain of a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's taken less seriously in Hollywood than anywhere
else, because people know him,'' said one colleague of Beatty in
the film industry who admires his work and did not want to be
quoted by name. ``Because people know him, and if they know
anything, it's that he's phenomenally self-protective, risk-averse,
and indecisive. He wants to be wooed, he doesn't really want to
woo. I think he's flirting with this idea in the way that he's
flirted with hundreds of movies that he's ultimately not committed
to.''
</P>
<P>
   But, even this person adds, ``There has never been anyone more
charming.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty has put himself on the line politically before, giving up
an entire year to raise money and campaign for George McGovern for
president in 1972, managing to get Art Garfunkel and Paul Simon to
set aside their feud for a McGovern fund-raiser. But friends say he
has usually been more comfortable behind the scenes, even in the
movies, preferring to work as director and producer and amassing a
fortune through canny business dealings. In the 1970s resisted
entreaties to run for governor of California despite promising
polls.
</P>
<P>
   He declined interviews altogether for most of the period between
``Shampoo'' in 1975 and ``Bugsy,'' in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren is the maestro of his own movements,'' said Caddell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is certainly not making the case that he has some unique
experience or qualification to run for president,'' Caddell said.
``He is saying there are very important things that are not being
said, and people have come to him because they think he might be
heard. I think that his real strength is to be a vehicle for people
who think they can have no impact, and can't be heard. In a sense,
that's a candidacy, not a candidate.''

INDONESIA SHAKEN BY `BALIGATE' BANKING SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In the streets of Jakarta, students lob
firebombs at police. In the ruins of East Timor, Indonesian
soldiers seethe as foreign troops take over. In the desolate scrub
of Ambon, Christians and Muslims kill each other with home-made
guns.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of issues to anger today's Indonesia _ a
country suspended uneasily between dictatorship and democracy,
economic ruin and recovery. Yet of all the outrages in Indonesia
these days, the one that rankles people here most is a financial
scandal known throughout the country as Baligate.
</P>
<P>
   The facts of the case are simple: Bank Bali, one of Indonesia's
largest banks, paid nearly $70 million to the ruling Golkar Party
to help recover loans it was owed by other banks. The money was to
be funneled into the reelection campaign of President B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   Since the scandal came to light in July, the money has been
returned and a raft of investigations begun. Yet the public outrage
has become more thunderous by the day.
</P>
<P>
   With evidence emerging that other banks may have been asked to
participate in similar schemes, the Parliament on Friday demanded
that Habibie suspend seven top officials, including the finance
minister and the governor of the central bank, who it says were
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This scandal is the straw that broke the camel's back,'' said
Mark Baird, the World Bank's country director in Indonesia. ``It's
indicative of the much bigger political and economic stakes in
Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has yet accused Habibie himself. But after three
scandal-scarred decades under his predecessor, Suharto, people here
are in no mood to let an unpopular president off the hook. The
scandal _ and the government's obdurate response to it _ has become
a touchstone for those who say Indonesia must shed its culture of
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really fed up,'' said Rizal Ramli, an economist
here. ``After watching Habibie make so many speeches about the rule
of law, they realize the laws are not being upheld. Despite his
claims of being different, this government is merely an extension
of the Suharto government.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts here said that the scandal had grievously
wounded Habibie, who faces a tough election in November. But the
stakes are even greater: Some worry that Baligate could jeopardize
Indonesia's recovery and transition to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to elect a new president and not resolve Bank
Bali, I think all of these political changes would be at risk
because you fundamentally haven't changed the culture,'' Baird
said.
</P>
<P>
   Anoop Singh, deputy director of the International Monetary
Fund's Asia-Pacific operations, said the IMF could not ``just put
this aside and move on with the program without fully resolving the
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank have
backed up their words by withholding almost $1.4 billion in loans
to Indonesia until the country releases results of an outside
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The longer Jakarta refuses, the higher the cost: by the end of
next March, these agencies are scheduled to lend $4.7 billion to
Indonesia _ more than 10 percent of their total $43 billion rescue
package.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian officials say they can make do for a while. But they
agree that the country cannot fully recover from its economic
trauma without a resumption of foreign aid. ``In this budget year,
we need $10 billion in external aid,'' said Umar Juoro, an adviser
to Habibie. ``If they stop the support permanently, it would be a
disaster for the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   That Indonesia would risk such a disaster shows how difficult it
is for the country to change. Despite demands that the government
get to the bottom of things, it has refused to release a lengthy
report on the scandal assembled by the accounting firm
PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   People who have seen the report said that it named at least
seven senior officials as being directly involved in a scheme to
divert nearly $70 million from Bank Bali to the Golkar Party. They
also said that the report tracked the flow of money from
Indonesia's Bank Restructuring Agency, which had nationalized Bank
Bali, into a web of accounts held by people with ties to Golkar.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The State Audit Board, which received the PricewaterhouseCoopers
report, first urged the firm to release it. But threatened with
lawsuits by the people named in the report, the board backed off.
Now, it says, bank secrecy laws prevent disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In protecting all these people, it is true that I might be
protecting guilty people,'' Satrio Budihardjo Joedono, the Audit
Board chairman, said. ``But let the police decide, let the lawyers
decide. This is a question of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Joedono said he had given the report to the police, and hoped
that the right people would be prosecuted. He shook his head,
exasperated.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting corruption in Indonesia is not easy, he said,
especially when the culprits are well financed. He hinted that it
could also be dangerous: ``There are people walking around with
millions. That can buy a lot of lawyers and a lot of guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the people worried by the scandal is the man who started
it: the former president of Bank Bali, Rudy Ramli.
</P>
<P>
   Ramli, who is 41 and no relation to the economist, moved his
family to Singapore and ducked out of sight after the scandal
broke. He emerged two weeks ago to testify at a hearing in
Parliament _ a pale shadow of his once-ebullient self.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal is the sad denouement of Ramli's desperate struggle
to hold onto a bank he inherited from his father. The elder Ramli,
an ethnic Chinese businessman, bought the company in 1967; its name
derives from its roots on the resort island of Bali.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Under Rudy Ramli, Bank Bali grew into Indonesia's fourth-largest
private bank. It specialized in consumer banking and won the
respect of securities analysts with its relatively conservative
loan portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bank Bali was thought of as a good bank, and Rudy Ramli was
viewed as an honest banker,'' said Mark Hansen, a consultant who
specializes in banking at Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   But like all Indonesian banks, Bank Bali was devastated by the
Asian financial crisis. The devaluation of the Indonesian rupiah
left most of its corporate clients insolvent, which meant they
could not repay loans. And an outbreak of violent unrest in Jakarta
and other cities caused panicky bank runs.
</P>
<P>
   Ramli found himself in a race against time. Unless he could
quickly raise millions of dollars, Bank Bali would fail to meet the
government's capital-adequacy standards. Under Indonesia's
agreement with the IMF, the state would either take over the bank
or shut it down.
</P>
<P>
   At a companywide meeting, Ramli vowed to do whatever it took to
keep the bank afloat. ``If everybody is going to die,'' Ramli said
in an interview here last year, ``we want to be the last ones to
die.''
</P>
<P>
   He focused on more than $100 million that Bank Bali was owed by
three banks that had been closed. Under Indonesia's bank
restructuring laws, the government guaranteed the debts of all
banks, which meant Bank Bali should have been able to recoup the
money.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramli kept running into walls when he pleaded his case at
Indonesia's Central Bank and the Bank Restructuring Agency. In
desperation, he turned to a finance company, PT Era Giat Prima,
headed by the deputy treasurer of Habibie's Golkar Party, Setya
Novanto.
</P>
<P>
   The finance company helped Bank Bali recover the loans _ but
extracted a 60 percent commission, roughly $70 million. Novanto
described it as a debt-collection fee. Habibie's rivals in Golkar
said that the money was earmarked to buy votes in November's
presidential election, a charge that Novanto denies.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal was blown open in July by a consultant and gadfly,
who had obtained documents about the arrangement. Overnight,
Ramli's Faustian bargain threatened virtually every senior finance
official in Indonesia. Among those who have been accused of knowing
about the deal were Finance Minister Bambang Subianto; the governor
of the central bank, Syharil Sabirin; State Enterprises Minister
Tanri Abeng, and one of Habibie's closest advisers, Arnold
Baramuli.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure, the government hired PricewaterhouseCoopers in
August to investigate. Despite having only two weeks and poor
access to information, the firm said it uncovered ``numerous
indicators of fraud, noncompliance, irregularity, misappropriation,
undue preferential treatment, concealment, bribery and
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   At Joedono's request, PricewaterhouseCoopers issued an abridged
version that omitted more specific allegations about involvement by
senior officials. That report was circulated to members of
Parliament; a copy was obtained by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Even without naming names, the abridged report paints a vivid
picture of how officials used Indonesia's bank restructuring
program as a lever to extract payments from Bank Bali. It describes
how Ramli's requests for help were rejected by regulators, and then
suddenly granted after meetings between Bank Bali officials,
regulators, and Habibie's advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before Parliament, John Campbell, the
PricewaterhouseCoopers partner who wrote the report, said
regulators had approached 12 other banks about cutting similar
deals.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the way the bank restructuring was organized,
regulators had access to vast pools of money to rescue some banks
and not others. Such a setup, Campbell said, had created a ``high
internal and external vulnerability to fraud and misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing Campbell, Indonesia's Parliament demanded that
Habibie suspend the finance minister, central bank governor, state
enterprise minister and his adviser, Baramuli, as well as four
other officials. But Habibie said he would wait for a legal verdict
before dismissing anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Such statements give little comfort to the IMF and other
agencies. Indonesia's legal system is notoriously ineffectual.
Critics say that a prosecution of the Bank Bali case would founder
as surely as an investigation of former Suharto's ill-gotten wealth
has.
</P>
<P>
   Most officials have maintained silence, refusing to cooperate
with investigators or give interviews. Some have gone on the
offensive. Sabirin, the central bank governor, called the report
``absolutely wrong and unfounded'' in suggesting it gave
preferential treatment to Bank Bali. He has threatened legal action
against the firm.
</P>
<P>
   People here acknowledge that by the extravagant standards of
Indonesian corruption, a diversion of $70 million is peanuts. After
all, Suharto and his family are accused of siphoning billions.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bank Bali affair could have huge collateral damage
because it undermines Indonesia's efforts to rebuild its banking
system. With costs estimated at $40 billion to $60 billion, the
bailout is already one of the most expensive in history. Suspicions
that the process is corrupt could make it worse by scaring away
foreign banks that might have invested in banks here.
</P>
<P>
   After watching their country become a synonym for corruption,
taxpayers here are no longer willing to look the other way. That
may be why Bank Bali has aroused so much ire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officials who have responsibility for implementing the
program are themselves robbing the bank,'' Ramli, the economist,
said. ``It's a white-collar robbery by all the president's men.''

   County document copies destroyed by flood, but originals
salvaged
</P>
<P>

   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Hurricane Floyd flooded the basement of the
Robert Lee Humber House on Martin Luther King Drive, ruining
thousands of photocopied documents housed there by the state
archives.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the original documents, land records from counties
across eastern North Carolina, remain safe at their respective
county courthouses. The destroyed copies were in the process of
being microfilmed, something the state requires of local
governments, with the help of the Division of Archives and History.
</P>
<P>
   ``The microfilm was saved, but the counties will have to recopy
all those documents, and they're not going to be happy about that
at all,'' said Scott Power, supervisor of the Eastern North
Carolina Division of Archives and History, whose offices are in the
Humber House. ``But, it's a state law.''
</P>
<P>
   Also lost at the Humber House, built in 1895, were the oak
flooring and birch wood panelling in the basement. Power said the
foot of water that remained in the basement until last weekend
caused so much damage that all of the wood will have to be torn
out.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Greenville and Pitt County already had applied
for a state grant to address pre-storm decay at the home, including
the buckling porch and leaky windows. Power is hoping they will get
the grant and
</P>
<P>
   redirect the money toward the more pressing problems caused by
Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most well-preserved Colonial Revival
buildings we have here,'' Power said.
</P>
<P>
   All other books and documents on upper floors at the Humber
House remained untouched by the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone with important documents was so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Smith, head of preservation and conservation at East
Carolina University's Joyner Library, said she's talked to many
individuals and businesses coping with soaked books and papers. The
library, which itself suffered no damage, has a freeze-dryer that
can dry books and papers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got a group coming in to dry church records dating from
1800 to the present,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger problem than water is the mold it creates, Smith said.
Mold sometimes can be dried and scraped off, but sometimes it ruins
books.
</P>
<P>
   When a local business called Smith with 40 file cabinets' worth
of wet papers, she called Munter's Moisture Control. The company
will collect documents or books and send them to a large drying
center in Massachusetts, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   For information on drying books, photographs and documents, call
Elizabeth Smith at 328-0297.

GILLETTE PREDICTS 1 PERCENT DROP IN SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Gillette Co. said it expects its third-quarter sales to
fall 1 percent because of declining demand for some brands of
shavers and pens, problems it blamed on a strong dollar that hurts
its overseas results.
</P>
<P>
   For the same period a year ago Gillette reported revenue of
$2.53 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, coming three weeks before the company reports
earnings for three months ended Sept. 30, confirmed some concerns
on Wall Street that sales weren't on track at the Boston razor and
battery maker.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gillette said its earnings per share grew for the
quarter by 7 percent compared to the same period a year ago, when
it reported net income of $353 million before charges. For the
current quarter, the company said it still expects to report net
income of about 32 cents per share, in line with expectations of
analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
</P>
<P>
   Early warnings of troubles have become routine for Gillette,
whose stock this year has fallen from a high of $64.38 in March on
concerns about the company's profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette made its disclosures Tuesday after the close of
trading. Before the announcement, shares fell $1 to $37 apiece. The
update was ``certainly a disappointment,'' said Tony Vento, analyst
at Edward Jones in St. Louis. Vento is one of several analysts who
believes that Gillette should focus on its core businesses of
razors, Duracell batteries, and oral care products and consider
selling off its stationery and Braun appliance units.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point in time, Gillette has to ask themselves, `Do we
want to be in these businesses?','' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette's stationery line, which includes such brand names as
Paper Mate, Parker, and Waterman, saw sales fall from $924 milliion
to $856 million last year. In 1998, Braun sales were roughly flat
at $1.74 billion. Total 1998 sales for Gillette were just above $10
billion. Together razor and battery sales were about a little more
than $5.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Gillette says it can still restore growth to those business.
It said its latest sales revisions are due mainly to ``economic
softness and unfavorable exchange rates'' in Latin America and
Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   While its razors and batters traditionally sell well in those
areas, chairman and chief executive Michael C. Hawley said that
``Recently it has been difficult to achieve this success when
those...economies take major downturns.'' Excluding exchange-rate
issues, sales grew 3 percent during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Eric Kraus said Gillette was still able to support its
profit margins by cutting production costs at factories in South
Boston and in Berlin, Germany where it makes its Mach 3 razor.
</P>
<P>
   Kraus said Gillette also benefitted from growing sales of that
razor and of its Duracell batteries, products that carry higher
profit margins than do its lines of stationary and Braun electric
shavers.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by Zacks had expected Gillette would earn
$1.26 for the year ended Dec. 31. Kruas said the company was no
longer comfortable with those forecasts and said it expected to
offer more complete guidance when it releases its full results next
month.

AT PRAYER BREAKFAST, CLINTON TELLS OF A YEAR OF SPIRITUAL RECOVERY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seven months after a divided Senate found him not
guilty of impeachable offenses, President Clinton said Tuesday that
he continues to squeeze regular spiritual counseling into his
official schedule to recover from what he called ``one of the most
difficult years in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing somewhat reluctant to bring up the ghosts of the past,
the president told religious leaders at the annual White House
prayer breakfast that he was moved by the forgiveness shown to him
by members of his family and staff, the American people and God. A
year ago, with the Monica Lewinsky scandal in full furor, he used
the same forum for a tearful admission that he had sinned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to say only this about that: I have been
profoundly moved, as few people have, by the pure power of grace,
unmerited forgiveness through grace,'' Clinton said. ``Most of all
to my wife and daughter, but to the people I work with, to the
legions of American people and to the God in whom I believe, and I
am very grateful to all of you who have had any role in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton attended the breakfast but steered clear
of any mention of her husband's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   At the breakfast, held in the state dining room, the president
thanked the three spiritual counselors who have regularly met with
him since last fall: the Rev. J. Philip Wogaman, pastor of the
Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington; the Rev. Gordon
MacDonald of the Grace Chapel in Lexington, Mass.; and the Rev.
Tony Campolo of St. Davids, Pa., who runs ministries for the urban
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton decided to bring up the matter Tuesday because he was
speaking to the very group of religious leaders he had addressed so
personally last September, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been strange not to bring it up,'' explained a
White House official who talked to the president about his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   While portraying the counseling as a difficult process, Clinton
seemed a long way from the dark days of last fall when his
presidency hung in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the prayer breakfast last year, the House of
Representatives made public the Starr report detailing the
president's affair. ``I don't think there is a fancy way to say
that I have sinned,'' Clinton said then as details of the report
poured out on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will instruct my lawyers to mount a vigorous defense, using
all available appropriate arguments,'' the president had said,
foreshadowing the impeachment fight that ended Feb. 12 with
acquittal in the Senate. ``But legal language must not obscure the
fact that I have done wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's discussion of his spiritual journey was the latest
twist in a case that has from the outset blended the personal with
the political.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the breakfast, Wogaman said the president
has fit the counseling sessions in between official engagements,
taking an occasional break from the nation's business to focus on
himself. Without revealing details, Wogaman said Clinton has
completed readings and engaged in detailed, personal conversations.
</P>
<P>
   His pastoral advisers have said previously that they would study
Scripture with him and advise him to seek psychological counseling
or other treatment if they determined he needed it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the counseling was interesting and rewarding but
``not always comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you will pray for us'' as the process continues, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal comments drew qualified praise from some of
the lawmakers who had sought his ouster on charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Christian, I always try to remember what the Bible tells
me,'' said Rep. James E. Rogan, a Republican from California and
member of the House Judiciary Committee. ``It tells me to worry
about the demon in my own eye.''

 &HT;    Shelters phase down as more people leave
 &HT;    By Eunice Moscoso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Pitt County emergency shelters continued to
decompress Tuesday as more residents moved back into previously
flooded homes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the American Red Cross planned to close the shelter
at Stokes Elementary School on Tuesday or today, said Lou Kavanau,
a Red Cross volunteer at the county's Emergency Operation Center.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 10 people were living at the shelter and will be moved
to other locations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The shelter at Farmville Middle School is also getting less
crowded, with 23 people as of Tuesday, but no decision has been
made to close it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers at Pitt County's seven shelters have dropped from more
than 3,000 at the peak of the crisis to about 700.
</P>
<P>
   At Bethel Elementary, the number of shelter residents dropped
from 373 late last week to 141 Tuesday. Shelters at Ayden Middle
School and Ayden-Grifton High School are housing about 140 people
each and Ayden Elementary still has 117.
</P>
<P>
   At Wellcome Middle School, where 63 people remained living in
the gymnasium, Paola Andrades sat on a mattress with her
two-year-old daughter Kenya _ both left homeless by the wrath of
Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``She keeps asking me why we don't go home. I don't know how to
tell her that our home is gone,'' Andrades said, in Spanish, as her
daughter played with a few other children also living in the gym.
</P>
<P>
   Andrades and her husband lived in a trailer that completely
flooded and has been condemned, she said. They had no insurance.
``I'm not sure what to do. I guess we just have to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   But Andrades and her family can't wait there for too long. Next
week, cots and mattresses might be replaced by basketballs and jump
ropes as most local schools plan to reopen for classes.
</P>
<P>
   Kavanau said the Red Cross is working with state officials to
find new locations for temporary shelters before the schools open.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's in the planning stage right now. There will be an
alternative,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first of hundreds of campers state officials requested to
serve as temporary homes arrived at a site on County Home Road
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   County and city officials urged displaced residents to apply for
federal assistance, which could include temporary housing. Those
seeking aid should call the Federal Emergency Management Agency's
toll-free number _ (800) 462-9029 or (800) 462-7585 for the hearing
and speech impaired. FEMA has also opened a disaster recovery
center for those who want more information about the various aid
programs. It is not necessary to visit the center to get federal
help.
</P>
<P>
   Through the federal aid programs, some hurricane victims could
qualify for rental assistance or for temporary housing in hotels,
but that could prove difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a hotel room available in Greenville,'' said John
Gasper, a Red Cross volunteer and coordinator for the Pitt County
Red Cross Family Service Center.

NO JOBS AT RISK, ATLANTIC'S NEW OWNER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The changing of the guard at The Atlantic Monthly
magazine became official when new owner David Bradley visited the
troops Tuesday. But his message to staffers, clearly shaken by the
suddenness of the sale, was a very soothing one: Stay the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the instant I arrived, people were welling up with
tears,'' said Bradley, 46, recounting the emotional staff meeting
in which he tried to calm frayed nerves. ``The things that animate
them at the center also animate me. The North Star I'd like to set
for this group is the one they've had for 140 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're all tremendously reassured. He's clearly a
thoughtful, serious, decent human being,'' said senior editor Jack
Beatty. ``He seemed to understand what we were feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Washington-based National Journal Group of
government-oriented publications, Bradley bought the Atlantic from
developer and media magnate Mort Zuckerman. The hastily announced
deal, which became public on Monday, caught many staffers by
surprise and prompted feverish speculation regarding Bradley's
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   The early word from Bradley and new Atlantic editor Michael
Kelly, however, is that there are no plans to move the magazine
from Boston, no plans to change the editorial philosophy, and no
plans for a major staffing overhaul, other than the decision to
replace editor William Whitworth with Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of them is at risk of their jobs,'' said Bradley. ``We're
asking them all to stay on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great magazine. I approach it first from a real sense
of awe,'' added Kelly, who was also headed for Boston Tuesday.
``The identity of The Atlantic Monthly is deeply rooted, and I am
not looking to come in there and uproot that identity or subvert
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic _ with its long essays, global range, and esoteric
commentary _ has carved out a reputation as a kind of antidote to
today's sound-bite-driven media culture. With a circulation of
about 460,000, it has a loyal following as well as critics who
believe it is too hidebound and too detached from the events of the
day. Widely believed to be losing money, it has benefited from
Zuckerman's commitment to invest in the product.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what advice he might have for the new owner, former
Atlantic editor Robert Manning said: ``I got a little bit more to
the cutting edge, a little closer to the currents. I'm sure he's
got plans to get more vigorous.''
</P>
<P>
   One conceivable scenario would be for Kelly, 42, to inject more
politics and policy into the Atlantic mix. Kelly, who has edited
the National Journal for about a year, is also a syndicated
columnist and vocal Bill Clinton critic. He had a brief stint as
editor of The New Republic, but he was dismissed by owner Martin
Peretz, who claimed Kelly had taken the magazine too far to the
right.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, however, Kelly was adamant that he
would not ``take this magazine and turn it into a different
creation, a creature of the Beltway or an ideological magazine or a
magazine devoted to politics. . . . This is primarily a magazine of
ideas and literary journalism. . . . Its standards are not about
buzz, its standards are about excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no thoughts here of doing anything radical with the
staff, the contributing writers, or the editorial operation,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The one major change announced thus far is the decision to
replace the 62-year-old Whitworth, who came to the Atlantic when
Zuckerman purchased it in 1980. ``We're not reassured that Bill, of
all people, is leaving,'' said Beatty. ``That's the hard part.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sure (Bradley) would bring in his own guy,'' said
Whitworth. But ``I was surprised at how quickly the decision was
made.'' At dinner with Bradley on Monday night, Whitworth asked
whether that decison reflected the new owner's dissatisfaction with
the Atlantic. Bradley responded that it wasn't a matter of fixing
the magazine, but that he and Kelly had dreamed of running a
general interest magazine together.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he will accept Zuckerman's offer of a new position
elsewhere in his media empire, Whitworth said that ``my first
reaction to him is that I would rather have a very modest
retirement than a fancy new job.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the positive feeling engendered by Bradley's debut in
Boston Tuesday, few observers believe that the new regime is
indefinitely and irrevocably committed to preserving the status
quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said all the right things . . . about respect for the
traditions of the magazine,'' noted Whitworth. ``I think we're all
just taking them at their word. Obviously, things change.''

 &HT;    Mrs. Gore visits flooded churches
 &HT;    By Gene Metrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ Tipper Gore came to Rocky Mount Tuesday to
help kick off a clean-up campaign for flood-damaged churches.
</P>
<P>
   Gore visited with members of the Metropolitan Baptist Church,
who were being assisted in their clean-up work by volunteers from
the Church of the Good Shepherd in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me you have it all together here,'' the wife of
Vice President Al Gore said. ``The thing that makes life worth
living is not only the celebration of good times, but also being
there for each other in times of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort is part of the N.C. Department of Crime Control and
Public Safety's ``Church2Church'' clean-up program, which matches
churches from undamaged parts of the state with those in flooded
areas to help restore and rebuild their damaged houses of worship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government is a tool that must be used to the utmost where it
can to help people in their time of need,'' Gore said. ``But we all
know that government can not ever hope to replace the love and
embrace of someone helping to clean out your sanctuary.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four feet of water had cascaded into the church, tossing
the sanctuary lectern, organ, pews and a piano through the
building. The Rev. Raymond Privott, pastor of the church, estimated
the damages at $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came in here Saturday, the pews had been ripped
up from the force of the water,'' he said. ``But lying on top of
the pulpit, still dry and open, was the Bible that had sat there
for 34 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the midst of all the turmoil and running water, it was a
sight to see - it was amazing, a true miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Robert Sawyer, pastor of the Church of the Good
Shepherd, said members of his congregation had also pledged to
donate $10,000 to help the clean-up and restoration efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also pledged to work for increased assistance in providing
counseling for flood victims, saying the mental trauma suffered by
flood victims would continue to be suffered long after physical
damages have been repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Privott said the ``Church2Church'' assistance was ``one of the
warmest things to come out of this disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts into practice that what we have been teaching in our
church - that there is good in man,'' he said. ``It means new life
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also visited families living in FEMA trailers at a
relocation site in Fountain Industrial Park.

FILENE'S BASEMENT TO SHUT DOWN 17 STORES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Filene's Basement Corp., the Wellesley retail chain
that filed for bankruptcy protection last month after some vendors
stopped shipping it merchandise, said Tuesday it plans to close 17
underperforming stores over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the closings could ``impact'' the jobs of 400
full-time and 600 part-time employees who work at those stores. The
Filene's Basement chain has 3,800 employees.
</P>
<P>
   If the closings are approved by the US Bankruptcy Court in
Boston, Filene's Basement could end the year with 40 stores, 15
fewer than when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
late August.
</P>
<P>
   Filene's Basement's famous flagship store in Boston's Downtown
Crossing is not affected by the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Because most store closings are in suburban locations, it seems
Filene's Basement wants to retrench its namesake stores in urban
markets and use its new Aisle 3 chain to woo suburbanites.
</P>
<P>
   Closing underperforming stores is pretty much standard procedure
for a retailer in Chapter 11, a sort of amputation of gangrenous
extremities designed to save the life of the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Filene's Basement, which has been hurt by fierce competition and
changes in consumer shopping habits, had earlier announced plans to
close two other stores, neither in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 19 stores we have identified for closing represent
approximately 20 percent of our total sales revenue and a
disproportionate level of losses for the company,'' said chairman
and chief executive Sam Gerson in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Filene's Basement lost $9.5 million on sales of
$588.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remaining core of Basement stores meets the company's
strategic objectives in terms of merchandising, market position,
and revenue and profitability potential,'' Gerson said.
</P>
<P>
   The closings suggest that Filene's Basement appeals largely to
an urban customer who's still willing to invest some time in
hunting for bargains on designer clothes. Filene's Basement may
have less appeal for busy suburbanites who want stores they can get
in and out of as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to attract suburban customers, the company has been
testing a new store concept called Aisle 3, a warehouse store that
opens for business only on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the company operates four Aisle 3 stores, with plans
to soon open four more in the suburbs of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   By Dec. 31, the company expects to have 32 Filene's Basement
stores in largely urban markets and eight Aisle 3 stores in
suburban locations, company spokeswoman Carreen Winters said.
</P>
<P>
   After filing for bankruptcy protection, some retailers opt to
close unprofitable stores in phases, but Filene's Basement decided
to close its underperforming stores all at once, Winters suggested.
There are no plans at this time to close additional stores, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company, the proposed store closings have the
support of the company's unsecured creditors. As a general rule,
bankruptcy courts approve a retailer's store closing plan that has
the support of most creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever possible, full-time employees affected by store
closings will be offered transfers to other stores, Filene's
Basement said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees who are not transferred will be offered severance
packages and outplacement assistance, the company said.

CONGRESS VOWS TO PASS INTERIM SPENDING MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIM WEINER  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Unable to pass its appropriations bills before the
new fiscal year begins on Friday, Congress resolved on Tuesday to
keep federal agencies functioning for three weeks while Republicans
negotiate with President Clinton over hundreds of billions of
dollars of spending.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the stop-gap spending measure, called a continuing
resolution, has become a nearly annual event. Congress has met the
fiscal deadline only four times in the past 22 years. But this
year, the stakes are higher.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders vowed repeatedly to pass the spending bills
on time, keep them within spending limits Congress imposed in 1997,
and abstain from spending surplus Social Security money to run
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The first of those promises is now broken. The second will be
broken soon, according to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. And
the third _ the pledge to keep Congress' hands off Social Security
_ is very much in doubt, even though the House on Tuesday passed,
by a 417-2 vote, a non-binding resolution vowing not to spend the
retirement money.
</P>
<P>
   After that vote, Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., one of the staunchest
fiscal conservatives in the Republican ranks, said it was still
possible to keep Congress from spending Social Security surpluses.
``We have a strategy,'' Coburn said. ``We're working on it. We
don't know if it's going to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who routinely spent surplus Social Security money to
run government operations during most of the years from 1955
through 1994 when they controlled the House, where spending bills
originate, ridiculed the non-binding resolution, though almost all
of them voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt compared it to ``saying
we're going to quit smoking while we're having a cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   Debate on the continuing spending resolution was short and
occasionally bitter. Republicans said little as Democrats chided
them for the failure to pass the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., the ranking minority member on the
House Appropriations Committee, said the Republicans' rhetoric
about spending and Social Security was a form of fiction designed
to delude the American people. ``If it isn't a public lie, it is
the largest fib I have seen in a long time,'' Obey said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., the chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, who has worked hard but unsuccessfully
this year to keep the spending bills from being mired in politics,
said, ``Sometimes I wish that this were fiction, but it is not.''
</P>
<P>
   The continuing resolution passed the House by a 421-2 vote and
immediately went to the Senate, which approved it, 98-1, after an
equally desultory debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the years I've been here,'' said Senate Minority Leader
Tom Daschle, ``I don't recall a time when there's been greater
appropriations disarray than there is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Republican Congress and the White House must spend the
three weeks covered by the continuing resolution in the political
equivalent of hand-to-hand combat, fighting over how to spend
roughly half a trillion dollars of public money.
</P>
<P>
   As the continuing resolution was sent to Clinton, senior
Republicans in the House and Senate sought ways to find billions of
dollars to finance spending bills without tapping into Social
Security money.
</P>
<P>
   They still plan to take back $3 billion in welfare money from
the states, even though the nation's 50 governors _ 31 of whom are
Republicans _ oppose the idea and say Republican leaders promised
them this year that they would not touch the money. ``Congress is
breaking the commitment it made,'' the National Governors'
Association said on Tuesday in a letter to House leaders.
</P>
<P>
   And House Majority Leader Dick Armey said Congress could recoup
$8 billion by changing the way it pays out the earned-income tax
credit. He said the money could be saved by meting out this federal
tax break for working-class wage-earners in monthly payments
instead of in an annual lump sum.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Senate and House negotiators wrangled over a Pentagon
spending bill of nearly $270 billion, with Lott working to convince
the House to finance construction of a $1.5 billion ship in his
home state.
</P>
<P>
   Congress sent a measure financing energy and water projects to
the White House, completing work on the fifth of its 13 spending
bills this year. And Clinton issued the first of seven vetoes he
and his advisers have threatened against those bills, rejecting a
$4.7 billion measure financing federal operations in the District
of Columbia, saying Republican amendments to the bill violated the
principle of home rule for the capital. &QL;

 &HT;    Mrs. Gore visits flooded churches
 &HT;    (EDS: Corrects to Telegram in tagline.)
 &HT;    By Gene Metrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ Tipper Gore came to Rocky Mount Tuesday to
help kick off a clean-up campaign for flood-damaged churches.
</P>
<P>
   Gore visited with members of the Metropolitan Baptist Church,
who were being assisted in their clean-up work by volunteers from
the Church of the Good Shepherd in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me you have it all together here,'' the wife of
Vice President Al Gore said. ``The thing that makes life worth
living is not only the celebration of good times, but also being
there for each other in times of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort is part of the N.C. Department of Crime Control and
Public Safety's ``Church2Church'' clean-up program, which matches
churches from undamaged parts of the state with those in flooded
areas to help restore and rebuild their damaged houses of worship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government is a tool that must be used to the utmost where it
can to help people in their time of need,'' Gore said. ``But we all
know that government can not ever hope to replace the love and
embrace of someone helping to clean out your sanctuary.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four feet of water had cascaded into the church, tossing
the sanctuary lectern, organ, pews and a piano through the
building. The Rev. Raymond Privott, pastor of the church, estimated
the damages at $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came in here Saturday, the pews had been ripped
up from the force of the water,'' he said. ``But lying on top of
the pulpit, still dry and open, was the Bible that had sat there
for 34 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the midst of all the turmoil and running water, it was a
sight to see - it was amazing, a true miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Robert Sawyer, pastor of the Church of the Good
Shepherd, said members of his congregation had also pledged to
donate $10,000 to help the clean-up and restoration efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also pledged to work for increased assistance in providing
counseling for flood victims, saying the mental trauma suffered by
flood victims would continue to be suffered long after physical
damages have been repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Privott said the ``Church2Church'' assistance was ``one of the
warmest things to come out of this disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts into practice that what we have been teaching in our
church - that there is good in man,'' he said. ``It means new life
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also visited families living in FEMA trailers at a
relocation site in Fountain Industrial Park.

JUSTICE GINSBURG'S CANCER WAS DISCOVERED AT EARLY STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The colon cancer diagnosed in Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg has apparently not spread, and was discovered at an early
stage by accident because the justice suffered symptoms from an
unrelated abdominal infection, the Supreme Court announced on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 66-year-old justice went home from Washington Hospital
Center on Tuesday, 11 days after surgeons removed her sigmoid
colon, a two-foot length of bowel that comprises the lower third of
the large intestine. Doctors have classified her cancer as being in
the second of four stages; about 75 percent of Stage Two colon
cancer patients are cured, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The justice is very lucky to have had this picked up
incidentally,'' said Dr. Harmon Eyre, chief medical officer for the
American Cancer Society in Atlanta. ``If it had been left alone it
would have advanced to another stage.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, the court's public information officer,
Kathleen Arberg, said a small tumor, measuring about two by three
centimeters, had invaded the justice's colon and entered the outer
muscle but did not penetrate through it. Subsequent tests showed no
evidence that the disease had spread to the lymph nodes or any
other organ.
</P>
<P>
   The tests results are a good sign, Eyre said, but they are no
guarantee. In some patients, ``there can be microscopic spread''
that does not turn up in early biopsies.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsberg became ill this summer while teaching in a law school
program on the Greek Island of Crete. Doctors at first thought she
had acute diverticulitis, a disorder of the large intestine, but
later diagnosed colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it turns out, the diverticulitis diagnosis may have been
correct after all; according to Ms. Arberg's statement, Dr. Lee
Smith, the surgeon at Washington Hospital Center who performed the
operation on Sept. 17 on Ginsburg, also discovered a perforation
higher in her bowel. The perforation, which was not malignant,
caused her abdominal infection.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her hospitalization, Ginsburg has been participating in
the court's recent work, although whether she has been involved by
telephone, written memo or in some other way was unclear. The court
on Tuesday issued a list of nine cases that it intends to hear this
term; there was no announcement that Ginsberg was absent, as is
customary when justices do not take part in deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Eyre said most patients in Ginsburg's condition need at least a
month to six weeks to recuperate from surgery, possibly longer in
her case if there are complications from the perforated bowel. She
should heal completely, he said, without any need for a colostomy,
and may not need any chemotherapy or radiation. Doctors should make
that determination after evaluating samples of her cancerous
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The justice should be monitored closely from now on for any
evidence of a recurrence. That typically includes an annual
colonoscopy, in which doctors use a lighted scope to examine the
length of the colon, as well as periodic blood tests.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cancer of the colon and rectum is the second leading cause of
cancer deaths in the United States, after lung cancer. It is also
one of the most curable of cancers, but only if it is found in the
early stages. Although many women think of colorectal cancer as a
man's disease, that is not the case. Ginsburg is among 67,000 women
_ 4,600 more women than men _ who will have the disease diagnosed
in the United States this year, according to the American Cancer
Society.
</P>
<P>
   Because colon cancer develops slowly and has a long precancerous
stage, it is easily prevented. A tumor the size of Ginsburg's, for
instance, might take about two to three years to develop, Eyre
said, and might take three to five years before causing any
symptoms. But by that time, the disease would be more advanced, and
much more difficult to treat. The cancer society recommends regular
colon cancer screening for women and men, 50 and older.

 &HT;    Tobacco industry picking up pieces after flood
 &HT;    By Tom Murphy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ The reopening of the Rocky Mount Tobacco
Market on a rainy Tuesday was one sign of recovery from Hurricane
Floyd's devastation.
</P>
<P>
   A record high of $1.88 a pound was paid by buyers at Raynor and
Peoples warehouses. Tuesday was the first sales day for the local
market since Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were selling mostly leaf tobacco,'' said R.J. Raynor, owner
of Raynor Warehouse. ``The tobacco we sold today was cured before
the hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials estimate agricultural losses due to Floyd will
exceed $1 billion. The government is talking about loans. But
farmers say they can't pay back what they've got.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of agricultural destruction overall,'' Raynor
said. ``A lot of tobacco still in the fields was blown off the
stalk. Damage also was heavy to peanut, cotton and sweet potato
crops. Farmers have been through a devastating two weeks. We don't
need this additional rainfall. We need to dry out.''
</P>
<P>
   Raynor Warehouse sold 330,571 pounds of tobacco for $603,125.63
for an average of $182.45 per hundredweight. Stabilization received
62,701 pounds - 19 percent of the day's offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd and flood damage has extended the sales season, Raynor
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a week of sales because of the hurricane,'' he said.
``All the markets were closed from Florida to Virginia. We have
about four more weeks left in this marketing season.''
</P>
<P>
   Bart Wood, floor manager at Peoples Warehouse,, said the
majority of tobacco sold at his warehouse Tuesday came from the
packhouse or had been on the warehouse flood prior to Floyd's
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the tobacco sold had been here since Sept. 13,'' he
said. ``It was good quality tobacco. As a whole, farmers were
pretty well pleased with what happened today. They were glad no
more went to Stabilization than did (16,411 pounds or 8.6 percent
of the day's offerings). It had been upwards of 28 to 30 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood said the remainder of a number of tobacco crops in the
Battleboro, Scotland Neck and Pinetops area drowned because of
flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples Warehouse sold 190,538 pounds of tobacco for $350,527.58
for an average of $183.97 per hundred pounds.

THE SKINNY ON WB'S NEW `POPULAR'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By DAVID KRONKE 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ If there's one media outlet that has no business
lecturing us on body image, it's the WB. And yet, amid the torrents
of svelte, youthful comeliness that gush forth from the network's
airwaves comes the shrill, small and staggeringly hypocritical
voice of ``Popular,'' a new series that considers itself daring
because it has a couple of cast members who don't look anorexic and
suggests _ stop the presses! _ that the whole idea of teen cliques
is arbitrary and probably unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this same show forces its gorgeous characters to dig deep
into their psyches in a neurotic search for flaws, physical or
otherwise; acceptance of or simple neutrality toward oneself is
utterly verboten. And its chief conceit is that the ``unpopular''
girl (played by Carly Pope) is just as attractive _ and smarter,
and even a smidgen more introspective _ as the ``popular'' one
(Leslie Bibb), but, well, she's still an outcast. This results in
behavior all around that is borderline pathological.
</P>
<P>
   What is this show going to do for the self-esteem of
impressionable, average-looking young viewers _ who, God willing,
will just tune into the infinitely smarter ``Freaks and Geeks''
instead _ wondering what their chances for social acceptance are if
even good-looking kids get shunned? ``Popular'' wants it both ways
_ it lures viewers in by promising them glimpses of Bibb in a slip,
then tries to assuage them by intimating that her character's a
harridan because she won't hang out with ``normal'' kids.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just one of the many sins of ``Popular,'' which
debuts tonight and continues in its regular time slot on Thursday.
``Popular'' proves only that people who live in Hollywood long
enough can lose all touch with reality. Co-creator Ryan Murphy
writes, for one of his characters to declare, ``We live in the Age
of Gwyneth (Paltrow) and that is the state by which all things are
judged,'' distilling the theme of the series to its essence.
</P>
<P>
   Show business is just high school with money, Martin Mull once
observed; in ``Popular,'' high school is just show business,
period, and if the rest of the country can't relate, well, they're
not cool anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy used to write for Us magazine (Pope's character, Sam,
writes for the school newspaper); now he has his own weekly
incarnation of that magazine's ``Who's Hot-Who's Not'' issues. He
tries, unconvincingly, to present both points of view. ``We're all
just trying to make it through the day hoping no one finds out
about us _ we're the same,'' Sam reflects.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke (Bibb), the cheerleader, may be superficial, but she's a
sincere kind of superficial, and the jock (Bryce Johnson) is
actually soulful underneath _ he aspires to perform in the school
musical. On the other hand, a couple of in-crowd kids (played by
Tammy Lynn Michaels and Leslie Grossman) would have to add layers
of personality simply to come off as one-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
   If the kids' characterizations defy credibility, the adults are
simply risible. Teachers argue over their dominion of the popular
kids, or they bully students for having a point of view, and the
jock's pop marches into the high-school auditorium and interrupts a
rehearsal to bawl out his kid for getting a part in the play _ in
other words, for achieving.

   In Thursday's episode, Sam's mom and Brooke's dad get engaged
without the girls having even realized they were an item. The plot
twist ensures that these separate cliques will be in each other's
faces for the duration of the series, but as strained contrivances
go, it's pretty breathtaking.

<P>
   Actress Sara Rue has a scene in the second episode where she
movingly discusses her weight problem. It would be a powerful
moment on any other show. Here, she's inspired to do so by the fact
she didn't make the cheerleading squad because, implausibly and
manipulatively, the school allowed two popular girls to control the
vote. Here, among scenes of partying and shopping for designer
fashions and copious soon-to-be-dated pop-culture references, it's
an egregiously insincere gesture. ``Popular'' is a trollop of a TV
show, desperately willing to do anything _ anything _ to get people
to like it.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The show: ``Popular.'' &QL; 
What: Comedy-drama about who's hot and who's not at an upscale high
school.  &QL; 
Who: Carly Pope, Leslie Bibb, Tammy Lynn Michaels, Bryce Johnson,
Tamara Mello, Christopher Gorham. &QL; 
Where: WB (Channel 5). &QL; 
When: Debuts at 9 tonight, then moving to its regular 8 p.m.
Thursday time slot the following night. &QL;

   `WORK WITH ME'
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Pollak is a funny comic who does a wicked William Shatner
impersonation, so it's a modern tragedy that he plays a lawyer _
that is, someone whose career is not predicated on riffing on
Shatner _ in his new sitcom, ``Work With Me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a pretty flimsy premise _ Jordan Better (Pollak) doesn't
get the big promotion he expected at his stuffily prestigious
corporate firm, so he quits in a huff and signs up with wife
Julie's (Nancy Travis) teeny crusading law office. The nutty
complication is that their assistants (Emily Rutherfurd and Ethan
Embry, who apparently have been ordered under threat of death to
break out as zany characters like Megan Mullally and Sean Hayes of
``Will and Grace'') are trying to hide their relationship from
Jordan and Julie.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot's plot is so routine it has to have been a mistake:
Apoplectically jealous Jordan suspects a handsome client of being
interested in Julie. The jokes lack zip, and for playing a married
couple, Pollak and Travis have zero chemistry. Whenever they
embrace, it looks like each is trying to avoid a sexual harassment
suit from the other. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The show: ``Work With Me.'' &QL; 
What: Sitcom about husband-and-wife lawyers going into practice
together. &QL; 
Who: Kevin Pollak, Nancy Travis. &QL; 
Where: CBS (Channel 2). &QL; 
When: 8:30 tonight. &QL; 
Our rating: 2 stars &QL;

AUDIT REVEALS NEED FOR `OVERHAUL' AT REGISTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL REZENDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Already reeling from a barrage of criticism by citizens
and state lawmakers, the Registry of Motor Vehicles came under
additional fire Tuesday as State Auditor Joseph DeNucci released a
stinging interim audit and called for ``a complete overhaul'' of
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   In a soup-to-nuts critique of Registry operations, DeNucci said
Registry customers sometimes wait more than three hours for
service, Registry employees have awarded themselves pay raises and
promotions with little or no oversight, and Registry personnel have
failed to monitor sales tax collections by the state's auto
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Registry's failure to properly monitor sales tax
collections is troubling, and consumers have a right to be
frustrated by the poor service they have received,'' DeNucci said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, officials working for DeNucci said the audit,
underway for the last year, is continuing and is likely to produce
additional criticism of the Registry's use of consultants,
renovations of registry facilities and purchases of goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, newly named Registrar Daniel A. Grabauskas said he met
with DeNucci last week to discuss the audit and plans to use it as
a blueprint for revamping the agency. ``I'm all about change, and
if there's something that needs changing, I'm the agent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Grabauskas, on the job only six days, also said he hasn't
had time to determine whether solving the agency's problems will
require additional staff or a larger budget.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci, reponding to the audit, refused to
acknowledge that Registry operations have deteriorated during
nearly a decade of Republican management, citing the elimination of
some Registry fees and the opening of ``express offices'' on
Saturdays as improvements.
</P>
<P>
   But DeNucci said poor management is at the root of problems
besetting the agency. For instance, after noting that Registry
customers sometimes wait more than three hours, DeNucci said top
Registry officials lack ``a comprehensive recognition of the
staffing needs and managerial changes necessary to correct problems
that result in lengthly and unneccesary delays to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Poor management and a lack of oversight were also cited in the
cases of seven Registry employees who received unauthorized pay
raises or promotions, or were hired in violation of union
agreements. The audit places the cost of ``personnel
irregularities'' made during spot checks at $78,086.
</P>
<P>
   And the poor management refrain continued in the audit's finding
that Registry officials are failing to monitor state sales tax
collections by auto dealers. In some cases, the audit said, the
state is losing money. In others, customers are overcharged.

COURT TO HEAR BROOKLYN MUSEUM CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The clash between Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the
Brooklyn Museum of Art is headed to federal court in what could be
a landmark First Amendment case.
</P>
<P>
   For a week now, the mayor has threatened to cut off city funding
to the museum if it proceeds with a show called ``Sensation,''
slated to start Saturday, which includes art works that he
considers ``disgusting'' and ``anti-Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has voiced particular outrage over a painting of the
Virgin Mary surrounded by clumps of elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   Talks to explore a compromise broke down Tuesday. At that point,
the museum's board voted to go ahead with the show and filed a
lawsuit, asking a federal judge to block the city from taking any
action against the museum.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the city is filing its own lawsuit, charging the
Brooklyn Museum with violating its lease and calling for the
eviction of the museum's director and board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   The board's chairman, investment banker Robert S. Rubin, put the
suit in its loftiest context, saying it was being filed not just
for the Brooklyn Museum but ``in the interest of all public
institutions _ museums, universities, and libraries _ that are
dedicated to the free exchange of ideas and information.''
</P>
<P>
   The board's vote was unanimous, except for one dissent _ by
deputy mayor Joseph Lhota, who attended the meeting on Giuliani's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   City Hall's top lawyer, Michael Hess, who also attended the
meeting, said afterward, ``Because this board insisted on defying
everybody, we will be cutting off funding'' beginning Friday, when
the next monthly subsidy check is scheduled to go out.
</P>
<P>
   As with many other cultural institutions, the city owns the
Brooklyn Museum's building and pays $7 million a year _ about
one-third of its operating budget _ for heat, electricity, security
guards, and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Hess repeated a point that Giuliani has made recently: ``There
is nothing in the constitution that says taxpayers should pay for
an exhibition like this.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Floyd Abrams, the prominent First Amendment lawyer who
is representing the museum in this suit, countered, ``There's no
obligation for the city to fund the arts at all,'' but cited
several court cases ruling that once a city government goes down
that road, the First Amendment prevents it from stopping the money
for reasons having to do with the art's content.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, before Abrams was hired by the museum, he said
in an interview that the dispute ``could be a landmark case'' if it
went to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's aides had also argued in the past few days that the
museum _ by barring children under 17 from attending the show
without being accompanied by an adult _ was violating its lease
with the city. The lease, signed over 100 years ago, requires the
museum to open its exhibits to schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's board maneuvered around this potential legal
obstacle Tuesday by voting simply to rescind the restriction.
Warning signs will be posted throughout the museum, but children
will not be forbidden to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breach of lease is no longer a live issue,'' Abrams noted.
``There should be no further talk from the mayor's camp about
leases. This is now purely a First Amendment issue.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in a phone interview, Lhota said the lease also
prohibits the museum from charging admission for an exhibit without
the mayor's permission. ``They're charging admission for this
exhibit, the mayor has not given his permission, so we will take
them to court for violating their lease,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Rubin had met with City Hall officials to discuss
possible compromises. In one scenario, the museum would remove the
Virgin Mary painting and move a few other offending works to
another area _ in exchange for which the city would cut only a
portion of its subsidy and only for the three months that the show
is scheduled to run.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams, when told of this new argument, sighed and said, ``This
is just another frivolous arguement designed to avoid the
inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   However, museum officials denied any such compromise had been
offered or approved. By the time of the formal board meeting
Tuesday, the deal _ if there had ever been one _ was taken off the
table.

TREASURY PRICES FALL SHARPLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The prices of Treasury securities fell sharply
Tuesday, raising the yield on the long bond to its highest level in
several days and representing the sharpest one-day rise in over two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted a variety of factors contributing to the bearish
tone and selloff, including selling by funds and dealers, supply,
technical factors and a surge in the prices of gold and other
commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Even weakness in the Dow Jones industrial stock average, which
was down more than 200 points at one point in the day, was unable
to provide much sustained support. Traders also suggested that the
supply of new debt had a hand in downward price pressures. Buying
was limited as dealers set up hedges in advance of Fannie Mae's
$5.3 billion bond sale.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to attracting investors away from Treasury
securities, government bonds can also fall during large debt sales
because dealers often sell their most liquid assets, like
Treasuries, as a hedge against losses should the market take a
downturn before the deal is completed and the debt is distributed
to investors.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year Treasury fell a full point Tuesday, to 100 19/32,
while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to
6.08 percent, from 6.01 percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The two-part issue from Fannie Mae, the nation's largest buyer
of home loans, drew enough demand so that Fannie Mae was able to
increase its planned sale by more than 30 percent. The five-year
notes were priced to yield about 59 basis points more than a
Treasury security with a similar maturity and the 30-year bond was
priced to yield more than 81 basis points over the government bond.
A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Antonellis, market strategist for Briefing.com in
Burlingame, Calif., said Tuesday's Treasury market was driven by
factors that included the surge in gold prices, which affected the
longer maturities, as well as rumors of hedge-fund selling on the
long end of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Other metals, in addition to gold, also climbed, stoking
investor fears that rising prices would also increase inflation and
force the Fed into action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was decent bid to the front end, or shorter maturities
in the market due to the weakness in stocks, as investors put a
premium on shorter issues,'' Antonellis said. ``But the flight to
quality today has not been enough to keep the bond market in
positive territory because the market has been burned on so many
occasions this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury plans to sell $15 billion of new two-year notes
Tuesday. In when-issued trading late Tuesday, the notes were
offered at a price to yield 5.61 percent.

CONGRESS LEANING TOWARD HIKE IN MINIMUM WAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time since revamping the welfare
system, Congress appears ready to approve a significant increase in
the minimum wage, potentially affecting millions of low-income
employees who until recently did not have jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals, which would add $1 to the $5.15 minimum wage over
a two- to five-year period, have drawn objections from Republicans
and small business owners who say an increase causes low-wage jobs
to disappear. But the opposition is relatively mild, and Republican
leaders in both the House and Senate seem unwilling to wage a
fierce battle to kill the legislation, especially with so many
other issues in Congress unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Observers said the Republican about-face is startling. Only
three years ago, House Majority Leader Richard Armey of Texas said
he would permit a minimum wage increase ``over my dead body.'' But
even after a rollicking news conference on Capitol Hill Tuesday _
featuring Hillary Rodham Clinton, Senator Edward M. Kennedy and a
series of charts attempting to prove the necessity of an increase _
few Republicans appeared interested in turning the minimum wage
issue into an ordeal. Armey, at a simultaneous news conference, did
not mention it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate has changed dramatically,'' said Rick Berman,
executive director of the Employment Policy Institute, a
Washington-based think tank that is funded by businesses and is
opposed to a minimum wage hike. ``I'm baffled by it. My guess is
that the Republicans, without enough of a margin in Congress, don't
see it as a fight worth making, even though the economics don't
make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The main proposal in the Senate would increase the minimum wage
by $1 over two years, and is almost identical to the last wage
increase in 1996, which boosted the minimum wage from $4.25 to
$5.15.
</P>
<P>
   Last time, Kennedy immobilized the Senate while pushing for the
increase and the House passed the 90-cent hike in the face of
overwhelming opposition from Republican leaders. House Majority
Whip Tom DeLay of Texas reacted in horror to the 1996 vote, saying
the Democratic Party ``is to job creation what Jack Kevorkian is to
health care.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Kennedy has threatened to shut down the Senate again,
saying he will try to attach a minimum wage amendment to any piece
of legislation that comes to the floor. But Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott indicated this week that such guerrilla tactics may not
be necessary. When Kennedy asked him when the minimum wage could be
debated, Lott invited him to his office to ``sit down and seriously
discuss a way to get this done.''
</P>
<P>
   In the House, some Republican opponents seem to be avoiding a
strategy of killing the bill outright. Instead, minimum wage
legislation is being viewed as a vehicle for accomplishing other
GOP goals, with some Republicans pushing to combine a minimum wage
increase with a package of tax cuts, aides said. Those cuts would
be aimed at small businesses most affected by a minimum wage
increase but also could include the elimination of estate taxes and
a deduction for health care.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the bill is hardly unanimous, said Trent Duffy, a
spokesman for House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer,
a Republican from Texas. ``Some conservatives will never vote for a
minimum wage increase because they just fundamentally believe in a
thing called supply and demand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the addition of tax cuts would make the increase more
appealing to moderates and even some conservative Republicans, who
are primarily concerned that jobs would be lost if the minimum wage
goes up, he said. ``The feeling is that if you attach some tax
relief to reduce the impact of the threat of that, then you might
be able to have enough conservatives vote for it,'' Duffy said.
``That's the theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Rick A. Lazio, a Republican from New York, is
expected to roll out his minimum wage proposal this week, complete
with proposals for tax cuts. Archer's own bill will be unveiled
before the session ends next month, Duffy said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans also expressed support for a proposal that
would allow states to ``opt out'' of the federal minimum wage
requirements. The bipartisan bill would not let states drop their
minimum wage lower than the current $5.15 an hour, but it would
give state legislatures the right to ignore any future increases.
Representative Charles W. Stenholm, the Texas Democrat and
co-sponsor of that bill, said it would ``give states greater
flexibility to develop appropriate strategies to respond'' to
citizens' needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sit back and look at the real world out there, we're in
an internationally competitive marketplace,'' Stenholm said. ``And
anything we do that decreases our competitiveness is going to have
a depressing effect on jobs. I think we must be very careful before
we increase the minimum wage without providing some flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But Representative David E. Bonior, joining Clinton and Kennedy
at Tuesday's news conference, made it clear most Democrats would
fight such a proposal. ``That's like saying all drivers have to
stop at a stoplight unless they opt out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is considering a run for the Senate from New York,
said the increase would serve as a cost of living adjustment for
the poor, restoring the value of the minimum wage to what it was in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not asking for special favors for these millions and
millions of people, who do a lot of the work that keeps this
country going,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy drew the most applause, pointing to a recent
congressional pay increase as evidence the Republican Congress
would be hypocritical by not debating the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Read the record. No opposition to increasing their own wages _
$4,600 in one year,'' Kennedy said. ``We do not believe that who
anyone who wants to work, who will work, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks
of the year, should have to live in poverty in America. This, above
all, is a fairness issue. And the American people understand
fairness.''

 &HT;    New York encephalitis virus may head south
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Migrating birds may have brought an
encephalitis-causing virus never before seen in the Western
Hemisphere to New York, where the virus has killed four people and
sickened at least 37 others.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists are concerned birds carrying the virus may bring
it farther south as they migrate to warmer climates for the winter.
Georgia public health officials say they aren't worried because the
human outbreak has been confined to New York, and it's unclear
whether the virus would pose a threat to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows which birds carry the virus, which is similar to
the West Nile virus of Africa. Humans are infected through
mosquitoes that have fed from the blood of infected birds.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its human victims, the virus has felled scores of
birds in New York and Connecticut _ mostly crows, but also a few
flamingos and an Asian pheasant at the Bronx Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal animal host for a virus doesn't die from carrying it,
however. The ideal host remains alive so the virus can be passed on
to other species.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we have some more details about what the bird is and we
can look at migratory directions, all we can do is take the normal
precautions that anyone can do with encephalitis,'' said Tom
Bennett, an environmental health specialist with the Georgia
Department of Human Resources.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has
sent at least six researchers to New York. Researchers at the CDC's
labs in Fort Collins, Colo., identified the virus and are
conducting further studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be some time before we know how long this virus has
been around or where it came from,'' said agency spokesman Tom
Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   Since late August, more than three dozen people in New York City
and the neighboring counties of Westchester and Nassau have been
stricken with encephalitis caused by the West Nile-like virus.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are analyzing blood from another eight New Yorkers who
died since August to determine whether they were killed by the same
strain. About 170 cases of illness remain under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the CDC identified the culprit as St. Louis
encephalitis virus, the most common cause of epidemic encephalitis
in the United States. Late Friday, the agency changed its diagnosis
to West Nile-like virus.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate solution is the same in either case: Kill the
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to note that all the control measures in New
York and surrounding states are appropriate whether St. Louis or
West Nile-like virus is involved,'' Skinner said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia doesn't have statewide mosquito control measures, but
many coastal counties do, Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   No human or avian cases of encephalitis have been reported this
year in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain, caused by anything
from head injury to bacterial or viral infections. Most people with
encephalitis suffer flu-like symptoms, including fever and
headaches. In some cases, the infection leads to paralysis,
seizures, coma and death. Young children, the elderly and those
with weak immune systems are at greatest risk.
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus was first identified in 1937 in Uganda. West
Nile encephalitis has been reported in Africa, Europe and Asia.

<P>
   West Nile encephalitis cannot be passed from person to person,
or from birds to people; the virus must pass through a mosquito. No
vaccine exists for the virus, and treatment is limited to the
symptoms of the illness.

ELECTRIC COOKER MAKES A COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
Runs with SLOWCOOKER-RECIPES 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The slow cooker, that electric all-in-one cooking
dish, popularized and trademarked by the Rival Co. as the Crock-Pot
in 1971, has become a lasting trend.
</P>
<P>
   While the pots _ since then made under different brand names _
have had their ups and downs over the last 20-some years _ they're
back in favor and at home in the kitchen these days. And cooks
aren't embarrassed to admit they use them _ and often.
</P>
<P>
   Some have pulled them from the back of closet shelves and dusted
them off, while others have jumped on the slow-cooking bandwagon
for the first time. It's no wonder. You can turn out a variety of
versatile and interesting creations with ease and convenience.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lori Baker, home economist for Rival in Kansas
City, Mo., after a lull in the '80s, people are going back to the
slow cooker. ``The company has seen yearly increases in sales _
single- or double-digit _ since the early '90s. And we anticipate
overall sales increases again this year. We estimate last year that
about 7 million slow cookers of all types and brands were sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got busier and busier as a nation as so many more women
with children were working, and the Crock-Pot was a great appliance
to add convenience and prepare economical, home-cooked meals,''
said Baker. Also, Rival developed and released more fashionable
colors and designs in the early '90s _ and cooks started to buy a
second slow cooker. Rival was selling to more than just first-time
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Today Rival offers round-shaped pots in 1- to 6-quart sizes and
oval pots in 3 1/2-, 4 1/2- and 5 1/2-quart sizes. ``People really
went crazy over the oval-shaped pots when they were introduced in
1996,'' said Baker, adding ``they're nice for large roasts, turkey
breasts, ribs and more.''
</P>
<P>
   Rival's latest innovation on the theme is the Crock-Pot Duet,
which is being introduced in selected department stores next month.
The 5 1/2-quart oval pot has a divided stoneware insert with a
permanent stoneware wall or divider that splits the pot into two
separate compartments, one with about two-thirds of the total
capacity, the other with one-third. It is designed to offer cooks
flexibility and save them from buying two pots.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you can cook a vegetable or rice or dessert on the
smaller side and cook meat, soup or chili on the large side. ``We
prepared and served jambalaya with rice at a recent (housewares)
show, and everyone loved it,'' said Baker. ``Although it has a
single lid, we haven't experienced any mingling of flavors in our
extensive recipe testing.''
</P>
<P>
   You can start various recipes _ using your favorites, or those
that come with the pot _ at the same or different times. During
testing of the pot, many consumers said they would prepare the same
basic recipe but with different spices (i.e. with and without
onions to appeal to their kids).
</P>
<P>
   Although some cooks are requesting healthier, low-fat recipes _
and Rival has, in response, produced ``Easy Low-Fat Cuisine,'' with
45 recipes, each with less than 15 grams fat per serving,
(available for $9.95 by calling 800-557-4825), Baker believes that
most people who use the pot on a regular basis aren't concerned
about lowering fat.
</P>
<P>
   If your vision of slow-cooker dishes in the past has been of
gray and unappealing food that has been cooked for hours, be aware
that these days timing is critical for appealing chicken,
appetizers, rice, desserts and drinks. Not all foods should be
cooked eight, 10 or 12 hours, so pick recipes to fit in with your
schedule. An extra hour or two will ruin some dishes. For instance,
most chicken recipes take only 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be alarmed if slow-cooker recipes call for a larger amount
of spices than usual _ or they appear to be too thick when cooking
begins. Herbs and spices fade with slow cooking _ and mixtures
become more liquid with condensation and accumulation of moisture
in the pot.
</P>
<P>
   Kristi Fuller, a cookbook editor for Better Homes and Gardens
Books, who was responsible for editing ``New Flavors From Your
Crockery Cooker,'' which came out last year, believes the
ever-increasing interest in slow cooking is related to the pot
being so easy to use. In many cases, you can toss everything in and
walk away until dinner time. ``This is an appliance that doesn't
really go out of style, because people appreciate the
convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's recipes are designed to use a continuous slow cooker,
which has heating coils or elements wrapped around the sides of the
cooker and remains on continuously _ and which is preferred by most
cooks. Intermittent cookers, which have the heating element or coil
located beneath the food container and cycle on and off during
operation are not recommended, as they tend to cook food less
evenly and sometimes even burn it.
</P>
<P>
   This new volume has freshened up the recipes and ingredients _
and expanded them beyond traditional boundaries. Many recipes take
you globe-trotting _ Thai Chicken Soup, Beef and Chipotle Burritos,
Persian-Style Stew, to name a few _ and have a fusion of flavors.
Recipes also showcase the pot's versatility. Who would have thought
you could make Raspberry Fudgy Brownies or Caramel-Pear Pudding
Cake in it?
</P>
<P>
   Put your slow cooker to work with one of these recipes. You're
in for some good eating without a hassle. &QL;

`INVISIBLE' CONDOM UNDER DEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Someday a woman will be able pick up a tube of gel or cream at
her local pharmacy that not only protects her from getting
pregnant, but also against HIV and other sexually transmitted
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The products, which would be applied before sex, would be cheap,
over-the-counter, safe, easy to use, and unnoticeable during sex.
Called microbicides, they would be like ``invisible'' condoms, and
could be used by women whose partners refuse to use condoms.
Ideally, some would protect a woman from disease but still allow
her to become pregnant if she chose. Unfortunately, it may be a
decade before the new products come to market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once developed, this may even be better than the condom,''
said Dr. Arthur Chen, director of the AIDS Prevention and Research
Center at National Yang Ming University in Taipei. ``It's always
difficult to persuade the partner. Vulnerable groups in society
need an invention developed for them to prevent HIV,'' Chen said.
In Taiwan, two-thirds of the women who become HIV-infected are
spouses or girlfriends of HIV-infected men, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the substances researchers are working with are
derivatives of drugs that are already used against HIV, such as
AZT, or of other anti-viral and anti-bacterial drugs. One of the
most promising of these types of products is being designed at a
Cambridge-based company, Procept Inc.
</P>
<P>
   At a reproductive medicine conference in Toronto, researchers
this week revealed the latest developments in the new class of
STD-blockers. About 56 different approaches are being tried, mainly
by research institutions and small start-up companies.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, sexually-active women represent the fastest growing
portion of the HIV/AIDS population, with an estimated 13.8 million
women infected with HIV, and 85 percent of those are of
reproductive age, said Osmond D'Cruz, director of reproductive
biology at the Hughes Institute in St. Paul, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   In one study, supported by the National Institutes of Child
Health and Human Development (NICHD), D'Cruz and his colleagues
found that a derivative compound of AZT, called ZDV, which is
already known to be effective at both controlling HIV transmission
and preventing pregancy, can also work as a vaginal gel or cream.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the work in this field is, like D'Cruz's work, only
about a decade old, and still in the early stages.
</P>
<P>
   Movement has been slow, said Polly Harrison, director of the
Alliance For Microbicide Development, because there's been ``not
enough money, focus, coordination and speed.'' ``Many (projects)
are still stuck in pre-clinical stages,'' said Harrison. ``What's
causing the clogging is that big pharmaceutical companies don't
want to play yet, so we don't see the money devoted to this. That
means we have to depend on the federal government, which isn't
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Penny Hitchcock of the sexually transmitted diseases branch
of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases said
her organization's first priority has been to evaluate currently
available spermicides. But after being tested in large numbers of
humans, the spermicides haven't shown much success as microbicides,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most promising of the microbicides is being developed
by Procept. Called Pro 2000, Procept's lead anti-infective product
is a colorless, odorless gel that is a contraceptive and an
antimicrobial barrier against herpes, HIV and chlamydia. Unlike
some spermicides, the gel doesn't irritate vaginal tissues, said
Procept Vice President Albert Profy.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Procept started an expanded safety trial of its
product with sexually active women and HIV-positive women in four
cities, Profy asid.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Max Essex, professor of virology and chairman of the Harvard
AIDS Institute, believes that the biggest problem is that
microbicides may not be able to accommodate women who want to
conceive while being protected from disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these women really want to get pregnant. I find it
hard to imagine that it will be very possible to make a vaginal
microbicide that kills HIV, but doesn't kill or damage sperm,''
Essex said.

TV'S SABRINA CHANNELS ENERGY INTO ROMANTIC COMEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VAL KUKLENSKI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Melissa Joan Hart says when she was 4, she wanted
to become an actress so she could hear her own name on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I wanted to be on `Romper Room' because I really wanted
my name said in the Magic Mirror, and I knew there was no way to do
that unless I was on the show because she would not say Melissa,''
Hart said. ``So I figured if I was on the show there's no way she
could get around it _ she'd have to say my name.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she hears her name all the time _ Melissa, star of
``Sabrina, the Teenage Witch'' on ABC; Melissa, co-star of the
network's new kid show, ``Sabrina, the Animated Series''; and now
Melissa, star of ``Drive Me Crazy,'' a romantic comedy hitting
theaters Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And there are behind-the-scenes beckonings as well: Melissa, an
executive producer of the prime-time series; Melissa, a partner
with her mother, Paula, in Hartbreak Films; Melissa, the big sister
and mentor to seven siblings, all of whom have worked in the
business.
</P>
<P>
   These days the 23-year-old former star of the Nickelodeon series
``Clarissa Explains It All'' is spread thinner than fat-free cream
cheese on a supermodel's Melba toast.
</P>
<P>
   She's bouncing between coasts to promote the movie, wedging in
press interviews between talk show appearances while her publicist
keeps a close eye on the itinerary and his watch. She fights back
yawns of fatigue and reminds herself that she needs to telephone a
professor at New York University this week to ask for a year's
leave of absence from her bachelor of arts correspondence program.
She'd love to keep up the studies, but there just isn't time.
</P>
<P>
   The degree in progress, begun in January 1994, is not precisely
defined yet _ ``some kind of combination of art and literature,''
Hart says, rattling off a wide range of classes she already has
completed. When will she graduate?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping in the next four or five years,'' she says,
sounding uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   All of you who have complained about plodding through school on
the five-year plan while working part time: Quit whining.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Hart says Melissa is very hands-on as vice president of
Hartbreak, keeping involved with 43 projects in development and
using her celebrity stature to open doors both with stars she would
like to cast and studio chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was little, she worked constantly,'' Paula said. ``I
found that when she was working, all of her school grades were
straight A. But when she would take a break, all her grades would
drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more pressure she has on her, the better she does. She's
one of those Type A personalities, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, about the movie. Originally titled ``Next to You,'' ``Drive
Me Crazy'' centers on Nicole (Hart), a fun-loving high school
senior intent on saving face with the popular crowd after the
school basketball star jilts her. Her neighbor, Chase (Adrian
Grenier), is a social outcast by choice who wants to get back
together with his girlfriend, and agrees to ``date'' Nicole to make
their exes jealous and win them back.
</P>
<P>
   Hart says the fact that Grenier and she are so different _ he's
the quiet, keep-'em-guessing counterpoint to her high-energy
effervescence _ was a big plus during the shoot. (Despite a
well-publicized ``thing'' they had during filming, she did not
mention Grenier or any other man when pressed about her love life.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very much like our characters, and yet we get along very
much like our characters,'' she said. ``We really have a great
relationship because we're very open to listening to the other
person about what their opinions are, about what their views are on
something. We really respect each other, basically, is where it all
comes from. We respect that we kind of come from similar places but
take different approaches to things.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually explains it a lot better than I do,'' she adds
with a touch of apology.
</P>
<P>
   The role, which calls for Hart to appear manipulative and, in
one long scene, smashed, represents a baby step toward playing
less-wholesome characters than Clarissa and Sabrina.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Hart is no Mama Rose aiming to keep her daughter in the
Dainty June costume as long as possible. In fact, she has been
propelling Melissa toward more sophisticated projects. In some
recent publicity photos, the actress turns down that high-wattage
smile for a more sultry look, camouflages her girlish freckles,
tousles her blond mane into bedroom hair and flaunts her navel
ring.
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, don't look for Melissa to plunge immediately into
deeper, darker waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many things I'd like to do, but I know I'm not
ready for them yet,'' Hart said. ``The next step for me would have
to be something a little bit more serious, but not too serious, not
melodramatic. A character that has dimension, that's real, that's
going through some kind of change, some challenge. It's hard to
say, but if I read it I'd know.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart enjoys nightclubbing and partying with close friends at her
Hollywood Hills home, but she remains mindful as ever of public
expectations of a celebrity branded as the girl-next-door type.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are in the public eye, there is certain
responsibility,'' she said. ``You have to walk a fine line about
how far do you go with your own life and then how far do you take
the role model thing. When do you start to do your own thing and
just live your own life?''
</P>
<P>
   Hart reflected back to 1997 when, during her first season of
``Sabrina,'' she felt ill at ease playing some of the screwball
bits the scripts demanded. ``Now that's what I love is all the
over-the-top stuff. Maybe it's because I'm so comfortable now after
four years of working with the crew and I know everybody so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ever tried to do anything serious in front of those
people they'd laugh at me. They just know how goofy I am, and we
all have so much fun being idiots together.''
</P>
<P>
   Really, she says, her ``Sabrina'' friends would be very
supportive of any endeavor. ``But I just feel stupid acting in
front of them. If anyone could see right through it, it would be
them.'' A pause. ``So maybe it would be good to do it in front of
them because it would put me to the test, make me work my
hardest.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Former football great charged with fraud; settlement announced
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (f) Financial and (s) Sports categories.)
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hall of Fame football star and businessman Fran A.
Tarkenton was charged by the government on Tuesday with carrying
out a multi-million dollar financial fraud scheme as chief
executive of KnowledgeWare, a one-time Atlanta software company.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission
announced a settlement of the case under which Tarkenton agreed to
a pay a $100,000 fine and disgorge $54,187 in incentive
compensation he had been paid.
</P>
<P>
   The money will go to federal court, and former shareholders of
the company might make claims to it.
</P>
<P>
   Tarkenton and six other former KnowledgeWare executives agreed
to the settlement without admiting or denying the charges.
Tarkenton could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney issued a statement saying that ``Mr. Tarkenton is
pleased to have this matter resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC alleged that Tarkenton and the six other executives of
KnowledgeWare. ``materially inflated'' the company's reported
earnings in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Tarkenton, 59, was chairman and chief executive officer of
KnowledgeWare at the time.
</P>
<P>
   An SEC said it's not unusual for a settlement of this kind to
take five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all, KnowledgeWare reported at least $8 million in revenue
from sham software sales,'' the SEC said in its civil action, which
was part of a sweeping government move against 15 public companies.
</P>
<P>
   According to the SEC complaint, KnowledgeWare engaged in fraud
when it ``parked'' its products with resellers and other ``supposed
customers,'' who were given the right not to pay for the software.
</P>
<P>
   These rights were communicated to the clients orally or in
``side letters,'' which were kept separate from the company's other
sales documents reported to the government and to the public.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``parked'' inventory was booked as actual sales, which
the SEC said was a violation of company and professional accounting
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The parking of inventory was pervasive from the quarter ended
Sept. 30, 1993, through the rest of fiscal year ended June 30,
1994, according to the SEC. The agency said sales personnel issued
more than 50 ``side letters'' for ``phony sales'' ranging from
several thousand dollars to almost $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to the SEC, Tarkenton and other company executives
``directed this financial fraud scheme and each of the other
defendants knowingly played an importanmt role in implementing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint alleged arkenton ``personally instructed'' a vice
president to generate a phony $356,500 software sale to a reseller
shortly before the end of the third quarter of fiscal 1994, after
the intended user ``had declined to purchase the software that
quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospective end-user never purchased the software, and the
phony sale to the third party remained an account receivable on
KnowledgeWare's books for the rest of (fiscal year) 1994 without
any attempt at collection,'' the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott York, with the SEC's New York office, said Tuesday that
the agency's crackdown on KnowledgeWare and other companies was
intended to show that ``anyone who participates in this kind of
fraud will be held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not the work of a lone employee acting in
isolation,'' he said. ``Fraud pervaded KnowledgeWare because of the
management scheme to inflate revenue and earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The events in question took place about five or six years ago
during Mr. Tarkenton's tenure at KnowledgeWare, and he has long
since moved on with his life to other business ventures,''
Tarkenton's attorney, Robert Thornton of King &AMP; Spalding, wrote in
the statement. ``Mr. Tarkenton entered into this settlement without
admitting or denying any of the allegations of wrongdoing in the
complaint and without trial or adjudication of any legal or factual
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC case was not the first legal action against
KnowledgeWare. Several shareholder lawsuits grew out of the
acquisition of the company in 1994 by Dallas-based Sterling
Software.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota financier Irwin Jacobs and some associates sued
Tarkenton in January 1995, alleging he misled investors about the
financial condition of KnowledgeWare.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's complaint said KnowledgeWare experienced a shrinking
market as U.S. companies switched from mainframe computer programs,
its specialty, to software for networks and personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced a major restructuring in the third quarter
of 1993, took a $22 million charge against earnings and laid off 20
percent of its employees. The company reported a loss of more than
$25 million in fiscal 1993 on sales of $128 million.
</P>
<P>
   But in a meeting with analysts, Tarkenton and other executives
made upbeat projections about the following year, according to the
SEC.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said Tarkenton, Donald P. Addington, president and chief
operating officer, and Rick W. Gossett, chief financial officer,
``together with other defendants,'' engaged in a fraudulent scheme
to overstate revenue and earnings ``to give the false appearance
that KnowledgeWare had met or exceeded its projections for (fiscal
year) 1994.''
</P>
<P>
   The company announced in 1994 that it would be acquired by
Sterling Software in a deal reported at the time to be worth $143
million. A merger agreement was signed in August.
</P>
<P>
   But when KnowledgeWare announced that it expected to report a
loss for the June 30 quarter, Sterling Software withdrew its
original offer of $8.75 per share and instead offered just under $5
per share.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Software acquired the company at that price, which it
said in its annual report totaled $74.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company also set aside 20 percent of the purchase price at
the time to cover any shareholder lawsuits that might come out of
the acquisition, an amount totaling almost $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Kupp, vice president investor relations for Sterling
Software, said Tuesday that all of the money in that escrow fund
was subsequently paid out as a result of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   She emphasized that Sterling Software was not affected by the
SEC's complaint against the former KowledgeWare management.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Tarkenton, Addington, 48, and Gossett, 47, the
other executives named in the SEC complaint were Lee R. Fontaine,
34, manager of financial reporting; William E. Hammersla III, 45,
vice president for direct sales in the Northeastern U.S.; Eladio
Alvarez, 41, district sales manager in the company's direct sales
group; and Edward Welch, 55, district sales manager in the Reseller
Channel Sales group.
</P>
<P>
   All but Alvarez and Welch consented to the SEC's judgment and
agreed to pay civil fines varying from $100,000 for Addington to
$10,000 for Fontaine.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC also said it settled administrative proceedings aginst
four former KnowledgeWare sales executives charged with
participating in the financial scheme.
</P>
<P>
   They are Laura M. Drews, 35, a vice president; Stephen J. Pace,
39, vice president of direct sales for the Southern and Mid-Western
states; Robert S. Chamberlain, 41, vice pesident of direct sales in
the West; and Joseph A. Mathes, 38, a district manager.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said all four had settled the proceedings without
admitting or denying the Commission's findings. They were required
to disgorge ``excess incentive compensation'' in amounts from
$31,824 to $6,728.
</P>
<P>
   A star quarterback at the University of Georgia and Minnesota
Vikings, Tarkenton went into the software business in 1980, two
years after retiring from pro football.
</P>

ARIZONA GOVERNOR ENDORSES BUSH FOR PRESIDENT 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush raided Republican
presidential rival John McCain's home state Tuesday to pick up the
endorsement of Arizona Gov. Jane Hull.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a new poll indicates the GOP presidential
contest in Arizona will be a three-way battle between Bush, McCain,
the state's senior U.S. senator; and publisher Steve Forbes, who
won Arizona's 1996 presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Hull had been delaying endorsing a Republican presidential
candidate because there were two local residents in the contests:
McCain and former Vice President Dan Quayle, an Indiana native who
moved to Arizona a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Hull last Saturday told McCain she was going to throw her
support to Bush, even before Quayle announced Monday that he was
dropping out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing but the highest regard for John McCain,'' Hull
said at a Capitol news conference with Bush on Tuesday. ``This
isn't against John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull said she is supporting Bush because they share a vision on
lower taxes, less government and improving education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am throwing my support behind Governor Bush for several
compelling reasons. First of all is his character. Second is his
experience. And third is his vision of the future,'' Hull said.
``In baseball they call it a grand slam.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull became the 24th of 30 Republican governors to endorse Bush,
not counting the Texas governor himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called McCain _ a former Vietnam prisoner of war _ a
``legitimate hero.'' But Bush said he also plans to compete for
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to coming here to compete,'' Bush said. ``I
know I've got a lot of hands to shake, a lot of people I've got to
convince.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Bush announced his intention to seek the GOP
presidential nomination in March, his father, former President
Bush, hosted a fund-raiser for his eldest son in Arizona that
brought in more than $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush held a Phoenix fund-raiser himself Tuesday that was
expected to gather $100,000 for his campaign. When the campaign
finance deadline passes Thursday, Bush is expected to announce that
he has raised more than $50 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain has most Arizona elected officials backing him,
Hull's endorsement of Bush could serve as a psychological blow to
his campaign. McCain has been counting on scoring well against Bush
in New Hampshire and then in South Carolina and Arizona to
jump-start his campaign before the end of February 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain and Bush can remember how political endorsements did
not carry the state in 1996. McCain originally supported Texas Sen.
Phil Gramm for the Republican nomination. But after Gramm dropped
out, McCain and most other Arizona politicians threw their support
to Bob Dole, the party's eventual nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that support, Dole finished second to Forbes and only
slightly ahead of commentator Patrick Buchanan in the state's
primary.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll of Arizona voters conducted last weekend by KAET-TV
and Arizona State University found Bush leading in the state with
31 percent to McCain's 22 percent, followed by Forbes at 10
percent. Other candidates in the race had less than 10 percent
support each.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also picked up the endorsement of former House Republican
leader John Rhodes of Mesa, whom McCain replaced when Rhodes
retired. Rhodes said he believed Bush was more likely to win the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his wife, Laura, later visited the Thomas J. Pappas
Elementary School, a privately run school for about 700 homeless
children who live in temporary shelters, abandoned buildings and
condemned motels.
</P>
<P>
   Two fifth-graders, identified only as Nick and Brent,
interviewed the Bushes for a school radio station.
</P>
<P>
   The boys asked Laura Bush was it was like to be the wife of a
future president. Mrs. Bush told them that she has a wonderful
family and that as a former teacher she likes to make school visits
such as this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to encourage you all to work hard, study hard and turn
off the television at night and study,'' Mrs. Bush told the
homeless children.
</P>
<P>
   One of the boys threw a tougher question at Gov. Bush: ``If you
become president, can you help to see that there are not as many
guns or knives to hurt people?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he wanted to prosecute people who violate laws in
selling, carrying or using guns. He said he also wanted to keep
guns out of the hands of juveniles and the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   The boys also asked how he would stop abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, remind people they should abstain from sex
until they are married,'' Bush said.

 &HT;    Former football great charged with fraud; settlement announced
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (f) Financial and (s) Sports categories.)
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hall of Fame football star and businessman Fran A.
Tarkenton was charged by the government on Tuesday with carrying
out a multi-million dollar financial fraud scheme as chief
executive of KnowledgeWare, a one-time Atlanta software company.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission
announced a settlement of the case under which Tarkenton agreed to
a pay a $100,000 fine and disgorge $54,187 in incentive
compensation he had been paid.
</P>
<P>
   The money will go to federal court, and former shareholders of
the company might make claims to it.
</P>
<P>
   Tarkenton and six other former KnowledgeWare executives agreed
to the settlement without admiting or denying the charges.
Tarkenton could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney issued a statement saying that ``Mr. Tarkenton is
pleased to have this matter resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC alleged that Tarkenton and the six other executives of
KnowledgeWare. ``materially inflated'' the company's reported
earnings in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Tarkenton, 59, was chairman and chief executive officer of
KnowledgeWare at the time.
</P>
<P>
   An SEC said it's not unusual for a settlement of this kind to
take five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all, KnowledgeWare reported at least $8 million in revenue
from sham software sales,'' the SEC said in its civil action, which
was part of a sweeping government move against 15 public companies.
</P>
<P>
   According to the SEC complaint, KnowledgeWare engaged in fraud
when it ``parked'' its products with resellers and other ``supposed
customers,'' who were given the right not to pay for the software.
</P>
<P>
   These rights were communicated to the clients orally or in
``side letters,'' which were kept separate from the company's other
sales documents reported to the government and to the public.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``parked'' inventory was booked as actual sales, which
the SEC said was a violation of company and professional accounting
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The parking of inventory was pervasive from the quarter ended
Sept. 30, 1993, through the rest of fiscal year ended June 30,
1994, according to the SEC. The agency said sales personnel issued
more than 50 ``side letters'' for ``phony sales'' ranging from
several thousand dollars to almost $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to the SEC, Tarkenton and other company executives
``directed this financial fraud scheme and each of the other
defendants knowingly played an importanmt role in implementing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint alleged arkenton ``personally instructed'' a vice
president to generate a phony $356,500 software sale to a reseller
shortly before the end of the third quarter of fiscal 1994, after
the intended user ``had declined to purchase the software that
quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospective end-user never purchased the software, and the
phony sale to the third party remained an account receivable on
KnowledgeWare's books for the rest of (fiscal year) 1994 without
any attempt at collection,'' the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott York, with the SEC's New York office, said Tuesday that
the agency's crackdown on KnowledgeWare and other companies was
intended to show that ``anyone who participates in this kind of
fraud will be held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not the work of a lone employee acting in
isolation,'' he said. ``Fraud pervaded KnowledgeWare because of the
management scheme to inflate revenue and earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The events in question took place about five or six years ago
during Mr. Tarkenton's tenure at KnowledgeWare, and he has long
since moved on with his life to other business ventures,''
Tarkenton's attorney, Robert Thornton of King &AMP; Spalding, wrote in
the statement. ``Mr. Tarkenton entered into this settlement without
admitting or denying any of the allegations of wrongdoing in the
complaint and without trial or adjudication of any legal or factual
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC case was not the first legal action against
KnowledgeWare. Several shareholder lawsuits grew out of the
acquisition of the company in 1994 by Dallas-based Sterling
Software.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota financier Irwin Jacobs and some associates sued
Tarkenton in January 1995, alleging he misled investors about the
financial condition of KnowledgeWare.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's complaint said KnowledgeWare experienced a shrinking
market as U.S. companies switched from mainframe computer programs,
its specialty, to software for networks and personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced a major restructuring in the third quarter
of 1993, took a $22 million charge against earnings and laid off 20
percent of its employees. The company reported a loss of more than
$25 million in fiscal 1993 on sales of $128 million.
</P>
<P>
   But in a meeting with analysts, Tarkenton and other executives
made upbeat projections about the following year, according to the
SEC.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said Tarkenton, Donald P. Addington, president and chief
operating officer, and Rick W. Gossett, chief financial officer,
``together with other defendants,'' engaged in a fraudulent scheme
to overstate revenue and earnings ``to give the false appearance
that KnowledgeWare had met or exceeded its projections for (fiscal
year) 1994.''
</P>
<P>
   The company announced in 1994 that it would be acquired by
Sterling Software in a deal reported at the time to be worth $143
million. A merger agreement was signed in August.
</P>
<P>
   But when KnowledgeWare announced that it expected to report a
loss for the June 30 quarter, Sterling Software withdrew its
original offer of $8.75 per share and instead offered just under $5
per share.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Software acquired the company at that price, which it
said in its annual report totaled $74.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company also set aside 20 percent of the purchase price at
the time to cover any shareholder lawsuits that might come out of
the acquisition, an amount totaling almost $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Kupp, vice president investor relations for Sterling
Software, said Tuesday that all of the money in that escrow fund
was subsequently paid out as a result of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   She emphasized that Sterling Software was not affected by the
SEC's complaint against the former KowledgeWare management.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Tarkenton, Addington, 48, and Gossett, 47, the
other executives named in the SEC complaint were Lee R. Fontaine,
34, manager of financial reporting; William E. Hammersla III, 45,
vice president for direct sales in the Northeastern U.S.; Eladio
Alvarez, 41, district sales manager in the company's direct sales
group; and Edward Welch, 55, district sales manager in the Reseller
Channel Sales group.
</P>
<P>
   All but Alvarez and Welch consented to the SEC's judgment and
agreed to pay civil fines varying from $100,000 for Addington to
$10,000 for Fontaine.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC also said it settled administrative proceedings aginst
four former KnowledgeWare sales executives charged with
participating in the financial scheme.
</P>
<P>
   They are Laura M. Drews, 35, a vice president; Stephen J. Pace,
39, vice president of direct sales for the Southern and Mid-Western
states; Robert S. Chamberlain, 41, vice pesident of direct sales in
the West; and Joseph A. Mathes, 38, a district manager.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said all four had settled the proceedings without
admitting or denying the Commission's findings. They were required
to disgorge ``excess incentive compensation'' in amounts from
$31,824 to $6,728.
</P>
<P>
   A star quarterback at the University of Georgia and Minnesota
Vikings, Tarkenton went into the software business in 1980, two
years after retiring from pro football.
</P>
<P>
   KnowledgeWare was a highflier in the computer industry at one
point, with its stock reaching $43.25 in 1991. That's when its
performance was starting to be hurt by the shift of client
companies from mainframe computers to PCs.

COMMENTARY: GIVE THAT MAN A CIGAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ American foreign policy toward Cuba is really unique
among U.S. foreign policies. It isn't just 15 degrees off. It has
the distinction of being 360 degrees wrong.
</P>
<P>
   That is, the longstanding U.S. boycott and isolation of Cuba is
a failed policy if your desire is to punish Cuba's people so they
will oust Fidel Castro, and it is a failed policy if your desire is
to ease the pain on Cuba's people while they wait for Castro to
pass away. It is a failed policy if you think we should be
preparing for a post-Castro Cuba. And it is a failed policy if you
think we should be trying to bring down Castro today. It is a
failed policy if you believe in human rights, and it is a failed
policy if you believe only in trade.
</P>
<P>
   With Castro having celebrated his 40th anniversary in power,
it's safe to say U.S. policy hasn't worked in any direction. And no
wonder. It's not really a policy. It's an  &UR; attitude &LR;  _ a blind
hunger for revenge against Castro by a small, exile Cuban-American
minority residing largely in Florida, and a blind hunger for
campaign contributions from this Cuban minority by U.S.
congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   What would a sensible Cuba policy look like? First, it would
acknowledge that the unilateral U.S. boycott of Cuba has not
weakened the regime. Cuba can still trade with 160 other countries.
Does that mean Cuba's economy is flourishing? No, but not because
of our boycott. It isn't flourishing for the same reason that the
Soviet economy crumbled _  &UR; because communism doesn't work &LR; .
Communism is great for producing missiles, but terrible when it
comes to breakfast, lunch and dinner. What ails the Cuban economy
is the  &UR; internal &LR;  embargo here, the self-imposed sanctions that
come from Cuba still adhering to failed Marxist economics.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing the U.S. embargo does is obscure that fact and
give the regime another excuse for remaining iron-fisted. Castro
argues to his people that they are under siege from America,
therefore they have to remain mobilized and can't loosen up.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, this is a repressive regime. It has taught its
people to read in record numbers, but won't allow them to read what
they want; it has educated its people better than anywhere in the
Caribbean, but won't allow them to speak freely; it is a worker's
paradise where people still have to live off ration books. But it
is a repressive regime led by a charismatic figure who knows how to
stay in power. Which is why a wise U.S. policy today would be
focused primarily on shaping the post-Castro Cuba, so that we don't
have another Haiti _ where, after the regime collapses, everyone
tries to build a raft for Miami _ and the Cuban people don't have
another 40 years of repression.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, the U.S. diplomatic mission here held a lottery for
20,000 immigration visas to the United States. It received in 30
days 541,000 applications. That meant that roughly one-tenth of the
total eligible population of Cuba applied to leave. Imagine the
scramble to get out if Castro suddenly goes. There are no trade
unions here, no free non-governmental organizations, no business
groups _ none of the elements of civil society that hold a country
in place. It is Haiti waiting to happen, only closer to our shores.
</P>
<P>
   By not helping Cuba develop a transition system that can lead to
a soft landing after Castro (who is 73), we are insuring a hard
landing. Our best tool for shaping post-Castro Cuba is engaging
with Cuba now: letting more Cubans study in the United States,
training their technocrats to run a modern state, and, yes, opening
the way for some U.S. investment and trade.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, in the short term Castro would use any openness to his
advantage. But he's using our boycott to his advantage already. The
difference is what U.S. engagement with Cuba would produce  &UR; in the
long run. &LR;  At a minimum it would put pressure on Castro to ease the
human rights abuses, by making it much more difficult for him to
justify continued repression. And at a maximum it would help lay
the foundations of a Cuban economy that could thrive in the future,
and insure that whoever succeeds Castro has to be more open.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere you turn here you see American influence _ despite
the boycott. They love our Chevys, they love American dollars, they
love American baseball, and they love American democracy. American
values permeate this place without even trying. Imagine what would
happen if we actually tried.

 &HT;    Deflating special teams: Kickers complain about new rule
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Minnesota's Gary Anderson and Atlanta's Morten
Andersen are two of the most prolific kickers in NFL history,
ranking first and second, respectively, in career field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, through three games this season, they are a combined
4-for-11 on field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The pair's struggles are a rallying cry for NFL kickers and
punters, who are criticizing the league's new ``K'' ball.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, 36 footballs arrived at a stadium the Friday before
a game, leaving kickers several hours to apply their personal
touch. Now, 12 balls aren't opened by officials until Sunday, and
they are locked up until kickoff. The balls are marked with a ``K''
by the laces and are used only for kicks and punts. Anyone caught
tampering with a kicking-only ball could be subject to a fine up to
$25,000.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL implemented the rule after record-setting kicking
results last season. Anderson became the league's first perfect
kicker, making all 35 field-goal and 59 extra-point attempts in the
regular season. Minnesota's Mitch Berger had 40 kickoffs for
touchbacks in 1998, an average of 2 1/2 per game. That was a league
record for touchbacks since the kickoff was moved back to the
30-yard line, breaking the old mark by 11.
</P>
<P>
   But as more kicks sailed through the end zone the past few
seasons, resulting in fewer returns, the NFL's competition
committee took a closer look at special teams. The league moved the
kickoff from the 35-yard line to the 30. The height of the kicking
tee was shortened from 3 inches to 1. Still, none of it seemed to
take the air out of kicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're asking is that the kickers kick with a regulation
NFL football,'' said George Young, the NFL's senior vice president
of football operations. ``When they complain like they have been,
what are they saying? That they've been cheating all along?''
</P>
<P>
   Since the rule was introduced, kickers have been candid about
their past attempts at turning cowhide into veal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I've heard that guys were doing anything to soften the
ball and compress it a little bit,'' said Denver kicker Jason Elam,
a graduate of Brookwood High School. ``Guys would use dryers,
microwaves, saunas, hot tubs, anything to get some moisture in
there and soften the leather.''
</P>
<P>
   While some kickers have struggled this season, statistics
indicate the ``K'' balls haven't had much of an effect. According
to Elias Sports Bureau, the average kickoff return through three
games in 1998 was 22.4 yards. The average punt return was 11.4
yards. The average punt was 44.4 yards before returns.
</P>
<P>
   After three games this season, the average kickoff return is
21.5 yards. The average punt return is 8.9 yards. The average punt
is sailing 42.7 yards. In other words, returns are down, indicating
that kickers and punters are still getting quality hang time.
</P>
<P>
   And in the most noticeable area _ field goals _ kickers have
made 76.1 percent of their attempts, up from 72.1 percent at the
same point last season.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints still haven't stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kicking balls are brand new out of the box,'' Falcons
punter Dan Stryzinski said. ``If you're a tennis player and you
have an oversized racket, your sweet spot is huge. And then if you
go back to a John McEnroe, a little-bitty wooden racket, your sweet
spot is really small and it's hard to always get a good hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the footballs, when they're brand new, the sweet spot is
almost non-existent,'' Stryzinski said, ``because the leather is
really hard and there's wax on the ball. It's slick and slides off
your foot a lot. With worked balls, the wax is off the ball, so the
leather kind of softens up and expands. When you hit it, your foot
sinks in, and you get good contact with it. There's just nothing
there with the new ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Andersen, who is 0 for 3 on field-goal attempts this season,
attributes the misses to mechanical mistakes and doesn't blame the
``K'' ball. But he doesn't like the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the more you use a football or any ball _ a
baseball, basketball or whatever _ I think the better it is to play
with because it gets broken in,'' Andersen said. ``Nobody wants to
play with a brand new ball. That's normal. Ask Michael Jordan if he
likes to dribble a ball that's brand new, versus one that's been
broken in a little bit. The same thing with a baseball pitcher. He
doesn't like a brand-new ball.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Stryzinski says he pumped up balls to 20 pounds per
square inch, seven pounds more than the 13 psi recommended by
Wilson Sporting Goods. The overinflated balls were left overnight
to stretch the leather. The next morning, Stryzinski put the balls
in a sauna for about 15 minutes. The balls were taken out and
brushed with a non-wire shoe brush to bring out the oil in the
leather and maintain the tacky feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just try to get them old by use,'' said Styrzinski, who
still works footballs thrown by quarterback Chris Chandler. ``As
long as they're not dirty and all scuffed up to the point where
they don't look new, then we'll use them in the game, because
that's how the quarterbacks and receivers like them. That's what
they've been doing for years and years, and it's never been a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Former University of Georgia kicker Todd Peterson, in his fifth
season with the Seattle Seahawks, said he used to rub balls with a
hot towel before brushing them. Peterson would over-inflate balls
twice to protrude the seams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a ball turned away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Chicago Bears kicker Jeff Jaeger was the Gaylord Perry of
the NFL. Jaeger and Bears punter Todd Sauerbrun overinflated balls
and left them sitting for three days. They would then deflate the
balls to about eight pounds and push the ends into the corner of a
table. The balls would be overinflated again, thrown into a laundry
sack with wet towels and put into a dryer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten minutes was all it would take to get them real hot,''
Sauerbrun said. ``They'd bang around in the dryer, and then we'd
brush them off.''
</P>
<P>
   If the ball needed more work, it would be deflated again and put
under hot water.
</P>
<P>
   The process got scientific last season when Sauerbrun was
injured and the Bears signed 40-year-old Mike Horan, who graduated
from Long Beach State with a degree in mechanical engineering.
Horan had a homemade contraption that consisted of a skateboard and
two-by-fours. Horan and Jaeger would repeatedly roll a 100-pound
dumbbell over the balls on the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd be almost square,'' Chicago special-teams coach Keith
Armstrong said. ``Jeff was so dedicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all kickers were allowed to ``juice'' balls, however,
because quarterbacks had the final say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every kicker loved to go to Dallas, because Troy Aikman liked
to throw with worn balls,'' Elam said. ``Everybody hated going to
San Francisco because Steve Young likes to throw a new ball. You'd
just have to know where to go and where not to go. Before I got
here, (former Broncos quarterback John) Elway told the equipment
guy not to let the kickers touch the balls. ``
</P>
<P>
   Stryzinski says that's why the NFL isn't requiring all players
to use new balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew the quarterbacks would have a big backlash,'' he
said. ``There would be guys complaining all over the league. You'd
see a lot of fumbles, you'd see a lot of slipped passes, you'd see
a lot of guys dropping passes. Basically, the kickers are left out.
What are we going to do? Everybody would just say, 'Oh, the kickers
are whining.'''

 &HT;    Falcons' focus is increasing tempo
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Henri Crockett was talking about the annoyance of
fuzzballs on his back. He had the right idea, but the wrong
annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who saw Sunday's 35-7 loss at St. Louis knows what coach
Dan Reeves was talking about when he said the Rams played ``at a
different speed'' than Atlanta. The Falcons (0-3) looked like they
had anchors on their backs.
</P>
<P>
   So after the team's most lopsided loss in nearly three years,
the first goal on Sunday against Baltimore (1-2) is simple. ``We
got to play faster,'' right tackle Ephraim Salaam said.
</P>
<P>
   Several Falcons said they didn't sense their slow motion on the
field, but they got an eyeful _ and an earful _ watching the
replay. Atlanta looked like a team with no sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't really notice until you watch film,'' Crockett said.
``It was really bad, embarrassing. I can understand what (Reeves)
means. It's almost like having lint on your back. You don't know
it's there until someone points it out to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams were fresh after a bye week, and the Falcons were on
the road after losing Monday night in Dallas. Still, attitude had a
lot to do with what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to set the tempo,'' middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle
said. ``We're sitting back . . . and waiting for things to happen.
We're not the same team we were last year, and we got to figure out
what it takes to get back to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves is rethinking his team's approach to practice. For
example, players had been particularly lethargic during Friday's
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times you think you can throw a switch on in games,
but you can't,'' Crockett said. ``It's got to start (today) in
practice. We've got to do the same things we mean to in games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons were a hunter last year; this year, they're among
the hunted. They've got to get faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat the Rams last year (37-15 and 21-10),'' Salaam said.
``They wanted to punch us in the mouth, and we just kind of stood
around and let them. We got killed. I need to get more aggressive .
. . and put it all on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons re-signed defensive tackle Shawn Swayda to bolster
an injury-riddled line and terminated the contract of 16-year
offensive lineman/deep snapper Adam Schreiber. Swayda, 25, played
for Atlanta last season and was cut after one game this season. The
move leaves the Falcons a little more than $200,000 under the
salary cap.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG'S CANCER WAS DISCOVERED AT EARLY STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to correct two misspellings of Ginsburg, in grafs 6 and(sw) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The colon cancer diagnosed in Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg has apparently not spread, and was discovered at an early
stage by accident because the justice suffered symptoms from an
unrelated abdominal infection, the Supreme Court announced on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 66-year-old justice went home from Washington Hospital
Center on Tuesday, 11 days after surgeons removed her sigmoid
colon, a two-foot length of bowel that comprises the lower third of
the large intestine. Doctors have classified her cancer as being in
the second of four stages; about 75 percent of Stage Two colon
cancer patients are cured, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The justice is very lucky to have had this picked up
incidentally,'' said Dr. Harmon Eyre, chief medical officer for the
American Cancer Society in Atlanta. ``If it had been left alone it
would have advanced to another stage.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, the court's public information officer,
Kathleen Arberg, said a small tumor, measuring about two by three
centimeters, had invaded the justice's colon and entered the outer
muscle but did not penetrate through it. Subsequent tests showed no
evidence that the disease had spread to the lymph nodes or any
other organ.
</P>
<P>
   The tests results are a good sign, Eyre said, but they are no
guarantee. In some patients, ``there can be microscopic spread''
that does not turn up in early biopsies.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg became ill this summer while teaching in a law school
program on the Greek Island of Crete. Doctors at first thought she
had acute diverticulitis, a disorder of the large intestine, but
later diagnosed colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it turns out, the diverticulitis diagnosis may have been
correct after all; according to Ms. Arberg's statement, Dr. Lee
Smith, the surgeon at Washington Hospital Center who performed the
operation on Sept. 17 on Ginsburg, also discovered a perforation
higher in her bowel. The perforation, which was not malignant,
caused her abdominal infection.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her hospitalization, Ginsburg has been participating in
the court's recent work, although whether she has been involved by
telephone, written memo or in some other way was unclear. The court
on Tuesday issued a list of nine cases that it intends to hear this
term; there was no announcement that Ginsburg was absent, as is
customary when justices do not take part in deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Eyre said most patients in Ginsburg's condition need at least a
month to six weeks to recuperate from surgery, possibly longer in
her case if there are complications from the perforated bowel. She
should heal completely, he said, without any need for a colostomy,
and may not need any chemotherapy or radiation. Doctors should make
that determination after evaluating samples of her cancerous
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The justice should be monitored closely from now on for any
evidence of a recurrence. That typically includes an annual
colonoscopy, in which doctors use a lighted scope to examine the
length of the colon, as well as periodic blood tests.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cancer of the colon and rectum is the second leading cause of
cancer deaths in the United States, after lung cancer. It is also
one of the most curable of cancers, but only if it is found in the
early stages. Although many women think of colorectal cancer as a
man's disease, that is not the case. Ginsburg is among 67,000 women
_ 4,600 more women than men _ who will have the disease diagnosed
in the United States this year, according to the American Cancer
Society.
</P>
<P>
   Because colon cancer develops slowly and has a long precancerous
stage, it is easily prevented. A tumor the size of Ginsburg's, for
instance, might take about two to three years to develop, Eyre
said, and might take three to five years before causing any
symptoms. But by that time, the disease would be more advanced, and
much more difficult to treat. The cancer society recommends regular
colon cancer screening for women and men, 50 and older.

<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ China is celebrating 50 years of communist
rule this week in part by hosting more than 300 of the world's
leading capitalists at a conference in this city.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fortune Global Forum is unintentionally highlighting the
deeply troubled nature of China's business dealings with the West.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, at the gala opening on Monday night, Time Warner
chairman Gerald Levin , personally introduced President Jiang
Zemin, a leader he has assiduously courted for nearly 15 years,
repeatedly describing him as ``my good friend.'' Time Warner,
publisher of Fortune, is sponsoring the conference _ ambitiously
entitled ``China: The Next 50 Years'' _ with the Shanghai municipal
government.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not stop China's authorities from banning newsstand
sales of a special China edition of Time Warner's flagship
magazine, Time, because it included essays by the Dalai Lama, the
Tibetan spiritual leader, and by the Chinese political exiles Wei
Jingsheng and Fang Lizhi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disappointing, at what is meant to celebrate China's
opening to the outside world, when they still feel the need to
censor anything they don't like,'' said Adi Ignatius, deputy editor
of Time Asia, who edited the special edition.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointment, born of misunderstanding, wishful thinking and
crossed purposes, plagues other aspects of the relationship.
Chinese leaders still seem to believe Western executives should
want to help China modernize first, and make money second. Western
businessmen, routinely blinded by the attraction of a seemingly
limitless market, often suspend common business sense to spend
millions before they can even project a potential profit.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, like other media conglomerates, would like to enter
China's movie and music markets, but has so far been blocked by
Chinese officials who are generally mistrustful of foreign media
companies. Executives like Levin are typically circumspect in
discussing how aggressively they would like to come to China, for
fear of alarming the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Levin spoke at the conference on Tuesday about how Time
Warner can help people in China, arguing that his company should do
a service to all humanity by trying to help new talent find a
public voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go into a market like China, you recognize talented
artists and give them an opportunity for expression, that's an
important public role,'' Levin said. ``Companies like ours have a
role to play in creating world harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with Jiang earlier in the day, Levin presented his
host with a piece of Americana: a bust of Abraham Lincoln.
Receiving the gift, according to an executive who was present,
Jiang beamed as his praises were sung by the Time Warner chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang is apparently accustomed to being told by his colleagues
how wise and insightful he is, so he may have been expecting
something similar from Levin. Instead, the American guest worked up
to an unexpected crescendo: praising Jiang as one of the few world
leaders who can recite the Gettysburg Address from memory, a parlor
trick that Jiang repeats for many American visitors.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Though approval from high officials can go a long way in China,
Western businessmen with experience here point out that it is no
guarantee for business success, since China is still a relatively
poor country where legal guarantees are virtually worthless,
corruption is rampant, and many basic services are unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights In China, a New York-based group, complained that
the Fortune Global Forum had improperly left human rights concerns
off the agenda, since an international conference offers a chance
to raise issues that ordinary Chinese people can not touch in a
public venue.
</P>
<P>
   However, despite the conference's serious-sounding title, it
seemed clear that many participants came here not to analyze or
proscribe China's needs as much as to explore possible ways to make
money.
</P>
<P>
   Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom Inc., which owns MTV, seemed
to take a relatively direct approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 3 billion people in Asia and 2 billion of them are
in the MTV generation,'' Redstone said at a session of the
conference. ``That's who we're after.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference later, Redstone, whose company recently
announced its intention to acquire CBS, said that international
news organizations should avoid being unnecessarily offensive to
foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Journalistic integrity must prevail in the final analysis,''
Redstone said. ``But that doesn't mean that journalistic integrity
should be exercised in a way that is unnecessarily offensive to the
countries in which you operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Other visiting executives did not hide their efforts to woo
Chinese hosts by saying unabashedly nice things about the communist
government.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Greenberg, chairman of American International Group, the
insurance giant, has been courting Chinese leaders for 25 years.
Despite this early entry into the local insurance market, his
staffers here have little sense of when they might begin to make a
profit.
</P>
<P>
   At the conference on Tuesday, Greenberg went out of his way to
praise the communist rulers, brushing aside a suggestion that more
democracy was needed by arguing that the main job in China is
simply feeding the population of 1.3 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as several Chinese economists here have pointed out,
bumper harvests and overcapacity have created huge food surpluses
this year, contributing to sagging farm incomes and the danger of
excessive deflation. Polls show, meantime, that the overwhelming
concerns of Chinese businessmen are corruption and official
mismanagement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Apart from all the big-name executives, and official wooing, the
conference seemed to have another, perhaps unexpected feature. It
gave many of the 200 Chinese participants a chance to question
their own leaders in a public way that is ordinarily off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   Zeng Peiyan, chairman of the State Development Planning
Commission, appeared surprised Tuesday when he faced hard questions
from the Chinese businessmen in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   One Chinese executive asked Zeng why his commission could not
put a time limit on applications for project approval, as happens
in other countries. A manager of a state-run company complained
that he was hemmed in by restrictions in China's labor markets. He
said it was difficult to hire and fire people because the
authorities have been slow to create a promised social security
system to help laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
   Zeng defended his commission's work, but did not answer in
detail.

BRADLEY'S HEALTH PLAN WOULD USE TAX CREDITS AND EXISTING PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley proposed a
$65-billion-a-year plan Tuesday that he said would make health care
available to virtually all uninsured Americans through an ambitious
expansion of federal tax subsidies and insurance programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's proposal would offer health coverage to lower income
adults and children in one of two ways: by allowing them to join,
with little or no premium costs, the federal government's health
insurance system for its employees, or by providing tax credits to
subsidize their premiums in private insurance plans.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, a family of four earning nearly $50,000 in
gross annual income would be eligible for at least a partial
federal subsidy of their health insurance premiums. Bradley would
also reduce health care costs for people in higher income brackets
by excluding all health insurance premiums paid by individuals,
regardless of their income, from federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that if all eligible people participated in his
plan, 95 percent of the country's 45 million uninsured adults and
children would receive health care. But health care experts said it
was highly unlikely that so many people would participate in a
voluntary plan.
</P>
<P>
   The former senator said his plan would not require new taxes,
and could be financed using the non-Social Security surplus,
projected to be more than $1 trillion over the next decade, as well
as cost-saving measures. But he underscored the preliminary nature
of the proposal by saying he did not have a back-up financing plan
if the economy turns sour and the surplus evaporates.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his 30-minute speech at a community college here,
Bradley sounded a populist tone, calling good health care a solemn
right, not a luxury, that is the responsibility of the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not talking about the irresponsible or the negligent,''
he said of the uninsured, but ``people you and I know'' who are one
catastrophic illness away from bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   It is wrong, he continued, ``that kings and dictators can come
to this country to get the best medical care in the world, while
Americans two blocks away may not be able to afford any care at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's plan is more ambitious than one proposed earlier this
month by his lone rival for the Democratic nomination, Vice
President Al Gore, and thus continues his effort to sharpen his
appeal to liberal Democrats. Gore proposed making health care
available to all children, but did not go as far as Bradley in
making it accessible to adults.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast Bradley's plan is less extensive, and certainly less
regimented, than President Clinton's complicated proposal that was
killed by Congress in 1994. That proposal would have required all
employers to provide health insurance for their workers and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley _ who did not play a central role in the 1994 fight _
described his plan Tuesday as the kind of bold stroke the nation
needs to solve it serious health care problems. But he also
asserted that it would have a better chance of passing than
Clinton's proposal because it is simpler, requires less
bureaucracy, gives people greater say over their insurance plans
and will be debated more openly.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference following his speech, Bradley also took
a sharp shot at Gore, calling the vice president's health care plan
``timid'' and a clear illustration of how his administration would
differ from Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are differences between trying to do something
big, to deal with a big problem that affects almost all Americans,
and continuing to be advocating incremental change'' Bradley said.
``It is a fundamental difference between the candidacies.''
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized Gore for not having laid out the cost of his
proposal, saying, ``A campaign proposal without a price tag is just
another politician's promise.''
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Gore said Bradley's plan failed to address the
financial problems of Medicare, the government health care program
for the elderly. The Clinton administration has proposed setting
aside $374 billion of the surplus over the next 10 years to shore
up the program. Bradley's proposal would eat up too much of the
surplus to do that, the aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shortchanging of Medicare is, I think, a huge problem with
the Bradley plan,'' said Elaine Kamarck, a policy adviser to Gore.
She also said Bradley had probably underestimated the cost of his
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also said he would require all children to have health
insurance. But he did not propose an enforcement mechanism, saying,
``you have to have trust in the basic goodness of the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan drew an odd mixture of reactions from people on both
ends of the political spectrum. Liberals, while applauding its
intent, said it fell short of universal care, while conservatives
praised its use of tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a step in the right direction,'' said Stuart Butler, vice
president for domestic research with the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative policy organization. ``It's a very shrewd plan that
builds on a bipartisan base.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a national
organization for health care consumers, warned that the plan might
encourage companies to eliminate health insurance for employees,
pushing them into the federal plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been a fan of using the tax code as the best
vehicle for achieving coverage,'' Pollack said. ``It does have the
possibility of providing tax breaks for people that don't need
them. And it could result in employer based coverage being scaled
back.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's proposal would essentially replace Medicaid, the
government health care program for the poor, with a new system run
entirely by the federal government that would continue to finance
care for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid costs are currently split among federal, state and
local governments. Under his plan, the federal government would pay
the full cost of acute care for low-income adults and children,
while states would pick up the entire Medicaid cost of long-term
nursing home care for the elderly. The swap would reduce states'
costs by $18 billion a year, Bradley's aides said.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan would go beyond current government programs by
using the tax code to help the working poor and higher income
people.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Bradley would give lower income families and
individuals tax credits to help pay for premiums. Children living
in families earning under 200 percent of the poverty line _ or
$32,800 a year in gross income for a family of four _ would receive
a $1,200 tax subsidy. That is enough to pay annual premiums in many
private plans, Bradley's aides said.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller tax credit would be available to families earning
between 200 percent and 300 percent of the poverty level, which is
$49,200 a year in gross income for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   Adults, with or without children, would receive a $1,800 tax
credit if their income was below poverty level, which is $16,400
gross annual income for a family of four. Adults earning between
100 percent and 200 percent of the poverty line would receive
somewhat smaller credits.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would allow people to use the tax credits, which would
be paid in advance directly to insurance companies, to pay for
insurance premiums. The credits could be used either with the
federal Employees Health Benefits Program, a system of private
companies that insures federal employees, or with any other private
insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Nine million federal workers, including members of Congress,
currently belong to the federal employees system. Bradley's aides
estimated that as many as two-thirds of the 33 million unemployed
adults in the country might join the federal system if the plan
were enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Health care experts also said that opening the Federal Employees
Health Benefits Program to a tide of lower income people, many of
them unemployed, would place costly new burdens on the program and
potentially drive up premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would also exclude all health insurance premium payments
by individuals from federal taxes. And he would create an optional
prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients that would have a
$500 deductible, $25 monthly premium and 25 percent co-payment fee.

 &HT;    New rainfall could delay flood inspections
 &HT;    By Travis Fain
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ City officials expect inspection teams to
finish their walk-through of damaged homes by Friday, assuming
floodwaters ebb as expected.
</P>
<P>
   Most Greenville homes south of the Tar River have been
inspected, with the exception of some apartments in Tar River
Estates and Dockside apartments, city spokeswoman Katie Veilleux
said. Roughly 650 homes had been inspected through Tuesday, she
said. Officials only inspect buildings that had more than a foot of
water in them.
</P>
<P>
   Water is pooling up in some places, unable to flow back into the
Tar River. City staff members are considering using pumps to move
the water, but no definite plans have been developed, Veilleux
said.
</P>
<P>
   County teams have not said when they expect to finish their
inspections, but had almost finished areas where the water had
receded Tuesday evening, according to Pitt County Spokesman Arlen
Holt. About three-fourths of the homes county teams inspected will
need repairs before they are inhabitable, Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   Three-plus inches of rain Monday and Tuesday halted the county's
inspection process Monday afternoon, Holt said. City crews worked
through the rain, Veilleux said.
</P>
<P>
   The rain, combined with super-saturated roadsides, also caused
washouts on several Pitt County roads, some that had just been
repaired. Rocks are being used to combat erosion on road shoulders,
but are not as effective as grass, said Grady Raynor, a
transportation supervisor with the N.C. Department of
Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   DOT officials cruised the county looking for sinkholes Tuesday,
but there are probably some that have not been discovered yet,
Raynor said. He suggested people only drive if they have to and
urged caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they drive through standing water, there may not be road
under there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar River was at 21.2 feet Tuesday at 4 p.m., down just over
a foot from 24 hours before, according to readings at the
Greenville water treatment plant. It fell a tenth of a foot from 2
p.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday, the readings show. The river leaves its
banks at 13 feet and was at more than 16 feet before Floyd hit the
morning of Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff and rescue crews had almost completed their search for
dead in the county Tuesday afternoon, Sheriff Mac Manning said. No
flood-related deaths have been discovered in Pitt County since
Ronald Russell's body was pulled from Hardee Creek Saturday
afternoon. Russell's is the fourth confirmed death in the county
attributed to flooding. A Grifton man was also discovered dead in
the Grifton area by Craven County rescue officials.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the first of about 200 expected trailers arrived
at a site on County Home Road, Rudy Hernandez, a spokesman for the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, said. State officials
requested the trailers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency
to provide temporary housing for hurricane victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is to try to get at least 20 a day starting
(today),'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   County officials are securing other sites for the campers,
including one owned by East Carolina University. They hope to get
at least 500 trailers altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Most people have cooperated with law enforcement officers at
barricades barring entry into areas that haven't been inspected,
Veilleux and Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very calm, considering what they're looking at just
over the barricade,'' Veilleux said. ``People have been really
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people have complained, Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   The barricades are meant to keep people out until teams can
inspect homes for structural damage, gas leaks, water-affected
electrical wiring and other dangers, both said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents who turned a house key over to inspection teams will
get a call from a city clerk to get their key back as well as a
preliminary inspection report, Veilleux said. Once the first round
of assessments is done, inspectors will be available to give a more
detailed rundown of a home's problems.
</P>
<P>
   The city's 10 inspection teams are marking homes with X's to
show they've been examined. An X with a box around it means a home
has been condemned. An X with a slash through it means residents
can go inside to get their things, but the home is not inhabitable
without repairs.
</P>
<P>
   County teams _ there are about 10 of them _ are placing stickers
on inspected homes along with a flood-damage checklist describing
problems, Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   The county is issuing permits to residents whose homes have not
been inspected allowing them to go inside during daylight hours and
at their own risk. The permits are available at the Pactolus and
Staton House fire departments, Gum Swamp Church and the Tax
Assessor's office downtown. The tax assessor's office is open from
8 a.m. to 8 p.m. The other three sites close at 5 p.m., Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary entry permits are not available in Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile homes will not be allowed on residential property while
homes are repaired, according to the city. Recreational vehicles
will be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary buildings are OK at commercial sites while repairs are
underway, but also require a renewable 90-day permit, the release
said. Those structures cannot be used as residences.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officers have set up several checkpoints around
flooded areas and are patrolling others, Manning said. Military
police officers will be pulling out today and will be replaced by
state law enforcement officers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of inspections Tuesday _ and in some cases before _
Pitt residents continued to survey the devastation left by ebbing
waters. In one home north of the river, Donny Wilson stepped across
his parents' living room floor, lifting tossed about furniture out
of the way as he went.
</P>
<P>
   The room smelled of rot, its white walls stained with brown
spots to five feet. Wilson's parents had lived there almost 30
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, wooden beams sat atop a station wagon in the front
yard. They floated over a 4 1/2-foot fence to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Trees in the front yard were beginning to show their fall
colors, yellow and red. But to eight feet, the leaves hung dead and
brown, rotting off their stems.
</P>
<P>
   A wooden barn sat in the side yard. It floated there from behind
the house, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see that red barn in the ditch,'' said Wilson's
5-year-old nephew Cliff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I see,'' Wilson replied. ``How'd it get there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The rain took it there,'' Cliff said.

 &HT;    Ryder buzz not yet fading
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE MOUNTAIN, Ga. _ Forty-eight hours after The Putt, life had
turned decidely more tranquil for Justin Leonard. When his ball
rammed into the back of the cup at the 17th hole Sunday at the
Ryder Cup, triggering the type of celebration usually reserved for
3-point shots at the buzzer, most every golf fan on the globe
seemingly was tuned in.
</P>
<P>
   When Leonard reached the 18th green Tuesday at Callaway Gardens,
playing a nine-hole practice round for this week's Buick Challenge,
the grandstand contained exactly five people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty quiet atmosphere here,'' Leonard said, ``and I
think we're all kind of looking forward to that. I'll probably get
more rest here than I would being at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Brookline's carryover greeted U.S. players Leonard, Davis Love
III, Steve Pate and Jeff Maggert at first sight of the Mountain
View course. Tournament officials added a sign on the road to the
clubhouse parking lot that read: ``Buick Challenge Welcomes The
Ryder Cup Champions.'' Leonard and Pate got handshakes and
high-fives all over the course. Michael Bradley tapped fists with
Leonard at the 10th teebox. Skip Kendall followed with a way-to-go.
Other caddies were applauding Leonard's caddie, Bob Riefke.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard realizes it might be hard to concentrate on his game for
a few days, but he isn't complaining. It's was heart-warming to go
home to Dallas for a day to hear a phone answering machine jammed
to the maximum with messages. Oh, and The Putt, he had decided was
50 feet, not 45.
</P>
<P>
   ``My putt wouldn't have made a difference had those first
matches not gone out the way they did,'' Leonard said of a U.S.
avalanche of six consecutive victories Sunday. ``Not only did those
guys win, they won by wide margins. . . . They got the Europeans to
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate, who won a crucial match against Miguel Angel Jimenez,
still felt the effects of the party that broke up at 2:30 a.m.
``Obviously, we dug ourselves a huge hole, but I don't think
anybody in that meeting room ever doubted we could do it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbs are still filling the European tabloids regarding the
Americans' celebration after Leonard's putt. Captain Mark James
said that European players might refrain from playing in future
Cups because of the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The celebration on the 17th green) was something that
shouldn't have happened,'' Leonard said, ``but it was not that big
of a deal. I'm not bad-mouthing anybody, but every time Sergio
(Garcia) made a putt, he was hugging somebody.'' For all the hoopla
of the putt at 17, nearly overlooked was Leonard's 45-footer at the
15th hole to even his match with Jose Maria Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a lot of fun talking about all the matches,''
Leonard said of the victory dinner. ``We were just marveling at
some of the shots the other guys made and some of the putts that
were made.''
</P>
<P>
   Note: Ben Crenshaw, basking in the glow of the victory, said two
years as captain of the U.S. team was enough. A 2001 captain will
be chosen later this year. The team gave Crenshaw a signed copy of
the Cup and he took it to show-and-tell at his two daughters'
schools in Austin, Texas.

SUSPECT BLAMES CO-DEFENDANTS IN SLAYING OF BLACK MAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The third capital murder suspect in last year's
dragging death of a black man near Jasper blames his two
co-defendants for the crime, saying he tried to stop them from
beating James Byrd Jr. but backed off when his own life was
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared me. I didn't know what was going on,'' Shawn Berry
told CBS correspondent Dan Rather in an interview aired Tuesday
night on ``60 Minutes II.'' ``I never saw anything like that, so I
backed away. And they grabbed him, took him to the back of the
truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry, 24, said he then heard his co-defendants, John William
``Bill'' King and Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr., pulling a logging
chain from the back of his pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was petrified. I couldn't move,'' he said. ``And when ...
Russell kicked him and he didn't move anymore ... I wet my pants.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, June 7, 1998, Byrd's mutilated body was found.
Byrd, 49, had been chained by the ankles and dragged more than two
miles before his head slammed into a concrete culvert, decapitating
him.
</P>
<P>
   Placing the blame on his two buddies is in keeping with Berry's
first statements to police, but the television interview offers
more detail. Jasper prosecutor Guy James Gray said some of those
details conflict with Berry's earlier statements. He declined to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have to contend with the fact that he has given
varying versions of his story,'' Gray said. ``The more times a
defendant talks, the more opportunity to catch him if he's not
telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's blood was found on Berry's shirt, pants and one of his
boots. Berry contends the blood got there when Byrd brushed against
him while scuffling with King and Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's sister, Mary Verrett of Houston, called Tuesday's
interview ``abominable'' and said the defendants are ``pathological
liars out to save their own skin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the truth,'' she said. ``Who started the truck, I don't
know. But all three of them were involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week at his trial in Bryan, Texas, Brewer, a 32-year-old
white supremacist, was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to
death.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer testified for more than four hours, crying and blaming
Berry, who he said slashed Byrd's throat and then chained him to
the pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's former prison buddy and fellow white supremacist, King,
24, was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in
February. He did not testify.
</P>
<P>
   Berry is to be tried late next month in his hometown of Jasper
and intends to testify.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview with Rather, Berry said he and his friends were
planning to drink beer and cruise the backroads of Jasper County
when they saw Byrd walking home from a party. Berry offered him a
ride and then drove to a rural logging road in the woods east of
town.
</P>
<P>
   Before he knew what was happening, he said, King and Brewer had
jumped out and were pulling Byrd from the cab of the pickup. King
was shouting that he was going to kill the man, Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got in between Bill and him. And I told Bill ... you know,
`Stop.' And he said `Back off. The same thing can happen to
(you.)'''
</P>
<P>
   He said King and Brewer were laughing and joking as they beat
and kicked Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw them chain him up. I didn't ... I don't know how
he was chained or where he was chained,'' Berry said. ``And they
started dragging him down that dirt road.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry said he was seated in the cab of the truck between King,
who was driving, and Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russell had looked back one time and started laughing and
said, `Look, he's rolling,' or `He's bouncing around all over the
place,''' Berry said. ``They were having fun. They had him. They
were acting like they were having just a good old time.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he said, Brewer looked back and said that Byrd had
come undone. King stopped the pickup, and he and Brewer got out and
chained Byrd again and continued dragging him, Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I'd been able to help him,'' Berry said. ``I wish I
wouldn't have chickened out. I think I let a lot of people down.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry's attorney, Joseph C. ``Lum'' Hawthorn of Beaumont, said
Tuesday that Berry agreed to the interview in hopes of improving
his image before his trial starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn has been characterized as a racist and as a cruel and
violent person. None of those things are true,'' Hawthorn said.
``This was a good opportunity to reply to those accusations. He
wants to make sure the public understands that he is not like the
other two.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn said Berry, who was interviewed Sept. 18 at the Jasper
County Jail, spent two hours with Rather and answered every
question he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Berry's story could be reconciled with Brewer's
testimony, Hawthorn said, ``I don't think the two can be
reconciled. I think Brewer was lying.''

 MCCAIN WOULD PAY FOR VOUCHERS BY CUTTING SUBSIDIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C. _ Sen. John McCain, now a full-fledged
candidate for the presidency, called for a school voucher program
on Tuesday that he said should be paid for by cutting federal
subsidies on oil, gas, ethanol and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   With Charleston Harbor and the USS Yorktown serving as a
backdrop to highlight his Vietnam War record, McCain used the
occasion to underscore his image as a war hero, and to link for the
first time two of the major themes of his campaign, fighting
special interests and providing greater school choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children deserve the best education that we can make
available to them, whether that learning takes place in a public,
private or parochial school,'' McCain told an audience filled with
veterans in VFW caps and military metals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will find the necessary money for those most in need, by
taking it from those least in need,'' he added. ``We give hundreds
of millions of dollars in subsidies to the producers of ethanol, to
oil and gas and sugar manufacturers who are wealthy beyond the
dreams of most hard-working Americans. I challenge my opponents to
join me in taking the money that we've been giving to the special
interests and spend it instead on a child in need.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain coupled his attack on subsidies with his long-standing
crusade for campaign finance reform. In his mind, reducing the
influence of money in politics would reduce the pressure on
Congress to finance pet projects of major contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, McCain introduced a bill to finance school vouchers
by cutbacks in the ethanol subsidy program, only to have it
defeated in the Senate. On Tuesday, he added oil and gas and sugar
subsidies to the list of possible financing sources for school
vouchers, a program favored by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain's talk was about schools and special interests, the
day was also heavy in symbols of the military theme that runs
through McCain's campaign _ as a Navy pilot, he was a prisoner of
war for five and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   The setting here, the Patriots Point Naval &AMP; Maritime Museum,
highlighted not only his own military history but one that goes
back three generations in his family.
</P>
<P>
   The Yorktown was part of the carrier force that was commanded by
his grandfather, Adm. John S. McCain, and it also carried a replica
on its flight deck of the A-4 ``Skyhawk'' that McCain was flying
when he was shot down in 1967. Men in ``Comrades for McCain''
T-shirts populated the crowd, while a submarine, a destroyer and a
Coast Guard cutter also added to the backdrop. And, as he spoke, a
steady parade of military aircraft flew overhead, en route to the
nearby airport.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech here, McCain reiterated much of what he said on
Monday, when he announced his candidacy in New Hampshire: Calls for
higher defense spending, denunciations of economic protectionism,
and the need for ``broad and deep experience'' when making the
``life and death decisions'' as president to send troops into
combat.
</P>
<P>
   And while these themes produced hearty applause from the crowd
of 500, the focus of the day was his plan to pay for the voucher
program cutting subsidies to the the ethanol, oil and gas and sugar
industries. His campaign against ethanol subsidies is one reason he
has steered clear of the Iowa straw poll, where much of ethanol is
produced, and his attacks on oil and gas interests hit an industry
that is a leading contributor to the campaign of Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the ``biggest challenge'' of paying for a voucher
program to allow students to switch to private or parochial schools
is doing it while still supporting the public school system. And he
believes that the money could be found if campaign finance reform
were enacted and subsidies were cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's take that money, and instead of using it to pay off
campaign contributors with special tax breaks, let's spend it on
the children who have been trapped in our worse schools,'' said
McCain. ``Let's take that money, and use it to set children free,
to give them an educational opportunity that can provide them with
a real future.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, what many in the crowd said was McCain's uppermost appeal
was his status as a war hero and his cry for spending less on
high-cost weapons systems and more on enlisted personnel and
veterans. The fact that McCain suffered greatly while in prison,
yet emerged to become a member of the Senate, was enough for many
here to believe that he has the character and leadership to run the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Burkhold, a money manager from Charleston, said, ``It's
important to me that John McCain is a hero. It's important to me
that we dignify the office of the president with a person who has
the status of being a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   And Will Buddin, a real estate agent from Summerville, S.C.,
said that he felt McCain's war experiences mean that ``he can give
leadership back to this country. It's not just giving us economic
strength, but for the world to look to us as a power to emulate,
not to denigrate.''

RUSSIAN LAUNDERING INQUIRY MARRED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT RIVALRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: 2nd take should move within 20 minutes, followed by 3rd
take.)

 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and LOWELL BERGMAN  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The investigation of Russian money flowing through
the Bank of New York has been hampered by one of the oldest and
bitterest rivalries in American law enforcement _ between the
Manhattan District Attorney and the FBI's powerful New York office.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, law enforcement officials say, investigators
for each agency separately discovered that shadowy figures were
using an obscure company, the Benex Corp., to move money out of
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiries began from separate points _ a kidnapping case for
the FBI and a suspected money-laundering operation for the New York
prosecutors. Each side had information the other lacked that
ultimately showed that these were two pieces of a single puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   But the information was never pooled, officials said. In fact,
FBI officials are said to have been angered when British
investigators, who were conducting their own investigation of
Russian organized crime, told a New York prosecutor and a State
Department official what they knew about the federal case.
</P>
<P>
   Since the investigation burst into public view in August, each
side has been trying to leave the impression that it was hotly
pursuing the case while its counterpart was dragging its feet or
chasing down empty leads.
</P>
<P>
   Relations have become so frayed that federal investigators have
let it be known that FBI officials and federal attorneys even
discussed whether they could file obstruction-of-justice charges
against counterparts in other agencies whom they perceived as
getting in the way.
</P>
<P>
   These disputes _ and the larger question of how they affected
the outcome of the investigation _ are far from resolved. But
several points are now clear.
</P>
<P>
   The office of Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau
was the first to find the link between Benex and the Bank of New
York and has looked closely at the maze of companies that his
investigators believe were the conduit for the money. But, federal
officials said, Morgenthau never closely examined the bank's role
in the affair and did not obtain crucial banking records that
disclosed billions of dollars in suspicious transfers from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI focused on the bank more than a year ago and was the
first agency to understand the size of the Benex transactions. But
the bureau has been faulted by some administration officials for
failing to tell other agencies, including the Treasury Department
and State Department, what it knew about such an important banking
case with broad diplomatic implications.

MUSEUM FILES FIRST-AMENDMENT SUIT OVER GIULIANI'S THREAT TO END
FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a pronounced escalation of the political and
cultural conflict over an impending art exhibition, the Brooklyn
Museum of Art on Tuesday filed a lawsuit in federal court accusing
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of violating the First Amendment by
threatening to withdraw city funds from the museum because he finds
some of the artworks offensive and insulting to religion.
</P>
<P>
   In taking the action, the museum abandoned its recent efforts to
resolve the dispute through some form of negotiated compromise;
indeed, the museum's board of trustees voted overwhelmingly Tuesday
to reject Giuliani's request for another day of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   There was no more talk of removing or otherwise segregating
those works that the mayor deems most troubling. By preemptively
filing a lawsuit, museum officials said that they hoped to thrust
the dispute into the constitutional arena of free speech and
expression, thereby undercutting the city's legal strategy of
challenging the exhibit on the narrow grounds that it violates the
museum's lease with the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``This litigation is not just about the Brooklyn Museum of
Art,'' said Robert S. Rubin, the chairman of the museum's board of
trustees, during a tense late-afternoon press conference in the
museum's lobby. ``It is being undertaken in the interests of all
public institutions _ museums, universities and libraries _ that
are dedicated to the free exchange of ideas and information, and in
the interests of the people they serve.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The response from City Hall was swift and angry. Although
Giuliani was traveling Tuesday on a political trip to Washington,
D.C., and Las Vegas, Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota described the
mayor's reaction this way: ``The mayor was not surprised by the
level of arrogance shown by the board of the museum.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani immediately ordered city officials to cancel the city's
next scheduled payment to the museum _ $497,554 _ which is due Oct.
1.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he did not appear willing to take more drastic steps to
prevent the exhibition from going forward as planned Saturday. City
officials instead focused their immediate efforts on seizing
control of the museum through what they predicted would be
protracted litigation.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This board has decided to violate state law, violate the
provisions of their lease with the City of New York, and more
importantly violate the bylaws that they operate under,'' said
Lhota, who attended Tuesday's meeting of the museum board along
with city Corporation Counsel Michael Hess. Museum director Arnold
Lehman gave one indication of the museum's newly aggressive posture
when he politely but firmly evicted Hess and Lhota from a podium in
the museum's lobby, where they had paused after the board meeting
to answer reporter's questions. A short time later, Hess summed up
the rising emotions on both sides in a conversation with three
officials outside City Hall. ``We've got a big mess,'' he said.
``We've got World War III now.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, other religious and cultural organizations
joined the fray, staking out positions in a fight rich with
political implications for Giuliani's expected Senate race against
Hillary Rodham Clinton, as well as with legal implications for
publicly-funded art institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting the mayor was the Orthodox Union, the nation's
largest association of orthodox Jewish organizations, which issued
a statement Tuesday condemning the exhibit, especially a
dung-stained portrait of the Virgin Mary by the acclaimed British
artist Chris Ofili. ''Displaying a religious symbol splattered with
dung is deeply offensive and can hardly be said to have any
redeeming social or artistic value,'' the organization said.
``Today the offense is perpetrated against a Christian symbol;
tomorrow it might be a Jewish ritual item, and then of another
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Backing the museum was the Cultural Institutions Group, made up
of 33 city museums and arts organizations, which sent a letter to
the mayor Tuesday warning that his actions will have a ``chilling
effect'' on all city-funded museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation that New York City's government-assisted
institutions must make sure that city officials find inoffensive
every future exhibition or performance would cause lasting damage,
not only to the Brooklyn Museum of Art , but to all of our cultural
institutions, and to our City,'' said the letter, which was signed
by such leading cultural figures as Philippe de Montebello,
director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Glenn Lowry,
director of the Modern Museum of Art.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifteen years after the court-supervised breakup of AT&AMP;T, a part
of the old Ma Bell stands a good chance of being allowed to offer
customers both long-distance and local service.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Corp., the nation's biggest local telephone
company, plans to ask federal regulators, perhaps as soon as
Wednesday, for permission to sell long-distance communications
services in New York state. Approval would make it the first Baby
Bell to enter the $80 billion long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission has rejected five previous
long-distance applications from other Bell companies, saying they
had not yet opened their local networks to competition, as required
by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. But many communications
executives, analysts and lawyers expect Bell Atlantic's imminent
New York application to be approved.
</P>
<P>
   For the 6.6 million New York households served by Bell Atlantic,
approval could mean one-stop shopping for local and long-distance
phone service for the first time since AT&AMP;T Corp.'s break-up in
1984. In addition to offering pricing plans competitive with those
of the established long-distance giants, Bell Atlantic could also
offer special deals like discounted pricing for local service to
consumers who sign up for the company's long-distance product. Bell
Atlantic's entry into the long-distance market could put additional
downward pressure on long-distance prices, which are already in a
cycle of decline.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC declined to comment. But John Nakahata, who was chief of
staff for the commission's chairman, William Kennard, until last
winter, said, ``I think that there's a sense at the commission that
it's getting close to being time to let a Bell into long
distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakahata added, ``Assuming they have the support of New York
regulators, I think they'll get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they say that Bell Atlantic does not deserve to win
long-distance entry, some of Bell Atlantic's potential
long-distance competitors, including AT&AMP;T, also say the petition
will probably pass muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd put the chances above 50-50,'' said Michael Morrissey,
vice president for government affairs at AT&AMP;T, which stands to lose
billions in revenue if the Baby Bells broadly enter the
long-distance market. ``The other applications had no real
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic's application would apply only to New York state,
whose $7 billion long-distance market is one of the nation's most
attractive for communications companies. But if the petition is
approved, New York will probably set a regulatory tone for much of
the rest of the nation, with other Bells in other states looking to
Bell Atlantic's New York experience for guidance on how to gain
access to the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on track for a filing this week,'' said James Cullen,
president and chief operating officer of Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   If Bell Atlantic wins long-distance approval, it would open a
vast new front in the brutal wars of marketing and technology that
have roiled the communications business since passage of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, a law that was intended to
eliminate many barriers among various communications sectors.
</P>
<P>
   The act set off a frantic dash among the nation's communications
giants to assemble comprehensive baskets of local, long-distance,
wireless and Internet services to be offered to consumers as
one-stop communications solutions, making it less likely that
consumers will divide service among several companies. In that
vein, AT&AMP;T Corp., the No. 1 long-distance carrier, has committed
more than $90 billion to enter local communications markets by
acquiring two big cable companies, Tele-Communications Inc. and
Mediaone Group Inc., and retooling its network to piggyback local
phone service and Internet access on TV cables.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, none of the local Bells has won entry to the
long-distance market. Before that can happen, the FCC must certify
that a Bell has met a highly technical checklist included in the
1996 act to ensure that it has opened its local network to
competitors. Between the breakup of Ma Bell in 1984 and passage of
the act, the Bells were completely barred from the long-distance
market.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of many communications experts, Bell Atlantic's
strategy for winning long-distance approval has been more patient _
and potentially more effective _ than those of the other Bells.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, which acquired Nynex Corp. in 1997 and has since
agreed to merge with GTE Corp., has spent more than a year slogging
through a tough review by the New York Public Service Commission
and the Justice Department. In April 1998, Bell Atlantic struck a
deal under which the Public Service Commission and the Justice
Department would support Bell Atlantic's long-distance aspirations
in New York after the company had completed a set of network tests.
</P>
<P>
   But those tests took longer and uncovered more problems than
perhaps any of the parties had expected. At the time of the deal,
Bell Atlantic said it hoped to be in the long-distance market in
New York by the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other applicant to date has gone through the type of
testing that Bell Atlantic has done,'' said Nakahata, the former
FCC chief of staff who is now &UR;  &LR; a partner at the Washington law firm
of Harris, Wiltshire &AMP; Grannis. ``The fight will be over whether
the performance is good enough, but it is clear that the testing is
far beyond what anyone else has done.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear, however, whether the New York regulators are
satisfied. If they were to oppose the application, it would stand
almost no chance with the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   But after spending a year longer than expected meeting the
demands of New York regulators, it would be a big surprise if Bell
Atlantic had not received at least a tacit nod from the New York
commission to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the telecommunications law was passed, New York has seemed
like a natural candidate to be the first state to allow a Baby Bell
to offer long-distance service because so many competitive
local-exchange companies (known as CLECs and pronounced SEE-leks)
have made the state a target. Among others, MCI Worldcom Inc. has
signed up about 160,000 residential customers in New York, while
AT&AMP;T has about 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Bell Atlantic decided to do is strike deals _ deals with
the FCC, with the New York commission, with the CLECs,'' said Reed
Hundt, a former chairman of the FCC who is now a consultant for
McKinsey &AMP; Co. ``And this diplomatic strategy is going to get them
into long-distance in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York commission declined to comment. The FCC also
declined to comment, but people close to the commission
acknowledged that it would be under intense pressure to approve the
application to show that the telecommunications law is producing
competition almost four years after its passage. Some members of
Congress have criticized the commission for not moving more quickly
to approve long-distance applications.
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications Inc. is within weeks or months of applying
for long-distance in Texas, and people close to the commission
added that the FCC might prefer to give its first approval to Bell
Atlantic because the New York regulators have set a higher bar for
opening the incumbent's network than have the Texas regulators.
</P>
<P>
   After the application is filed, the commission will have 90 days
to review it. During that time, the lobbying battle will be
intense, with the long-distance giants doing their best to have the
petition denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a practical matter, Bell Atlantic isn't ready in New
York,'' said Jonathan Sallet, MCI Worldcom's chief policy counsel.
``At the current time, the facts show that the systems that have to
work don't yet work.''

CIA TURNS TO SILICON VALLEY FOR HELP IN DEVELOPING NEW
TECHNOLOGIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Hoping to insure that the nation's spies
have the latest information technology in the rapidly changing
Internet age, the CIA has established a venture capital company to
nurture high-technology companies, company executives and former
CIA officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has chosen a veteran Silicon Valley software executive
to head the effort, which has an office in Washington with eight
employees and will have a second office in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   With a nod to nostalgia for the mythic gadget-laden spycraft of
the James Bond era, the agency has named its new nonprofit venture
In-Q-it, in a reference to Major Boothroyd, aka Q, the master
technologist whose basement laboratory develops advanced gadgets
for the fictional British super-agent. It will be headed by Gilman
Louie, an executive in the Hasbro toy company's on-line business
group.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the nation's spy agency to turn to Silicon
Valley for technology assistance underscores the growing diversity
of high-tech companies and the accelerated development of computer
technologies. Unlike the cold war period, when the most advanced
technologies trickled down from a handful of supercomputer
companies, increasingly the most powerful technologies are being
developed first by consumer electronics companies which now have
vast markets to finance the developments of powerful systems and
applications.
</P>
<P>
   In-Q-It is being financed with $28 million appropriated last
year by Congress as part of the CIA's budget, which is classified.
The new company will seek out joint projects and investments in key
technology areas the agency is interested in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous information explosion today,'' said John
McMahon, former deputy director of the CIA and an In-Q-It board
member. ``As a result, the ageny was always one step behind. The
agency got the idea that maybe what it needed was something that
would not only appreciate its needs but be an umbilical cord that
was plugged in to the brightest minds in the Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Louie said on Tuesday that the purpose of the new company would
be to move information technology to the agency more quickly than
traditional government procurement processes allow. He said the
agency was struggling with many of the same aspects of the Internet
that are vexing to other Web surfers, including privacy and
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current model isn't working,'' Louie said. ``The
technology world has totally changed, and one day the CIA woke up
and realized they needed to go through the same change.''
</P>
<P>
   The new company will supply venture capital in some cases, and
in others it will hire contractors or partner with entrepreneurs in
four areas: integrating Internet technology and applications into
the CIA's work; developing new security and privacy technologies;
nurturing data mining technologies to take better advantage of the
agency's vast storehouses of records, and modernizing the agency's
now-dated computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Louie said that none of In-Q-It's work would be classified and
that the organization would not be limited to the four major areas
he outlined. He added that in contrast to many of its other
activities, the agency was taking pains to make the activities of
In-Q-It highly visible and public.
</P>
<P>
   That stands in striking contrast to the agency's approach to
high technology projects in the past. For many years there have
been reports that the U.S. intelligence community created shell
companies when it had a particular high-technology problem to
solve.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA worked secretly with Howard Hughes during the 1970s when
it needed to develop specialized salvage technology to retrieve a
sunken Soviet nuclear submarine in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   While In-Q-It will operate on a nonprofit basis, Louie said his
intention was to invest in such a way as to make the organization
ultimately self sustaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we'll knock the cover off the ball,'' he said.
``That's exactly what we want.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey H. Smith, the new company's legal counsel and former
general counsel to the CIA, said, ``The government will have the
opportunity to use the the intellectual property developed by
In-Q-It for governmental purposes, but In-Q-It will own and have
the ability to use the technology it develops for commercial
purposes.'`
</P>
<P>
   Louie said that while this was not the first effort to find
innovative ways to move new technologies quickly to the
government's needs, he believed it was the first time a government
agency had adopted a venture financing effort that mimicked a
private sector model.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists said on Tuesday that the problem the CIA
faces is a challenge faced every day by large organizations
generally: attempting to keep up with the nimble pace of the
Valley's technology start-up companies.
</P>
<P>
   A number of large multinational companies have in recent years
set up investment funds in the Valley in an effort to tap into the
entrepreneurial spirit of the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of models on which the jury is still out,''
said James Breyer, managing partner of Accel Partners, a Palo Alto,
Calif.-based venture firm.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Lucent Technologies and AT&AMP;T Corp. have become
venture investors in the Valley in recent years, he noted, and SRI
Research International had less success in attempting to spin out
its research projects with an internal venture arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important aspect is to have an outstanding outside
management effort overseeing the process,'' he said. ``It appears
in this effort the CIA has chosen well.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Previous government efforts at financing technology have been
highly focused efforts to promote the development of specific
technologies either needed to keep the nation competitive or to
meet national security needs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, during the 1970s through 1990s various military
research agencies like the Defense Advanced Research Projects
agency and the Office of Naval Research financed academic and
corporate projects not as investments but as contract research.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s the government financed the Sematech computer
consortium in an effort to maintain an independent semiconductor
equipment industry in the United States, which was being threatened
by Japanese and European competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Louie, who is 39, said on Tuesday that he would work on both
coasts and was now looking for an office in Silicon Valley. He said
that he had become involved in the new company accidentally after
meeting a headhunter from Heidrick &AMP; Struggles at a mock-aerial
dogfighting contest earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Louie is a lifelong computer gaming aficianado who a year ago
sold Microprose, his computer gaming company, to Hasbro. He has
been a well-known figure in the Silicon Valley software world since
creating his first computer gaming company while he was a student
at San Francisco State University in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new company's board members are John Seeley Brown,
director Xerox Corp.'s Palo Alto Research Center; Lee Ault,
director of Equifax Alex Brown; Stephen Friedman of Goldman Sachs;
Norm Augustine, chairman of Lockheed Martin Corp., and William
Perry, the former secretary of defense.

BRADLEY PROPOSES OPENING FEDERAL EMPLOYEE HEALTH PLAN TO ALL
AMERICANS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Seeking to sharpen the few policy differences in
the Democratic presidential race, former Sen. Bill Bradley proposed
Tuesday to open the federal employee health plan to all Americans
so that children can be guaranteed medical care and adults
encouraged to seek coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Laying out a key plank in his bid against Vice President Al
Gore, Bradley suggested making the Federal Employee Health Benefit
Plan the nation's medical insurer of last resort. If adopted, the
proposal could quickly balloon an enterprise that currently covers
9 million Americans _ including members of Congress _ through 400
private insurance plans and make it the standard by which most
medical benefit programs are judged, designed and priced.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's plan would require parents to enroll an infant in a
health care plan, perhaps at the same time they apply for a birth
certificate, and maintain coverage until age 19. The proposal
spells out no enforcement mechanism, and Bradley said he would
``trust in the basic goodness'' of Americans. An aide said: ``No
one's going to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Adults would not be required to enroll in a health plan, but
Bradley's proposal is designed to move toward almost total coverage
without the political firestorm that met President Clinton's
attempt at universal health insurance early in his term. Bradley
said that his proposal, combined with existing plans, would result
in health care coverage for 95 percent of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he was putting forward the plan because ``we can't
afford not to provide health care to our children.'' Uninsured
adults, he said, should be allowed to ``enroll in one of the many
private plans now available to only members of Congress and other
federal employees.''
</P>
<P>
   With its implication of breaking into an exclusive realm of
politicians and bureaucrats, the comment was a sure-fire applause
line in Bradley's speech at Los Angeles Valley College. The address
was delivered as polls show Bradley gaining on Gore, especially in
early voting New Hampshire, where the two former Senate colleagues
are in a statistical dead heat. Both candidates are from the broad
center-left of their party and seem to have few substantive
differences on major government policies.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's health-care proposal differs from Gore's in that it
would provide explicit access to the federal employee's plan. Three
weeks ago, Gore made a broad pledge, with few details, to ensure
health-care coverage for all children by 2005, the year the next
presidential term ends. That's also when Bradley aides said their
candidate's plan was intended to be fully effective.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, speaking to reporters after his speech, renewed his
charge that Gore relied on ``incrementalism'' in approaching major
issues such as health care and recalled his own campaign-opening
pledge to seek to make government do ``a few big things well'' and
comprehensively.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a former basketball star who represented New Jersey in
the Senate for 18 years, said that Gore's health care proposal ``is
definitely timid when compared to what we have proposed.'' In his
formal remarks, Bradley, alluding to Gore's approach, said, ``a
campaign proposal without a price tag is just another politician's
promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley predicted his proposal would cost $50 million-$65
million in its first year. He said he the new plan would be funded
from non-Social Security federal budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   He brushed aside questions about whether new taxes would be
required to finance the program if there were an economic downturn,
saying: ``We're in a surplus world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign charged that Bradley's plan would leave ``other
critical programs unfunded'' and provided ``not one dime'' for
ensuring the future of Medicare. Bradley said that because the
Medicare system is secure through 2018 and health care is changing
so quickly he proposed waiting a year or two before proceeding with
alterations in the major national health plan for the elderly. He
said he was unlikely to propose reforms to the program during his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides also said that by opening the federal employee plan,
Bradley's proposal could cause employers to drop current coverage.
Bradley said he did not agree with the vice president's point but
would have to review whether employers should be prohibited from or
penalized for cutting off current plans and attempting to herd
workers into the newly available federal program.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's plan also envisions a phase-out of many Medicaid
features, as the poor currently in the program would, in effect, be
transferred to the federal employees' plan. In exchange, states
would have to take over responsibility for providing institutional
long-term care for the poor, including nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley aides said states now pay $56 billion annually as their
share of Medicaid payments and that the long-term care requirement
would cost only $38 billion, an estimated $18 billion in savings.
Like many parts of the Bradley proposal, cost estimates were far
from exact and based only on a one-year outlay, without figuring
for long-term escalating costs.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley argued that the future does not necessarily hold
increased outlays for medical care, claiming instead, ``We're just
at the beginning of revolutionary cost savings.''
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Bradley said, his proposal should be seen as ``a
starting point, not a final plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The former senator proposed unlimited federal tax deductibility
of health care premiums paid by individuals and promised to retain
the current provision that employer contributions to health
insurance are treated as non-taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who in Congress argued for simplifying the federal tax
code, said special treatment of health care premiums was merited
because ``this is a big and important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Bradley's plan, children could be added to parents'
existing coverage, most likely an employer's plan, or enter the
federal employees' plan. The federal government would fully pay the
health care cost of families living in poverty, currently a family
of four with no more than $16,400 in annual income. Partial
subsidies would be available, on a sliding scale, for more
prosperous families, up to a family of four with an annual income
of almost $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The subsidies would come through federal income tax rebates
available before the premium was due.
</P>
<P>
   Although adults would not be required to secure coverage,
Americans at least 20-64 years old could buy into the federal
employee plan at existing group rates. All poor would be covered
through the tax subsidy program, and adults in families of four
with annual income up to $32,800 would be partially subsidized.
</P>
<P>
   Plans in the government program would be required to offer
coverage regardless of a person's existing medical problems.
Bradley has demonstrated he knows the appeal of health care as a
national issue, especially when couched in terms of breaking down
walls of privilege _ such as his proposal to open a system now
available to members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Bradley returned to a similar point he has made
earlier in his campaign. He said it was wrong that ``kings and
dictators can come to the country to get the best medical care in
the world while Americans two blocks away may not be able to afford
any care at all. The time has come to right these wrongs in our
health care system.''

KID CRAFTS FOR THE FALL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, we know. Halloween is still a month away, but it's not too
early to get into the autumn spirit with some family craft
activities for the weekends ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Here are three of our favorites: one for the very young, one
appropriate for more steady hands, and one that even older kids
will find cool.
</P>
<P>
   Start now and enjoy them through October.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   1. Leaf rubbings
</P>
<P>
   Appropriate for: preschoolers
</P>
<P>
   You'll need: leaves, paper, chalk or pencil
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Leaf rubbings are a good way to introduce small children to
celebrating fall _ and you can turn the project into a fun outing,
if you want to head to a park to gather leaves. Find a number of
fall leaves, keeping an eye out for those with lots of veining or
texture. Put the leaves on a flat surface, place paper over them,
and rub over them with chalk or a pencil. Make room on the
refrigerator for your autumn art.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   2. Halloween luminarias
</P>
<P>
   Appropriate for: ages 6-8
</P>
<P>
   You'll need: paper bags, scissors, sand or gravel, votive
candles and holders
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Kids will enjoy making luminarias to decorate the front porch or
walkway for a spooky Halloween look.
</P>
<P>
   Draw simple geometric patterns on paper lunch bags or white
paper bags. Cut along the borders of the designs. (Kids with more
advanced skills can create stencils of jack-o'-lanterns, witches
and ghosts.) Fill the bags with enough sand or gravel to weigh them
down. Put a votive candle (in a small holder) into the sand, and
set the luminarias out in the yard. Be careful _ remember the fire
risk. Be sure the paper bag is away from the candle, and never
leave the candle burning unattended. Or, to help reduce the risk,
buy bags treated to make them fire-resistant. You can find these in
the seasonal department at craft or home stores; we found them at
Garden Ridge stores.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   3. Flying ghosts
</P>
<P>
   Appropriate for: age 8 and older
</P>
<P>
   You'll need: 15-inch square of fine mesh screen (one for each
ghost), spray mount adhesive, 17-inch square of white tissue paper
for each ghost, glue, a sewing needle, clear monofilament, and
sequins, buttons, wiggle eyes or other decorations
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   We found these flying ghosts in ``Halloween Treats,'' a craft
and recipe book by Donata Maggipinto.
</P>
<P>
   To make them, apply spray adhesive to a fine mesh screen, then
place a sheet of tissue paper on top and smooth it down.
</P>
<P>
   To make the ghost's head, make a fist, place the screen over it
and mold it to your hand. Then mold the screen to form the rest of
the ghost _ arms and body. Decorate your ghost with sequins or
buttons, placing eyes on it if you wish.
</P>
<P>
   To hang your ghost: Thread monofilament through a needle, then
bring the needle up through the head from the body of the ghost.
When you hang it from the ceiling or a doorway, the monofilament
will disappear and the ghost will seem to float.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A century after the tribal devastation of the
Indian wars, a place of honor on the capital Mall was finally
extended to the nation's Native Americans on Tuesday as
construction began on a museum that Indian leaders vowed would
celebrate their history of indomitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we return to a native place now known as Washington,''
said W. Richard West, a Cheyenne who is director of the new
National Museum of the American Indian, presiding at a ceremony
driven by exuberant drumbeats but sober reflection, too, at the
Indians' near annihilation in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still here,'' Chief Billy Redwing Tayac of the
Piscataway tribe exulted in his blessing, drawing whoops as he cast
sacred burial ground soil on the museum site at the foot of Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of tribal members and chiefs in attendance
savoring ancient ritual and hopeful speeches, the museum, scheduled
to open in 2002, was hailed as a long overdue antidote to centuries
of racist stereotyping, broken land treaties and federal
``civilization regulations'' that failed to rein in rich tribal
cultures with a policy of assimilation.
</P>
<P>
   The $110 million museum of cliff-like Kasota limestone _ the
Smithsonian Institution's 10th and final showplace museum on the
Mall _ will be a culturally busy five-story center dedicated to the
story of more than 1,000 Native American communities in the Western
Hemisphere, from the Arctic Circle to Tierra del Fuego, from
Indians' lethal struggles of the past to those of the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a story that the museum has to tell,'' Suzan Shown
Harjo, an Indian leader and scholar, insisted at a spirited seminar
on Monday night of Indian leaders envisioning a place that
participants said should be part Louvre, part Holocaust Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Under the congressional authorization, the federal government is
financing two-thirds of the cost and the museum the other third _ a
$36.7 million fund that has already been raised by 250,000 private
and corporate donors, Smithsonian officials said. Part of the
tribal visitors' pride was rooted in the fact that the largest
single donation _ $10 million _ was made by the Mashantucket Pequot
nation of Connecticut, which has become the model for a renaissance
by tribes using their sovereignty to create gambling casinos across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   If the speeches of three days of celebration are any guide, the
museum, which will be run by a 25-member board, including 16
American Indians, will not only celebrate and display continuing
tribal cultures but work to set the record straight. How possible
disputes among historians might be settled ``remains to be seen,''
said Thomas W. Sweeney, a museum spokesman. He noted that the
museum was dedicated to presentations ``from the native
perspective'' and that others were free to disagree.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's goal will be ``to show and tell the world who and
what we really are and to use our own voices in the telling,''
West, the museum director, emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they underlined such continuing problems as poverty and
teen-age suicide, the Indian leaders hailed gradual recovery and
growth and the museum's potential to be ``a cleansing and a
blessing at the same time,'' in the words of Ines Hernandez-Avila,
an Indian cultural expert at the University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   In their celebration, visiting chiefs and scholars honored the
tribes' very survival, from 250,000 native Americans a century ago
_ a 95 percent withering from their pre-Colonial heyday _ to more
than two million now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great, Indians are having more babies!'' Ms. Harjo told the
seminar. ``We native people in this room and all over are here
because many white men couldn't kill all our ancestors,'' she
added, exemplifying the militant pride that energized the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at history, Kevin Gover, head of the Federal Bureau
of Indian Affairs, a Pawnee and a law professor at Yale, told the
seminar, ``The most powerful and richest nation in the world
literally turned its guns on us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see out there right now,'' Gover added, is the legacy
of ``a great deal of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the very greatest enemy the tribes have at this
point,'' he said in celebrating the ``survival culture'' that the
new museum is to explain to the nation at large. At least six
million visitors a year are anticipated at the museum, which is
being built just east of the National Air and Space Museum, the
city's busiest, with eight million tourists annually.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal leaders emphasized their long struggle ``to get our dead
relatives out of museums'' of the past that had confiscated sacred
relics and celebrated only the supposed ``end-of-the-trail'' defeat
of the tribes, as one of them put it.
</P>
<P>
   By way of contrast, tribal members focused on the priceless
artifacts to be displayed in the National Museum's centerpiece
collection, the ``magnificent obsession'' of George Gustav Heye,
the turn-of-the-century collector who searched out art and homespun
artifacts from the tribes, West noted, with the passion of a
``boxcar collector.'' Heye's old Indian museum at Broadway and
155th Street in Manhattan, overlooked across the years, is a
seedbed for the new National Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian has had the George Gustav Heye Center open to
the public in lower Manhattan for the past five years. This will
continue along with the new museum and a cultural resources center
that the Smithsonian has opened in Suitland, Md., six miles from
Washington, where much of the Heye collection of more than 800,000
artifacts is being transferred from storage in New York to be
available for Indian scholars.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian attributed the concept for the museum, which
will have a 120-foot-high copper dome and cantilevered design, to
GBQC Architects of Philadelphia in association with Douglas
Cardinal, a noted Canadian architect of Blackfoot ancestry.
Cardinal had been dismissed as the original architect in 1998
because of delays and contractual disputes.

COURT TO RULE ON PATIENT'S RIGHT TO SUE HMO OVER COST-CONTROL
EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Pa., Ga.)   (bl)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday assigned itself an
important role in the debate over managed health care, accepting a
case on whether an Illinois health maintenance organization
breached a legal duty to a patient whose appendix burst during an
eight-day wait for a test to diagnose her abdominal pain.
</P>
<P>
   The question in the case is whether the HMO's financial
structure, under which doctors' compensation depended in part on
their success in holding down costs, meant that its patients' best
interests did not come first, as required under a federal appeals
court's interpretation of the federal law governing
employer-sponsored health plans.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of health-care industry and other business groups
urged the court to review the August 1998 ruling by a panel of the
7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. The decision has broad
implications for managed care generally, because cost-containment
strategies that may limit a patient's options are the essence of
this approach to health care. The 2-1 ruling reinstated, but did
not resolve, a lawsuit that has yet to go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under this decision, any cost-savings achieved by managed care
would be lost,'' lawyers for the HMO, Health Alliance Medical Plans
of Urbana, Ill., told the justices. The statement echoed one made
by a judge on the appeals court, Frank Easterbrook, in arguing
unsuccessfully on behalf of four of the court's 12 judges that the
case should get a new hearing by the full court. Under the panel's
ruling, ``the principal organizational forms through which medical
care is delivered today are unlawful,'' Easterbrook wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The 7th Circuit based its ruling on a 1974 federal law, the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which governs employee
benefits such as pensions and medical care. The law, known as
ERISA, operates as a barrier to many lawsuits that would otherwise
proceed in state court, leading to the focus of the current debate,
both in Congress and in the states, on expanding patients' rights
to sue. Some 160 million people receive medical coverage through
their employment.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, the 7th Circuit used ERISA not as a
shield for health care providers but as a sword for aggrieved
patients. The court said that health maintenance organizations and
their doctors are bound by a duty under one of ERISA'S provisions
to act as fiduciaries, that is, to act ``solely in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries'' of an employer-provided
medical plan. By rewarding doctors for holding down costs, the
court said, the HMO may have placed doctors' interests in conflict
with the interests of their patients.
</P>
<P>
   While the precise holding of the 7th Circuit was unusual, the
decision was part of a trend in which courts have been finding ways
around obstacles to patients in employer-sponsored health plans
receiving redress for their injuries. An appeal by a Pennsylvania
HMO from a ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is awaiting
action by the justices.
</P>
<P>
   The court will not hear the Illinois case, Pegram vs. Herdrich,
No. 98-1949, until January, and will probably not decide it until
well into next spring. Next week, meanwhile, the House of
Representatives is to take up several competing measures that would
expand patients' rights to varying degrees. The Senate passed a
Republican-sponsored bill earlier this year, which President
Clinton vowed to veto as offering no more than ``toothless,
half-hearted protections.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is unusual for the court to inject itself into the
midst of an active legislative debate, the justices were evidently
persuaded that the 7th Circuit's approach is potentially of such
dimension that it should not be left to stand unreviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision by the court to accept the case will not
alter the debate in Congress, top Democratic and Republican aides
said. ``If anything, this will provide added impetus on this
issue,'' said John Stone, a spokesman for Rep. Charlie Norwood,
R-Ga., a sponsor of bipartisan legislation that would expand
patients' right to sue health care providers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his majority opinion for the 7th Circuit panel, Judge John
Coffey noted that ``a response to the crisis in market-based care
has come to roost in Washington, D.C.,'' and spoke in scathing
terms of ``the deleterious effects of managed care on the health
care industry.'' The majority opinion was joined by Judge
Harlington Wood. In a dissenting opinion, Judge Joel Flaum said
that although he shared the majority's concerns, judges should not
``preempt legislative and regulatory efforts in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff in this case, Cynthia Herdrich, received her
medical care through the Urbana HMO, which operates as the Carle
Clinic, under her husband's health care plan. In March 1991, she
complained of abdominal pain and was examined by one of the
clinic's doctors, Lori Pegram. Dr. Pegram found that Mrs.
Herdrich's appendix was inflamed, but told her she would have to
wait eight days for an ultrasound examination before the procedure
could be performed by the HMO staff. Mrs. Herdrich's appendix burst
while she was waiting for her appointment, leading to peritonitis
and a more complicated and dangerous medical situation than a
simple removal of her appendix.
</P>
<P>
   She sued and won $35,000 in compensatory damages under Illinois
medical malpractice law. But a U.S. District Court dismissed the
portion of her suit that was based on ERISA and that claimed that
the HMO had breached its fiduciary duty. It was this aspect of the
suit that the 7th Circuit reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   A group of health-care industry trade associations, along with
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, filed a brief urging the Supreme
Court to take the case. The brief said the 7th Circuit majority had
displayed an ``anti-managed bias'' that ``should not be allowed to
override the carefully considered decision of the legislative and
executive branches to promote the prudent and effective management
of health plans.''

 &HT;    Some left in a huff as bike company rides off into sunset
 &HT;    By Lynn Hulsey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Huffy Corp.'s decision to close the last of its
American bicycle and parts manufacturing plants has officials in
the two affected cities asking themselves, ``What happened?''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Don Graber, Huffy's top executive, said it's
time to focus on the future rather than Huffy's announcement Monday
that it would close its Farmington, Mo., bike plant and a year-old
Southaven, Miss., bike parts plant. The decision will cost 600
people their jobs and Huffy bikes will be made by foreign suppliers
not owned by the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to close the bicycle plants ... was an agonizing,
difficult decision. But basically we had no alternative,'' said
Graber, blaming competition from Chinese manufacturers who make and
sell bikes at a lower price than Huffy.
</P>
<P>
   He said the decision was made on the recommendation of Huffy
Bicycle Co. managers and closure was the only alternative presented
to Graber and the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, when we closed (the) Celina (bike plant) over a
year ago we had hoped to maintain a U.S. manufacturing base,'' said
Graber, Huffy's chairman, president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But for Farmington Mayor Kevin Engler and Southaven City
Administrator Chris Wilson the high hopes they had when Huffy came
to their communities have been dashed. Their focus now switches to
finding new tenants in the buildings leased by Huffy and in helping
find jobs for 600 people who earned on average $12 hourly in wages
and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed in the closing,'' said Engler. ``I realize
that Huffy is attributing it to a lot of overseas imports and
that's probably true. At the same time there has to be some
mismanagement.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as early summer Huffy officials in Farmington talked
about adding lines to produce more bikes, he said. He's stunned the
company would have moved some of Farmington's parts production to
Southaven, spent money equipping that plant, only to close it less
than a year later.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm on the board, wouldn't I be saying, 'Who's steering
this ship?' `` Engler said.
</P>
<P>
   Graber denied Huffy's problems are because of mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our strongest management teams is in the bicycle
business. The issue with bicycles is not a leadership issue or a
people issue,'' Graber said.
</P>
<P>
   The Southaven plant, which forms and shapes forks, frames and
handlebars for the Farmington plant, was touted as a $10 million
investment at the time it was announced in June 1998. Tom
Frederick, chief financial officer, said that number is probably
somewhat inflated but he did not know the exact investment. He said
the Farmington plant, opened in 1994, cost $24 million. Huffy will
take a pre-tax cost for plant closures and other related charges of
about $42.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Graber also elaborated on the company's decision to hire
investment banker PaineWebber to determine over the next 45 to 60
days if the company should be merged, sold, spun off or involved in
joint ventures with other companies. The goal is to improve
shareholder return on their investment in Huffy. Huffy (NYSE:HUF)
stock values dropped 49 percent between January and Monday, when
stock prices hit a 52-week low of 8 1/2. On Tuesday, prices
recovered slightly to close at 9 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the marketplace is still digesting the announcement,''
Graber said. ``Obviously a second restructuring in 16 months takes
time for the market to digest.''

<P>
   Fifteen years after the court-supervised breakup of AT&AMP;T, a part
of the old Ma Bell stands a good chance of being allowed to offer
customers both long-distance and local service.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Corp., the nation's biggest local telephone
company, plans to ask federal regulators, perhaps as soon as
Wednesday, for permission to sell long-distance communications
services in New York state. Approval would make it the first Baby
Bell to enter the $80 billion long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission has rejected five previous
long-distance applications from other Bell companies, saying they
had not yet opened their local networks to competition, as required
by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. But many communications
executives, analysts and lawyers expect Bell Atlantic's imminent
New York application to be approved.
</P>
<P>
   For the 6.6 million New York households served by Bell Atlantic,
approval could mean one-stop shopping for local and long-distance
phone service for the first time since AT&AMP;T Corp.'s break-up in
1984. In addition to offering pricing plans competitive with those
of the established long-distance giants, Bell Atlantic could also
offer special deals like discounted pricing for local service to
consumers who sign up for the company's long-distance product. Bell
Atlantic's entry into the long-distance market could put additional
downward pressure on long-distance prices, which are already in a
cycle of decline.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC declined to comment. But John Nakahata, who was chief of
staff for the commission's chairman, William Kennard, until last
winter, said, ``I think that there's a sense at the commission that
it's getting close to being time to let a Bell into long
distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakahata added, ``Assuming they have the support of New York
regulators, I think they'll get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they say that Bell Atlantic does not deserve to win
long-distance entry, some of Bell Atlantic's potential
long-distance competitors, including AT&AMP;T, also say the petition
will probably pass muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd put the chances above 50-50,'' said Michael Morrissey,
vice president for government affairs at AT&AMP;T, which stands to lose
billions in revenue if the Baby Bells broadly enter the
long-distance market. ``The other applications had no real
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic's application would apply only to New York state,
whose $7 billion long-distance market is one of the nation's most
attractive for communications companies. But if the petition is
approved, New York will probably set a regulatory tone for much of
the rest of the nation, with other Bells in other states looking to
Bell Atlantic's New York experience for guidance on how to gain
access to the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on track for a filing this week,'' said James Cullen,
president and chief operating officer of Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   If Bell Atlantic wins long-distance approval, it would open a
vast new front in the brutal wars of marketing and technology that
have roiled the communications business since passage of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, a law that was intended to
eliminate many barriers among various communications sectors.
</P>
<P>
   The act set off a frantic dash among the nation's communications
giants to assemble comprehensive baskets of local, long-distance,
wireless and Internet services to be offered to consumers as
one-stop communications solutions, making it less likely that
consumers will divide service among several companies. In that
vein, AT&AMP;T Corp., the No. 1 long-distance carrier, has committed
more than $90 billion to enter local communications markets by
acquiring two big cable companies, Tele-Communications Inc. and
Mediaone Group Inc., and retooling its network to piggyback local
phone service and Internet access on TV cables.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, none of the local Bells has won entry to the
long-distance market. Before that can happen, the FCC must certify
that a Bell has met a highly technical checklist included in the
1996 act to ensure that it has opened its local network to
competitors. Between the breakup of Ma Bell in 1984 and passage of
the act, the Bells were completely barred from the long-distance
market.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of many communications experts, Bell Atlantic's
strategy for winning long-distance approval has been more patient _
and potentially more effective _ than those of the other Bells.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, which acquired Nynex Corp. in 1997 and has since
agreed to merge with GTE Corp., has spent more than a year slogging
through a tough review by the New York Public Service Commission
and the Justice Department. In April 1998, Bell Atlantic struck a
deal under which the Public Service Commission and the Justice
Department would support Bell Atlantic's long-distance aspirations
in New York after the company had completed a set of network tests.
</P>
<P>
   But those tests took longer and uncovered more problems than
perhaps any of the parties had expected. At the time of the deal,
Bell Atlantic said it hoped to be in the long-distance market in
New York by the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other applicant to date has gone through the type of
testing that Bell Atlantic has done,'' said Nakahata, the former
FCC chief of staff who is now &UR;  &LR; a partner at the Washington law firm
of Harris, Wiltshire &AMP; Grannis. ``The fight will be over whether
the performance is good enough, but it is clear that the testing is
far beyond what anyone else has done.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear, however, whether the New York regulators are
satisfied. If they were to oppose the application, it would stand
almost no chance with the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   But after spending a year longer than expected meeting the
demands of New York regulators, it would be a big surprise if Bell
Atlantic had not received at least a tacit nod from the New York
commission to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the telecommunications law was passed, New York has seemed
like a natural candidate to be the first state to allow a Baby Bell
to offer long-distance service because so many competitive
local-exchange companies (known as CLECs and pronounced SEE-leks)
have made the state a target. Among others, MCI Worldcom Inc. has
signed up about 160,000 residential customers in New York, while
AT&AMP;T has about 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Bell Atlantic decided to do is strike deals _ deals with
the FCC, with the New York commission, with the CLECs,'' said Reed
Hundt, a former chairman of the FCC who is now a consultant for
McKinsey &AMP; Co. ``And this diplomatic strategy is going to get them
into long-distance in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York commission declined to comment. The FCC also
declined to comment, but people close to the commission
acknowledged that it would be under intense pressure to approve the
application to show that the telecommunications law is producing
competition almost four years after its passage. Some members of
Congress have criticized the commission for not moving more quickly
to approve long-distance applications.
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications Inc. is within weeks or months of applying
for long-distance in Texas, and people close to the commission
added that the FCC might prefer to give its first approval to Bell
Atlantic because the New York regulators have set a higher bar for
opening the incumbent's network than have the Texas regulators.
</P>
<P>
   After the application is filed, the commission will have 90 days
to review it. During that time, the lobbying battle will be
intense, with the long-distance giants doing their best to have the
petition denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a practical matter, Bell Atlantic isn't ready in New
York,'' said Jonathan Sallet, MCI Worldcom's chief policy counsel.
``At the current time, the facts show that the systems that have to
work don't yet work.''

 &HT;    ACC salaries: Friedgen tops in assistant pay
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech offensive coordinator Ralph Friedgen
isn't a head coach, but he's paid like one.
</P>
<P>
   Friedgen is earning $200,000 this season, the same as head coach
George O'Leary and Virginia head coach George Welsh, and more than
the head coaches at four other ACC schools, according to a
leaguewide salary survey by The Atlanta Journal- Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Among the seven schools responding to the survey, the only head
coach making more than Friedgen is Florida State's Bobby Bowden at
$1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The salaries of all coaches at state-funded universities were
obtained through requests made to the schools and from state
Freedom of Information Act requests. Duke and Wake Forest, as
private universities, are not subject to state open-record laws,
and they refused requests for their coaches' salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Friedgen is the highest-paid assistant. His salary is more than
$63,000 higher than that of the next-highest paid next-highest-paid
assistant, FSU defensive coordinator Mickey Andrews ($136,985).
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Friedgen earned $82,500. He got the increase of 142.4
percent because of his years as an assistant to former Tech coach
Bobby Ross with the San Diego Chargers and the desire of Tech to
keep him on its staff.
</P>
<P>
   Friedgen was an assistant at Tech 1987-91, then followed Ross to
San Diego when Ross went there after the '91 season. When Ross left
the Chargers in 1997,
</P>
<P>
   his staff went as well, but not without an attractive severance
package. The bulk of Friedgen's income the past two years was from
the Chargers, and his Tech salary of $82,500 was part of the deal
to get him to return to the school. This year is the first the
Jackets have had to assume Friedgen's entire package.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to pay Ralph that (much) to get him to leave the pros
and come here,'' O'Leary said. ``That's about what a pro assistant
makes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for us to be competitive,'' athletics director
Dave Braine said. ``Is there a higher-paid assistant in the country
than Ralph? I don't think so. But I'll say that that's money well
spent. He's the best offensive coordinator in the nation, and when
you put George and Ralph and (defensive coordinator) Ted Roof
together, you've got the nucleus for a great staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Braine said he has a survey done by NCAA Division I athletics
directors and knows what every assistant makes. ``We keep up with
it,'' he said. ``I want our coaches to stay, and I want us to be
competitive in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech's staff is second to Florida State's in base compensation,
$1,830,591 to $1,044,077. Except for O'Leary and Friedgen, the Tech
staff was given a 4 percent raise this year. Faculty and
non-faculty employees at Tech also got a 4 percent raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our league is a little low on coaches' salaries,''
O'Leary said. ``I compare our staff's salaries to Georgia instead
of the other ACC teams. You have to look at the area you live in,
how much it costs to go out and eat, how much entertainment costs.
I want to make sure our coaches earn enough with the work and hours
they put in.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Donnan and his staff at Georgia make $1,057,785 this year.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary's coaches work an average of 55 hours Sunday through
Thursday, travel on Friday and work the game Saturday. ``If you
break it down by the hour,'' O'Leary said, ``they don't get paid
much.''

 NEW YORK: diplomatic implications. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rivals: Strong Contenders Battling Over Turf
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the turf war are legendary personalities and
longstanding rivalries between two of the most aggressive
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner stands Morgenthau, 80, the powerful district
attorney, whose unsuccessful prosecution of the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International earlier in this decade left federal agencies
suspect of his crusades against white-collar crime.
</P>
<P>
   In the other corner is Louis Freeh, 49, the hard-driving FBI
director. Freeh, who began his career as an FBI agent and federal
prosecutor in New York, has ample personal experience in the
often-tense relations between Morgenthau's office and the bureau's
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau has long viewed federal investigators, particularly
the FBI, to be slow-footed and timid in their pursuit of financial
criminals. The bureau considers Morgenthau an interloper who is
overzealous in his attempts to broaden his jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Morgenthau's jurisdiction is Manhattan, the
financial capital of the world, and that gives him powers greater
than a typical local law enforcement official's if a case revolves
around white-collar crime.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh has been anxious to broaden the bureau's authority as
well. He has expanded its presence overseas in an effort to counter
sophisticated international criminal networks that operate in the
United States. That expansion has irritated some Foreign Service
professionals, complicating matters for the bureau, which is often
perceived as arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes hold more than parochial interest. The Bank of New
York affair has already touched off a broad debate about American
policy on Russia, the role played by Western institutions in
perhaps facilitating corruption there, and how power is wielded in
an economically troubled country with stores of nuclear arms. The
investigation, and any facts it may uncover, touches on all of
these concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The Conduit: So Many Dollars, So Few Accounts
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the battle between Morgenthau and Freeh is Benex, a
mysterious money-moving company run by an equally elusive Russian
emigre named Peter Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1996 and August this year, Benex moved at least $7.5
billion from Russia through just nine accounts at the Bank of New
York, according to the bank. The bank has not been charged with
wrongdoing and its senior executives are not targets of the federal
investigation, according to law-enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Although the FBI has been sifting through reams of bank data for
about a year, the exact source of the funds remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say part of the money is from ordinary wire
transfers and tax-avoidance, much of which is perfectly legal in
Russia, while some may be tied to organized crime, corporate
embezzlement or political graft. Law-enforcement officials say that
proof of the latter can only be unearthed by Russian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit of Benex began in February 1998 when Morgenthau
convened a state grand jury and issued subpoenas in response to
British investigators who were seeking help in examining possible
money laundering through Benex.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a natural request. The British were looking into the
activities of a London law firm, Talbott, Creggy &AMP; Co., which had
set up offshore shell companies used to move money. Morgenthau was
examining the same law firm for its role in facilitating a New
York-based stock fraud.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Morgenthau asked the federal government for help.
But he did not speak with the FBI. Instead, he sent a memo to the
Customs Service noting that large sums of money with suspect
origins were flowing through Benex into accounts at the Bank of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The British and American inquiries focused on a Russian emigre
named Roman Amiragov, who, investigators said, may have been a
client of Talbott, Creggy. According to law enforcement officials,
Amiragov ran a company in Britain and the United States, called
Portrait Trading, that in early 1998 alone moved $300,000 to
$500,000 a week through Benex into the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about Amiragov. He and his family broke their
lease and abruptly left their Jersey City, N.J., apartment shortly
after the Bank of New York investigation became public in August.
Amiragov left the country but returned on Sept. 15. His current
whereabouts could not be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say Morgenthau's office did not see the Bank of New
York as an important part of its inquiry until very recently. The
office did not issue subpoenas to the Bank of New York until
shortly before the federal investigation burst into public view,
leading federal investigators to suggest that Morgenthau's office
is poaching.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, the FBI began following a separate trail toward
Benex and the Bank of New York. At the request of the Russian
government, the bureau looked into a kidnapping ransom paid to
organized crime figures through a Benex account at the Bank of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions about Benex deepened when another New York bank,
Republic Bank, reported to the federal government that it had
handled several suspicious transfers of money from Russia involving
Benex.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury was convened to handle the case in
September 1998, and the FBI approached the bank to secure its
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   This move was a calculated risk. In return for a chance to
monitor the flow of money through the accounts, the bureau assured
senior executives that they would not be targets of the
investigation, even though the bank's role in the matter was not
yet entirely clear.
</P>
<P>
   Bureau officials said their effort is now the biggest
money-laundering investigation in history. The dragnet, involving
dozens of agents and analysts examining more than 100 banks in
about 42 countries, is described by one federal law enforcement
official as ``an octopus.''

 NEW YORK: ``an octopus.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Word of the FBI's investigation began to spread. In October
1998, John Moscow, a prosecutor with the district attorney's
office, traveled to London to meet with the National Crime Squad.
Moscow, also a veteran of the failed BCCI prosecution _ and also
viewed dimly by the bureau, where he is thought of as a conspiracy
theorist _ heard a lot in London about apparent money-laundering at
the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow relayed what he had learned to Jonathan Winer, a
specialist in international crime at the State Department. Winer,
an ally of Morgenthau's office from the BCCI days, was the first to
alert the administration to the troubling dimensions of the Bank of
New York matter, information that Winer believed should have helped
inform foreign and economic policy assessments of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting London himself in March this year, Winer returned
to the United States with a sheaf of documents and serious qualms
about the fact that the FBI had not notified the White House or any
national security specialists about the scale of the problem at the
Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   So Winer rang a few alarms.
</P>
<P>
   In March, he gave copies of his documents to National Security
Council officials and then notified the White House, the CIA and
the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   The news was not well received at the FBI, where investigators
discovered to their dismay that Winer was circulating information
the bureau had passed on in confidence to British investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Other federal agencies found out about the investigation
piecemeal. The Treasury Department, which has played the leading
role in formulating U.S. economic policy toward Russia, did not
learn about the investigation until April 1999, and its knowledge
came from the Federal Reserve in New York. Even the FBI's boss,
Attorney General Janet Reno, had not received a briefing on the
investigation _ and did not until August, after the investigation
was reported in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Then the real fighting began.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau's office complained that the FBI never took the Bank
of New York matter seriously enough until it was highlighted in the
media. While the British were told that an FBI agent in New York,
Steve Chapman, was heading a task force examining the bank's
operations, the British felt Chapman was the only agent involved.
They, according to American investigators familiar with their
viewpoint, dismissed Chapman's effort as ``Task Force Steve.''
</P>
<P>
   People close to the FBI retort that the only reason the
investigation appeared so thinly staffed to the British is because
they were not aware of its entire scope. Moreover, these people
say, Morgenthau is a media hound who never devoted serious
resources to his own investigation of Benex until it burst into the
public spotlight. These people said that if Morgenthau ever had
significant information to share about Benex or the Bank of New
York, the FBI would have welcomed it.
</P>
<P>
   A recent series of meetings was convened at the U.S. Attorney's
Office in Manhattan that, in the eyes of the FBI, was meant to seek
various law enforcement agencies' cooperation in the Bank of New
York investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan District Attorney's Office had a different take on
the meetings. Its investigators said they were told ``to get out of
the way.''

YUGOSLAVIA GIVES NATO $100-BILLION DAMAGE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The NATO bombing campaign last spring caused
$100-billion worth of damages in Yugoslavia, the foreign minister
in Belgrade said on Tuesday. He demanded that NATO pay the costs.
</P>
<P>
   The minister, Zivadin Jovanovic, who is at the U.N. General
Assembly, told reporters: ``Yugoslavia claims the right of full
compensation of war damages resulting from the NATO aggression,
which amount to $100 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   The figure runs considerably higher than the $30-50 billion that
some European officials have estimated that it would cost to repair
the damage in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Jovanovic said he had met ministers from more than 50 countries,
soliciting support for the contention that Yugoslavia was the
victim, not the instigator, of the Kosovo confrontation. Jovanovic
said at a news conference that he had encountered support and
understanding from many United Nations members. He mentioned solely
Russia, which was sympathetic to the Serbian-led government.
</P>
<P>
   NATO began its air strikes on March 24, after the failure of
peace negotiations for Kosovo province. Serbian troops and
paramilitary units had started to force most Kosovo Albanians, who
made up 90 percent of the province, to flee, and stepped up the
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Many were reported killed, and thousands of houses were
destroyed. NATO reported that it dropped 23,000 bombs without
losing a single pilot in the 78-day operation.
</P>
<P>
   Jovanovic said there had been an effort to remove Serbs from
Kosovo after the bombing and after NATO forces and U.N. workers had
moved in. He said that 250,000 Serbs had been expelled and that
more than 400 Serbian civilians had been killed, 600 injured and
500 kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   He also said more than 50,000 houses and apartments occupied by
Serbs had been destroyed, broken into or occupied illegally. About
200,000 people from Albania and Macedonia, Jovanovic added, have
moved into Kosovo illegally and should be expelled.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia is caring for 100,000 refugees and others displaced
from Kosovo, and it is hampered by economic sanctions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His figures are difficult to verify, but they are smaller than
the estimated human cost from the expulsion of the Kosovo
Albanians, which Jovanovic did not mention. Hundreds of thousands
of Albanians were pushed out of Kosovo, aid workers have said,
before being allowed to return under NATO protection.
</P>
<P>
   Jovanovic's statements were dismissed by State Department
spokesman James Rubin. ``The Milosevic regime has no one to blame
but itself for the NATO bombing campaign, which they provoked
through their ethnic cleansing,'' Rubin said, referring to
President Slobodan Milosevic. ``It's time for Yugoslavia to
recognize reality. So long as there's an indicted war criminal at
the helm, their cries will fall on deaf ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Jovanovic also expressed unhappiness with how a Security Council
resolution on Kosovo, approved when the war halted June 10, has
been carried out. It placed the province under ``an international
civil presence'' and set up a framework for an interim
administration that he said was biased against Serbs.

   BOSTON _ Seven people were indicted Tuesday in the largest theft
of public money in state history, as the widening criminal probe
into the state Treasury snared former Treasurer Joseph D. Malone's
campaign fund-raiser and former family lawyer, Richard C. Arrighi.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly said his investigation into
the theft of more than $9.5 million is not over, and he would not
discuss whether Malone had knowledge or shared any responsibility
for the criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not in our practice to rule people in or rule people
out,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Arrighi, 40, of Norwood, a friend of Malone's who won bond
contracts from the Treasury while Malone was in office, was charged
with concealing $1.6 million stolen from the Treasury in a Waltham
real estate trust.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Arrighi, three former Treasury workers, two
businessmen, and another lawyer were indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said most of the money was stolen through schemes
involving false claims made to the state's Unpaid Check Fund, where
checks that have not been cashed were kept with little monitoring
or record-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   The thefts also involved two Treasury workers _ former Deputy
Treasurer Robert Foley and former director of cash management Scot
Butcher _ who hauled $300,000 to $400,000 in ``bags of cash'' out
of the old state employees bank at the Ashburton Place office
buildling, Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, 39, of Norwood, received most of that stolen cash,
according to Reilly's office.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who rode into office in 1990 as a reformer, eventually
closed the bank, though it is not clear whether he knew of the lax
controls there.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, the alleged mastermind behind the thefts, faces a
possible life sentence for his involvement in several schemes and
is under pressure to tell all to investigators, in exchange for
drastically reduced prison time, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The others indicted are: Ronald Borino, 44, a Boston lawyer from
Bedford; Treasury supervisor John ``Trixie'' Trischitta, 47, of
Stoneham; and heir finders Martin Robbins, 51, of Peabody and
Thomas Ciliberto Jr., 51, of Woonsocket, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   All are expected to be arraigned within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictments, the thefts began in 1992 when
Foley and Trischitta, who together oversaw the Unpaid Check Fund,
funneled $1.6 million from the account to a struggling Waltham
condominium project. Reilly said Arrighi and Borino knew about the
money laundering, and helped conceal it.
</P>
<P>
   That transaction touched off years of embezzlement, increasingly
elaborate schemes, and an overzealous attempt at stealing $6.5
million in one transaction from the Unpaid Check Fund, an act that
caught the attention of a BankBoston employee who tipped off the
attorney general's office last February.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, with minimal controls, was fertile ground for fraud,
Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Reilly, Trischitta and Foley allegedly stole $9
million from the account over seven years. They also allegedly
received kickbacks from outsiders known as ``heir finders,'' who
retrieve uncashed checks for those owed the money.
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta and Foley would alert a select group of heir finders
to large uncashed checks, including such things as bond payments,
Reilly said. Heir finders would typically receive a cut of the
check from the rightful owners.
</P>
<P>
   But on Nov. 6, 1998, Trischitta directed his high school buddy
from Malden, heir finder Martin Robbins, to a $6.5 million
unclaimed check with vague ownership. Robbins allegedly put in a
false claim for a fictitious agency, the Cambridge Economic
Development Corp. When Robbins took the check to BankBoston to be
cashed, a teller grew suspicious and notified Reilly's office.
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta kept one-third of the money. Robbins allegedly kept
the rest, at least temporarily. The attorney general's office has
recovered those funds.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $3 million, bilked from the Treasury through other
schemes, has not been recovered and may never be.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the public's money,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said Robbins and Trischitta carried out a kickback scheme
until last February, sharing tens of thousands of dollars in
heir-finder fees, at least 10 percent of the uncashed check.
</P>
<P>
   From 1992 to 1997, the indictments say, Foley and Trischitta
directed $4.2 million in unpaid checks to the Reinke Group, Inc., a
R.I.-based heir-finder company run by Ciliberto, who would get a
cut of the money when he found the rightful owners. Foley and
Trischitta, the insiders, each got 25 percent of Ciliberto's
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's office believes most of the $4.2 million went to
legitimate owners, except for $812,500, which Trischitta allegedly
split with Ciliberto.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Foley, Trischitta, and Arrighi all declined to
comment. Attorneys for Ciliberto and Robbins could not be reached
for comment. Malone also did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Newly elected Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien, who took over the
office in January, has hired KPMG Peat Marwick to audit the agency
in the wake of the scandal. Coincidentally, Butcher now works for
the firm.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said Butcher worked for a KPMG division unrelated to the
audit group that has been working at the Treasury. Butcher also
contributed to O'Brien's campaign. But she said the contributions
will be returned.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne R. Murphy, representing Butcher, said Butcher would be
exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``These indictments against Mr. Butcher are the byproduct of a
politically charged investigation by an elected prosecutor. These
indictments are the result of sweetheart deals with corrupt public
officials who, to gain favor in their own prosecutions, have made
material misrepresentations to implicate an innocent man.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Through the darkest years under Indonesian
rule, one man, known by the nom de guerre Xanana, held almost
magical promise for the East Timorese. Somewhere in the wooded
hills, he led a guerrilla band far outnumbered and outgunned by the
Indonesian army.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, pursued by assorted government ministers and people
who just wanted to get a look, he was at the United Nations to help
plan the future of independent East Timor. He was recognized by his
actual name, Jose Alexandre Gusmao. His newly acquired media aides
call him president. He gets a motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao, 53, has quickly become the leader whom most governments
want to take over East Timor when elections can be held. U.N.
officials and the Indonesian government, which tragically botched
the task of protecting the East Timorese who voted for independence
on Aug. 30, said they can hardly believe their luck.
</P>
<P>
   After years of fighting, they have found in Gusmao a born
conciliator. More than that, a diplomat said on Tuesday, ``He is a
moral beacon.''
</P>
<P>
   East Timor is not only a ruined territory, but also a divided
people. Many Timorese have become Indonesians to some degree,
through education, jobs or marriage. Others joined the
pro-Indonesian militias that ravaged East Timor. Some of Gusmao's
guerrillas have begun looking for revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to go back, because there is a vacuum,'' Gusmao said in
an interview Tuesday, adding that as soon as it is safe, he hopes
to make his Council of East Timorese Resistance an interim
administration.
</P>
<P>
   He does not plan to make it a political party, because its
membership is very broad. Resistance leaders are not very clear
about how much room there will be for party politics in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao is inviting all people who have fled the territory this
year but still think of themselves as Timorese citizens to come
back, he said, including Chinese business families, Indonesians
from other islands and pro-Indonesian East Timorese, even those who
took part in violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they feel that what they did was wrong, they can come and
they can explain to us,'' he said. ``But we will not go to them to
kiss their feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch and a leading
authority on Indonesia, said in an interview that Gusmao ``is
clearly both willing and able to work with a variety of groups.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got qualities that are really those of a statesman, in a
way that no other Timorese leader on the ground even approaches,''
Ms. Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao said he became Xanana in the 1970s when he wanted to be a
journalist after holding a variety of jobs from electrician to
civil service worker and was looking for a pseudonym under which to
write poetry and newspaper articles.
</P>
<P>
   The name went with him into the bush in 1976. He took over the
guerrilla movement by 1979, ``after all my senior leaders were
killed or captured or surrendered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao said the Indonesians seemed to be stunned when they had
to ask for help in controlling East Timor this month. They learned,
he said, that they were not the power they thought they were in
Asia, or in the Islamic world or the nonaligned movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had kept the arrogance they had since independence,'' he
said. ``They thought nobody could impose their will on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao _ who was not included in the Nobel Peace Prize awarded
in 1996 to Jose Ramos-Horta, an exiled spokesman for East Timorese
independence, and Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, the spiritual leader
of East Timor's largely Roman Catholic population _ is not an
unknown quantity to Indonesian officials, civilian or military.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982-83, the Timorese-born Indonesian governor of East Timor,
Mario Viegas Carrascalao, began secret exploratory peace talks with
the guerrilla leader. The negotiations broke down a year later when
16 army engineers were killed and the military reacted with a
savage revenge massacre.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Gusmao, whose wife and two children had fled to
Australia, was captured by Indonesian forces and sent to jail in
Jakarta. Like Nelson Mandela in South Africa, he became a leader
among political prisoners. In July 1997, when President Mandela
went to Indonesia and asked President Suharto to let him meet
Gusmao, the East Timorese leader was suddenly taken from prison to
the presidential guest house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people want to compare me to Mandela,'' he said, ``but
Mandela was my teacher. And meeting with him, in Jakarta, in front
of the nose of Suharto, was a very significant event for me. It was
a recognition of our struggle and of our rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year later, Suharto was forced to resign under
popular pressure. His successor, President B.J. Habibie, reduced
Gusmao's imprisonment to house arrest this February. By then Gusmao
was a factor in Indonesian thinking about what to do in East Timor,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``An important question is: What changed the situation?'' said
John Bresnan, an expert on Indonesia at the East Asian Institute of
Columbia University. ``Clearly part of it was Habibie. But he was
reacting to a letter from John Howard, prime minister of Australia,
who wrote to him in December suggesting a referendum on autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Without consulting his Cabinet,'' Bresnan said, ``Habibie
decided to do that _ and to go a step further and say that if the
Timorese didn't accept autonomy, they would be cut loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, at a news conference, Gusmao was asked whether in
retrospect he wished that the independence referendum had not been
held, considering the violence it provoked. He dismissed the
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought for 23 years for this opportunity,'' he said. ``We
faced all sorts of challenges, dangers. We faced a huge amount of
suffering, a huge death toll, just to gain the right to
self-determination.''

FLEET TO STICK WITH ITS OWN NAME IN MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ BankBoston is about to have its wings clipped.
</P>
<P>
   America's oldest bank will soon bid a reluctant farewell to its
proud name and lofty corporate logo, which depicts a blue-and-white
eagle in flight below a green ``1784,'' the year the patrician
institution was founded.
</P>
<P>
   In a bold and symbolic move, Fleet Financial Group has insisted
that the new company it is forming from its acquisition of
BankBoston bear the Fleet name, according to sources familiar with
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The choice speaks volumes about where the new financial giant is
heading _ and highlights the emotions, pride, and power struggles
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Once billed as a merger of equals, with two companies on equal
footing, Fleet's purchase of its crosstown rival has quickly become
a deal dominated by Fleet's hard-driving chief executive, Terrence
Murray.
</P>
<P>
   In the corridors of the two banks, the prickly issue of names is
more than quibbling over semantics. It is also a barometer of how
two banks with two contrasting cultures _ and two radically
different leaders _ will labor to get along.
</P>
<P>
   According to senior industry sources familiar with the matter,
BankBoston's chief executive, Charles K. Gifford, struggled in
recent weeks to convince Murray to preserve the word ``Boston'' in
the new company's core name. Gifford reportedly argued that
although the new bank has operations far beyond Boston, its local
image was too significant to abandon.
</P>
<P>
   But Murray, a factory worker's son from working-class
Woonsocket, R.I., and a rough-and-tumble deal maker with ambitions
far beyond Boston, was not swayed by Gifford's arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford, the socially prominent scion of a Rhode Island banking
family, will be the number two executive in the new company under
Murray until Murray retires before 2002. Then Gifford is scheduled
to take the reins.
</P>
<P>
   For BankBoston, a 215-year-old institution founded on the shores
of the Charles River to finance merchant trade with China, the name
change is painful. The bank set up offices in Buenos Aires in 1917
to finance the New England wool trade from the Argentine pampas,
and underwrote classic Hollywood films in the 1930s, including
``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Names are a very sensitive issue there because of the
heritage,'' said Gerard Cassidy, an industry analyst at Tucker
Cleary, in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   In a small nod to that heritage, certain parts of BankBoston
will retain their names after they are folded into Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Murray and Gifford have agreed that BankBoston's Latin American
franchise will retain the BankBoston name, since Fleet has no
overseas business and is unknown in the region. And the crown-jewel
investment bank, which comes from BankBoston, will still be called
Robertson Stephens (but will drop the BancBoston before it). The
decisions, industry sources said, had less to do with catering to
BankBoston's pride and more with marketing.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the company uniting all of the new bank's various parts
will be known as Fleet. The retail and commercial banking
operations, which are spread out over New England and the Northeast
and which form the bulk of the company's operations, will bear the
Fleet name.
</P>
<P>
   And the newly hefty bank, which will be the nation's
eighth-largest, with $160 billion in assets, will retain Fleet's
logo of three white sails. Murray, a notorious cost-cutter whose
office is full of nautical-themed art, was reportedly loath to
spend any money tweaking signs and corporate stationery.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's spokesman, James Mahoney, declined to comment on the new
name, saying only that the bank was awaiting a nod from state
regulators for the merger and would announce a name next week. The
Federal Reserve approved the combination last month.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston officials also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford has gone to great lengths to try to portray the
Fleet-BankBoston combination as one of equals. But as the name
struggle suggests, Murray is forcing Gifford to bend on key
matters.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the new bank's executives come from Fleet. And
Gifford has been waging what one source said was a losing battle to
keep BankBoston's mammoth legal team employed. While it is no
surprise to industry observers that Murray retained the Fleet name,
the clash with Gifford over the issd portend major battles
in coming months, as the two men wrangle over what the new bank
should look like.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Gifford has done to his previous competitors what
Murray is doing to him. When the Bank of Boston bought BayBank in
1996, Gifford temporarily called the new company ``BayBank of
Boston,'' and famously exclaimed, ``I love that name!'' Gifford
soon renamed the new company BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   Banks are combining at record pace, arguing that they must pair
up to reduce costs or face acquisition by a rival. In convincing
his competitor to sell his bank last March, Murray played ``the
Boston card,'' and persuaded Gifford of the importance of
maintaining at least one big bank based in Boston. BankBoston,
facing a battered stock price and growing skepticism on Wall
Street, had come to be viewed as a takeover target.
</P>
<P>
   In an early gesture designed to cultivate good will, Murray
temporarily christened the new bank Fleet Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But Murray no longer needs a Boston card.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new Fleet wants to convey itself as a major national
bank,'' said one senior executive familiar with the name change.
``Terry does not feel that the word `Boston' conveys that.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray has bought eight of New England's 10 largest banks over
the past 12 years, and transformed his tiny Providence-born bank
into a regional giant. Some industry observers speculate he's not
done yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Terry's still got one more major play in him,'' said
one Boston executive, speculating Murray, 60, would buy another
bank before retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was Gifford, 57, who ordered up a study from New
York consultants on what the new bank should be called. The study
found that while BankBoston had terrific name recognition inside
Route 128 and to the west, Fleet was tops everywhere else. The
study shortlisted three names: BankBoston, Fleet Boston, and Fleet
Financial Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chad commissioned that study,'' quipped one source. ``And now
it's going to cook his goose.''

FORMER NFL STAR AGREES TO SETTLE ALLEGATIONS WITH SEC

<P>
   Fran Tarkenton, the former National Football League quarterback
who became a computer software entrepreneur, agreed Tuesday to pay
more than $150,000 to settle charges filed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission that he directed a plan to report phony profits
at Knowledgeware Inc., which he ran.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were part of a massive collection of SEC charges
against companies and individuals who were accused of accounting
fraud at 15 public companies. Tarkenton was one of 11 chief
executives named in the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Robert Cankes of Franklin Lakes, N.J., the
former president of Christian Dior Perfumes, the American
subsidiary of the French company owned by LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton SA, settled charges relating to accounting fraud at Model
Imperial, a perfume wholesale concern and Dior customer. Cankes
agreed to pay a $50,000 penalty and to an injunction barring him
from future violations of the securities laws.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were filed exactly one year after Arthur Levitt, the
SEC chairman, warned that the SEC would step up enforcement actions
against what he viewed as abuses of the financial reporting system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collectively, these cases give you a cookbook for cooking the
books,'' said Richard Walker, the SEC's enforcement director. They
included companies that reported nonexistent assets as well as
those that claimed phony sales and reported that expenses were
lower than they really were.
</P>
<P>
   Tarkenton was accused of directing a scheme in 1993 and 1994 to
overstate the revenues and profits of Knowledgeware by recording
sales to distributors while assuring the customers that they would
not have to pay unless they were able to resell the software. The
SEC said the company did that to persuade investors that it was
making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Knowledgeware was acquired by Sterling Software. The
amount of stock paid was adjusted down after Sterling learned that
many of the accounts receivable could not be collected.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Tarkenton, a quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings
and the New York Giants from 1961 through 1978, said Tarkenton was
``pleased to have this matter behind him'' and had neither admitted
nor denied the allegations. He said Tarkenton, who now runs a
company in Atlanta that helps businesses get on the Internet, would
not discuss the charges.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, Tarkenton agreed to an injunction
barring him from violating securities laws in the future, and to
pay a civil penalty of $100,000 and disgorge $54,187, the amount of
a bonus he was paid as a result of the phony profit figures.
Interest will be added to the disgorgement penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt has warned that anyone involved in accounting
irregularities faces possible charges, and in the Knowledgeware
case charges were brought against 11 people, ranging down to
regional sales managers. Nine of the executives settled, while two
sales managers are fighting the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   In the Model Imperial case, the SEC said the company laundered
money that was used to make payments to an individual, now
deceased, who was not identified, for the purpose of obtaining
supplies of perfume. Cankes, the former Dior official, was accused
of lying to auditors when he said he was not aware of those
payments. A lawyer for Cankes said that Cankes would not comment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The SEC charged that officials of Itex Corp., a company in the
barter business, falsified its profits and made $7.7 million in
insider trading profits. The officials are fighting the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Other SEC cases involved two finance companies, each of which
has since filed for bankruptcy, that were said to have falsified
profits when they were highfliers on Wall Street. The companies,
Mercury Finance and First Merchants Acceptance Corp., specialized
in loans to persons with poor credit records.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said that officials of First Merchants, some of whom are
fighting the allegations, had employed techniques like using
company checks to make payments so that customer accounts would not
appear to be delinquent, and classifying some cars as repossessed
even though the company could not find either the car or the
borrower. It charged a former Mercury official, who is fighting the
allegations, with falsifying records to conceal the fact that
revenues were falling.
</P>
<P>
   While most of those charged in the cases were executives or
employees of the companies whose books were said to have been
falsified, in two cases the SEC named the wives of defendants as
well, arguing that they had benefited from money received by their
husbands.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC also made clear that it would go after company officials
who deceived outside auditors about business their companies did
with companies that were suspected of cooking their books.
</P>
<P>
   In a case involving Computone Corp., a software company said to
have falsified its books from 1993 to 1997, charges were filed
against Michael Glaser, the president of CYMA Systems, a customer.
Glaser, who is fighting the charges, was said to have ordered a
subordinate to lie to auditors about whether CYMA had actually
placed a large order with Computone. Glaser's lawyer did not return
a telephone call Tuesday afternoon.

SANTA ANITA TO OPEN TODAY AFTER FACELIFT
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Top thoroughbreds make their return to the
L.A. metropolitan area after two months' absence when the Oak Tree
Racing Association opens its 31st season today at Santa Anita.
They're even-money to recognize the old place.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita has undergone a facelift since its long winter meet
ended in April _ the first visible changes since Frank Stronach's
Magna International purchased the 65-year-old track from Meditrust
for $126 million in December 1998 and installed a new management
team.
</P>
<P>
   __ Twin elevator towers protrude into the once-spacious paddock
gardens, partially obscure views of the track's classic marquee and
force a rerouting of the horses' walk to the track.
</P>
<P>
   __ A 50-by-43-foot video screen dominates the infield, easing
race-watching for grandstand fans, although the structure blocks
views of about 40 yards of the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   __ The area between the grandstand and the rail is transformed
with the construction of terraced standing areas and the addition
of benches and landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   __ The entrance and parking lot off Huntington Drive are
redesigned.
</P>
<P>
   __ The winner's circle is enlarged _ although workmen had yet to
lay the sod 24 hours before today's 1 p.m. opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not be surprised if we're still doing some painting
and landscaping (today),'' said Lonny Powell, the new Santa Anita
president and CEO brought in from smaller Turf Paradise in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The elevator towers will serve a 1,000-seat restaurant and bar
scheduled to open in December as the three-phase renovation
continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's (Stronach) spent, what, $20 million? You can see
it,'' said Bob Baffert, who will seek his third straight Oak Tree
training championship after winning a record 21 races last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see somebody put money into it. The other people
(Meditrust) said they spent $10 million. They (only) painted the
barns!''
</P>
<P>
   Track executives hope the changes _ and the changes to come in
the next two years _ will attract some curious patrons to the
track. But they concede that nicer amenities won't expand business
unless the on-the-track competition improves.
</P>
<P>
   It's generally agreed that improving racing will require drawing
larger fields. The first two Oak Tree programs produced by new
racing secretary Mike Harlow are less than encouraging. Eighty-five
horses were entered in nine races today, down from 87 on opening
day in 1998; 57 were entered in eight races Thursday, down from 79
on day 2 in '98.
</P>
<P>
   Today's card features the fillies-and-mares turf sprint formerly
known as the Autumn Days Handicap but renamed the Sen. Ken Maddy
Handicap, honoring the racing-friendly former state senator from
Fresno. Trainer Richard Mandella looks strong with uncoupled Royal
Shyness (Corey Nakatani riding) and Desert Lady (Gary Stevens).
</P>
<P>
   The 31-day meet's most popular day could be Saturday, when
female turf champion Fiji (Jerry Bailey) is scheduled to make her
1999 debut in the Yellow Ribbon Stakes, the track guarantees a $1
million pick-six pool and the annual collectible-stein giveaway is
planned.
</P>
<P>
   While Baffert defends his Oak Tree training championship, Alex
Solis will go for his third riding title in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Valenzuela is named to ride four horses today, his first
action since being suspended indefinitely at the 1997 Oak Tree meet
following another in his decade-long series of drug-related
absences. Valenzuela, 36, was granted a ``conditional'' license
after agreeing to random drug and alcohol testing and continued
substance-abuse counseling. &QL;

MOST PUPILS CAN'T WRITE WELL, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only about one-quarter of American students can write at a
proficient level, exhibiting ``solid academic performance and
competency over challenging subject matter,'' according to a report
released on Tuesday by the National Assessment of Educational
Progress (NAEP).
</P>
<P>
   Just 1 percent of the nation's students scored in the
``advanced,'' range, while 16 percent of fourth and eighth graders,
and 22 percent of 12th graders, landed below ``basic,'' unable to
even show ``partial mastery of the knowledge and skills'' expected
at their grade level. ``The typical American student is not a
proficient writer,'' lamented Gary W. Phillips, acting commissioner
of the National Center for Education Statistics, as he unveiled the
latest report card. ``These findings are important because how well
students write at the end of the 20th century is an indicator of
how well they will be able to communicate and reason in the
beginning of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorized by Congress and administered by the federal
government's National Center for Education Statistics, NAEP has
been testing students in a range of subjects since 1969, and its
results are known as the nation's report cards. The writing
assessments given to 160,000 fourth, eighth and 12th graders in
1998 are the first of their kind and thus cannot be compared to
previous writing tests, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to test narrative, informative and persuasive writing
skills, the 50-minute tests included one or two writing exercises,
such as a letter to an imaginary friend (for fourth graders), a
pitch to a network executive for an educational television show
(eighth graders), or an essay on whether it is worthwhile to
register to vote. The achievement levels were set by the National
Assessment Governing Board, and judge everything from spelling and
grammar to illustrative detail and coherent argument.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of students _ 61 percent of 4th graders, 57 percent of
eighth graders and 56 percent of high-school seniors _ landed in
the ``basic'' range, scoring between about 115 to 175 out of 300,
depending on the grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``These standards are very high,'' Secretary of Education
Richard W. Riley said at a Washington news conference. ``I think
even some of us who do a lot of writing and speaking would find the
`advanced' level very challening.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some education analysts have long criticized NAEP for
setting its standards too high, Marilyn Whirry, an English teacher
from Manhattan Beach, Calif., who sits on the governing board,
noted that in the latest exams, ``writing at the basic level _ even
at 12th grade _ is not particularly sophisticated and certainly not
powerful.'' With 23 percent of fourth graders, 27 percent of eighth
graders and 22 percent of the seniors scoring at least proficient _
the level the board believes all students should reach _ Ms. Whirry
said she found the results ``both encouraging and sobering.''
</P>
<P>
   The report card showed a significant gender gap, with girls
outscoring boys by 16 to 20 points at all grade levels, and about
twice the percentage of girls as boys scoring in the ``proficient''
level (NAEP has found a smaller, but similar, gap in reading, and
the reverse in math and science). Asian Americans and white
students performed best on the exams: 24 to 36 percent of them were
at the proficient level in various grades, compared to 8 to 11
percent of black, Hispanic and native American test-takers.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut students performed best on the exams, earning an
average score of 165 in the eighth grade, the only level for which
state results were reported. The lowest scores came from the
District of Columbia (126) and the Virgin Islands (124).
</P>
<P>
   Stanley O. Ikenberry, president of the American Council on
Education, a Washington-based association of colleges and
universities, pronounced the results ``very troubling,'' and
suggested that parents should read to their children and urge them
to write letters to their grandparents rather than watching
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``There simply are no jobs available, no roles available, in our
society, for people who cannot communicate effectively _ that
includes both reading and writing,'' Ikenberry said. ``At the
center of everything rests the ability to communicate, the ability
to speak, the ability to write.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In giving the tests, officials also surveyed students on various
habits connected to writing _ all of which they found to improve
performance. About one-third of the students said they use
computers for writing at least once a week, and 80 percent said
they are required to write drafts of their papers. More than
three-quarters of the students said their teachers talk with them
about writing, and save written work in portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   At home, 38 percent of fourth graders and just over half the
other students said they have newspapers, encyclopedia, magazines
and at least 25 books. More than two-thirds of the test-takers
reported discussing their studies at home at least once a week.
</P>
<P>
   Riley used the the unveiling of the newest report card as a
platform to criticize Republican proposals to cut his department's
budget. ``It's one thing to eliminate my job,'' he said, urging
restoration of $60 million for reading programs and $5 million for
writing, ``but it is something else to cut funding to help children
master the basics of reading and writing.''

GATES BUYS STAKE IN TINY SILVER CONCERN
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, the richest man in the world, has
bought 10.3 percent of the Pan American Silver Corp., a tiny silver
mining company based in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly $15 million investment, made by Cascade Investment
LLC, one of Gates' personal investing companies, was made public in
a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gates' investment in Pan American Silver is a fraction
of his net worth, it is nevertheless a significant vote of
confidence in the metals markets. News of Gates' purchase comes at
a time when precious metals prices are jumping. Tuesday, the price
of gold rose 9 percent, the biggest gain in almost two decades. The
December gold contract touched $329 before settling back to $310
Tuesday, capping a two-day rally ignited by the news that 15
European central banks would limit their sales of gold reserves
over the next five years. Silver rose to $5.77 an ounce Tuesday, up
7.6 percent. Rising prices for gold, silver and oil, among other
commodities, are giving rise to renewed concerns about inflationary
pressures in some parts of the financial market.
</P>
<P>
   Gates' investment in silver places him in the company of Warren
E. Buffett, often referred to as the sage from Omaha for his
investing success over the years. Buffett bought 130 million ounces
of silver in early 1998. The hedge fund manager George Soros is
another believer in silver.
</P>
<P>
   Gates hired Michael Larson, a former bond fund manager, in 1994
to manage his personal investments. In addition to the Pan American
stake, Gates owns 10.8 percent of Schnitzer Steel Industries, a
scrap recycling company, and 9.7 percent of Warner Chilcott PLC, a
maker of prescription pharmaceuticals. He has also invested in
several biotechnology companies, including a 14.6 percent stake in
the Corixa Corp. and a 13.2 percent holding in the Icos Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Larson, the son of an industrial engineer, started buying shares
in Pan American Silver in February and added to that position in
August. In the filing, Cascade is said to own 3.15 million shares.
Larson was not available for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalie C. Moore, vice president for corporate relations at Pan
American, reckoned that Cascade paid approximately $5.25 a share
for its stake. The stock closed Tuesday at $6.5625 in Nasdaq
trading. ``Michael Larson was very personable, very laid-back and
unpretentious,'' she said. ``He asked very smart questions and knew
a lot about the silver market before we walked in to talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Pan American was created in 1994 when Ross J. Beaty and John H.
Wright realized that few companies could be considered a pure bet
on silver. That's because 80 percent of the world's silver
production is a byproduct of other mining activities _ such as the
production of lead, zinc, copper or gold. According to Ms. Moore,
there are no more than 25 primary silver mines in the world that
derive at least half of their revenues from sales of silver.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, Pan American has bought all or portions
of mines in Peru, Mexico and Russia. Beaty and Wright were able to
acquire the properties for pennies on the dollar because the mines
were not profitable at prevailing silver prices. They then made the
mines feasible by cutting costs. In their mine in Peru, for
example, Pan American management increased production by 50 percent
while reducing the work force by a third. When the mine was
acquired in 1995, its cash cost to mine silver was about $6 an
ounce. Now it is $3.78 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   Silver may be a compelling investment for Gates because
consumption has been far outpacing supply. In the last year, demand
for silver has grown 5.5 percent. And in the last decade, Ms. Moore
said that 1.6 billion ounces of silver were used that were not
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Because silver accounts for only a tiny portion of the cost of
most medical and technological products, bulls on silver believe
that even if the price goes up, users will not look for replacement
metals. That means demand should remain high.
</P>
<P>
   Pan American Silver is not yet a profitable company. In the
first half of the year, the company had a loss of 12 cents a share,
more than the 7 cents-a-share loss a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But with the price of silver rising and Pan American's costs to
mine the metal declining, the company's future appears promising.
If its mines in Mexico and Russia begin operating next year, the
company's production will rise to 22 million ounces in 2001 from 3
million ounces, according to Ms. Moore. The cash cost of producing
the silver will drop to $2.50 by 2001 from $3.78, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Ms. Moore explained, as the price of silver
rises, more of the increase will translate into sales for Pan
American. ``If silver rises by 10 percent,'' she said, ``our
revenues will go up 8 percent.''

MOTHER BATTLES FOR SON DISABLED AFTER BEING SHAKEN BY BABY SITTER
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, Texas _ Melonie Smith parks her car at the grocery,
hangs a disabled-parking sticker on the rearview mirror and reaches
to pick up her 6-year-old son, Trae.
</P>
<P>
   A group of teen-agers watches. One shouts something that leaves
Smith feeling as if she has been slapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has to have a retarded kid to park close!'' he yells.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at the checkout counter, Smith sees the teen and
confronts him. ``What you said to me,'' she says, ``was really
rude.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Smith's worst fear realized: her son being made an
outsider. It is something she has struggled against since Trae was
left with cerebral palsy, impaired vision and learning disabilities
after being severely shaken by a baby sitter when he was 11 weeks
old.
</P>
<P>
   After doctors told Smith that Trae would die or would live in a
vegetative state, her goal was simply that her son survive. Now her
mission is that he grow up to live independently.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Smith, 36, wages constant battles with insurance
companies, with doctors and teachers, with rude teen-agers, and
with her conscience and faith in God.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the hardest issues concerning my son as a survivor is
the fact that most agencies only see him as a financial burden, one
that is ongoing and a waste of time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Anger and worry are her constant companions. But Smith makes
sure that Trae doesn't witness her inner struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to always cry in front of Trae and be angry,
that's all he's going to know, because you're all he's got,'' she
said. ``If I cry in front of him, I tell him it's because I'm real
proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   At 5:30 a.m., Smith begins her grueling weekday schedule. She
showers and then fixes Trae's breakfast. Then it's off to
kindergarten at a special program at Meadow Creek Elementary School
in Bedford, Texas, outside Fort Worth. Next stop is her full-time
job supervising computer systems at Petrosurance Casualty Co. in
Arlington, another Fort Worth suburb. Lunch breaks are a distant
memory. She skips them so she can leave work early to pick up Trae
at a child-care center and take him to late-afternoon physical
therapy sessions.
</P>
<P>
   She also must find time to take Trae to his medical
appointments. He has 13 doctors, including a neurologist, an
orthopedic specialist and a gastroenterologist. Not to be forgotten
are other therapy classes, including swimming lessons at 7:15 a.m.
Tuesdays and Thursdays and equestrian therapy on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't trust many people, so she takes Trae almost
everywhere she goes, including grocery stores, restaurants, Rangers
baseball games and seminars about shaken babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``She exposes him to everything, probably more than normal
children will get,'' said Smith's mother, Brenda Fetsch, 55, of
Waco, Texas. ``She tirelessly hunts for every kind of therapy and
every kind of doctor, not to heal him but to bring him to his
greatest potential that he can possibly be.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who has been divorced three years, has no social life.
She has little time for a relationship or for meeting friends for a
glass of wine after work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work, and I have Trae,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her former husband is still part of Trae's life, but he lives in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Life might be easier for Smith if she moved to Waco in Central
Texas, where she has a large, loving family. But she insists on
staying put, she says, because the Metroplex offers the best
services for Trae.
</P>
<P>
   In the evenings at their apartment, she makes dinner, plays with
Trae, bathes him and goes to bed with him about 9 p.m. Trae can't
sleep unless his hand or foot is touching his mom.
</P>
<P>
   Smith uses the time before she falls asleep to write letters to
insurance companies and tend to unfinished business. ``I do my
battles between 9 and midnight in bed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smith is often consumed with anger that the lanky Trae, who
weighs 38 pounds, has to struggle to walk and to talk and is often
the subject of stares and jeers.
</P>
<P>
   In his first 11 weeks, Trae was a typical healthy baby. Then, in
March 1993, he was shaken so hard that he had to be rushed by
helicopter ambulance to Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors told Smith and her husband, Bud, that their baby was in
pain and was dying. The shaking had left Trae with bleeding in his
brain and retinal hemorrhaging, and he was suffering grand mal
seizures. He was breathing with the aid of a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and her husband decided to take Trae off the ventilator. A
family priest from Waco gave Trae the last rites, and paperwork for
organ donations was signed. The ventilator was disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   But then Trae gasped for air. His mother and others took it as a
sign that he wanted to live.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   Smith seethes when she recalls that for three months in 1993,
Trae was taken from her because Child Protective Services believed
that she or her husband was responsible for his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one thing to know that your 11-week-old baby could die
from shaken baby syndrome, but it is another to have authorities
thinking that you are capable of such a deplorable crime upon your
very own child,'' said Smith, who later co-founded the Shaken Baby
Alliance based in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the baby sitter acknowledged during a Child
Protective Services hearing that she had shaken Trae. When the
sitter was not prosecuted, Smith worked to put a case together,
gathering documents and affidavits from physicians. But by the time
she had finished, the three-year statute of limitations for an
injury to a child case had expired, she said.
</P>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives have counseled Smith to let go of her
anger, but she says she wants to hold on to it because it fuels her
fight for her son.
</P>
<P>
   She knows that when one battle with insurance companies is won,
another looms. Smith looks for after-hours therapy sessions so she
can take Trae after work, but insurance companies won't pay for
them. They turn down coverage for home therapy because ``it is a
convenience for mom,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A social worker has suggested that Trae would receive better
services if Smith went on welfare and put him on Medicaid, but
Smith has rebuffed that idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be ahead if I didn't work,'' she said. ``But I was
raised to get off my butt. People don't understand why I don't
quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a good education. It's not for everyone else to take
care of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Trae has had two eye surgeries and stomach surgery, had fluid
removed from around his brain and had several electrocardiograms
because of seizures.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Dr. Warren Marks prepared to give Trae injections of
Botox, a form of the botulism toxin, to loosen up his arms and legs
that have been tightened by cerebral palsy. To try to calm her son,
Smith held up a ticket receipt for a Barney show they will attend
in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barney will be here,'' she assured him. ``You can tell Barney
you are a brave, brave soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   Trae whimpered and cried. Then he screamed. Smith burst into
tears, but she turned her head so Trae couldn't see her.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she used to be overly defensive when people stared at
her son. She occasionally walked up to them and asked, ``Do you
have a problem?'' Now, she said, she may say something like: ``I
noticed you watching my son. I'd be happy to answer any questions
that you have about him.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she has found that not everyone is being rude when they
stare. Some are simply concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Insensitive remarks still get to her, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how you feel,'' a person close to her said one day.
``My dog almost died after it was run over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to have another child so that you will know what it
is like to be a real mother,'' another person said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, conscious of the stares, always makes sure that Trae's
hair is styled and that his clothes are pressed, Fetsch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to look at him in public, so if they're
looking at him, he's going to be spotless and well-groomed,''
Fetsch said.
</P>
<P>
   At day care, Trae has been hit, bitten, pushed and called names,
Smith said. Last year, she wrote a letter to other parents,
describing his history and physical condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this helps each of you to understand Trae better,'' she
wrote. ``Trae has already suffered enough physical abuse. Please
help me make his life easier by taking time and talking to your
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The children were nicer to Trae after the letter was sent, Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smith says she is still struggling to reclaim the faith she lost
after Trae was injured. She says she sometimes feels guilty and
asks herself why she should have such a burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel like Jesus carrying a cross, except my cross
is not a wooden cross but my son,'' she said. ``I carry him through
the crowd and they stare, push us, curse us and pass us by. But I
can't lay this cross down because of the love I have in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday, Smith and Trae attended services at St.
Michael Catholic Church in Bedford. Trae began to whimper during
the sermon and waved his hand in a signal that his mother
recognizes as, ``I want to go home.'' He ripped a page in the
hymnal as the congregation sang ``The Lord Is Kind and Merciful.''
He touched his mother's face and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the sermon, Smith picked up Trae and headed for
the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was distracted around me,'' she whispered as she and
Trae peered into the sanctuary through a window.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Timothy Vaverek of St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Waco
has been a lifeline for Smith, she says. She jokes that by the time
she is finished with her confession, the line outside the booth is
long.
</P>
<P>
   Vaverek, who administered the last rites to Trae more than six
years ago, said Smith's challenge is to continue to focus on
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an evil thing that happened to this child,'' he said.
``You can't put the genie back in the bottle. You can't go back to
that moment and not drop the child off. You have to deal with your
own guilt, your own sense of what ifs, which could destroy you.''

COMMENTARY: COBBLING A NEW IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ Maybe women love shoes because they hear the
Cinderella story so often when they're little. With the perfect
shoe comes the perfect guy.
</P>
<P>
   But does that equation apply to presidential politics?
</P>
<P>
   I went to check out the New Gore at a fund-raiser in a Maryland
suburb. He now takes the microphone and strolls a bit, like
Elizabeth Dole. He tries to empathize, telling the well-heeled
African-American guests that when he came back from Army basic
training with shorn hair and a uniform in 1969, he got angry stares
from the flower-power crowd: ``I'm telling you, it was a Ralph
Ellison moment.''
</P>
<P>
   He cuts loose by confiding that he only pretends to have read
Stephen Hawking. He's leaner and more twangy. He wears lighter
suits and colored shirts and cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   W. has traded his cowboy boots for black loafers to look more
earnest, and Al has traded his black loafers for cowboy boots to
look less earnest.
</P>
<P>
   It's unsettling when candidates begin fiddling with their
clothes and hair and speech patterns, trying to project a different
image. They are in public life for decades and they still don't
know who they are?
</P>
<P>
   Candidates pay political consultants millions for fashion advice
so they can ``be themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   During the final weeks of Michael Dukakis' moribund '88
campaign, he began wearing an aide's brown suede jacket on the
mistaken assumption that it made him seem warmer and cozier.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, George Bush, senior, was busy shedding
his striped watchbands and half-glasses, trying not to look so
preppy. But no matter how much the late Lee Atwater babbled about
the candidate's taste for pork rinds, Bush reeked of Greenwich and
Kennebunkport, of gin martinis and J. Press blue blazers and
Topsiders. He was a Ralph Lauren moment.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Morris wrote that he fussed over President Clinton's ties
before meetings, worried that staid ties would smack of staid
thinking. He also advised him in '96 to dress more patriarchally:
``You don't look presidential in light-colored suits.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Panetta discouraged the jogging shorts that showed off the
president's bread-pudding thighs.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Alexander's plaid shirt failed to catch populist fire
because it was too gimmicky. The sartorial message must be
subliminal.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kennedy went to great lengths to camouflage his youth and
inexperience by dressing formally for every public occasion. He
would never do what Bill Clinton did, wear a polo shirt to a war
council. Polo was for sailing.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole tries to coordinate the color of suit and shoes
to the stage where she speaks, but the attention is so minute it
backfires and makes her seem a martinet.
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Bradley wants to evoke his past as a sports legend, he
simply pulls on those old orange and blue Knicks socks for a beach
walk.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Beschloss, the historian who compiled the LBJ tapes,
says that Lyndon Johnson used clothes in a power play with Hubert
Humphrey. Although the two men both had great stature in the
Senate, President Johnson wanted to show after the '64 election
that his vice president was a wholly-owned subsidiary. So he
dressed Hubert in a beige ranch suit and Stetson identical to his
own, and then summoned photographers to his ranch. When the tall
president and shorter, pudgy vice president posed on horseback in
their matching outfits, poor Humphrey looked like an LBJ Mini-Me.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny how often you can sum up a politician's flaws or the
mood of a certain era by evoking a costume.
</P>
<P>
   FDR's cape. The hole in Adlai Stevenson's shoe. Richard Nixon
walking on the beach in wingtips. Jimmy Carter wearing a gray
cardigan during the energy crisis and collapsing while jogging in
black socks. Ronald Reagan's brown suit, which he wore boldly in a
city of navy and gray. Dukakis swerving in the tank in that Snoopy
helmet. Clinton answering the question on boxers or briefs.
Monica's DKNY beret and Gap dress, and the Zegna tie she gave
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the outside can only crystallize impressions of the inside.
Loafers won't make W. seem diligent. Boots won't make Al seem
down-home. These Princes Sometimes Charming will need more than new
slippers to get elected.

BEDFORD, Texas: destroy you.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Family members and those who work with Trae say they are amazed
at how far he has come. They say they credit Smith's devotion and
perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I wouldn't cave in,'' said Smith's sister, Julie
McIntyre, 31, who has two children and lives in Arlington. ``If I
had to do it myself, I would have moved back to Waco.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith says that during the past few years, she has had to stop
being so protective of Trae and to relinquish some control to his
teachers and therapists.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Melonie first came to me and brought him to the
classroom, basically what she told me was that I was not to tell
Trae no and that he never did anything wrong,'' said Lori Box, who
taught Trae's preschool class for the disabled at Bell Manor
Elementary School in Bedford. ``He needed to learn that there were
ground rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Box persuaded Smith to put Trae in child care during the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has helped him to be around peers and have social
interaction,'' Box said. ``He has gained a lot of independence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith has not been shy about questioning teachers and
demanding what she believes is best for Trae, even if it means
hours of research or showing up unannounced at his classes.
</P>
<P>
   In three years, Trae has progressed from having trouble
communicating to being able to say three- and four-word sentences.
He also can follow directions with help and now walks up to people
and says ``Hi,'' said Nancy Shadowens, a speech teacher at Bell
Manor Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   Valuable help also has come from family members, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The weakened facial muscles that make it difficult for Trae to
speak also cause him to drool. Smith's brother, Adam Fetsch, 18,
taught Trae to wipe his face on his shirt. Last year, Fetsch led a
project with his football teammates at La Vega High School in
Bellmead to increase awareness about the dangers of shaking babies.
</P>
<P>
   The school was rewarded with $10,000 as Texas' grand-prize
winner of the Lowe's Home Team Award.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's goal that Trae live independently is not out of the
question, said Shadowens, the speech teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think miracles happen,'' she said. ``If he keeps going on
the track he is and his family supports him and gets the help, I
think it's very realistic.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As the toll continued to mount in Chechnya after six
days of Russian bombing, several leading Russian opposition
politicians broke ranks on Tuesday and called for an end to the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen reports say that 384 people have been killed and more
than 1,000 injured in the punitive raids and that tens of thousands
of Chechens have fled their mountainous province in panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the time being, that is enough,'' said Aleksei Arbatov, a
ranking member of the liberal Yabloko Party, which has until now
supported the Russian air war against Chechen-led attacks in
neighboring Dagestan. ``I think we should make a pause in the
bombing, or else it might become counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military says it is attacking economic and military
targets controlled by Islamic militants who have set up training
bases in Chechnya, a region that has drifted out of Russian control
since secessionists defeated federal forces in a bloody war that
ended in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Chechen warlords, Islamic militants attacked villages in
Dagestan in August. The Chechens also have been accused by Russian
authorities of being the masterminds behind a terrorist campaign in
Russia that has killed almost 300 people in a series of
apartment-house bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Although an alarmed and outraged public has given broad support
to the Russian military response, some politicians contend that
even a war against terrorism cannot justify civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorism is a great crime that demands certain measures,''
said Sergei Kovolev, a longtime human rights campaigner and a
member of Parliament. ``It may require killing terrorists. But
there is no justification for generals' saying that because there
are terrorist bases among civilians, civilians have to be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also lingering doubts about whether the government has
hard evidence that would link the terrorist attacks here to Chechen
militants.
</P>
<P>
   ``One always wants to respond to force with force,'' Konstantin
Titov, the liberal governor of the Samara region, was quoted by
Reuters. ``But is it proven or not that the terrorist acts were the
work of Chechen terrorists? So far, it has not been shown.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporting on Tuesday to President Boris Yeltsin, Internal
Affairs Minister Vladimir Rushaylo said that a nationwide
anti-terror operation had led to 101 arrests. He gave no details.
Rushaylo said the police had seized 520 tons of explosives,
preventing 16 potential explosions.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time Tuesday, an international aid organization
responded to an appeal from regional authorities to help shelter
and feed an estimated 65,000 Chechen refugees who have been
streaming across the border into Ingushetia, another neighboring
Russian province. Responding to an official request from the
Ingushetia government, the Moscow office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees agreed to send an aid shipment.
</P>
<P>
   Top Russian officials issued assurances that the federal
government could deal with the refugee crisis on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is under control,'' the minister in charge of
emergencies, Sergei Shoigu, said Tuesday on a one-day visit to the
region. ``It hasn't gone as far as to warrant talking about a
humanitarian catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from the Chechen capital, Grozny, a top
Chechen official said that the Chechen leader, Aslan Maskhadov, was
ready to reopen a dialogue with Moscow, but that his appeals to
Moscow and to foreign intermediaries had been met with silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the first day of the bombing, carried out under the
pretext of attacking terrorists, villages and settlements have been
hit by air strikes,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Kazbek Makhashev.
``Dozens of villages were practically wiped off the face of the
earth. While they are cynically talking about high-precision bombs,
they have been hitting civilian objects. In one district, the bombs
hit a school, and eight people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   `'We have more than once showed readiness for political
dialogue. But now we have nothing else to do but prepare for our
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen government has denied responsibility for the Islamic
militants but has resisted Moscow's pressure to condemn their
activities. Instead, Chechen officials have attributed the violence
in the northern Caucasus to Russian politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is using Chechnya as a testing range for its own
domestic political struggles,'' Makhashev said. ``It is more
profitable for Russia to destroy Chechnya than to restore its
economy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview published this week, Russian Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin, who entered office days after the first strike into
Dagestan in August, said that Russia had no choice but to attack
Chechen territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we are victims of an aggression by international
terrorism,'' Putin said. ``The whole world knows that terrorists
must be destroyed at their bases.''

   In six days of bombing, Russian planes have struck a broad swath
of targets, including oil refineries, telecommunications centers, a
television station and the Grozny airport. But Chechens who have
been able to call Moscow say the strikes had strayed off target,
killing innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   Devastated by the 1994-96 war, Chechnya has been further ruined
by lawlessness and a wave of kidnappings that have put the region
virtually out of bounds for foreign reporters and international aid
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bombing began last week, Russian television stations
have shown film of burning factories and damage at the Grozny
airport, but no pictures of the civilian casualties reported by
Chechen authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Kovolev, who recently returned from a trip to Dagestan, said at
a news conference Tuesday that a ``rigid information war'' was
being waged on the Russia news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a clear vacuum in our information,'' he said. ``The
situation demands human rights monitoring. But no opportunity for
that is being provided.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts fear that the Russian military, which has
reportedly massed 50,000 troops along the Chechen border, may begin
a ground operation into Chechnya, pitching Russia back into another
all-out war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to now, what has been done is logical, but it is enough,''
said Arbatov, whose party has spoken out against a ground invasion.
``But if we continue this punishment on and on, then the deterrent
effect will go down, and instead it may provoke new acts of
terrorism.''

   FRANCE: HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS PROTEST
</P>
<P>
   High school students took to the streets again, threatening to
renew a widespread protest movement begun a year ago. Insisting
that the government had done nothing about its promises to provide
more teachers and classrooms, student leaders called for nationwide
protests on Thursday. Last year almost half a million students
disrupted classes for several weeks to protest crowded schools and
a shortage of teachers.

   GERMANY: SLAVE LABOR PROGRESS
</P>
<P>
   American and German officials working on a plan to compensate
victims of slave labor under the Nazis have made progress on ways
to insure that German companies that pay into a compensation fund
would not be sued again, government officials said. But Otto
Lambsdorff, chief negotiator in talks with the United States and
victims' groups, said they had not discussed an overall figure for
the compensation fund. New talks are to start on Oct. 6 in
Washington.

   GERMANY: REICHSTAG BACK PAY
</P>
<P>
   In a letter of appeal to the president of parliament, Wolfgang
Thierse, the British architect Lord Norman Foster demanded he be
paid the $2.2 million still owed for his prize-winning work on the
renovated Reichstag building. The Berlin Federal Building Society
said it was withholding 10 percent of Lord Foster's $22 million fee
until 45 planning and construction errors are fixed.

   BRITAIN: PINOCHET PLEA
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Gen. Augusto Pinochet told a London court that he
should not be extradited to Spain to stand trial on torture charges
because there was no evidence of his responsibility for the acts
and no reason for Spain to be involved in the case. Pinochet, 83,
who was the dictator of Chile from 1973 to 1990, was arrested in
London last October on an extradition request from a Spanish judge.
A verdict is expected next month.

   ITALY: ANDREOTTI REVISITED
</P>
<P>
   After a brief pause to await the verdict on his trial in Perugia
last week, the trial of former Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti on
charges of collusion with the Mafia resumed in Sicily. Andreotti,
80, was acquitted of charges he conspired in the 1977 murder of a
journalist. In Sicily he is accused of having been the Mafia's
chief protector while in power. The trial, which began in 1995, is
expected to end next month.

   CANADA: `ICE MAN' DATED
</P>
<P>
   Canada's ``ice man,'' an Indian hunter found frozen in a British
Columbia glacier last month, has been dated to around 1450 A.D.,
about 300 years before contact with Europeans. Radiocarbon datings
of samples of the man's hat and cloak indicated that the materials
were collected at the same time, between 1415 and 1445.

   CANADA: CELL PHONE ALERT
</P>
<P>
   Canada's largest gas station chains have started asking
customers to turn off their cell phones while at the pumps for fear
of setting off explosions. The ban started after Ontario's
Technical Standards and Safety Authority warned that tiny sparks
from inside cellphones could ignite gas vapors. But other safety
experts say there is no more chance of a cell phone setting off an
explosion than there is of static electricity causing a blaze.

illegal weapons. The authority is required to confiscate unlicensed
weapons as part of its latest pact with the Israelis. The
resistance is a sign of the problems facing Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, as he tries to fulfill his obligations under
the accord.

GOP CHAIRMAN APPEALS TO BUCHANAN TO STAY IN PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the Republican National Committee
met with Pat Buchanan on Tuesday and made his own appeal not to
bolt the party and fracture Republican ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man revealed how long they conferred. But Jim Nicholson,
the party chairman, made clear that he had tried to use both
personal loyalties and matters of principle to appeal to Buchanan,
the conservative commentator.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson said in a statement that he had asked Buchanan to
``consider very carefully'' before taking any actions that would
help Democrats retain their hold on the presidency
</P>
<P>
   He also reminded Buchanan, who has long been staunchly opposed
to abortion, that the next president would ``almost certainly make
several lifetime appointments to the Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   And he asked Buchanan, once a high-ranking aide to former
President Reagan, ``to consider what Reagan would advise him to do
_ what Reagan himself would do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Townsend, Buchanan's campaign director, would only confirm
there was a meeting, but refused to say anything further.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans now consider it inevitable that Buchanan will
bolt and seek the Reform Party nomination. Some Republicans close
to Nicholson said that he is now more concerned with holding onto
Buchanan's conservative followers than with keeping Buchanan
himself and did not want Buchanan's followers to feel that the
establishment had forced him from the party.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's third party flirtation has caused strife in
Republican ranks, particularly after the commentator became a
political lightening rod with a new book questioning whether Hitler
had hostile intentions towards the United States or whether the
Nazis were drawn into war with the West by Britain and France's war
guarantees to Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, one of the party's presidential contenders,
challenged Republicans to let Buchanan go, calling his views of
World War II unacceptable. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who is
considered the Republican front-runner, however, said he wanted
Buchanan to remain in the party.

 &HT;    LSU's DiNardo keeps poise
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ When Gerry DiNardo arrived at LSU in 1995, his
motto for the Tigers was ``bring back the magic.'' Five years
later, there are growing numbers in Baton Rouge saying ``get rid of
the curse.''
</P>
<P>
   The honeymoon is officially over for the former Notre Dame star
and Vanderbilt coach. After going 26-9-1 in DiNardo's first three
seasons, the Tigers fell to 4-7 last year. DiNardo's supporters
wrote off that season as a fluke. But when LSU was steamrollered
41-7 at home by Auburn on Oct. 18, the wolves came out.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a columnist for the Purple and Gold, a weekly
newspaper devoted to the coverage of LSU sports, called for the
firing of DiNardo and athletics director Joe Dean. The student
newspaper, the Daily Reveille, called the team an
``embarrassment.'' DiNardo was asked on his weekly call-in radio
show if he ``needs any help moving out of town.'' Baton Rouge
Advocate columnist Scott Rabalais ripped the entire program, from
the administrators all the way down to the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the 46-year-old DiNardo has tried to remain
upbeat and positive. And despite the barrage of criticism, he has
not lashed out at the media or the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you've got to continue to show the team what they're
doing well,'' DiNardo said Tuesday. ``Everyone else is telling them
what they're doing wrong _ constantly and continuously _ and so you
kind of have to do the opposite. `Hey look, you know, we're OK
here, we're doing this pretty good. We can get better.' ''
</P>
<P>
   DiNardo recognizes the reality of his situation. He knows his
team has better turn it around soon. Coaching changes are common in
the SEC, and at LSU as much as anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only guy to last in this position for more than four
years since Charlie McClendon,'' DiNardo said. ``I think we all
know what's going on. We all know this is a tough business.''
</P>
<P>
   DiNardo got a vote of confidence from the athletics director
after the Auburn game. Dean essentially reiterated what he told The
Advocate back in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gerry DiNardo doesn't have a problem here,'' Dean said. ``He
is recruiting well. He cares academically as much as anyone that's
ever been here, which is really critical to our board and to our
chancellor and to me. I think they'll have a pretty good year, but
even if they don't he'll be the coach here in the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Tigers (2-1, 0-1 SEC) are facing their toughest
stretch of the season. After Saturday's game against No. 10
Georgia, LSU plays No. 3 Florida at home, then Kentucky and
Mississippi State on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs (3-0, 1-0 SEC) knocked off then No. 6 and
undefeated LSU 28-27 last year in Baton Rouge and sent the Tigers
on their present downward spiral. Conversely, a win against Georgia
could help right LSU's reeling ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they're going to come up here trying to set the
course for the rest of their year,'' Georgia coach Jim Donnan said.
``Revenge, in sports, doesn't help you much. But I'm sure they're
going to be ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   LSU's problem with Auburn was evident. The Tigers committed six
turnovers, including five in the first half. They trailed 34-0
before scoring in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers will be coming into Sanford Stadium, where they're
6-4 all time, with a new quarterback. DiNardo named sophomore Josh
Booty the starter after the Auburn game. Booty set a school record
with 58 passes in that game, completing 29 and throwing for a
touchdown and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   LSU was off last Saturday, so it has had two weeks to prepare
for the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winner of the LSU-Georgia game is going to be whoever
plays the game the best,'' DiNardo said. ``I mean, we can talk
about all the other subplots and everything else but, come game
time, it's whoever plays the game the best.''

BUSH IS IN TERRIFIC HEALTH, DOCTOR'S REPORT PROCLAIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Other than some stiffness in one knee, some
tightness in his back and a minor loss of high-frequency hearing,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the front runner for the Republican
presidential nomination, is in terrific health, according to a
three-page medical summary that was prepared by his physician and
released on Tuesday by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper of Dallas, who has been Bush's physician
for nearly 10 years, said a thorough examination of Bush on June 17
gave him a clean bill of health on all the important fronts.
</P>
<P>
   The tests performed on Bush, 53, showed him to have good
cholesterol levels and blood pressure, strong lungs and no
indications of prostate cancer. He was free of arthritis, the
report said. There was no visible hardening of his arteries.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing such medical information, Bush and his aides were
in one sense simply performing what has become a requisite station
of the cross for presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But aspects of Cooper's report suggested that the Bush campaign
was also trying to address _ and discourage _ some of the questions
that reporters have asked about reckless behavior in Bush's past.
Bush has refused to say whether he ever used illegal drugs as a
younger man. He has said he used to drink alcoholic beverages, but
not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   In the medical report on Bush, Cooper writes, ``He has totally
abstained from alcohol during the past 13 years. He has no history
of any alcohol, drug, mental or psychiatric treatment or
rehabilitation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also made Cooper available, upon request, for
interviews with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is extremely early in a presidential race for a
contender to release medical information, the Bush campaign had
fielded several requests for it from reporters, an illustration of
the degree to which Bush is being treated as the presumptive
Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The medical report reveals that Bush had two benign polyps
removed from his colon on July 6, 1998; takes no prescribed
medications; exhibits no signs of anemia or diabetes; is
far-sighted; and sticks to low-fat foods.
</P>
<P>
   That dietary discipline, coupled with 15 to 20 miles of running
every week, keeps his weight down to about 192 pounds, only five
pounds above the preferred measurement for a man who is six-feet
tall, as Bush is, according to Cooper's report.

U.S. LIKELY TO REGAIN A U.N. FINANCE SEAT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States is likely to regain a seat on
the important U.N. budget committee, clearing one hurdle the
Clinton administration faced in getting Congress to pay back dues
to the organization, a senior American official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has been lobbying foreign
ministers for more than a week here. She was told Tuesday by the
regional group including European countries, Canada and Australia
that it would present a slate of candidates for the committee and
not demand that the United States fight for a seat alone against
considerable opposition from many delegations.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats have been arguing that Washington lost the right
to sit on the committee by falling so far behind in what it owes
the United Nations _ $1.7 billion by the organization's
calculations. They said the Americans should not return to the
committee until they are paid up.
</P>
<P>
   Albright made an end-run around foreign missions here, and
talked directly to high-level officials who have been in New York
for the opening debate of the General Assembly. A European diplomat
said her argument made sense. She told ministers that without a
seat on the budget committee, the administration would have an
impossible task persuading Congress to allocate any money. Members
of Congress had demanded that the United States be reinstated
first, a demand that infuriated diplomats here.
</P>
<P>
   But governments concerned about the future of the United Nations
decided that it was better to help the administration in getting
Congress to start paying U.S. bills than to stand on principle _
even though there is still no guarantee that Congress will provide
any significant amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, other stipulations about the work of the United
Nations are still attached to legislation. It is also likely that
the United States will not in any case pay enough to avoid losing
its vote in the General Assembly, because Congress calculates the
American debt much lower.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. assessments are treaty obligations and cannot be altered by
any member government.
</P>
<P>
   Albright was able to put her close relations with a growing
group of female foreign ministers to good use in her campaign. Some
Nordic countries were holding out against a seat for the United
States, claiming it for themselves instead. France and New Zealand
also wanted places on the committee. But there were only two
vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   Two influential Nordic foreign ministers _ Anna Lindh of Sweden
and Tarja Halonen of Finland, who is also chairman of the European
Union until the end of the year _ were at a dinner Albright held
for female foreign ministers last week. Halonen's support turned
out to be crucial, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Albright was told by the chairman of the European
and others in the regional group that its members had reached
consensus on the two seats, which, unless there is an unforeseen
revolt, will go next week to France and the United States without a
vote.

FORWARDS 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No team has a more dynamic duo than wingers Teemu Selanne and
Paul Kariya. They combined for 86 goals and 208 points last season,
so the first line should be no problem. This year, Anaheim is
hoping vastly underrated Steve Rucchin (23 goals, 62 points),
newcomer Ted Donato and Marty McInnis will form its best second
line yet. &QL; 
The young checking line of Antti Aalto, Mike LeClerc and Jeff
Nielsen figures to play a crucial role in the team's forechecking
system. Enforcers Jim McKenzie and Stu Grimson are around to
provide protection for Kariya and Selanne. &QL; 
DEFENSE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks improved their skill level by trading for Oleg
Tverdovsky and drafting European veteran Niclas Havelid to go along
with power-play specialist Fredrik Olausson (16 goals, 56 points). &QL; 
Anaheim, however, must get another solid season from the
defensive-minded pairing of Jason Marshall and Kevin Haller and
continued improvement from Ruslan Salei and Pavel Trnka. This is
still their most vulnerable position. &QL; 
GOALTENDING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Guy Hebert seems to be getting better with age, but coach Craig
Hartsburg hopes to keep the only remaining original Duck fresher by
cutting his work load. Last year, Hebert played in 69 games. Look
for Dominic Roussel to get more starts. &QL; 
SPECIAL TEAMS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If everybody stays healthy there's no reason the NHL's
top-ranked power play in 1998-99 shouldn't be just as powerful,
especially with the addition of Tverdovsky to play on the second
unit. &QL; 
The penalty-killing unit had its ups and downs last year and
finished 15th in the league. That group will need to step up for
the Ducks to take the next step. &QL; 
COACHING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The intense Hartsburg was just the right fit last season, even
though he didn't get the national recognition he deserved. &QL; 
OUTLOOK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A fourth-place finish in the Western Conference isn't out of the
question, but while Anaheim looks to be a team on the rise, it has
a thin margin for error. &QL;

SUPREME COURT TO RULE ON LAW THAT ALLOWS RAPE VICTIMS TO SUE
ATTACKERS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Va., Colo., Wash.)  
 (Eds: SUBS 3rd graf, In a ruling ..., to give full name of school,
Virginia Polytechnic Institute AND STATE UNIVERSITY.)  (nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Taking up a case with broad implications for its
continuing reappraisal of federal power, the Supreme Court agreed
Tuesday to decide whether Congress had the authority to open the
federal courts to civil lawsuits by victims of rape, domestic
violence and other crimes ``motivated by gender.''
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the fate of a 1994 law, the Violence Against Women
Act, which Congress passed after concluding, on the basis of four
years of hearings, that state court systems were not dealing
adequately with an epidemic of violence against women. The law
created a new federal civil remedy, permitting victims to sue their
attackers for damages, including punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling last March, the federal appeals court in Richmond,
Va., declared the law unconstitutional and dismissed a suit brought
by a student at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
against two fellow students, football players who she contended had
raped her in her dormitory room shortly after the start of her
freshman year in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed by Christy Brzonkala, was the first to be
brought under the law's civil damages provision, and has been
watched closely during its journey through the courts. The two men
fought the suit by arguing that the civil damages section of the
law exceeded Congress' authority to assert federal jurisdiction
over matters of traditional state concern. One defendant was
eventually punished by Virginia Polytechnic with a deferred
suspension that enabled him to complete his college football
career; the university's judicial committee took no action against
the other.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals striking
down the law was cast in very broad terms, with Judge J. Michael
Luttig, writing for the 7-4 majority, declaring that the Violence
Against Women Act ``simply cannot be reconciled with the principles
of limited federal government upon which this nation is founded.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling held that because violence against women had only
``an attenuated and indirect relationship with interstate
commerce,'' the law was not a proper exercise of congressional
authority under the Constitution's commerce clause. Nor was the law
a valid exercise of Congress' authority to enforce the equal
protection guarantee of the 14th Amendment, the 4th Circuit held,
because the law sought to regulate purely private conduct rather
than the state action at which the 14th Amendment is directed.
</P>
<P>
   Both these broad propositions place the case in the center of
the court's continuing debate over defining the boundary between
federal and state authority. In a series of decisions over the last
four years, culminating in June with three handed down on the final
day of the court's term, the court invoked principles of federalism
and sovereign immunity to circumscribe the power of Congress to
identify problems in need of uniform national solutions.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration appealed the 4th Circuit decision, as
did the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, which has represented
Ms. Brzonkala throughout the case. The justices combined the two
appeals, U.S. vs. Morrison, No. 99-5, and Brzonkala vs. Morrison,
No. 99-29, and will hear the case in January. The court had already
scheduled arguments in three other federalism cases during its new
term, which officially begins next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Both halves of the 4th Circuit's analysis have implications
beyond the specific law at issue. On the question of Congress'
power to regulate interstate commerce, the appeals court relied on
the Supreme Court's ruling in a 1995 case, U.S. vs. Lopez, which
invalidated a federal law that made it a crime to carry a gun near
a school. In that case, the justices said that the activity
involved did not have a ``substantial relation to interstate
commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   In passing the Violence Against Women Act, Congress found that
violence against women did affect the economy by, for example,
limiting women's participation in the labor force. However, the 4th
Circuit rejected those findings, raising the question of the extent
to which federal courts should defer to the rationale offered by
Congress for its actions.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit's limitations on congressional authority to
legislate under the 14th Amendment raises potential questions about
the validity of civil rights laws enacted under that authority,
since those also apply to actions by private individuals who are
not ``state actors.'' The Clinton administration is arguing that
because the states themselves have failed to address the problem of
violence against women, the issue is one of official behavior and
not simply of private conduct.
</P>
<P>
   While the court ordinarily waits to review a case until a
disagreement has developed among the federal appeals courts, the
justices acted Tuesday in the absence of such a conflict. The 4th
Circuit was the first appeals court to decide the constitutionality
of the Violence Against Women Act, although the law has been upheld
by 14 federal District Courts.
</P>
<P>
   The law is familiar to the justices, although they have never
ruled on it. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist criticized it both
before and after its enactment, singling it out in speeches on the
new burdens that Congress was placing on the federal courts.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   This case was one of nine new appeals the court accepted
Tuesday. The cases, which will be argued in January, bring the
number of cases on the court's calendar to 44, well over half the
cases the justices are likely to decide over the nine-month
duration of the term.
</P>
<P>
   These were among the other new cases:
</P>
<P>
   _ Grandparents' Rights: The court agreed to decide the
constitutionality of a Washington state law giving grandparents and
other ``third parties'' the opportunity to petition a court for
visitation rights ``when visitation may serve the best interest of
the child.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Supreme Court, in a ruling last December,
declared the law unconstitutional as violating the fundamental
rights of parents not to have the state interfere with their
child-rearing decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Only where ``the state seeks to prevent harm or a risk of harm
to the child'' can the parents' fundamental right be overcome, the
state court said, adding that ``parents should be the ones to
choose whether to expose their children to certain people or
ideas.'' Even when there is a plausible argument that continued
contact with grandparents or other relatives, following a divorce
or the death of one parent, would be beneficial to the child,
``state intervention to better a child's quality of life through
third-party visitation is not justified where the child's
circumstances are otherwise satisfactory,'' the Washington court
said.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Troxel vs. Granville, No. 99-138, is an appeal by the
parents of a man who committed suicide after fathering two
daughters by a woman to whom he was not married. After the father's
death, the mother married a man who adopted the girls. The mother
and her husband then sought to limit the girls' contact with their
paternal grandparents, who invoked the state law and won regular
visitation rights under a decision that the Washington Supreme
Court then overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Most states have laws permitting grandparents and others to seek
visitation rights, and the state courts are divided over the laws'
constitutionality.
</P>
<P>
   _ Abortion Protests: The court agreed to hear a challenge to a
Colorado law making it a crime to approach another person within a
distance of 8 feet, while in the vicinity of a health care
facility, for the purpose of distributing leaflets, displaying
signs or engaging in conversation unless invited to do so. The
challenge was brought by three anti-abortion protesters who travel
to abortion clinics around Colorado for what they call ``sidewalk
counseling,'' trying to dissuade patients from entering the clinics
for their scheduled abortions.
</P>
<P>
   A Supreme Court decision two years ago, in a case from Buffalo,
N.Y., invalidated on First Amendment grounds a portion of a court
injunction that had imposed such a ``floating buffer zone'' to
shield abortion clinic patients from protesters. The Colorado law
was ``indistinguishable on any substantive basis,'' the lawyer for
the three protesters told the court in the new case, Hill vs.
Colorado, No. 98-1856.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the Colorado law in light of the earlier decision, the
Colorado courts nonetheless upheld the provision on the ground that
a law was entitled to more deference than a court injunction. The
law was a ``legitimate exercise of the state's authority to
restrict threatening conduct immediately outside health care
facilities,'' the state told the justices in its brief.

SHOWDOWN LOOMS ON REGULATION OF FOR-PROFIT NYSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Stock Exchange appears to be headed for
a showdown with the chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission over how the exchange will be regulated when it converts
to a publicly traded, for-profit business.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week after Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the SEC,
floated the idea of an independent, universal stock market
regulator, the New York Stock Exchange's chairman firmly rejected
the idea Tuesday, saying it would ``weaken investor protections and
do irreparable harm to the NYSE brand.''
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in Washington,
the market executive, Richard Grasso, also objected to the idea of
spinning off the exchange's regulatory function from an
investor-owned Big Board. This split would help eliminate some
conflicts of interest for its policing unit as the exchange takes
on the task of increasing shareholder returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the NYSE, our self-regulatory duties literally permeate
every part of the exchange,'' Grasso said in prepared remarks to
the committee. ``Severance of them would be both culturally and
practically impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   His seemingly unyielding position was surprising, given that the
SEC will have to approve a public offering by the New York Stock
Exchange. In fact, Levitt's concerns about the exchange's
regulatory structure emerged from its discussions about such an
offering.
</P>
<P>
   And while his refusal to compromise seemed to win Grasso friends
on the Finance Committee Tuesday, among them the chairman, Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, it could cause the New York exchange to fall
behind the NASDAQ stock market, which has announced a similar plan
to sell shares.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso's comments stood in sharp contrast Tuesday to the
testimony of Frank Zarb, chairman of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, the owner of the NASDAQ stock market, who told
the committee that he supported the idea of a single regulator.
</P>
<P>
   Having already separated its regulatory unit into an independent
organization, NASD thinks that the time is right to consider the
possibility of a single overseer of markets, Zarb said.
</P>
<P>
   That possibility was raised by Levitt, who said last week that
he was intrigued by the idea of a single self-regulatory
organization to oversee members, sales practices and all
intermarket trading for stock markets. In such a plan, each market
would maintain responsibility for the surveillance of its own
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Grasso's private beliefs may not be as rigid as his
public statements imply. In an interview after his testimony, he
said he expects that the exchange will not be able to complete its
planned conversion from mutual ownership to a publicly traded
corporation without reaching an agreement with the SEC over how the
regulatory function will be set up. Therefore, some compromise on
the issue will be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   And on another issue raised last week by Levitt, Grasso hinted
that the two of them agreed in principle, if not on all the
details.
</P>
<P>
   That issue involves what is known as Rule 390, a New York Stock
Exchange rule that prohibits Big Board members from dealing in
listed securities off an exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt said that the effect of the rule is to ``distort
competition and introduce artificial costs.'' One way or another,
he added, ``Rule 390 should not be part of our future.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question about Rule 390 at the hearing, Grasso
said, ``I have no intention of removing it right now.'' But in a
later interview, he said, ``The rule today is really without any
substance,'' and in fact, ``we may drop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Might there not be similar flexibility in Grasso's stance on a
single market regulator?
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The questions over how the securities markets will be regulated
reflect the uncertainty created by the rapid changes in the
structure of the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of electronic trading networks has begun to erode
the market share of the the Big Board and NASDAQ, forcing them to
respond. But each time they say they intend to make a quick
response to those competitive pressures _ first in regard to
after-hours trading, and then in ownership structure _ their plans
succumb to longer-than-expected delays.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the New York Stock Exchange itself has pushed back
the timetable for its conversion from a member-owned institution to
an entity owned by public shareholders. Where Grasso first
predicted such a move by Thanksgiving, he now says it will not
happen until the second half of next year.
</P>
<P>
   In part, that delay is caused by the need to make sure that
member firms have adjusted their computer systems to make the
transition to the year 2000, and in part to account for the change
of stock prices from fractions to decimals, which is scheduled to
begin next July.
</P>
<P>
   But the delay can also be traced to harder questions about
conflicts of interests at the exchange: Could market-surveillance
employees, for example, who owned stock in the exchange conduct
fair investigations of trading when news of a trading scandal might
drastically affect the value of their shares?
</P>
<P>
   Grasso insists they can. And, he said in an interview Tuesday,
the exchange might well establish a ``segregated subsidiary''
responsible for market oversight, which operates behind a Chinese
wall of separation from the exchange's profit-making business.
</P>
<P>
   Whether those plans will pass muster with the SEC remain to be
seen. Almost certainly, the answers will continue to evolve for
longer than anyone expects.

CONGRESS EXTENDS SPENDING BY 3 WEEKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs to clarify head)   (bl)  
 By TIM WEINER  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Unable to pass its appropriations bills before the
new fiscal year begins on Friday, Congress resolved on Tuesday to
keep federal agencies functioning for three weeks while Republicans
negotiate with President Clinton over hundreds of billions of
dollars of spending.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the stop-gap spending measure, called a continuing
resolution, has become a nearly annual event. Congress has met the
fiscal deadline only four times in the past 22 years. But this
year, the stakes are higher.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders vowed repeatedly to pass the spending bills
on time, keep them within spending limits Congress imposed in 1997,
and abstain from spending surplus Social Security money to run
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The first of those promises is now broken. The second will be
broken soon, according to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. And
the third _ the pledge to keep Congress' hands off Social Security
_ is very much in doubt, even though the House on Tuesday passed,
by a 417-2 vote, a non-binding resolution vowing not to spend the
retirement money.
</P>
<P>
   After that vote, Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., one of the staunchest
fiscal conservatives in the Republican ranks, said it was still
possible to keep Congress from spending Social Security surpluses.
``We have a strategy,'' Coburn said. ``We're working on it. We
don't know if it's going to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who routinely spent surplus Social Security money to
run government operations during most of the years from 1955
through 1994 when they controlled the House, where spending bills
originate, ridiculed the non-binding resolution, though almost all
of them voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt compared it to ``saying
we're going to quit smoking while we're having a cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   Debate on the continuing spending resolution was short and
occasionally bitter. Republicans said little as Democrats chided
them for the failure to pass the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., the ranking minority member on the
House Appropriations Committee, said the Republicans' rhetoric
about spending and Social Security was a form of fiction designed
to delude the American people. ``If it isn't a public lie, it is
the largest fib I have seen in a long time,'' Obey said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., the chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, who has worked hard but unsuccessfully
this year to keep the spending bills from being mired in politics,
said, ``Sometimes I wish that this were fiction, but it is not.''
</P>
<P>
   The continuing resolution passed the House by a 421-2 vote and
immediately went to the Senate, which approved it, 98-1, after an
equally desultory debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the years I've been here,'' said Senate Minority Leader
Tom Daschle, ``I don't recall a time when there's been greater
appropriations disarray than there is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Republican Congress and the White House must spend the
three weeks covered by the continuing resolution in the political
equivalent of hand-to-hand combat, fighting over how to spend
roughly half a trillion dollars of public money.
</P>
<P>
   As the continuing resolution was sent to Clinton, senior
Republicans in the House and Senate sought ways to find billions of
dollars to finance spending bills without tapping into Social
Security money.
</P>
<P>
   They still plan to take back $3 billion in welfare money from
the states, even though the nation's 50 governors _ 31 of whom are
Republicans _ oppose the idea and say Republican leaders promised
them this year that they would not touch the money. ``Congress is
breaking the commitment it made,'' the National Governors'
Association said on Tuesday in a letter to House leaders.
</P>
<P>
   And House Majority Leader Dick Armey said Congress could recoup
$8 billion by changing the way it pays out the earned-income tax
credit. He said the money could be saved by meting out this federal
tax break for working-class wage-earners in monthly payments
instead of in an annual lump sum.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Senate and House negotiators wrangled over a Pentagon
spending bill of nearly $270 billion, with Lott working to convince
the House to finance construction of a $1.5 billion ship in his
home state.
</P>
<P>
   Congress sent a measure financing energy and water projects to
the White House, completing work on the fifth of its 13 spending
bills this year. And Clinton issued the first of seven vetoes he
and his advisers have threatened against those bills, rejecting a
$4.7 billion measure financing federal operations in the District
of Columbia, saying Republican amendments to the bill violated the
principle of home rule for the capital. &QL;

FORWARDS 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year it was Luc Robitaille (39 goals) going it almost
alone, especially when Glen Murray (16 goals) was hurt. This
season, three-time 40-goal scorer Zigmund Palffy should provide the
left winger a boost, but No. 1 center Jozef Stumpel must return to
form. Stumpel had only 34 points last season, 45 fewer than the
season previous. &QL; 
Murray and Donald Audette (18 goals, 36 points in 49 games) are
quality wingers, but the second-line center spot remains up for
grabs. Journeyman Len Barrie, who played in Germany last year and
has only 64 games of NHL experience, has been pressing the
inconsistent Bryan Smolinski (16 goals, 40 points with the
Islanders). Ian Laperriere centers the checking line. &QL; 
DEFENSE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Kings couldn't sign Aki Berg; this season they
begin without Mattias Norstrom, who remains $300,000 apart from the
team and is squabbling over contract length. That leaves captain
Rob Blake without his safety net. Blake, who is coming off a subpar
season (12 goals, 35 points in 62 games), has made it clear he's
not too happy about that. &QL; 
Berg is back and eager to play, but the rest of the defense is
questionable. Sean O'Donnell is willing but limited by his lack of
mobility. Gary Galley is 36 years old. European veteran Frantisek
Kaberle is an NHL rookie. Jaroslav Modry and Philippe Boucher have
yet to prove they are full-time defensemen. &QL; 
L.A. was counting on Jere Karalahti, a highly regarded Finnish
defenseman, but his request for a U.S. visa has been delayed.
Karalahti was convicted of narcotics possession in 1996 in
Finland. &QL; 
GOALTENDING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This should be the team's strength if Stephane Fiset (a
career-best 2.60 GAA in '98-99) and Jamie Storr (2.40 GAA) stay
healthy. &QL; 
SPECIAL TEAMS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Kings ranked 24th on the power play last season and they
still don't have a proven quarterback to run it, even though Palffy
should help up front. &QL; 
The 14th-ranked penalty-killing unit was average at best, and
that's not good enough when the power play is so suspect. &QL; 
COACHING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt Andy Murray will do things his way. The
question is how long will his players listen and buy into his
detail-oriented approach, especially if the team struggles early
on. &QL; 
OUTLOOK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A playoff spot isn't out of the question, but neither is another
11th-place finish. &QL;

 2 Rivals Get FDA OK for Medical Patches  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The Food and Drug Administration yesterday approved two different
patches, developed by Bay Area scientists, that are designed to
repair the inner walls of weak blood vessels, preventing them from
bursting and causing death.
<P>
   The patches _ called stents in medical terms _ are meant to
treat abdominal aortic aneurysms, a condition in which a section of
the body's main blood vessel swells up, threatening to rupture and
cause a deadly hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   Some 15,000 Americans, most notably actor George C. Scott, die
each year because of such ruptures. Another 45,000 people, mostly
men over 65, undergo the surgery which was the only way to treat
such aneurysms before the FDA approved the two patch technologies
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The two systems approved yesterday are the culmination of years
of tests by the rival Medtronic Inc. of Minneapolis and Guidant
Corp. of Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific groundwork for both patching systems was done by
Peninsula startups, AneuRx Inc. and EndoVascular Technologies Inc.,
which were acquired by Medtronic and Guidant, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Zarins, head of vascular surgery at Stanford Medical
Center, is a clinical investigator and shareholder in Medtronic. He
explained how both systems worked and how they differed from
previous treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Before yesterday's FDA approval, the only way to treat aneurysms
was through surgery, Zarins said. Surgeons would slice open the
patient's abdomen, clamp shut the aorta, cut out the bulging
portion and graft in a section of polyester tubing to replace the
weak area of the aorta.
</P>
<P>
   The Medtronic and Guidant devices would eliminate that invasive
surgery, Zarins said. In both cases, surgeons will make a small
incision in an artery in the leg, and thread a catheter through the
blood vessels leading to the aneurysm. Guided by X-ray images, the
surgeon will position the tip of the catheter at the scene of the
bulge.
</P>
<P>
   But once they get in position, the rival systems will use subtly
different techniques to patch the weakened aorta.
</P>
<P>
   According to Zarins, the Medtronic stent is a 4- to 6-inch
length of a special alloy with a unique characteristic: it enlarges
when heated to body temperature. While being maneuvered into
position, the Medtronic stent will be covered to keep it cool. Once
in position, however, the surgeon will yank off the covering and
let the metal enlarge to fill the inner blood vessel wall, where it
will be held in place by friction, Zarins said.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Cole, general manager for the Guidant division in Menlo
Park, said his company's stent has two key differences. Once in
position, the Guidant stent is inflated by a balloon that is then
withdrawn with the catheter. The Guidant stent is also anchored in
place by tiny hooks at both ends.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the FDA has approved both techniques on the same day _
a rare regulatory feat _ Medtronic and Guidant will be free to tout
their competing techniques to the 3,000 U.S. vascular surgeons who
treat aneurysms.
</P>
<P>
   Cole said Guidant plans to charge about $10,000 for its stent. A
Medtronic spokesman said its stent would be competitively priced.
Both would cost far more than the $1,000 polyester tubes used in
graft operations. But the cost of treating an aneurysm _ now
$22,000 _ may not rise because recovery from patch operations takes
two days, whereas graft surgery immobilizes patients for over a
week.

 Foundry Stock Hits Solid Gold  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A little-known Sunnyvale company whose equipment lets Internet
service providers offer fast Net access soared 525 percent in its
first day of trading, eclipsing other Net companies that have gone
public this year with record-breaking success.
<P>
   Foundry Networks, which was priced at just $25, rose $131.25 to
close at $156.25 yesterday. The stock performance gives Foundry, a
networking firm with just 208 employees, a market value of $8.69
billion.
</P>
<P>
   It was the single biggest percentage gain for any company that
has gone public this year, according to David Menlow, president of
IPO Financial Network in Millburn, N.J. Only Theglobe.com, which
went public last year, had a bigger percentage jump on its first
day _ 606 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised, I'm astounded,'' Menlow said. ``It defies
explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   For all you armchair investors out there, if you had bought 100
shares of Foundry for $2,500, the investment would have been worth
a cool $15,600 by the end of trading yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Foundry's stock market success is that it plays
in the red-hot sector of Internet gear. Investors have been
clamoring to get a piece of almost any company that portends to
solve the World Wide Wait, driving the stock prices of obscure
networking companies like Juniper Networks and Alteon WebSystems to
record highs.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's Alteon, which went public last week, soared almost
300 percent in its first day of trading. Mountain View's Juniper,
which went public this summer, ended its first day up by almost 200
percent and is now more than 500 percent above its opening price of
$34. Alteon makes equipment to speed up traffic at Web sites and
Juniper makes gear that sends data quickly across the Internet and
other networks.
</P>
<P>
   Foundry makes equipment _ called gigabit Ethernet switches _
that helps ISPs and other companies manage heavy traffic on their
networks. The gear allows companies like America Online, Yahoo and
AT&AMP;T to avoid bottlenecks by giving them the bandwidth they need to
support a high volume of users.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very hot area,'' said Peony Kao, an analyst with
Renaissance Capital in Greenwich, Conn. ``It was a really highly
anticipated deal (because) Foundry is in the Internet networking
area, and it provides the switches that balance traffic over data
networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing that gave Foundry a boost is that it's different
from most other Net companies _ it actually makes a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Foundry earned $3.3 million for the six months ended June 30, up
from a loss of $4.2 million for the same period last year. It
reported revenue of $39.5 million this year, up from just $4.2
million in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a strong company. The management is strong, it's been
profitable and they project profits going forward,'' Kao said.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded three years ago by CEO Bobby Johnson,
who is now estimated to be worth about $2 billion after yesterday's
initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also co-founded another local company, Centillion
Networks, which was bought by Bay Networks in 1995 for $140 million
in stock. Bay was bought by Nortel Networks last year for $6.7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years, Foundry has amassed an impressive
customer list, with companies such as AT&AMP;T, AOL, Sprint and Silicon
Graphics all buying equipment from the networking firm.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ISPs, Foundry also sells gigabit Ethernet
switches to companies like Hewlett-Packard and NBC that want to
manage their local area networks more efficiently. Companies use
the networks LANs  &LR; to enable their employees to share software,
information and applications over a common network.
</P>
<P>
   Menlow, of IPO Financial Network, said Foundry's technology is
what helped it soar yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the technology that's really at the focus here. Gigabit
Ethernet is the wave that is overtaking the marketplace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But while the one-day success may make investors drool at the
prospect of more Net riches, Menlow cautioned people against a gold
rush mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foundry's performance is an incredibly positive statement for
the appetite of investors but it will also serve to give a sense of
confidence _ falsely so _ that all Internet stocks are of the same
ilk, and that's not the case,'' he said.

   ECUADOR ALLOWED TO DEFAULT AS WARNING FOR MARKETS
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's decision to let Ecuador default on
its debts is being interpreted as a message from Lawrence H.

 Lure of the Open Road _ Advertising  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Are there too many companies jostling for attention on the small
screen? DHL Worldwide Express, the Redwood City package courier,
thinks so and is responding by shifting its ads from the airwaves
to the highways.
<P>
   As part of efforts to commemorate the company's 30th anniversary
today, DHL said it will abandon image-building TV ads and instead
focus its marketing on brightly colored graphics plastered to the
sides of its 3,000-vehicle U.S. fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to break through the advertising clutter,'' said
David Fonkalsrud, a company spokesman. ``The consumer has become
desensitized to traditional ads. We're trying to reach them with
new forms of advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   DHL, of course, isn't alone in this effort. Golden Gate Bridge
directors are mulling an offer from CarOrder.com, an online car
dealer, to hang a marketing banner over the toll plaza in return
for paying all tolls one day a month, plus an extra $400,000 for
the bridge's coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Another online enterprise, Adauction.com, is looking to get at
commuters from a different angle _ from a floating billboard
dragged along the bay near Highway 101.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly innovative firms have taken to hauling billboards
around city streets from the backs of trucks, dressing up taxi cabs
and buses in loud corporate colors, and slapping their logos on all
manner of cheap freebie giveaways.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making new clutter,'' said Felipe Rubio, president of
Results Marketing Consultants in San Francisco. ``They're not
cutting through the clutter.''
</P>
<P>
   While Rubio does see merit in in-your-face ad campaigns, he said
limits need to be set on how, and where, corporate pitch making is
conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise,'' he said, ``there's going to be billboards
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   DHL is taking a slightly different tack. The privately held
company is trying to emphasize its status as a leading carrier of
international packages _ Federal Express is tops for domestic
shipments _ by highlighting overseas destinations on its trucks.
</P>
<P>
   By year's end, about three-quarters of the company's U.S.
vehicles will bear the name of some international locale, plus a
related image like Big Ben or the Eiffel Tower. A
pump-up-the-volume color scheme will ensure that the trucks get
noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For two years now, we've seen declining effectiveness for our
TV advertising,'' Fonkalsrud observed. ``It just wasn't having a
significant impact on customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, DHL will stick to some conventional marketing
techniques, such as ads in trade magazines.
</P>
<P>
   It will cost DHL about $800,000 to dress up its fleet _ a mere
fraction of the millions of dollars routinely spent for a
nationwide TV campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Fonkalsrud said the savings will be applied to purchases of new
aircraft and development of new shipping facilities.
</P>
<P>
   So is this blitz of new marketing ploys finally reaching
critical mass? Don't bet on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will only get worse,'' said David Roberts, head of
Strategic Marketing Communications in Redwood City. ``It's not
going to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that the typical American is bombarded by as many
as 3,000 corporate messages each and every day, according to recent
studies. This places the burden on companies to keep coming up with
unexpected ways to stand out from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are kind of immune to the standard advertising
sources,'' Roberts said. ``But when they're confronted by
unexpected sources, they notice.''

</HEADLINE>
 A BUSINESS   Pluses of Independent Contractors 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Q: When should a business hire an independent contractor instead
of an employee, and what are the benefits?
<P>
   &QL; 
A: It often is a good idea to hire an independent contractor if you
have a short-term project or job that requires a narrow set of
skills. For example, that could be a computer consultant to assess
your needs, set up your hardware and software and then come in to
service it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of independent contractors is that you have great
flexibility to do things,'' said Richard Harroch, a San Francisco
attorney and author of ``Small Business Kit for Dummies'' (IDG
Books, $24.99). ``You can bring in someone with specific expertise
for a specific period and you don't have to withhold taxes or give
them benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Tax laws allow you to treat employees and contractors
differently, and lower tax liability is one of the biggest
benefits. For independent contractors, employers do not have to
make Social Security and Medicare contributions, withhold taxes,
carry workers' compensation insurance, pay overtime or grant job
benefits such as vacation, sick leave or and  &LR; medical care.
</P>
<P>
   But don't try to classify regular workers as consultants or
contractors. ``If they look like other employees and the employer
has total control of and what they do and where they work and how
they work, you have to treat them like employees.
</P>
<P>
   To determine whether a worker is an employee or independent
contractor, the Internal Revenue Service offers guidance in IRS
Publication 1976. If you misclassify an employee as an independent
contractor, the IRS can make you pay not only unpaid taxes but
impose penalties and fines up to $100,000 and even send you to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Harroch notes that there are a few disadvantages in hiring
independent contractors. They can be expensive. You have limited
control over them and they lack the continuity that comes with a
more permanent relationship. Also, you are bound by terms of any
contractor agreement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
COMMUNITY VENTURE CAPITAL &QL; 
Most venture capital firms spend their time and money banking on
proven entrepreneurs with sterling track records and all the right
academic and business connections. But Silicon Valley Community
Ventures is a new nonprofit organization with a different tack.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of investing in high-tech startups, the San Francisco
organization is providing management advice and money to help
entrepreneurs grow businesses and create jobs in low-income
communities.
</P>
<P>
   SVCV is the brainchild of Bud Colligan, a partner with the VC
firm Accel Partners and former CEO of Macromedia, and it is backed
by some of the biggest stars in the VC firmament. Its board of
advisers includes John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers,
Dick Kramlich of New Enterprise Associates and Gib Myers of
Mayfield Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, wealthy entrepreneurs have contributed about $5
million to the nonprofit investment fund. As important as the
money, about 30 top executives have counseled 14 inner-city
entrepreneurs on how to build their businesses. For example:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seth Halio, vice president of finance for Spectra-Physics
Lasers, and Bob Serata, president of his own strategic marketing
firm, worked with Latte Dah Cafe, a drive-through espresso cafe in
East Palo Alto. SVCV has committed to make a $150,000 loan to the
cafe.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Ron Yara, co-founder of S3 and Chips &AMP; Technologies, joined several
other executives to help Apple-10 Products USA of San Jose develop
a business plan for making health and beauty products for African
Americans. SVCV loaned $25,000 to help develop its first product,
an aftershave lotion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Venture capitalist Cullen Coates advised Now and Zen, a vegan food
company in San Francisco's Bayview district that plans to
distribute its ``BBQ Un-Ribs'' and other products nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Wells Fargo Bank invested the first $5 million in a
new fund to provide equity financing to entrepreneurial, for-profit
companies in low-income communities in the Bay Area. The fund is
expected to grow to $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   SVCV President Penelope Douglas, a former Odwalla executive,
said the organization's goal is to provide ``one-on-one mentoring,
capital and others resources to target communities throughout the
Bay Area.'' It also works with other organizations that make loans
in low-income communities, such as the Small Business
Administration and Lenders for Community Development. For more
information, visit Web site, www.svcv.org.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NEW BIZ SITE: &QL; 
Each week, someone new announces a one-stop online business
resource specifically for entrepreneurs and small businesses. The
latest is &QL; 
www.bizzed.com created by financial services leviathan Citigroup.
Yes, the new site refers visitors to the usual array of services
from ``trusted bands,'' of companies that are primarily Citigroup's
business partners. But it also has some good information, such as a
primer on venture capital and 12 things that can kill a deal.

   As a 31-year-old entrepreneur, MacKinnon has become the grown-up
equivalent of that dormitory mix-master. While music megastores and
mall retailers push predictable Top 40 releases, MacKinnon's five
Hear Music shops promote a tasteful selection of limited-edition
jazz albums, underground rock 'n' roll, folk songs from Madagascar
and 11th century chant.
</P>
<P>
   Pop stars like Ricky Martin and the Backstreet Boys are there,
too, but tucked discreetly in a corner, like pornographic magazines
at a family drugstore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is so silly _ it's all about selling Ricky Martin
to teenagers,'' says the good-natured MacKinnon, who resembles a
thirtysomething Campbell's Soup Kid. ``There's no mechanism for
creating an album 15,000 people might love. The whole thing is kind
of broken.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKinnon's antidote is Hear Music. Unlike other music stores,
which are laid out strictly by category _ rock, classical, country
_ Hear, which is based in San Francisco, uses cross-genre
techniques to introduce people to recordings that they might not
otherwise come across.
</P>
<P>
   Listening booths around the store are arranged in themes, such
as Cowboy Music or Rainy Day Songs. Staff-written write-ups
accompany many offerings, adding a strong educational aspect to the
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Hear also has recruited well-known artists to introduce shoppers
to new selections. At each store's Artist's Choice booth, fans of
singer Tom Waits, for example, can listen to Waits' favorite CDs
and read his musings. (Describing the first time he listened to the
aria ``Nessun Dorma,'' Waits says, ``It was like giving a cigar to
a 5-year-old. I turned blue. I cried.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this store,'' says Deanna Dawson, a Web site producer,
interviewed recently in the San Francisco Hear. ``They pick out the
CDs and leave you to (explore). If I want to find something new, I
come here.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKinnon and his 12-person staff have spent more than two years
preparing a new, technologically savvy store concept, which debuted
in June in San Francisco's Metreon shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,500-square-foot shop features a long listening bar
equipped with digital scanners and computer screens.
Headphone-wearing shoppers can play any CD by waving it across the
scanner; simultaneously, write-ups of the CD and links to related
recordings appear on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Hear had established four stores, but further expansion was
stalled for several years as it worked with Sony Corp. to build the
listening bar's server technology. The same server will power an
ambitious Web site that launches today at www.hearmusic.com.
</P>
<P>
   Now MacKinnon is focusing on the company's next stage of growth:
expanding to between 75 and 100 stores nationally and a similar
number internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Hear Music's journey to the brink of the big time has been
something of a ... well, long and winding road. MacKinnon
co-founded the company as a music catalog in October of 1990, a few
months after graduating from Williams College in Massachusetts with
a degree in English literature. MacKinnon picked the featured
recordings and wrote the catalog's text. His partners, Kevin
Sheehan and Andrew McKee, recent Harvard Business School graduates,
handled the business side.
</P>
<P>
   While the catalog attracted a small, loyal following, the cost
of renting mailing lists proved too much of a burden for the
startup, then based in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The company also suffered from a fundamental problem: Because
most of the music it sold was by definition obscure, potential
customers had little idea what they might be buying. That made
mail-order much more difficult than for merchants of popular hits
or classical standbys.
</P>
<P>
   Music students armed with boom boxes staffed Hear's toll-free
line, playing tapes over the phone to interested customers. But no
amount of enthusiasm could overcome the hurdles _ or pay
MacKinnon's mounting credit card bills. The only way to make the
concept work was to open stores with listening booths, the founders
decided.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Hear Music, which at the time had 45 investors, was
acquired by CML Group, a retail conglomerate in Acton, Mass. CML
owned a fleet of well-regarded businesses including the Nature Co.,
Smith &AMP; Hawken and NordicTrack. Hear's young founders planned to
learn the art of retailing from CML and to share planning, stocking
and accounting resources with Nature Company of Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like a good idea at the time. But three years and 10
stores later, CML was in trouble and so was the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   While several street-front locations were quite successful,
including the original shop on Berkeley's Fourth Street and the
second location in Palo Alto, both of which still exist, others
were a disaster. CML, which since has folded, opened several
locations in suburban shopping malls that didn't attract Hear's
more urbane customer base.
</P>
<P>
   MacKinnon, who by that time had become Hear's chief executive,
found an outside investor, and the two bought Hear Music from CML
in October 1996, paying $371,000. They quickly closed several
stores, leaving just two in the Bay Area and one each in Santa
Monica and Chicago. Shortly thereafter, they began working on the
Metreon prototype.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is headquartered over an IHOP restaurant in a
grungy block of Mission Street, also signed a licensing deal with
Chapters, a book superstore chain in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year-and-a-half, Chapters has opened 12 Hear Music
boutiques within its bookstores. MacKinnon expects 25 more to open
north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Hear's mass rollout may be undertaken independently or with
partners. Sony intends to open three to five additional Metreons in
the United States and two or three abroad, which likely will
contain Hear Music stores, said Michael Swinney, president of Sony
Development.
</P>
<P>
   As a privately held company, Hear doesn't release financial
statements, but MacKinnon said total revenues hit between $5
million and $10 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sales per square foot at its U.S. locations came in at about
$700, which is two to three times the industry average. Meanwhile,
sales at the stores open at least a year rose a healthy 5 percent
last year and typically increase between 5 and 10 percent annually,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hear is not currently profitable due to the expense of launching
the Web site, MacKinnon said.
</P>
<P>
   As it contemplates a mass rollout, one obvious option for Hear
is to go public _ particularly if the Web site proves successful.
But Porter, the chairman of Telos Group, a conglomerate based in
Ashburn, Va., says that may or may not happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of capital if it's required,'' said Porter, a
Brit. One challenge the chain faces is a perception that its prices
are high. Several shoppers interviewed recently said they believe
Hear is more expensive than other stores, but a random comparison
with a nearby Virgin Megastore found that the stores' prices are
comparable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been a frustration of mine that people think we're
more expensive, and I think it's because it's such a nice store,''
said MacKinnon. At Hearmusic.com, prices will be somewhat lower to
compete with Web merchants and to help offset the cost of shipping,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   As for MacKinnon's future, Porter said he has no intention of
replacing the young entrepreneur with a more seasoned executive _ a
typical strategy when small companies face quick growth.
</P>
<P>
   MacKinnon is a smart businessman who exhibits the passion for
music that is necessary to maintain Hear's ``soul,'' Porter said.
``To get Hear to scale takes a lot of elbow grease and love and
care, and that's what Don puts in,'' Porter said. ``He completely
motivates his team.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who work with MacKinnon, who grew up in Short Hills,
N.J., also speak highly of him. ``Most of this time, he exudes this
childlike enthusiasm, but he has a command of numbers you don't see
until you get to know the deal side of him,'' said Swinney, who
worked closely with MacKinnon on the Metreon store.
</P>
<P>
   Music-industry experts say that despite the plethora of music
megastores in this country, there appears to be room for more Hear
Musics, particularly in cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've grown and been able to survive in a very competitive
market,'' said Saul Shapiro, vice president, sales and marketing
for Blue Note Records, a jazz label in New York. ``Despite growing
competition, they've been able to carve out their own little
niche.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On Wednesday night, in a Beverly Hills hotel
ballroom best known as the site of the Golden Globe ceremonies,
Warren Beatty, actor, writer, producer, director and Democrat, will
make a speech that his friends say will touch on global trade,
campaign finance and social justice. He may, or may not, say
something about running for president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The cheerleader-in-chief for a Beatty candidacy is Arianna
Huffington, a Republican political columnist not known for
embracing McGovern Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Among his kitchen cabinet of kibitizers and wordsmiths is
Patrick Caddell, the reformed pollster and strategist who advised
Jimmy Carter and Jerry Brown and now writes for ``The West Wing,''
a television series about the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Among the media throng expected to cover the speech is George
Stephanopoulos, the former White House aide who is now a political
analyst for ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   Could Hollywood make this stuff up?
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy enough to poke fun at Beatty, a legendary
lady-killer and famously diffident star who for 40 years has been a
cocky and enigmatic presence in the popular imagination, from
``Splendor in the Grass,'' to ``Bulworth.'' He is, after all, one
of the men about whom an old girlfriend, Carly Simon, wrote
``You're So Vain.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an age in which political careers are born, live and die
in the media, in which a former professional wrestler is governor
of Minnesota, an electronics billionaire from Texas has wrought
political havoc and the official biographer of the nation's last
actor-president fesses up to fabricating an entire narrative
persona in his new book on Ronald Reagan, Beatty is hardly a
laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very responsible person, who has a genuine love for
the Democratic Party and has over 30 years of activism in the
Democratic Party,'' said Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. of Chicago, one of
numerous disaffected politicians in both parties who have welcomed
Beatty's consideration of a campaign. ``But, like me, he doesn't
like the rightward drift of the party. Drifting to the right is not
the way Democrats win and make a difference in the lives of average
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The occasion of all the fuss is Beatty's planned acceptance on
Wednesday of the annual Eleanor Roosevelt Award of the Southern
California Chapter of Americans for Democratic Action, a civil
liberties group that had long sought to honor him. Beatty has the
opportunity at Wednesday's dinner to give his most extensive
comments on a possible candidacy since Ms. Huffington first
publicly floated the idea in her syndicated column seven weeks ago,
and he elaborated in a terse and elliptical Op-Ed piece in The New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Beatty declines to be interviewed for publication,
and insisted in an informal conversation the other day that he was
still unsure what he intended to say. He has told friends and
supporters that he does not flatter himself that the frisson that
has greeted his possible candidacy reflects anything other than the
power of his celebrity to shine light on a segment of thinking in
the Democratic Party that has remained largely unexpressed since
President Clinton successfully co-opted Republican themes in his
re-election strategy of ``triangulation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He always felt there was a candidate he could support in the
Democratic Party, and he no longer feels that way,'' said Frank
Mankiewicz, Robert F. Kennedy's former press secretary and one
friend of Beatty's. The two Democratic contenders, Vice President
Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, are ``nibbling around the
edges,'' Mankiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a Beatty candidacy came up in July at a dinner party
at Ms. Huffington's attended by Beatty and his wife, Annette
Bening.
</P>
<P>
   When other guests begin musing on the civic disconnection in
contemporary American life, someone suggested who better to tackle
that problem than J. Billington Bulworth himself. In that role,
Beatty plays a burned out senator so sick of mouthing poll-tested
platitudes that he takes a contract on his own life, then is freed
to tell the truth about political cynicism, corporate greed, racial
inequities and the state of American democracy.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, Ms. Huffington made the musing public, and
since then, Beatty has drawn supportive words from Washington
public interest groups and politicians of all stripes. Ms.
Huffington introduced him to Bill Hillsman, the media man for Gov.
Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, who flew out for a consultation.
</P>
<P>
   Both wings of the Reform Party have sounded him out (he says
he's not interested), and John Burton, the old-line San Francisco
liberal who leads the California state Senate has made noises about
endorsing a Beatty candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   With the Republican maverick Pat Buchanan poised to bolt to the
Reform Party, Ms. Huffington said the need for someone like Beatty
to offer an opposing voice is all the greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a professional storyteller,'' Ms. Huffington said.
``We've become so atomized and candidates are just addressing
pocketbook issues. All the candidates are talking about prosperity
and nobody really does talk about the public good, about justice
and sacrifice, all those big things that we haven't heard since
John F. Kennedy. And the need for someone to do that, for someone
who can pull the nation around the fire and draw us together as
we're being pulled apart, is all the more important with the
presence of Buchanan, whom I consider very dangerous and don't
underestimate at all.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Perversely, or perhaps predictably, Beatty's potential candidacy
is greeted far more skeptically in Hollywood than in Washington.
Here his rivals grouse _ under cover of anonymity _ that Beatty is
trying to divert attention from his next movie, ``Town and
Country,'' the story of a man in a midlife crisis, about which the
early buzz is bad. They say that he is a charming but politically
unsophisticated control freak who, at 62 with an apparently
blissful marriage and a fourth child on the way, could never stand
the invasive strain of a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's taken less seriously in Hollywood than anywhere
else, because people know him,'' said one colleague of Beatty in
the film industry who admires his work. ``Because people know him,
and if they know anything, it's that he's phenomenally
self-protective, risk-averse, and indecisive.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty has put himself on the line politically before, giving up
an entire year to raise money and campaign for George McGovern for
president in 1972, managing to get Art Garfunkel and Paul Simon to
set aside their feud for a McGovern fund-raiser. But friends say he
has usually been more comfortable behind the scenes, even in the
movies, preferring to work as director and producer and amassing a
fortune through canny business dealings. In the 1970s resisted
entreaties to run for governor of California despite promising
polls.
</P>
<P>
   He declined interviews altogether for most of the period between
``Shampoo'' in 1975 and ``Bugsy,'' in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren is the maestro of his own movements,'' said Caddell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is certainly not making the case that he has some unique
experience or qualification to run for president,'' Caddell said.
``He is saying there are very important things that are not being
said, and people have come to him because they think he might be
heard. I think that his real strength is to be a vehicle for people
who think they can have no impact, and can't be heard. In a sense,
that's a candidacy, not a candidate.''

LATE TO THE BATTLEFIELD: CULTURAL DEFENDERS OF THE FIRST
AMENDMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (with NY-MUSEUM) 
 (bl)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was until Tuesday, as you may have noticed, a
conspicuous silence on the part of almost all of the city's art and
cultural institutions about the Brooklyn Museum of Art debacle. The
directors of two museums, the Whitney and the Guggenheim,
previously made remarks generally supporting the notion of freedom
of expression _ while carefully avoiding any direct criticism of
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ but their statements were drowned out by
the noise from City Hall and the sounds of stumbling feet in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney and the Guggenheim, admirable though they are, are
also not the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern
Art, the two biggest art museums in town, whose refusal to comment
was, in effect, louder than anything that their smaller museum
colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, they finally denounced the ``chilling effect'' they
said was caused by the mayor's threats. But as the days had passed
and the debacle had grown into front-page news of an increasingly
familiar brand, their silence had become all the more striking. The
issue was becoming the sort of First Amendment battle that usually
provokes a pro forma reaction from the people whose livelihood is
culture _ even when some of those people may privately find the
exhibition in question, or parts of it, cynical and distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   Is it going too far to think that the general silence
contributed to the incident Monday, when Brooklyn Museum chairman
Robert S. Rubin seemed to entertain with city officials the notion
of withdrawing one of the disputed works from the exhibition?
Tuesday, as the museum instead decided to sue the city, Rubin
defended the show ``in the interests of all public institutions _
museums, universities and libraries _ that are dedicated to the
free exchange of ideas and information.'' But that was after some
twists and turns that were unexpected from a museum chairman.
</P>
<P>
   As Rubin, an investment banker, met with City Hall
representatives he may not have fully understood a basic,
uncompromising principle of cultural institutions, not to mention
the recent history of those institutions that have bowed to outside
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   When the Manhattan Theater Club, in the face of similar
criticism from the Catholic League _ and actual physical threats _
announced last year that it would delay its production of Terrence
McNally's ``Corpus Christi,'' it became a pariah of the theater
world until it reversed its decision. A decade ago, the Corcoran
Gallery in Washington was ostracized for canceling a Robert
Mapplethorpe exhibition after the show was criticized by members of
Congress. Perhaps if New York's cultural institutions had spoken up
sooner, Rubin might have grasped more clearly what was at stake and
would not have even discussed a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   There is always a moment when the terms of a public debate are
framed. For nearly a week, including the period of Rubin's
discussions with city officials, the mayor had been allowed to
frame the current issue almost by himself, an extraordinary gift to
a politician. Why did it take so long for the Cultural Institutions
Group, which includes the Metropolitan Museum and 32 other
city-financed institutions, to issue any rebuttal?
</P>
<P>
   Private e-mail among the group's members, provided by someone at
one of the institutions who wanted a stronger response, reveals a
mixture of timidity and confusion in the face of a notoriously
testy mayor, along with the desperate hope that the affair would
blow over. Publicly, a few members of the group said last week that
they did not want to interfere in negotiations between City Hall
and the Brooklyn Museum, but the e-mail shows that the group knew
from the museum's director that no discussions were under way then.
</P>
<P>
   There's a particularly arresting reference in one e-mail to City
Council Speaker Peter Vallone, who, having spoken out against the
mayor last Friday, was evidently shocked to find that the group had
not joined him. Its chairman, Alan Friedman, wrote last Friday that
he had called Vallone and told him privately how grateful several
members of the group were for his stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he appreciated that,'' Friedman reports, ``but he felt
very lonely. He was astonished that we had not acted in concert.''
Vallone warned him that the mayor's attack ``would set a precedent
for this mayor or any future mayor to cut off funding for any
institution which displeased him for any reason at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   But members of the group were too busy fretting about
retribution, with one of its advisers, Marty McLaughlin, remarking
in the e-mail that Giuliani tends to regard ``those who disagree
with him as enemies to be punished.''
</P>
<P>
   And it can't go without notice that, apart from its usual
funding, the Metropolitan, for example, has lately received $14.8
million from the city toward the renovation of its Greek and Roman
galleries and is currently promised an additional $30 million. The
Modern, which is not a member of Cultural Institutions Group but
signed Tuesday's statement, has received a promise of $65 million
toward its $650 million expansion.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt many institutions may have been uncomfortable with
defending an exhibition they didn't like. ``Sensation'' was shopped
to at least one other American museum, which declined it. Apart
from the issue of taste or morality that some works in it raise,
the show consists of art owned by a single private collector,
Charles Saatchi, the London advertising executive. The Brooklyn
Museum is, in essence, lending its imprimatur to Saatchi's
investments, which, should he wish, he could sell at any time. The
show's sponsor, by the way, is Christie's, the auction house.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern, by contrast, never presents any exhibition of a
private collection unless the collection is promised to the museum,
precisely to avoid this situation. One may imagine that the Modern,
and other institutions, wanted to be disassociated from an
enterprise that they regarded as commercial, not to mention tacky;
``Sensation'' has been promoted by the Brooklyn Museum with a
warning that its contents may cause shock, vomiting and confusion,
which among other things misrepresents and cheapens the good art in
it.
</P>
<P>
   To institutions like the Modern, the scenario was this: Giuliani
would win points with the conservative Roman Catholic constituency
that he wants for his Senate campaign. The Brooklyn Museum would
have lines around the block. Saatchi would reap profits from all
the publicity. Meanwhile, cultural organizations around the city,
embarrassed into defending the exhibition on First Amendment
grounds, would jeopardize their relations with a touchy City Hall
and alienate some of their own visitors and donors, who might
privately agree with the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, First Amendment battles don't always involve
clear-cut causes. Sometimes they require a little nose holding. The
culture wars are fought ultimately on principles that 18 members of
the Cultural Institutions Group, along with six co-signers, finally
articulated Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposed actions,'' their statement said, ``would set a
dangerous precedent for any mayor to revoke funding if he or she
finds even a single element of an institution's programs offensive:
one painting in an art museum, one exhibit in a science museum, one
performance in a theater, or even one book in a library.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether a pointed remark made so late in the
debate comes just too late.

 Ted Loos' most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about the
re-release of ``Caligula.''  
 By TED LOOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most actresses know that their careers are largely dependent on
their looks. But last year, Hilary Swank had to worry about her
appearance both as actress and actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely amazing what happens when a woman chops her
hair off,'' said Ms. Swank, who cut hers to play a woman passing as
a young man in the film ``Boys Don't Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting a haircut was the easiest part of the transformation she
had to pull off. In what is already one of the season's most
talked-about performances, Ms. Swank does more than convincingly go
male. She finds both the innocent and the rogue in Teena Brandon, a
young woman from Nebraska who abandoned her identity to embark on a
new life as Brandon Teena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys Don't Cry,'' opening on Friday, tells the tale of
Brandon, a true story that ended in 1993 when she was murdered by
two male friends enraged by the deception.
</P>
<P>
   The film's director and co-writer, Kimberly Peirce, said she had
searched for two-and-a-half years to find an actress who was right
for the part. ``There was no guarantee I could find someone who
could do what Brandon did,'' Ms. Peirce said, ``not only passing as
a man, but possessing the humor and bravado that Brandon did.''
</P>
<P>
   Casting the movie, which also stars Chloe Sevigny as Brandon's
girlfriend, made clear just how remarkable an actor the real-life
Brandon was. ``A lot of girls could act but not pass, and the rest
could pass but not act,'' Ms. Peirce said. The nature of the story
also kept some performers away. ``A lot of agents wouldn't send
their clients for the part,'' Ms. Peirce said. ``There was a stigma
attached.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Swank, an earnest 25-year-old who has been acting since
she was 16, the role represented a coming of age. She wanted it
precisely because it was leagues away from anything she had ever
tried.
</P>
<P>
   Her first movie part was the bubbly cheerleader who uttered the
immortal line ``That is (italics)so(end italics) five minutes ago''
in ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' (1992). Then she saved her high
school from villainous jocks as the lead in ``The Next Karate Kid''
(1994). More recently she had a seasonlong stint as Carly Molloy, a
single mother, on ``Beverly Hills 90210.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in jeans and a black leather jacket to talk about ``Boys
Don't Cry'' over breakfast in a midtown Manhattan hotel, Ms. Swank
recalled paying her own way to New York to audition. ``I really
wanted to play this part,'' she said, flashing a wide smile.
</P>
<P>
   Once she had got the role, she threw herself into preparing for
it, losing weight to make her facial structure more prominent and
working out to bulk up. She also practiced strapping and packing _
flattening her breasts and stuffing her pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took two months until I felt I was ready to play the
role,'' said Ms. Swank, who bears a remarkable resemblance to
Brandon on screen.
</P>
<P>
   But she did not stay at home in front of the mirror. She
ventured out in her Santa Monica, Calif., neighborhood in disguise,
introducing herself in a low voice as ``Hilary's brother James,''
not coincidentally the name of one of her grandfathers.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, the actor Chad Lowe, sometimes accompanied her,
gauging the reactions of friends and strangers. A husband from
another profession, she said, might not have understood. ``He was
really supportive; it was not an easy thing to go through,'' Ms.
Swank said. ``Once I got into it, I was fully there. I felt like I
lost every ounce of my femininity.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience of passing as a boy gave her a sense of the
confused emotions that might have motivated the killers. ``I was
treated so differently in public,'' said Ms. Swank, who noticed
that shopkeepers watched her suspiciously when they thought she was
a boy. ``If people couldn't define what I was, they didn't want to
have anything to do with me.''
</P>
<P>
   During the film's five-week shoot, which included violent scenes
in which Brandon is stripped and raped, Ms. Swank's fellow actors
were impressed by her commitment. ``I've done things for roles, but
that's further than I've ever gone,'' said Peter Sarsgaard, who
plays Brandon's friend-turned-murderer in the film. ``She really
lived it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ms. Swank had trouble getting oud of character.
``Sunday would come, our day off, and I would put on makeup and try
to be Hilary,'' she said. ``But I just looked androgynous. I
thought I was never going to be me again.''
</P>
<P>
   By the fourth week of filming, in Texas, Ms. Swank had to call
her husband and ask him to join her on the set. ``I told him I was
having a really hard time getting through this,'' she said. ``I had
to keep a little bit of distance from the fact that this actually
happened to someone.'' She said it had taken about three weeks of
rest among friends and family before she could ease herself out of
the role.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Swank connected to Brandon's story from the start. ``It
really hit home,'' she said of her first reading of the script.
``Here I am pursuing my dream of acting, and she was murdered for
her dream. Everyone can relate to that.'' Like others associated
with the film, Ms. Swank alternated between male and female
pronouns when discussing the character.
</P>
<P>
   She also has a coincidental connection to the story. Ms. Swank
was born in Lincoln, Neb., the city Brandon fled for Falls City,
Neb., in the hope of building a new life as a boy. Ms. Swank still
has family in Nebraska and Iowa, and she enlisted a cousin in Des
Moines as a dialect coach: he taped himself reading books to help
her acquire a a flat Midwest accent.
</P>
<P>
   Though she was raised mostly in Bellingham, Wash., Ms. Swank was
16 when she moved with her mother to Los Angeles to pursue acting.
``We lived on our Mobil card, eating at mini-marts,'' Ms. Swank
said of their journey south. But she soon landed the role in
``Buffy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she is looking forward to transforming her career. She is
already receiving scripts as a result of the favorable buzz about
her work in ``Boys Don't Cry,'' which was well received at the
Toronto International Film Festival and is part of this year's New
York Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, as an actor, you have to do some jobs to pay the
bills,'' she said of her experience moving from ``90210'' to a
serious independent film. ``But my next movie has got to be
something that I really love, now that I've gotten a taste of what
that's like.''

FORBES AIMS AT STRENGTHENING HIS GROUND TROOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Wealthy publisher Steve Forbes was the hare of the
1996 Republican presidential race, an idea-laden late-starter who
poured money into TV spots, but had no solid base of volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is running as a tortoise four years later, working the
GOP faithful while Texas Gov. George W. Bush flies high in the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``My object is to get the ground forces,'' Forbes said in an
interview Tuesday in the latest of a series of Seattle visits
stretching back to December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   His goal is to win over what Ronald Reagan called the
``conviction conservative'' in the GOP, unite the right, and go
head-to-head with Bush in such early tests as the caucuses in Iowa
and Alaska, the New Hampshire primary and Washington's primary and
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be a contest of the Republican establishment,
the capital lobbyists and commentators and insiders, versus a
principled outsider with a message,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has picked off organizers from former Rep. Linda Smith's
statewide organization, the right-to-life movement and other
conservative activists who have dominated GOP presidential politics
in Washington state for nearly a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' message still centers on his 1996 proposals for a
flat-rate income tax, and phasing in a new Social Security system
of retirement accounts that would let younger workers invest their
retirement money.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four years, however, Forbes has developed a
sensitivity to concerns of Republican conservatives to whom he was
suspect as a newly minted, libertarian-minded candidate in '96.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' litany of American freedoms now includes the ``freedom
to be born,'' with a proposal for the eventual criminalization of
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' advocacy of free trade includes a proposal for tough
conditions in U.S. dealings with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (Clinton) administration wants us to think the only
options are appeasement or a new cold war,'' he said. ``I want to
see rules of engagement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first is that we are going to stay in Asia, and are not
going to let them run us out,'' he said. ``We will hold them to
their promise not to use force in settling disputes with Taiwan. We
will continue to be critical of them on human rights. It is part of
our heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will tell China to reduce its own trade barriers, that
trade is not a one-way street. If China wants to sell nuclear
technology to rogue states such as North Korea, a price will be
paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, the publisher of Forbes magazine, is perhaps the only
GOP candidate with resources to match Bush's $50 million warchest.
There have been signs he is looking to turn assets into cash. An
island in Fiji, purchased by his flamboyant father, has gone on the
selling block.
</P>
<P>
   But there are indications his strategy is starting to work. He
finished a strong second behind Bush in Iowa Republicans' straw
poll. Forbes has lately welcomed a key convert, the national
campaign chairman, from the rival campaign of Christian
conservative activist Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle, also running on a
unite-the-right strategy, quit the GOP race on Monday. Commentator
Pat Buchanan is flirting with a run for the Reform Party
nomination. A key Buchanan backer in this state, Kay Regan, signed
up with Forbes on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes scoffs at opinion surveys showing Bush far ahead _
``Polls are impressionistic, they don't mean anything'' _ and
lampoons television commentators who say the GOP nomination is
wrapped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, as in business and finance, pundits are a lagging
indicator of trends ahead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes spent Tuesday's Seattle visit at a private luncheon and
meeting with supporters. He went on to Anchorage to court
conservative activists who dominate Alaska's Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   GOP activists will play a major role in selecting Washington's
delegation to next year's Republican national convention in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Only one-third of GOP convention delegates will be determined by
the outcome of the state's Feb. 29 presidential primary. Two-thirds
will be determined by March 7 precinct caucuses, historically a
stronghold of Christian conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has been the most frequent Washington visitor among GOP's
eight remaining presidential hopefuls. But he is getting
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain will kick off his campaign in the state
with a breakfast Thursday at Boeing Field. It will be McCain's
fourth Seattle stopover in the past five months.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will return to the state next month for a convention of the
National Federation of Republican Women, and be featured attraction
at an Oct. 16 Safeco Field fund raiser for Sen. Slade Gorton and
the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole will also attend the GOP womens' convention, as
will Forbes and McCain.

A DREAM UNFOLDS UNHURRIEDLY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3)

   DREAM OF LIGHT (QUINCE TREE OF THE SUN) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Victor Erice. 1990. Facets Multimedia. $79.95. 138
minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spanish with English subtitles. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certain things can be expected from a director who makes three
films in 30 years. Haste isn't one of them, nor is the slightest
deviation from detail. Victor Erice, a master of Spanish cinema,
needs almost two and a half hours to present his painstaking
creation, which in turn is the story of another creation that is
every bit as meticulous. Once one gets used to the fact that
there's no hurrying matters, there could well follow a desire to
give the film its head and let it go on forever.
</P>
<P>
   Erice prefers the English title, ``Quince Tree of the Sun,'' to
the American ``Dream of Light.'' Either way, his luminous
documentary, set in Madrid, goes into the back yard of the painter
Antonio Lopez Garcia to scrutinze the artist as he renders first a
painting and then a drawing of the tree and its fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, we learn, is in pursuit of a dream he had in childhood
about a mysterious group of people and quinces withering on a tree.
In the strong September light he sets up his easel close by the
tree and uses string to mark the plumb line and determine quadrants
on his canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny hash marks of white paint are carefully dabbed on the
leaves and the quinces. Later we learn that the marks indicate
precisely the original position of the leaves and fruit, which will
change as the quinces grow heavier and droop. Spikes are driven
into the soil, and every moment he is at work, Lopez plants the
toes of his shoes against them to be sure he remains the exact same
distance from his subject.
</P>
<P>
   September dissolves into October. We meet the artist's wife,
Maria, who is also a painter. Another artist drops by to discuss
the work in progress and to share tales of youthful experiences. As
his work forms on the canvas, Lopez himself emerges as a man with a
keen awareness of what he is about and after: the cycle of life.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious to capture the fruit at the exact moment of early autumn
light he remembers from long ago _ ``You can't believe how lovely
it was,'' he says _ he nevertheless refuses to hurry himself. As
the days pass, the light leaves. No matter. He starts all over
again with a drawing.
</P>
<P>
   As the new work takes shape, we watch him close in on a vision.
Visitors to the yard wonder about his obsession with physical
space. With warm fondness they lead him off to other pursuits, at
least for a little while. Later, Lopez has a young assistant prop
the leaves and fruit into position with a bamboo pole. His toes are
flush against the spikes in the ground. The pole brushes his nose.
</P>
<P>
   Should he look over or under it? Late fall arrives and the fruit
falls to the ground. Some of it is eaten by family and friends. The
rest withers, as it did long ago. &QL;

FROM A LITTLE SHOP OF RARITIES IN PARIS: 2,000 PHOTOS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   PARIS _ For decades, curators, collectors and dealers from
throughout the world came here to an antiquarian bookshop on the
Left Bank, the Librairie P. Jammes, where they climbed the circular
staircase to meet the owners, Andre Jammes and his wife,
Marie-Therese. They came to share the couple's expertise on
photography, a private passion that they pursued for more than 40
years, forming one of the finest collections anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a series of gifts and sales of their treasures to the
Bibliotheque Nationale and the Musee d'Orsay in Paris as well as to
the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, and the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York, the Jammeses have sent to auction much
of what is left of their ``magnificent obsession,'' said Philippe
Garner, the director of the photography department at Sotheby's in
London.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty of the most important photographs and albums are on
exhibit through Tuesday at Sotheby's in New York. The sale of the
collection, 2,000 images in 280 lots, will take place on Oct. 27 in
London. Sotheby's expects that the sale will total as much as $4.8
million, a record at auction for photography.
</P>
<P>
   But when Mr. and Mrs. Jammes began acquiring photographs,
neither they nor anyone else realized how prescient they were. ``In
1955, after a beautiful lecture on Nadar, we discovered that there
were no collectors and very few serious books on the history of
photography,'' said Jammes, 72. ``That was shocking for us.'' So
they decided to acquire early French photographs as a study
collection. Then the Jammeses documented the photographs as
thoroughly as they did the early printed books stocked in their
shop.
</P>
<P>
   They concentrated on 19th-century French photographers _ Nadar
(born Gaspard-Felix Tournachon), Edouard Baldus, Hippolyte Bayard,
Gustave Le Gray and Henri Le Secq. But they soon broadened their
focus to include other masters from the first century of
photography _ the Britons William Henry Fox Talbott and Julia
Margaret Cameron and the Americans Edward Steichen and Alfred
Stieglitz, along with foreign-born artists who worked in Paris:
Andre Kertesz, a Hungarian, and Man Ray, an American.
</P>
<P>
   Jammes became the collector, acquiring vast quantities of
photographs from booksellers as well as from photographers, their
estates and their families. Mrs. Jammes was the archivist,
recording the history, provenance and printing techniques used on
each photograph.
</P>
<P>
   They began to exhibit their collection in 1965, lending Man Rays
to an exhibition at the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris. (Among
them was an album of 12 Rayograms that had once belonged to the
Dada poet Tristan Tzara.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, they sent many 19th-century works to a show at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art, and in 1977, the Art Institute of
Chicago did a major exhibition of their collection, ``The First
Century of Photography.'' In 1983, the Jammeses sent 19th-century
calotypes, images from paper negatives, to Princeton University for
an exhibition that coincided with the publication by Princeton
University Press of ``The Art of French Calotype,'' a book by
Jammes and the art historian Eugenia Parry Janis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Daniel Wolf, a New York photography dealer, persuaded
the Jammeses, along with eight other collectors, to sell part of
their collection to an unnamed client that the Jammeses guessed was
the Getty Museum. ``We bought several thousand photographs from the
Jammes collection,'' said Weston Naef, the Getty's curator of
photographs. ``We got a little bit of everything _ French, British,
American photographs _ all, except their 20th-century pieces, that
most people did not know about then.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple also sold their collection of photographs by Nadar,
the pre-eminent French portrait photographer in the 19th century,
to the Musee d'Orsay. And in 1990, the Getty returned and bought
200 images by Eugene Atget.
</P>
<P>
   While Sotheby's auction offers none of Atget's poignant
photographs of simple landscapes, formal palaces and gardens and
eerie reflections in shop windows, the works of most other
photographers in the Jammes collection are represented in the sale.
The finest of the 16 images by Nadar are two portraits from 1855:
one depicts the illustrator Gustave Dore as a dashing fellow in a
checkered scarf; the other shows the mime Paul Legrand as an
astonished clown.
</P>
<P>
   Each is expected to bring up to $28,800. Two albumen prints by
Le Gray from 1855 are nature studies: in ``Beech Tree,
Fontainebleau,'' a huge, gnarled tree seems to swallow the
landscape, and in ``Seascape in Sete'' the sun expands both the sky
and sea. Each is expected to sell for as much as $96,000. The power
in Bayard's self-portrait from 1850-55 is in the tightly controlled
setting showing him at work with his camera.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest photograph in the sale, the bluish ``Pantheon,
Paris'' by Vincent Chevalier, is a whole-plate daguerreotype that
Daguerre's longtime lens-maker tok on Oct. 2, 1839. It was just
six weeks after Daguerre's photography process was announced to a
crowd in front of the French Academy of Sciences in Paris.
Sotheby's expects that the photograph will bring as much as
$32,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sale has the wonderful feel of an insider's collection,''
Naef said. ``It turns back the clock to the late '70s and '80s,
when so many early photographs were being exported from France. And
that makes it seem very refreshing and exciting.''

CROSSING MUSIC'S BORDERS IN SEARCH OF IDENTITY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ What is jazz? Throughout the 1980s, New York's
downtown improvisers delighted in dancing around this question. Not
that it should ever have been posed to them.
</P>
<P>
   Although inspired by free jazz, the saxophonists John Zorn and
John Lurie, the songwriter Arto Lindsay and the guitarists Marc
Ribot and Bill Frisell were not quite jazz musicians. They were
installation artists whose raw material was sound; they scavenged
for quotations from their vast record collections and from the
city's musique concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Performing at clubs like the Knitting Factory, Roulette and the
Gas Station, these musicians created a deliriously referential,
post-modern pastiche of genres that ranged irreverently across free
jazz, punk rock, classical modernism and B-movie soundtracks and
that collapsed the boundaries between high and low culture at a
time when those boundaries still meant something. Their music was
identifiable mainly by its sly repudiation of a genre-based
identity.
</P>
<P>
   All that is now history. In the last few years, the New York
downtown school has undergone a startling mutation, albeit one not
immediately audible to the innocent ear. Clubs like the Knitting
Factory and Tonic still feature many of the usual suspects, some of
them now approaching 50.
</P>
<P>
   The music has largely retained its brash, collage-driven spirit.
But beneath the appearance of continuity, a paradigm shift has
emerged. Once known for their rootless cosmopolitanism, downtown
musicians are now passionately searching for roots _ not
necessarily their own.
</P>
<P>
   The prime architects of the new sensibility are Zorn, who now
considers himself a Jewish composer, and Lindsay, whose new record,
``Prize,'' is the fourth in a series of albums inspired by
Brazilian popular music. But these are just two examples of the
intense curiosity about ethnic music that has gripped the downtown
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban popular music has served as a major source of inspiration
for downtown veterans like Ribot, now the leader of a band called
Los Cubanos Postizos, and the producer Bill Laswell, who has just
released an album of remixes called ``Imaginary Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Hwang, a Chinese-American free-jazz violinist who used to
play with the saxophonist Henry Threadgill, has formed a pan-Asian
improvising group, the Far East Side Band. The folk styles of the
Baltics and the Middle East, meanwhile, have strongly influenced
downtown musicians in their 20s and 30s, like the guitarist Brad
Shepik, the clarinetist Chris Speed, the drummer Jim Black (who
form the trio Pachora) and the ubiquitous trumpeter Dave Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the examples are analogous, of course. Some of these
musicians are investigating their ancestral traditions, while
others have no personal connection to their adopted styles. But
what unites them is an interest in music that evokes a community of
listeners bound by region, nationality or religion _ music that has
an identity.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown music has changed partly because New York has. Even
below 14th Street _ no, especially below 14th Street _ Manhattan is
no longer the edgy place depicted in Martin Scorsese's 1985 film
``After Hours,'' in which Starbucks wasn't ubiquitous and the
streets gave off a nervous spark.
</P>
<P>
   The Knitting Factory, now a mini-empire in TriBeCa, is part of
the arts establishment; ``Knitting Factory music'' denotes a period
style that is about as provocative today as Keith Haring's graffiti
murals.
</P>
<P>
   The aging of the downtown scene, along with its gentrification,
has led musicians to find new, unco-opted forms of energy in world
music. The current explosion is somewhat reminiscent of rock in the
1980s, when white stars afflicted with wanderlust surrounded
themselves with musicians from the Middle East (Peter Gabriel),
Brazil (David Byrne) and South Africa (Paul Simon). The difference
is that downtown musicians don't have the same obsession with
authenticity; their work is pointedly hybridized.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they are trying to tap into the almost magical
power that cultural identity possesses today.
</P>
<P>
   When Zorn performs with his free jazz band Masada at a synagogue
on the Lower East Side, or when the Brazilian-reared Lindsay sings
in Portuguese before an audience of samba fans and Brazilian
emigres, there is an almost palpable feeling of intimacy among
strangers, of community, that goes beyond esthetic pleasure. Such
music reflects an effort to provide audiences with a home in the
world, a coherent sense of place in a musical scene that has grown
bewilderingly global.
</P>
<P>
   And not just audiences, apparently. Zorn and Lindsay, who are
both in their late 40s and who occasionally play together, have
sought to find themselves _ and to moor themselves _ in the house
of ethnic identity. Their convergence is doubly significant, since
both musicians have an uncanny knack for predicting the next wave
and the power and influence to direct it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being the downtown school's best-known musicians,
Zorn and Lindsay are its pacesetters, translators, ambassadors and,
not least, its savviest entrepreneurs. Zorn runs an experimental
music label, Tzadik (Hebrew for righteous man). Lindsay has
performed with Tom Ze, the Tristan Tzara of Brazilian Tropicalia,
and Vovo, the leader of the black nationalist carnival band Ile
Aiye; Lindsay has also produced recordings by Caetano Veloso,
Carlinhos Brown and Marisa Monte.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what led Zorn, a secular Jew from Queens, to his
awakening. In interviews, he has spoken vaguely of getting hostile
looks in Germany and of his father's death. What is certain is that
Zorn's study of Jewish history has transformed him and his music,
with results that are at once captivating and disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish themes have inspired some of his best, most rounded work.
The exuberantly ironic jump-cutting compositions that made Zorn's
reputation in the 1980s, notably ``Spillane'' and ``Godard,'' had
no central narrative, apart from the city's teeming energy.
</P>
<P>
   With Jewish identity, Zorn has hit upon something that holds and
concentrates his attention. In improvisational chamber works like
``Bar Kohkba'' and ``Issachar'' that conjure up the vanished world
of the shtetl with wit and sorrow while suggesting the affinities
between jazz and Jewish folk music, Zorn is a fine, patient
storyteller.
</P>
<P>
   He is by no means the first composer of Jewish ancestry to
examine his heritage: Leonard Bernstein did so in ``Kaddish,''
while Steve Reich has addressed the Holocaust and the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict in, respectively, ``Different Trains''
and ``The Cave.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zorn stands out in his attempt to cultivate a
self-consciously Jewish tradition. His band Masada is named after
the hill fortress where a group of first-century Jewish warriors
committed suicide rather than surrender to the Romans. The titles
of his compositions often evoke Jewish victimhood _
``Kristallnacht'' being a particularly explosive example.
</P>
<P>
   As a producer, he has presided over a thriving subgenre of
``radical Jewish music,'' including the trumpeter Steve Bernstein's
coyly atmospheric arrangements of cantorial songs and the
avant-garde klezmer of the clarinetist David Kracauer.
</P>
<P>
   Zorn's Jewish music reflects a deeper trend in the Jewish
community described by the historian Peter Novick in his new book,
``The Holocaust in America.'' Novick argues that an
``integrationist ethos'' that emphasized what Jews had in common
with other Americans has given way to a ``particularist ethos,''
emphasizing group identity, Israel and Holocaust memory.
</P>
<P>
   From his klezmer borrowings to the Hebrew-lettered shirts he
wears in concert, Zorn repudiates assimilation and dramatically
departs from the way American Jewish musicians have handled the
question of their identity.
</P>
<P>
   Among American minorities, only blacks have shaped this
country's musical culture more than Jews. But Jews like Irving
Berlin, George Gershwin and Stephen Sondheim have used music
primarily as a vehicle of Americanization rather than ethnic
self-assertion. Jewish jazzmen like Stan Getz and Steve Lacy have
regarded themselves not as ``Jewish musicians'' but as white
practitioners of an art largely created by blacks _ as participants
in one of America's few genuine experiments in cultural
integration.
</P>
<P>
   Until Zorn discovered klezmer, the only jazz musician to show
much interest in Eastern European soul was the black clarinetist
Don Byron.
</P>
<P>
   Zorn hopes to simplify the problem of ``Jewish music'' by
invoking an atavistic form of identity politics. Under the heading
``Great Jewish Music,'' for example, he has compiled album-length
tributes to musicians whose Jewish ancestry is incidental, if not
irrelevant, to their work, notably the French chanteur Serge
Gainsbourg and the proto-punk guitarist Marc Bolan.
</P>
<P>
   In part this is something of a prank, like Lenny Bruce's skit
about the spread of the Jewish urban sensibility. (``If you live in
New York, you're Jewish, even if you're Catholic. If you live in
Butte, Montana, you're goyish, even if you're Jewish.'')
</P>
<P>
   But Zorn's celebration of Gainsbourg and Bolan ultimately rests
on a racial definition of Jewish music that Jews have battled since
Richard Wagner published his notorious tirade ``Judaism in Music,''
in 1849. The fact that this definition is now being pressed into
the service of tribalism rather than anti-Semitism is little
consolation.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Zorn has spoken in almost hallucinatory tones about
what it means to be Jewish in America. Using language better suited
to 1920s Weimar than 1990s Manhattan, he has portrayed Jews as
``the world's outsiders,'' adrift in ``host cultures'' that will
never accept them.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine that Zorn, a consummate insider who is
nearly as powerful downtown as Wynton Marsalis is uptown, sincerely
believes that New York, the cradle of postwar Jewish culture and
power, is a ``host culture'' to Jews. The corollary to this view,
of course, is that the only authentic Jewish life is in Israel, a
conclusion that the composer, who is a longtime resident of the
East Village, apparently rejects.
</P>
<P>
   Zorn is committed to the idea of Jews as an eternal pariah
class, even in the face of considerable evidence to the contrary.
In a recent interview with the jazz magazine Jazziz, he exhorts his
fellow Jews to ``identify themselves as Jews'' and stop ``passing
for white,'' oddly echoing the rhetoric of some black jazz
musicians in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that for Zorn, Jewishness answers to a deeply felt
desire _ a desire not to be a white jazz musician. By invoking his
own history of oppression, he can assert his right to play the
blues, without the racial envy that often burdens white musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, his attempt to recast Jewishness as a defiantly
marginalized identity _ to claim victim status _ has an air of
calculation about it that overpowers his music. Ultimately, Zorn's
Jewishness will be primarily of interest to scholars of ethnicity.

`FLESH-EATING BACTERIA' DEATH LINKED TO HEROIN USE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A 39-year-old woman from Walla Walla died this weekend
at Harborview Medical Center from a ``flesh-eating'' bacterial
infection brought on by heroin use, public health officials have
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Despite surgical removal of dead and infected tissue from both
her arms, Linda Key died Sunday from a systemic infection that
could not be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Timothy Pohlman, the Harborview surgeon who attempted to
save Key, said half of all patients stricken with this rare but
severe and life-threatening infection _ more accurately known as
``necrotizing fasciitis'' _ appear to acquire it through injection
drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be useful to know if it turns out there's a higher
association among this particular group of people,'' said Pohlman,
noting that injection drug use appears to be increasing in the
Puget Sound region.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, San Francisco public health officials dealt with a
rash of cases of necrotizing fasciitis, and deaths, among
intravenous drug users. Bacterial contaminants in injectable drugs
such as black tar heroin and methamphetamines were blamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This death is a real scare because we thought we didn't have
the problem they've been having in San Francisco,'' said Ron
Jackson, director of Evergreen Treatment Services, which provides
treatment for heroin addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, a group of heroin users in Seattle were admitted to
Harborview with this life-threatening infection acquired through
bacterial contaminants in the drug. They survived, Pohlman said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not known how the Walla Walla woman became infected,
whether through a dirty needle, tainted drug or simply by bacteria
on her skin that entered her body through the puncture wound.
Authorities also don't know if any other drug users may be at risk
from a bad batch of heroin, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to know unless you track this,'' Pohlman said.
Key was the first of his patients to die from the infection among
those known to be addicts, he said. A spokesman for the King County
Medical Examiner's office, however, said there have been previous
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Hard numbers are hard to come by because unlike HIV, hepatitis
or E. coli O157, doctors are not required to report necrotizing
fasciitis to public health authorities.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, not much is known about the link between heroin
use and necrotizing fasciitis beyond the anecdotal reports and
personal experience of people like Pohlman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean we don't take it seriously or respond to a
cluster of cases,'' said Dr. John Kobayashi, senior epidemiologist
for the state Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with cases of ``flesh-eating bacteria,'' Kobayashi
said, is that they are very rare and seldom related because of the
typically non-communicable nature of this illness.
</P>
<P>
   An unusual cluster of five fatal cases identified in Spokane
last January all caused by streptococcal bacteria were investigated
by public health officials as a possible outbreak, he said. But
genetic analysis showed they were unrelated, he said, so it was
simply a tragic coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a dozen or two cases that occur in Washington
state every year,'' Kobayashi said. There can be a variety of
bacteria involved, he said, because the illness is caused not by
any particular type of organism but by where the bacteria infect in
the body.
</P>
<P>
   Necrotizing fasciitis can result when bacteria like strep or
staph are introduced into a blood-poor region of the body known as
the fascia, the connective tissue between skin and muscle. If an
infection takes hold, tissue dies off rapidly because of poor blood
flow and an inability to fight off the rapid bacterial progression.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed ``flesh-eating bacteria'' when it was first reported in
the media, the infection can destroy tissue at the rate of an inch
per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Two other people have been reported hospitalized in Seattle with
necrotizing fasciitis, neither of them known to be associated or
linked in any way with the Walla Walla woman who died.
</P>
<P>
   One is a 31-year-old woman from Goldendale at Harborview who
remains in serious condition. A man, whose family asked that no
details be released, was transferred from an Olympia hospital to
the University of Washington Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   While any case of ``flesh-eating bacteria'' is of serious
concern, some contend those cases linked to injection drug use may
warrant special attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among injectors, the potential for rapid spread is great,''
said Michael Hanrahan, coordinator of the seven hypodermic needle
exchange programs operated by Public Health - Seattle and King
County.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Hanrahan said, it would be better if people stopped
using illicit drugs or at least used clean needles. But given the
reality, he said, there may be reason to track outbreaks of this
infection if only to try to prevent its further spread among drug
users.

 NEW YORK: of ethnicity.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike Zorn, the guitarist and songwriter Arto Lindsay gives the
sociologists little to chew on. Pleasure, rather than pedagogy, is
the aim of his erotically charged love songs in which fractured
poetry floats over a lush, perpetually mutating backdrop of
Brazilian popular music, guitar noise and drum-and-bass.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay is not Brazilian, but he spent his formative years in
Brazil, where his parents were Roman Catholic missionaries. He grew
up bilingual and absorbed early on the influences of Caetano Veloso
and Gilberto Gil. As a co-leader (with Peter Scherer) of the art
rock group Ambitious Lovers, he wrote a few songs in Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until his 1996 recording ``O Corpo Sutil'' (``The
Subtle Body'') that he began mining the music of his Brazilian
childhood. After four such albums, each more daring than the last,
it's clear he made an inspired decision.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay isn't much of a guitarist, or even a musician, as he
himself admits with more than a touch of pride. (As a member of the
pioneering ``no wave'' band DNA in the early 1980s, he deftly
turned this defect to his advantage, earning a certain cachet for
the only sound he could reliably produce, a screeching distortion
now officially known in experimental music lingo as skronk.)
</P>
<P>
   But he is a stylish lyricist with a fine, deadpan voice, a
superb ear and a gift for assembling talent. On his last few
records, he has recruited an international dream team that includes
the Venezuelan producer Andre Levin, the bassist Melvin Gibbs of
Henry Rollins' band, the guitarist Vinicius Cantuaria (whose career
he has in turned helped to relaunch) and the Japanese keyboardist
and composer Riyuichi Sakamoto.
</P>
<P>
   The result is inadvertently but aptly described by a song on his
new record, ``Prize,'' as a ``subatomic machine where influences
breed.''
</P>
<P>
   The music on Lindsay's most recent albums occupies the border
between Brazilian and American pop, but then so does the music of
Brazilians like Carlinhos Brown. Lindsay's originality does not lie
in the fact that he crosses borders, but in his graceful,
unpretentious way of moving back and forth between his two
homelands.
</P>
<P>
   In albums like ``Mundo Civilizado'' and ``Prize,'' he has
seamlessly blended bossa nova and samba rhythms with rattling drum
samples, jazzy horn arrangements and the occasional skronk
explosion. As a lyricist, he doesn't seek to unveil the truths of
Brazilian or bicultural identity, whatever these might be.
</P>
<P>
   He prefers more personal (often sexual) kinds of illumination.
The songs on ``Prize,'' by turns clever and naked, suggest someone
torn between painful self-consciousness and a desire to surrender
to pure feeling (``Don't take fear too far/Let love be salacious,''
goes the chorus of one song.) Could this be the predicament of a
missionary's son in the tropics? Perhaps, but that hardly does
justice to Lindsay's acute, funky portraits of urban rapture in all
its beauty and violence.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem contrived that Lindsay, who would never be mistaken
for a Brazilian, sings a great deal of his material in Portuguese.
But he is not doing so for novelty's sake or to strike a pose. It's
simply a language in which he enjoys expressing himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prize'' is stamped by its creator's identity, but it's not the
kind that turns up in census reports. Like the best pop, Lindsay's
neo-Brazilian music carves out its own figurative landscapes of the
soul. It comes from ``way down inside/in some interior life,'' as
one of his new songs says. The urgency of his exploration of
identity is musical, not ideological.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Zorn, Lindsay understands that it is not enough to affirm
one's roots; one must make something of them. Like all source
material in improvised music, identity is no more than a point of
departure. When it becomes the destination, as in Zorn's music, the
result is simply radical kitsch.

DAME EDNA SPEAKS HER MIND, AND YOURS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK DeCARO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She sat alone at a small round table in what Barry
Humphries would later call ``that strange spooky room above
Sardi's,'' dressed in a sequined frock that had more going on than
the Times Square redevelopment project.
</P>
<P>
   The facade of Radio City Music Hall was appliqued on one
shoulder, an embroidered Broadway zoomed up the other, and her
eyeglasses _ the so-called face furniture that is so much a part of
her look _ were reminiscent of another imported lady, the Statue of
Liberty. With a torch at one temple and a row of spikes at the
other, the glasses make air-kissing an extreme sport. This was, of
course, her idea of New York day wear. At night, Dame Edna Everage
goes all out.
</P>
<P>
   The Melbourne, Australia, housewife turned international
megastar _ who may or may not be Humphries in drag (she says no, he
says yes) _ had shown up for lunch that day to discuss her
not-quite-one-woman show ``Dame Edna: The Royal Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   In previews at the Booth Theater, where it opens on Oct. 17,
``Dame Edna'' is the Broadway debut of a cross-dressing character _
one must side with Humphries' version of the story _ whose
``natural wisteria'' hair color, and penchant for gladioli and
calling her audience possums are more famous in Britain and her
homeland than the drag queen Ru Paul is here.
</P>
<P>
   Although less well-known in America than in any other
English-speaking part of the world, Dame Edna has so far had no
trouble drawing a celebrated audience. ``I'm a luxury item. I'm
caviar. A special interest for the discerning few,'' she said of
her stateside status. Sylvia Miles, Monique Van Vooren, Michael
Feinstein and Isaac Mizrahi _ celebrities of a certain quirky ilk _
have already been to the Booth to see her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was determined to find a rhyme for Mizrahi,'' said
Humphries, 65, in an interview separate from Dame Edna's, a few
days after the fashion designer had been in his audience. As her
pianist, Andrew Ross, played ``Any Friend of Kenny's Is a Friend of
Mine,'' an anthem of motherly pride for a possibly gay son, Dame
Edna ad-libbed, ``I have to say so far, he hasn't met Isaac
Mizrahi.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, Mizrahi was likely to have heard Dame Edna talk of
her late husband, Norm, who met his maker only after years in an
``iron prostate,'' and of her mother, an albatross long confined to
a ``maximum security twilight home.'' There are Edna's children to
talk about, too _ her beloved son Kenny, a dressmaker who recently
relocated to the Chelsea section of Manhattan; his brother, Bruce,
a feng shui specialist, and Edna's estranged daughter, Valmai, who
now lives with a former East European tennis player and breeds pit
bulls in Flushing.
</P>
<P>
   All are characters in the Dame Edna mythology, a meticulously
detailed, carefully spun yarn that filled 284 pages of a 1989
``autobiography'' called ``My Gorgeous Life.'' Humphries'
autobiography, ``More Please,'' was published in 1992. Both life
stories continue to evolve.
</P>
<P>
   But when Humphries showed up at Oscar's restaurant in the
Waldorf-Astoria for a recent brunch _ nattily dressed in a gray
made-to-measure suit and a blue zigzagging tie _ it was a member of
his audience less celebrated than Mizrahi about whom he was
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other night I scared a very nice woman who looked like she
was from Long Island,'' he said. ``I don't think she was ready for
it. By intermission, she was gone.'' This doesn't usually happen,
even when Dame Edna tells a woman in the third row, ``I used to try
to make my own clothes, too.'' Or when she lambastes a latecomer
with ``I came all the way from Australia and I got here on time.''
``The ones who get away are few, but they do distress me,''
Humphries said.
</P>
<P>
   Dame Edna has that shriveling effect on the weak willed because
she often says what others feel guilty about even thinking. ``I
don't know how Edna does it,'' Humphries said of his creation's
candor. ``But she is sure that people hear the caring in her
voice.'' In other words, everything Dame Edna says, she says from
love. Her motto is ``I'm sorry, but I care,'' a belief that once
justified her imploring Jane Seymour, ``Tell me the secret of your
successful marriages.''
</P>
<P>
   Dame Edna's classic television moment, however, came when she
asked Roseanne, ``Is there anything you wish you hadn't eaten?''
That clip, along with a glimpse of Edna's long-suffering sidekick,
Madge Allsop, her 93-year-old bridesmaid and sometime Ed McMahon
counterpart, appear in a video montage detailing Edna's rise to
megastardom at the opening of ``Dame Edna: The Royal Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Humphries recalls, Edna began when, as a member of
an Australian acting troupe, he wrote a housewife sketch. ``She was
a character created in 1955 for a revue that was going to last a
couple of nights,'' he said. ``The character was not intended to
have legs. I really wrote it for Zoe Caldwell to do.'' But his
reading was funny and the director suggested that Humphries go on
in drag. ``If Zoe had played it, she'd be doing the show at the
Booth and I'd be doing `Master Class,''' he mused.
</P>
<P>
   When Humphries moved to England in the 1960s, he temporarily
dropped his Australian act, which included such characters as Les
Patterson, a ``prodigiously endowed'' Australian cultural attache,
and Sandy Stone, an old man of the suburbs who, he said, is Edna's
male counterpart. As an actor, he played Fagan in a 1967 revival of
the musical ``Oliver'' in London.
</P>
<P>
   He reprised his duties when the musical opened on Broadway, at
the same time moving into a cold-water flat in Greenwich Village
and befriending some of the era's best known bohemians, including
Jack Kerouac. In 1972, he appeared as Edna Everage in Bruce
Beresford's first film, ``The Adventures of Barry McKenzie,'' based
on a cartoon strip that Humphries had written.
</P>
<P>
   Dame Edna first came to the New York stage in the 1970s. ``She
was looking more like a star and less like a housewife,'' Humphries
noted. Although she had made her name in various one-woman shows in
London, she was an unknown commodity here.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I came to Theater Four, it was like starting in
England again,'' Humphries recalled. ``I got a marvelous review
from Rex Reed, but it came out after the show closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dame Edna, of course, blames the auditorium and the audience.
``It was off off off off off Broadway,'' she said, adding, ``There
was a time when I was a bit too complex for America. I was
vulnerable in private before Barbra Streisand was vulnerable in
private.'' Today, however, Dame Edna feels audiences are ready for
her. ``I'm ready to expose myself to the majority,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While Dame Edna insists she is not Barry Humphries, Humphries is
more forthcoming. ``I think of it as a game and I think of it as
fun,'' he said of his creation's independence. ``Dame Edna insists
on being Dame Edna and regards crass assertions that she's a
cross-dressing weirdo from Australia as scurrilous and
actionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Edna does acknowledge knowing Humphries. ``You know a person
inside out,'' she said that day at Sardi's. When, as a Melbourne
housewife, she met him, Dame Edna remembered, ``He was dressed up
as a woman, which is a bit unsavory.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, she considers Humphries a bit of a hanger on. When she
heard, for example, that six episodes of ``Dame Edna's Neighborhood
Watch,'' a British game show for which she served as host in 1992
on the BBC, are now available on videotape in America, she
criticized him as an opportunist ever eager to make money off her
talents. Still, she said, ``If it hadn't been for him, I wouldn't
be where I am today.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he is gay-friendly and a bit of a dandy, Humphries is
not a drag queen. He thinks of himself as a character actor and
Edna as a role. He is married to Lizzie Spender, daughter of the
British poet Sir Stephen Spender, and has two sons and two
daughters, some of whom have come to New York to be with him during
the run of ``Dame Edna: The Royal Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who don't believe a straight man could do such a
convincing job of playing a woman, Humphries says: ``Acting is
dressing up. Do they think Laurence Olivier was Danish because he
played Hamlet?'' Besides, he maintains that Dame Edna is not a drag
act: ``If Edna were doing a drag act, she'd have to dress up as a
man, wouldn't she? And she's never sung `Over the Rainbow' in her
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from an extended run of the show in San Francisco _ ``the
Proclivity City,'' Dame Edna called it _ Humphries usually saunters
over to the Booth about an hour before curtain time. ``I check the
gladioli when I get to the theater,'' he said. These flowers, one
of his signatures, will eventually be thrown at the audience, an
idea he says he borrowed from the the soprano Joan Sutherland
decades ago and has never abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stagehands say, `The gladdies are looking good tonight,'''
an amused Humphries said. Then he proceeds to his dressing room to
do his own makeup. ``I like a moment when I can think quietly'' he
said. ``I'm moving from one life to another. As soon as the glasses
go on, I cease to be myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Dame Edna, he noted, owns about a hundred pairs of glasses that
Elton John would have envied in his prime. ``Edna has to dazzle,''
Humphries said. ``She's a bird of paradise to some extent, or a
vulture.''
</P>
<P>
   Onstage as the old bird, Humphries converses with the audience,
making up much of it as he goes along. ``As Barry, he's not funny
offstage,'' said Leonard Soloway, a producer of the show. ``It's as
if he turns a key in his brain and comes up with this stuff. The
other night he said, `I think I'm going to have a heart attack.
Maybe I should call this `The Angina Monologues.' He doesn't write
any of it down. He just does it.''
</P>
<P>
   Humphries says that some people have warned him about trying to
bring his particular brand of humor to America: ```You're going to
America,' they say. `Is that wise? They have no sense of humor, no
sense of irony.' It's usually a statement made by British comics
who have had terrible receptions here. They are constantly
underestimating the quick-wittedness of American audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he said, the funniest television _ save for ``Absolutely
Fabulous'' and ``Fawlty Towers'' _ is made in America. He has a
fondness for ``Friends'' and ``The Larry Sanders Show.''
</P>
<P>
   His own American television specials, while admired by
Edna-philes, never captured the audiences his British specials and
series did. ``The American television people were so nervous about
what Edna was going to say, it cramped my style,'' Humphries said.
Not surprisingly, he rails against the concept of political
correctness. ``It's fascism posing as liberalism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges, though, that his show is a bit strange for
American audiences: ``It's a character actor dressed up as an
Australian housewife who thinks she's a mixture of Barbra Streisand
and Jocelyn Wildenstein, with a little bit of Susan Sontag and
Martha Stewart thrown in. But I feel there's an audience for what I
do. People all over the world want to be entertained.''
</P>
<P>
   Dame Edna seems to have her Broadway debut in perspective. ``Not
everyone gets the point of me,'' she acknowledged, ``or I would
have to be playing Madison Square Garden.''

JAPAN GIVES AMERICAN-LED GROUP RIGHT TO ACQUIRE BIG BANK 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In a landmark decision that gives foreigners the
go-ahead signal to take control of a Japanese bank, the government
on Tuesday granted an American-led investor group the exclusive
right to acquire the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, a former
financial giant hobbled by bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Reconstruction Commission, which regulates
Japanese banks, said that the group led by Ripplewood Holdings LLC,
a private investment firm in New York, had begun negotiations to
buy Long-Term Credit. Both sides said they expected to reach a
formal agreement by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   A Ripplewood deal for the bank had been expected since last
week, when word began to circulate in Tokyo that the American
company was close to receiving Japan's approval to proceed. If the
deal is completed, Long-Term Credit would be the first Japanese
bank to be controlled by foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   The bank once was one of Japan's largest and most prestigious,
and it helped to finance much of the country's rapid recovery and
economic resurgence after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the government took control of the bank because of
enormous losses on loans that were not being repaid.
</P>
<P>
   Like many banks in Japan, Long-Term Credit made extensive
speculative loans in the 1980s that contributed to Japan's bubble
economy. Much of that speculation was in the real estate market,
which collapsed in the early 1990s, leading developers and
borrowers to default.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Financial Reconstruction Commission, Hakuo
Yanagisawa, said at a news conference on Tuesday that the
Ripplewood group had been chosen from a wide field of prospective
buyers because it best fit the government's criteria for
restructuring the financial industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Ripplewood group includes Deutsche Bank, ABN Amro of the
Netherlands, the Bank of Nova Scotia, Mellon Bank, the GE Capital
unit of the General Electric Co., Citigroup and Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
   While some analysts have speculated that Ripplewood's real
intention in acquiring Long-Term is to liquidate its assets,
Timothy C. Collins, the firm's chief executive, said here Tuesday
that he was committed to returning the bank to its past prominence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We first started looking at the Japanese economy two years
ago,'' Collins said, ``and we concluded that while there were some
serious structural problems, it was still the second-largest
economy in the world, and that it would emerge from this situation
more powerful than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a memorandum of understanding signed Tuesday, the
international consortium will buy the common stock of Long-Term
Capital from the Deposit Insurance Corp., a government agency, for
1 billion yen, or about $9.4 million at current rates, and then
invest an amount equivalent to $1.13 billion in the newly created
bank.
</P>
<P>
   The bank will request a little more than $2.25 billion in public
funds from the Japanese government, the banking commission said,
adding that the government plans to pump a further $9.4 billion in
public funds into Long-Term Capital to cover the bank's leftover
bad-loan losses.
</P>
<P>
   The bank will be headed by Masamoto Yashiro, who is known for an
aggressive management style and for his success in running Citibank
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Yashiro said Tuesday that the new bank's viability would be
determined by how it provides Long-Term Credit's customers with
services and products they are now seeking from other international
banks.

 Mindy Aloff is the dance critic for The New Republic.  
 By MINDY ALOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the last couple of seasons, the musical theater,
both in New York (``Fosse,'' ``Footloose'') and in London
(``Oklahoma!,'' ``Swan Lake'') seems to have rediscovered dancing _
not as an ornament or a practical interlude to entertain the
audience while the actors or singers change costume, but as a
resource in itself that can help advance the themes or story of a
show, or, in the cases of ``Fosse'' and ``Swan Lake,'' embody them
fully.
</P>
<P>
   How long this interest will last is anyone's guess. Still, for
Broadway habitues who remember the heydays of Jerome Robbins, Bob
Fosse, Michael Bennett and Tommy Tune, or even of George
Balanchine, Agnes de Mille, Helen Tamiris and Hanya Holm, all of
whom animated Broadway musicals to audiences' delight, the current
generation's attempt to reinvent the wheels within wheels that once
made Broadway choreography a distinctive and useful contribution to
the lyric stage is a touching effort. And, given the sea change in
American culture over the last two decades, a daunting one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The idea that innovation has meaning only in reference to a
tradition about which the innovators are thoroughly informed is a
classical perspective on art that has given rebirth to, for
example, Richard Wagner through Richard Rodgers and Giacomo Puccini
through Andrew Lloyd Webber. A love of the past, sensitively built
into an engagement with the present, can actually translate into
wide popular appeal, i.e., into box-office receipts, by speaking to
frames of reference that audiences already know, thereby drawing
them into new material.
</P>
<P>
   This love is different from pure imitation, which rarely
survives, and from appropriation, which tends to brutalize its
sources, and also to have a short shelf life. All styles of dancing
that have any staying power build on the past in a deeper, organic
way and turn their practitioners into scholars and historians by
default. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A fascination with dance history and its attendant elements of
retrospection and perfectionism _ that anxiety to get all the
details reasoned out and clearly realized, because the gods one
internalizes as well as the ticket buyers one hopes to attract will
be watching _ is of some critical importance to at least three
forthcoming Broadway shows that feature dance.
</P>
<P>
   The shows, in various phases of production, are ``Contact''
(opening on Thursday at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater), ``Saturday
Night Fever'' (Oct. 21, at the Minskoff Theater) and ``Swing''
(Dec. 9, at the St. James Theater). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In its origins and working process, ``Contact'' _ essentially a
theater ballet in three parts, with direction and choreography by
Susan Stroman and a (largely tacit) book by John Weidman _ may be
the least dependent on historical particulars. In fact, its
underlying mechanism is not dance but rather a wordplay on the term
``swing'': swing dance and music, swingers in a sexual sense, the
act of swinging (as in the painting ``The Swing,'' by Jean-Honore
Fragonard, which provides the point of departure for the setting
and the choreographic conceits of the first section). Still,
dancing is the central language.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stroman's resume includes premieres for the New York City
Ballet and the Martha Graham Dance Company, as well as choreography
for the lamentably short-lived Kander and Ebb musical ``Steel
Pier,'' for the recent London revival of ``Oklahoma!'' (which she
reconceived with Trevor Nunn) and for the Tony Award-winning
``Crazy for You'' and ``Show Boat.'' So she appreciates both the
niceties of the concert stage and the theatrical necessities of
commercial enterprises. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I come from the theater, all of my choreography comes
from plot and characters,'' Ms. Stroman said in a recent interview.
``We now refer to `Contact''' _ the title of both the show as a
whole and of the third part on its own _ ``as a dance play. That
is, we took a company of dancers who act and actors who dance and
created a piece for them that has dance all the way through.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was the ``Contact'' within ``Contact'' _ the section
most resembling a play with dancing, rather than a dance with
dialogue _ that Ms. Stroman and Weidman conceived first and that
Lincoln Center offered to produce as a self-contained entity at the
Newhouse, unless the collaborators had other ideas up their
sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   Although they certainly did, and created ``Swinging'' and ``Did
You Move?'' as companion pieces, the third section remains for them
quite special, both the seed and the heart of the evening. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The story of a disillusioned man who saves his own life through
the discovery of the joys of dancing _ in his case, of contemporary
swing dancing _ ``Contact'' incorporates Ms. Stroman's memory of
having visited a late-night dance club in New York's meat-market
district and observing there ``a girl alone in a yellow dress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew somebody was going to dance with this girl,'' Ms.
Stroman said, ``and that she was going to change someone's life.''
The Girl in a Yellow Dress (Deborah Yates) and the guy whose life
gets changed, here an advertising executive, are fantasized by Ms.
Stroman and Weidman into nightly reality. The swing dancing they
learn to do together is also the product of an idea, in Ms.
Stroman's words, ``of people connecting and touching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The real story of `Contact' is about someone who takes a
chance in unfamiliar territory,'' she said. ``Boyd Gaines'' _ the
ad exec _ ``as an actor who had to learn to dance for this show, is
also taking a chance. When he gets a panicked look in his eye as he
holds out his hand to the girl, it's not far from the truth.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weidman, who describes himself as ``dance-ignorant, an escapee
from Miss Komar's dance class in 1955 who has not looked back,''
emphasized that in all three parts of ``Contact'' (the show), he
and Ms. Stroman devised the story before undertaking the
choreography, although sometimes the rehearsals with the dancers
brought forward a plot element no one had thought of on paper.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in a stunningly wicked role-reversal finale for
``Swinging,'' a quartet for three dancers and a garden swing set in
pre-Revolutionary France, Weidman ``wrote a two-page description of
the events that would occur.'' Still, he said, the story felt
incomplete: ``The role reversal at the end, which I see as the
French Revolution, came out of the rehearsal process.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the spectrum _ in terms of its mission,
the length of its development (eight years), and its challenge to
overcome an ``original version'' _ is ``Saturday Night Fever,''
which has sought to translate to the stage the dramatic events,
characters, music and dance imagery of the 1977 film that managed
to catapult its composers (Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb, aka the
Bee Gees), its star (John Travolta) and its dance focus (the
Hustle, a complicated relative of the mambo) into the Valhalla of
collective popular memory. (A new print of the film is scheduled
for release soon.)
</P>
<P>
   The show, a project dear to its conceiving producer, Robert
Stigwood, who also produced the film, has already been playing in
London for more than a year to capacity audiences, many of them
children, according to the director-choreographer Arlene Phillips,
whose work is familiar to New Yorkers from ``Starlight Express''
and ``Lord of the Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The dancing in this show goes much further than it does in the
film,'' Ms. Phillips said. ``In the film, they do more line dances
than actual Hustles. Also, in the film, the competition dancers who
surround the main character, Tony Manero, aren't trained dancers;
they're club dancers. In the 1990s, people know a lot more about
dance: their experiences of doing it and seeing it are much broader
than they were 20 years ago. We've taken what, in the film, was the
most important thread _ the dancing _ and have made big dance
numbers that reach a peak. In the show, we use the dance to
celebrate what dancing did for people of that time. It made every
person in the world feel that if he could walk or move, he could
dance. Robert Stigwood wanted to capture that feeling again.''
</P>
<P>
   (Phil Edwards, who is in charge of the dance and vocal
arrangements, notes that the Gibb brothers have written two new
songs for the show, and that the beloved songs from the film have
been ``subtly'' altered, through the addition of extra drum beats
and reworked keyboard patterns, to give the sound a ``subliminal
contemporary flavor.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As in all the shows, the dancing in ``Fever,'' which will have
an American cast in New York, is meant to function as a metaphor of
how a life can be beneficially transformed through the study and
practice of disciplined movement to music. And as in ``Contact,''
the challenge is to mix trained dancers, who can really do the
material justice, with actors who, though they are dance novices,
may be center stage in the stories.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Phillips says her responsibilities as a director and as a
choreographer ``fight all the time.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As a director,'' she said, ``you want to bring out the dark
side of the story, the depth, the harsh truth. As a choreographer,
you're celebrating the magic and the dance. Sometimes, I've got to
pull down the dance, even though the dancers are doing a very
exciting move in a particular number, because James Carpinello, who
plays Tony, has a dance background but not a life in dance, and, as
he's on stage so much of the time, he physically couldn't go that
far in an evening.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With ``Swing,'' on the other hand, it seems as if nothing is
being spared to showcase bravura dancing, which will be crucial to
that show, as it doesn't have a proper book. Performing in it will
be some of the most heralded contemporary exponents of various
facets of swing dancing, from the Lindy Hop to hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's more than a revue,'' said Lynne Taylor-Corbett, the
director and overall choreographer. ``There's no Talmudic
dissertation or sociological material, but there is a message about
swing dancing, which is that you can't do it alone. What we know
about swing dance, which was especially popular between the 1920s
and the 1940s and is enjoying a comeback now, is that it never went
away. It underlies rock-and-roll, and it keeps morphing. No one
wrote something out and said, `Let's put this up,' but in the
course of developing the show, we began to group the dances and
musical numbers. Some of the groupings are shorter anecdotes, and
some are in a longer form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also knew that what would make the show really exciting was
to be as inclusive of as many styles of swing as I could find, and
to find as many championship couples to do it as I could. We have
Lindy Hopping, jive, Western, hip-hop. I'm putting them together as
a kind of privileged curator and theatricalizing the arcs of these
different dances.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In acting as a curator, Ms. Taylor-Corbett _ a veteran
choreographer of ballet and modern dance as well as of Broadway's
``Titanic'' and Hollywood's ``Footloose'' _ is working with a team
of associates and experts to construct the dances in the studio;
and she insists on giving them credit.
</P>
<P>
   Frankie Manning, considered the inventor of the Lindy's aerobic
airsteps, contributed to them here, for instance. Rod McCune, the
dance captain, helped devise the adagio lifts, for which his
background as a cheerleader _ where he learned about thrown lifts _
came in rather handy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scott Fowler, the son and grandson of dancers, served as Ms.
Taylor-Corbett's associate choreographer. His job, he explained in
a recent interview, was ``to show where a step or a number can go,
and to be there as another brain.'' Fowler began to study tap, at
the age of 4, with his uncle (who danced for years with Fowler's
father in a tap act called the Fowler Brothers); in choreographing
one of the show's tap numbers _ Ms. Taylor-Corbett doesn't tap _ he
thought about his father and his uncle, using their up-on-the-toes
style of tapping.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his regard for Ryan Francois' and Jenny Thomas'
coaching of the company in refinements of the Lindy, Fowler said:
``As Broadway dancers, we go from show to show; we rarely are able
to perfect a specific act. Here, we even do ballet warm-up class. I
haven't done that since `Jerome Robbins' Broadway,''' in 1989. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The musical director Jonathan Smith, a former student of the
jazz pianist Ellis Marsalis, explained that the spirit of
perfectionism and authenticity extends to the songs (sung by Ann
Hampton Calloway, making her Broadway debut) and instrumental
numbers. The band, the Gotham City Gates, will be center stage.
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate the connoisseurship that runs through ``Swing,''
consider that one musical number, ``Swing It, Brother, Swing,'' by
Raymond Bishop-Williams, was a trouve of a band member, Casey
MacGill, who heard it on a 1937 recording of Billie Holiday singing
it during an air check, and whose arrangement is based on her
distinctive performance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In itself, connoisseurship _ that is, the levels of remembrance
built into theatrical imagery _ is not a predictor of commercial
success. Indeed, lacking a context of high originality and
friendliness toward the audience, it can prove a drawback. Still,
without it, musical theater is lost as a creative enterprise: its
practitioners grow cynical, manipulative and cold, and that is what
they teach their audiences to become, too.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, for the teaching to take root, a student must be
complicit, either through laziness or fear of independent thinking
or of making some kind of mistake. Great audiences _ that is, those
who know what they feel and think _ may be blind on occasion, or
mix up details, yet they are never mistaken in what matters most:
they want transporting art, and sometimes they get it.

A PHOTOGRAPHER ON THE BLURRED, CHAOTIC EDGE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Daido Moriyama's vision resides in the heart of darkness,
literally and figuratively. The world he records is black, stunned
rather than illuminated by light, threatening, chaotic,
incomprehensible, compulsively erotic, obsessed, eccentric, fixated
on consumption, devastated by accidents, always off kilter,
sometimes ruined, sometimes empty _ a world unaware of its own
instability, a world in need of Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   His photographic technique, all blur and scratches, bleach and
dust, joins with his subject matter to conjure documents on the
verge of disintegration. At times Moriyama tinkers with the limits
of perception, which he makes look hopelessly narrow, and with the
limits of photography, which he makes seem very limited indeed.
</P>
<P>
   This is a tough vision, even a fierce one, individual, authentic
and pursued to the far reaches of its own premises, and it can be
seen all over New York right now. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1938, Moriyama is one of Japan's most respected and
influential contemporary photographers, but little known in
America, though his work has appeared in group shows here, even in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The first retrospective exhibition of Moriyama's photographs
anywhere in the world (the Japanese not caring much for
retrospectives of living photographers) is divided between ``Daido
Moriyama: Stray Dog'' at the Japan Society Gallery in Manhattan,
which includes 130 photographs from several of his major series,
and ``Daido Moriyama: Hunter,'' 40 photographs from a 1972 series,
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (both through Jan. 2).
</P>
<P>
   These joint shows were organized by the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art (where it had its premiere last May) and the Japan
Society Gallery. Sandra S. Phillips, the curator of photography at
the San Francisco Modern, is the curator; an informative catalog
accompanies the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Laurence Miller Gallery, in Manhattan, has 32
prints by Moriyama, some not in either of the other exhibitions,
and the Roth Horowitz Gallery, has an exhibition of photographs by
Shomei Tomatsu, a major photographer whose work had a significant
impact on Moriyama's.
</P>
<P>
   Roth Horowitz is also showing pictures from Provoke, a
short-lived, extremely daring Japanese photography magazine of the
late 1960s, as well as books by Provoke's contributors, including
five by Moriyama, who almost always worked with books in mind.
</P>
<P>
   A late 1960s series of nudes by Moriyama, evidently sex workers,
with an occasional male leg or two in the picture, are at once
flatly explicit and softly romantic, the bodies thrown so far out
of focus that little besides the dark circles of the nipples and
the dark patch of pubic hair confirm the subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, when he and others had already tossed over the
tradition of polished photographic techniques, Moriyama pushed the
medium into illegible territories, as if to say that photography
could not record what really mattered. In a book called Farewell
Photography, not only are the photographs out of focus, scratched
up and marred by dirt and light flares, but some of the subjects
are also indecipherable, and some are apparently about nothing,
emptiness, the void.
</P>
<P>
   Later he had a change of heart; after giving up photography for
a couple of years, he returned to it in 1982 with colder but also
clearer images, what might be called a more perfectly focused
nihilism.
</P>
<P>
   The eponymous stray dog appears in one picture as a shaggy
beast, menacing, wary, a street wanderer looming enormous in the
frame. At the Japan Society, an installation of 3,400 Polaroid
images Moriyama took of his living and working space in 1997 (the
only color in any of the shows) centers on this image.
</P>
<P>
   The photographer recently told Photo Metro magazine that when he
photographs, he walks down the main thoroughfare, diving into and
out of alleys, like a stray dog.
</P>
<P>
   He is indeed an urban wanderer, an outsider, feral in his ways,
often shooting from the hip, sometimes on the run, or from the
shadows, through fences, from the windows of a moving car _ an
image thief, snapping away on impulse and intuition in response to
the crazy rhythms of the modern life.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes to make images of images, particularly movie
posters advertising sex and violence. It is not always clear
whether a photograph is of a picture or of the thing itself; by the
1960s the two were already nearly interchangeable.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes people pose for his camera, like a suburban couple
clutching a box of detergent. More often he steals the picture.
What he catches in his nearly random net is the peripheral vision
of a city dweller, the bleary bits and fragments, the chance events
and partly registered perceptions of our rapid daily rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chaotic everyday existence,'' he once said, ``is what I think
Japan is all about.'' When he has gathered sufficient chaos, he
edits it into a detonating order all his own: pulsing,
nonnarrative, ambiguous and textless pairs and sequences in
magazines and books.
</P>
<P>
   Attracted to outsiders and outlaws, Moriyama has photographed
more than once where he is not welcome. A young woman in one
picture races away frantically down a trash-filled alley. At a
recent lecture, Moriyama said she was running because she had got
in trouble with the yakuza (Japanese gangsters), and that he was
beaten up and forced to rip his film out of his camera after he
took the picture.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As this was not his first such encounter, Moriyama had devised a
way to keep his film intact while pulling a fresh roll out of the
camera. The scent of something ominous that filters into his
photographs begins to feel like a whiff of realism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will go and take photographs,'' he told an interviewer, ``as
long as I still am capable of running away when someone tries to
punch me. I can tumble.'' Moriyama is not the first who could make
you think that a slight touch of craziness might be a valuable
trait for those who want to be photographers; at any rate, he is
obviously devoted to his profession and his subject.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog, with essays by Ms. Phillips and Alexandra Munroe,
Director of the Japan Society Gallery, fills in some background
information on the Zeitgeist that put this work in motion and the
context that surrounded it. There was, of course, the inescapable
fact of two atom bombs dropped on Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Tomatsu, only eight years older than Moriyama, documented the
direct effects of the bomb on survivors, but generations are so
brief today (and Japan underwent such rapid and overwhelming
changes) that someone eight years younger saw another society,
shaped first by catastrophe but then reshaped by subsequent events.
</P>
<P>
   Americans were a major presence in Japan and American popular
culture a major import. Moriyama was fascinated by the driving
energy, the sex, modernization and liberal Western customs that
were infiltrating Japan and forming new hybrids with the
traditional culture.
</P>
<P>
   Many Japanese were furiously resentful of the invading,
occupying power, Moriyama apparently less so. Demonstrations
against the treaty that allowed American military forces in Japan
turned particularly violent in 1960. Strikes and student protests
soon became more violent too, the Vietnam war making a profound
contribution to the depth of the dissent.
</P>
<P>
   As in other places, the 1960s were a time of public turmoil,
experiment and drugs, complicated in Japan by nuclear destruction,
the miraculous economic rebirth of the country, and the bewildering
atmosphere of transition between an old society and a new and
foreign one.
</P>
<P>
   Photographers, including Moriyama, needed a new way to respond
to this wave of ferment and change that was engulfing their
country. At Roth Horowitz, the display of Provoke magazine and
books makes clear that he was not reacting alone but was part of a
photographic movement that sprang up in Japan, with obvious
affinities to movements in Japanese literature and film, in
reaction to what amounted to an existential crisis as the frenetic
modern world transformed the country.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries had been experiencing related changes and
upheavals. Globalization was already on its way, and artistic ideas
traveled between continents on the backs of publications. Moriyama
was shocked and influenced by William Klein's book of photographs
of New York, published in Japan in 1957, with its raw vitality and
confrontation, grotesqueries of the street and fierce disregard for
technique. He took what he could use and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Later a friend showed him a Warhol catalog that shocked him
again with its emphasis on death and consumerism. Moriyama did a
series of photographs of accidents, some of them details of a
police safety poster. He also took pictures of canned goods on
grocery store shelves, even Campbell soup cans. Where Warhol's
repeated soup cans are clean, mechanically repetitive displays of
forced cheerfulness _ the alluring calculus of a consumer culture _
Moriyama's are morose masses of identical labels rushing toward a
numbing infinity of manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, the economic boom had submerged the idealism of
the 1960s in Japan as it had elsewhere, leaving frustration and
discouragement in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   An understanding of Japan's upheaval is probably crucial to an
understanding of this work, and the influences count, too. But in
the end, the artist is an individual with a mind and feelings and
talent that nothing external can wholly account for.
</P>
<P>
   Different photographers using the same photographic language in
the same places wrote different synopses of their times. Art
continues to move in mysterious ways. Let us now give thanks for
mysteries.

TURKISH PREMIER IS EMPTY-HANDED AFTER MEETING WITH CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a meeting between Turkish Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit and President Clinton, the administration announced
Tuesday that it would send its new special envoy to Cyprus into the
region to try and start talks between the two sides on the divided
island.
</P>
<P>
   The dispatch of Alfred Moses, a former U.S. ambassador to
Romania and now the envoy to Cyprus, appeared to be the most
concrete action to emerge from the White House encounter Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A specific aid package that had been planned by the United
States to help Turkey rebuild after its earthquake was watered down
so much that in the end Turkey decided not to accept what was
offered, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration hoped to capitalize on the improved relations
between rival Greece and Turkey since both had experienced recent
earthquakes and then sent assistance to each other.
</P>
<P>
   With the human help bridging diplomatic differences, the
administration wanted to use the new warmth to start a renewal of
talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
   After the White House meeting, senior administration officials
stressed that Ecevit had not agreed with the administration's
request _ backed by the European Union _ for United
Nations-sponsored negotiations between the two sides on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denkash has steadfastly refused to
participate in talks.
</P>
<P>
   Using careful language, an administration official said that the
Turkish leader ``supported the idea of sending Al Moses to the
region to explore ways of moving toward a negotiated settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. delegate to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, who
was also a special envoy to Cyprus, made similar but unsuccessful
trips last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cyprus has been divided since Turkish troops invaded in 1974 in
response to a Greek-inspired coup in Nicosia. A breakaway
Turkish-Cypriot state in the north is recognized by Turkey only,
which keeps about 30,000 troops there.
</P>
<P>
   The administration did not appear to see a breakthrough on
Cyprus soon. An administration official said that ``this was a very
opportune moment,'' but added that ``we're realistic people.''
</P>
<P>
   On the question of aid for reconstruction, Turkish officials had
said they hoped the United States cold provide guarantees for about
$5 billion in loans.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration, after talking with Congress, offered
backing for about $1 billion in loans. In recent days, Turkish
officials have expressed their disappointment and decided not to
push for the aid, fearing that new loans might tax the country's
credit ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, an administration official said the earthquake damage
was less dramatic than first thought, and that with help from the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the guarantees from
Washington were not needed.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to come through with guarantees for Turkey _ in
contrast to the $750 million in grants and credits from the
European Union _ was the result of several factors, said Alan
Makovsky, an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fault the administration not for lack of good will but for
lack of getting their act together in time'' for the prime
minister's visit, Makovsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's lack of leadership with the Congress and the parsimonious
approach that Congress has taken to foreign affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Ecevit, a senior left-of-center politician, became prime
minister earlier this year, Turkey has improved its human rights
record.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have praised the government for
this but have suggested there is room for further improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Akin Birdal, former president of the Human Rights Association,
was released from prison Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this month one of Turkey's best-known prisoners, the
pro-Kurdish sociologist Ismail Besikci, was released from prison.
He was warned that he would be sent back to prison if he again
violates laws against publishing subversive opinions.

THE DIFFERENT PATHS OF GIANTS, CROSSING AT LAST  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Susan Reiter's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about the
dancer-choreographer Robert La Fosse.  
 By SUSAN REITER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a dance student at the Juilliard School in the
1960s, Carla Maxwell studied with both Jose Limon and Antony Tudor,
two of the century's seminal choreographers. Aside from their
Juilliard connection, the two _ the first a pillar of midcentury
American modern dance, the other a master of subtle,
psychologically astute classical ballets _ were not likely to find
their paths crossing.
</P>
<P>
   But they will now. Works by these choreographers will share a
program when the Limon Dance Company, of which Ms. Maxwell is the
artistic director, comes to the Joyce Theater starting Tuesday for
a two-week season. The troupe will perform Tudor's 1937 masterwork
``Dark Elegies'' alongside Limon's ``There Is a Time,'' from 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maxwell calls the troupe's acquisition of ``Dark Elegies'' a
dream come true. ``When I first took over the company in 1978, we
thought it would be incredible to have a Tudor work,'' she said.
``But I don't think we had the company then. We were in transition.
Our present company is more suited to doing his work; there's a
different training, a different attitude. We're in a more stable
situation, and more able to hold onto the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Repertory choices have been a paramount concern during Ms.
Maxwell's tenure as director. Beyond maintaining the acclaimed
dances by Limon (who died in 1972) and his mentor Doris Humphrey
that had always been the company's raison d'etre, she has sought
out works, both old and new, to complement these standards and
challenge the company's dancers and audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The Joyce programs reflect this delicate balance between past
and present. In addition to ``Dark Elegies,'' the two major
additions to the repertory, both made possible by the company's
American Choreographers' Initiative, are Doug Varone's new ``The
Plain Sense of Things'' and a reconstruction of ``Champion,'' a
1948 piece by Sophie Maslow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Jose passed away, our mission has been to present
existing masterworks, dances by contemporary masters and new
choreography by the younger generation,'' Ms. Maxwell said recently
at the company's bustling studios and offices on lower Broadway. As
she talked, she removed the long, full practice skirt she had been
wearing for a rehearsal of Limon's ``Moor's Pavane''; she continues
to be a leading dancer with the company, which she joined in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Deftly switching into her artistic-director mode, she continued,
``We thought it would be exciting to explore works outside of our
own legacy, to see what works by other choreographers of that time
we could include.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maslow's ``Champion,'' based on a Ring Lardner short story
about a prizefighter and not seen since the early 1950s, became the
first such work the company acquired through the initiative. Donald
McKayle, who, in addition to his own choreographic and teaching
activities, has been the Limon troupe's artistic mentor and
resident choreographer since 1996, provided the crucial link. As an
18-year-old dancer, he performed in the original cast of
``Champion,'' and he suggested the piece to Ms. Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt it would be appropriate for our dancers because it was
dramatic (and that's our meat and potatoes) and had some humor in
it,'' Ms. Maxwell said. ``He felt we had the dancers who could make
it shine. I think he made a very astute choice; the range and
weight of the work suit our company.''
</P>
<P>
   No film or notation of ``Champion'' exists; there are only a few
photos and some contemporary reviews to draw on. The reconstruction
depended on the memories of Ms. Maslow and McKayle, working from
Samuel Matlowsky's original score, which has been adapted by David
LaMarche and will be performed live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had things I remembered in a rather broad way, and Donald
McKayle was a great help,'' Ms. Maslow said in a telephone
interview. An early member of Martha Graham's company who went on
to choreograph and perform with the Dudley-Maslow-Bales Trio (under
whose auspices ``Champion'' had its premiere), she is now in her
80s but vividly recalls the making of the dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was quite excited by the Lardner story,'' Ms. Maslow said.
``The people in it are not defined very clearly, except for the
Champion, who goes through life beating up everyone he has contact
with. ``I went to Stillman's Gym on Eighth Avenue to see how the
boxers trained,'' she recalled, explaining the source for the
dance's explosive second ``round,'' in which the boxers work out
while the women look on admiringly. She noted with surprise that in
present-day classes, ``most of the people doing it are women.''
</P>
<P>
   Some things may have changed since 1948, but the theme of
``Champion'' should still ring true: the less-than-admirable
private life of someone who is publicly touted as a hero. ``It's
the Mike Tyson story,'' Ms. Maxwell said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The muted, somber ``Dark Elegies'' draws on a completely
different side of the dancers. ``It is a great challenge because of
its formalism,'' Ms. Maxwell said. Sally Brayley Bliss, the
executor and trustee of the Antony Tudor Ballet Trust, encouraged
the company to add this work to its repertory, making it the first
modern-dance troupe to perform a Tudor ballet.
</P>
<P>
   She has approved their slightly different version, in which the
women are not on point, there is no set and the costumes are
adapted from the original designs. Ballet companies like American
Ballet Theater have had the score, Mahler's ``Kindertotenlieder,''
performed live by an onstage baritone with orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The Limon production, staged by Donald Mahler, uses a 1950s
recording featuring the contralto Kathleen Ferrier.
</P>
<P>
   While this season, which also includes a new 50th-anniversary
production of Limon's ``Moor's Pavane,'' pays considerable homage
to the past, the Varone premiere looks toward the future. Set to
Philip Glass's Saxophone Quartet and inspired by the paintings of
Edward Hopper, it reunites Varone with the first professional
company in which he danced.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels very strong ties to the Limon legacy, and it has
inspired his own work,'' Ms. Maxwell said. So even this newest
addition to the repertory has links to tradition, just as the older
works will help push the company and its dancers in new directions.

CHASE AGREES TO ACQUIRE HAMBRECHT &AMP; QUIST 
</HEADLINE>

(mk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN and PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan Corp. agreed Tuesday to buy San Francisco-based
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist for $1.35 billion, giving one of America's
dominant traditional banks an entree into the world of Internet
start-ups and bringing it a step closer to becoming a full-service
financial concern.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed cash deal pairs two financial companies _ Chase,
the heavyweight banker for large corporations, and Hambrecht, a
boutique catering to Silicon Valley entrepreneurs _ that had begun
to look like lonely singles at a swinging square dance. Chase's
major competitors have all bought or merged with investment banking
firms. Hambrecht is the last of its class of finance firms that
catered to technology companies to find a larger and
deeper-pocketed partner.
</P>
<P>
   But the marriage, if it's consummated, falls far short of the
megamerger that Chase executives, and many on Wall Street, have
talked about for more than a year. The New York-based bank, the
third-largest in the United States, has made no secret of its
desire to complete a ``transformative'' deal that would create the
world's most potent competitor in everything from bank loans to
initial offerings of stock. Chase officials were quick to point out
that Tuesday's purchase did not fulfill those ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to say what this deal is and what it isn't,''
said Marc Shapiro, a Chase vice chairman. ``What it is is an
investment in the new economy. But as a total solution to the
global platform we are looking for _ we have not crossed that
bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hambrecht deal seemed to some analysts to be tacit admission
that Chase's recent overtures to Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter and Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., the three biggest Wall Street
firms, had been unrequited, at least for now. But many said that
they expected the consolidation in the financial industry to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could we wake up one morning and find that Chase has merged
with Merrill? I don't think this changes that possibility,'' said
David Berry, a bank industry expert at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods.
``But for some reason, there's been no big deal for Chase so far.
And at some point you have to get on with life. This makes sense
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   One possibility, bank analysts said, is that Chase's pursuit of
Hambrecht signals its willingness to build a stock-underwriting
franchise brick-by-brick, rather than shelling out at least $30
billion to buy one of the top three Wall Street firms. That
suggests that Chase could try to buy a midsize underwriter like
Lehman Brothers or Paine Webber next.
</P>
<P>
   Though it leads the pack in the traditional lending business,
Chase had been slow to seize on the opportunity to expand into
stock underwriting. Competitors including Citigroup, Bank of
America and BankBoston have been quicker to snap up stock
underwriters when Depression-era laws that separated banks and
brokerages began being eased several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Hambrecht match also underscores the increasing importance
to the financial world of what analysts call the ``new economy'' _
high-tech and Internet companies that, at least in their early
years, are too small or lose too much money to do business with the
likes of Chase. Such start-up companies have often traditionally
relied on specialist firms like Hambrecht for financial guidance
because they were ignored by large banks and most Wall Street
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht's roots in the technology banking business run deep.
Daniel Case III, the chief executive, is the older brother of Steve
Case, chief executive of America Online. Hambrecht's reputation for
picking small but promising winners was made in 1980, when it
brought Apple Computer to market, and sealed in 1995, when it
backed Netscape's initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   For Hambrecht _ its name would change to Chase Securities West
if the deal is completed, as expected, by the end of the year _
Chase seems an ideal match after a long search. Case has talked to
numerous potential banking partners in the past, including the
German banks Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, as well as Merrill
Lynch, bankers said. Hambrecht's relative position in
high-technology investment banking had slipped behind Goldman,
Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other top Wall Street firms in the past
several years, in part because it did not have the range of
services as its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our little entrepreneurial part of the economy has become the
dominant part of the total economy in the 1990s,'' Case said in a
interview at his headquarters, a distinctive steel and glass
structure designed by Mies van der Rohe in San Francisco's
financial district. ``But our ability to serve our clients has been
narrowed by products and geography. Now we can grow with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale is also a financial coup for Hambrecht executives.
Chase will pay $50 a share to buy the firm, 22 percent more than
Monday's closing price of $41.0625. It will also set aside $200
million in stock to retain key bankers at the combined firm. Shares
of Hambrecht rose $7.625 Tuesday, to $48.6875, a record high; Chase
fell 31.25 cents, to $73.8125.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht could bargain from a position of relative strength
this year after its underwriting business slumped in 1997 and 1998.
It underwrote 17 initial public offerings valued at $972 million by
Securities Data Corp. so far this year. That's almost exactly what
it underwrote in 1996, though its share of the business is less
than 5 percent now, compared with 15 percent three years ago. It
stock has more than tripled in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   For Chase, the benefits of Hambrecht are less certain. Their
main clients are on almost opposite poles of the economy. Chase
serves large corporations that have sophisticated banking needs and
proven profit records. Hambrecht prides itself in spotting new
companies that would not qualify for a bank loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely a substantial difference in the size of
our clients,'' said James Lee, a Chase vice chairman who heads the
bank's investment banking arm and sat next to Case to explain the
merger to Hambrecht employees Tuesday. ``But the wonderful thing
about the tech business is that those companies grow fast.''
</P>
<P>
   For several years, Chase has been trying to extend its franchise
into investment banking, with mixed success. It is the No. 1
provider of syndicated loans, one of the top three underwriters of
junk bonds and a top 10 player in mergers and acquisitions. But it
has yet to make a mark in equities, the core investment banking
business.
</P>
<P>
   Chase is not the first New York bank to go West to take
advantage of the prolonged boom in technology stocks. Two years ago
Merrill Lynch came very close to buying Hambrecht amid a spree of
acquisitions of midsize investment banks. Morgan Stanley and
Goldman, Sachs have also beefed up their West Coast presence and
grabbed larger shares of the technology investment banking
business. In terms of technology company underwriting, Goldman,
Sachs and Morgan Stanley are now No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, by
a wide margin. So far this year, Hambrecht ranks No. 9.
</P>
<P>
   A buyout by Chase would end the independence of the last
remaining member of a quartet of smaller technology-focused
investment banks based outside of New York that was known on Wall
Street as the HARM group. The group included Hambrecht, Alex. Brown
&AMP; Sons, Robertson Stephens, and Montgomery Securities. Within the
last two years, each of those firms has been gobbled up by a large
commercial bank and each of the acquisitions has been followed by
defections of large numbers of investment bankers and other key
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable example of post-merger conflict came after
NationsBank Corp. bought San Francisco-based Montgomery Securities
for $1.2 billion. A year later, Thomas Weisel, who had run
Montgomery, left to start a new firm and recruited several of his
highest-ranking colleagues to join him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues are cultural _ the bureaucracy of a larger bank
being superimposed on an entrepreneurial shop,'' Weisel said
Tuesday, reflecting on his experience at NationsBank. Weisel said
he had respect for Chase executives, but predicted that they would
also face obstacles integrating Hambrecht.
</P>
<P>
   Case and Lee acknowledged that there was not a particularly
successful model for the sort of deal they are proposing, but they
said they expected a different result. ``This is about a lot more
than just a successful integration, but without a successful
integration nothing else matters,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chase is setting aside $200 million of stock to retain a
pool of Hambrecht's key employees. Case declined to say how many
people would share that money but he said it would be distributed
``broader and deeper'' than in other acquisitions in keeping with
the ``egalitarian'' culture of the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said those extended payouts would not be the key to making
the integration work. ``Money can't fix a bad cultural fit,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Case and the man he referred to as ``my new boss,'' Lee, are a
study in contrasts. Case, tall and slim at 41, still looks the part
of the wunderkind he once was. A Princeton University graduate, he
joined Hambrecht after completing a Rhodes scholarship at Oxford
University. He was named co-chief executive in 1992 and sole chief
executive two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 46, in French cuffs and suspenders, looks and talks more
the part of the powerful New York investment banker. Chase
executives said the Hambrecht deal increased his responsibilities
within the bank. Lee already oversees Chase's substantial
syndicated lending and merger and acquisitions businesses.

   NEW YORK _ While the discovery of the mosquito-borne West Nile
virus in the New York region has been fascinating for scientists
and public health experts, the concern among the general public is
more basic: People want to know if they are at risk for contracting
it, and they want to know where the virus is headed.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the exotic and inscrutable nature of West Nile
virus _ it had never been seen in the Western Hemisphere before it
was found in birds and humans in New York last Friday _ it is
impossible to completely evaluate its threat. Scientists and health
care experts have no idea how this disease even got to the United
States; theories range from smuggled birds to a single sick person
coming into the country.
</P>
<P>
   Given the mosquito spraying and cooling temperatures, it appears
that the chances of new transmissions to humans are relatively
small. But scientists confess that they are flummoxed by West Nile
and warn that too little is known about the virus and how it will
behave in its new home to give assurances. Its symptoms _ which
include fever and headache _ seem similar to those of St. Louis
encephalitis. Elderly people, young children and people with
weakened immune systems are most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hesitate to assign risk,'' said Andrew Spielman, a
professor of tropical public health at Harvard whose expertise is
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows, for instance, how long this region's birds,
which have never been exposed to the disease, can live with it.
That fact would determine, among other things, how many mosquitoes
can bite an infected bird, and how far the virus might travel.
``Obviously, this is a high-priority question,'' Spielman said. An
outbreak of West Nile is occurring simultaneously in Russia,
another area of the world where it had never been reported before.
</P>
<P>
   There have been well over 1,000 reports of birds dying suddenly
around the region since late July, and municipal health departments
have been receiving calls by the hundreds over the last week. Each
state in the region has been collecting bird samples and preparing
them for study at the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention; more than 50 birds from New York state have a
``presumptive'' diagnosis of West Nile, said Ward Stone, the state
wildlife pathologist.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the hundreds of birds already collected will undoubtedly
have died from other causes. But local governments have become
alarmed and stepped up spraying campaigns. ``That's an
extraordinary number of bird carcasses to see in Bergen County,''
said William Schuber, the Bergen County, N.J., Executive, about the
80 dead crows found in his region over the last few days. ``We do
have concern. Finding one dead crow is unusual. To find so many is
very unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's Department of Health has asked eight northern
counties to continue spraying insecticide until further notice.
Nassau and Suffolk counties sprayed one village each Tuesday night
and New York City officials said they would spray as needed.
Westchester County has halted spraying for the time being and
Connecticut began aerial spraying this week.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife experts became aware at the end of August that a
strange disease was infecting the bird population, because birds
were dying in large numbers. The experts ruled out St. Louis
encephalitis, because generally that illness does not kill the
birds that carry it. But in many ways, the clues stopped there. How
long can a bird live with West Nile before dying? Long enough to
fly far and wide and potentially spread the illness around via
mosquitoes that bite it? How long does it have to have been
infected for a mosquito that preys upon it to pick up the disease?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously one of the concerns is the widespread mortality, and
in more than one species,'' said Kathryn Converse, a
wildlife-disease specialist for the National Wildlife Health Center
in Madison, Wis., which is also evaluating dead birds from this
region. ``At this time, migrating birds are on the move, so we are
very concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Crows, which make up the majority of dead birds, tend to stick
close to home in the winter, though they can fly to other regions
if they need to. But they are not the only birds dying. Several
exotic species of birds at the Bronx Zoo have died in the last
month from West Nile virus. And common birds like sparrows,
starlings, robins and blue jays _ which tend to fly out of the
region in the fall and winter _ have been reported dying in unusual
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, in regions where West Nile is common, plenty of
birds live with it and never die, said Dr. Mahfouz Zaki, the
director of public health for Suffolk County and an expert on West
Nile virus. And because birds tend to carry the virus in their
blood longer than humans do, the time frame for mosquitoes to bite
them is long, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of mosquitoes. All of the region has
been aggressively spraying for them and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, for
one, has said that this should keep residents mostly out of harm's
way.
</P>
<P>
   But Spielman of Harvard's School of Public Health said that
outdoor spraying _ which has been carried out during the day or
early evening _ was most effective around midnight, when mosquitoes
feed. There is also, he said, an indoor type of mosquito that
carries West Nile that is not being killed by outdoor spraying,
although an indoor mosquito would also be unlikely to bite infected
birds. And experts have no idea of the effect of cold weather on
this illness.
</P>
<P>
   In a final twist, it is possible that West Nile was already part
of the American landscape, and has been discerned only because of
the current outbreak. ``The big question is whether this virus will
perpetuate itself in the U.S.,'' said Spielman. ``It's an extremely
complicated issue. We just have no idea what might be going on
here.''

AETNA SHARES FALL ON DOUBTS OVER HEALTH UNIT
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doubts that Aetna Inc. got its billion dollar's worth when it
bought the Prudential health care business last year sent Aetna
shares tumbling more than 12 percent in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   The plunge followed complaints by Wall Street analysts that
Aetna, the nation's largest health insurer, failed at a meeting
with investors Monday to explain how the deal would deliver the
immediate increases in profits that Aetna had projected.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna shares dropped to $60, a two-year low on the New York
Stock Exchange Tuesday, and rebounded to $61.75 at the close, a
drop of $5.1875, following a $3.0625 decline Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said, for example, that Aetna officials did not provide
current membership totals for Prudential, which lost more than 1
million members in 11 months from September 30, 1998, to the
completion of the deal early last month.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said the Prudential unit's losses were running at an
annual after-tax rate of $200 million, double the losses expected
by some analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It clearly hasn't been a good two days for them,'' said John
Rex, a health care analyst at Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Lori M. Price an analyst at CIBC World Markets, said, ``It
doesn't give you a warm comfortable feeling, when a company can't
even answer the question, what is your aggregate membership base?''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Aetna, Joyce Oberdorf, said the company was
``disappointed with the reaction of some investors,'' adding that
the transaction ``should provide a good return on investment.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said Aetna had rebuffed a request at the meeting
for return on investment projections.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oberdorf said Aetna was waiting to see how many Prudential
members remained loyal after higher monthly premiums take effect
next year. Many Prudential members will have to decide whether to
stay or switch to another health plan in the sign-up period now
under way. Prudential has posted price increases of 10 to 16
percent, and employers are likely to pass some of that increase to
employees, who may then change or drop their health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oberdorf said membership results would be included when the
company issued its next quarterly financial report.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Walter Goodman at Merrill Lynch said Aetna was also
unwilling to discuss its future projections for underlying medical
costs, which have been rising 5 percent to 6 percent for members of
health maintenance organizations and more sharply in other types of
health plans.
</P>
<P>
   William McKeever at Paine Webber said Aetna had ``potentially
again paid too much'' for Prudential, which he said Aetna had done
when it bought U.S. Healthcare for $8.8 billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna did spell out $221 million in paybacks to Aetna that the
seller, the Prudential Insurance Co. of America, had agreed to
during an 18-month transition. The payments include $166 million in
fees for managing benefits for self-insured companies and $55
million if the Prudential profit margins do not improve. Those
payments could reduce the net cost of the deal to about $780
million.

DODGERS FIRE GRAZIANO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bob Graziano, hand-picked by Peter O'Malley to
take the Los Angeles Dodgers into new ownership and the new
millenium, has been fired as club president after less than two
turbulent years on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano, who rose through the Dodgers finance department to
become the club's first CEO, oversaw the Fox-mandated trading of
Mike Piazza, the firing of manager Bill Russell and GM Fred Claire,
and the structuring of an $80 million payroll. He is the first of
many expected changes on the field and in the front office during
the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Welts, the head of Fox Sports who announced Graziano's
ouster, said the club will move quickly to name a successor,
although sources said Tuesday that Welts could wind up with the
job. He added that general manager Kevin Malone would be back for
the 2000 season despite the club's poor performance on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad day for the organization,'' said Welts, a former
NBA marketing whiz hired by Fox two months ago to oversee its
sports entities. ``But professional sports in the year 2000
requires a great range of skills. Bob's area is in finance, but
there are so many different elements that go into the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the turmoil that has surrounded the Dodgers since Fox
purchased the club in March 1998, Welts said he hopes fans realize
the team's lofty payroll and the scheduled $40 million in privately
funded renovations to Dodger Stadium are proof of a commitment to
bring a winner to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after the final home game last Sunday, the
organization began the construction of more than 40 luxury boxes on
the press-box level that will be ready by opening day 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of a growing plan to generate more revenue for the
club, which has lost a reported $45 million the past four years. As
club president, Graziano, 41, was responsible for the business side
of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   And as the club began a three-game series against the Giants in
San Francisco on Tuesday, Malone had scheduled meetings with his
lieutenants to determine the fate of manager Davey Johnson's
coaching staff. Like Malone, Johnson's job appears safe. A
decisions on the coaches is expected before next Sunday's final
game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in the front office also could be forthcoming. Graziano
hired or promoted department heads in business, finance and
accounting, and human resources.
</P>
<P>
   But to fans, the most significant difference next season will be
on the field, where the team was eliminated from the National
League Western Division race two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are committed to $66 million in salaries for next
season. But Graziano was told last month by Fox that he would be
allowed to absorb several guaranteed contracts if it made the team
more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   The firing, which had been rumored since July when Graziano did
not receive a vote of confidence from Fox, was Welts' decision.
</P>
<P>
   But Graziano also met Sunday with Fox president Peter Chernin.
Fox was hoping to announce a successor when Graziano was removed,
but with so many people invested in his regime, Graziano insisted
on addressing Dodgers employees Tuesday morning in the Stadium
Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disappointed,'' Graziano said. ``I know there has been a
lot of rumors about my position with the company since the All-Star
break. With rumors, there usually is some basis to them. This
wasn't a shock.''
</P>
<P>
   But it clearly was difficult for Graziano, who had been with the
organization since 1986. Asked his opinion on the qualifications of
his successor, Graziano said reluctantly, ``I think if I did, I
would give you a description of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Fox was impressed early on, Graziano, a USC graduate
and lifelong L.A. resident, never really shook his ties to the
O'Malley family, which owned the club for 46 years.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that the Dodgers had three managers and a losing
record during Graziano's presidency. But he stumbled attempting to
secure a long-term spring-training site after the club's longtime
spot in Vero Beach became financially untenable.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, Graziano and Malone also flew to the Dominican
Republic to offer a three-year, $4.5 million contract for Montreal
manager Felipe Alou, who used it as leverage to secure a better
deal with the lowly Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Welts said Graziano's record had nothing to do with the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about lack of ability,'' Welts said. ``It is about
our vision of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Welts also spoke about reaffirming the team's commitment to
community service and preservation of the club's rich history.
</P>
<P>
   Then when asked if Fox had done more to undo the tradition of
the organization, Welts said, ``If installing luxury boxes is a
break with tradition, then we plead guilty. We had the opportunity
to buy a lot of teams, but we bought this one because we were
interested in its history.''
</P>
<P>
   Graziano was in charge of the transition from the O'Malley
family to Rupert Murdoch's media empire and acknowledges it wasn't
smooth behind the scenes. He didn't name names but said
philosophies between the old guard and new management often
clashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to understand the Dodger tradition because it is a
special character, a special set of values that set it apart,'' he
said. ``Growing up around them in Los Angeles, you see that
closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that character, that integrity, that morality can be
difficult to maintain when there are so many new faces. I'm not
saying it's better, it's just different. But I hope the new person
understands that is what has set us apart from the rest.''

A NEW TURN IN THE LABYRINTH OF CIVIL RIGHTS CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ala., Texas, Ga., Pa., Colo.)   (af)  
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Corporate managers handle sexual harassment complaints all the
time. Think the following example is a no-brainer? Think again.
</P>
<P>
   After a woman who worked as a receptionist at the Birmingham,
Ala., office of the Dillard Paper Co. sued the company, another
employee there, Harry Merritt, acknowledged in a deposition that he
had told her that since a certain customer ``sure is taken with
you, why don't you take care of him sometime?'' according to a
court opinion. He also acknowledged having repeatedly used a vulgar
phrase telling her to scratch a part of his anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   Merritt contended that he had not harassed the woman. Shortly
after the company settled the receptionist's lawsuit, though, he
was dismissed. He said his boss told him, ``Your deposition was the
most damning to Dillard's case, and you no longer have a place
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Merritt sued, arguing that he had been wrongfully terminated in
retaliation for his testimony, which the company had told him to
provide. A federal district court threw out the case. But an
appeals court reinstated it, and Dillard settled the dispute last
year, during the trial, for an undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   How could a company find itself in legal trouble for dismissing
an employee for behavior admitted to in sworn testimony?
</P>
<P>
   Easily, it turns out. For although many employers have become
more sophisticated about responding to explicit charges of sexual,
racial or age discrimination, they often get tripped up in the
legal labyrinth that ensues.
</P>
<P>
   The most common mistake is to dismiss or discipline an employee
for what the company regards as real misdeeds, only to be accused
of punishing him or her for filing a discrimination claim or
lawsuit. And many have discovered to their consternation that
juries will award damages for such supposed retaliation, even if
they believe the discrimination charges are bogus.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the only trap. As Merritt's case makes clear,
lawsuits can draw in other employees, who must testify under oath
to lawyers from both sides. As Dillard Paper learned to its regret,
under federal civil rights law, such employees' statements cannot
be held against them, no matter what they say.
</P>
<P>
   Retaliation suits are ``like an iceberg, a hidden claim that a
lot of people don't know how to handle,'' said Michael P. Maslanka,
a partner at Clark, West, Keller, Butler &AMP; Ellis in Dallas.
``Retaliation resonates with the jury. They may not believe the
employer terminated someone because they are black, but they will
believe they terminated someone because they rocked the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   The paradox of using a law that was enacted to protect victims
of discrimination to benefit plaintiffs who make groundless charges
or employees who admit to offensive behavior was not lost on judges
for the 11 U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta, who upheld
Merritt's right to a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that our holding allows a man who admitted to
engaging in sexual harassment to take his termination case to a
jury,'' Judge Edward E. Carnes wrote. ``We are emphatically not
holding, however, that an alleged sexual harasser cannot be fired''
_ only that the dismissal cannot be based on the harasser's
participation in a civil rights law proceeding, his opinion stated.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Merritt said he was dismissed ``for
telling the truth.'' He also contended that the receptionist had
``made a lot of allegations about me that were untrue'' and that
``lots of things were taken out of context.'' Officials at Dillard
Paper, which is now part of Xpedx, a unit of the International
Paper Co., confirmed that a settlement had been reached.
</P>
<P>
   The number of civil rights employment lawsuits filed in federal
courts has stabilized in recent years at around 23,000 annually
after sharply rising in the mid-1990s, partly because the tight
labor market has made bosses more eager to keep their workers
happy.
</P>
<P>
   But lawsuits by employees contending that their bosses
retaliated against them for filing or aiding discrimination claims
still prove nettlesome for many managers. Retaliation claims now
account for 24 percent of all charges filed with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, up from 15 percent in 1992. &UR;  &LR; 
Employment law experts say juries are far more likely to believe
charges of retaliation _ thus making decisions to dismiss or
discipline employees who have already filed discrimination charges
legally treacherous, no matter what the facts are.
</P>
<P>
   Many managers ``may not realize that retaliation does not
require a valid underlying claim,'' said John D. Canoni, a partner
at the Nixon Peabody law firm in New York. ``You can have a
complaint that's totally bogus, unfounded and unrealistic, but if
someone reacts against you because of that claim, even if it was
bogus,'' you can win a retaliation suit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, over the last five years, employers lost a higher
percentage of retaliation lawsuits than of cases that accused them
of discrimination because of age, disability, race or sex,
according to Jury Verdict Research, a legal research firm and
publisher in Horsham, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   So what are the lessons for employers? In a nutshell: get rid of
problem employees quickly. Be aware that some employees might file
discrimination claims or lawsuits in an effort to protect their
jobs. If they do, and if you dismiss or discipline them later, be
sure to base your decision on facts collected independently by you
and be sure (italics)not(end italics) to cite depositions or
anything else connected with their lawsuits. &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &QC;  &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As an example of how badly things can go awry if employers are
careless, legal experts point to a ruling this year in which the
10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , in Denver, upheld a jury award
of $460,132 to an employee of Ortho Biotech Inc. who a jury found
was dismissed in retaliation for filing race discrimination charges
against the company.
</P>
<P>
   According to the appeals court opinion, the employee, Oliver
Medlock Jr., had a number of contentious encounters with his bosses
before he filed the equal-employment charges and, later, a
discrimination lawsuit. At one point, Medlock confronted a
supervisor after a meeting, accused him of building a file of
inaccurate information and threatened him physically if he
continued. Other conflicts ensued, but Ortho's senior managers did
not act on a recommendation from Medlock's boss that he be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   After Medlock filed his lawsuit, he was interviewed by the
company's lawyers in a deposition. A month later, he was suspended,
and soon after that he was dismissed. As Ortho explained in a
letter: ``As a result of issues raised in your deposition,
effective immediately, you are suspended from all duties on behalf
of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Big mistake. The letter provided Medlock ammunition that his
actual dismissal was in response to his discrimination charge.
Indeed, a jury found against Medlock on every claim but one _
retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court upheld the award in January. ``Taken in the
light most favorable to plaintiff, we must conclude the letters,
coupled with the close temporal proximity between plaintiff's
deposition and firing, directly support the jury's finding that
defendant terminated plaintiff in retaliation'' for his
discrimination claim, wrote Judge Carlos Lucero. The company has
appealed to the Supreme Court.

 &HT;    Swooning Mets give little fight
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shea Stadium. What a perfect place for a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   To the roar of planes flying into LaGuardia Airport next door,
the Mets continued their crash and burn that started a week ago in
Atlanta. The three-game sweep at Turner Field all but won the
Braves the NL East title. Their 9-3 win in the first of a
three-game series here Tuesday night just rubbed it in Mets faces,
making their wild card hopes that much dimmer.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have won four in a row over the Mets, bringing their
record against New York to eight of 10 this season and 17 of 22 the
past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who continued one of the worst nose dives in baseball
history with their seventh consecutive loss, desperately needed
this one and the remaining two for their wild card hopes. Just when
they thought it couldn't get any worse, it did.
</P>
<P>
   Orel Hershiser was nothing but a target on the mound as the
Braves tagged him for five hits and four runs in the first inning
before he was pulled facing the eighth batter of the game. The sole
out Hershiser collected in the shortest outing of his 16-year
career was a Brian Jordan sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last of three RBIs collected by three Braves
hitters in the inning before the first pitch of Hershiser's relief
from Octavio Dotel, a wild one, allowed Ryan Klesko to score from
third. The Braves batted around before leaving the bases loaded on
Gerald Williams' fly-out.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones kept his personal MVP rampage against the Mets to
a dull roar, with two singles in his first four at-bats. Every
batter in the Braves' starting lineup reached base, seven of them
in the decisive first inning. Jordan homered for the first time in
125 at-bats going back to Aug. 15 to add a run in the third inning
and finished with three RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine, who moved to 13-11, beat the Mets in consecutive
starts for his first back-to-back wins since the last time the
Braves went on a Montreal-New York road swing in late June and
early July. Glavine spent most of the night dominating hitters with
a pinpoint fastball and mixing in breaking balls.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' offense, which was one of the best in the National
League by the books, has been amazingly bad for the past week. In
the first six games of this losing streak, the Mets had gone
5-for-40 with runners in scoring position.

FOX CONTINUES TO PUT ITS MARK ON DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The latest personnel move by the Los Angeles
Dodgers is best summarized by the subtitle of Fox's ``X-Files''
movie:
</P>
<P>
   Fight the Future.
</P>
<P>
   The team owners at Fox continue to put their own mark on the
franchise _ it looks like a footprint _ by getting rid of anything
and anyone remotely connected to the former owner, Peter O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   Firing Dodgers President Bob Graziano, as the club did Tuesday,
hardly ranks with trading Mike Piazza for some bad fish or shoving
Tommy Lasorda into a corner office and telling him to stay out of
the dugout. But it certainly is the latest episode in an
increasingly gory drama.
</P>
<P>
   How is a Dodgers fan supposed to look at this and not feel
queasy, or queasier, about the team's future? Graziano was the
Dodgers' point man on all of the intimate financial details of the
sale and the stormy transition period.
</P>
<P>
   He had his critics, who viewed him as Fox's front man for the
changes of the last two seasons and potential changes down the
road. But he did understand the very unique character of the
franchise and its even more unique relationship with the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever he was asked about the wrenching changes in the
organization and the possible issues forthcoming, like ticket
prices and a new stadium, you didn't feel he was paying lip service
to the questions.
</P>
<P>
   That can't be said of the Foxies running the team, whose actions
speak for themselves _ the Piazza trade, all the dead bodies in the
1998 front office purge, and the hiring of outsiders (Kevin Malone,
Davey Johnson) with little understanding of the team's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Welts underscored that fact by his comments Tuesday. He's
the President of the Fox Sports Enterprises unit that oversees the
club, the fellow who ominously moved into the Dodgers offices, and
above Graziano in the food chain, earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was looking for a team president who understood the
revenue challenges of owning a baseball team in the 21st Century
and ``someone who understands the heritage of the organization, who
has the ability to weave the history of the Dodgers into future.''
</P>
<P>
   My personal B.S. detector alarm clanged loudly upon hearing
that. Based on that description, I asked Welts if that meant
Graziano's replacement would have personal, hands-on experience
within the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``There are candidates who fall into that
category, but someone doesn't necessarily have to have been part of
the organization to grasp what its history means.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the perfect answer, of course, because it allows Fox to
put just about anyone in charge and say he understands the
franchise. That's essentially the Fox modus operandi. All of Foxies
in charge _ Welts, Chase Carey and Peter Chernin _ say they
understand the team, even though they never came closer to the team
than a box seat before the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Under this criteria, I would be an excellent candidate for team
president. I have scrapbooks going back to 1958, can name all 25
members of the 1959 World Series team, including Chuck Essegian
Chuck Churn, and have been a member of the carping L.A. press since
the World Series team of 1974.
</P>
<P>
   While I sat ringside for the A's beating of the Dodgers, Welts
was a ballboy for the Seattle SuperSonics and Carey was an
undergraduate at Colgate. But they understand the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what Graziano had failed to do as president, Welts,
who spent 17 years in the NBA's marketing department before joining
Fox, did a pump-fake in the lane. ``Bob had different experiences
than I thought we needed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running teams in the year 2000 are different and more
challenging than they used to be. For any franchise, this is a very
complicated job which requires a tremendous range of skills.''
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking baseball skills here. The skills Welts means
are all the things that strike fear in fans _ selling name rights
to stadiums, raising ticket prices, finding ``new sources of
revenue'' (translation: new ways of digging deeper into your
pocket), negotiating public subsidies and positioning teams for new
stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano was disappointed, but he refused to criticize Welts or
anyone at Fox, other than saying he doesn't think the kind of
person Fox describes _ other than himself _ actually exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went searching for a General Manager, I didn't find
anyone out there who has (that) the kind of baseball and business
experience,'' said Graziano, who will stay with the club for a
brief period during this transition. ``I'm not saying he doesn't
exist, but I haven't met that person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is very hard to understand Dodgers tradition and
character. The organization has always had a special sort of
values, and I think you have to experience that closely to know
what that means. Having been with the team for 14 years, I think I
understood what it means.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Dodgers' sake, I hope they're successful in finding
that kind of person.''
</P>
<P>
   Welts wouldn't name names when asked for candidates. But it
would be a shock if Fox didn't talk to 1984 Olympic chief and
former commissioner Peter Ueberroth, who has the combination of
business sense and sports experience that fits the job description.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are you won't recognize any other names. Many baseball
owners serve as their own team president (San Francisco's Peter
Magowan, Baltimore's Peter Angelos), and those that don't usually
hire presidents who can read an annual report but couldn't score
game. The sports experience of the Angels' Tony Tavares, for
example, was limited to facility management before being put in
charge of the Angels and Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around a lot of sports teams and watched some good
organizations,'' said Welts, ``and success never comes without
change. But the Dodgers need change and need to improve. If you
want to characterize that change as turmoil, I guess you can.''
</P>
<P>
   And we will, until Fox proves us wrong or the team moves back to
Brooklyn, whichever comes first.

MAKING THE BEST OF A MESS
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This feature, which will appear regularly is a first-person
account by a manager about some aspect of his or her career. Carly
Fiorina is the Hewlett-Packard Company's new chief executive.)

By CARLY FIORINA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was 1984, I was 30 years old and working at AT&AMP;T. The
company's divestiture had just occurred, the Bell operating
companies had just been spun off, and things were in shambles.
Access Management, the division responsible for connecting
long-distance calls to local phone companies, was in the worst
shape. I decided that's where I wanted to work.
</P>
<P>
   People thought I was nuts. Nobody knows what they're doing,
people said. It's a mess. And that's exactly what appealed to me.
It was a wonderful challenge. I knew I could have a big impact, for
better or for worse.
</P>
<P>
   Access Management was an area about which I knew absolutely
nothing. I teamed up with two excellent engineers. I listened and I
learned. We discovered that the bills from the local companies were
AT&AMP;T's biggest single cost. And we had no idea whether we were
being charged the right amount.
</P>
<P>
   I've saved a picture from those days where I'm standing in a
room covered floor to ceiling with boxes filled with bills. A team
of us looked over every one of those bills manually for three or
four months and found significant overcharges.
</P>
<P>
   This is not something that most people would think of as fun.
Nevertheless, our goal became to verify every bill and prove every
overcharge. We decided we must create a billing verification
system. Eventually, this system was implemented all over the
country by hundreds of employees and saved the company hundreds of
millions of dollars. We had great fun accomplishing something
nobody thought we could.
</P>
<P>
   From this and other experiences, I have distilled seven
principles for personal, and business, growth and success:
</P>
<P>
   _ Seek tough challenges: they're more fun.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have an unflinching, clear-eyed vision of the goal, followed
by absolute clarity, realism and objectivity about what it really
will take to grow, to lead and to win.
</P>
<P>
   _ Understand that the only limits that really matter are those
you put on yourself, or that a business puts on itself. Most people
and businesses are capable of far more than they realize.
</P>
<P>
   _ Recognize the power of the team; no one succeeds alone.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Never, never, never, never give in,'' to quote Winston
Churchill. Most great wins happen on the last play.
</P>
<P>
   _ Strike a balance between confidence and humility _ enough
confidence to know that you can make a real difference, enough
humility to ask for help.
</P>
<P>
   _ Love what you do. Success requires passion.
</P>
<P>
   I learned these lessons in part by watching my parents. My
father had health issues; he was told he could never play football.
He went on to play terrific football. Raised in a tiny Texas town,
he became a professor and federal judge. My mother had a series of
stepmothers who didn't think much of developing girls and a father
who wouldn't pay for her college tuition. So she ran away from
home, in small-town Ohio, joined the Air Force, became an
accomplished artist and devoted herself to being interested and
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   I loved working the billing issue at Access Management. I did
not love law school. I wanted desperately to make my father proud
that his daughter would follow in his footsteps. Quitting was the
ultimate personal failure in my mind and his. Yet, in the end,
loving what I did was more important. But life went on. We laugh
about it today, and know we learned something valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Every experience in life, whether humble or grand, teaches a
lesson. The question is not if the lesson is taught, but rather if
it is learned.

NISHIMOTO MOVES TO HEAD OF CLASS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KERRY MURRAY  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Five years ago, Keri Nishimoto stood in a
line filled with other high school players at the Long Beach State
volleyball camp.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, each player would go through a drill and then jog to
the back of the line, chatting and laughing as he or she waited to
go again.
</P>
<P>
   Nishimoto, though, was different.
</P>
<P>
   She made a mistake and assistant coach Debbie Green corrected
her. Nishimoto then jogged to the back of the line like the rest of
her fellow campers. But unlike the others, she began practicing
what Green had just told her.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, Green knew she wanted the 5-7 setter from
Redlands High School to play for LBSU in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Brian Gimmillaro was skeptical at first, but Green said
she saw something in Nishimoto that would set her apart from the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   No, she was not a Sheri Sanders, the All-American who set with
such athletic grace for the 49ers in 1988 and 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was she a Sabrina Hernandez, the ultra-competitive 49ers'
setter of the early 1990s, and an All-American in '92.
</P>
<P>
   And Nishimoto knows that she does not possess the skills that
two-time AVCA Player of the Year Misty May revealed in her tenure
at Long Beach, dominating the entire court with her athleticism and
play above the net.
</P>
<P>
   What Nishimoto has to offer is different a trait that she not
only uses on the court, but in every other aspect of her life as
well.
</P>
<P>
   To state it simply, Nishimoto is smart, and after two years of
serving as back-up setter to May, the redshirt sophomore is finally
getting the chance to showcase just what her brainpower can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is much easier if you're able to use your
intelligence in competition,'' Gimmillaro said. ``And Keri is a
very bright player.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright is right.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Nishimoto earned a full scholarship not for volleyball,
but for her academic success. She was a class valedictorian at
Redlands who scored so well on her college entrance exam that she
was named a National Merit Scholar.
</P>
<P>
   Nishimoto probably could have applied to any school in the
country, but the setter had her sights set on playing volleyball
for Long Beach State.
</P>
<P>
   Each summer, she continued to attend the volleyball camps put on
by Gimmillaro and his staff, and by her junior year she decided to
make an oral commitment to the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, she found out that she was selected as a
President's Scholar at Long Beach, an honor that included an
academic scholarship to cover her education costs.
</P>
<P>
   The President's Scholar Program, started by Long Beach State
President Robert C. Maxson in 1995, awards National Merit students
and valedictorians with a scholarship package that includes
tuition, general student fees, books and paid housing in the dorms.
Eligible students are asked to write essays, which are then
considered by a committee.
</P>
<P>
   Since the program's inaugural year, there have been 308
President's Scholars, 12 of whom have been student-athletes.
Nishimoto is the only women's volleyball player to carry the
prestigious title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to come here for volleyball and if I could get a
scholarship that way it would mean one more scholarship for the
team,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   During her senior year at Redlands, Nishimoto did receive other
volleyball offers - most notably an invitation from Pacific, now
the No. 1 team in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   She said the decision difficult, but ultimately she and her
parents believed she would receive the best training at Long Beach
State.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who predominantly works with the 49ers setters, said many
of the girls from Nishimoto's class shied away from Long Beach
since May was only half way though her stay with the 49ers and
still going strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many would see setting behind Misty as a wasteful year,''
Green said. ``Keri saw it as an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the highly awarded May is gone, Gimmillaro has gone
back and forth between using Nishimoto and true freshman Brittany
Hochevar at the setting position.
</P>
<P>
   Hochevar got the start for the first three matches, but
Nishimoto made her debut in the second game of the USC match
(fourth match of season).
</P>
<P>
   Since that victory, Gimmillaro has tended to use Nishimoto in
some of the bigger matches, including matches against Hawaii and
Colorado. Hochevar got the start against No. 1 UOP last Saturday,
but after a game and a half, Gimmillaro once again turned to
Nishimoto.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has great emotional control,'' Gimmillaro said. ``I can
tell her something in the middle of the emotions of the match and
she can understand what I'm saying and execute it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nishimoto said the switching of the setters has been frustrating
because it can be difficult to get in synch with the team, but said
she knows that both her and Hochevar's different skills are needed
at different times.
</P>
<P>
   No matter who ultimately claims the position though, Nishimoto
said she plans to stick around and use all four years of her
eligibility. Although she is a sophomore as far as volleyball is
concerned, Nishimoto is nearing the point of senior status in her
academics.
</P>
<P>
   Graduate school, she said, is always an option. Meanwhile, she
just plans to continue hitting the books to maintain her almost
perfect GPA (Nishimoto has only one B) and focus on volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not Misty May and I'm not trying to be,'' Nishimoto said.
``I bring something different to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   So even if the 5-7 setter doesn't carry on the All-American
tradition at Long Beach, Nishimoto will leave the program with a
fully paid college education, and a reputation for high
intelligence, both on and off the court.

 &HT;    Officials: Ankiel worked for Bahamian smugglers
 &HT;    By Michael Van Sickler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT PIERCE, Fla. _ Richard Ankiel, the father of rookie St.
Louis Cardinals pitcher and Port St. Lucie High standout Rick
Ankiel has been linked with a sprawling Bahamian smuggling network
widely known as the Captain Jump-Off gang.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Ankiel, 42, and three others were charged by the U.S.
Attorney's Office with conspiracy to distribute marijuana and
cocaine. Ankiel faces a maximum prison sentence of 80 years and $4
million in fines on both charges.
</P>
<P>
   The federal charges were filed Sept. 22 against Ankiel; Phillip
W. Kennedy, 25, and Cindy L. Rohn, 42, and Dale Jackson, 41, both
of Fort Pierce. They are accused of moving ``vast quantities'' of
drugs for the smuggling ring, said Al Westerman, a U.S. Customs
Service agent in Fort Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel and the others were not arrested, Westerman said. They
are scheduled for a first appearance today in federal court in West
Palm Beach in front of U.S. Magistrate Linneas Johnson. Neither
Ankiel nor his son or other family members could be reached for
comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The charges are the result of a yearlong investigation into a
drug-smuggling operation led by Richard Barker, also known as
Captain Jump-Off. Barker, who was sentenced to life in prison in
June for drug smuggling, acquired the nickname Captain Jump-Off for
smuggling illegal immigrants and forcing them into the water at sea
rather than ferrying them safely to shore.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dozens arrested as a result of the investigation were
a U.S. Coast Guard petty officer in June and a Fort Pierce
volunteer police officer in late July.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel has a criminal history dating to four years before the
birth of his son. In 1975, Ankiel was found guilty of marijuana
possession and served 30 days in jail. Over the next 24 years, in
between Little League games and fishing trips with his son, Ankiel
was arrested 14 times on charges including burglary, carrying a
concealed weapon, aggravated assault, fleeing police, and hit and
run with an injury, according to Florida Department of Law
Enforcement records. Those records show he has at least six
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   In December, St. Lucie County sheriff's deputies responded to a
domestic battery call from the home of Cindy Rohn. She had a large
bump over her left eye and accused Ankiel of throwing her on the
tile floor. Ankiel, who is married, told deputies he was Rohn's
boyfriend, according to deputies' reports. Ankiel said he had been
in a tussle with his son and that he accidentally knocked into
Rohn. The charge was dropped the next day.
</P>
<P>
   On June 10, Ankiel was charged with driving under the influence.
He has an Oct. 12 court date on that charge.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Rohn, the others charged along with Ankiel
have extensive criminal records, according to Florida Department of
Law Enforcement records.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy has been arrested 28 times in six years, including
charges alleging marijuana possession, purchasing and possession of
cocaine, shoplifting, rape, car theft, and burglary. He has four
felony convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has been arrested 16 times over more than 25 years on
charges including hit and run, illegal use of a fishing net, and
possession of explosives with the intent to harm. He has one felony
conviction and numerous misdemeanor convictions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Jackson was arrested with 12 others who federal drug
agents said belonged to a Palm Beach County drug ring called the
Pinder Ring. The ring was named after Claude Avon Pinder, nicknamed
``Kingfish,'' who pitched a no-hitter for the 1957 Palm Beach High
School team and was scouted by the Yankees. Instead of pitching,
Pinder formed an extensive drug ring. He was sentenced to 30 years
in federal prison in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who was 30 at the time, was nicknamed ``Offload''
because he supposedly unloaded marijuana shipments. When he was
brought into the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office in 1988 for
questioning, he wore a ``Lanie Norvell for Sheriff'' baseball cap.

ADVERTISING: AT ATLANTIC MONTHLY, TENSE STAFF MEETS NEW OWNER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At The Atlantic Monthly in Boston on Monday afternoon, staff
members huddled around to hear the grim news.
</P>
<P>
   There was the crackle of interstate static. Then, the
disembodied voice of Mortimer Zuckerman, the New York real estate
baron who has owned the magazine since 1980, wafted tinnily through
the room: He was selling the magazine, a 142-year-old cultural
institution that printed the first published words of Emerson and
Thoreau.
</P>
<P>
   The news did not go over well _ partly because it was delivered
by Zuckerman via speakerphone, ``which was truly a postmodern
experience,'' one staff member said with a sniff. More important,
though, the staff was upset to learn that William Whitworth, the
editor who has steered the magazine for two decades, would be
replaced by someone unknown to them, a Washington editorial
upstart, Michael Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   But the tension was eased considerably by the soothing presence
of the new owner of the noble, barely profitable monthly. He is
David Bradley, chairman of a little-known research company, the
Advisory Board, and a little-known media company, the National
Journal Group, both based in Washington. A self-effacing
multimillionaire, Bradley, 46, speaks in tones so dulcet he sounds
more like a sympathetic psychotherapist _ or the sweet-natured
Rogers of television fame, perhaps _ than the ferocious new media
mogul on the block.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at the magazine's headquarters Tuesday to
confront a tearful staff at a noontime meeting, Bradley smoothed
ruffled feathers with such expertise and assurance that the
managing editor, Cullen Murphy, said employees who had been angry
or fearful were suddenly smiling. Bradley promised not to change
the editorial direction of the magazine; he also said he had no
immediate plans to change the makeup of the staff or move the
offices to Washington. ``Everyone felt a lot better after the
meeting,'' Murphy said. ``I did not expect that.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when most magazines that purport to address any
intellectual subject _ The New Republic, The Nation, Harper's, The
Atlantic Monthly _ are either supported by foundations or eke out a
small profit, Bradley may turn out to be the cowboy in the white
10-gallon hat. If he can turn The Atlantic Monthly into a
profitable venture that retains its original sense of mission _
delivering poetry, criticism and literature along with provocative
international and political reporting, a mixture that has earned it
nine prestigious National Magazine Awards in two decades _ he may
prove that magazines with an intellectual bent have a chance of
economic survival.
</P>
<P>
   Under Zuckerman's watch, an executive who works for his real
estate company said, The Atlantic Monthly typically lost $500,000
in a bad year and earned $500,000 in a good year. But Bradley, who
with a law degree from Georgetown University and an MBA from
Harvard is at his core a businessman, did not spend $17 million _
the figure cited by executives on both sides of the transaction _
to produce a magazine that loses money.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley seemed an unlikely candidate for media stardom until
just a few years ago. The Advisory Board, the company that he
founded in 1979 _ equipped with four card tables and four Princess
telephones, in his mother's Watergate apartment _ is, in Bradley's
words, ``a for-profit think tank.'' The company gathers research
for 3,000 American corporations in fields ranging from banking to
universities to health care.
</P>
<P>
   It was his purchase of the National Journal Group from Times
Mirror Co. in 1997 that transformed his growing empire from one of
policy research to one of politics and media savvy.
</P>
<P>
   Among the publications owned by the group are National Journal,
a weekly magazine of government and politics that has won two
National Magazine Awards; Government Executive, a monthly magazine
of government management; The Almanac of American Politics; The
Hotline, a daily Web-based publication covering political
reporting, and Congress Daily, a daily report from Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   National Journal, with a circulation of 7,000 and an annual
subscription price of $1,047, has a tiny audience. But since
Bradley raised the editorial budget by 50 percent and hired Kelly,
the deposed editor of The New Republic, to be editor in chief,
National Journal has attracted well-known writers like the legal
analyst Stuart Taylor; William Powers, who had been a press critic
for The Washington Post, and Carl Cannon, a former White House
correspondent for The Baltimore Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a safe test of entering into the magazine field,''
Bradley said, speaking of National Journal. ``It's got a
significant but limited readership. So you can make mistakes and
people will still be forgiving. But how do you step forward into a
much more frightening space? The Atlantic Monthly is a retail
magazine where you're not allowed to charge a thousand dollars for
a subscription and when you make mistakes you will be a source of
joy to people who like to read about stumbling.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   National Journal had one such moment in April, when Taylor found
himself in a conflict-of-interest battle after it was disclosed
that he had considered going to work for Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel. Taylor made apologies on every talk show in
existence, turning his stumble into an unwitting public-relations
coup for the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Bradley took part of his company public, netting
him $142 million. With his status as multimillionaire, and with the
National Journal Group and The Atlantic Monthly under his belt, he
has assured his spot in media moguldom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodness!'' he shrieked in a telephone interview Tuesday.
``How can you say that? What is fair to say is that I have
increased my share of interests in magazines. But look, Henry Luce
started Time when he was in his early 20s. I'm 46.'' So? ``I think
you need to start younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who will be editor in chief of The Atlantic Monthly, said
he had no plans to change anything. ``Making a business out of
creating and selling a great magazine _ a magazine that consciously
exists on a pretty high plane and does not dumb itself down or tart
itself up _ is a pretty tough row,'' he said. ``The identity of The
Atlantic Monthly is about literature and about journalism that
aspires to the level of literature. It is about the serious,
untrendy, un-buzz-driven discussion of ideas. All of those things
have to continue. That is what the magazine is.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the world of magazines depends for much of its revenue on
the world of advertising _ an industry known for its love of that
mysterious blend of public relations and cocktail-party chatter.
Alan Jurmain, the media partner at Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS, said: ``You
need some form of buzz. You'd like buzz to be something that comes
from within, that is authentic, and I think they have a terrific
product but they haven't had the wind at their back for a long
time. If this guy can create a breeze, they can be on their way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said he would begin spending a lot of time with the
magazine's staff in Boston. As for Bradley, the staff of The
Atlantic Monthly is still trying to figure out just who he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't there a novelist named David Bradley?'' said Murphy, the
managing editor. ``I guess that just shows where my head is at.''

WHITE HOUSE AND IMF GIVE ECUADOR THE COLD SHOULDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For five years now, the Clinton administration has
gone to extraordinary lengths to keep countries from defaulting on
loans to investors around the world, fearing that national
bankruptcy can set off political upheaval and international
economic chaos.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the White House bailed out Mexico in 1995, and why
Washington moved the financial heavens to rescue Thailand and South
Korea (successfully) and Indonesia and Russia (not exactly
victories for American-style capitalism).
</P>
<P>
   So it was more than a little curious that when tiny Ecuador,
hardly a strategic player in the post-Cold War world, finally drove
off a financial cliff this week, there was no one extending a net
to cushion the fall. Inside the U.S. Treasury, the central command
post in this era of global economic diplomacy, the message was that
Ecuador got its just desserts. For months it has been ignoring
warnings that it could no longer delay some enormously tough
political choices. Instead, it declared it could not _ and would
not _ pay many of the investors who had bought the country's Brady
Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   That was exactly the message that the new Treasury secretary,
Lawrence Summers, wanted to send to those investors. Since the
Asian economic crisis ebbed, Summers has warned over and over again
about the dangers of complacency, and said the United States and
the International Monetary Fund would not always step in to rescue
countries or their lenders. Finally, he proved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later, investors are going to discover that the
world isn't always going to step in to stop a default,'' one senior
administration official said. ``And if they understand it sooner,
it might prevent a bigger crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk underscores how much has changed since the last time
the world's finance ministers and central bankers clogged
Washington with their limousines for the annual meetings of the IMF
and World Bank. Back then the world seemed on the precipice of
economic disaster. Russia had just devalued its currency, Wall
Street was swooning, hedge funds were going under and the Federal
Reserve was cutting interest rates to breathe life back into the
world economy.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the feel is entirely different. Those finance
ministers and central bankers, bellying up to the appetizers at
receptions all over the city, are congratulating themselves for the
wisdom of their world-saving chess moves last year. The governor of
the Bank of France talked Tuesday morning about handing out ``coups
de chapeau'' _ tips of the hat _ to Asia and to the IMF and World
Bank. Several of his colleagues from other countries talked about
last year in the giddy terms of survivors who, to their shock,
walked away from a plane crash unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   All this has Summers worried, and at every opportunity he warns
against the dangers of complacency and says the biggest thing the
world should fear is ``the lack of fear itself.'' So Ecuador was a
chance to create a little fear in the markets _ and a little
discipline as investors jump back into emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   China Clams Up  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the ministers toasted each other, the Chinese dithered and
danced. On Monday, China's negotiator over the country's entry into
the World Trade Organization, Shi Guangsheng, arrived in
Washington, met with U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
and offered _ well, absolutely nothing new. Then he flew back to
Beijing, in time for the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barshefsky and her colleagues in the administration are
clearly mystified. For the last few months they have assumed that
China's reluctance to negotiate on the terms of its entry to the
WTO _ a deal nearly completed in April, until President Clinton
walked away _ was part of some great tactical plan hatched in
Beijing. The theory was that the Chinese, by waiting, were hoping
to translate the U.S. guilt over the bombing of their embassy in
Belgrade into easier terms for entering the WTO. They wanted
Clinton to publicly ask China to come back to the table _ exactly
what he did two weeks ago in New Zealand, at a meeting with
President Jiang Zemin. The meeting here was supposed to make
progress. It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Now some in the administration wonder if Ms. Barshefsky's
decision to publish a list of China's concessions in April was what
one senior White House official calls ``a huge mistake.'' Clearly
it made Prime Minister Zhu Rongji vulnerable to conservative forces
who want to kill any effort to allow foreign competitors equal
footing in China. The question is whether those conservatives have
the upper hand now, and that China is no longer willing to open up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who tells you they understand the Chinese strategy
here isn't telling you the truth,'' one official deeply involved in
the negotiations said today. ``In fact, we can't figure out whether
the Chinese know themselves what they want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Going to Bat for Russia  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neither Congress nor the White House is in any mood these days
to give financial aid to the money-laundering Russians, or the
corruption-ridden Indonesians, especially after the bloodshed of
East Timor. Tuesday, the head of the IMF, Michel Camdessus, had a
pretty clear response: Get over it. Some countries are too big to
cut off.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about Russia at the opening session of the IMF on
Tuesday, Camdessus said, ``it would be the height of
irresponsibility to turn our back on this great nation. We will not
do that.'' He urged that all the allegations of misappropriation of
funds should be weighed against seven years of ``real progress,''
and added that no one should ``ignore the fundamental decision, on
which Russia has not wavered, to seek to develop a modern market
economy and integrate itself into the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   He was somewhat less enthused about the progress of reform in
Indonesia, but clearly was anticipating that the election of a new
president would free up the IMF's coffers once again. And he talked
more about rebuilding East Timor than rebuilding Ecuador.

MEXICAN OPPOSITION PARTIES FAIL TO UNITE BEHIND ONE PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (inserts Cardenas quote after 7th graf)   (bl)  
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Talks among opposition parties to forge a
coalition that would back a single presidential candidate collapsed
on Tuesday, greatly increasing the chances that the party that has
controlled Mexico for seven decades will win power once again in
elections next year.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown of talks to form a coalition is a huge setback for
Mexican voters who hoped to see an opposition leader take the
presidency and its vast powers away from the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, which has elected every president since the
1920s. The results of recent opinion polls as well as most state
elections across the country show that these voters are in the
majority.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition could handily beat the governing party, or the
PRI, in the vote on July 2, 2000, if the parties and factions
joined forces. But if the opposition is divided among two or more
candidates, as will now be the case, each one will face an uphill
battle.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown came after four months of nearly round-the-clock
negotiations between the right-of-center National Action Party,
known as the PAN, and the other main opposition group, the
left-leaning Party of the Democratic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the PAN and its presidential candidate, Vicente Fox
Quesada, made the decision to reject the coalition. The PAN, a
pro-business party, could not muster enough trust in the Party of
the Democratic Revolution, which has often been its fierce
ideological opponent, to accept a face-off in a nationwide primary
to select a single candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The issue on which the coalition foundered was the rockiest one.
The two parties could not agree on how to choose between Fox, who
initiated his quixotic quest for presidency two years ago, and
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, the leader of the leftist party.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas resigned on Tuesday as mayor of Mexico City to launch
his third bid presidential bid. He is believed to have won once, in
1988, only to have it stolen from him by fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just shows that the PAN is not willing to submit a
historic decision to a popular vote,'' Cardenas said. ``It shows
that they are not ready to join the authentic opposition to the
PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The opposition parties named a council of 14 distinguished
citizens to come up with a method to break the deadlock. The
council suggested a hybrid approach combining proposals from the
two parties. It called for a primary of pre-registered voters to be
held with 12,000 polling stations across the country (far fewer
than in a regular national election), whose results would be
reninforced by opinion polls before the balloting and exit polls
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The Party of the Democratic Revolution as well as six other
small opposition parties that participated the coalition talks
accepted the council's plan.
</P>
<P>
   But in announcing the PAN's decision on Tuesday, Diego Fernandez
de Cevallos, a veteran PAN leader and its lead negotiator in the
talks, called the plan ``simply aberrant.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary ``is based on no electoral law and has no
authorities to monitor it and guarantee its fairness,'' Fernandez
de Cevallos said. ``Frankly, we are not interested in participating
in something so irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled an election Cardenas' organization held in March to
choose its own president. The first time around, the election ended
in chaos as the contenders loudly accused each other of vote
tampering. That election had to be canceled and a new, better
organized one held two months later.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez added that the citizens' council had failed to clarify
what would happen if the primary gave one result and the polls
turned up another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico doesn't come to an end if there is no alliance,'' he
said dismissively in a television interview early Tuesday. ``Mexico
will still be here.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the height of its powers in the 1960s and '70s the PRI faced
no serious opposition and won most elections by huge margins. But
the party's popularity eroded in the '90s as extravagant corruption
by its leaders came to light while millions of Mexicans were driven
into penury by its disastrous economic management.
</P>
<P>
   In recent elections, the PRI has shown it has the solid support
of about 40 percent. Consistent support for the PAN is slightly
below 30 percent, as is the showing for the Party of the Democratic
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans overwhelmingly wanted the opposition to join together.
In a national poll published on Tuesday morning by the daily
newspaper Reforma, 63 percent said they were in favor of the
opposition coalition while 24 percent were not.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also showed the chasm that has opened among voters. Fox
was favored to be the coalition candidate by 60 percent of those
interviewed, while only 19 percent favored Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles to a partnership between the two big opposition
parties were legion. Many PAN followers are fervent Catholics. The
party favors free trade and independent entrepreneurs and is
opposed to a dominant role for the state in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Party of the Democratic Revolution, by contrast, descends
from the tradition of Cardenas' father, the fondly-remembered
president who nationalized Mexico's oil industry. Its members
believe strongly in the country's strict separation of church and
state.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties have waged angry policy battles over the $96
billion bank bail-out and plans to privatize the electrical
industry, among other hot debates.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The coalition was also hampered by a restrictive federal
electoral law, written by the PRI, which makes alliances all but
impossible. In order to run a single presidential candidate, the
opposition parties also had to settle on one candidate for every
one of the hundreds of seats in the federal legislature, which also
has elections next year, and reduce television air time and
campaign spending to fit the limits for one party. The opposition
battled unsuccessfully to relax the law.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, the coalition must register formally by Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Fox's calculation was that he could continue to build his lead,
PAN officials said. If he is still ahead of Cardenas by an
indisputable margin as the election draws near, the law allows
Cardenas to step aside and deliver his voters to Fox.
</P>
<P>
   PAN officials said they feared that the rank-and-file of
Cardenas' party or the PRI would rig the election against Fox. They
were afraid that an ugly opposition feud over the results in
November, when the PRI is holding its own primary, would sink the
chance for any opposition candidate to win next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't make good sense to accept this proposal because the
risks were just too high,'' said Santiago Creel Miranda, who had
been the most devoted proponent of the alliance within the PAN.
</P>
<P>
   But many Mexicans were saddened by the sense that a historic
opportunity had been lost.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Camacho, the head of one of the smaller opposition
parties, said, ``If Vicente Fox is not capable of facing a primary
election when he has a two-to-one advantage, he doesn't deserve to
be the leader of the opposition _ or of Mexico.''

MUSEUM FILES FIRST-AMENDMENT SUIT OVER GIULIANI'S THREAT TO END
FUNDING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to add 16 grafs in form of 2nd take)  (bl)  
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a pronounced escalation of the political and
cultural conflict over an impending art exhibition, the Brooklyn
Museum of Art on Tuesday filed a lawsuit in federal court accusing
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of violating the First Amendment by
threatening to withdraw city funds from the museum because he finds
some of the artworks offensive and insulting to religion.
</P>
<P>
   In taking the action, the museum abandoned its recent efforts to
resolve the dispute through some form of negotiated compromise;
indeed, the museum's board of trustees voted overwhelmingly Tuesday
to reject Giuliani's request for another day of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   There was no more talk of removing or otherwise segregating
those works that the mayor deems most troubling. By preemptively
filing a lawsuit, museum officials said that they hoped to thrust
the dispute into the constitutional arena of free speech and
expression, thereby undercutting the city's legal strategy of
challenging the exhibit on the narrow grounds that it violates the
museum's lease with the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``This litigation is not just about the Brooklyn Museum of
Art,'' said Robert S. Rubin, the chairman of the museum's board of
trustees, during a tense late-afternoon press conference in the
museum's lobby. ``It is being undertaken in the interests of all
public institutions _ museums, universities and libraries _ that
are dedicated to the free exchange of ideas and information, and in
the interests of the people they serve.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The response from City Hall was swift and angry. Although
Giuliani was traveling Tuesday on a political trip to Washington,
D.C., and Las Vegas, Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota described the
mayor's reaction this way: ``The mayor was not surprised by the
level of arrogance shown by the board of the museum.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani immediately ordered city officials to cancel the city's
next scheduled payment to the museum _ $497,554 _ which is due Oct.
1.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he did not appear willing to take more drastic steps to
prevent the exhibition from going forward as planned Saturday. City
officials instead focused their immediate efforts on seizing
control of the museum through what they predicted would be
protracted litigation.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This board has decided to violate state law, violate the
provisions of their lease with the City of New York, and more
importantly violate the bylaws that they operate under,'' said
Lhota, who attended Tuesday's meeting of the museum board along
with city Corporation Counsel Michael Hess. Museum director Arnold
Lehman gave one indication of the museum's newly aggressive posture
when he politely but firmly evicted Hess and Lhota from a podium in
the museum's lobby, where they had paused after the board meeting
to answer reporter's questions. A short time later, Hess summed up
the rising emotions on both sides in a conversation with three
officials outside City Hall. ``We've got a big mess,'' he said.
``We've got World War III now.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, other religious and cultural organizations
joined the fray, staking out positions in a fight rich with
political implications for Giuliani's expected Senate race against
Hillary Rodham Clinton, as well as with legal implications for
publicly-funded art institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting the mayor was the Orthodox Union, the nation's
largest association of orthodox Jewish organizations, which issued
a statement Tuesday condemning the exhibit, especially a
dung-stained portrait of the Virgin Mary by the acclaimed British
artist Chris Ofili. ''Displaying a religious symbol splattered with
dung is deeply offensive and can hardly be said to have any
redeeming social or artistic value,'' the organization said.
``Today the offense is perpetrated against a Christian symbol;
tomorrow it might be a Jewish ritual item, and then of another
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Backing the museum was the Cultural Institutions Group, made up
of 33 city museums and arts organizations, which sent a letter to
the mayor Tuesday warning that his actions will have a ``chilling
effect'' on all city-funded museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation that New York City's government-assisted
institutions must make sure that city officials find inoffensive
every future exhibition or performance would cause lasting damage,
not only to the Brooklyn Museum of Art , but to all of our cultural
institutions, and to our City,'' said the letter, which was signed
by such leading cultural figures as Philippe de Montebello,
director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Glenn Lowry,
director of the Modern Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The museum's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn,
seeks a court order declaring that Giuliani ``may not inflict any
punishment, retaliation or sanction of any kind'' against the
museum for staging the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Such punishment, the suit said, includes terminating the
museum's lease, seizing the museum building, cutting off funding,
or firing the museum's Board of Trustees.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is represented by Floyd Abrams, one of the nation's
best-known First Amendment lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether city officials are obligated to finance artwork
they believe to be offensive, Abrams replied: ``There is no
obligation from the city to fund the arts. But the First Amendment
says, according to a wide, sustained, continuing body of case law,
that the funding process may not be used to coerce institutions
such as this to do the bidding of its political leaders. So while
New York never has to fund any museum, once New York starts down
that road, it cannot violate the First Amendment by a process of
coercion, sanction, threats, retribution and the like.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Hess, the corporation counsel, said, ``There's nothing in
the Constitution that says taxpayers should pay for an exhibit like
this, with some of the really disgusting-type paintings that are
being shown.''
</P>
<P>
   In planning its legal attack, the Giuliani administration has
focused on the city's lease with the museum, which dates to 1893
and was signed by the mayor of Brooklyn. The lease requires that
the museum ``shall at all reasonable times be free, open and
accessible to the public and private schools of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials have argued that the museum violated that
language by prohibiting children under 17 from attending the
exhibition without adult supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to deflate that argument, the museum board voted Tuesday
to eliminate the age restriction and instead simply post warning
signs advising parents ``of the challenging nature of certain of
the works.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams said: ``There is no denial of access on any theory at
all, and there should be no further talk from the mayor's camp
about leases or 105-year-old documents. This is a First Amendment
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's major cultural institutions have spent days debating
how best to respond to the mayor's threats, according to a series
of e-mail memos describing discussions among members of the
Cultural Institutions Group. The e-mail was provided by a person
who works for one of the institutions and who thought the group's
response should be stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The memos, drafted by the group's chairman, Alan Friedman,
showed that while most of the group's 33 members favored sending a
joint letter to the mayor warning that his actions would set ``a
dangerous precedent,'' other members argued that the group should
remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   Several members, Friedman wrote, noted that ``the mayor tends to
take those who disagree with him as enemies to be punished.''
</P>
<P>
   An administrator of one arts organization that belongs to the
group said Carnegie Hall and the Studio Museum in Harlem were among
those who were reluctant to sign a letter of protest. Officials
from both institutions did not return calls on Tuesday night
seeking comment. Neither institution signed the letter. Friedman,
director of the New York Hall of Science in Queens, argued for
immediate, united opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor is challenging the basis of all of our operating
agreements with the contention that if he finds even a single
element of our operations offensive, he is justified in revoking
our funding and our license to use a city-owned building,''
Friedman wrote to members Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Friedman gave this description of his efforts
to forge a consensus among the local museums: ``It's like herding
cats.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Not all bosses are jerks. A few are great, believe it
or not, and many are simply ``a sap'' like writer Dale Dauten says
he was when he owned a thriving market-re search firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``My employees loved me. I was much taken advantage of. I was
overpaying them and letting them do whatever they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, they loved me,'' muses the self-styled ``Corporate Curmud
geon,'' as he calls the seriocomic newspaper column he writes from
the office of his Tempe, Ariz., home. The weekly column on the
foibles of America's workplaces runs in 30 newspapers across the
country, in cluding ``The Arizona Republic,'' the ``Chicago
Tribune,'' the ``Minne apolis Star Tribune'' and the ``St. Louis
Post-Dispatch.'' He also co-authors another syndicated column with
even wider circulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was  &UR; not &LR;  a gifted boss,'' Dauten says with an authority
that comes from years of exploring what, ex actly, it takes to be
one.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in his fourth book, ``The Gifted Boss: How to Find, Create,
and Keep Great Employees,'' Dauten distills into little more than
100 pages of plain-spoken insight and unpretentious wit what he has
learned about transcending medioc rity _ not to mention avoiding
being a jerk or sap _ in the complex task of managing people.
</P>
<P>
   The new book, coupled with a loyal following of his columns and
wide exposure via his interactive Web site (would-be climbers of
corporate lad ders can take a test at www.dau ten.com to gauge
their promotability), has suddenly pro pelled Dauten beyond his
first love _ writing _ and increasingly onto the stage as a
professional speaker at corporate gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   He's delivering half a dozen speeches across the nation in an
eight-week period, and is a finalist for a booking in Paris. He
observes wryly that his fee of $7,500 per talk still puts him ``in
the bargain bin'' at about one-fifth the rate charged by another
Phoenix-area resident, can-do busi ness columnist Harvey Mackay,
and one-tenth that of Tom Peters, the acclaimed guru of excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't call his commentaries, which he delivers from a stool
a la Garrison Keillor, ``motivational speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I make fun of motivational speak ers,'' he said. ``I believe
people are self-motivated; you can't give it to them in a speech.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Gifted,'' Dauten calls upon his alter ego, the fictional
sage Max Elmore he introduced in his 1996 book, ``The Max
Strategy,'' to im part the keys to being a superboss. Through
focused conversation and easy repartee, plus visits to a couple of
Phoenix workplaces, Max does so in just 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, it took the 48-year-old Dauten a lot longer to get
the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   Academically, he was a whiz even beyond what could be expected
of the son of an Arizona State Univer sity business professor and a
devoted homemaker mother. By age 21, he had completed bachelor's
and mas ter's degrees in economics at ASU and was enrolled in a
doctoral program at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Not ready to commit to the professo rial life, he came back to
the Phoenix area and went to work.
</P>
<P>
   Dauten admits having failed to recognize that his first boss, an
explosive executive at the Phoenix headquarters of U-Haul's parent,
Amerco, was truly gifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was terrified instead of inspired by him. His displays of
temper and other extremes of good-old-boy phe nomena just left me
appalled,'' Dau ten said. ``I could have learned more from him,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   When the young market researcher moved on, he fit in better at
the old Armour-Dial Inc., a subsidiary of Phoenix-based Greyhound
Corp. during the mid-1970s. He rose within a couple of years to
manager of market research for a company that was racking up
successes rolling out such products as new antiperspirants and
Coast soap. It sent him to New York for a week of specialized
training every month.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he was noticed as a star performer, or ``Wild Brain'' as
he calls it in his book, and was recruited by a national
market-research firm. That started his career in consulting, first
in Dallas and then, with another company, in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would gather all these tables of numbers around me, and they
would speak to me,'' he recalled as if from a past life.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath his numbers wizardry, how ever, lay a deep yearning to
write.
</P>
<P>
   By age 30, he had founded his own market-research firm in
Atlanta, be come a father and somehow found time to write his first
book, ``Quit ting,'' ``a study of big changes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was done in a market-research type of way,'' Dauten said,
``and it showed I needed to learn how to write. I was still an
academic _ the longer the word, the longer the sentence, the more
profound it must be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assumed that if I wrote a book of any substance it would
find an audience.'' It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole career has been charac terized by naivete,''
confesses the man who now finds himself giving career advice. He
collaborates with New York job counselor Kate Wen dleton to produce
``Kate &AMP; Dale Talk Jobs,'' a weekly question-and-answer column
appearing in more than 100 newspapers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm telling people how to manage, how to live their
lives?'' he asked mockingly.
</P>
<P>
   He knocks himself for not having realized years ago that the
employees of his multimillion-dollar company should have been
solving most of their work problems themselves in stead of dumping
them on him. And he confesses that as a boss, he wasn't even
resolute enough to make it stick when he fired an employee he
remembers as chronically undepend able.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fired her half a dozen times, and she kept coming back,''
Dauten said. It was his wife, Sandy, now a leading saleswoman for
Shea Homes and a plenty dependable mother for their two teenage
boys still at home and a 19-year-old daughter who has left the
nest.
</P>
<P>
   Although his Atlanta firm had only five employees and was a
pioneer in farming out volumes of work before ``outsourcing'' was
even a common business term, it projected a big business image
through a quarterly newsletter. That helped reel in and retain such
powerhouse clients as Procter &AMP; Gamble, AT&AMP;T, McDon ald's,
Gillette, Colgate and Coors.
</P>
<P>
   Dauten says it was because he started running out of serious
ideas for the newsletter that he began writing tongue-in-cheek
commentar ies. Clients were delighted, one liken ing them to the
work of the era's consummate curmudgeon, Andy Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the mid-1980s, Dauten au thored a second book, this one
far more readable, called ``Taking Chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale of his business to employees in 1988 gave the family
resources to move almost anywhere, he says. After a halting stint
in the Los Angeles area, the choice was to come home to Tempe,
where he had grown up from age 10, graduated from McClintock High
School and where he and Sandy had met at ASU.
</P>
<P>
   His love of the city eventually turned into six years of service
on its Planning and Zoning Commission. Term limits ended his tenure
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Dauten's ``Corporate Curmudgeon'' column first got ink eight
years ago after Jim Fickess, now a team leader in the Business
section of ``The Arizona Republic,'' agreed to run it when he was
business editor at Tribune Newspapers in suburban Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year later, Dauten got a call from King Features
Syndicate in New York offering him a contract. Until his column
went into national syndication, it hadn't paid him a penny.
</P>
<P>
   As the Corporate Curmudgeon, do ing take-offs on memos to
employees from the pompous managerial ranks of Mundane Industries,
Dauten can wield a saber as sharply ticklish as Dilbert's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The examined life is a process of peeling away the layers of
stupidity,'' he observes in ``Gifted.''
</P>
<P>
   He also is a wordsmith who, in a touching column written from an
employee's viewpoint, tells bosses everywhere, ``I only work for
people who look up to me, even from the top floor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an affirmation that, hey, I'm not alone out here battling
these forces against us,'' said ardent fan Dan Hagerman, who worked
his way into management after starting 20 years ago as a
deliveryman in the food-service business.
</P>
<P>
   Hagerman discovered Dauten's col umns in Minneapolis before
moving to Scottsdale three years ago, and credits them as one of
the influences behind his shift to a new career: conducting
training programs for corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   Dauten is hard-pressed to define how he came by his ability to
inspire through humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always was a wise-ass _ that much came naturally,'' he
offers with one of the impish smiles that break readily above a
sharp chin and graying goatee. It also helped that, along with many
of the rewards of business success, he had steady doses of
corporate America's euphemistic jargon and eternal politicking.
</P>
<P>
   Once, a company paid him $10,000 to research whether the prize
it would be giving away in a contest should be a teddy bear or a
unicorn.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Here's a coin; why don't you just flip it?,' I wanted to
tell them,'' Dauten says with a shrug. They had referred the
monumental question to him, he later learned, because rival
executives had differed on the choice of a prize and subordinates
were afraid to align themselves with either one until they had
market data in hand to justify their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Reader response to his columns keeps him well stocked with
material about the best and worst of the business world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a stream of letters from employees _ mostly
dissatisfied, many out of work _ and I get wonderful ideas from
managers and entrepreneurs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here in the delta of ideas and information, and I get to
pick what to write about.'' &QL;

ALASKA AIRLINES PLANS TO OFFER A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS PASSENGERS TO
CHECK IN ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines, which pioneered the airline industry's adoption
of electronic tickets, is using the Internet in an attempt to
revolutionize checking in at airports, a process that is often
arduous.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier, based in Seattle, is currently testing a new online
check-in system, the first developed by a United States airline. It
expects to offer the system in early October to travelers who have
bought electronic tickets on its Web site and are flying on its
domestic routes. Alaska Airlines currently sells only electronic
tickets on its site; purchasers can also obtain their seat
assignment on line.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers will be able to use the new check-in system only on
the day they fly, at least one hour before departure. It will ask
them the same security questions about luggage they are currently
asked at the airport; once they answer these satisfactorily, they
will be able to print out a boarding pass on their own computer
printer. They can present this pass at the airport before
departure.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers with luggage will be able to check their baggage with
a skycap or elsewhere at the airport. All travelers will still be
required to present photo identification to an agent before
boarding.
</P>
<P>
   Ed White, Alaska Airlines' vice president for customer service,
said the main benefit of checking in on line would be convenience.
``There's no line at home, and no wait,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Alaska Airlines will allow all travelers who have
purchased electronic tickets through any means _ from travel agents
or by telephone from the carrier _ and who are flying anywhere on
the airline's route system to check in online, White said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear if such a system will spread to other airlines. A
Delta Air Lines representative said the carrier was studying the
matter. A spokesman for UAL's United Airlines said that airline had
no plans at present to offer online check-in service. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hotel Update &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Swissotel Washington, in the Watergate complex, has
undergone a $13 million renovation. All 250 guest rooms _ including
12 presidential suites _ have been refurbished. Guest room
balconies, which offer views of the Potomac River, have also been
restored. In addition, Jacques Van Staden, former sous-chef of
Jean-Louis, the highly acclaimed restaurant once housed in the
hotel, has been named chef of Aquarelle, its current restaurant.
The Swissotel Washington is owned by Blackstone Real Estate
Advisors, part of the Blackstone Group.
</P>
<P>
   The Reliance Building in Chicago has been converted into a
122-room hotel named the Burnham, after Daniel Burnham, the
building's original architect. This 105-year-old landmark, at the
corner of State and Washington Streets, has undergone a $28 million
renovation that is faithful to Burnham's design and preserves many
of his architectural elements. The Hotel Burnham is owned by Canal
Street Hotel LLC and is managed by Kimpton Hotel and Restaurant
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton Hotels has opened a new 600-room, $100 million hotel at
Logan International Airport in Boston. It has a 75-room executive
level, a 6,600-square-foot health club, and meeting and
teleconferencing sites. The hotel is offering a special rate of
$169 a night through Oct. 15. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lost and Found &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Returnme.com, a new online service, helps travelers find items
lost in transit. Users pay $9.95 for 12 identification stickers,
which contain a unique number for each user and information on
notifyingthe service. Travelers can put stickers on their laptops,
electronic organizers, cell phones and the like. If an item is
lost, the finder can notify Returnme.com, which will trace it to
its owner.
</P>
<P>
   The company charges $14.95 plus Federal Express costs for return
of a lost item; it also recommends payment of a reward to the
finder. Returnme.com is on line (www.returnme.com) or can be
reached by phone at (800) 779-1144. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Travel Costs &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American Express predicts a respite next year from recent major
increases in business travel costs. The company projects these
expenses will rise only 2 percent to 3 percent over all, with the
greatest increases coming in hotel rates, up an estimated 5 percent
to 7 percent, and telecommunications fees, up an estimated 7
percent to 8 percent. &QL;

OLIVETTI REJIGGERING TELECOM ITALIA TO PAY DEBT
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Olivetti S.p.A., the Italian company that gained control
of Telecom Italia in May, said Tuesday that it was reshuffling the
telecommunications giant in a move that will help repay the debt
Olivetti took on to acquire its larger domestic rival.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Colaninno, the Olivetti chairman who engineered the
takeover, said that Telecom Italia would shift its 60 percent stake
in Telecom Italia Mobile, a lucrative mobile phone unit, to Tecnost
, an Olivetti gambling machine subsidiary. Olivetti owns about 52
percent of Telecom Italia, and Colaninno said that minority
shareholders in Telecom Italia would receive Tecnost shares in
exchange for Telecom Italia Mobile.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti had parked the $15.6 billion of debt it took on to
acquire Telecom Italia in Tecnost. But rising interest rates since
the takeover have increased the burden on Tecnost and helped drive
down Olivetti's stock price about 22 percent since its offer for
Telecom Italia shares closed.
</P>
<P>
   Colaninno, announcing the moves at a news conference in Milan,
described them as `'industrial, not financial,'' and said they
would better enable Telecom Italia to aggressively pursue its
business around fixed-line data and Internet transmission, while
Telecom Italia Mobile could expand its thriving cellular phone
business.
</P>
<P>
   The mobile phone unit has been the group's cash cow, making up
for a slower fixed-line phone business. This year, the number of
cellular phones in Italy surpassed the number of fixed-line phones
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Tuesday night after the boards of
Olivetti, Tecnost and Telecom Italia approved the plans at meetings
in Milan, the companies said that Telecom Italia's minority
stockholders would receive between 1.5 and 1.65 Tecnost shares for
each of their own shares in payment for Telecom Italia Mobile. At
current market prices, the 60 percent stake held by Telecom Italia
is worth about $24 billion, so each share of Telecom Italia Mobile
is worth roughly 2.4 Tecnost shares.
</P>
<P>
   To sweeten the offer, the companies said Telecom Italia would
begin a $4.6 billion buyback of up to 742 million of its nonvoting
shares at a price of 6 euros, or $6.30, each. That price, they
said, represents a 12 percent to 14 percent premium over the
average share price of the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   The reshuffling is intended at least in part to route some of
Telecom Italia's cash flow to Tecnost to help pay the debt. Tecnost
is 70 percent-controlled by Olivetti, but the move would cause that
to drop to a level between 41 percent and 43 percent, the companies
said.
</P>
<P>
   The potential losers would be minority shareholders in Telecom
Italia, who would be compensated with the smaller number of Tecnost
shares than the market value of what they are giving up.

`GIFTED' BOSSES FOUND HERE
 AND THERE

The Gifted Boss: How to Find, Create and Keep Great Employees 
By Dale Dauten (William Morrow and Co., $20) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Syndicated business columnist Dale Dauten's ``The Gifted Boss''
opens with a set of characteristics so uncomplicated they fit on a
single page. It's through the rest of his compact volume that the
ideals he calls ``The Six Realities of Gifted Bosses and Great
Employees'' come to life, illuminated by about 50 individuals and
companies.
</P>
<P>
   He found as many as a dozen of the examples in the balmy Phoenix
metropolitan area, where he lives, and the second-largest batch in
the Twin Cities area, where he has had business ties.
</P>
<P>
   Examples range from John Genzale, now editor of the national
magazine ``SportsBusiness Journal,'' who in spired better staff
writing by holding weekly poetry readings in the news room of the
Phoenix ``Business Journal,'' to Tempe-based Insight Group, whose
founding brothers built their headquarters in the shape of an X to
help ensure that employ ees from all sectors would cross paths.
</P>
<P>
   The book's most touching anecdote tells of the extraordinary
esprit de corps shown by Insight personnel, including Chief
Executive Eric Crown, when a key employee re turned to work after
chemotherapy. Scores of co-workers, including women and the big
boss himself, had their heads shaved in solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps none of the gifted bosses Dauten writes about is a
perfect manager, he concedes, but each illustrates one or more
aspects of what it takes to be great. And sometimes, he points out,
the solu tion to a bad-boss trait is as simple as the advice he
quotes from former Porsche CEO Peter Schutz: ``Stop doing that!''
</P>
<P>
   The book's central message is that the highest function of a
boss is to create ``the best place for the best people to work''
and to focus unlimited attention on recruiting only the type of
people _ ``Wild Brains,'' Dauten calls them _ who immediately
become the star per formers of whatever tasks they take on.
</P>
<P>
   As in Dauten's 1996 book, the equally slim and pithy ``The Max
Strategy: How a Businessman Got Stuck at an Airport and Learned to
Make His Career Take Off'' (the title was imposed on him, he says
rue fully), Dauten lets an eccentric oracle of management, the
fictional Max Elmore, serve as the agent of change. In both books,
the narrator, a middle manager who has caught a whiff of smoke from
impending burnout, rep resents the author himself at critical
stages of his career, Dauten says.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier book was a contempla tion of career paths (skip the
rigid goal-setting exercises you read about elsewhere, because
success is ``usu ally an accident''); innovation (``ex periments
never fail'' if you learn from them); and quality (a favorite
theme: ``Different isn't always better, but better is always
different'').
</P>
<P>
   In ``Gifted,'' retiree Max, described as ``a kid in an aging
body, fizzing with the wisdom of nearly eight decades of
curiosity,'' reconnects in Phoenix with his disciple.
</P>
<P>
   Readers will judge for themselves whether the Max persona rings
true or ultimately distracts as he repeat edly drives home points
by punching the narrator's shoulder, gripping his knee, putting a
fatherly arm around him during a stroll through down town Phoenix
or jabbing a finger or fist into the air.
</P>
<P>
   But physicality aside, Max is one savvy interpreter of how an
earnest manager can keep everyone in an organization so blissfully
productive that the manager's own bosses ``lie awake at night and
thank the Lord that you work for them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental task of the best manager is not to manage,''
he counsels. ``The job of the gifted boss is to create a magnetic
environment, one capable of attracting great em ployees _ the kind
who don't need management, who lift up their co-workers and even
their boss.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BOOK'S KEY POINTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ``Six Realities of Gifted Bosses and Great Employees'':
</P>
<P>
   1. The ``talent-squared'' workplace is possible because gifted
bosses and great employees want the same things from a workplace:
</P>
<P>
   _ Freedom from management, mediocrity and morons.
</P>
<P>
   _ A change.
</P>
<P>
   _ A chance.
</P>
<P>
   2. Gifted bosses don't just hire employees, they acquire allies.
</P>
<P>
   3. Great employees don't have jobs, they have talents. They
enter the job market once (if at all), and thereafter their talents
are spotted, courted and won over.
</P>
<P>
   4. Great bosses and employees often reverse the typical job
search: Instead of the employee doing the ``hunting,'' it's the
boss. The process more resembles a ``talent search'' than a ``job
market.''
</P>
<P>
   5. While many gifted bosses have created such special work
environments that they have virtually no turnover, many others
embrace substantial turnover and become masters of ``the secret
skill'' of firing.
</P>
<P>
   6. An alliance between a gifted boss and a great employee is a
kinship of talent, often creating a bond that can last a lifetime. &QL;

METS NEVER GET STARTED, BUT SURE LOOK FINISHED

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sweat had barely beaded around Orel Hershiser's
nose when he slinked back to the dugout, but the blankness in his
face indicated a complete lack of understanding of how this fiasco
could happen _ a helplessness with which the Mets have grown
terribly familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The end came quickly and painfully for the Mets on Tuesday
night, much as their season appears to be headed for an abrupt and
galling conclusion. The Atlanta Braves, who began this reign of
terror a week ago, came to Shea Stadium to meet the staggering Mets
and all but dropped an anvil on their heads with a 9-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Mets' seventh loss in a row and kept them a game and
a half behind Houston for the wild-card playoff spot with five
games to play. The Reds beat the Astros, 4-1, in Houston to take
over first place in the National League Central Division.
</P>
<P>
   It tells you something about the quality of a game when the
first spike of excitement is for an enraged relief pitcher, Dennis
Cook of the Mets, who was ejected in the eighth inning for
screaming at the home-plate umpire after he was yanked by the Mets.
Before Cook left the field, he carefully nudged dirt onto home
plate, an act of passion and defiance the Mets only wished they
could replicate at bat.
</P>
<P>
   If the previous six losses were frustrating, then this one _ all
but decided in the first half of the first inning _ was
humiliating. The Mets, who only a week ago were regarded as among
baseball's elite, looked like a team that has hopelessly lost its
way and, occasionally, some of its will, too. Now the Mets must
hope the Reds or Astros, who are battling for the Central title,
drop below them or else they will face an ignominious ending that
will easily eclipse last year's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   With the offense slumping on the Mets' debacle of a road trip,
superb pitching had kept the Mets in every game. But Tuesday night,
Hershiser hadn't been on the mound long enough to even warm up.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Hershiser has typically been good for six innings
and in his previous 10 starts, his earned run average was 3.78.
This time, Hershiser wasn't good for six outs.
</P>
<P>
   His control missing from the beginning, Hershiser plunked Gerald
Williams, the first batter of the game, on the back with his third
pitch. And that was the best Hershiser would do. He fell behind the
rest of the Braves he faced. On a 2-1 count, Bret Boone slapped a
single to right field and Williams, running with the pitch, went to
third. That brought up Chipper Jones, who almost single-handedly
swept the Mets in Atlanta last week. On a 3-2 pitch, he hit a
broken-bat single to right field to score the first run. Such
little damage is considered a victory against Jones these days.
</P>
<P>
   But with runners at the corners, Ryan Klesko, on a 1-0 count,
hit another soft single, this time in the gap between third and
short to score Boone. That was when the boos began. Brian Jordan,
who had been questionable to play because of the sore hand that has
hampered him for week, hit a shallow fly in left field. Rickey
Henderson's throw was off-line, drawing catcher Mike Piazza up the
first-base line, and Jones scored.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were already down by 3-0, and there was still only one
out. Next up was Andruw Jones. On a 1-0 count, he singled to right
to move Klesko to second. Greg Myers, batting eighth, dinked a 3-0
pitch to short left field to load the bases. The shortstop Jose
Hernandez was next and Hershiser delivered a first-pitch ball.
</P>
<P>
   That was all. The pitching coach Dave Wallace scurried to the
mound and removed Hershiser. No Mets greeted him at the steps of
the dugout. It was the briefest outing of Hershiser's 16-year major
league career _ only one-third of an inning.
</P>
<P>
   When the rookie Octavio Dotel, the reliever, threw a wild pitch
on his first heave, the fourth run of the inning scored. With the
count at 3-0 to Hernandez, Dotel was the recipient of three
straight generous strike calls from the home-plate umpire Alfonzo
Marquez, one of the recently hired umpires. After he walked pitcher
Tom Glavine to load the bases again, Williams _ who had led off the
25-minute half-inning _ flied out to right field, the hardest hit
ball of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser had allowed four runs on five hits, a nightmarish
outing not only for him, but for a team that had scored 12 runs in
its last six games.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets finally managed one run in the sixth inning, and had
another chance in the eighth. But that inning was a microcosm of
everything that has gone wrong. The inning opened with a Henderson
double and Shawon Dunston single, but John Olerud flied out, Piazza
grounded out to score the run and Edgardo Alfonzo flied out to end
the inning. One more run, but essentially an act of futility. A
fitting symbol for the Mets long spiral down.

SPORTS COLUMN: WILD CARD CONFUSED THE METS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BBN-METS-BRAVES) 
(nk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While watching the Mets plod, like sleepwalkers on
their way toward an open window, I have wondered why they did not
show more of a sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't they get it? They were blowing their whole season,
potentially going down in history for two consecutive late-season
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   At first, I attributed the Mets' serenity to maturity and
professionalism, both admirable traits, and maybe that is true.
They were not playing that terribly, just zombie-like enough to
lose _ and besides, I never use the word ``choke.'' I think it is
an athlete's word, not a journalist's.
</P>
<P>
   But the more I think about it, the Mets have been caught in a
twilight zone between a pennant race and a wild-card race. They
didn't know which way to look.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets look like me on jet lag whenever I go to England. I
step off the curb, look left and nearly get smeared by one of those
double-decker buses bearing down on my right.
</P>
<P>
   In danger of being run down by history, the Mets went catatonic
Tuesday night and rode their losing streak to seven games with a
9-3 loss to Chipper Jones and the other big bullies from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   As best as I can figure it out, the Mets' identity crisis is a
result of baseball's expanding the post-season in 1995, adding a
wild-card slot to three divisions in each league.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days it was win the pennant, or else. When Richie
Ashburn threw out Cal Abrams at home and Dick Sisler hit a home run
on the last day of the 1950 season, the Phillies won the pennant
and the Brooklyn Dodgers most emphatically did not. None of this
namby-pamby wild-card business. Sorry, boys of summer. Go home and
sell insurance or tend bar.
</P>
<P>
   Even when baseball went to four divisions in 1969, teams could
put together wonderful seasons, but on the last home game of the
regular season all they could do was wave to their fans and thank
them for their patronage. Tough. I remember Whitey Herzog laughing
after the 1985 season, because Herzog was going to the post-season
and the Mets, who had chased his Cardinals gallantly down the
stretch, were not.
</P>
<P>
   Since baseball got permissive and opened up the post-season from
four teams to eight in 1995, dozens of teams are contenders for the
wild-card spots. This surely adds excitement for the teams on the
fringe. I will never forget good old Donnie Baseball raging at the
suggestion that a wild-card berth wasn't good enough for the 1995
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   I forget the captain's exact words, but the gist of it was:
``Are you people out of your minds? Winning is winning. The whole
thing is getting into the playoffs.'' And Mattingly had the right
to his passion, never having been in the post-season before. The
Yankees did make it, and conducted that epic five-game series with
Seattle, one of the best post-season series I have ever covered,
which more or less justified the wild card in my mind ever since.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a difference between the 1995 Yankees, who
knew they were playing for a wild-card spot, and the 1999 Mets. We
won't get into the leadership skills of Mattingly and Cone, as
opposed to the apparently passive Mets.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Keith Hernandez showed up on the field before last
night's game _ one fan behind the dugout waved a ``17 Hernandez''
shirt _ and undoubtedly the fans would have liked to bottle some of
his urgency and slip it into the veins of these vanilla Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, a transfusion from Knight, Mookie, Lenny,
Wally, Raffy, Bobby O, Roger and the Kid wouldn't hurt, either.
(You ask: How many pennants did that bunch win? Fair question.
Exactly one. But they were a swashbuckling lot, all the same.)
</P>
<P>
   These current blokes obviously wanted to beat the Braves and get
into first place last week, but who is to say they were not
laboring under a false sense of security: Hey, if we can't beat
Chipper Jones, there's always the wild card.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets lost three in Atlanta, they fell into a lethargic
groove in Philadelphia (and don't forget, Rickey Henderson was
easily distracted when he was 25 and 30 and 35, too.) Meanwhile,
those delightful small-market, small-budget Reds roared right past
the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets can't snap out of it, they will merely be blowing a
wild-card spot, like some marginal hockey or basketball team with a
so-so record. They may never demonstrate the ghastly pall of some
old-time team that knew it had blown a pennant down the stretch.
The fans _ and history _ just might judge the Mets a bit more
harshly.

CONGRESS EXTENDS SPENDING BY 3 WEEKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to delete `$4.7 billion' from last graf)   (bl)  
 By TIM WEINER  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Unable to pass its appropriations bills before the
new fiscal year begins on Friday, Congress resolved on Tuesday to
keep federal agencies functioning for three weeks while Republicans
negotiate with President Clinton over hundreds of billions of
dollars of spending.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the stop-gap spending measure, called a continuing
resolution, has become a nearly annual event. Congress has met the
fiscal deadline only four times in the past 22 years. But this
year, the stakes are higher.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders vowed repeatedly to pass the spending bills
on time, keep them within spending limits Congress imposed in 1997,
and abstain from spending surplus Social Security money to run
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The first of those promises is now broken. The second will be
broken soon, according to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. And
the third _ the pledge to keep Congress' hands off Social Security
_ is very much in doubt, even though the House on Tuesday passed,
by a 417-2 vote, a non-binding resolution vowing not to spend the
retirement money.
</P>
<P>
   After that vote, Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., one of the staunchest
fiscal conservatives in the Republican ranks, said it was still
possible to keep Congress from spending Social Security surpluses.
``We have a strategy,'' Coburn said. ``We're working on it. We
don't know if it's going to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who routinely spent surplus Social Security money to
run government operations during most of the years from 1955
through 1994 when they controlled the House, where spending bills
originate, ridiculed the non-binding resolution, though almost all
of them voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt compared it to ``saying
we're going to quit smoking while we're having a cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   Debate on the continuing spending resolution was short and
occasionally bitter. Republicans said little as Democrats chided
them for the failure to pass the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., the ranking minority member on the
House Appropriations Committee, said the Republicans' rhetoric
about spending and Social Security was a form of fiction designed
to delude the American people. ``If it isn't a public lie, it is
the largest fib I have seen in a long time,'' Obey said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., the chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, who has worked hard but unsuccessfully
this year to keep the spending bills from being mired in politics,
said, ``Sometimes I wish that this were fiction, but it is not.''
</P>
<P>
   The continuing resolution passed the House by a 421-2 vote and
immediately went to the Senate, which approved it, 98-1, after an
equally desultory debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the years I've been here,'' said Senate Minority Leader
Tom Daschle, ``I don't recall a time when there's been greater
appropriations disarray than there is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Republican Congress and the White House must spend the
three weeks covered by the continuing resolution in the political
equivalent of hand-to-hand combat, fighting over how to spend
roughly half a trillion dollars of public money.
</P>
<P>
   As the continuing resolution was sent to Clinton, senior
Republicans in the House and Senate sought ways to find billions of
dollars to finance spending bills without tapping into Social
Security money.
</P>
<P>
   They still plan to take back $3 billion in welfare money from
the states, even though the nation's 50 governors _ 31 of whom are
Republicans _ oppose the idea and say Republican leaders promised
them this year that they would not touch the money. ``Congress is
breaking the commitment it made,'' the National Governors'
Association said on Tuesday in a letter to House leaders.
</P>
<P>
   And House Majority Leader Dick Armey said Congress could recoup
$8 billion by changing the way it pays out the earned-income tax
credit. He said the money could be saved by meting out this federal
tax break for working-class wage-earners in monthly payments
instead of in an annual lump sum.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Senate and House negotiators wrangled over a Pentagon
spending bill of nearly $270 billion, with Lott working to convince
the House to finance construction of a $1.5 billion ship in his
home state.
</P>
<P>
   Congress sent a measure financing energy and water projects to
the White House, completing work on the fifth of its 13 spending
bills this year. And Clinton issued the first of seven vetoes he
and his advisers have threatened against those bills, rejecting a
measure financing federal operations in the District of Columbia,
saying Republican amendments to the bill violated the principle of
home rule for the capital. &QL;

FOUNDRY NETWORKS SHARES UP SIXFOLD IN 1ST DAY OF TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of Foundry Networks Inc., a three-year-old designer of
devices to manage Internet traffic, rose more than sixfold Tuesday
in their first day of trading, the second-sharpest rise ever for a
new stock.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had predicted a scorching debut for Foundry. The
company is in a fast-growing market that has been extremely
lucrative for investors and, unlike most new Internet businesses,
is already profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the gains were stunning, giving the company a market
capitalization of $8.7 billion. Foundry's shares closed at $156.25,
up $131.25 from the offering price of $25. Just over 5 million
shares were offered, and trading volume topped 12 million on
NASDAQ. The shares peaked at $166.56 in mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The only initial offering to have outpaced that 525 percent gain
was the one of theglobe.com, whose stock jumped 606 percent from a
$9 opening to $63.50 on its first day of trading in November.
Foundry's arrival was more impressive to some analysts because its
initial price was relatively high, with the price set at $25 by the
underwriter, Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the day traders and momentum players are focusing on
it,'' said Mark Basham, Standard &AMP; Poor's new issue stock analyst.
Basham had recommended the offering to investors, predicting that
it would ``double or triple'' on the first day.
</P>
<P>
   Foundry, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., was founded by veterans of
Centillion Networks Inc., a maker of local area network switches
that was sold to Bay Networks in 1995. Bobby Johnson, the chief
executive, president and chairman, holds 21.7 percent of the stock,
worth about $1.89 billion, after the offering, and directors and
officers as a group have 49 percent of the shares.
</P>
<P>
   Crosspoint Venture Partners of Woodside, Calif., is the leading
venture firm backing the company, with a 16.1 percent stake now
valued at $12.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Foundry is the latest public offering from a string of young
companies that aim to make Internet business more efficient. Its
major customers include America Online, Hewlett-Packard (which
distributes Foundry products under its own name) and Mitsui.
</P>
<P>
   Foundry's data-switching products work like traffic cops on the
increasingly complicated computer networks used for various
business tasks, especially on the Internet. By parceling out
demands for information efficiently to the many servers that can
fulfill them, they allow businesses to produce more sophisticated
applications, like video and live chat rooms, more quickly for more
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for such services is rising so rapidly that analysts like
Basham project Foundry's revenues, which were just $17 million last
year, will top $110 million this year and double the next year. For
the first six months of the year, the company had net income of
$3.27 million on $39.5 million in revenues. But Foundry hardly has
the field to itself. It must compete with established giants like
Cisco Systems, 3Com and Nortel Networks, along with many start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Some start-ups have been enormously popular with investors
despite their lack of profits. Juniper Networks, which went public
in June at $34, jumped to $98.88 on its first day and ended Tuesday
at $197.25.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Alteon Websystems rose from an initial price of
$19 to $74.94 on its first day of trading last Thursday. It closed
Tuesday at $93.25, down $18.81 in a correction that underscored the
volatility of the new issues. Analysts said Foundry could also
bounce violently in the coming days, but the overall message was
clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet networkers are very hot,'' said Peony Kao, an analyst
with Renaissance Capital Corp., a Greenwich, Conn., research firm
for institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   Basham said it was hard to justify Foundry's valuation at the
end of Tuesday's trading but that investors need not rush to take
profits since insiders are barred from selling their shares, which
amount to 90 percent of the outstanding stock, for six months. The
short supply of shares could send Foundry's stock still higher in
the near term, he advised.

CLINTONS NOT IN TOWN YET, BUT PROTESTERS ON THEIR WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. _ There goes the neighborhood. President and his
wife, Hillary, have not even closed the deal on their house here,
and already the first protest march is scheduled for Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   In a plan that has both bewildered and annoyed residents here,
representatives from Westpac, a White Plains group that describes
itself as ``an organization working for peace, social justice and
the environment,'' plans to hold a vigil in front of the Clintons'
future home to protest mass killings in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the town of New Castle, which includes this hamlet,
said that they had expected demonstrations after the Clintons had
moved in, but were perplexed about the timing of the event on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are they marching in front of the Weisbergs' house?''
Clinton Smith, the Town Supervisor, said, referring to Dr. Jeffrey
Weisberg and his wife, Cheryl, the current owners of the $1.7
million Dutch Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of pitiful,'' Smith said. ``They're protesting in
front of a private residence that has only a tangential
relationship to the president, and they're protesting about a
condition that now is being addressed, with U.N. peace-keeping
forces going into East Timor.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jacobs, Westpac's director, said that he was confident the
Clintons would hear about the protest, even though they do not yet
live at the house. He added that he expected 35 to 50 demonstrators
clad in black clothing and carrying candles to march from a
supermarket in town, down a winding state road and onto Old House
Lane to the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very intentionally chosen the most respectful and
quiet form of protest,'' he said, ``without any yelling or hoopla,
in order to disturb the residents of Chappaqua and the soon-to-be
neighbors of President Clinton as little as possible. But we feel
the importance of this message outweighs the inconvenience of the
people of Chappaqua.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that Westpac applied for a permit, which was granted.
But he said it was wrongheaded for protesters to march in the dark
wearing black. There are no sidewalks on Route 117, which was
closed Tuesday for culvert repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Mr. Jacobs wants his message to be heard,'' Smith said.
``I'm sure it will be heard by Dr. and Mrs. Weisberg and the other
residents of Old House Lane and the people who use Route 117. But
if he wants to send a message to the White House, I think Western
Union might be more appropriate.''

DONALD G. SANDERS DIES AT 69; BROUGHT NIXON TAPING TO LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald G. Sanders, a former Senate lawyer who uncovered the
White House tapes that led to President Richard M. Nixon's
resignation, died on Sunday at a hospital in Columbia, Mo. He was
69.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who lived in Columbia, died of cancer, said his wife,
Dolores.
</P>
<P>
   A former FBI agent, Sanders was a Republican staff lawyer for
the Senate committee investigating the Watergate break-in when he
brought to light ``the smoking gun'' that eventually pointed to
Nixon's complicity in a cover-up of the break-in.
</P>
<P>
   It was during a closed-door preliminary interrogation that
Sanders' curiosity was aroused by seemingly apprehensive answers
from Alexander P. Butterfield, Nixon's former appointments
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders dug deeper and asked if it were possible that some sort
of recording system had been used in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfield answered, ``I wish you hadn't asked that question,
but, yes, there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders then hurried to tell Fred D. Thompson, the lead minority
counsel who is now a Republican senator from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both knew then it was important,'' Sanders recalled in a
1997 interview.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in nationally televised hearings, Thompson asked
Butterfield about the recording system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was actually Don who discovered the existence of the White
House taping system, but he was too unassuming to ever mention
it,'' Thompson said on Monday in an interview with The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders had returned to his home state in the 1980s after more
than two decades of federal government service as a lawyer for
congressional committees, an FBI agent and an assistant secretary
of defense under President Gerald R. Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Gilbert Sanders was born on April 26, 1930, in St. Louis.
He graduated from the law school of the University of Missouri and
then spent two years in the Marines. From 1956 to 1959, he was city
attorney for Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   From 1959 to 1969, Sanders worked for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he started working as a lawyer for congressional
committees.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to Missouri, Sanders served as a commissioner in
Boone County in 1989 and 1990, but he did not seek re-election. He
had a private law practice in Columbia until his death.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Sanders, while battling cancer, tried to start a
national campaign to draft Thompson for the 2000 Republican
presidential nomination, but Thompson declined to enter the race.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Sanders is survived by two sons,
Michael, of Dallas, and Matthew, of Monrovia, Calif.; a daughter,
Deborah Sanders, of Arlington, Va., and his mother, Ann Sanders of
Columbia.

BUSH VISITS PHOENIX, GETS RHODES', HULL'S ENDORSEMENT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - George W. Bush swept into town Sept. 28 to stake
claims on Arizo na's political past and present, winning key
endorsements from former U.S. House Minority Leader John Rhodes and
Gov. Jane Hull.
</P>
<P>
   The venerable Rhodes, the last in a line of state political
giants that included the late Barry Goldwater and Morris Udall, all
but dismissed the candidacy of Arizona's Sen. John McCain, saying
he prefers Bush because McCain cannot be elected.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes' comments echoed those of retiring New York Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, who startled Democrats last week when he en
dorsed Bill Bradley after saying Vice President Al Gore could not
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no substitute for vic tory in politics. The number
two is also last. The campaign which Governor Bush is running is a
winning campaign. . . . Senator Mc Cain would be a good candidate
for anything except the presidency,'' Rhodes said of the man who
took his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives when he retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wanted to run for some thing else _ I have long
supported him, and I probably always would. But not at this time,''
Rhodes added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was honored to receive the endorsements and vowed
to wage an active campaign led by Hull in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got advice for anyone who's running for president: Make
sure you get the governor on your side, particularly if you've got
a governor with a record of accom plishment and a governor as
beloved by the people as Governor Hull,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm coming a lot to Ari zona. . . . This is a state that is
going to have a contested primary. I look forward to coming to
compete. I know I've got a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   After the long buildup over the past week, Hull's endorsement
was something of an anticlimax. She sidestepped questions on
exactly why she picked Bush over McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The governor carefully praised McCain as a great senator and a
hero.
</P>
<P>
   Then she said of Bush, ``I'm supporting a gentleman who I think
is an extremely good governor, someone who I think has vision for
the future, and I believe has the capability of handling any
problem that comes his way.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Hull and Bush took pains to say the event had been planned
for months and was not an attempt to ambush McCain as he traveled
the country for his presidential an nouncement tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been on my calendar for a long time. Never was there
any attempt to try to embarrass my friend. . . . He's a good man,''
Bush said in an interview. ``I've known him for a long time _ I
actually came in and campaigned for him. This was more coincidental
than planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes' comments on McCain prompted questions about whether
McCain would make a good vice president. Bush declined to answer,
saying it was ``presumptuous'' for someone who hadn't won the nomi
nation to talk about the GOP ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also was in town to attend a $250,000 fund-raiser that was
ex pected to be attended by 300 people, including Hull, Rhodes,
golfer Tom Lehman, and Arizona businessmen Jim Click and Karl
Eller.
</P>
<P>
   A previous event for the Texas governor in Phoenix raised
$280,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, accompanied by his wife, Laura, seemed to enjoy himself
all day, schmoozing up reporters, vot ers, and just about anybody
he ran into.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Rhodes' house in Mesa, a neighbor shouted across the
street to Bush, asking for a picture. He obliged, delighting Doreen
Karr.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best-looking thing I've seen in a long time,'' Karr
said, adding that she told Bush the same thing. ``I think they'll
vote him in on his looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the Bushes spent the noon hour lunching with Hull and her
husband, Terry, at Tom's Tavern in downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The two governors were seated in the restaurant's ``Governor's
Cor ner,'' which features a prominent picture of Hull and a
not-so-promi nent photo of Hull's predecessor, Fife Symington.
</P>
<P>
   After wolfing down a cheese burger, Bush worked the crowd,
shaking hands and talking baseball with restaurant patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Among those dropping by was Grant Woods, KFYI-AM talk show host
and former state attorney general. Woods, a former staff member of
McCain, said he is supporting Bush and Elizabeth Dole in the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really an impressive guy,'' Woods said of Bush. ``I think
there's a reason why he's winning in Arizona, and there's a reason
why he's winning everywhere else, be cause he's got the right stuff
for the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods lauded Hull for having the political courage to endorse
Bush, though most prominent Arizona Republicans have lined up
behind McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Woods noted that he was in a similar position in 1996, when he
was pressured to endorse Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas for the
Republican nomination, but instead backed the eventual nominee, Bob
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about some Mickey Mouse thing,'' Woods said.
``We're talking about who's going to be president of the United
States. I think it's appropriate that you make your own mind up on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he doubts McCain will even survive until the Arizona
primary, which is preceded by the Iowa Caucus and primaries in New
Hampshire and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question about John Mc Cain is: Will he get to Arizona?,''
Woods said. ``He might. But he probably won't. . . . I think
there's a reasonable chance that he won't get here. Bush will be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   After lunch, Bush visited the Thomas J. Pappas Elementary School
for the homeless in down town Phoenix. He was greeted by a
welcoming committee of students, then toured the school.
</P>
<P>
   Students asked Bush questions during an appearance on the
school's in-house ``radio station,'' which was piped into the
cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   The questions were not softballs. The students asked about gun
con trol, education policy and other controversial topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you plan to stop abortions,'' one student asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, to remind people that they should abstain
from sex until they're married,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also read a story, The Very Hungry Caterpillar, to a group
of kindergartners, who kept yelling that he would soon turn into a
butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Bush said, ``you're skip ping ahead.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE MUSEUM'S COURAGEOUS STAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 29:
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Museum of Art announced yesterday that it will
stand by its plans to open the exhibition called ``Sensation.'' It
also began litigation to prevent Mayor Rudolph Giuliani from
fulfilling his threat to withhold financing and possibly take over
the museum board. This is unequivocally the right action, one that
deserves the support of all of New York's cultural institutions.
The mayor's retaliatory announcement that the city will immediately
end its subsidy of the museum is an authoritarian overreaction that
deserves a swift hearing and repudiation by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the heads of many of New York City's most important
cultural institutions, public and private, have also released a
joint letter to Giuliani. The letter, which ``respectfully'' urges
the mayor to reconsider his threat, is signed by people whose
respect, in this instance, seems partly forced by the financial
hammer the mayor wields and by the aggressive personality that
leads them to believe he might use it, on the Brooklyn Museum if
not necessarily on their own institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The joint letter makes all the right points. The mayor's
threatened actions, including taking over the board of the Brooklyn
Museum, would indeed be a dangerous precedent. Even a mayor who is
not busy playing constituent politics in a Senate race, the way
Giuliani is, might find it tempting to intervene in cultural policy
from time to time. But one of the cardinal realities of New York
City is that this is a place where artistic freedom thrives, where
cultural experimentation and transgression are not threats to
civility but part of the texture and meaning of daily life. The
letter to the mayor speaks of the chilling effect his actions
against the Brooklyn Museum might have. That is an understatement.
A threat as blunt and unreasoned as the one the mayor has leveled
at the Brooklyn Museum promises to begin a new Ice Age in New
York's cultural affairs, at least until Giuliani leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   The museum directors who have signed the joint letter have made
a politic appeal to Giuliani. It was not the forum in which to
lecture him on the nature of artistic freedom and the subtleties of
public financing of the arts. But no matter how you assess the art
in ``Sensation'' or the motives of the Brooklyn Museum or even the
fatigue that the thought of another skirmish in the culture war
engenders _ a rock-hard principle remains. Public financing of the
arts cannot be a pretext for government censorship, not on behalf
of Roman Catholics or anyone else. The Brooklyn Museum and its
lawyer, Floyd Abrams, have found a fittingly aggressive way to make
this point in the face of Giuliani's unremitting attack. Their suit
argues that no one can be punished for exercising First Amendment
rights. The courts should respond by affirming that those rights
belong to the museum and the people of New York no matter how
deeply the mayor is mired in constitutional error.

GM AGREES TO 4-YEAR CONTRACT WITH UAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The General Motors Corp. and the United Automobile
Workers union reached agreement on a new, four-year labor contract
late Tuesday night that would give the company's 143,200 factory
workers annual raises of 3 percent plus adjustments for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The union and the company jointly announced the agreement, but
declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is significant for workers, of course, because of the
hefty raises. But it is also notable because it might signal that
GM has turned the corner in its previously frosty relations with
the union. The agreement came without a strike, and without the
customary saber-rattling from a frustrated union struggling to get
the company's attention at top levels. Last year, GM lost $2
billion because of a 54-day strike, its 17th strike since 1993.
This year, both the company and the union seemed eager to avoid a
repeat of the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that GM is trying much harder to work with the
union,'' said John A. Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
``GM's position reflects a genuine desire to pursue a path of
cooperation rather than confrontation and an unwillingness to take
the market share loss that would come with a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement comes as the auto industry is selling vehicles
nearly as fast as it can build them and earning huge profits, which
it does not want to interrupt.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the GM pact mirror those negotiated by the
DaimlerChrysler Corp., which reached agreement with the union Sept.
16. The union said Monday that DaimlerChrysler workers approved the
agreement by a margin of 86 percent. Later this month, GM workers
are expected to vote to ratify the contract language the union and
the company settled on Tuesday night, which, like the
DaimlerChrysler agreement, also provides for a $1,350 signing
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an expensive contract, but given the fact that the
companies are making record sales and earnings and have a strong
cash flow, it is hard for them to plead poverty,'' said David B.
Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen P. Yokich, the union president, said last week that this
year's labor contracts would allow workers to share in the
prosperity of their companies, ``It is our turn now that things are
good,'' he said after briefing local union leaders on the deal
reached with DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good contract,'' he said of that agreement, which
has the same principal terms as the one reached with General Motors
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yokich personally negotiated with GM's chairman, John F. Smith
Jr., during the last three days to reach the deal, company
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The union is expected to turn its attention later this week to
the Ford Motor Co. Three-year labor agreements at the three
companies expired Sept. 14, but have been extended as the union
negotiations continue. The new, four-year contracts cover 400,000
factory workers at the three companies.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is likely to make a similar deal with the union, but
negotiations may not go as smoothly as they have at DaimlerChrysler
and GM. The reason is that workers building auto parts at Ford's
Visteon subsidiary are nervous that their jobs and wages will be
less secure if Ford follows through on its plans to sell Visteon.
</P>
<P>
   According to the union, DaimlerChrysler agreed to language in
the contract barring sales or spinoffs of assets, which had little
impact on DaimlerChrysler because it had no immediate plans to sell
chunks of the company. But because the union typically reaches
agreement with one company, then forces the others to accept the
same terms, the clause may make it more difficult, or more
expensive, for Ford to reach a deal with the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strong anti-spinoff language in the DaimlerChrysler
contract is a real problem,'' Healy said. ``I don't know how they
are going to solve it.''
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is that the union will agree to allow Ford to
sell Visteon provided it follows the example of General Motors,
which spun off its Delphi auto parts division to shareholders in
May. The terms of the new GM contract apply to Delphi's 48,000
workers, according to the announcement Tuesday that the union had
reached a deal with GM.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to at least temporarily put its past antagonistic labor
relations behind, GM last year put Gary L. Cowger in charge of
negotiations as GM's group vice president for labor relations.
Cowger is a former factory manager with excellent union contacts
who was running GM's German operations at the time.
</P>
<P>
   GM's president, G. Richard Wagoner Jr., and its senior vice
president for North American manufacturing, Donald E. Hackworth,
handled much of last summer's negotiations with the UAW but did not
get along well with union leaders. Hackworth in particular ended up
on poor terms with the union, mainly because he strongly criticized
union leaders in several voice mail messages that he recorded and
put on a toll-free number for GM employees to call. Union leaders
also found that they tended to be considerably older and had little
in common with Wagoner, who is only 46.
</P>
<P>
   Sean McAlinden, an auto industry labor economics expert at the
University of Michigan, said that GM's personnel change had
improved matters. ``The important thing at GM was the personalities
there changed from Wagoner and Hackworth to Cowger, and that made
the difference,'' he said.

GOLD PRICE RISES $28.20, ITS HIGHEST IN ABOUT 2 DECADES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The price of gold surged $28.20, or 9 percent, to $308.10 an
ounce Tuesday, the biggest one-day rally in almost two decades.
Since last Tuesday, the price of gold has jumped $53.10, or 20.8
percent, wiping out all the losses for this year, and it is now the
highest it has been since April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's rally followed a $14 jump in the price Monday after 15
European central banks said Sunday that they would limit their
sales of gold to 400 tons a year for the next five years. That
pledge removed the fear that central bank gold sales would swamp
the market, pushing the price lower.
</P>
<P>
   The central banks also said they would limit their leasing of
gold. Borrowed gold is needed by speculators to bet on price
declines and by producers to sell gold now to lock in prices.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's buying, according to analysts, was fueled by
speculators who had bet that the price of gold would continue to
fall and by producers who are now waiting to see where the price
will settle.
</P>
<P>
   The speculators, known as short sellers, borrowed gold and sold
it. If the price declined, they could buy it back at the lower
price, return the borrowed gold and profit on the difference
between the two prices. But with the price of gold rising rapidly
they had to buy back gold as quickly as possible to limit their
losses. This kind of panic buying often pushes markets higher
rapidly and then peters out.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, producers who had been selling borrowed gold
to lock in prices against future production seem to be standing on
the sidelines. Although they were not buying, the absence of their
selling removed a barrier to the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Ward, the mining analyst at Lehman Brothers, said the
investors who thought the price had moved too high too fast were
also unwilling to bet against it because the cost of borrowing the
gold needed for such a short sell is so high. Tuesday, short-term
leasing rates for gold were 5 percent, Ward said, well above the
average of just of 1 percent since 1992, according to Gold Fields
Mineral Services, a London-based precious metals research firm.
``It is not that attractive for shorts to re-establish their
positions at this level,'' Ward said, because the borrowing rate
for gold is so high.
</P>
<P>
   Ward also said that a rising seasonal demand for jewelry would
give an added impetus to the gold price now.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how much further this rally can go. In the
longer term, Ward said he did not think the price could stay above
$300 an ounce because demand for jewelry would drop off and more
gold mines would keep producing rather than shutting down. Both
moves, he said, would add to the overall supply of gold and push
the price lower.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the limit on gold sales agreed to by the 15 central
banks actually would allow for more sales than he had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   While the rally in gold pushed up many gold mining stocks, some
fell Tuesday. Barrick Gold Corp. slipped 25 cents, to $23.875,
after jumping $3.9375 on Monday.

BRADLEY OFFERS SWEEPING HEATH CARE PLAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Presidential hopeful Bill Bradley came to the San
Fernando Valley on Tuesday to unveil what he admits is a costly,
$65 billion plan that would guarantee health care for every
American, part of his ``big ideas'' approach in seeking the
Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The former U.S. senator from New Jersey said every American has
a right to good health care from birth through their senior years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of my father, who had health problems, when I think
about health care because I believe that every American deserves
what my father got _ the helping hands to a productive life,''
Bradley said to about 500 students and supporters inside an
assembly hall at Los Angeles Valley College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good health is a blessing, not a guarantee. But good health
care is a right, and it is up to us to ensure that right to every
American.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is seeking the nomination against Vice President Al
Gore, who has proposed a more modest plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's plan would allow Americans to enroll in the same
coverage provided members of Congress and federal employees. There
would be subsidies for the poor and tax breaks for all Americans
who pay insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Parents would be required to enroll children in their
employee-provided health plans or a federally approved system of
private health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare would be expanded to provide the elderly with uncapped
prescription drug benefits for chronic and catastrophic illnesses,
and the plan provides a system of integrated medical and social
services to reduce nursing home admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley acknowledged the high cost but contended no new taxes
would be needed. He said it could be paid for from federal budget
surpluses without touching Social Security surpluses, and through
savings on costs for unnecessary care, redundant tests and
excessive administration costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to America's health, this is not the time to be
timid. It requires bold action and a national commitment from the
president on down to make certain that every American has what
should be an American birthright.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign countered that Bradley's plan is too costly and
won't leave funding for the Medicare Trust Fund or other
investments, such as education and reducing the national debt. The
Gore campaign also said Bradley's plan would create a new federal
bureaucracy and could give employers an incentive to drop current
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed giving states more money to provide health
coverage for children. Children in families earning up to 250
percent of poverty-level income would qualify for federally
supported state coverage, up from 200 percent now. Families earning
more and lacking insurance could buy into the state program. There
is no cost estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the leading Republican candidate, has
called for expanding medical savings accounts and strengthening tax
incentives to small businesses that provide health care to
employees. Another possible change is limiting Medicare benefits
for seniors with higher incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Those reforms don't go far enough for Bradley, who said the 45
million uninsured Americans shouldn't have to face illness alone.
``The time has come to right these wrongs in our health care
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also said, in a reference to Gore's plan, that ``it is
irresponsible to commit to new programs without also laying the
costs before the public so that we can decide together how to pay
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   By unveiling such a critical issue in Los Angeles, Bradley
demonstrated how important California is in his bid to upset Gore
for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the Valley College crowd who said they weren't Bradley
supporters indicated he could do well in California because he
doesn't seem like a politician making promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems real down to earth. He seems to have real
solutions,'' said Jeremy Oberstein, a freshman. ``He made us feel
he wasn't a politician on a stage, but someone talking to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandra Mundon, a freshman from nearby Sherman Oaks, said,
``I've had lots of health problems the past few years and I liked
what he said about the patients being first. Politicians, when they
speak, it's really rare that someone my age can connect with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's appearance opened a four-day swing through the state.
He is one of several candidates, including Republicans Bush, Steve
Forbes and Elizabeth Dole, in California this week.

   Mathematically, the Mets live. But after the first inning at
Shea Stadium, they would be better off dead. Anyone with the
slightest touch of compassion could see that.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who are already in the playoffs, were playing for
nothing more than home-field advantage, but their 9-3 victory was
no contest between their playoff-hardened veteran pitcher and the
Mets' playoff-hardened veteran pitcher. The first inning told the
whole tale. Tom Glavine emerged from it unscathed despite a Mets'
threat; Hershiser did not survive it.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, in fact, experienced his briefest start of his
16-year career. In 458 previous regular-season starts and 18 in
post-season games, he had never failed to get at least three outs.
In his 477th start, the 41-year-old right-hander faced seven
batters and secured only one _ count it, one _ out. He didn't
choke, but boy, did he get beat.
</P>
<P>
   Even the out figured in the four runs the Braves scored in a
hurry. It was Brian Jordan's fly ball to short left field that
enabled Chipper Jones to tag up and score from third base. By
running despite the short distance the ball traveled, Jones showed
disdain for Rickey Henderson's left arm. Even with his recent
questionable base running, Henderson might have beaten the ball to
home plate if he had raced it.
</P>
<P>
   If anything can be said in Hershiser's behalf, it is that none
of the five hits he allowed was crushed; none was even hit hard.
But the balls weren't hit at any of the Mets' fine defensive
players. All eluded them. That is how the Braves scored four runs.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, who pitched creditably (three runs in seven innings)
in the middle game of the disastrous three-game series in Atlanta
last week, instantly created trouble for himself. With his third
pitch of the game, Hershiser plunked Gerald Williams, the Braves'
leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Division championship in hand, Cox was not going to sit back and
play this one leisurely. He sent that signal to the Mets by calling
for a hit and run, which Bret Boone executed beautifully, bouncing
a single to right field as Williams raced to third.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up the Destroyer, a k a Chipper Jones. If any
player has ever displayed most valuable player credentials any more
emphatically, his name doesn't come to mind. In three victories
over the Mets, Jones hit four home runs and drove in seven runs
with them, one more run than the Mets scored in the series.
</P>
<P>
   The debate that arose from the ashes of the Mets' flameout in
Atlanta was whether or not the Mets should have walked Jones rather
than toss up pitches that he could whack out of the park. Dave
Wallace, the Mets' pitching coach, said that strategy would have to
be considered for this series.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets passed up the first opportunity they had to make
such a bold move. Instead of walking Jones and loading the bases,
Hershiser pitched to him and Jones looped a single to right-center
field, driving in the first run.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko followed with a single to left field that sent Boone
home with the second run and Jones to third, from where he scored
on Jordan's pop-up to left. Successive singles by Andruw Jones and
Greg Myers, the fourth and fifth hits of the inning, loaded the
bases, and one pitch later, a ball to Jose Hernandez, Hershiser was
gone. Most likely for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Octavio Dotel's first relief pitch was a wild pitch that enabled
Klesko to score the fourth run, and the Mets would never catch up.
</P>
<P>
   They tried in their half of the first inning. Henderson reached
first when Boone booted his bouncer, and Shawon Dunston bunted for
a single. But unlike Hershiser, the talented Glavine was able to
extricate himself from trouble.
</P>
<P>
   He threw a third strike past John Olerud, retired Mike Piazza on
a fly ball to left and struck out Edgardo Alfonzo. Glavine
dispatched the three batters so efficiently it was as if the threat
never existed.
</P>
<P>
   In the next six innings, Glavine gave the Mets not much more. A
pair of harmless singles in the third inning gave the Mets the only
other base runners they managed until Dunston led off the sixth
with a double and came around on a pair of groundouts for the only
run against Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of seven days, the Mets learned that reports of
Glavine's demise were premature. He pitched against them twice and
allowed them only three runs in 14 innings. Hershiser's quick
demise, on the other hand, will help send the Mets home for the
winter prematurely.

ANNELI CAHN LAX, 77, A LEADER IN THE PUBLISHING OF MATHEMATICS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anneli Cahn Lax, a professor and editor who was a
leader in the publishing of mathematical literature, died on Friday
at her home in Manhattan. She was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Anneli Lax had pancreatic cancer, said her husband, Peter Lax.
</P>
<P>
   She retired in 1992 from New York University, where she had been
a professor for 31 years after holding other posts there for 18
years.
</P>
<P>
   In her dissertation at NYU and in later publications, she made
significant contributions to the theory of hyperbolic equations, a
complex mathematical theory about aspects of the behavior of many
kinds of waves.
</P>
<P>
   She may be best known, however, for her contributions to the
understanding of mathematics by both students and lay people,
especially as the editor of the Mathematical Association of
America's New Mathematical Library Series.
</P>
<P>
   The series, started in 1961, included 36 published volumes by
1995. It was planned, by Lax and others, to make mathematics
accessible to the general reader without stinting on technical
accuracy. Its first two books, ``Numbers: Rational and Irrational''
by Ivan Niven and ``What Is Calculus About?'' by W.W. Sawyer, are
still in print after a third of a century.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lax ``led the way in changing mathematical
pedagogy, in exploring the connections of mathematics to the larger
curriculum, in understanding the interplay between language and
mathematics,'' Joanne V. Creighton, president of Mount Holyoke
College, said in awarding her an honorary degree in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Creighton said Lax's experiences in mathematics and family life
had endowed her with a special awareness of the challenges
confronting young women interested in mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   Lax was a longtime active member of the New York Academy of
Sciences and was instrumental in shaping its program of science
education for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a misconception among people and schoolchildren about
the nature of mathematics,'' she said in a 1979 interview. ``They
consider it a matter of rules and regulations instead of
thinking.'' The pressure, she said, was for pupils to come up with
the right answer quickly, without time to analyze.
</P>
<P>
   The honors she won included an award for ``distinguished service
to mathematics'' from the mathematical association.
</P>
<P>
   Lax was born in Kattowitz, Germany. She and her family fled
Hitler's Germany in 1935 and settled in New York. She received a
bachelor's degree in 1942 from Adelphi College and her doctorate in
1956.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her husband of 51 years, who is also a professor of
mathematics at NYU, she is survived by a son, Dr. James D. Lax of
Manhattan, and three grandsons.

TOLEDO PICKS FIVE FAB FROSH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Twelve members of UCLA's 18-man freshman class are
sitting out the season as redshirts. Asked recently to name the
best of the dozen, coach Bob Toledo mentioned five:
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; !off! &LR; Dave and Mat(cq) Ball, the identical twins from
Dixon, Calif. Dave plays defensive end, Mat plays linebacker, and
unlike the Webb twins, both have an attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to contribute quite a bit,'' Toledo said.
``They're going to be leaders. They're very athletic and they have
a mean streak.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; !off! &LR; Defensive tackle Rodney Leisle, a 300-pounder from
Bakersfield who missed the start of training camp with a broken
foot. The Bruins hope he'll evolve into a dependable run stopper at
what has traditionally been their weakest position.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he hadn't been hurt at the start, he might have been an
impact guy,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; !off! &LR; Shane Lehmann, a 285-pound guard from Corona.
Talent isn't the reason freshman Bryce Bohlander plays while
Lehmann sits. It's a matter of need. The Bruins were short one
tackle (Bohlander's position) early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; !off! &LR; Jerry Owens, a 180-pound receiver from Hart High.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really pleased with him,'' Toledo said. ``He has
excellent hands and good speed. He's going to be a good receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!You look marvelous:!off! The Bruins want quarterback Cory
Paus to wear a sternum jacket under his shoulder pads to protect
his bruised ribs, but he's resisting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a bulletproof vest,'' Paus said. ``And it looks
funny. If you don't feel like you look good, you don't play good.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Arizona State update:!off! Sun Devils quarterback Ryan
Kealy also has bruised ribs and is questionable for Saturday's
game. He suffered the injury against Cal and did not finish the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't know until later in the week,'' ASU coach Bruce Snyder
said of Kealy's availability.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!The highs and lows:!off! One of the most common football
injuries is the high ankle sprain. It's considered more serious
than low sprains and has slowed receiver Danny Farmer, tailback
DeShaun Foster and guard Mike Saffer this season.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``high sprain'' is a relatively new term, UCLA head
athletic trainer Geoff Schaadt said it's not a new injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) was 10 years
ago _ we just understand much better what we're dealing with,''
Schaadt said.
</P>
<P>
   A low sprain occurs when the ankle rolls inward and the outside
of the foot almost touches the ground. Athletes usually recover in
a few hours or days, depending on the severity.
</P>
<P>
   A high sprain occurs when the ankle rolls outward and the inside
of the foot hits the ground. This causes the fibula to separate
from the tibia _ the large, weight-bearing bone in the lower leg _
and damages the ligaments above the ankle bone. Players often need
weeks to recover from high sprains.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Injury update:!off! Foster (sprained ankle) did not
practice Tuesday and probably won't today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very iffy and if he doesn't practice (today), I'll
probably start Keith Brown,'' Toledo said. ``We'll be very lucky to
get him by game time.''
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Brian Poli-Dixon (broken wrist) might not require
surgery because the damaged bone has not been displaced. He'll wear
a cast for a month, then doctors will re-examine the break. At that
point, he'll either have surgery or spend another month in a cast.
</P>
<P>
   Of cornerback Jason Bell's injured right heel, Schaadt said:
``It's taking a lot longer (to heal) than I anticipated.''

EDITORIAL: SHORING UP THE VOLUNTEER ARMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 29:
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of two decades, the catchy advertising
jingle ``Be All That You Can Be,'' along with promises of
on-the-job training and money for higher education, helped the U.S.
Army meet its recruiting goals and gave the country a high-quality
volunteer force. But now the Army, along with other branches of the
armed services, is facing a serious recruiting gap that is forcing
it to rethink its hiring practices and marketing strategy. The
proposed changes in tactics outlined in a story in Monday's Times
seem like a good start on what is likely to be a long and difficult
effort to turn things around. As a collateral benefit, these
changes may help society as well.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Pentagon offer several reasons for the
declining lack of interest in military service. One is purely
statistical. The pool of young men and women between the ages of 18
and 22, the optimum age for recruits, has shrunk to about 21
million, down 5 million from the 1980 level. Meanwhile, a robust
economy has created abundant job opportunities for those who might
otherwise be interested in enlisting, while making it financially
feasible for more young people to attend college.
</P>
<P>
   There may also be more amorphous influences at work. Louis
Caldera, the secretary of the Army, notes that many of the parents
of the present generation of recruits came of age after the draft
ended in 1973, and thus have no tradition of military service to
pass along to their offspring. Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., who heads
the House subcommittee on military personnel, believes that the
armed forces have never codified their basic mission since the end
of the Cold War and, under President Clinton, have begun to
resemble an international fire brigade with poorly defined,
helter-skelter responsibilities that might best be left to regional
powers.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the numbers are not good. When the fiscal
year ends tomorrow, the Army will fall short of its goal for the
second year in a row, signing up 7,000 fewer enlistees than the
74,500 it needs to maintain its force at current levels. The Air
Force is expected to miss its target by a lesser amount and the
Navy will just squeak by. Only the Marine Corps has kept pace. Like
all the services, the Army has increased its advertising, raised
its ``signing bonuses'' and increased its contribution to a
recruit's post-military college tuition from $40,000 to $50,000.
The Army has also sent young soldiers back into their neighborhoods
to deliver pep talks to their civilian contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   These tactics make sense, but the most promising strategy may
lie, paradoxically, in the Pentagon's willingness to ease its
standards. Under present rules, 90 percent of the Army's recruits
must have at least a high school diploma. In recent years, however,
the Army has found that recruits with lesser academic credentials
like a general equivalency diploma _ GED for short _ have performed
just as well as those with high school degrees. Thus, just as the
Navy did last year, the Army is thinking of relaxing the 90 percent
requirement, allowing more GED students into its ranks. It is also
planning a pilot program that will pay 6,000 high school dropouts
to pursue a GED so they can qualify to join the active force or the
reserves. In a similar vein, the Army will try to sign up students
who have started college but dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the Army will increasingly be seeking its recruits
among dropouts of one sort or another, as long as they possess or
can be persuaded to obtain minimal credentials. This strategy could
yield a double benefit. It could not only help the Army deal with
its manpower problems but also give a new sense of direction to
many thousands of young people who might otherwise wind up on the
streets, unemployed or in dead-end service jobs.

WAIT PAYS OFF FOR LANDRIGAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Last spring, Charlie Landrigan was told he might
want to consider transferring to another school. This week, he's
USC's starting fullback.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently buried behind Brennan Ochs and Chad Pierson last May,
it was suggested to Landrigan by coaches he might want to look
elsewhere if he didn't like playing on the scout team. But
Landrigan said he never considered leaving USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just sat down and talked about my role,'' Landrigan said.
``I think they wanted to see if I was happy. Is (the scout team)
something I'd want or would I be happier somewhere else?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't look at it that way. I was optimistic about the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Landrigan's persistence paid off this week, when he will start
his first game at fullback after a good performance against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get used to things for two years and then thrust into a
new role,'' Landrigan said. ``I'm thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   __ A real comic: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward had a career-high
12 catches against Oregon but joked afterward that USC did better
when he wasn't the focal point of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they should keep taking me out of the offense, because
we were winning before,'' Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   Was Soward referring to the USC coaches or opposing teams?
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Line woes: Offensive line coach Steve Greatwood is among the
coaches exasperated over the penalties, especially after the line
committed nine against Oregon. So he has threatened to pull a
player out of a game if an infraction is committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as coaches right now are exhausted. We don't know what else
to do,'' Greatwood said. ``I just have to make a conscious effort
to come down on guys who get sloppy with their hands. We have
developed a reputation, whether it's earned or not. Other teams get
away with it. We don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Greatwood was also disappointed by the line's reaction to the
crowd noise at Autzen Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't keep our poise as well as I expected to,'' Greatwood
said. ``I'll take the blame for that.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Position changes: USC has moved sophomore Darryl Knight from
linebacker to tight end, and tight end Pat Swanson will no longer
play the position, so he can concentrate on long-snapping. He had
problems snapping against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are zeroing in on playing tight end, human nature
says you split your focus,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``We've
got to give the kicker the best chance to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Swanson caught two passes for 37 yards against Oregon, his first
receptions of his career. Scott Huber will be the blocking tight
end and Antoine Harris the pass-catching tight end in double-tight
end situations.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hayes doubtful: Wide receiver Windrell Hayes (sprained ankle)
remains doubtful this week. Offensive guard Donta Kendrick has a
sprained ankle, but it is not considered serious.
</P>
<P>
   __ Denmon examined: Center Eric Denmon has a nagging knee injury
that caused him to miss the second half against Oregon and had team
doctors mulling a magnetic resonance imaging test Tuesday night.
His status for the game is uncertain.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ There is more than the Western Conference
title at stake when the Los Angeles Galaxy plays host to Colorado
tonight at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy has tested its playoff mettle the past two games and
failed miserably. But every time Los Angeles has lost under Sigi
Schmid, the former UCLA coach has found a way to bring the team
back and stay away from a big slump.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Schmid has prepared for the MLS playoffs, which begin
in two weeks. He feels you can have one bad game, but you can't
have two consecutive, and certainly not three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I've said, it's been a long time since we lost two in a
row,'' Schid said. ``You look at any team in this league and they
go through a series of games where they're going to lose some. And
if you look at our team, we haven't had this type of stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   At least not for a while. The last time the Galaxy lost three in
a row, it fired its coach.
</P>
<P>
   Before back-to-back losses to Colorado and D.C. United, the
Galaxy hadn't dropped two consecutive since May. However, the most
recent defeats seem more troublesome because of the playoff
situation. Instead of leading the Western Conference by four or
eight points, the Galaxy leads the Rapids by a point _ and it's
only three and four points ahead of Dallas and Chicago,
respectively, with three games to play.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid, who hasn't been on the sidelines for the Galaxy's
playoff disasters, was asked why the team seems to sputter in games
that matter most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you read a Galaxy article with us going into the
playoffs, all people can think about is 1996,'' said Schmid,
referring to Los Angeles' 3-2 overtime loss to United in the
inaugural MLS championship. The Galaxy squandered a 2-0 second half
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nineteen-ninety-six was three years ago. Most of the players
that were there are not here now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we choked (this year)? No, because we're not in the
playoffs yet. If we play games like this in the playoffs, then
maybe we have choked a little bit.''

<P>
   Fifteen years after the court-supervised breakup of AT&AMP;T, a part
of the old Ma Bell stands a good chance of being allowed to offer
customers both long-distance and local service.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Corp., the nation's biggest local telephone
company, plans to ask federal regulators, perhaps as soon as
Wednesday, for permission to sell long-distance communications
services in New York state. Approval would make it the first Baby
Bell to enter the $80 billion long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission has rejected five previous
long-distance applications from other Bell companies, saying they
had not yet opened their local networks to competition, as required
by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. But many communications
executives, analysts and lawyers expect Bell Atlantic's imminent
New York application to be approved.
</P>
<P>
   For the 6.6 million New York households served by Bell Atlantic,
approval could mean one-stop shopping for local and long-distance
phone service for the first time since AT&AMP;T Corp.'s break-up in
1984. In addition to offering pricing plans competitive with those
of the established long-distance giants, Bell Atlantic could also
offer special deals like discounted pricing for local service to
consumers who sign up for the company's long-distance product. Bell
Atlantic's entry into the long-distance market could put additional
downward pressure on long-distance prices, which are already in a
cycle of decline.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC declined to comment. But John Nakahata, who was chief of
staff for the commission's chairman, William Kennard, until last
winter, said, ``I think that there's a sense at the commission that
it's getting close to being time to let a Bell into long
distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakahata added, ``Assuming they have the support of New York
regulators, I think they'll get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they say that Bell Atlantic does not deserve to win
long-distance entry, some of Bell Atlantic's potential
long-distance competitors, including AT&AMP;T, also say the petition
will probably pass muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd put the chances above 50-50,'' said Michael Morrissey,
vice president for government affairs at AT&AMP;T, which stands to lose
billions in revenue if the Baby Bells broadly enter the
long-distance market. ``The other applications had no real
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic's application would apply only to New York state,
whose $7 billion long-distance market is one of the nation's most
attractive for communications companies. But if the petition is
approved, New York will probably set a regulatory tone for much of
the rest of the nation, with other Bells in other states looking to
Bell Atlantic's New York experience for guidance on how to gain
access to the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on track for a filing this week,'' said James Cullen,
president and chief operating officer of Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   If Bell Atlantic wins long-distance approval, it would open a
vast new front in the brutal wars of marketing and technology that
have roiled the communications business since passage of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, a law that was intended to
eliminate many barriers among various communications sectors.
</P>
<P>
   The act set off a frantic dash among the nation's communications
giants to assemble comprehensive baskets of local, long-distance,
wireless and Internet services to be offered to consumers as
one-stop communications solutions, making it less likely that
consumers will divide service among several companies. In that
vein, AT&AMP;T Corp., the No. 1 long-distance carrier, has committed
more than $90 billion to enter local communications markets by
acquiring two big cable companies, Tele-Communications Inc. and
Mediaone Group Inc., and retooling its network to piggyback local
phone service and Internet access on TV cables.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, based in Philadelphia, acquired Nynex Corp. in
1997 and has since agreed to merge with GTE Corp. This month it
struck a deal with Vodafone Airtouch, Britain's largest wireless
concern, to combine their U.S. wireless operations and create the
nation's largest coast-to-coast network.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, none of the local Bells has won entry to the
long-distance market. Before that can happen, the FCC must certify
that a Bell has met a highly technical checklist included in the
1996 act to ensure that it has opened its local network to
competitors. Between the breakup of Ma Bell in 1984 and passage of
the act, the Bells were completely barred from the long-distance
market.

<P>
   In the eyes of many communications experts, Bell Atlantic's
strategy for winning long-distance approval has been more patient _
and potentially more effective _ than those of the other Bells.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, which acquired Nynex Corp. in 1997 and has since
agreed to merge with GTE Corp., has spent more than a year slogging
through a tough review by the New York Public Service Commission
and the Justice Department. In April 1998, Bell Atlantic struck a
deal under which the Public Service Commission and the Justice
Department would support Bell Atlantic's long-distance aspirations
in New York after the company had completed a set of network tests.
</P>
<P>
   But those tests took longer and uncovered more problems than
perhaps any of the parties had expected. At the time of the deal,
Bell Atlantic said it hoped to be in the long-distance market in
New York by the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other applicant to date has gone through the type of
testing that Bell Atlantic has done,'' said Nakahata, the former
FCC chief of staff who is now &UR;  &LR; a partner at the Washington law firm
of Harris, Wiltshire &AMP; Grannis. ``The fight will be over whether
the performance is good enough, but it is clear that the testing is
far beyond what anyone else has done.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear, however, whether the New York regulators are
satisfied. If they were to oppose the application, it would stand
almost no chance with the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   But after spending a year longer than expected meeting the
demands of New York regulators, it would be a big surprise if Bell
Atlantic had not received at least a tacit nod from the New York
commission to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the telecommunications law was passed, New York has seemed
like a natural candidate to be the first state to allow a Baby Bell
to offer long-distance service because so many competitive
local-exchange companies (known as CLECs and pronounced SEE-leks)
have made the state a target. Among others, MCI Worldcom Inc. has
signed up about 160,000 residential customers in New York, while
AT&AMP;T has about 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Bell Atlantic decided to do is strike deals _ deals with
the FCC, with the New York commission, with the CLECs,'' said Reed
Hundt, a former chairman of the FCC who is now a consultant for
McKinsey &AMP; Co. ``And this diplomatic strategy is going to get them
into long-distance in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York commission declined to comment. The FCC also
declined to comment, but people close to the commission
acknowledged that it would be under intense pressure to approve the
application to show that the telecommunications law is producing
competition almost four years after its passage. Some members of
Congress have criticized the commission for not moving more quickly
to approve long-distance applications.
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications Inc. is within weeks or months of applying
for long-distance in Texas, and people close to the commission
added that the FCC might prefer to give its first approval to Bell
Atlantic because the New York regulators have set a higher bar for
opening the incumbent's network than have the Texas regulators.
</P>
<P>
   After the application is filed, the commission will have 90 days
to review it. During that time, the lobbying battle will be
intense, with the long-distance giants doing their best to have the
petition denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a practical matter, Bell Atlantic isn't ready in New
York,'' said Jonathan Sallet, MCI Worldcom's chief policy counsel.
``At the current time, the facts show that the systems that have to
work don't yet work.''

EDITORIAL: POLITICAL CHANGE IN GERMANY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 29,
1999:
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few decades, Germany and its workers have
benefited from a generous social contract. High wages, short
working hours and ample health care, pensions and welfare payments
have not only allowed German workers to share fully in their
nation's prosperity, they have also strengthened German democracy.
But the world is changing, and Germany's social contract now
contributes to unemployment and stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of waffling, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has now
embraced economic reality and proposed some mild modifications in
Germany's welfare state. But his proposals have been attacked by
virtually every other political party in Germany, as well as by the
traditional wing of his own Social Democrats. Although the party
won a few important mayoral elections on Monday, it has been
walloped in a series of state and local elections, which further
hampers Schroeder's chances of passing reforms. To save his program
and the possibility of creating jobs, he will have to convince the
German people that their well-being depends in part on rewriting
the social contract.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's welfare state was designed when the country had very
low unemployment and higher birthrates than today. Now the
unemployment rate is over 10 percent, and fewer workers must
support more retirees _ and the ratio will worsen. In addition,
Germany has paid almost $100 billion a year for unification _ more
each year than the Marshall Plan would cost in today's dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's social benefits now add 40 percent to the cost of each
worker _ a killer in an economy where creating jobs must be the top
priority. In addition, one-quarter of Germany's budget is now spent
on debt. This cannot be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder is largely right to blame his predecessor. The
conservative Helmut Kohl preserved generous social benefits during
his 16 years in office. Before leaving, he did pass modest reforms
to reduce the growth of pensions, make it easier for companies to
dismiss workers and reduce sick leave. Schroeder reversed even
these tepid measures when he took power _ part of a squandered and
confusing honeymoon period.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's own changes so far, and his proposals for more,
hardly constitute an attack on workers. His government closed some
tax loopholes set up by Kohl for favored businesses and the
wealthy. It also raised taxes on gasoline, with the revenue going
to reduce taxes on workers and employers. The most attacked current
proposal would hold pension growth to the rate of inflation for two
years, instead of letting pensions rise with wages. Schroeder would
also cut the budget by $16 billion, and proposes reducing the
state's share of Germany's economy over time from 48 percent to 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even these small steps are alarming to many Germans, who worry
that their country is headed toward low wages and scant health
coverage. But that is not a realistic fear for Germany. Current
unemployment breeds resentment in the worse-off eastern states,
alienates youth and feeds radical movements. Germany needs many
changes to create jobs. These must include modest reductions in
labor costs and more fiscal responsibility. Schroeder has settled
on a wise course, and he must not waver.
