<HEADLINE> Israeli Settlement Policy Endangers Mideast Peace March: Egyptian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CAIRO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Tuesday warned of the
danger that Israel poses to the Middle East peace process by
continuing settlement expansion in the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Israel is continuing settlement activities in the occupied
Palestinian lands, a move which will be detrimental to the peace
talks between the Palestinians and Israel, Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa told reporters after a meeting between Egyptian
 President Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here earlier in the day for a short visit. He
focused his talks with Mubarak on Israel's settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
"The information aired by the Israeli side regarding halt to
its settlement activities totally contradicted with the reality,"
the Egyptian foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat presented some data in this regard involving the fact
that the Israeli government had published tenders for the building
of 7,000 new housing units in the West Bank in addition to other
units in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have been angered and frustrated by Israel's
settlement expansion. Most of the international community considers
 the Israeli settlement activities as illegal.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Federal Troops Press Ahead With Chechen Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Tuesday extended the
daily lull of its bombing of Grozny from six hours to eight to
allow civilians in the Chechen capital to flee as mop-up
operations continued in Shali, the fourth town in the breakaway
republic.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, federal forces kept up its artillery and aerial
raids at rebel positions in southern and eastern Chechnya Tuesday,
the Interfax news agency reported, citing a spokesman with the
Russian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Grozny has been brought under siege for several days, but
federal forces have refrained from staging a frontal storming of
the city to avoid heavy military and civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
However, there were unconfirmed reports that some advance units
of federal troops were already inside Grozny, and Russian military
headquarters in the North Caucasus said no task has been set for
the troops to drive rebels out of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Rebel leaders pin their hopes in the defense of Grozny on
foreign mercenaries and gangsters who have committed grave crimes,
Interfax quoted Russian military sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Numerous gangsters are reportedly trying to break away from the
city and flee into the southern mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
The rebels "keep ethnic Russian inhabitants of Grozny as
hostages and do not let out of the city those who are prepared to
surrender to federal units," a Defense Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
In Shali, which lies 20 kilometers southeast of Grozny, federal
"mop-up efforts have led to the arrest of 26 people suspected of
being Islamic militants and the discovery of arms and ammunition
depots, said Gennady Troshev, commander of a group involved in
Russia's Chechen campaign.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand militants remain in Grozny and most of them
are concentrated on the city's northwestern outskirts near the
Severny airport. They have mined western and southern approaches
to the city by laying highly toxic chemical substances and
preparing other explosives for detonation, Interfax reported,
citing military intelligence.
</P>
<P>
The current campaign was launched in September following
Chechen rebels' armed incursions into neighboring Daghestan and a
spate of terrorist bombings, also blamed on the rebels, that
killed about 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
As federal forces expand their control in Chechnya, the exodus
of refugees, initially numbering more than 260,000, has eased. So
far, some 43,000 of them have returned to their homes a spokesman
for the Russian Emergencies Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The supply of gas and power has been returning to the areas
liberated by federal forces. In addition, 57 schools and 10
hospitals have reopened.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Defense Ministry confirmed Tuesday
its loss of one Su- 25 attack plane and two helicopters over
Chechnya on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The pilot of the Su-25, who ejected before the crash, has been
rescued to safety, but the two helicopters were brought down by
Chechen rebels in the rescue operation. The crew of one of the
helicopters perished.

<HEADLINE> Iran Vows to Continue Efforts to Resolve Chechen Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday vowed to
continue its effort to resolve the Chechen crisis through
diplomatic means as Russian troops have reportedly captured parts
of the suburb of the Chechen capital of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The second batch of Iran's humanitarian relief materials can be
sent to the Chechen refugees as soon as the Russian government
gives approval, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing regret over the continuation of the current crisis in
 Chechnya, he said that the Muslim world believes there should be a
 peaceful solution to the Chechen crisis.
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops have controlled the northern suburb of
Grozny while reconnaissance units have stepped up their activities
inside the besieged city, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Some Russian military officers claimed that the Russian forces
would soon take over the city, the stronghold of Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister underlined that the Chechen people are the
major victims of the crisis, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi also announced readiness of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC) to send another high-ranking delegation to
 the region in the near future to continue discussions on the
Chechen crisis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, an OIC delegation led by Kharrazi visited
Moscow and Chechnya and discussed a possible political resolution
to the Chechen issue with Russian officials.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian FM, Russian Envoy Discuss Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
AMMAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister
Abdul Ilah Khatib Tuesday met with visiting Russian Presidential
Envoy for Middle East Affairs Vasily Sredin on the latest
developments in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed developments on all tracks of peace
 talks, Jordan's official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel for a
permanent peace deal by next September are under way, while
negotiations between Israel and its another key foe Syria will
resume Wednesday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Sredin, who is also Russia's deputy foreign minister,
expressed appreciation for  Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
and Jordan's efforts to help achieve a just and comprehensive peace
 in the region.
</P>
<P>
The envoy said Russia, a co-sponsor for the Middle East peace
 process besides the U.S., hoped to continue its consultations
with the kingdom over Middle East affairs.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is one of the only two Arab states, besides Egypt,
that signed a peace treaty with Israel. For years, it has been
making efforts to help achieve a comprehensive and lasting peace in
 the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he extended an invitation to Khatib from Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to visit Russia for talks on further
consolidating bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Khatib voiced Jordan's concern on the events
taking place in Chechenya and the dangers and pains confronting
civilians in the area.
</P>
<P>
But Khatib stressed Jordan's respect for the sovereignty of
the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
Sredin arrived in Amman Monday on a three-day visit on
bilateral ties and the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: America's Energy Appetite Rises Dramatically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUCSON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The use of energy in the United
States has jumped dramatically in the last half-century. Energy
consumption increased by 194 percent from 1949 to 1998, although
the U.S. population grew only 82 percent, according to figures
from the U.S. Department of Energy, issued here on the sideline of
the U.S.-Africa Energy Ministers Conference, slated for December
13-15.
</P>
<P>
The analysis indicates that the average amount of energy used
by every American rose 62 percent during that period, while the
amount of energy required to produce a dollar's worth of goods and
services fell by 42 percent, said the Environment News Service (
ENS).
</P>
<P>
"Fifty years ago, the nation was nearly self-sufficient in
petroleum and was a net exporter of natural gas," said the "Annual
Energy Review" released by the Energy Information Agency, a
division of the federal Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
In 1948, "only 17 percent of our coal was used to produce
electricity and nuclear electricity was just a gleam in physicists
' eyes," the review said. Now, 90 percent of coal is burned to
generate electricity, and nuclear power accounts for one-fifth of
the electricity supply in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Industry was the largest consumer of energy in the economy in
1948, but its share dropped from almost half (46 percent) to 38
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
At the same time residential and commercial consumption of
energy has increased from 29 to 36 percent. The transportation
sector has edged up from 25 to 27 percent over the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
U.S. energy was dominated by coal back in 1948, but coal has
given to natural gas and petroleum, although coal is still heavily
used to generate electricity in the nation.
</P>
<P>
In 1948, most U.S. homes used coal for heating, but now use of
coal in the home has become incidental.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power as a generator of electricity did not exist in
the U.S. until 1957, and it peaked in 1995 at 22 percent of
generation by utilities. Since 1990, the number of operable
nuclear reactors has declined as fewer new units came on line and
old units began to shut down.
</P>
<P>
Today nuclear power contributes about 10 percent to the nation'
s energy supply, the same amount as renewable sources, the Energy
Information Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Just as water power was relatively more important than wind
energy in preindustrial times, renewable energy today is dominated
by hydroelectric power. About half of the U.S. renewable total in
1998 came from hydroelectric power generation, which uses
damimpounded water to drive turbine generators that make
electricity.
</P>
<P>
Most of the rest of the U.S. renewable energy total came from
biomass, a diverse category that includes wood and wood waste,
methanol, and ethanol but also peat, wood liquors, wood sludge,
railroad ties, pitch, municipal solid waste, agricultural waste,
straw, tires, landfill gases, fish oils, and other things.
</P>
<P>
Geothermal energy was third in 1998, accounting for about five
percent of U.S. renewable energy production.
</P>
<P>
Solar energy (photovoltaic and thermal) contributes about one
percent to the renewable energy total while wind energy
contributes about 1.5 percent. About 90 percent of the solar
thermal collectors go to the residential sector. Ninety-three
percent of the collectors in the United States are used to heat
swimming pools, while seven percent are used for water heating and
less than one percent for space heating.
</P>
<P>
Prices for photovoltaic cells have edged down in recent years,
and the volume of shipments increased by a factor of 6.7 percent
between 1982 and 1997, the ENS report said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. wind energy production rose 89 percent between 1998 but
remains a very small factor in renewable energy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Energy's Annual Energy Outlook 1999
forecast, arrived at by the use of sophisticated computer
calculations suggests, "the near-term energy future will be one of
more: consumption, production, imports, and emissions."
</P>
<P>
Real energy prices are also expected either to increase only
modestly -- petroleum and natural gas -- or to decline -- coal and
electricity. These circumstances will encourage greater
consumption, and Annual Energy Outlook 1999 projects U.S. total
consumption to reach quadrillion Btu in 2020, 27 percent higher
than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Consumption is forecast to rise in all sectors. Growth is
predicted to be especially strong in transportation because of
more travel and greater freight requirements.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The handover of Macao to China
will help promote the Mozambican-Chinese relations, Mozambican
Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao said in a recent interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that with Macao as a bridge, the relations between
Mozambique and China will surely be further promoted," said Simao
who paid a visit to Macao several years ago.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that his country has had an honorary
consulate in Macao and the Chinese government has agreed to retain
it.
</P>
<P>
The traditional ties between the Portuguese-speaking southern
African country and Macao will be strengthened, Simao said.
</P>
<P>
Macao's return to China after being ruled by the Portuguese for
more than 150 years will offer more opportunities for the
cooperation between Mozambique and China, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
China and Portugal have set up a good example for the world by
resolving the issue of Macao through negotiations, Simao said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the Taiwan issue will also be resolved
satisfactorily," the minister said, citing the peaceful return of
Hongkong to China through peaceful negotiations.
</P>

The Mozambican minister will lead a delegation to Macao to
witness the handover later this month.

<P>
TEHRAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Tuesday blasted Israel for "
assassinating" two activists of the Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas).
</P>
<P>
Asefi expressed Iran's anger at the killing of two Hamas
activists by Israeli security agents and termed the act as "a
blatant example of state terrorism," the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army announced on Tuesday that its undercover troops
were fired at while approaching a house in Beit Awwa village near
Hebron on the West Bank and the forces killed two Hamas activists
and arrested three others in a response shootout.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media said that one of the dead was identified as Iyad
Batat, a regional Hamas military commander.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman said that committing such crimes while
chanting slogans in favor of peace betrayed contradiction in
policies being pursued by the Israeli regime.
</P>
<P>
Resort to terrorism and support for state terrorism are rooted
in the Israeli nature, he said, adding that the Israeli regime is
still main factor of instability and insecurity in the region.
</P>
<P>
Iran refused to recognize Israel after the 1979 Islamic
revolution and voiced its opposition to the Middle East peace
process, but it has close ties with the anti-Israeli militant
groups, including Hamas.

<P>
TEHRAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran is seeking direct foreign
investment to finance petrochemical projects in the country's third
 five-year development plan (2000-2005), Managing Director of the
Petrochemical International Company Mohammad Hadi Rahbari said on

</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Islamic Republic News Agency, Rahbari said Iran

investment.
</P>
<P>
The olefin-8 project will be carried out at Imam Khomeini port

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Vote on New Resolution on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Britain on Tuesday once again push the United Nations Security
Council to vote on a new comprehensive policy towards Iraq in a
bid to revive U.N. weapons inspection in the country.
</P>
<P>
The vote has been postponed for several days amid sharp
division among the members of the Security Council and the United
States and Britain did not want to see the draft resolution being
killed.
</P>
<P>
U.N. diplomats said some changes in the draft text have been
made over the night after consultations among capitals of the five
permanent members of the Council, namely China, Russia, France.
Britain and the United States, and they refused to give any
details.
</P>
<P>
A resolution needs nine positive votes and no vetoes from the
Council's five permanent members for adoption and the result of
the vote is still uncertain, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution seeks to create a new arms regime for Iraq
to replace the United Nations Special Commission in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction who has been barred
from returning to Iraq since the U.S.-led military strikes against
the country last December.
</P>
<P>
It, if adopted, would immediately lift the ceiling on how much
oil Iraq could sell in every six months under the oil-for-food
program which began to be implemented in late 1996 aimed to ease
the humanitarian crisis in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has reiterated that it would reject the resolution as an
American attempt to hide its "evil intentions."

<HEADLINE> Minister: Russia Needs No International Help in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia does not need help from
international organizations in resolving the conflict in Chechnya,
Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Avdeyev said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement, made in Makhachkala, regional capital of
Daghestan, came after OSCE chairman Knut Vollebaek's offer to
mediate between federal authorities and the Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe could
use its international influence in aiding Russia's anti-terrorist
operation in Chechnya by calling on all countries not to support
Chechen terrorists, Avdeyev said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a lack of go-betweens in the conflict but the
absence of an influential Chechen who could hold talks on behalf
of the republic," he said. "We feel that our colleagues in the
West underestimate the danger of terrorism. Our units in Chechnya
are defending the whole of Europe from the danger of terrorism as
well as Russia's integrity."
</P>
<P>
Avdeyev is accompanying Vollebaek, who is also Norwegian
Foreign Minister, in his North Caucasus tour, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek urged the Chechen rebels and the Russian authorities
to stop fighting and settle the conflict under OSCE mediation.
</P>
<P>
Russia launched the current military campaign against Chechen
rebels in September following their armed incursion into
neighboring Daghestan and a spate of terrorist bombings, also
blamed on the rebels, that killed about 300 people in Moscow and
two other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Vollebaek visited Daghestan's Botlikh district,
which was attacked by Chechen militants last summer.
</P>
<P>
He said he had seen the plight of civilians in Botlikh and
would like to urge the rebels and the Russian authorities to stop
military operations.
</P>
<P>
He said the OSCE is ready to join the effort to settle the
Chechen conflict at any moment.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE is an organization that has no armed forces of its own
and only has moral weight, and can act only on at the request of
the member-states, Vollebaek said.

<HEADLINE> Major Institutes Predict Upswing of German Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 14 (Xinhua)--Three major German economic
research institutes Tuesday predicted in their reports a strong
upswing for the country's economy in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
The Kiel World Economic Institute, the Hamburg Economic
Institute and the Institute for Economic Research in Halle all
concluded that German economy was ending its weak phase and was
set for robust expansion.
</P>
<P>
The projections of economic growth for the largest European
economy next year ranged between 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent in
reports of the three institutes.
</P>
<P>
The Hamburg institute said that the economic downturn in
Germany, triggered by the worldwide financial turbulence since
year 1997, was now "largely overcome."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the drop of the euro's exchange rate had clearly
boosted the competitiveness of German firms in overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
The three institutes foresaw a decline in joblessness next year,
although they said the job market improvement would largely be
confined in western Germany.
</P>
<P>
With prices expected to remain relatively stable and wage
agreements projected to show modest 2.2 per cent in pay rise,
Germany can also expect higher capacity utilization and
productivity next year, the three institutes' reports showed.

the hashish to transport to the northern Greek city of

UNITED NATIONS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Rauf Denktash, the
leader of the Turkish Cypriots, said on Tuesday that the next
round of Cyprus peace talks would resume in late January, 2000.

<P>
Speaking to reporters, Denktash said he would be back in late

Denktash and Glafcos Clerides, President of Cyprus and the
leader of the Greek Cypriots began the "proximity talks" on

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Host COMESA Summit: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will for the first time
host a summit of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) at the end of next February, a visiting senior Egyptian
official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Reda Bebars, ambassador in the Cabinet of the Foreign Minister
of the Egyptian Government, said that the aim of the conference is
to increase awareness of the international business community on
the COMESA as an emerging economic bloc that has a stable
predictable trade and investment regime.
</P>
<P>
Bebars and his delegation arrived here Monday for a three-day
visit to consult the Zambian government and the COMESA Secretariat
over the meeting to be held on February 28-29, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The conference with the theme of "COMESA 2000: the Emerging
Market" will also contribute to the identification and promotion
of investment opportunities in the COMESA region as well as
enhance intra-COMESA trade and economic relations, according to a
COMESA press release issued here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The summit is expected to contribute to the realization of a
COMESA free trade area due to start in October 2000.
</P>
<P>
The conference will discuss among other things, construction,
oil gas and petrochemicals, mining and minerals, banking and
financial services, capital markets, agriculture and
agro-business, manufacturing, tourism and information technology.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to attract over 1,000 delegates including
ministers from COMESA member countries, chief executive officers
of multi-national and regional companies, as well as
representatives of international cooperating partners.
</P>
<P>
The exports of Egypt to other COMESA members doubled after its
entry to the regional group last February.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's intra-COMESA trade hit 106.5 million U.S. dollars in
the first half of this year compared with 78.2 million dollars in
the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Freezes Abacha Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland has frozen more
than half a billion dollars in bank accounts related to the late
Nigerian dictator, Sani Abacha, according to Swiss Radio
International Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The authorities ordered a provisional block on any accounts in
the name of Abacha, his family and associates, the Swiss radio
said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a Swiss lawyer representing the Nigerian government
as saying, "There's no doubt that the Swiss authorities are going
to further confiscate in favor of the Nigerian government and
remit the funds to Nigeria."
</P>
<P>
"It is to the persons involved to prove that the money they
have comes from legitimate sources. It would be very difficult for
these people to prove that," he added.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria suspects the former military regime of systematic
corruption and embezzlement. It has asked Switzerland for help in
its investigation two months ago, and has until the middle of
January to make a formal request for legal assistance.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Sets New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The deficit in the current account, the broadest measure of
foreign trade, jumped by 11.2 percent in the third quarter this
year, up from 80.9 billion dollars in the second quarter, the
Department reported.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the current account deficit is running at an
annual rate of 319 billion dollars, 45 percent higher than last
year's 220 billion dollars imbalance.
</P>
<P>
The current account includes not only trade in goods and
services, but also investment flows and spending on foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
For the third quarter, the deficit in goods rose to 92.1
billion dollars, up from 84.4 billion dollars in the second
quarter. U.S exports of capital goods, including civilian aircraft,
were up by 4.6 percent but imports increased an even faster 6.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Three-fourths of the gain in imports reflected widespread gains
in manufactured goods while one-fourth of the increase was blamed
on a higher foreign petroleum bill, reflecting rising prices. The
government had earlier reported in its monthly trade figures that
foreign oil prices in September climbed to the highest level in
two years.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in services, such as airline fares and other types
of travel expenses, dropped to 18.3 billion dollars in the July-
September quarter, compared to 19.3 billion dollars in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The deficit in investment flows widened to 4.9 billion dollars
in the third quarter, compared to 4.6 billion dollars in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The category that includes foreign aid, known as net unilateral
transfers, was unchanged in the third quarter at 11.2 billion
dollars.

CAIRO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs

</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Some 220,000 Israelis were out of job in October
this year, representing 9.2 percent of the national work force,
according to figures announced by Israel's Central Bureau of
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in October was almost at the same level
recorded in August and September. In August, the unemployment rate
was 9 percent while that for September was 9.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM --Israeli National Infrastructure Minister Eli Suissa
 has ruled out the possibility importing water from Turkey to help
solve Israel's water shortage, after studying a report prepared by
a local water company.
</P>
<P>
The Mekorot Water Company said in its report that bringing
water from Turkey will be most costly than purifying water locally.
</P>
<P>
Israel is facing water shortage due to the dry weather and the
government has been studying the possibility of importing water
from Turkey for some time.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's Tourism Ministry said Tuesday that in
October this year, 282,200 foreign tourists visited Israel, the
highest monthly figure recorded since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Between January and October, 2.09 million foreign tourists
visited Israel. Of those, 1.478 million arrived by air.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's Transport Ministry plans to issue
international tenders seeking bids for a light-rail system in
Jerusalem and another one in Haifa. A tender for light train system
 for Jerusalem is expected within a few days, while a tender for
the planning of the Haifa system is expected within three months.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Basaran Ulusoy, chairman of the Turkish Association of
 Travel Agencies, said that Turkey's tourism revenue will increase
by 3-4 billion dollars due to the European Union's decision last
Friday to grant the country candidacy for membership.
</P>
<P>
Ulusoy said Turkey's existing tourism industry infrastructure
was sufficient to accommodate more tourists, and it was not
necessary to increase new investment to catch up with rising
demand, Turkish Daily News reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish Economy Minister Recep Onal urged investors to
 buy stocks if they want to make profits, saying the government has
 paved the way for substantial gains in the country's financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
Onal said "our recent banking arrangements seek to curb the cost
 of borrowing, which is two high in Turkey compared with other
countries," Turkish Daily News reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Once the government's new arrangements have yielded results, the
 production sector will be able to have access to resources at
reasonable costs, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Rise Slightly in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department said
Tuesday that consumer prices increased just 0.1 percent in
November, the best showing in five months.
</P>
<P>
The gain in the Consumer Price Index, the most closely watched
inflation gauge, followed a 0.2 percent rise in October, the
Department reported.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, consumer inflation has been rising at an
annual rate of 2.7 percent, compared with a 1.6 percent increase
in 1998, but all of the acceleration has reflected higher energy
costs.
</P>
<P>
If excluding the volatile energy and food categories, prices
were up by 0.2 percent, leaving the "core" rate of inflation
rising at a more moderate rate of 2 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve meets next week to decide whether to raise
interest rates again this year. Today's report on consumer prices
could ease concerns among economists and investors about a
potential outbreak of inflation. Financial markets will be looking
closely at the report for any clues as to what the Fed will do to
interest rates in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that clothing prices dropped by 0.5 percent
in November after posting sharp rises in the two previous months.
</P>
<P>
Overall energy prices were flat in November, reflecting falling
prices for gasoline and electricity and rising prices for fuel oil
and natural gas. Gasoline prices fell by 0.6 percent and
electricity prices decreased by 0.2 percent. But fuel oil jumped
by 2.6 percent and natural gas by 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last month, crude oil surged to its highest point since January
1991, when the Persian Gulf war drove up prices.
</P>
<P>
Production limits by oil-producing nations and increased demand
from recovering economies in Asia and from consumers preparing for
the winter accounted for the increase in some energy costs,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In November, food prices rose a slim 0.1 percent, the best
showing since June. A 3 percent decline in the price of vegetables
helped offset rising prices for pork, poultry and fruits.
</P>
<P>
Transportation prices were flat last month as new-car prices
held steady and airline fares rose by 0.7 percent, an improvement
over the 5.3 percent increase posted in October.

<HEADLINE> Sudan's FM Resigns in Discord With President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Sudan's Foreign Minister
Mustafa Ismail has resigned to protest against President Omar al-
Bashir's declaration of a state of emergency, a spokesman for the
ruling National Congress Party (NCP) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Mohamed Al-Hassan Al-Amin, added that other
ministers from the party were also expected to extend their
resignations.
</P>
<P>
Ismail's resignation came amid a political crisis that stemmed
from a power struggle between the president and the National
Assembly (parliament) Speaker Hassan al Turabi.
</P>
<P>
After El-Bashir declared a three-month state of emergency and
dissolved the parliament Sunday, the NCP said the president was
automatically disqualified from the party for violating its rules.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said Bashir took such measures in a bid to
prevent the parliament from meeting on Tuesday to pass legislation
curbing presidential powers to appoint and dismiss provincial
governors.
</P>
<P>
First Vice President Ali Osman Mohammed Taha, government
spokesman Ghazi Salah Eddin Attabani and six ministers in the 25-
member cabinet have publicly supported Bashir's actions.

<HEADLINE> Party Suspends Vasile's Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Just hours after Radu Vasile
was forced to quit from his premiership, his party decided on
Tuesday to suspend all party positions he has held and ban him
from being elected into the party leadership within two years.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Christian Democrat National Peasant' Party
of Romania (CDNPPR), said the decision was made according to
Vasile's performance since Vasile became Romanian premier April
1998, and especially during the current government crisis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Romanian President Emil Constantinescu and
ruling coalition partners announced the dismissal of Vasile as
premier after his party withdrew support and most ministers
resigned.
</P>
<P>
"He (Vasile) is unable to fulfill his duties since the majority
of his cabinet members have resigned, which means the government
is unable to function." Constantinescu's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
But Vasile said the president's action was "unconstitutional"
and vowed to bring the case to the court of appeal.
</P>
<P>
Vasile had been the general secretary of the CDNPPR before he
was named by his party as premier candidate. Under the party's
constitution, he can immediately resume his post in the party
after he relinquishes his premiership.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Vasile was choosing from his party
candidates to fill the vacancies left over by the ministers have
resigned.
</P>
<P>
Vasile is still supported by roughly half of the party members
and youth wing of the party.
</P>
<P>
In the meanwhile, many Romanian opposition parties, including
the Social Democracy Party of Romania, believed that the
president's dismissal of Vasile has violated the Constitution and
may plunge the country into political chaos.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Greater Romania Party has started to collect
signatures for ousting the president.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Attaches Great Importance to Energy Development in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUCSON, the United States, December 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S.
State Department official Tuesday told some 50 African energy
ministers here that the Clinton Administration is attaching great
importance to the energy development in Africa, which is rich in
both natural and human resources.
</P>
<P>
Susan Rice, assistant secretary of state for African affairs,
made the statement at the plenary session of the U.S-Africa Energy
Ministers Conference scheduled for December 13-15.
</P>
<P>
"This conference is testimony to how far we have to come over
the past few years. Africans and Americans, public and private
sectors, strive to build stronger ties and true partnership
between Africa and America," she said.
</P>
<P>
Rice outlined two major goals in the U.S. Africa policy: to
accelerate Africa's full integration into the global economy, and
to combat transnational security concerns such as terrorism,
proliferation, environmental degradation and diseases.
</P>
<P>
At present, "Americans are depending increasingly on Africa,
one of the world's most untapped energy markets, to fuel cars, to
heat living rooms and to power industry," she said. "Americans are
working hard to be both investors and consumers of African energy.
"
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the United States imported some 1.4 million barrels
of oil a day from Africa, accounting for some 17 percent of the
nation's total oil imports, in comparison to 23 percent of oil
imports from the oil-rich Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Rice said that the U.S. government, while turning to Africa as
an important source of U.S. energy, vowed to keep a good balance
between the energy development and environmental preservation in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
She cited an example to show how the Clinton Administration is
taking Africa seriously, saying that "five years ago, Africa was
nearly with the domain of a bureau under the State Department, and
the other is USAID. But now the Department of Energy, the
Department of Transportation and the Department of Commerce are
all proposing new initiatives to strengthen the U.S. relationship
with Africa."
</P>
<P>
"Under President (Bill) Clinton's Partnership Plan, the
Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) has dedicated three-
quarters of a billion dollars to encourage private investment in
Africa" to promote development, technical assistance and improve a
high-level dialogue on the cooperation between Africa and America,
she said.
</P>
<P>
"Roughly 30 African countries are liberalizing their trade
regimes, reducing tariffs, ending subsidies and fighting
corruption," she said, adding that African regional groups, such
as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the
Economic Community for West African States (ECOWAS) are also
playing an important role in the process.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the open plenary session, Bill Richardson, U.
S. secretary of energy, said that "energy is our future."
</P>
<P>
The United States, the economic superpower in the world, is
seeking African energy resources, oil and natural gas in
particular, to ensure its energy security at the turn of the
century as most African energy ministers agree that "energy is the
tool for development."

WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
warned Afghanistan's Taliban movement that it would be responsible
for any terrorist actions taken by Saudi-born exile Osama bin
Laden, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The head of the counter terrorism unit at the State (

that any terrorist activities by bin Laden group we would hold
Taliban responsible for," Lockhart told reporters.

"We wanted to make sure they understood that their support in

added.
</P>
<P>
The United States issued a worldwide caution on Saturday to its
citizens traveling abroad through the start of the New Year and
Ramadan, citing "credible information that terrorists are planning
attacks" against them.
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you that recently there were some suspects arrested
and we believe they belong to the bin Laden organization and were
planning terrorist attacks," Lockhart said.

He did not say where the people were arrested, saying the

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Stage Antiquities Exhibition in Japan to Mark Cradles of Civilizations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CAIRO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has decided to stage an
exhibition of antiquities in Japan next year as part of the
celebrations organized by Japan to mark the "cradles of
civilizations," the top Egyptian antiquities official said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition due to be held next August is designed to
showcase the greatness of Egypt's ancient civilization, said
Gaballah Ali Gaballah, secretary general of the Egyptian Higher
Council of Antiquities.
</P>
<P>
It will display about 100 pieces of antiquities dating back to
various eras of ancient Egypt, along with a selected collection of
ancient pieces reflecting the civilizations of China and India,
Gaballah was quoted by Egypt's official Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Higher Council of Antiquities took the decision
during a recent meeting with Minister of Culture Farouq Hosni, the
official added.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition also comes as part of Japan's celebrations to
mark the advent of the new millennium and falls within the
framework of Egypt's contribution to the world activities in this
regard, Gaballah said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will first display its antiquities in the Japanese
capital of Tokyo and later in some other cities for several months,
 he added.
</P>
<P>
He expected that the antiquities exhibition will offer an
important opportunity to boost the Japanese interest in visiting
Egypt and give a momentum to the development of the Egyptian
tourism industry.

<HEADLINE> MIF Grants 1 Million Dollars to Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Multilateral Investment
Fund (MIF), an autonomous fund administered by the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB), announced Tuesday the approval of a grant
of 1.05 million U.S. dollars to Panama to provide continuing
support to the Interoceanic Regional Authority to transfer
government-owned assets to private investors.
</P>
<P>
The expected investments will diversify the Panamanian economy
and generate new jobs by converting the former military facilities
surrounding the Panama Canal to commercial uses, the IDB said.
</P>
<P>
The resources will provide technical support for the concession,
sale, or leasing of a list of assets and finance the hiring of
expert consultants for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
The operation is timed with transfer of 14 U.S. military bases
and approximately 149,000 hectares of land with 7,200 buildings of
differing sizes under the terms of the Carter-Torrijos treaties,
which provides for the full transfer of the Interoceanic Region to
Panamanian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
An MIF grant of 600,000 dollars approved in 1997 financed legal
and other specialized services to advise the Interoceanic Regional
Authority on state-of-the art techniques for the privatization
process. The current MIF financing deepens and widens the previous
operation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says U.S. Continues to Ensure Panama Canal Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Tuesday that the U.S. will continue its commitment to the
Panama Canal's security and the transfer of the canal to Panama
underscores U.S. confidence in Panama's ability to manage the
canal.
</P>
<P>
A transfer ceremony was held in Panama Tuesday, but Clinton,
and other senior U.S. officials failed to attend it.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Clinton said the U.S. will continue to
"work closely with Panama to safeguard the canal and promote the
well-being of our citizens and people around the world."
</P>
<P>
"Today's ceremony underscores our confidence in the government
of Panama and the Panamanian people's ability to manage this vital
artery of commerce," he added.
</P>
<P>
"It also signals our continuing commitment to the security of
the canal, as enshrined in our treaty obligations, and our
determination to work with Panama and the many other countries
that use the canal to ensure that it remains open to the world's
shipping and commerce," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
After the transfer, the canal will be run by the Canal
Authority, an autonomous institution created with the consensus of
all political parties in Panama.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Vice President Al Gore is busy with his campaign to
replace Clinton in 2000, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
will stay at home to push the Isreal-Syria peace talks and at last
the U.S. delegation was headed by Former President Jimmy Carter,
who signed the treaties with Panama in 1977 to turn over the canal
to Panama.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration rejected suggestions that absence of
senior U.S. officials from the ceremony was linked to conservative
criticism of the transfer. Some congressmen feared that the Canal'
s security may be endangered after the U.S. withdraws.
</P>
<P>
"At the edge of a new century, the canal, long a symbol of
American power and prestige, now also symbolizes the unity and
common purpose of the democratic nations of the Americas," Clinton
added.

SANTIAGO,, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Justice Minister
Soledad Alvear Tuesday resigned to join the left-wing presidential
candidate Ricardo Lagos for the runoff on January 16.
</P>
<P>
"The decision I have taken today is transcendental. As a woman,
a democrat and a Christian, I consider a duty to work in the
campaign of Ricardo Lagos with the purpose of having a third
Concertacion government," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
She announced that Justice Vice Minister Jose Antonio Gomez
will assume as minister during the three remaining months of the
present government.
</P>
<P>
Lagos and right-wing populist Jaquin Lavin will campaign ahead
of the Jan. 16 second-round vote to decide who will lead the South
American country's 15 million people.
</P>
<P>
Lagos of the center-left ruling Concertation coalition won
Sunday the slimmest of victories over Lavin. No one got 50 percent
of the votes in the first round of voting.
</P>
<P>
It is thought that the former Justice minister participation in
the campaign of Lagos, whose majority was obtained in the first
round of voting, is aimed at getting the vote of women.

<P>
MAPUTO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's main opposition
party, the former rebel movement Renamo (Mozambique National
Resistance), on Tuesday claimed victory in the country's general
elections, but according to the law, the official results should

party in the next parliament.
</P>
<P>
Renamo projected that Dhlakama will win between 51.3 and 52.5
percent of the presidential vote, while the incumbent, Joaquim
Chissano with some 47.5 to 48.7 percent. Taimo Jamisse,
chairman of the election commission, said that Renamo must assume
full responsibility for its declaration, adding that the
commission will publish the final results sometime later.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique held its second multi-party presidential and
parliamentary elections on December 3-5 since 1994, which the

<HEADLINE> WWF Calls for European Coastline Risk Assessment After Latest Oil Spill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of the latest oil
spill off the coast of Brittany of France, the World Wide Fund for
Nature (WWF) Tuesday called for a formal risk assessment of Europe
's western seaboard and the approaches to the continent's major
oil ports and harbors.
</P>
<P>
The international conservation organization stressed that five
of the world's last 10 major oil spills happened on this stretch
of coastline. The fact clearly illustrates the need for such an
assessment to be undertaken by the region's national governments
with the support of the European Commission, it added.
</P>
<P>
"It's crucial to assess the environmental sensitivity of Europe
's coastline and its vulnerability to shipping activity,
especially in areas where there is heavy traffic of hazardous
cargoes," said Sian Pullen, head of WWF international shipping
policy.
</P>
<P>
That includes, for example, measuring the volume and type of
shipping traffic, and determining the increased dangers associated
with bad weather. "WWF wants to see the appropriate regulations
introduced to reduce the risks of continued shipping incidents to
Europe's coastal waters and marine wildlife," she added.
</P>
<P>
The WWF is also calling for sufficient emergency response
systems to be established in waters that are difficult to navigate,
and where there are adjacent sensitive coastal areas. It welcomed
France's decision to launch a full investigation into why the
tanker Erika broke up Sunday morning, and how that could have been
prevented.
</P>
<P>
The Malta-registered tanker, carrying around 26,000 tons of
heavy fuel oil, broke in two after being lashed by gale-force
winds and waves up to six meters high. Between two and five
thousand tons of its load were spilled into the sea, 70 km off the
coast of Brittany.
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear how much, if any, of the resulting slick
will reach the coast, as continuing stormy weather is helping to
break it up at sea, according to the WWF. However, the threat
remains for the area and its wildlife, especially seabirds and
marine mammals.

The sources said Mubarak would hold talks with Saudi King Fahd
Ibn Abdul-Aziz on Arab, regional and international issues, the
Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Their talks, they said, will focus especially on the latest
developments in the Arab-Israeli peace talks in light of the
positive step toward the resumption of negotiations on the Syrian-
Israeli track.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria have agreed to resume peace negotiations "at
the point where they broke off" in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syria's Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Sharaa, on behalf of President Hafez Assad, are expected
to meet in Washington Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The key of the Syrian-Israeli talks is the future of the Golan
Heights and the 17,000 Israelis who settled there after Israel
captured the plateau in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
The Arab sources believed that the meeting between Saudi-

<HEADLINE> 2 Lebanese Civilians Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Two Lebanese civilians were
wounded Wednesday in military clashes between Israeli forces and
Lebanese guerrillas, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
A woman was injured when the Beit Yahoun Bayada village in which
 she lived inside the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon
 was hit by Israeli shells, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Another man was seriously wounded when shells hit his car in
Zawtar Sharqia village.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, said in a
statement that its fighters had launched a series of attacks on
Israeli posts, causing direct hit on their targets.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli warplanes blasted villages and hills on the
 verge of the border zone which are believed as the hideouts of
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust the Israeli occupation troops
out of the country.

<HEADLINE> New Law Seeks to Protect Investment of Taiwan Compatriots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua)-- The recently-issued rules for
implementing the Law on Protecting Investment of Taiwan
Compatriots is a major step towards encouraging Taiwan compatriots
to invest in the mainland, said Shi Guangsheng, minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), today.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that economic exchanges and cooperation across the
Taiwan Straits is vital to the long-term economic development in
both Taiwan and the mainland.
</P>

obstruct economic exchanges and cooperation, the detailed rules of
the law will have a positive and long-term impact in the area by
encouraging Taiwan businessmen to invest in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is the mainland's fifth major trade partner. Taiwan's
investment in the mainland ranks fourth among overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
He explained that MOFTEC spent over three years consulting
Taiwan businessmen on drafting the details on implementing the Law
on Protecting Investment of Taiwan Compatriots, which was issued
in March, 1994
</P>
<P>
Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State
Council, said that the law demonstrates the mainland's
determination in protecting the business interests of Taiwan
compatriots.

invested in more than 43,000 projects in the mainland, involving a
contractual value of 43.585 billion U.S. dollars. And cross-

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Seventy percent of the Angola's
12.6 million people are living below the poverty line, a report
issued by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP office in Angola said in the report that destructive
civil war and the remnant colonist impact have dragged most
Angolans into dire penury, Angola's official news agency ANGOP
reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Angolan government has failed to achieve
its objectives for stabilizing and rehabilitating the economy in
1998-2000, mainly due to the renewed civil conflicts in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
Although the rebels of the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) have fled into forest areas, the
Angolan people can not yet expect an immediate peace, it added.
</P>
<P>
Without peace, the Angolan government has to fight against the
rebels instead of leading a campaign against the poverty,
stabilizing the economic and social situation, and improving the
welfare of the Angolan people.
</P>
<P>
Angola, as a country enjoying abundant natural resources such
as diamond and petroleum reserves, has great potential to develop
its economy and improve the human development.

<HEADLINE> Russia Plans to End Chechen War By March: General Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia plans to end its anti-
terrorist operations in the breakaway republic of Chechnya by the
end of February next year, said a top Russian military official
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It will "take another two to three months" to eliminate the
militants in Chechnya, said General Valery Manilov, first deputy
chief of the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff, at a meeting
with foreign military attaches at the General Staff Academy.
</P>
<P>
He said about 12,000 to 15,000 militants have remained in
Chechnya, including some 2000 terrorists and bandits backed by
foreign extremists, adding that "this terrorist army will have to
be eliminated unless the bandits surrender and lay down their arms.
"
</P>
<P>
Manilov said the federal troops would liberate Grozny, capital
of Chechnya, and he promised that "no massive attacks or storming
of Grozny will be launched while even one civilian remains."
</P>
<P>
Now the Russian troops control over 60 percent of Chechnya's
territory in which about 90 percent of the Chechen population
were living.
</P>
<P>
"A total of 120 Chechen villages have been cleared of militant
formations. Particularly the flat territory of Chechnya has been
completely freed of bandits and terrorists," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
The militants are fortifying their positions in sparsely
populated mountainous and semi-mountainous areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Russian troops freed the second biggest Chechen
city of Gudermes and three other key Chechen towns of Argun, Urus-
Martan and Shali, completing the surrounding of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Russia began its military operations in Chechnya in late
September after Chechen rebels' armed incursions into the
neighboring republic of Dagestan and a spate of apartment building
blasts that claimed over 300 people in Moscow and two other
Russian cities. The Russian authorities blamed Chechen extremists
for planning and carrying out terrorist acts.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Wednesday submitted a draft national budget of 358.777
billion rials (about 119.59 billion U.S. dollars) for the coming
year to the Majlis (parliament) for approval.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Majlis, Khatami said the budget for the new
Iranian calendar year (starting March 21, 2000) shows an increase
of 29.9 percent from that of the current year.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total amount, 125.953 billion rials (about 41.98
billion dollars) is allocated to the government budget and the rest
 to the budget for organizations and profit-making institutes
affiliated to the government and banks.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government budget shows a 14.8 percent increase
 compared to this year's budget while the budget for organizations
and profit-making institutes enjoys a 30.8 growth, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that the government's income is estimated at 110.
395 billion rials (about 36.80 billion dollars), showing a 16.1
percent increase from this year's figure.
</P>
<P>
He said that out of the amount 31 percent are tax incomes, 49
percent oil revenues and 20 percent other incomes.
</P>
<P>
The budget put the current expenditure at 80.849 billion rials
(about 26.95 billion dollars) with a growth of 26.3 percent and the
 development expenses at 24.670 billion rials (about 8.22 billion
dollars) with a 20 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
He said that the credits allocated to judicial fairs have risen
by 61.5 percent, to preservation of order and security by 54.5
percent, to defense affairs by 31 percent and social security 50
percent compared to what had been predicted for the current year.
</P>
<P>
Khatami noted that in the next year budget, priority has been
given to implementation of special job-creating projects, and
necessary mechanisms have been predicted to support investment on
small industries and job creating groups in the form of
cooperatives and self-employment units.
</P>
<P>
The credits predicted for payment of subsidies on basic
commodities with a growth of 19.6 percent will be equal to 7.950
billion rials (about 2.65 billion dollars) for the next year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami noted that the present subsidy payment system for basics
 has some flaws and the government believes any other alternative
depends on finding suitable mechanisms to protect the low-income
groups and prevent damage to the society.

<P>
PARIS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Defense Commission of the
French National Assembly presented a report on the Kosovo War
Wednesday after making a study on the cause of the war.
</P>
<P>
The report, presented by defense commission chairman Socialist
deputy Paul Quiles, said that the "intransigence" of the Yugoslav
authorities on Kosovo made it necessary for NATO to intervene.
</P>
<P>
It said that the "diplomatic effort" launched by the Western
countries since 1997 for solving the Kosovo crisis was "constant,
sincere and resolved."
</P>
<P>
The report, written by a team of French parliament deputies
headed by Socialist Francois Lamy, was adopted by all deputies at
the National Assembly except a Communist deputy.
</P>
<P>
"The failure of the talks (in Rambouillet), attributable to the
Serb intransigence, led inevitably to the confrontation," it said.
</P>
<P>
The deputies also regretted that NATO announced at the
beginning of the conflict that it would exclude a ground
intervention.
</P>
<P>
"NATO should have kept a certain ambiguity on its strategic
choices," it said.

<P>
OTTAWA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada's hi-tech firms may
discover unexpected business opportunities by helping less
developed countries solve the Y2K bug problem, the country's Globe
and Mail newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Canada has done all it can for Y2K. It is the place to be for
the rollover," a senior official at the federal Y2K project office
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Since Canada is so well prepared for Y2K, Canadian companies
could pick up business from firms elsewhere that may be hurt by Y2
K problems," said Guy McKenzie, the Y2K spokesman for the
Department of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Canadians are already in Ukraine helping with Chernobyl-type
nuclear power reactors, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government has established its own backup
satellite communications systems so that Ottawa can keep in touch
with its 132 diplomatic posts around the world, said the report.
</P>
<P>
How the rest of the world fares on New Year's Eve will be
closely monitored by the officials in Ottawa, including Defense
Minister Arthur Eggleton, Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy,
Industry Minister John Manley and Treasury Board President
Lucienne Robillard, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Li Ruihuan's Asia Trip Is Successful: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGASAKI, Japan, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese leader Li
Ruihuan's three-nation Asia visit has been a success and has
attained expected goals of enhancing mutual understanding,
deepening friendship and expanding cooperation with the host
countries, said a senior Chinese official Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Wantong, general secretary of the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
made the statement in an interview with Xinhua on Li's official
visit to Sri Lanka, Maldives and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee made the
trip at the invitation of the three governments. This was Li's
first visit to the three countries as CPPCC chairman and an
important diplomatic mission by one of China's top leaders this
year, Zheng Wantong said.
</P>
<P>
During the journey, Li met with top leaders of the three
countries, briefing them on China's domestic situations, and
exchanging views in depth with them on how to advance bilateral
relations and on some regional and international issues of common
interest.
</P>
<P>
In meeting with Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga, Li
said that all countries in the world, developing countries in
particular, should give top priority to developing economy,
improving people's livelihood and strengthening unity.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with Maldivian President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, Li
attributed China's conspicuous achievements in economic and other
social aspects to the principle of "seeking truth from facts"
advocated by Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of China's reform
and opening up.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Sri Lanka and Maldives hailed the smooth development
of their relations with China whatever changes in the world.
</P>
<P>
Li's visit to Japan is all the more spectacular. During his
meeting with Emperor Akihito, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and
other Japanese leaders, Li spoke highly of Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's last year visit to Japan, during which the two countries
agreed to work for the establishment of a friendly and cooperative
partnership for peace and development, thus charting the path for
the development of bilateral relations in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Li said, "We should not forget the past but
should all the more look to the future" through efforts in
educating the younger generations.
</P>
<P>
And on the part of China, he noted, it "will not forget its old
friends, wishes to make more new friends and hopes always to be
friends with them."
</P>
<P>
Li's interview by Nippon Hoso Kyokai(NHK) is believed to have
pushed the visit to a climax. Li's slashing of the so-called "
China threat", the "two country doctrine" put forward by the
Taiwan authorities and his great insight into Macao's return, Sino-
Japanese relations and environmental protection, have enriched the
issues with newer and broader content. Li said the raising of the
so-called "China threat" is in essence to threat China and not
allow it to develop. However, he stressed, China's development is
irresistible and beneficial to the world community.
</P>
<P>
In whipping the "two country doctrine", Li explained why China
can not commit itself to not using force to settle the Taiwan
issue. "No Chinese leader nor any generation of the Chinese
leadership has the right to discard Taiwan from its motherland,"
Li said, "And anyone should not underestimate China's
determination and capability on the issue."

<P>
The UN experts said that Beijing is playing an important role
in the global circulation of cash and technology, attracting about
160 major multinational corporations and 300 large international
financial companies.
</P>
<P>
The output value of service industry in major international
cities around the world accounts for at least 70 percent of the
total gross domestic product (GDP). The experts pointed out the
output value of Hong Kong's service industry accounts for 82
percent of its GDP, adding that Beijing still has a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
The total output value of Beijing's service industry reached
100 billion yuan (about 12 billion U.S. dollars) last year,
accounting for 56.3 percent of its GDP, said Zhang Mao, deputy
mayor of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The experts advised the Beijing municipal government to
encourage competition and adopt favorable policies to accelerate
growth of service industry.
</P>
<P>
They said that Beijing is not only the political and cultural
center of China, but also the center of information and technology
with vast human resources necessary for developing its service
industry.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Has High Hopes for Talks with MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada expressed hope Wednesday that the peace talks with the
separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) will yield
positive results so genuine and lasting peace can finally reign in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The president said he has high hopes the MILF will prove true
to their pronouncements of sharing the government's desire to
silence the guns in the South to pave the way for its
transformation into the country's next food basket and economic
hub.
</P>
<P>
"I am hoping that we will have genuine peace in our country.
The first round of the formal peace talks between the government
and the MILF has started," said the president in a radio program.
</P>
<P>
"I truly believe that the talks will be fruitful. Let us hope
that our Muslim brothers will prove true to their promise to help
us achieve peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
The government sealed a cease-fire agreement with the MILF in
1997 so the two sides can conduct peace negotiations and that pact
stands up to now.
</P>
<P>
But Estrada warned rebel groups that the government will not
tolerate armed assaults and condemned the attack launched by the
rebel New People's Army (NPA) on a police headquarters in Danao,
Bohol province, resulting in the death of two cops.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government called off offensive operations
against the NPA from December 10 to January 9, 2000 in observance
of the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NPA also declared holiday cease-fire from
December 22 to December 25 and from December 30 to January 2, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Estrada reminded the military in Mindanao to respect
the traditional period of Ramadan observed by the MILF, but
stressed that violations of an existing cease-fire should not be
tolerated and that the people should be protected from any
aggression.

<HEADLINE> Partial Oromo Military Officials Based in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The first flight of Oromo
military officials have left Somalia in accordance with an
agreement signed between Somali faction leader Hussein Mohamed
Aidid and the Ethiopian government.
</P>
<P>
Among them are General Waqow Gudow, main commander of the Oromo
 Liberation Front (OLF) fighters based in southern Somalia, and
eight other senior military commanders.
</P>
<P>
They left the Ballidogleh airport, 90 kilometers south of
Mogadishu, Tuesday, diplomats in Mogadishu said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Since early in the year, hundreds of OLF fighters together
with their weapons and ammunition had arrived in southern Somalia,
making the war torn nation of somalia just another battlefield for
Ethiopia-Eritrea confrontation.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the offices of the OLF fighters in
Mogadishu had been closed down with the presence of Libyan and
Egyptian diplomats as a move to implement the first part of the
agreement signed by Aidid and the Ethiopian government on October
27 this year.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Libya and Egypt, the brokers of the
agreement, were mandated by the Arab League to supervise the
demilitarization of the border areas between southern Somalia and
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Most of the OLF fighters have crossed to Ethiopia months before
the agreement was signed so as to fight against the forces of
Addis Ababa regime of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi.
</P>
<P>
There are still 108 former military personnel from the OLF in
southern Somalia. However, this force had been disarmed with the
supervision of the Libyan and Egyptian diplomats and they are now
living as ordinary Somali civilians.
</P>
<P>
Some of them have already reported to have engaged in managing
small farms of their own in Lower Shabelleh region, while others
are living as refugees.
</P>
<P>
According to officials of Aidid, the departure of the Oromo
officials has concluded the fulfillment of their side on the
agreement reached in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa.

<HEADLINE> Macao Nearing Goal of Localizing Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Macao has basically realized the
localization of laws so far, but another more than 20 technical
regulations including two important laws, the Labor Procedural
Code and Tax Procedural Code, which still need to be localized, a
Macao government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Sam Chan Io, coordinator of the Law Translation Office of the
Macao government, said at a press conference today that Macao has
basically completed the localization of laws with the localization
of important codes, accessory codes and the drafting of new laws
by the Legislative Assembly to replace old laws.
</P>
<P>
Laws localized so far include five basic codes in Macao, namely
Criminal Code, Criminal Procedural Code, Civil Code, Civil
Procedural Law and Commerce Code, and some other major codes
concerning notarization, registration, administrative procedures
and industrial property.
</P>
<P>
Localization of laws, localization of civil servants and the
official status of the Chinese language are three major issues
concerning the smooth transition and transfer of power in Macao,
which is to return to China on Dec. 20 after being ruled by the
Portuguese for more than 150 years.
</P>
<P>
Sam Chan Io said the basic goal of localizing the laws in Macao
is to have laws that address local conditions, meet with the need
in modern times, and are drafted in both Chinese and Portuguese
languages.
</P>
<P>
Laws in Macao derive from the law system on the European
continent, with most of them originated in Portugal and drafted in
Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
Sam Chan Io said the translation of the Macao laws into Chinese,
as an important part of the work in localizing laws, has been
completed, with the Macao government publicizing the Chinese
version of 76 laws by September this year.
</P>
<P>
All these laws were drafted between 1976 and 1992, since all
laws drafted after 1992 are in both Chinese and Portuguese
languages, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Although about 20 technical regulations still need to be
localized to achieve the final localization of laws, the goal has
been basically reached since these regulations are not very
important, Sam said.
</P>
<P>
Sam also pointed out that Macao will continue to absorb new
ideas from Portugal on law interpretation after its return to
maintain the vitality of the local laws.

<HEADLINE> Oriental Venice Rebuilds Landscaped Gardens (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Landscaped Gardens in east
China's Suzhou City, known as the "Oriental Venice " because of
the legendary Italian traveler Marco Polo, is attracting an
uninterrupted flow of visitors from both home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
While marveling at the delicate design containing hills, ponds,
pavilions, terraces, corridors and towers, most visitors to the 2,
500-year-old city in Jiangsu Province probably don't know that
these picturesque gardens, now on the World Heritage list, were
almost completely destroyed before the founding of New China in
1949.
</P>
<P>
But for the efforts by the government and the local people's
love for traditional Chinese architectural art, the gardens wouldn
't have been restored and renovated to its original splendor, said
Xie Xiaosi, a 95-year-old resident in Suzhou.
</P>
<P>
The gardens of Suzhou can be dated back to as early as about
514 B.C. when the city was built. There were as many as 200
gardens dotted in the city in its prime during the 16th to 18th
centuries.
</P>
<P>
The gardens have long been considered as the quintessence of
Chinese horticulture. The World Heritage Committee refers to
Suzhou as the cradle of horticulture in the world.
</P>
<P>
Many of these gardens, however, suffered serious damage from
wars in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The "Garden of Leisure,"
for example, built in 1596 with an area of 20,000 square meters,
was destroyed by the Japanese invaders and later used as stables
by Kuomintang troops in the 1940s.

In the early 1950s, a huge campaign was launched to restore the
gardens of Suzhou. The best craftsmen from all over China were
called in to restore historical doors, windows, bricks, tiles and
furniture as well as calligraphy and paintings in the gardens.
</P>
<P>
In the last 20 years, 200 million yuan has been spent on
restoring the gardens. A number of research institutes have also
been actively involved in the restoration work.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 gardens have been restored. About 30 of these are
now open to the public. The Suzhou municipal government and more
than 130 factories have moved out of the old city area to help
preserve the gardens. More than 800 historical lanes and about 200
bridges have been restored.
</P>
<P>
"Suzhou gardens are unparalleled. Their preservation and
protection by the Chinese is internationally recognized," said
Bernd Von Droste, director of UNESCO's World Heritage Center.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou gardens were put on UNESCO's World Heritage list in
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Xu Wentao, director of the Suzhou Gardens Bureau, said that the
gardens are Suzhou's most valuable asset. If it was not due to the
efforts of locals and the city's government, the gardens wouldn't
have survived.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior police officer said
here today that he is optimistic about the public security
conditions in the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), which
will be founded on December 20.
</P>
<P>
Police forces of the Macao SAR will have closer and more
effective cooperation with their counterparts in China's interior
areas and Hong Kong, Cheong Iok Kuan, advisor for secretary of
security of the Macao government, said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Macao's public security has drawn great attention from the
authorities and the entire society, and the government has spared
no effort to combat organized crimes. "The efforts to improve
public security have produced good effect," he said.
</P>
<P>
The veteran police officer said that gang members in Macao
usually do not target ordinary residents or tourists, and the
public security is not as formidable as described by some media.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the crime rate of Macao is lower than that in some
large cities of the world," Cheong added.

<HEADLINE> Weizman Urges Religious Party to Support Peace with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman Wednesday urged a powerful ultra-Orthodox religious party
in the ruling coalition to support the effort by Prime Minister
Ehud Barak to reach a peace agreement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Weizman made the appeal during his meeting with Eli Yishai,
leader of the Shas party, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Holding 17 seats in the Knesset (parliament), Shas is a key
partner in Barak's coalition, which enjoys a 68-seat majority in
the 120-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
Barak chose Shas as a coalition partner after winning a general
election in May mainly because he wanted to garner as much as
support for his peace policy with Israel's Arab neighbors. Shas
holds a moderate position in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
But the party abstained in a parliamentary vote Monday over
Barak's policy statement on the renewed peace talks with Syria. As
a result, Barak only won a narrow majority in the parliament over
his statement.
</P>
<P>
Barak will hold talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-
Sharaa in Washington later Wednesday, resuming the negotiations
between the two sides after nearly four years of suspension.
</P>
<P>
Without the support of Shas, any peace agreement Barak reached
with Syria would not be approved by the parliament since Israeli
laws stipulate that an agreement with Syria must be supported by an
 absolute majority of 61 legislators.
</P>
<P>
Yishai explained that while Shas supports peace talks with
Syria, Shas legislators abstained in Monday's voting because Barak
had failed to provide them the details about the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He denied allegations that the party's abstention was connected
to an ongoing dispute with the government over the funding of its
debt-ridden religious school system. The Treasury and Education
Ministry have demanded that the party adopt a reform plan before
its school system could get funding.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef is
reportedly about to start a series of consultations with top
generals and politicians before he makes a religious ruling on the
peace talks with Syria. The spiritual leader is the ultimate
decision-maker of the party.
</P>
<P>
A decade ago Yosef ruled that territories must be ceded if that
means an end to any bloodshed, and this has been Shas' guiding
principle on peace talks. But some senior Shas politicians are
concerned now that the security of Israel could be compromised with
 a return to the border on the eve of the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
One of the most contentious issues between Israel and Syria is
Syria's demand that Israel withdraw its troops from the occupied
Golan Heights back to the pre-1967 war border, which would give
Syria control over the shore of the Sea of Galilee, the main source
 of fresh water for Israel.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Likud legislators criticized Weizman Wednesday for
what they called his intervention in politics while the public is
splitting over the issue of the Israeli-Syrian talks. They said the
 president should stay above party politics.
</P>
<P>
The sharp-mouthed Weizman, a strong advocate of Israeli-Arab
peace, has also angered the Jewish settlers in the Golan Heights
who oppose Barak's peace talks with Syria by expressing unequivocal
 support for the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
But Weizman denied he was taking a political stand, saying he
had always spoken out only in favor of what he thought was good for
 the nation.

<HEADLINE> Boss of Leading S.African Soccer Club Shot to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Kaizer Chiefs Club, South
Africa's most popular soccer team, found its director and founder
Clarence Mlokoti was fatally shot during an attempted carjacking,
police in Soweto said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Two gunmen approached Mlokoti's car as it was stopped at a
house in Soweto Tuesday evening, said police Inspector Mbazima
Shiburi. They demanded the keys from Mlokoti's daughter, who had
been driving.
</P>
<P>
"On getting inside the car, they noticed there was somebody in
the back seat and shot him," said Putco Mafani, a team spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen fled, and Mlokoti, 69, later died in a hospital,
according to Shiburi.
</P>
<P>
Mlokoti founded the team and was a member of its board of
directors. Though based in Johannesburg, the Chiefs have a wide
national following and fans throughout the continent.
</P>
<P>
Mlokoti, a soft-spoken man, was responsible for introducing
sponsorship to black South African teams in the early 1970s,
inducing the corn meal company where he worked in marketing to
back the Chiefs, Mafani said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League Secretary General

Esmat Abdel-Meguid on Wednesday expressed welcome to the resumption
of the Syrian-Israeli peace talks after a freeze of nearly four
years.
</P>
<P>
The restart of the negotiations on the Syrian track will help
further promote the Middle East peace process, Abdel-Meguid told
reporters after meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to see a just and comprehensive peace on the Syrian,
Palestinian and Lebanese tracks," the chief of the Cairo-based
pan-Arab organization was quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle East
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel are to resume talks later Wednesday in
Washington. They will tackle the Israeli withdrawal from the Golan
Heights it captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War, security
arrangements, right to water resources and normalization of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said that he and Moussa also dealt with the latest
developments in the Arab world and exchanged views on the related
Arab League role in seeking ways of ironing out differences and
restoring solidarity of the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the latest developments of the situation in Sudan,
he expressed the league's support for the steps taken recently by
Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab League has issued a statement backing the Sudanese
legitimacy. This is its absolute right. The league's stands are
clear, concerning the unity of Sudan and its territorial integrity.
We are keen on that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir declared Sunday night a three-month state of
emergency in all parts of the country and dissolved the Parliament
in what he said an effort to maintain national stability and
territorial integrity.

<P>
MANILA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Presidential
Palace ruled out Wednesday the transfer of the dollar account of
the late President Ferdinand Marcos from the Philippine National
Bank (PNB) to the Central Bank of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said in a statement that
the deposit is bound to stay with the PNB under an escrow
agreement sealed between the parties as approved by the Swiss
Courts.
</P>
<P>
"Without the necessary judicial approval of a new escrow
agreement,the transfer of the dollar account from the PNB as
escrow agent to the Central Bank would be clearly illegal," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Barican also noted that the government retains a 30 percent
stake in the PNB which, like other commercial banks, operates
under the close supervision of the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of the dollar account of the Marcos family was
proposed by former Solicitor General Francisco Chavez, claiming
that the PNB is now in private hands.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Supreme Court earlier ruled that the money deposited
by the late president should be held in escrow until the
Philippine courts decide on the claims over the account of various
parties,including the government, the Marcos heirs, and the
victims martial law.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Issue New Banknote on First Day of Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Macao will issue new banknote on
December 20 -- the first day it returns to the motherland,
announced the Monetary and Cambial Authority of Macao (MCAM).
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the MCAM Anselmo Teng told a press conference here
today that the new banknote is issued to mark Macao's return to
the motherland, and the issuing date on the notes has been
accordingly changed to December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Another change on the face of the notes is the new signatures
of current general managers of the Macao Branch of the Bank of
China (BOC) and the Macao Branch of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino
(BNU), the two note-issuing banks in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The total face value of the new issuance will be 2.26 billion
Patacas, of which 1.31 billion will be issued by the BOC and 950
million by the BNU, Teng said.
</P>
<P>
The new notes include face values of 20 Patacas, 50 Patacas,
100 Patacas, 500 Patacas and 1,000 Patacas, which will circulate
together with the existing notes, he added.
</P>
<P>
With the new issuance, the total cash volume of the Macao
Patacas has exceeded 6.8 billion, which is sufficient to meet
resident's needs.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of the BOC Macao Branch Zhu Chi said that his
bank has completed all the necessary preparations for issuing the
new banknote, and will begin to supply the new notes from December
20.
</P>
<P>
"Joining in the new issuance in Macao reflects BOC's full
confidence in Macao's social and economic development prospects
and BOC's active commitment to protecting Macao's economic and
financial stability and development," he said.

SEOUL, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Shares on the Seoul stock market
plunged 39.06 points to 963.58 Wednesday due to the movement of
foreign funds and profit-taking by institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Composite Stock Price Index has gone beyond
the psychologically important 1,000-point level over the past few
days.
</P>
<P>
Observers said South Korean businesses are expected to remain

when problems like Y2K abound.
</P>
<P>
There is plenty of room for the stock market to rebound over
the 1,000-point market by the end of the year because of the
strong South Korean economy. The stock price index is estimated to
climb to as high as 1,300 points.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
have repelled Tamil rebels' repeated attempts since last Saturday
to take a strategically important causeway, a military spokesman
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, spokesman Brigadier Sunil
Tennekoon also said that 480 rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE)and 28 government soldiers were killed in the fighting
since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said government troops had 28 confrontations with the LTTE
rebels in the last four days near the Elephant Pass causeway,
about 280 km northeast of Colombo, which links the mainland and
the northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
However, the LTTE said Monday that only 38 of their fighters
had died in the confrontations.
</P>
<P>
Independent confirmation of the casualties is impossible since
the government does not allow journalists to the war zone except
on military-conducted tours.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has intensified in recent weeks ahead of December 21
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Major General Lionel Balagalle said the timing of LTTE's
attacks appeared to be linked to the crucial presidential election
at which President Chandrika Kumaratunga is seeking reelection.
</P>
<P>
LTTE leader Prabhakaran said last month Kumaratunga's five-year
rule is a "curse" to Tamils, indicating his intention to try all
out to bring down the Kumaratunga government.

<HEADLINE> Macao Legislative Assembly Ends Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Sixth Legislative Assembly
of Macao held its last meeting here on Wednesday, indicating that
the legislature of Macao under Portuguese rule has ended its work.
</P>
<P>
The meeting passed a decision endorsing the Chinese versions of
18 laws and decrees adopted previously by the legislature. One
legislator put forward a motion requiring that the Portuguese
government in Lisbon pay the expenses of a Portuguese evening
party here on December 19. The motion was rejected by most
legislators. It has been decided that the cost of the evening
party in question will be borne by the current Portuguese Macao
government.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past three years, members of the Sixth Legislative
Assembly have spent a lot of time dealing with public issues,
thereby rendering their services to Macao and Macao residents with
their own style of work," said Anabela Ritchie, president of the
Legislative Assembly.
</P>
<P>
She said that the legislature had become a place to debate on
issues and safeguard the interests of citizens. She expressed the
belief that the Legislative Council of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) will assume a new outlook and
introduce new ideas.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Assembly of Macao came into being in August of
1976. Beginning from 1990, the legislature consisted of 23 members,
including eight elected directly by Macao voters, eight
recommended by social bodies and seven appointed by the governor
of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The First Legislative Council of the Macao SAR, which came into
being in September this year, has the same number of legislators.
The biggest difference is that seven of its members are appointed
by the chief executive of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Macao SAR legislators are busy discussing bills
vital for a smooth operation of the Macao SAR government. The
bills are expected to be passed on the early morning of December
20 shortly after the establishment of the SAR.

<HEADLINE> Busy Day for Farewell-Bidding Governor of Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- "We know how to build a bridge
of understanding for the future, we know how to link Portugal and
China, and we know how to cherish Macao," Portuguese Governor of
Macao Vasco Rocha Vieira said here today at the final meeting of
the Consultative Council of Macao, an advisory body to the Macao
government.
</P>
<P>
In a Chinese-Portuguese style meeting hall of the Praia Grande
Palace, the governor house, Vieira summed up his tenure over the
past eight-plus years.
</P>
<P>
"We have accomplished the objectives set in the (Sino-
Portuguese) Joint Declaration, built structural conditions for the
modernization of Macao and secured the basis of autonomy for the
Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Today is one of the busiest days for the governor who is
bidding farewell to Macao. In five days, he will return home to
Portugal as China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Macao.
</P>
<P>
As he spoke to the ten members of the Consultative Council and
the seven under-secretaries of the Macao Government, porters were
carrying Governor-Office-sealed cartons of books onto trucks from
the governor house.
</P>
<P>
There is a note of sadness as he recalled that many Portuguese
have left their marks and dreams in Macao and that some even met
the end of their lives here. However, the former general of the
Portuguese army said he will have many happy returns to Macao as a
tourist.
</P>
<P>
Lurdes Maria Da Luz, a staff member who has worked in the
Governor Office for nine years, said that most of the furnishings
in the governor house will remain the same as Vieira leaves the
palace.
</P>
<P>
"We will have a new leader, the first chief executive of the
Macao SAR Ho Hau Wah," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ho Hau Wah, the first head of the Macao SAR government, will be
sworn in on the early morning of December 20. Vieira is reported
to be leaving Macao hours later.
</P>
<P>
Vieira's departure will put a full stop to Western colonial
rule in Asia. However, he has shown personal affections for Macao.
In the Protocol and Public Relations Office of the governor house,
staff members were busying packaging gifts such as bronze plaques
bearing the insignia of the governor house. Most of the gifts are
to be presented to dignitaries from all walks of life in Macao and
friends of the governor.
</P>
<P>
Wendy Cordova Pun Weng U, who has worked with the office for
more than three years, said that staff members have been working
for 15-16 hours a day over the past week.
</P>
<P>
"We will remember these days," she said, "but we are also eager
to see the days ahead."

<HEADLINE> Second Proximity Talks on Cyprus to Be Held in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The second round of U.N.-
sponsored proximity talks on Cyprus is scheduled to be held in
Geneva from January 27 until February 6, 2000, the Cyprus News
Agency (CNA) reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The first round of talks ended on Tuesday in New York under the
U.N. auspices to find a solution for the reunification of the
divided island. Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash were involved in the talks which
started on December 3.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey
 invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in reaction
to a failed coup in Nicosia seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
CNA quoted "reliable sources" as saying that Clerides, leader of
 the Greek Cypriots, left New York satisfied after getting
assurance from the European Union (EU) Helsinki summit that the 15-
nation bloc will not make settlement of the Cyprus issue as a
precondition for Cyprus' accession talks with the EU.
</P>
<P>
He expressed belief that the momentum created by the two-day EU
summit which ended last week will be translated into the
continuation of a new round of proximity talks next year.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU membership in 1990 and started substantive
 accession negotiations with the EU in November 1998. It hopes to
be admitted as an EU member by January 2003.

<HEADLINE> Australian Economy Bounces Back in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Australia's economy bounced
back strongly in the third quarter, 1999, soaring 1.6 percent
seasonally adjusted, the strongest quarterly growth in over two
years, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said that lifted economic growth for the year to
September to 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The strong recovery had been expected after the flat result in
the second quarter when the economy grew just 0.1 percent, revised
down from the original estimate of 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Once again the growth in the economy was driven by domestic
demand, with household consumption growing 1.3 percent seasonally
adjusted in the quarter, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
During the quarter, the country's exports rose 4.2 percent
seasonally adjusted, while imports rose 5.8 percent, meaning trade
was a negative factor in the economy, dragging back the already
high growth by 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Property and business services was the strongest sector of the
economy, followed by retail trade, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture recorded a slight improvement, but not enough to
have an impact, while the construction and government sectors were
the only two to go backwards in the quarter, it said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Home Ownership Campaign Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Housing Developers
Association Malaysia (HDAM) Wednesday described the Home Ownership
Campaign in the country successful with sales exceeding the target.
</P>
<P>
Properties valued at 2.402 billion ringgit (632.105 million U.S.
dollars) were sold during the second Home Ownership Campaign held
between October 29 and December 7, exceeding the target of 2.0
billion ringgit (526.315 million U.S. dollars) that was intimated
to the Ministry of Finance and Bank Negara (State Bank) Malaysia
at the outset of the campaign, HDAM President Eddy Chen Lok Loi
said at a press conference Wednesday in Petaling Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
The number of properties sold was 15,335 units, comprising
mainly medium-cost residential units against a total of 70,135
units of property offered for sale with a combined market value of
10.253 billion ringgit (2.698 billion U.S. dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still leftovers of about 55,000 units which
are expected to be sold in six to nine months' time, he said,
adding that when these units were sold, the target sales of 125,
000 units under the Seventh Malaysia Plan (1996-2000) would be
achieved.
</P>
<P>
He urged developers not to increase the price of the unsold
properties offered during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
He said the HDAM was satisfied with the sales achieved during
the second campaign and was convinced the property market had
stabilized.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia launched its first Home Ownership Campaign at the end
of last year aiming to prop up the demand for properties, during
which properties worth 1.6 billion ringgit (421 million U.S.
dollars) were sold.
</P>
<P>
When the first campaign was launched, the situation featured a
tight credit squeeze, tight monetary policies and slow sales in
view of the economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
The second campaign was targeted to help further ease the
property market overhang under a new scenario, that is, an
economic recovery with a more flexible credit release, lower
interest rates and higher confidence in consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
The HDAM official said the campaigns were successful in
spurring up demand, contributing to more new property launches and
stability in property prices.
</P>
<P>
He said the association continued to urge caution in any new
project launches and suggested that developers carry out proper
market research to ensure that future project launches would be
salable and the oversupply situation experienced in 1997 and 1998
would not recur.
</P>
<P>
The HDAM announced that it had reactivated its Post Campaign
Monitoring Panel chaired by its deputy president Francis Ng Tian
Sang to deal with complaints and problems arising from the second
Home Ownership Campaign.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's transportation
sector such as aviation, maritime and land transport would enter
into the new millennium with Y2K ready operations, Transport
Minister Ling Liong Sik said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
All sub-sectors have already taken and passed key remediation
effort including tests and contingency plans to confirm their
status as Y2K ready, he said at a press conference here..
</P>
<P>
He said that a team from the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) and International Air Transport Association(
IATA) was satisfied with the Y2K work achievement done by the
Department of Civil Aviation (DCA).
</P>
<P>
"MAS (Malaysia Airlines) and its aircraft, Malaysia Airports
Berhad (MAB) and the major ports in Malaysia are now operationally
Y2K ready," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said most of the ports' Y2K contingency plans also
include a period of "no operations" during the critical Y2K
rollover periods, both local and GMT time, ranging from two hours
to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Land transport such as STAR and PUTRA, both light rail
transport, as being new operators, are not much affected because
both started with all Y2K compliant related hardware, software and
equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K test done by KTM (railway operator) and its contractors
also indicate that KTM's commuter trains are Y2K ready and its
ticketing system even had already sold tickets into year 2000, he
said, adding the interstate trains are all diesel powered and will
not be affected by Y2K problem.

BANGKOK, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangkok Bank PLC, Thailand's
largest commercial bank, announced Wednesday it will install IBM
mainframes, a state-of-art storage system and an integrated call
center to offer 24-hour e-business for customers.
</P>
<P>
Chartsiri Sophonpanich, president of the bank, said the new
investments are part of the bank's global vision for banking in
the new millennium, according to a press release of the bank.
</P>
<P>
"We want Bangkok Bank's customers to have the opportunity to
bank anytime, from anywhere by means they are most comfortable
with," he said.
</P>
<P>
The bank need to be "responsive to change, capable of operating
around the clock and truly global" in an environment where new
products and services are announced every day, Chartsiri said.
</P>
<P>
To meet these objectives, the very first thing the bank has to
do is to put in place a robust, comprehensive information
technology infrastructure which will enable their business
strategy, he added.
</P>
<P>
Based on the enterprise storage server which is an all-
inclusive storage solution available for the banking and finance
industries, the new service will offer real-time responses from
customer service representatives, who are on call at all times.
</P>
<P>
The benefits of the new phone banking center are not just those
of reducing costs and staff but rather gained from increased
levels of customer satisfaction and customer service staff no
longer have to be stationed at every branch, the press release
said.
</P>
<P>
The bank claims the system is the largest installment of its
kind in the Asia Pacific region.

CANBERRA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Australia Wednesday agreed to
provide a 80-million-U.S. dollar short-term loan to Papua New
Guinea (PNG) to help with the nation's economic restructuring.

<HEADLINE> Shaoxing Opera "Sisters on Stage" Delights Beijing Audience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- "Sisters on Stage", a Shaoxing
opera produced by the Shanghai Shaoxing Opera Studio, was
performed here yesterday to an enthusiastic Beijing audience.
</P>
<P>
Originating in Shaoxing of east China's Zhejiang Province,
Shaoxing opera is popular in southeast China. The Chinese classic
story "A Dream of Red Mansions" is a masterpiece of Shaoxing opera.
</P>
<P>
Adapted from a film, "Sisters on Stage" is one of the very few
Shaoxing operas staged in Beijing, where Peking opera is the
dominant form. It depicts the bitter experiences of a pair of
sisters in the 1940s who lived on Shaoxing opera.
</P>
<P>
The actresses playing the sisters are best known for their
portrayals of Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu in "A Dream of Red Mansions.
" Their mellow voices delighted the audience, who frequently burst
into applause.
</P>
<P>
Zhengxie Hall, which hosted the performance, was packed; some
of the opera-goers traveled from Shanghai for the show. A number
of people from Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces who now
work in Beijing said they were thrilled with the opera and some
were even moved to tears.
</P>
<P>
Li Na, a member of the Beijing Shaoxing Opera Association (BSOA)
, said, "I was born in Beijing, but I love Shaoxing opera. It's
just beautiful."
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy for Shaoxing opera to gain acceptance in Beijing,
" said Huang Min, chief of the Youth Troupe of BSOA. "However,
Beijing audiences are looking forward to more of it."

<HEADLINE> Scores of Tanzanian Infant Girls Die From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Scores of Tanzanian
infant girls have died from excessive bleeding since perpetrators
of female circumcision began to target toddlers, local media
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some tribes in the central Singida Region of Tanzania, which
are notorious for female circumcision, are using infants to dodge
the law and escape public persecution for performing the medieval
rituals, the independent Guardian newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"Since the rituals of circumcising women are illegal under the
Sexual Offences (Special Provisions) Act of 1998, some people are
now victimizing innocent babies because they can cut off their
external sex organs quietly and with less difficulty," the paper
quoted senior social welfare officer Zuhura Karya as saying.
</P>
<P>
She said a lot of infants could die from such experiences
because the rituals are performed with crude instruments such as
razor blades under unhygienic conditions.
</P>
<P>
There were many unreported cases in the region's remote
villages where girl babies bleed to death after being circumcised,
the officer said.
</P>
<P>
According to Karya, nearly half of the women giving birth in
Singida have been circumcised.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, different ethnic groups had different reasons for
circumcising their women, but the common reason among them is that
they believe an uncircumcised woman was dirty and likely to be
promiscuous.

TOKYO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Japan's four-time world judo
champion Ryoko Tamura has broken her little finger, a critical
injury, in a struggle against archrival Cuban Amarilis Savon.
</P>
<P>
Tamura broke her left hand's little finger when failing to
throw her opponent in the 48-kilogram bantamweight final at the
Fukuoka international women's judo championships on Sunday.
</P>

Little fingers play a pivotal part in grabbing collars or

24-year-old Tamura won the close match on a 3-0 decision to
take her 10th straight bantamweight title in the contest.
</P>
<P>
"I wonder how I managed to fight Savon," Tamura said late
Tuesday after doctors determined that she needed about two months
to heal up the broken pinky.
</P>
<P>
She added that "Judging from X-rays, the muscles seem to be
partly torn also. I need to heal them up completely."

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Drops Duty-Free Privileges for Royal Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein has asked the government to stop waiving custom duties on
cars imported and licensed in the name of the Royal Court.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Prime Minister Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh dated Tuesday,
 Abdullah said all cars licensed under the Royal Court and owned by
 individuals should be subjected to custom duties.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure equality among people, said Abdullah,
necessary measures must be taken to prevent the registration of any
 vehicle for the duty-free benefit for any person or institution
under the name of the Royal Court.
</P>
<P>
The move has been hailed by Jordanian officials as a step in the
 right direction to curb the losses of much-needed fund to the
state treasury.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that some 3,000 duty-free cars are
roaming the Jordanian roads though independent estimates put the
figure at 10,000, most of them are luxurious cars owned by former
officials and tribal leaders.
</P>
<P>
Car dealers said the average duties for the top-class high
petrol-consuming cars ran at about 10,000 Jordanian dinars (14,000
U.S. dollars), meaning the state treasury may lose up to 100
million dinars (140 million dollars) due to inappropriate duty
waivers.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom can not manufacture cars and most of the cars in use
 are imported from Germany, the United States, Japan, France and
South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Technical Arrangement About Ethio-Eritrean War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi has reiterated that the United States proposed
technical arrangement to solve Ethio-Eritrean conflict is not
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
In a briefing to African ambassadors Tuesday, Meles said
"Ethiopia has bent backwards with the U.S./Rwanda proposals and
has bent more with the framework agreement, bending any further
would break our back and we are not ready to do that."
</P>
<P>
Meles criticized the technical arrangement for its failure to
guarantee the fundamental principle of international law.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the high price that Ethiopia paid to
achieve the return to the status quo anti is primarily not for
land but is for principle.
</P>
<P>
Any head of state cannot force Ethiopia to change the
principle, he insisted.
</P>
<P>
Meles said Ethiopia will remain committed to the letter and
spirit of the two basic documents -- the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) proposed pace package and the modalities for its
implementation.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the technical arrangement could be worked out
in such a way as to be consistent with the two fundamental
documents and the principles contained therein." he said.
</P>
<P>
Meles said Ethiopia appreciated the stand taken by African
countries which, he said, were consistent with the OAU Charter,
international laws and principles governing inter-state relations.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea have been at war since May 1998, since
which tens of thousands people have been killed and injured in the
battles.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wholesale Network Services Market to Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 14 (Xinhua) -- A report released Tuesday
projects that the U.S. wholesale network services market will grow
at an average annual rate of 24 percent in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The market, driven primarily by Internet Protocol (IP) related
wholesale volume, is expected to reach 116 billion U.S. dollars in
revenue by 2003, up from 39 billion dollars in 1998, according to
the report from research and consulting firm Phillips Group.
</P>
<P>
The report said three key sectors account for increases in IP
related wholesale volumes.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of wireless wholesale services, driven by
Internet access, will jump from 500 million dollars in 1998 to 5.5
billion dollars in 2003, expanding 11 times.
</P>
<P>
The second biggest IP wholesale growth rate will be among new
entrants to the industry, known as competitive local exchange
carriers. These firms posted total wholesale revenues of 250
million dollars in 1998 and in five years, their revenues are
expected to multiply 10-fold, to 2.62 billion dollars in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, revenues of packet/cell-based network service providers,
which include the delivery of IP telephony, will jump from 2
billion dollars in 1998 to 20.4 billion dollars in 2003.
</P>
<P>
There are three key drivers in the U.S. wholesale network
service market, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The initial driver is the impact of ongoing deregulation of the
telecom environment and the growth in competition that it has
generated. The second driver has been the rapid acceleration of
telecom technologies, particularly fiber optic transmission and
switching capabilities that are resulting in the doubling of
bandwidth capabilities every nine months. The third driver has
been the impact of the Internet on the demand for bandwidth and
the transformation of bandwidth usage from circuit-switched voice
to IP packet networks.

<HEADLINE> Radical Ethnic Group Behind Attack on Nigeria's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Lagos State Police
said on Tuesday that eight suspects arrested so far in connection
with the attack upon the state's Governor Ahmed Tinubu are
members of the Oodua People's Congress (OPC), which was behind
last month's Lagos ethnic conflict in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
The New Nigerian newspaper Wednesday quoted Mike Okiro, the
state's police chief, as saying that one of those arrested is a
top OPC member, a radical Yoruba ethnic group, which fought with
the immigrant Ijaws in an ethnic clash last month, which killed
about 100 people in Lagos, Nigeria's biggest city.
</P>
<P>
The attack upon the governor occurred on Sunday afternoon in an
area near the governor's official residency, when the governor's
convoy was blocked by seven commercial vehicles occupied by about
20 attackers.
</P>
<P>
Describing the experience as a "frightening one", Governor
Tinubu said Monday that a bullet penetrated his car and several
of this security men were badly injured during the incident.
</P>
<P>
In fighting back, the governor's security men killed four
attackers and arrested five at the scene. The state's police said
they were investigating on the motives behind the attack.
</P>
<P>
Following the attack, Tinubu and the state's legislature Monday
renewed their calls for a state controlled police force, which
the federal government did not approve several month ago.

BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Mainlanders looking for jobs
in Hong Kong can expect their applications to be reviewed starting
January 1, 2000, the Ministry of Public Security announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
A senior police officer from the ministry's Exit and Entry

permits to those who are hired, as well as to their spouses and
children under age 21.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the Exit and Entry Administration has
formulated a regulation on the approval of mainlanders seeking job
opportunities in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, the applicants should have the
permits issued by the SAR's entry department, and job seekers
should get the approval from their mainland employers before they
can submit application forms to their local public security
bureaus.

of refugees, Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Mutawakil
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press of Pakistan quoted Mutawakil as saying in
an interview with BBC Wednesday that during the visit talks on

<P>
No talks other than this has taken place, he said.
</P>
<P>

which sectors and areas they want to invest, he said that this is
an attempt by the public.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's state-run Bank for
Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) will extend loans
to Thai citizens wishing to work overseas, Thailand News Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
BAAC President Pitayapol Nath-tharadol was quoted as saying
that approved applicants would be given a maximum loan of 150,000
baht(3947 U.S. dollars) each with an annual interest rate of 10.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, to be taken effect in January next year, was a
cooperative project between BAAC and the Ministry of Labor and
Social Welfare, he said.
</P>
<P>
Those applying for loans of no more than 90,000 baht (2368
dollars) would only pay an annual interest rate of 7.5 percent
while the rest of three percent would be shouldered by the
Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare.
</P>
<P>
Applicants of loans over 90,000 baht, however, would pay the
full interest rate of 10.5 percent only for the over-set-
privileged amount, Pitayapol said.
</P>
<P>
Borrowers could also make periodic repayments of their loans in
accordance with varied periods of their employment by overseas
firms, he said.

DAR ES SALAAM, December 15 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 160,000
people in the central Singida Region of Tanzania are in need of
emergency food aid as a prolonged dry spell hit half of the
villages in this semi-arid area.
</P>
<P>
The independent Guardian newspaper Wednesday quoted Acting
Singida Regional Commissioner Martin Mgongolwa as saying that more
than 156,000 people in the region need emergency food aid from
this month to next April.
</P>
<P>
"This year's survey of the food situation in Singida shows that
there's an acute shortage of 9,500 tons of food," the commissioner
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the majority of those in need of food aid in the region
are people who do not have food reserves, livestock or employment
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"An accumulation of adverse weather effects from last year to
this year resulted in the food deficit in many parts of the
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Regional Commissioner's Office has intervened in
the alarming food situation by encouraging farmers to cultivate
drought resistant crops.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is expected to face a shortage of 600,000 tons of food
next year due to bad weather in various parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Complete Bank Recapitalization by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
would complete its banking reorganization and recapitalization
program of all of state banks by June 2000, a senior minister said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to completing the reorganization and
recapitalization of all of the state banks by June 2000 and at the
same time we plan to complete the reorganization and consolidation
of the banks taken-over by government (BTO) and the liquidated
banks by September of next year," Coordinating Minister for
Economy, Finance and Industry Kwik Kian Gie said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would move forward with a vigorous
program to privatize the banking system.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to begin the privatization process by selling part
of the government stake in Bank Central Asia (BCA) by February
2000," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
BCA is the country's largest private bank. The bank now has
been under control of government as it failed to meet the capital
adequate ratio (CAR) requirements of 4 percent as stipulated by
the new law of banking.
</P>
<P>
The government would then proceed with majority divestment of
key state banks and BTO banks, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, the
Indonesian government closed 16 commercial banks found unhealthy
in November 1997. On April 4 last year, the government froze the
operation of seven private banks and put seven others under the
supervision of the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency. Four
month later, the government froze the operation of three banks and
took over the ownership of four other banks.
</P>
<P>
In March 1999, government had closed down 38 private banks
while putting seven others under government management.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Calls for U.N. Policy to Iron out Differences with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) has called
on the United Nations Security Council to work out a new policy on
the U.N.-Iraqi relations in a bid to iron out differences and
execute the relevant resolutions, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The AL said in a statement issued by its secretariat general on
Tuesday that it has been closely following up the consultations
underway in the U.N. Security Council on formulating new ways of
dealing with the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
The 22-nation pan-Arab organization demanded the council to make
 positive reaction to Iraq's readiness to cooperate with the U.N.
if a proper policy is worked out by the world organization.
</P>
<P>
"This new policy should give Baghdad hope that there is light at
 the end of the tunnel," the AL statement said, quoted by the
paper.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council is considering vote on a draft
resolution proposed by Britain on suspension of international trade
 sanctions on Iraq after it is certified to have cooperated with
the U.N. under a new regime for weapons verification in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has rejected the British proposal, insisting that it has
fully carried out its commitments and the U.N. Security Council
should lift the sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The AL expressed appreciation for the endeavors aimed at easing
the sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council approved last Friday a six-month
extension to the humanitarian oil-for-food program in Iraq after
weeks of haggling about the future policy toward Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The program offers an exception to the crippling U.N. economic
sanctions. It allows Iraq to export 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth
of oil in six months to buy food and medicine for the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Won't Ask Debt Butchering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 15, (Xinhua) -- Indonesia would not ask hair
cut but debt rescheduling to donor countries or international
institutions, a senior official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will just ask for a rescheduling of our debt, but not hair
cut. We will reduce the total of our debt with reducing the number
of
financial aids (from donor countries), not asking hair cut,"
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry Kwik Kian
Gie told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the country would not ask debt butchering as such a
move would just endanger the Indonesian economy as the
international donors would no longer give their financial
assistance.
</P>
<P>
"If we asked for hair cut, we will be isolated by international
community. And cash inflow into Indonesia will be halted and the
people of Indonesia will undergo an extraordinary torment," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Donor countries grouped in the Consultative Group for Indonesia
(CGI) is expected to hold its first meeting in Jakarta on February
1-2, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Asked how much financial aid would be proposed to the donors,
Kwik Kian Gie refused to comment, saying it has still been under
calculation.
</P>
<P>
"But We will be proud if the commitment (of financial aid) from
CGI would be smaller than the previous commitment," he said.

<HEADLINE> Agreement Signed on Nuclear Reactor Construction in DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Korean Peninsula Energy
Development Organization (KEDO) and the Korea Electric Power Corp.
(KEPCO) signed an agreement Wednesday here for the construction of
two light-water reactors in the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by KEDO Executive Director Desaiz
Anderson and KEPCO President Choi Soo-byong, with more than 80
celebrities, including the ambassadors of the 12 KEDO member
states, attending the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, comprised of 38 articles and 22 appendices,
stipulates the duties of the KEPCO, KEDO and the DPRK for the
construction of the two reactors.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, KEPCO will build the two light-water
reactors, install and manage fundamental facilities, while KEDO is
responsible for supplying a work site, communication facilities
and securing workers' safety.
</P>
<P>
The two light-water reactors with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts
each will be built in Kumho, an eastern coastal area of the DPRK's
Hamyong Province, at a cost of 4.6 billion U.S. dollars, of which
South Korea will provide 32.2 billion, Japan 10 billion and the
United States the rest.
</P>
<P>
It will take eight and nine years to complete the construction
of the two reactors respectively.
</P>
<P>
Some 220 South Korean engineers from KEPCO, Hyundai, Daewoo and
Korea Heavy Industries have finished preliminary projects such as
ground-leveling and infrastructure in Kumho.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the DPRK signed an agreement in Geneva in
October 1994 to build the reactors in return for Pyongyang's
abandonment of its suspected nuclear development.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Geneva agreement, the construction of
the reactors would be completed and put into operation in 2003.
However, the deadline has to be postponed to 2007 or 2008.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang has complained about the slow pace of the
construction, even threatening to scrap the 1994 agreement.

<HEADLINE> Securities Association of China Restructured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Securities Association of
China (SAC) today held its members' conference here, marking the
end of the SAC's restructuring which started in September.
</P>
<P>
Ma Qingquan, deputy chief of the SAC restructuring working
group, said the new SAC's major task is to assist the China
Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) in educating and
supervising its members in implementing securities laws and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
It will protect member's interests according to law and
providing information services to members. The SAC is also to
promote international exchanges and personnel training in the
securities sector.
</P>
<P>
And it will promote the research of the securities market, Ma
said.
</P>
<P>
The SAC was founded in 1991, shortly after the securities
market came into existence in China.
</P>
<P>
With the Securities Law of China taking effect in July this
year, the SAC faces the imminent adjustment of its role and legal
position, for which the SAC restructuring working group was set up
by the CSRC, which oversees the securities and futures industries
of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to SAC sources, the most important changes in the
association are that it is clearly-defined by the Securities Law
as a self-disciplined organization of securities firms and has an
important role in regulating the market. In the past, the SAC's
work focused on services for members.
</P>
<P>
In its two-day meeting, the conference will discuss and approve
the constitution and membership regulations of the new SAC as well
as its work report.
</P>
<P>
The conference will also elect the leadership of the SAC.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of 141 member firms are attending.

MSAR) Government," she said, "to carry out the policies of 'one
country, two systems' and 'Macao people administering Macao'."
</P>
<P>
There are at present 18,000 public servants in Macao, who have
generally remained calm, though certain changes in the framework
of the government are expected to take place after December 20.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Question of Macao,
which was signed 12 years ago, states that, for 50 years after the
handover, Macao's previous social and economic system and way of
life will remain unchanged and that Macao's existing laws will
remain basically unchanged. The commitment is enshrined in the
Basic Law of the MSAR enacted by the National People's Congress
six years later.
</P>
<P>
Macao has remained calm and stable for the past 12 years, the
transitional period for the region before it reverts to Chinese
rule.
</P>
<P>
At the same time when the Portuguese Macao Government and
Legislative Assembly have remained operational, the MSAR
Government and Legislative Council have been established. All
previous public servants, lawmakers and judges in Macao who are
eligible in accordance with the Basic Law may hold their positions
if they so wish. All previous laws in Macao that do not contravene
the Basic Law will become laws of the MSAR and remain effective in
post-handover Macao.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the smooth transition, local residents have kept
their lifestyle unaffected for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, people flock to parks to do exercises, or go
shopping at food markets. In the evening, casinos are filled with
people seeking instant riches. U Kin Lung, a young student
returning home from his Australian university for holidays, says
what has impressed him most is that everything is orderly in Macao
and nothing has changed in the way of life.
</P>
<P>
Local businessmen do not want to miss opportunities created by
Macao's handover. Victor Leung, a local entrepreneur, says he
plans to expand his garment factory by moving it to Coloane Island.
</P>
<P>
In the Macau Polytechnic Institute, students stay late into the
night in lecture rooms. Many young people, including Macanese, or
locally-born Portuguese, are busy learning Chinese in the hope of
finding better jobs in the future.

<HEADLINE> 11 Laws to Be Finalized in Macao Prior to Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Legislative Council of the
Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) will finish deliberating
and finalizing the 11 essential laws for the Macao SAR and one set
of principles governing the operations of the Legislative Council
by December 18, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Macao SAR Legislative Council finished discussing and
finalizing the law governing the permanent Macao SAR residents and
the right of abode, and the Organic Law of Judicial System of
Macao at its plenary meeting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The first 43 articles of the 115-article General Rules on Macao
Judges were also discussed and finalized at the Macao SAR
Legislative Council meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lau Cheok Va, vice-president of the Macao SAR Legislative
Council, said that they had long deliberations about two major
issues of the Organic Law of Judicial System of Macao, namely, the
vacation of the judges and the establishment of two offices.
</P>
<P>
The annual two-month vacation of Macao judges will be shortened
to one month after Macao's return in order to quicken the handling
of civil cases. Legislators also agreed to the establishment of
the offices of the procurator and of the president of the Court of
Final Appeal, which would be responsible for handling routine
affairs of the courts and procuratorate of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The deliberations about the General Rules on Macao Judges are
mainly centered on the part-time job of Macao judges, said Lau.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law of the Macao SAR, a Macao SAR judge
shall not concurrently have a second job in any public or private
organizations nor shall have any job in political organizations
during his or her term of office.
</P>
<P>
Legislators held that if necessary, Macao judges may
concurrently take up a job as a law professor, undertake legal
training or research with the approval of the judges committee and
the procurator-general.

<HEADLINE> Reclamation No Longer Disturbs Birds' Paradise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- For half a century, hundreds of
thousands of demobilized soldiers and urban youngsters have worked
to reclaim wasteland in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province,
but their crusade has come to an end.
</P>
<P>
The central government has made the decision to stop reclaiming
the wasteland, known as the "Great Northern Wildness," to save an
ever-shrinking habitat for water birds.
</P>
<P>
The wilderness, bordering Russia, annually turns out 6.5
million tons of grain, an amount which is able to feed the
citizens of Hong Kong and Macao for four years. China started to
send people to the fertile but cold region five decades ago to
solve its food problem.
</P>
<P>
In the wilderness, one of the three major black soil belts in
the world, China cultivated two million hectares of farmland with
agricultural machinery -- more than anywhere else in the country --
making it a giant grain base.
</P>
<P>
As the reclamation area becomes larger and larger, the size of
wetlands there has shrunk by 60 percent, forcing red-crowned
cranes, white storks and other water fowl on the verge of
extinction to fly elsewhere to survive.
</P>
<P>
With a network of rivers, swamps and dense forests, the
wetlands have been put on an international wetlands protection
list.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, wildlife experts have appealed to the
government to stop encroaching on the Great Northern Wilderness.
Liu Xingtu, deputy director of the Wetlands Research Center of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, warned that "the wetlands will
disappear in a dozen years if no effective measures are taken."
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Chinese government finally announced it would
stop further reclaiming the Great Northern Wilderness and instead
set up nature reserves and plant trees to improve the local
ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhicai, deputy director of the Agricultural Reclamation
Bureau under the Ministry of Agriculture, said that although
further reclamation has been stopped, the status of the Great
Northern Wilderness as a major grain base remains unaffected.
</P>
<P>
Wang explained that with the help of science and technology,
the grain output of the wilderness will not drop; in fact, the
already reclaimed area will provide more and better grain for
China.
</P>
<P>
Shen Liguo, an official in charge of the Great Northern
Wilderness reclamation, said that emphasis will be placed on the
improvement of the species of agricultural crops and their unit
yield.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are being made to reform over one million hectares of
low- and medium-yield farmland, a move which is meant to attain an
additional 2.5 million tons of grain annually, he added.
</P>
<P>
Shen put this year's grain output in the Great Northern
Wilderness at a record high of nine million tons. "But not a
single granule of grain came from any new plots of land," he said.

<HEADLINE> Macao SAR Passport Recognized Internationally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The passport of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (MSAR), which is to be established
on December 20, has won recognition by a number of countries
including the United States, Myanmar, Japan, France and Canada,
since samples of the MSAR passport and travel document were
announced last August.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Korea and some other countries have recently
announced their recognition of the MSAR passport, and some
countries are known to consider granting visa-free treatment to
bearers of the MSAR passport, according to Macao Identification
Services.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, however, has not yet made an official statement about
its recognition of the MSAR passport, although it once expressed
its intention to be the first country to grant visa-free treatment
to holders of the passport.
</P>
<P>
Portugal's lukewarm response has the public here concerned and
has also brought about inconveniences to MSAR passport holders,
some of whom will travel to Portugal and western Europe during
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
Last week, relevant governmental departments of Hong Kong and
Macao announced entry arrangements for Hong Kong and Macao
residents traveling between the two regions after Macao's return
to China on December 20.
</P>
<P>
The MSAR government will issue a Hong Kong travel permit for
Macao residents, who are not to use the MSAR passport as a travel
document for Hong Kong, according to Macao Identification Services.
</P>
<P>
Of late, Macao Identification Services receives some 300 to 400
MSAR passport applicants every day, and nearly 90 percent of
applicants having made an appointment in advance have also been to
offices of the Services to go through application procedures,
according to the Services.

<HEADLINE> Macao Residents Eager to Greet PLA Garrison Troops (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- These days, 78-year-old Ho
Cheong Po has kept asking the local community association to let
him join the well-wishers who are to greet the garrison troops of
the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) to Macao.
</P>
<P>
Ho's requests were turned down by the Residents Mutual
Assistance Association of the Chou Toi 6 Streets earlier because
of his old age. However, the old man has never given up.
</P>
<P>
"Macao will soon return to the embrace of the motherland. This
is an unprecedented event, and we Chinese here will become masters
of our own destiny. I am so happy and excited," the old man said,
adding that he must do something for the arrival of the garrison
troops who symbolize the sovereignty of China.
</P>
<P>
Ho is one of the numerous local residents who are eager to join
the 20,000-strong welcoming crowd who are to line the streets to
greet the incoming soldiers.
</P>
<P>
According to the Federation of Macao Neighborhood Associations,
the largest of its kind in Macao, more than 3,000 members of the
local neighborhood associations are expected to join the well-
wishers organized by all circles of the region.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Chou Toi 6 Streets Association, which the 78-
year old man belongs to, held a special meeting for the upcoming
handover and the arrival of the garrison troops. They decided to
hang banners and make miniature-flags on December 15, hang Chinese
national flags on December 17, and hang flags of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR) on the early morning of December 20.

<HEADLINE> Macao Residents Eager to Greet PLA Garrison Troops (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kong Kam Van, a 77-year-old woman who has been president of the
association for a dozen years, disclosed that her 16-member team
will welcome the PLA garrison troops with banners, miniature
national flags, and floral rings.
</P>
<P>
As one of the 25 members of the Federation of Macao
Neighborhood Associations, the Chou Toi 6 Street Association has
been a patriotic body ever since it was founded in the 1960s. In
recent years, the association has held a series of lectures on the
Basic Law of the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
Being a Chinese and Macao resident, Kong said she feels very
happy for Macao's upcoming return to the motherland because it
marks an end to foreign rule on the Chinese soil. All these should
be attributed to the prosperity and mightiness of the motherland,
she stressed.
</P>
<P>
To station the garrison troops in Macao has been up to the
aspirations of local residents, Kong said, noting that her
neighbors are very much impressed by the reports on the good
behavior of the PLA garrison troops in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The PLA garrison troops will be a deterrent force in
maintaining social order in Macao, though they will not be
directly involved in local security work, Kong said. That's why
local residents are eager to see their presence here, she added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the future MSAR Government headed by Chief
Executive Edmund Ho Hau Wah, the old lady said she is confident of
this young, energetic and well-educated man. The MSAR Government
has won wide support from local residents and is capable of
improving the economy and building a better Macao, she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
constituted a National Science and Technology Council to
coordinate, monitor and promote science and technology in the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to Wednesday's Zambia Daily Mail newspaper, the
existing barrier between the scientists and the residents has
contributed greatly to the economic degradation in the African
country.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Acting Technical Education and Vocational
Training Minister David Saviye as saying here on Tuesday that
there are abundant resources in the country but there is little
utilization of them.
</P>
<P>
He called on stakeholders to come up with a science
agenda-framework to address the socio-economic challenges
besetting the country.
</P>
<P>
To address the challenges, there is urgent need to reform the
current scientific and technological programs, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said stakeholders must re-examine the possibilities of
incorporating science into the policy-making process.
</P>
<P>
Saviye noted that science includes the improvement of
infrastructure like telecommunication facilities which have a
direct link on the utilization of local and foreign resources to
improve the economy.
</P>
<P>
Should these be improved by scientists and information imparted
to non- technical users, the country may attain the desired social
and economic development, he said.

<HEADLINE> Deputy PM to Lead Lebanon's Team for Talks with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 15 (Xinhua) -- In a surprise announcement,
Lebanese Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Michel Murr
has disclosed that he would head Lebanon's team for peace
negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"I was asked to head the team because I'm entitled to be the
acting foreign minister,"Murr was quoted by the Daily Star
newspaper as saying on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A source close to Prime Minister Salim Hoss said that Hoss
decided not to lead the team himself "because his main job is the
premiership and because the Lebanese-Israeli talks will proceed in
most stages at the level of diplomats."
</P>
<P>
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the paper
that "the government doesn't expect Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak to head his country's delegations to the talks with Lebanon.
Therefore, there is no need for Hoss to head Lebanon's team in the
talks."
</P>
<P>
The remarks came as Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa was
 to meet in Washington Wednesday with Barak for landmark
negotiations aimed at ending a half-century of hostilities between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Murr said the date for the resumption of the Lebanese-Israeli
talks has not been set but will come soon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with declared aim to stop cross-border attacks by Lebanese
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has been demanding an unconditional Israeli withdrawal
from its territory.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Refrigerator Earns Subsidy from German Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Officials with China's Haier
Group recently received a fax from their franchisers in Europe
saying that a consumer can get a government environmental subsidy
of 50 to 100 deutsche marks (30 to 60 U.S. dollars) when buying a
Haier refrigerator in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The fax said this is because Haier refrigerator have met the
highest standard of energy consumption in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Haier Group, with headquarters in the scenic port city of
Qingdao in Shandong Province, east China, is the country's leading
producer of household electrical appliance. It has been making
freon-free and energy-saving refrigerators. In 1993, Haier
produced China's first completely freon-free refrigerator, which
also can save more than 40 percent of electricity use.
</P>
<P>
Haier refrigerators now sell well at the European market, which
is famous for its severe product requirements, and the group has
become the largest exporter of refrigerators to Germany. In the
United States, Hair has gained more than 20 percent of the market
of under-180-liter refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
Haier now sells products to some 80 countries and has set up
over 30,000 sales offices worldwide. In the first ten months of
this year, the company's total exports increased by 138 percent
over the same period of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Inflation Drops by Nine Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 15 (Xinhua)-- Zimbabwe's year-on-year rate of
inflation in November took a surprising turn, dropping by 9.2
percent to 61. 2 percent from a record 70.4 percent, the country's
Central Statistical office said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Food inflation lost 17 percentage points over the October rate
of 86.4 percent to 69.4 percent while non-food inflation stood at
55.6 percent, shedding 4.1 percent from the October rate of 59.7
percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The decrease in inflation to 61.2 percent from 70.4 percent in
October, 1999 is largely explained by the rapid increase in
November's month-on month inflation last year by nine percent
compared with 3.1 percent this year during the same period," the
office said.
</P>
<P>
According to economic analyst Andy Hodges, the country's
inflation seems to have peaked and could start to decline in the
coming year if all unforeseeable factors are discounted.

<HEADLINE> Maps of Japanese Invasion Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The four maps found in the
archives of a coal mine in Luoyang City of Henan Province, central
China, have been confirmed as being military maps used by Japanese
aggressors when they occupied the area in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
The maps, all classified as "top military confidential," were
found as workers were clearing up documents in the old Longmen
Mine archive.
</P>
<P>
According to Liang Yuting, head of the archive, the four maps
show details of two major Henan Province cities, Kaifeng and
Luoyang, including rivers and mountains, and streets, buildings
and village routes.
</P>
<P>
The four maps were apparently drawn in the early 1930s, Liang
said, adding that this shows that the Japanese imperialists had
planned aggression against China years before 1937, when the War
of Resistance Against Japan began.
</P>
<P>
When they eventually invaded Luoyang in 1944, the Japanese
first occupied the strategic site of the Longmen Mine and looted
the coal resources there. The maps are believed to have been left
by the Japanese invaders when they retreated prior to their
surrender in 1945, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Better Food Supply Guaranteed in Macao After Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- By 7 a.m. every morning,
truckloads of live pigs, cattle, poultry and fresh vegetables
converge at the Gongbei Customs checkpoint of Zhuhai, the nearest
mainland city to Macao.
</P>
<P>
Many of the trucks bear the emblem of Doumen Foodstuffs Import
and Export Corporation of Zhuhai, which operates many production
bases that specialize in providing non-staple food supplies to
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yifan, deputy general manager of Doumen, said his company
has been responsible for bringing market supplies in Macao for
years, and all the livestock and vegetables they haul are
carefully tended.
</P>
<P>
"We will introduce stricter quality control standards to
produce more high-quality non-staple foodstuffs so that residents
of Macao will have greater choices for better food after the
handover on December 20," said Yang.
</P>
<P>
For example, to provide Macao with top-quality pigs and prevent
spread of disease, Doumen workers are asked to don boots and wade
through a pool of disinfectant before entering the pig-breeding
area, where 1,000 head of 90-kg lean pigs are waiting to be loaded
into trucks and shipped to Macao.
</P>
<P>
An official at the chicken farm said they have taken
precautions so that no shipments of underweight or overweight
chickens enter the Macao market. The chickens they now supply to
Macao are raised in a natural environment, which are believed by
Macao residents to be tastier than those chickens raised in cages,
said the official.
</P>
<P>
"Our purpose is to let compatriots of Macao eat well," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
At an 80-hectare vegetable growing farmland, the deputy general
manager said local vegetable farmers rise at four o'clock in the
morning to pick vegetables so that fresh choices will be available
at a major commodity wholesale market in Macao by 7:30 a.m.
Ordinary residents of Macao will be able to buy fresh vegetables
by eight o'clock.
</P>
<P>
According to the deputy general manager, his company supplied
Macao with 8,000 head of live pigs, 337,000 live poultry, 150 head
of cattle, as well as 1,500 tons of fresh vegetables in the first
11 months of the year.

<HEADLINE> UAE to Draft Building Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Public Works
and Housing in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is working on framing
 a federal building law, which is to be the key to sustaining
future growth in the country's construction sector.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry has been apprised of the long-standing demand of
the building sector for a federal law in this field, and steps have
 been taken to come up with a solution, according to senior
industry sources.
</P>
<P>
Currently only the emirate of Dubai has laws related to
construction and there is an increasing need for a UAE-wide
implementation of a building code, said Ahmed Saif Belhasa,
chairman of UAE Contractors Association and president of the World
Organization of Building Officials, quoted by the Gulf News daily
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The UAE's construction sector is worth 20 billion dirhams (about
 5.46 billion U.S. dollars) a year, and the absence of a federal
law is a major problem for the industry now, Belhasa said.
</P>
<P>
"Things are cooking, though we are not sure as to when we can
expect definite results on the building law," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sector is pushing for the creation of an
authoritative body, which will enforce the regulations once they
are passed into law, Belhasa said.

<HEADLINE> China Hosts Seminar on Forestry Development, Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- An international seminar
started here today to discuss the growth and fund raising issues
facing China's forestry industry under the market economy and
outline the development strategy for the future.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar is co-sponsored by the China Development
Bank (CDB), the State Administration of Forestry (SAF) and the
World Bank (WB).
</P>
<P>
Chen Yuan, president of CDB, said that as a policy bank, CDB
provides loans to support the country's key projects in
infrastructure, basic and pillar industries. Its total amount of
loans has hit more than 600 billion yuan (72 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said that previously, CDB's funds in forestry were mainly
used in exploiting natural forests. But in the coming years, the
bank will focus on building large and fast-growing forest
conservation projects and protecting natural forests, in line with
the country's "Natural Forest Projects in Selected Areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, one of the earliest to back China's forestry
industry, has injected 800 million U.S. dollars into six large
forestry projects over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Juergen Voegele, acting head of the WB residential office in
Beijing, said that WB is willing to "establish a new partnership"
with China to help solve new problems that emerge in the forestry
industry's transformation period.
</P>
<P>
He said that WB will do its utmost to provide China with needed
funds, technological assistance and related consultation services.
</P>
<P>
China's forestry industry has made considerable achievements in
the past two decades since the opening-up policy began. Its
forestation coverage ratio rose from 12 percent to the current 13.
92 percent. The figure is expected to reach 18.2 percent in 2005,
and 19 percent in 2010, according to an official with the SAF.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, said SAF's Director Wang Zhibao, China has
worked out its 21st-century-oriented development strategy that
focuses on promoting local development, readjusting the economic
structure and pushing forward modern forestry construction.

<P>
MACAO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Smooth traffic is guaranteed
days around Macao's return to China on December 20, despite the
imposition of traffic restrictions in some areas, a local
transport official said.
</P>
<P>
Can Feng Li, sub-director of the Macao Land, Public Works and
Transport Service, told Xinhua today that Macao's transport
capacity can fully meet traffic needs despite the temporary
imposition of traffic restrictions in some sections of roads and
around areas adjacent to the venues for the ceremonies for the
handover and the establishment of the Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR) and relevant celebration activities.
</P>
<P>
Traffic restrictions are imposed on a larger area every year
during the annual Macao car racing, and yet Macao enjoys smooth
traffic, the official said, adding that there won't be large
numbers of vehicles coming into Macao around Macao's return.
</P>
<P>
More traffic lights have been added for the sake of the
upcoming celebration activities, he said, hoping local residents
would go to their nearby places on foot instead of driving cars on
December 19-21.
</P>
<P>
Macao has more than 50,000 vehicles, but has fewer traffic jams
than in Beijing and Shanghai.

MACAO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Maria Antonia Nicolau Espaninha,
a Portuguese professor in Macao, will spend the coming Christmas
here as she has done in the last five years. If there is any
difference, it is that Macao will be six days into Chinese rule
when she celebrates the holiday with her family.
</P>
<P>
China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Macao on
December 20.
</P>
<P>
Her daughter will fly to Macao from Portugal and her son hates
to leave Macao. Maria and her children choose to celebrate the
most important western holiday in Macao.
</P>
<P>
"It is both special and normal," said Espadinha, director of
the Institute of Portuguese Studies of the University of Macao,for
whom December 25 will be the first post-handover Christmas.
</P>
<P>
Espadinha said she would go to church on Christmas Eve and then
prepare Christmas dinner for the family. She would also invite
some colleagues to join in the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
"It is very harmonious and beautiful for people to sing in
chorus in Chinese and Portuguese or English," she said. "I like to
spend Christmas at home, and I feel Macao is my home now."
</P>

<P>
She said Macao's return to China is an established fact, which
all people have acknowledged. "You choose either to stay or leave,
" she said. "I've chosen to stay."
</P>
<P>
Espadinha believed that there will be some changes after
Macao's return. For an educational institution such as the
university where she works, she said, teaching and learning has to
face constant changes. One change being planned by her Institute
is to offer a new course of comparative Sino-Portuguese studies to
"help people know more about the other".
</P>
<P>
"I think Macao is a very good place for this," she said, "
because it is here that two cultures meet."

<HEADLINE> Macao's Education to Continue Linking Chinese, Western Civilizations (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the eyes of professor Donald W. Cruickshank from the United
States, the University of Macao is rather small with some 3,000
students.
</P>
<P>
"This is a local university with an international focus," said
Cruickshank, associate dean of the Department of Social Sciences
and Humanities of the university. "The university is a unique
educational institution in Asia since it mixes Chinese culture
with Western culture."
</P>
<P>
"It is very important for the university to attract students,
scholars and speakers from many cultures," he said. "That also
makes an important component in the bridge between China and
Europe."
</P>
<P>
Both professors believe that academic freedom in Macao will not
be affected in the future.
</P>
<P>
Agreed historian William Bruce Guthrie, also a faculty member
of the university: "I cannot imagine such freedom ever affected at
all. This is an international university."
</P>
<P>
Guthrie said that academic freedom and freedom of speech are a
basic condition that makes a university competitive
internationally.
</P>
<P>
"Macao is a much more important place historically than people
in the east and west know," said Guthrie, adding that Macao has
been playing the role of a bridge linking the east and west.
Modern education was introduced to China right from Macao, he said.
</P>
<P>
Macao is home to the first Western-style college in Asia. The
University of St. Paul established here 400 years ago offered
courses such as theology, mathematics, astronomy and philosophy.
Clergymen from the west who received education here played an
important role in the fusion of Chinese and Western cultures.
</P>
<P>
The birth of East Asia University in 1981 ended Macao's history
without an institution of higher education.
</P>
<P>
The university was renamed University of Macao in 1991 with
students from Macao, Hong Kong, the Chinese mainland, Southeast
Asia and Africa.

<HEADLINE> New Coal Bed Methane Structure Found in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists said today
that they have found rich coal bed methane resources in an area of
1,700 square kilometers in southeastern Shanxi Province, north
China.
</P>
<P>
The proven reserve there is more than 47 billion cubic meters,
and the ultimate reserve may be more than 400 billion cubic meters,
according to the China National Petroleum Corporation.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest coal bed methane field ever found in China,
said an official with the corporation, which has been prospecting
for the gas resources in northern China in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Coal bed methane is a kind of clean energy that can be used for
cooking, power generation, and automobile fuel. It produces no
smog when burning, and its emissions of dioxide sulfur is lower
than that of coal.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Chinese engineers dug the first experimental well in
Shanxi, which gushed 4,000 cubic meters of the gas a day, and five
more experimental wells were dug near the first well earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
China has rich coal bed methane resources which can be utilized
as a new energy supplementing or replacing coal, petroleum, and
natural gas. Shanxi, one of the leading coal producers in China,
has one-seventh of the coal bed methane resources in the country.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Gives Ultimatum to Probe Helicopters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's parliamentary
committee on defense and internal affairs has given State
Minister for Defense Steven Kavuma a three-month ultimatum to give
a report on the helicopters rejected by the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made Tuesday at the committee's meeting also
attended by the ministry's Permanent Secretary Ben Mbonye, the New
Vision daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chris Mudoola, who chaired the meeting, was quoted as saying
there were some officials involved in bribery and inflating the
price of the helicopters but the committee had not yet received a
report on this. He advised that the committee institute a
commission of inquiry into the matter.
</P>
<P>
In February 1997, the Ministry of Defense ordered for four
overhauled helicopters through a British Virginia-registered
company, Consolidated Sales Corporation, at a cost of 12 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ministry paid a deposit of 6.5 million dollars to the
supplier but the first group of two choppers were rejected because
they were not overhauled as required.
</P>
<P>
There are also reports saying that some senior military
officers were involved in the helicopter scandal.

<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua)-- The heavy fog which covered
Beijing this morning didn't affect fights at the Capital
International Airport, according to sources with the airport.
</P>
<P>
"Take-offs and landings were not affected by the dense fog this
morning because the visibility in the air is up to the required
level-- higher than 700 meters," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fog blanketed the capital early this morning, disrupting
normal traffic and causing some expressways to close temporarily.
</P>
<P>
But no major traffic accidents occurred during the period,
according to local police.
</P>
<P>
Beijing meteorologists attributed the dense fog to heavy
humidity in the air caused by the recent snow and low temperatures
over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
They said that all of north China was shrouded in the thick fog
this morning with visibility in some areas in Beijing falling to
one to two kilometers.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that the fog will be driven away this evening by
a cold front from the north.

<HEADLINE> BSE Sounds Alarm Against 23 Firms in IT Clothing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bombay Stock Exchange (
BSE) has raised alarm against 23 companies that have changed their
names to suggest a shift in focus to software related activities
from their core business (mostly financial activities) in the
current year.
</P>
<P>
The list, published in "The Economic Times" Wednesday, is in
addition to the 20 companies that were announced on January 27,
1998.
</P>
<P>
"The names of the companies are being announced to warn
investors against such companies," a BSE spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The move has been taken in the wake of increasing volumes and
prices in information technology (IT) and software stocks in
general,he said.
</P>
<P>
The exchange has issued specific instructions to members to
take necessary precaution while placing orders in the Scripps with
an infotech tag.
</P>
<P>
They have been also asked to verify their fundamentals before
taking any investment decision.
</P>
<P>
The move has been taken to check excess volatility, which has
already led to multi-fold rise in the stock prices.
</P>
<P>
For instance, After Infosys, which quoted at 43 rupees (1 U.S.
dollar) on January 1, 1999, is currently ruling at 1,823 rupees (
42.40 dollars) on the BSE appreciating over 42 times in less than
a year.

<HEADLINE> China Creates New Hybrid Wheat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have
successfully created a hybrid wheat using plants of different
genuses, a breakthrough for China's cell engineering and breeding
research.
</P>
<P>
According to researchers with the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
this is the first such cross-fertilization in the world, which has
attracted the notice of scientists worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The hybrid wheat was created by the combination or blend of
wheat cells with a weed originally growing in Australia, and has
been successfully planted on an experimental basis. More than 3.3
hectares of the new wheat have now been harvested.
</P>
<P>
The high-quality wheat is resistant to salt and thus able to
grow in highly saline soil, making it possible to grow wheat in
saline-alkali land, of which there are large areas in China.
</P>
<P>
The new wheat was achieved by a research group in Shandong
Province, east China, headed by Professor Chen Huimin who has been
working on this research for more than 30 years.

<HEADLINE> Post-handover Macao to Enjoy Freedom in Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The approaching Macao's return
to China is not affecting the routine work of Lei Lai Meng,
president of the School of Nations in Macao. "There will be no
obvious change in the school's educational objective and teaching
method," she told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to enjoy full freedom in education after
Macao's return, and we do not have the least worry for that," Lei
added. Macao, a peninsula very close to the financial hub Hong
Kong, is to return to China on Dec. 20 after being ruled by the
Portuguese for more than 150 years.
</P>
<P>
The School of Nations is the first international school in
Macao, with its students coming from more than 30 countries and
regions and faculty from Macao and European and American countries.
</P>
<P>
Private schools like the School of Nations constitute a main
part of the school system in Macao. Of the 123 schools in Macao,
private schools are five times the public schools in number, with
private school students accounting for more than 90 percent of the
total in Macao.
</P>
<P>
As the first chief executive-designate of the future Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR) Edmund Ho Hau Wah has said in
his administrative program, the relationship between public
supervision and self-management of schools will be better handled
in the future.
</P>
<P>
The training of talents is key to Macao's foundation and hope
and the SAR government will make further efforts to promote the
development of Macao's education and give more guidance in this
regard, Ho said, adding that efforts will be made to promote
compulsory education according to law.

"Macao's educational system will remain unchanged after its
return," said Sou Chio Fai, subdirector for the Education and
Youth Services."Private schools will continue to play an active
role in Macao's education, and schools will retain the
independence in teaching, finance management and staffing."
</P>
<P>
Macao is entitled to draft its own educational policies
different from those adopted in the Chinese mainland as is
provided in the Macao SAR Basic Law and embodied in the principle
of "one country, two systems". Under that precondition, religious
organizations, social groups and individuals may continue to run
schools of all kinds, and enjoy independence in running the
schools and freedom in teaching and doing academic research.
</P>
<P>
Besides, students in Macao will continue to enjoy freedom in
pursuing their studies either in Macao or outside Macao, Sou said,
adding that more students may go to schools in the mainland areas
after Macao returns to the motherland.

<HEADLINE> 75,000 Affected by Famine in West Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Some 75,000 people in the West
 Pokot District of west Kenya have been affected by famine, the
Daily Nation newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted district commissioner Solomon Ouko as saying
that the district relief food distribution committee has requested
the government to increase its relief maize from 2,000 to 8,000
bags (90 kilograms per bag) a month.
</P>
<P>
Most divisions in the district have been affected by famine due
to severe drought, the administrator said, urging farmers in the
semi- arid district to step up production in order to be
self-reliant.
</P>
<P>
Kenya this year has experienced a long-spell severe drought,
especially in the northwestern, northern and northeastern arid and
semi-arid regions, leading to a 25-percent drop in the country's
maize production.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has allocated two billion shillings (about
27 million U.S. dollars) to import maize as relief food for those
famine- stricken areas in the country.

<HEADLINE> Auto-Parts Exports See Sharp Rise in S. China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province in south
China exported 24.32 million U.S. dollars worth of auto parts from
January to November this year, a sharp rise of 30.2 percent on a
yearly basis, according to local customs statistics.
</P>
<P>
This increase is attributed to production expansion among local
auto-parts makers, and their efforts to increase their presence
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Exports include such items as wheels, clutches, brakes and
parts, as well as body-work parts, and other auto components.
</P>
<P>
More than 87 percent of local auto-parts exports go to Asia,
North America and Europe, and the rest to Africa, Latin America,
and Oceania.

<HEADLINE> Cyclone John Hits Western Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The most powerful cyclone
ever recorded in Australia, with winds of up to 300 kph, smashed
into Western Australia's north coast Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cyclone John thundered over the coast near the tiny community
of Whim Creek, but emergency services believe bigger coastal towns
such as Karratha would escape its full fury.
</P>
<P>
John is a top-rating category five cyclone and Bureau of
Meteorology of Australia cyclone forecaster Brian Bowase said it
was "unequivocally the most powerful ever recorded in Australia.
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at winds of almost 300 km an hour and quite
frankly that's bloody unbelievable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bowase said John was stronger than both cyclone Vance, which
destroyed much of Exmouth earlier this year, and cyclone Tracy
that devastated Darwin in 1974.

<HEADLINE> Cyclone Ilsa Follows John in Western Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bureau of Meteorology of
Australia warned on Wednesday that a second tropical cyclone is
following in the wake of cyclone John and may cross Western
Australia's Pilbara coast on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cyclone forecaster Brian Bowase said cyclone Ilsa had been
classified category one but was expected to be upgraded as it
approached the coast between Broome and Exmouth.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know how strong it's going to get but we're
continuing to monitor it," Bowase said.
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at strong gales as it crosses the coast,
probably some time tomorrow, but the main thing could be the heavy
rainfall coming on top of the rains brought by (cyclone) John."
</P>
<P>
He said it was not uncommon for one cyclone to follow another,
and the two were not believed to be linked.
</P>
<P>
It was not possible to say exactly where cyclone Ilsa would hit.
</P>
<P>
Cyclone John, which passed over the tiny coastal community of
Whim Creek Wednesday morning, is the strongest cyclone ever
recorded in Australia with wind speeds of up to 300kph.
</P>
<P>
It has been downgraded to a category four cyclone, and wind
speeds of 260kph are expected in nearby Roebourne and Port Sampson.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rainfall and flooding are expected across the Pilbara
coast Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Zhuhai's Cruise Tours Around Macao Booming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Niyaz, a 64-year-old Moslem
from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, northwest China, held
up his telescope to watch the high-rise buildings in Macao as he
cruised the strait by the piece of land that will return to the
motherland on December 20.
</P>
<P>
He was on a tour to the city of Zhuhai, accompanied by his
daughter, who works in the port city of Shenzhen in south China's
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
"It would be even more amazing to walk on the land of Macao,"
he said on the ferry cruising around the island as he clearly saw
the street scenes and clean and beautiful beaches.
</P>
<P>
The package tour organized by Zhuhai City has become a most
appealing activity for some one million tourists arriving in the
port city annually since the late 1980.
</P>
<P>
"Business was amazingly hot between January and September and
we expect it to peak this month," said Pan Xinglian, director of
the Zhuhai Tourist Administration.
</P>
<P>
Wu Cainan, chief executive at the Jiuzhou Tourist Agency, one
of the four franchised tourist firms offering loop tours around
Macao, said Macao's return to the motherland has brought
unprecedented opportunity to the company, as tourists, especially
those from the interior areas, have taken the tour round Macao in
record numbers.
</P>
<P>
The 40-minute tour sets off from Jiuzhou Port in Zhuhai, and
each ferry carries about 200 passengers, who usually crowd the
deck to take snapshots and point out the landmarks of Macao.

<P>
WELLINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- France qualified for the
America's Cup challenger round semi-finals in Auckland, New
Zealand, Wednesday after its opponent America True quiting race.
</P>
<P>
Since America True, which had already qualified, decided not
to race Monday it has been known that the Le defi francais
syndicate aboard 6 Sens would qualify. To get the points to make
it into the final six the French had to finish the cross line
alone.
</P>
<P>
That slammed the door on their nearest rival, Young America
from the New York Yacht Club, which was also sailing alone Monday
after Young Australia declined to race in the now pointless event.
</P>
<P>
It is not known yet whether 6 Sens and Young America will race
Thursday as they are scheduled to do so. The outcome is irrelevant
to the competition.
</P>
<P>
Eleven syndicates from seven countries began the competition
for the Louis Vuitton Cup which gives the winner the right to take
on Team New Zealand for the America's Cup in February.
</P>
<P>
The semi-finals begin on January 2 with each boat sailing each
other twice in a round robin.
</P>
<P>
The qualifiers are Italy's Prada Challenge, Japan's Nippon
Challenge, America True and America One, both from San Francisco,
Dennis Conner's Stars and Stripes from San Diego and France's Le

<HEADLINE> Auto Sales in Thailand to Exceed 26-Month Record in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's automobile sales in
December are expected to exceed November's sales of 21,266 units,
a 26-month high, said a statement from Toyota Motor Thailand Ltd,
which is available Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Toyota, which made the Thai automobile industry statistics for
the government, said the December sales are very likely to break
the record because car companies usually stage sales campaigns
during the last month of the year.
</P>
<P>
Another indicator is the high number of orders auto firms
received at the motor show held in Bangkok from December 4 to 12.
</P>
<P>
Sales volume for the whole year of 1999 will most likely exceed
200,000 units, up by more than 40 percent from last year, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Toyota predicted that the Thai auto market in 2000 would surge
to 260,000 to 280,000 units, rising by 30 to 40 percent from this
year.
</P>
<P>
However, the sales are still far off the 590,000 units that the
industry sold in 1996 before the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In November, some 21,266 new cars were sold in Thailand, an
increase of 16.07 percent from the previous month and a 59.1
percent surge from the same month a year ago.
</P>
<P>
For the first 11 month of this year, overall car market grew by
43.6 percent from the same period last year to a total of 181,134
units.
</P>
<P>
The one-ton pick-up truck segment recorded the highest growth
of 49.7 percent, totaling 106,293 units.

<HEADLINE> 3 Major Thai Cabinet Members under Fire in Censure Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Three major cabinet members of
the Thai government are under fire as the no-confidence debate
against the ruling coalition kicked off Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition New Aspiration Party targeted its fire
against Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmannahaeminda and Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister
Sanan Kachornprasart.
</P>
<P>
Chuan faces accusation of being a "puppet" of foreign interests,
after implementing austere International Monetary Fund conditions
in exchange for a 17.2-billion-U.S.- dollar Asian crisis rescue
package.
</P>
<P>
Sanan is under pressure over the number of houses he owns,
while several close associates of him are under fire for allegedly
building properties encroaching on national parks.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin is also facing opposition accusations that he is
sheltering his brother Sirin, former president of state-run Krung
Thai Bank, from allegations of mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
The censure debate began at around 10 a.m., with the opposition
leader and former prime minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh reading a
statement alleging the government's faults.
</P>
<P>
The opposition handed the no-confidence motion against the
government to the House Speaker Wan Muhammad Nor Matha on November
22, the first day of the new parliamentary session.
</P>
<P>
In the motion, the opposition accused the two-year-old
government of economic mismanagement, corruption and ceding the
country's economic sovereignty to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Chuan is said to have set up two special "war rooms" to counter
allegations raised against the coalition, and appeared calm and
controlled before the start of debate.
</P>
<P>
The debates will be focused on the government's economic
performances on the first day, followed by corruption and power
abusing issues, and ethics on the second and third days
respectively.
</P>
<P>
This is the third no-confidence debate against the Democrat-led
six-party coalition, but it is commonly agreed that it will not
threaten stability of the government which enjoys a comfortable
parliamentary majority and does not have to hold election until
October next year.
</P>
<P>
Chuan's coalition commands 236 of the 385 seats in the lower
house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
According to the constitution, if the Chuan administration
survives the current no-confidence attempt, it will be able to
continue its ruling until the end of its four-year term in
November next year.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Bourse to Test for Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE),
one of the two bourses in Bangladesh, will conduct mock automated
trading on December 18 against possible crisis arising out of the
Y2K problem, The Financial Express reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A DSE official was quoted as saying that the hardware and
software providers have assured them of compliance with the
systems to face the millennium bug in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the development, we have planned to conduct a roll-
over test to ensure that nothing will go wrong," DSE chief
executive officer G.Q. Chowdhury said.
</P>
<P>
All the database of the DSE will be preserved in a safe place
and the test run will be conducted by changing the dates to
December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The DSE has a total of 575 terminal and 30 workstations.
Technicians have tested all the personal computers of brokers and
found all the machines are compliant, according to Chowdhury.
</P>
<P>
After the roll-over test, the authorities will be in a position
to "judge the effects of Y2K if any," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chittagong Stock Exchange (CSE), the other bourse of the
country, is set to begin mock manual trading, the report said.

<HEADLINE> China, US Cooperate on Coal Gasification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Texaco Development
Corporation of the United States, a noted producer of coal
gasification devices, recently sought cooperation in China by
authorizing a machine manufacturer to be "the qualified provider
of Texaco pressure vessels and spare parts."
</P>
<P>
The Jinzhou Heavy-Duty Machine Plant (JHDMP) in the city of
Dalian in northeastern Liaoning Province has become the first in
Asia licensed to produce coal gasification devices based on Texaco
technology.
</P>
<P>
Officials on both sides of the agreement are optimistic about
prospects for their cooperation because a centralized gas supply
is still not available in many small and medium-sized cities of
China, and these products will be greatly needed.
</P>
<P>
Practically pollution-free, gasification is thought to be an
ideal way to turn coal into gas, even though this process requires
sophisticated technologies.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, more than 10 enterprises have been equipped with
Texaco coal gasification devices produced by the JHDMP, whose
capacity to produce them has reached over a dozen units annually.

<HEADLINE> Bad Loans in Thai Banks to Fall to 40 Pct by Year End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Bank of Thailand, the central bank, NPLs at the
end of October totaled 2.35 trillion baht (61 billion U.S. dollars)
, or 43.39 percent of the total outstanding loans.
</P>
<P>
NPLs accounting for four percent of the total outstanding loans
would be considered normal, according to Pisit.
</P>
<P>
Pisit said he is confident of a sharp fall of NPLs next year
due to improved economy, progress in debt restructuring and new
asset management companies set up by local institutions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Thaioil, the country's largest oil refinery,
with debts totaling 2.25 billion dollars, won debt-restructuring
approval from its creditors.
</P>
<P>
Thai Farmers Bank has already announced plans to transfer some
80 billion baht (2.07 billion dollars) worth of bad loans to a new
asset management company run by GE capital and Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
Regulators also plan to split bad loans at state-owned Krung
Thai Bank into a new asset management company, fully owned by the
central bank's Financial Institutions Development Fund.
</P>
<P>
Director of Siam Commercial Bank Olarn Chaipravat also expected
a sharp fall of bad loans due to massive loan write-offs.
</P>
<P>
He forecast that total loan write-offs by the end of this year
would total 334 billion baht (8.67 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Mass Organizations Promote Macao-Zhuhai Contacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Mass organizations in Macao and
the city of Zhuhai in Guangdong Province, south China, are playing
a big role in promoting contacts and cooperation between the two
places.
</P>
<P>
Of Macao's 1,500 mass organizations, the Macao Federation of
Trade Unions is one of the most important non-governmental
organizations in the city.
</P>
<P>
The federation has maintained a very close relationship with
the Zhuhai Trade Union and often sends representatives to Zhuhai
for inspections, visits, and exchange programs.
</P>
<P>
The Zhuhai Trade Union has established a reception facility to
accommodate guests representing trade union organizations from
Hong Kong and Macao. By early this year, the Macao Federation of
Trade Unions had sent about 5,000 representatives to Zhuhai for
visits, sight-seeing tours, and academic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Women's Federation has approximately 10,000 members,
and often organizes women's activities in the interior areas where
they see the astounding changes in the motherland, while inviting
women's organizations from the interior to visit Macao.
</P>
<P>
Contacts between the Zhuhai Women's Federation and related mass
organizations in Macao are diversified. Each year on March 8, the
International Women's Day, women in both Macao and Zhuhai attend
celebrations given by the other side.
</P>
<P>
On International Children's Day, gatherings and children's
calligraphy and painting shows are arranged to enhance friendship
among the youngsters of Macao and Zhuhai.
</P>
<P>
The Zhuhai Women's Federation also assign representatives to
help train kindergarten teachers for Macao. Kindergarten teachers
from both cities also visit the other and exchange experiences.
</P>
<P>
Mass organizations in Macao have also played a vital role in
financing construction projects and introducing business people
from overseas to invest or make donations for the construction of
public welfare facilities in Zhuhai.

<P>
WELLINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Auckland Tennis Center'
s telephone lines have been running hot these days with Steffi
Graf fans trying to buy tickets for an exhibition match after they
heard the German superstar would be playing in February.
</P>
<P>
But local media Wednesday quoted Auckland Tennis marketing
manager Jonh McEwing as saying that negotiations for an exhibition
match have taken place with Graf's agent, and any agreement is far
from signed and sealed.
</P>
<P>
Graf, who retired from competitive play earlier this year, has
been on Auckland Tennis's wish list for some time.
</P>
<P>
"It would be fantastic for New Zealand sports fans if we can
successfully conclude our discussions and are then able to confirm
Steffi's appearance," McEwing said.
</P>
<P>
"She is certainly keen to visit and play in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"The rumors that the deal had been finalized probably came
about because, after playing an exhibition match in South Africa
on Sunday, Steffi apparently said she was now looking forward to
going to New Zealand as part of a tour," he added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Olympic Training Set For February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar said the organization
would retain its commitment to a centralized training program for
the 2000 Olympics despite lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
"We must start the training in February. It will be useless if
we wait for the money, but we have no time left to prepare our
athletes to compete in the Olympics," he said.
</P>
<P>
KONI requested 5 billion rupiah (710,000 U.S. dollars) from the
Gelora Senayan Management Board (BPGS) but the board approved
funding of 2 billion rupiah. KONI will need 6.9 billion rupiah to
prepare and send nearly 50 athletes to the Olympics in September
in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the BPGS will disburse its 2 billion rupiah financial
assistance in January so we can start the training a month later,"
Wismoyo said.
</P>
<P>
He said that if there were fund constraints in the middle of
the training, KONI would ask its provincial chapters and sports
organizations to help by financing training programs for their
athletes already qualified for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13 Indonesian athletes have qualified for the
Olympics from track and field, swimming, diving, weightlifting,
archery,windsurfing and taekwondo. KONI will include about 20
shuttlers for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Wismoyo acknowledge the lone hope for gold was in badminton, in
which it won medals in the 1992 and 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"However, we also have a chance to win medals in taekwondo and
windsurfing," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Wednesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, KONI secretary general Rudolf S. Warouw mentioned
archery,badminton, basketball, rowing, tennis, track and field and
windsurfing sports organizations to receive regular funding from
the International Olympic Committee's Olympic Solidarity fund to
start courses for local coaches next year.
</P>
<P>
Warouw said Olympic Solidarity provided 40,000 U.S. dollars
annually for the courses. Only Olympic sports qualify for the
funds.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economy Predicted to Grow 4 Pct Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia can expect economic
growth of over 4 percent in 2000, higher than the government's
assessment of between 2 and 3.5 percent, an economist of the
Center for Strategic and International Studies Hadi Susastro said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Indonesia attributes the better economic growth
prediction to restored confidence and the prospects for improved
economic growth in the East Asia region.
</P>
<P>
Hadi said that production capacity, which is currently idle,
will have to resume in the year 2000 on the grounds that
international confidence in Indonesia has been restored and that "
this does not need new investment."
</P>
<P>
"Movement in production will encourage our economic growth," he
was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the prospects for economic growth in the East Asia
region in 2000 looked good and this would also favorably affect
the Indonesian economy.
</P>
<P>
But even with the economy growing, he said, the country would
still be burdened with the task of settling various national
issues, including corruption, collusion and nepotism cases.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to continue to settle various national issues
so that a growth of 4 percent can be attained," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the assumption that the inflation rate is expected to be
between 4 and 6 percent, the rate of the rupiah between 6,000 and
7,000 rupiah to the U.S. dollar and the oil price between 16 and
19 U.S. dollars per barrel, Hadi said that these assumptions
should be statically viewed.
</P>
<P>
He cited the planned hike in civil service salaries which is
yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
"The assumption is not static in nature, the increase in civil
salaries will have an impact on other sectors," he added.

<HEADLINE> Land Fund Provides Guarantee for Smooth Operation of MSAR Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- By the end of October, the land
fund of the Macao Special Administrative Region(SAR) has exceeded
9.8 billion Patacas, according to a Chinese representative of the
Sino-Portuguese Land Group.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to good management, the land fund suffered no losses
during the Asian financial crisis, instead it reported slight
increase in value, the representative said.
</P>
<P>
According to provisions of Annex II to the Sino-Portuguese
Joint Declaration on the Question of Macao signed by the two
governments in Beijing on April 13, 1987, from the entry into
force of the Joint Declaration until December 19, 1999, all
incomes obtained by the Portuguese Macao government from granting
new leases and renewing leases shall, after deduction of the
average cost of land production, be shared equally by the
Portuguese Macao government and the future government of the Macao
SAR, and the land fund was established as a result.
</P>
<P>
Now, the total land fund of the Macao SAR consists of two parts:
the land income that belongs to the government of the Macao SAR
and all the earnings from the deposits and investments.
</P>
<P>
The money of land fund belongs to the government of the Macao
SAR. It shall be managed by the Chinese Delegation of the Land
Group before the establishment of the government of the Macao SAR.
The management of this fund directly bears on the interests of the
future government of the Macao SAR and those of the residents of
Macao.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Delegation of the Land Group has all along observed
the principles of going about things steadily and surely, avoiding
risks and seeking high returns in the management of the land fund.
In other words, it has tried its best for high returns while
keeping the fund safely intact.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the average yearly return for the land fund was 6.4
percent, higher than the inflation rate publicized by the
Portuguese Macao government. It was not easy to score such
achievement when the financial investment environment was not good
in Macao and in its surrounding areas, especially when Asia was
hit by the financial crisis, the Chinese representative said.
</P>
<P>
The investments made by Macao's land fund have performed well
before Macao's return to China. When the government of the Macao
SAR is set up on December 20, 1999, the land fund will be handed
over by the Central Government to the Macao SAR government.

January 1955, the Portuguese were forced to halt their
preparations to celebrate "400th anniversary of the opening of
Macao," due to strong protests by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
August 1958, the patriotic Macao Daily News was founded.
</P>
<P>
March 10, 1972, the Chinese government, in a letter to the
United Nations, pointed out that Macao is part of China and has
been occupied by Portugal, and that China will resolve the issue
peacefully by appropriate means when conditions are ripe.
</P>
<P>
April 25, 1974, the new government of Portugal announced that
Macao is not a colony but is Chinese territory under Portuguese
administration.
</P>
<P>
1975, the Portuguese government called back its troops in Macao,
abolished Macao field army and navy commands, and integrated
several police departments to form a unified Macao security force.
</P>
<P>
February 8, 1979, China and Portugal established diplomatic
relations and both sides reiterated that Macao is Chinese

<HEADLINE> Inland Areas to Back Economic Development in Macao(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- China's vast inland areas will
undoubtedly give powerful backing to Macao's economic growth as
its smooth return to the motherland is expected to bring new
development opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC)
has recently taken measures to promote trade and economic
cooperation between Macao and inland areas, including investment,
business, and scientific and technological exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The healthy economic growth and increased national strength of
China constitute the strongest backup force for the Macao region,
whereas the huge market and wide-ranging business opportunities in
the inland areas provide the greatest potential for the economic
development of Macao, said An Min, assistant minister of the
MOFTEC, at a recent seminar.
</P>
<P>
Macao relies heavily on external assistance due to scanty
domestic demand and resources. However, it has its own unique
advantages in location, foreign contacts, industries and cultural
heritage.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation between Macao and the inland areas has
maintained an upbeat momentum since the reform and opening-up
drive launched in China in 1978, with the latter providing raw
materials, labor force, farm produce and by-products, as well as
capital to the former. And Macao in turn serves as a major channel
for the inland areas to attract foreign investment and obtain
economic and technological information from across the world.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by October Macao had invested in 6,357
projects in the inland areas, involving 9.17 billion US dollars
worth of contracts, ranking 10th among overseas investors. And the
inland areas have become Macao's largest exporter and entrepot
trade destination, fourth export market, and its largest external
investor.
</P>
<P>
Inland-funded enterprises, for example, have made up half the
sectors of Macao's banking and insurance, tourism and hotel, and
real estate, totaling approximately 100 billion yuan worth of
assets.
</P>
<P>
The inland areas provide Macao with almost all fresh water,
liquefied petroleum gas, and a large amount of electricity and
fuels. Everyday, the inland areas ship 192 tons of fresh goods via
Zhuhai to Macao to facilitate Macao's economic development and
residents' life.

<HEADLINE> Environment Protection Given Top Attention in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese residents are
developing an increasing awareness of their living environment as
a result of improved living standard.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, people living in China's major metropolitans like
Beijing, Shanghai and Wuhan, would rather escape the smog-shrouded
downtown area and move to the suburbs for better air quality.
Environmental topics have become as popular as talking about the
weather. School children now are quite familiar with such terms as
air pollution index, water resources, noise pollution, and air-
infectious bacteria.
</P>
<P>
The public attention given to the environment has boosted
intensified scientific research efforts to reduce urban pollution.
Research fellows at the South China Institute of Forestry are
concentrating on the study of environmentally friendly plants.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yong'an, a professor with the China Forestry
Administration, predicts that public attention to environmental
protection will continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
Government officials and experts from heavily polluted cities
such as Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Shenyang, recently
convened a meeting in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei
Province, to discuss ways of promoting sustainable development
while protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
A soaring number of vehicles on the roads and the growing
population have produced heavy burdens, exacerbating pollution in
these cities. Participants at the meeting agreed that priority
should be given to treating air pollution, residential garbage,
and traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
China has designated 34 zones as experimental areas for
sustainable development in China's cities, and they have been
allowed to introduce foreign management methods and capital for
urban constructopm. International cooperation will also contribute
to these efforts, as Wuhan and Shenyang have been enlisted in a
United Nations sustainable development program aimed at
alleviating pollution through proper planning.
</P>
<P>
Now, China's environmental regulators have sketched out a
series of procedures to treat pollution under a national
ecological investment program of the State Planning Commission,
the "Green Illuminating Project" under the State Economic and
Trade Commission, and regulations on controlling sulfur dioxide
and acid rain promulgated by the State Environmental Protection
Administration.
</P>
<P>
However, the fundamental solution to problems of environmental
protection lies in overall ecological recovery, according to
ecologists. This task has been made more urgent by the
unprecedented floods on the Yangtze, China's longest river, in the
past two years, which are blamed for serious soil erosion along
the upper reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
A greening project initiated by the State Forestry
Administration and the Ministry of Water Resources has helped
expand greenery over some 6.29 million hectares, and banned
logging on 1.26 million hectares along the river over the past
seven years.

The reform in the inland areas has greatly benefited Macao's
economic prosperity, enabling the region to edge into the world's
fastest economic increases, Prof. Xu Yamin of the Beijing
University said, adding that the two sides still have potential in
economic reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
After Macao's return, nongovernmental exchanges will be further
strengthened and government-oriented cooperation will also play a
bigger role, which will make the two sides more supplementary to
each other in the world market, the MOFTEC official said.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho Hau Wah, Chief Executive-designate of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR), has repeatedly said that the
post-handover Macao will focus on cooperation with the inland
areas, the neighboring Guangdong Province in particular, where the
Macao SAR is to set up a permanent office.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, which has benefited from the inland areas in
fighting the Asian financial turmoil, is looking to the tripartite
cooperation. Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region, has suggested to establish an
economic coordinating zone among Hong Kong, Macao and Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong and Macao have increased police cooperation in
striking cross-border and gang crimes in a bid to improve Macao's
public security.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao Triangle tourism project,
started in 1993, has developed a comprehensive tourism destination
that transcends different social systems and life styles. Now the
three sides are aiming to turn the Triangle a world-level tourist
center.
</P>
<P>
Other inland provinces and cities like Fujian, Beijing,
Shanghai and Chongqing are also planning to expand cooperation
with Macao. Economists predict that Macao, backing by the
motherland, will surely step into a rapid-growth period after two
or three years of recovery and readjustment.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou
Province will grant overseas investors more preferential treatment,
according to a decision made at a recent provincial work
conference.
</P>
<P>
Along with the national policy of exemption of taxation for the
first two years and a tax reduction for another three years,
Guizhou will allow overseas investors to hold a partial share or
the majority of stock of some profitable large and medium-sized
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors also will pay less for the use of land,
electricity, water, and roads. In addition, the local government
will refund taxes levied from foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou has absorbed more than 720 million U.S. dollars of
investment from abroad in the past 10 years, and this year, the
use of foreign investment is to be increased by eight percent
compared with last year's figure. One-fifth of this money came
from developed countries including the United States, Japan, and

<HEADLINE> Villages in Midair Arouse Interest of Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Two north China villages
located on precipitous cliffs hundreds of meters high have aroused
the interest of folklorists.
</P>
<P>
 Outsiders who want to get into the villages must walk a
mountainous path as dangerous as on a rope. The path is actually
just planks fixed to the mountain side.
</P>
<P>
 The two villages, Wanghuagou and Wuhuashan, are situated in
the heart of Guancen Mountain in Ningwu County, Shanxi Province.
The distance between the two villages is about 2.5 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
 The villagers have small flat spaces dug in cliffs as the
site of their houses which are surrounded by clouds.
</P>
<P>
 Looking up from the foot of the mountain, people feel as
though the villagers are living in midair. The locals also build
their mule and sheep pens on the cliffs.
</P>
<P>
 Although transportation conditions there are harsh and water-
fetching inconvenient, the villagers are reluctant to move to
other places to live as they have become accustomed to this way of
life.
</P>
<P>
 Amazed by these houses hanging in the air, some folklore
experts asked the villagers when those houses were built, but no
one could answer.
</P>
<P>
 After a recent fact-finding tour, the folklorists said these
villages are truly of great value for further study.

<HEADLINE> Macao Readying for December 20 Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Macao, which is to end its long
separation from China and return home on December 20, is readying
itself for the grand handover ceremony and carnival-style
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Facilities for a series of major events are ready or almost
ready. These include a ship-like seaside structure, where the
handover ceremony is to be held; the Forum with Chinese-style
decoration, where President Jiang Zemin of China is to declare the
establishment of the Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR)
and where the government of the MSAR will be inaugurated; and a
building complex housing the Foreign Ministry Commissioner's
Office.
</P>
<P>
Above the front gate of the Commissioner's Office is a giant
national emblem of the People's Republic of China covered by a
piece of red cloth. In the early morning of December 20, the
national emblem will be unveiled and, at the same time, all
symbols of Portuguese rule in Macao will disappear here, for ever.
</P>
<P>
There are other signs of what Macao people are doing for the
historic handover. The streets are filled with a festive mood.
Shops, hotels and residential buildings are decorated with posters
and colorful banners that carry slogans welcoming the upcoming
return of Macao to its motherland.
</P>
<P>
Lew Yim Kuen, a local youngster, said, "Our heart is already
home."
</P>
<P>
For officials designate of the MSAR government, December,
normally a month of holidays, is becoming busier than ever as the
day to start implementing the principle of "Macao people governing
Macao" draws near. This is true of celebration organizers of
various circles and more than 4,000 local police officers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, telecom and power-supply departments have worked out
plans to ensure the success of all handover-related activities.

<HEADLINE> Dismissed Romanian Prime Minister Chooses to Return to Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Dismissed Romanian Prime
Minister Radu Vasile appeared Tuesday to have accepted his ouster
by President Emil Constantinescu, saying that he would return to
the senate "in the national interest."
</P>
<P>
Vasile said late Tuesday that he has decided to return to the
senate "to be an ordinary senator" and that he does not want to
see the crisis last long.
</P>
<P>
Vasile, who was sacked by the president early Tuesday after
major parties in the ruling coalition withdrew support for him,
said he would not go to the constitutional court over the
justification of his dismissal, but adding that he would not
announce his resignation either.
</P>
<P>
Vasile had first refused to accept his removal, which he called
"unconstitutional," and vowed to take this to the constitutional
court.
</P>
<P>
The crisis caused by the prime minister's ouster has stirred up
strong reaction from the media as well as the political forum of
Romania.
</P>
<P>
Most opposition parties and many legal experts have questioned
the authority of the president to dismiss Vasile.
</P>
<P>
The largest opposition Social Democratic Party said in a
statement that under the constitution only parliament has the
right to sack the prime minister. It demanded the president
withdraw his decision.
</P>
<P>
Former President and the party's Chairman Ion Iliescu called
for a technocrat government to guide the country and prepare for
next year's general elections.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Vasile's acceptance of his removal might
bring an early end to the political standoff.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Enjoy Final Adjudication Power After Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR) will enjoy the independent judicial power, including
that of final adjudication, after China resumes the exercise of
sovereignty over Macao beginning from zero hours on December 20
when judges of the courts at all levels of Macao SAR officially
swear in.
</P>
<P>
Macao, without independent judicial power for a long time, only
has the court of first instance, and all the appeal cases must be
submitted to the intermediate courts in Lisbon. The final
adjudication power belongs to the Supreme Court of Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese laws defines the qualifications of Macao judges, who
are appointed by a supreme commission of Portuguese judges. The
setup, functions, operation principles and legal procedures are
all defined by the Portuguese legislation.
</P>
<P>
Following the signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration,
Portugal revised relevant articles concerning Macao in its
Constitution and the Organic Statute of Macao, which granted Macao
with greater legislative and judicial autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The Superior Tribunal of Justice of Macao that was established
in April 1993 is Macao's highest level court, which is responsible
for the second hearing and re-examination of the cases submitted
by the courts of first instance.
</P>
<P>
The existing courts in Macao handle most of the cases of Macao,
but they do not enjoy the fully independent judicial power. Some
of the cases, such as those civil and criminal cases involving the
Macao Governor or Assistant Secretary, must be submitted to a
court in Lisbon. Some of the appeal cases, especially those
involving president of the Legislative Assembly, anti-corruption
Commissioners and judges of the Superior Tribunal of Justice, must
be submitted to the Supreme Court of Portugal.
</P>
<P>
The Macao SAR will enjoy independent judicial power including
that of final adjudication after the Chinese government resumes
the exercise of sovereignty over Macao.
</P>
<P>
The courts of Macao SAR shall have complete and exclusive power
of adjudication over all cases in the region, except matters
concerning acts of State such as defence and foreign affairs. No
instruction issued by the Supreme Court of the People's Republic
of China shall have binding force on the region. The Macao SAR
will have primary courts, intermediate courts and the Court of
Final Appeal. The Basic Law of the Macao SAR grants its power of
final adjudication to the Court of Final Appeal.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of nomination of an independent committee
responsible for recommending judges, Macao SAR's First Chief
Executive-designate Edmund Ho Hau Wah announced on October 7 of
this year the name list of judges of the Macao SAR courts at
various levels, including three judges of the Court of Final
Appeal.
</P>
<P>
These judges, who will be officially appointed on December 20,
will carry out the Macao SAR Basic Law, the principles of "one
country, two systems," "Macao people governing Macao," and a high
degree of autonomy, and safeguard the independent judicial power,
including that of final adjudication.
</P>
<P>
Functions and power of the Macao SAR courts, especially that of
the Court of Final Appeal, will be defined by the Organic Law of
the Macao SAR Judicial System which is under formulation.

<HEADLINE> South China's Guangxi Reports Higher Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region expects an eight percent economic growth rate
this year.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the autonomous region will
accomplish 200 billion yuan (24 billion US dollars) in gross
domestic product (GDP) for all services and products generated in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi's fast economic growth is attributed to the central
government's policy to spur domestic demand and the expansion of
reform in state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Local industrial enterprises have been doing well since the
beginning of the year, and reported profits for the first time in
three years.
</P>
<P>
In the first ten months of this year, the comprehensive index
of the autonomous region's industrial economic benefit was 73.9
percent, up 13.7 percentage points over the same period last year.
Small industrial enterprises in the region realized profits of 55
million yuan (6.6 million US dollars), and large and medium-sized
state-owned or controlled industrial enterprises realized 78
million yuan (9.4 million US dollars) in profits.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, more money recently has been invested in
improving the region's infrastructure. A total of 155 capital
construction projects requiring an aggregate state investment of
67.2 billion yuan in Guangxi have been included in the state plan.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has also pumped more investment into
capital construction. And more flood control facilities and major
embankments along the coast are now finished, coupled with
completion of a number of water control and ecological projects,
all of which have helped improved the region's capacity to combat
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The living environment and quality of life for urban residents
in Guangxi have improved enormously as more investment has been
spent to build transportation, water and gas supply, and trash and
sewage treatment projects in urban areas of the region, said local
sources.

<P>
ROME, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Ex-SS captain Erich Priebke, 85,
who is serving a life sentence in Rome as a war criminal, suffered
a heart attack Tuesday and was taken to hospital, his attorney
Paolo Giachini said.
</P>
<P>
Priebke, who was serving his jail term under house arrest at
Giachini's home, was accompanied by the attorney to San Camillo
Hospital in Rome, according to the ANSA news agency.
</P>
<P>
Priebke arrived at the hospital late in the afternoon,
complaining of strong pains in his left chest. Doctors said they
would keep him under observation for 24 hours before deciding on
treatment.
</P>
<P>
ANSA said Priebke's room in the hospital is under guard by
Carabinieri, Italy's paramilitary police.
</P>
<P>
Priebke was convicted for his part in the brutal 1944 massacre
of 335 Italian men and boys at the Ardeatine Caves on the
outskirts of Rome in reprisal for the killing of 32 German
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Priebke's provisional first year of house arrest will end on
February 8. If it is not renewed, he will have to go back to jail.

<HEADLINE> Birds in China Under Greater Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- While walking in the fields
two weeks ago, two farmers living in the Taihang Mountains in
north China discovered a big bird with an injured wing.
</P>
<P>
To save the bird, they took it home and reported their
discovery to a local forestry department, which told them the bird
was a grey crane under second-class state.
</P>
<P>
The department contacted wildlife protection personnel and the
bird was sent to a zoo in Taiyuan, capital of Shanxi Province, for
medical attention.
</P>
<P>
As winter sets in, large flocks of birds begin to fly south.
However, weak and wounded birds usually lagged behind their
brothers and sisters in migration.
</P>
<P>
More often than not, people in the province will feed and
treat wounded birds and contact wildlife departments, and some 60
rare birds such as the grey crane, swan, wild geese, and wild
ducks have been saved in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
But not everyone is a good Samaritans. Seeking profit, some
persons unlawfully hunt the birds in Shanxi and then try to
smuggled them overseas. To cope with this problem, the police have
strengthened their crackdown on the poaching activities.
</P>
<P>
On November 9, police in the city of Houma in Shanxi Province
discovered in three bamboo baskets holding 17 owls, three of which
were dead.
</P>
<P>
The pest-eating owls living in the forests of the Taihang and
Luliang mountains are under strict protection. But an owl can
fetch as much as 1,000 U.S. dollars on the black market.
</P>
<P>
The police have sent 14 living owls to a wildlife protection
center, and they continue to hunt down illegal traders.
</P>
<P>
In another incident, police in Taiyuan recently impounded on a
vehicle on a highway which held 12 eagles that are under second-
class state protection, and three suspects were arrested.
</P>
<P>
At present, the eagles are recovering after rehabilitation at
a zoo in Taiyuan.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi Province is not the only place where people are paying
greater attention to protecting birds. Tianjin Municipality in
north China, which has 235 kinds of birds, is doing a good job as
well.
</P>
<P>
Since early 1982, a "loving birds week" is arranged every year
in the port city to increase people's awareness of wildlife
protection, and residents in the city have set up five wildlife
centers.
</P>
<P>
Police in Tianjin have resorted to stern measures against
poachers, illicit bird traders, and restaurant owners who
illegally purchase bird meat.
</P>
<P>
As a result, official surveys have found that the number of
birds and bird species are both increasing year by year.

<HEADLINE> Outlook on U.S. Life Insurance Industry Revised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Standard &AMP; Poor's has
revised its outlook for the U.S. life insurance industry to
negative from stable.
</P>
<P>
The global ratings service said that the revision reflects its
view that pressures affecting the industry and the industry's
attempts to confront those pressures over the next few years will
leave the industry weaker at the end of that period than it is
today.
</P>
<P>
According to the service's outlook report released Tuesday, the
overriding influence that will have a negative effect on ratings
will be the pressure on the industry by the capital markets to
attain greater efficiency in its deployment of capital.
</P>
<P>
"Either earnings will have to improve to better serve the
existing capital of the industry or capital will have to be
reduced so that what remains is better served by existing earnings,
" the report said. The service believes that most insurance
companies will pursue a strategy involving a combination of both
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
As financial convergence runs its course, the report said, life
insurance companies will increasingly be compared in their
profitability to other types of financial institutions. But life
companies generally do not look good in such comparisons.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the report said, the industry has built its
capital position to historically high levels, contributing to
lower returns on equity. Many companies have sustained their
financial strength ratings with an over-abundance of capital.
Such positions have been sustained, in part, because of the
continuing dominance of the mutual form of ownership in the
industry.

BRASILIA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Agriculture
Minister Vinicius Pratini de Moraes said Tuesday that the next
Brazilian harvest of 1999-2000 will set a new record of 83.4

The minister highlighted in particular the country's steady
growth rate of agricultural productivity, which has been

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Minister on Challenges of Power Sector Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUCSON, U.S., December 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria Tuesday said that
challenges should be handled in reforming the nation's power
sector in order to carry out the government's firm commitment to
the provision of reliable electricity to all consumers in the West
African country.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian minister of power and steel, Bola Ige, told a
plenary session of the three-day U.S.-Africa Energy Ministers
Conference that "The government is committed to an enabling
environment which guarantees level ground competition to make free
power market thrive in Nigeria and will do everything possible to
ensure that costs of operation and unnecessary tolls are reduced
to barest minimum."
</P>
<P>
"The Federal Government is establishing a new power policy
within a national energy policy and will subsequently create a new
power trade and free market within Nigeria and promote same in the
West African sub-region," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, "Government is fully aware of the responsibility that
this goal bears as well as the various factors militating against
its moves and it has enough political will and strength to combat
them," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian minister, who assumed his office after the May 29
Swear-in of Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo in the wake of a
successful transition to civilian rule in the country, listed
seven major challenges in reforming the country's power sector.
</P>
<P>
They are: need for immediate action, restructuring of existing
power company, restructuring the power sector, provision of
enabling environment, creation of infrastructure, developing a
national transmission grid, and surmounting social problems.
</P>
<P>
The oil-rich Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa,
and it has been long under the military rule since its
independence from the British colonial rule in October 1960. The
election of Obasanjo as its civilian president put an end to the
military rule and marked a return to the civilian rule in the West
African country.

<HEADLINE> Top Cyclists Reported Taking Dope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Blood tests on some of the world'
s top cyclists showed they had taken dangerous performance-
enhancing chemicals, according to a prosecutor's report sent to
the Italian Olympic committee Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The tests were carried out as part of an investigation by
Bologna prosecutors into the sale, prescription and administration
of harmful pharmaceuticals to sportsmen and women.
</P>
<P>
In May, indictments were requested for 16 doctors and sports
managers accused of damaging athletes' health by having them take
dangerous pharmaceuticals and hormones.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Olympic Committee, Coni, asked to see the results
of the tests in order to consider possible disciplinary action
against the individual athletes, even though they are considered
as victims in the Bologna probe.
</P>
<P>
The investigation involves top level cyclists, including
Italians Mario Cipollini, Ivan Gotti, Paolo Salvodelli and other
big international names such as Pavel Tonkov, Abraham Olano and
Axel Merckx.
</P>
<P>
Gotti was the controversial winner of this year's Giro d'Italia.
He took the title after Marco Pantani, the runaway leader, was
suspended because of a dangerously high red blood cell count.
</P>
<P>
The list of names delivered to Coni also contains some former
cyclists such as Claudio Chiappucci, Tony Rominger, Ferdinando
Escartin and Armand De Las Cuevas.
</P>
<P>
"Certain blood readings, such as haematocrit and ferratin,
represented a danger for the cyclists' health," said one of
consultants called in to conduct tests.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a case of natural variations, but of alterations due
to the taking of various substances," he continued.
</P>
<P>
One of the 16 people for whom prosecutors have requested
indictments is Michele Ferrari, a doctor paid for his services by
Gotti, Cipollini, Tonkov and Savoldelli among others.
</P>
<P>
Ferrari stands accused of giving cyclists growth hormones and
substances like EPO - technical name eritropoietine - which
thickens the blood by increasing the number of oxygen carrying red
corpuscles.

<HEADLINE> Wembley Faces Rival Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- A late bid to oust Wembley as
the site of the new national stadium is being formed by a
consortium of top contractors.
</P>
<P>
The organisation London International Stadium wants to build a
150,000 seater facility in Hillingdon, a borough off the A40 route
into west London.
</P>
<P>
The proposal coincides with confirmation from Wembley National
Stadium Ltd and UK Athletics that a bid to host the 2005 World
Athletics Championships at Wembley can go ahead.
</P>
<P>
Sir Norman Foster's design for the new Wembley stadium was
originally rejected by the government because consultants Ellerbe
Becket said it failed to make adequate provision for the staging
of athletics events.
</P>
<P>
The Hillingdon stadium is understood to include retractable
seats that make it suitable for both athletics and football, as
well as a sliding roof - features missing from the new Wembley.
</P>
<P>
The Hillingdon consortium also believes it can build its
national stadium for 300 million pounds, which is a massive 175
million pounds cheaper than Foster's building.
</P>
<P>
Consultant Gary Francis said: "We are confident we can be ready
to open in 2004 allowing a year for the planning and consultative
stage.
</P>
<P>
"The area is served by three tube lines and a mainline station
that goes to Marylebone, but could be extended into Paddington as
the track runs parallel.
</P>
<P>
"We are only 15 minutes from Heathrow. To reach the stadium you
wouldn't have to go through any residential areas and there are
plans for a six lane link road to the stadium off the A40."
</P>
<P>
He argued that Wembley was "so difficult to get to" and"
historical reasons" were not good enough to keep the stadium there.
</P>
<P>
"On our site you could have a great stadium any size you want
and with Brunel University nearby you have a campus that would be
suitable for an Olympic village," said Francis.

<HEADLINE> Chevron to Make West African Gas Pipeline Operational in Late 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUCSON, U.S., December 14 (Xinhua) -- Chevron, one of the world
's largest energy and chemical companies, Tuesday told Xinhua that
the company is scheduled to complete the construction of one of
West Africa's most significant regional energy project, the West
African Gas Pipeline (WAGP), in late 2000 and make the project
operational in late 2002.
</P>
<P>
Chris Miller, Chevron's project manager who is in charge of
the work on WAGP, said that after a series of feasibility studies
and legal environment studies, "Chevron plans to finish the WAGP
construction in the fourth quarter of 2000, and the pipeline is
expected to be operational in late 2000."
</P>
<P>
In a joint venture agreement signed on August 16 in the
Nigerian capital of Abuja, Chevron has been appointed project
manager for WAGP. The joint venture agreement establishes a
consortium of six energy resources companies to develop WAGP,
outlines the corporate structure of the joint venture and
establishes a program to expedite the technical and commercial
activities required to complete pipeline development by 2002.
</P>
<P>
The consortium and the governments of Benin, Ghana, Nigeria
and Togo signed a Memorandum of Understanding on August 11,
granting development rights to the consortium.
</P>
<P>
The 965-kilometer pipeline, is expected to cost about 400
million U.S. dollars and to initially ship some 120 million cubic
feet per day of Nigerian gas for sale to power-generation
customers in Benin, Ghana and Togo, he said.
</P>
<P>
"So far, we do not have any difficulties in doing this project,
" he said. "The three parties, the governments, the pipeline
consortium and the customers, all see the benefit of the project."
</P>
<P>
In addition to delivering much needed energy to West African
countries, it is envisioned that the project will significantly
contribute to the economies of the participating nations through
the creation of jobs and low-cost fuel for new industrial and
commercial development ventures, he said. "Responding to these new
demands, the volumes may double or triple over the life of the
project."
</P>
<P>
The WAGP project will reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by
cutting down on flaring associated with existing oil production in
Nigeria, an oil-rich country in the world. Air pollutants will be
further reduced because natural gas will replace the use of fuel
that are less "friendly" to the environment in power generation
and industrial production, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also participating in the projects are companies from Nigeria,
Ghana and Togo.
</P>
<P>
Operating in Africa since 1930s, Chevron has been working with
the nations of Africa to develop, refine and market their
hydrocarbon resources. At present, the company is doing business
in more than 90 countries worldwide.
</P>
<P>
From its headquarters in San Francisco, California in the
United States, Chevron's global operations extend to all realms of
the energy business -- from oil and gas exploration and production
to refining and marketing, petrochemicals, logistics and trading,
and shipping.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic Solidarity
Commission has approved the Olympic Solidarity budget for 2000 for
a total amount of 31 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The commission, chaired by the International Olympic Committee
President Juan Antonio Samaranch, also approved a special budget
of 21,3 million dollars to help the National Olympic Committees (
NOCs) with their participation in and contribution to the success
of the Olympic Games in Sydney, according to an IOC press release
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The IOC said that these funds are aimed at assisting a
determined number of athletes and officials to be present at the
Olympic Games as well as to help the NOCs to develop their
structures and programmes.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the participants at the commission's meeting on
Monday approved the arrangements of two meetings in 2000. The
first one will be held in Rio de Janeiro, during the Association
of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) General Assembly in May.
</P>
<P>
The second one will take place in Sydney just before the
Olympic Games start. During this meeting the Olympic Solidarity
will present for approval the objectives, programmes and budget
for the 2001-2004 quadrennial.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Solidarity is the arm of the IOC responsible for
redistributing the share of the revenue generated by the sale of
broadcast rights of the Olympic Games to the NOCs to help them
develop their local sports infrastructure and train athletes,
coaches, and administrators.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council Delays Vote on Iraq Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- At the request of
France, the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday once again
delayed its vote on a draft resolution on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. diplomats, France delayed the vote, saying
it needs more time to consider its position on the draft
resolution which has been under contentious debate for months
among the 15-member Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution seeks to create a U.N. weapons inspection
regime for Iraq and it would suspend sanctions if Iraq cooperates
with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Council president for the current month
Jeremy Greenstock of Britain said he had reported to the Council
that at the request of one Council member for more time, the
scheduling of the formal vote has been postponed. He gave no new
date for the vote.
</P>
<P>
Alain Dejammet, France"s Ambassador to the United Nations said
earlier that Paris wanted more clarity on the so-called "trigger
mechanism" that sets criteria for the sanctions suspension.
</P>
<P>
Changes have been made on the key section over the last twenty-
four hours but it is still too vague to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have been pressing for the vote
on the draft resolution for several days, an apparent attempt to
revive U.N. arms regime for Iraq at an earlier date which was met
with rejection from some members of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
 It is widely seen here that if the draft resolution was
adopted, it would start a complicated new process on weapons
inspection and humanitarian program.
</P>
<P>
U.N. weapons inspectors withdrew from Iraq days before the U.S.
-led military strikes against the country last December. Iraq has
barred them from returning unless the stringent U.N. sanctions get
lifted.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990. According to relevant U.N. resolutions, Iraq must
be free of weapons of mass destruction before the sanctions can be
lifted.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. Government 99.9 Percent Y2K-Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Tuesday that all but a handful of the government's most
important computer systems are prepared for the New Year's date
change.
</P>
<P>
"As of today, 99.9 percent of the government's mission critical
computer systems are Y2K compliant," Clinton said in a statement
accompanying a report on the issue by the White House Office of
Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
The administration said only 16 of the government's 6,159 most
important systems are not prepared for the Y2K rollover, and those
others will be ready later this month.
</P>
<P>
The government said it will have spent 8.38 billion U.S.
dollars on the massive project, an increase of 37 million dollars
from September's estimate, which it attributed to higher last-
minute testing costs.
</P>
<P>
"We have met the deadline, and we have done it at below cost,"
Clinton said. He cautioned that "no amount of preparation can
prevent us from glitches," but assured Americans that backup plans
are ready.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's top Y2K adviser, John Koskinen, also cautioned that
glitches are inevitable, even in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Not every system will be fixed, and even some of those that
have been fixed and tested may experience glitches," he said.
</P>
<P>
Their remarks came as the Office of Management and Budget
released its final report on the government's efforts, saying
those 16 systems yet to be repaired are in the Defense and Justice
departments.

<HEADLINE> Italy at Forefront in Renewable Energy in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Italy is at the forefront of
research and development into alternative sources of energy and
can rightly show the rest of Europe the way forward, Italian
industry Minister Pierluigi Bersani said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference held by Enea, the national council for
nuclear and alternative energies, Bersani cited statistics showing
the steady development of alternative forms of energy in Italy
over the last ten years.
</P>
<P>
"On a European level Italy holds a leading position in the area
of renewable energy," he said, "This sector has been handled in
exactly the right way."
</P>
<P>
According to Enea, in 1998 some 17 million Petrol Equivalent
Tons(PET) of energy were produced from renewable energy sources.
</P>
<P>
This accounted for 9 percent of national consumption and
followed a decade of annual growth averaging 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The slice of Italy's electrical energy deriving from renewable
sources was almost 17 percent of the national demand and had grown
by 2.6 percent a year since 1990, the report said.
</P>
<P>
There was also progress in wind power, which had gone from zero
to 51,000 PET a year since 1990, and in bio-combustible fuels,
which were up from zero to 81,000 PET a year over the same period.
</P>
<P>
But hydroelectric power and the simple burning of wood and its
derivatives continued to account for the lion's share of the
alternative fuel supply, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Hydroelectric power supplied to the national grid rose from 7.
49 million PET in 1989 to 9.07 million in 1998, while wood
remained constant at about 6.4 million PET.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Kobe Bryant, Los Angeles
Lakers guard, has bought a 50 percent stake in Olimpia Milano, the
Italian pro team that his father Joe Bryant used to play for,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-ol Bryant will be partners with Pasquale Caputo in
ownership of Olimpia Milano, which has won 25 Italian league
championships.
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be the first time a professional basketball
player has acquired a substantial interest in another pro team.
Players in the American National Basketball Association are
prohibited from owning a piece of an NBA team.
</P>
<P>
"We think it's great that Kobe is showing support for pro
basketball in Italy, where he grew up," NBA spokesman Terry Lyons
was quoted as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bryant attended school in Italy until the eighth grade while
his father, Joe, established himself as one of the premier players
in the league.
</P>
<P>
Bryant entered the NBA straight out of high school and was an
All-Star by his second season.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for the Bryant family to direct basketball
operations for Olimpia Milano, a responsibility his father Joe
will fulfill as a team vice president.
</P>
<P>
Kobe Bryant plans to spend several weeks every offseason in
Milan to work with his father, make appearances and work with his
corporate partners.

VIENNA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Austrian ice dancer Angelika
Fuehring was said in satisfactory condition Tuesday after
suffering serious head injury when her partner dropped her on the
ice last weekend during a photo shoot in Linz, Austria.
</P>
<P>
Fuehring, 23, five-time Austrian national champion, broke her
cheekbone and fractured her eye socket Sunday when her partner,
Bruno Ellinger, lost his balance and dropped her on her head,
according to the Austria Press Agency.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Vows to Aid Africa in Sustainable Energy Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUCSON, U.S., December 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Government
Tuesday said that it will work hard to help African nations with
sustainable development, which means to tap the potential of its
rich energy resources while paying close attention to
environmental protection on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a key-note speech at the plenary session of the
three-day U.S.-Africa Energy Ministers Conference, which kicked
off here on Monday evening, Bill Richardson, the U.S. secretary of
energy, said that, "Though we gather from different points on the
globe, we share a commitment to Africa, to its sustainable energy
development, its integration into the world marketplace, and its
overall prosperity."
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, energy ministers from the United States
and Africa are convening on a continent-wide basis to discuss
Africa's energy future, and the future of the energy partnership
between the U.S. and Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
The current conference attracts some 50 African energy
ministers and 450 representatives from governments, industrial and
financial realms and international organizations and private
sector.
</P>
<P>
"For Africa, sustainable energy development would enhance
prosperity, diminish poverty and liberate resources for essentials
such as health services," he said. "This conference is a
cornerstone of my African Energy Initiative to foster energy
cooperation and sustainable development in Africa into the next
century and beyond."
</P>
<P>
On the basis the U.S.-Africa Partnership Plan put forward by U.
S. President Bill Clinton, Richardson has raised the initiative in
a bid to strengthen the ties between America and Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We will work with countries and regional organizations in
Africa, and the Agency for International Development, the Trade
and Development Agency, the Small Business Administration, the
Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Export Import Bank
" to carry out the initiative, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the energy development must be kept within the
framework of the environmental protection. "As you know, burning
fossil fuels and wood produces greenhouse gases," he said.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 32.42 at 11,160.17,
expanding its loss of 32.11 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 12.05 at 1,403.17 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell 86.51 at 3,571.66.
</P>
<P>
The stocks fell after the Commerce Department reported that
retail sales rose 0.9 percent in November, the largest increase in
three months. Investors feared that the report may prompt the
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to ward off inflation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index
rose just 0.1 percent in November, its most modest showing in five
months. But investors focused on the retail sales rise and worried
about the rate hike.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised rates three times this year to
cool off the U.S. economy in an effort to keep inflation under
control. But stocks have raced higher as well as more consumer
spending.
</P>
<P>
Investors believed that the Federal Reserve would raise rates
again to cool off the economy due to steep rise in consumer price.
But analysts said it will not happen at the next Federal Reserve
meeting on December 21 because of concerns with Y2K problem and
the Federal Reserve may raise the rates as early as next February.
</P>
<P>
Profit-taking also helped to drag stocks lower. Investors pull
money of the market to lock in profits from recent strong rallies
of technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 4.44 at 632.07 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 0.91 at 827.78. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 7.58 at 462.80.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,085 down, 1,048 up and 437
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 1.02 billion shares from 971.01
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Maskhadov Says Ready for Dialogue With Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 14 (Xinhua) -- President Aslan Maskhadov of
Russia's breakaway republic of Chechnya said Tuesday that he is
ready to meet federal leaders and Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Chairman Knut Vollebaek.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov promised to guarantee the safety of Russian and OSCE
officials in the areas under his control, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek, who is also foreign minister of Norway, said earlier
Tuesday while touring neighboring Daghestan that the OSCE is ready
to join mediation efforts to end the fighting in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
But Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Adveyev
said Moscow does not need help from international organizations in
resolving the conflict, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE could use its international influence in aiding Russia
's anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya by calling on all
countries not to support Chechen terrorists, Aveyev said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a lack of go-betweens in the conflict but the
absence of an influential Chechen who could hold talks on behalf
of the republic," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that our colleagues in the West underestimate the
danger of terrorism. Our units in Chechnya are defending the whole
of Europe from the danger of terrorism as well as Russia's
integrity."
</P>
<P>
Russia launched the current military campaign against Chechen
rebels in September following their armed incursion into
neighboring Daghestan and a spate of terrorist bombings, also
blamed on the rebels, that killed about 300 people in Moscow and
two other Russian cities.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. Continues to Commit to Panama Canal's Security (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Tuesday that the U.S. will continue its commitment to the
Panama Canal's security and the transfer of the canal to Panama
underscores U.S. confidence in Panama's ability to manage the
canal.
</P>
<P>
A transfer ceremony was held in Panama Tuesday, but Clinton
and other senior U.S. officials failed to attend it.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Clinton said the U.S. will continue to
"work closely with Panama to safeguard the canal and promote the
well-being of our citizens and people around the world."
</P>
<P>
"Today's ceremony underscores our confidence in the government
of Panama and the Panamanian people's ability to manage this vital
artery of commerce," he added.
</P>
<P>
"It also signals our continuing commitment to the security of
the canal, as enshrined in our treaty obligations, and our
determination to work with Panama and the many other countries
that use the canal to ensure that it remains open to the world's
shipping and commerce," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
After the transfer, the canal will be run by the Canal
Authority, an autonomous institution created with the consensus of
all political parties in Panama.
</P>
<P>
"At the edge of a new century, the canal, long a symbol of
American power and prestige, now also symbolizes the unity and
common purpose of the democratic nations of the Americas," Clinton
added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Vice President Al Gore is busy at his campaign to replace
Clinton in 2000, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will
stay at home to push the Israel-Syria peace talks. The U.S.
delegation was headed by Former President Jimmy Carter, who signed
the treaties with Panama in 1977 to turn over the canal to Panama.
</P>
<P>
However, White House spokesman said that the U.S. is "well
represented at this ceremony." "We have a number of Cabinet
officers there," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, speaking at a regular White House briefing,
rejected suggestions that the absence of senior U.S. officials
from the ceremony was linked to conservative criticism of the
transfer as the presidential campaign starts next year.
</P>
<P>
"I think some of the somewhat hysterical comments coming from
the right, notwithstanding, that seek to distort the record, just
have to be ignored, as is often times the best way to deal with
some comments," Lockhart said. "Our commitment to that region of
the world is unparalleled by any president."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lockhart said that the absence does not indicate "
any lower estimation" of Panama.
</P>
<P>
"We have an important relationship with Panama. We've worked
closely with them over the last 22 years to reach this day,"
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said the president has taken 12 foreign trips this
year. "That puts a heavy load on both the president and the staff.
"
</P>
<P>
"There are many trips that he wants to take that he believes
are important that we just can't do. This fits that category. So
this decision was not made based on the politics," the spokesman
added.

<HEADLINE> Panama to Guarantee Canal Security: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian President
Mireya Moscoso said Tuesday that her country will guarantee the
efficient, secure, and competitive functioning of the interoceanic
waterway.
</P>
<P>
"We achieved the victory, the canal is ours," said Moscoso in a
speech after the exchange of letters of understanding for the
delivery of the Canal with former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, who
represented the Washington government.
</P>
<P>
Panama is walking toward the perfecting of its biggest wealth,
its strategic geographical position in world trade, she said.
</P>
<P>
The United States will hand over the Canal to Panama and will
withdraw its troops from the interoceanic waterway, according to
the 1977 Torrijos-Carter treaties.
</P>
<P>
The responsibility of administering in an efficient and secure
way the Panama Canal will be exclusive of the Panama Republic and
of Panamanians, which will be done without any kind of political
involvement, she said.
</P>
<P>
Moscoso said that the long term goal is to make the waterway a
world class leading enterprise, at the competitive service of the
international maritime community.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian president said that to achieve this goal, Panama
needs the support of the developed countries and the solidarity of
the Iberoamerican countries.
</P>
<P>
Moscoso and Carter exchanged the letters of understanding
during a ceremony in the floodgates of Miraflores before six Latin
American heads of state and the king Juan Carlos. Not any high-
ranking U.S. official attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Latin American presidents present at the ceremony were
Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico,Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador, Carlos Roberto
Flores of Honduras, Hugo Banzer of Bolivia, Andres Pastrana of
Colombia, and Miguel Angel Rodriguez of Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-five years of United States colonialism in the so-called
Panama Canal Zone ended with the exchange of two letters of
understanding signed Tuesday by Carter and President Moscoso.
</P>
<P>
Carter signed in 1977 as U.S. president the agreement for the
handover of the Canal with then Panamanian government head General
Omar Torrijos, who died in an air accident in 1981.

UNITED NATIONS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The proximity talks
between the two parties of Cyprus adjourned Tuesday after twelve
days during which both parties have engaged very seriously with
the whole range of issues that divided them.
</P>
<P>
The talks were undertaken between Glafcos Clerides, President
of Cyprus and the leader of the Greek Cypriots, and Rauf Denktash,
the leader of the Turkish Cypriots which began on December 3 at
the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the press, U.N. Secretary-General's special advisor
on Cyprus Alvaro de Soto said the talks would resume early next
year.
</P>
<P>
Soto said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan had invited the two
parties to resume the talks on the same basis next year and the
date would be announced in due course. He gave no details on the
talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. brokered proximity talks mean that Clerides and
Denktash are within reach other but do not meet face to face, and
U.N. coordinators shuttle between them.The talks are aimed to
prepare the ground for the later direct talks.

<HEADLINE> Panama Canal Transfer is Historical Fact for L. America: Carter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Former United States
President Jimmy Carter said here Tuesday that the transfer of the
Panama Canal to the isthmus country is a historical fact for all
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The transfer ceremony was held Tuesday in the Panamanian
capital and had a numerous international attendance, among them
six Latin American heads of state and King Juan Carlos of Spain.
</P>
<P>
The six presidents who attended the ceremony were Ernesto
Zedillo of Mexico, Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador, Carlos Flores of
Honduras, Hugo Banzer of Bolivia, Andres Pastrana of Colombia, and
Miguel Angel Rodriguez of Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
"We are witnessing a historic protocolary act, very important
for all the Latin American countries," said the former U.S.
president.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-five years of United States colonialism in the Zone of
the Canal of Panama ended with the exchange of letters of
understanding, signed by Carter and Panamanian President Mireya
Moscoso.
</P>
<P>
However, Carter warned that the United States has the right and
the duty to defend the Panama Canal from external threats that
imperil the security of the interoceanic waterway after the
handover of the canal on December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"But it has been agreed that this will be always done jointly,
with the cooperation and at the request of Panama, if this were
necessary.
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you that Panama has inherited not only the canal,
but also some challenges, because there is always the menace of
drug traffic, and there is a serious threat for the environment,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Carter ended his speech by saying that this is a marvelous
opportunity for the United States to recognize the excellent
potentiality of the canal, not only for Panama, but also for the
United States and all the countries of the world.

<HEADLINE> Italian Premier Puts Off Visits to Jordan, Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema
Tuesday postponed a scheduled trip to Jordan and Israel next week
because of the political situation at home.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema was due to visit the two countries from December 20 to
23, but the recent rise of tensions within the ruling center-left
alliance has compelled him to verify whether he still has a
working majority.
</P>
<P>
He is due to address the Lower House at the end of the week,
probably Saturday, after the passage of the budget bill, and has
said he may offer to stand down unless his speech receives the
necessary backing from all the components of his 12-party
coalition.
</P>
<P>
The situation came to a head Monday when D'Alema offered to
resign immediately after repeated attacks on his leadership from
the tiny Democratic Socialist party.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Socialists and others in the coalition say the
alliance must change leaders to have a chance of winning the next
general election, which must come by spring 2001.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema Monday received the strong backing of his party, and
was also advised by President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi to postpone the
political reckoning until after the budget vote.
</P>
<P>
Observers in the press expect one of the outcomes of Thursday's
debate could be a resignation only for D'Alema to be reassigned
the premiership after a reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Another could be a snap election although that is considered
less likely.
