<HEADLINE> Sudan Reiterates Unconditional Acceptance of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Sudan on Wednesday reiterated
its unconditional acceptance of an Egyptian-Libyan peace plan
aimed at helping realize national reconciliation in the conflict
country.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Ambassador to Egypt Ahmad Abdel Halim told reporters
that his government "has fully accepted all the articles included
in the Egyptian-Libyan peace initiative."
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government is ready to sit down to talks with the
opposition without any conditions, Abdel Halim said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya proposed in August the five-point initiative
calling for permanent cease-fire in Sudan and convocation of a
meeting of the preparatory committee for a peace conference to be
attended by all related parties.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Halim said the Sudanese government has formed the
delegation to the preparatory committee's meeting to discuss the
agenda of the peace conference and possibility of achieving
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government hopes that the opposition National
Democratic Alliance (NDA) will, during its meeting in Kampala,
Uganda, on November 22, be able to appoint its representatives to
the committee's meeting, he added.
</P>
<P>
NDA groups northern Muslim political parties, which want to
share power with Sudan's Islamic government, and the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army (SPLA), which has fought a 16-year-old
war for greater autonomy for the mostly Christian south.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim parties have accepted the Egyptian-Libyan peace plan
while SPLA has rejected it, saying it favors the role played by
the Eastern African Inter-Governmental Authority on Development in
mediating between it and the Sudanese government. The opposition
group is expected to adopt a final decision on the initiative
during its Kampala meeting.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Meets Assad's Son on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile
Lahoud Wednesday held talks with Bashar Assad, the son of Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad, on peace process in the region, the
state-run National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Lahoud reiterated the unity of Syrian and
Lebanese tracks in the peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its ally Syria have insisted on a comprehensive
and lasting peace settlement, which includes an Israeli withdrawal
from both south Lebanon and Syria's Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Golan Heights during the 1967 Middle
East war.
</P>
<P>
It set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The two discussed the latest developments of the peace talks
and the efforts made by the international community for the
resumption of talks on Syrian and Lebanese tracks have stalled for
three years and a half.
</P>
<P>
The younger Assad, apparently being groomed by his father to
succeed him, came here following a visit to France where he met
with French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He called on France, which once ruled Syria and Lebanon, to
play a bigger role which can be complimentary to that of the
United States in peacemaking.

<HEADLINE> UK'Inflation Looks Set to Fall Next Year: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The UK's inflation looks set to
fall next year before picking up again in 2001, the Bank of
England said in its quarterly inflation report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is
predicting that the underlying rate will drop below 2
percent before returning to target in two years' time.
</P>
<P>
This would force the MPC to explain to the government
why inflation was so low and what measures would be taken
to remedy the situation.
</P>
<P>
This also suggests that the Bank does not at present
believe further interest rate rises will be necessary to
curb inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Bank has raised interest rates twice in the past
three months to 5.5 percent in order to clamp down on
inflation pressures, as strong economic growth pushes up
price pressures.
</P>
<P>
However, the report acknowledges that there are
"considerable uncertainties" about its forecasts, with the
nine MPC members divided on the likely outcome.
</P>
<P>
Much of the uncertainty centers on the strength of
sterling, with members split on whether the pound will
remain at its present high value.
</P>
<P>
As the forecast was based on sterling falling back,
removing the current dampening effect on inflation, others
believed it would remain strong, helping to keep prices
subdued.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the MPC predicts that the economy would grow
by 2.5 percent to 3 percent over the next two years, in
line with the forecasts in Tuesday's pre-Budget report
from the Chancellor, Gordon Brown.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia will stand in the
vanguard of the battle against HIV/AIDS, a fatal disease that has
been rampant in the world, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum
Mesfin said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the on-going First International Conference on AIDS,
Mesfin said that his country could not allow AIDS to destroy its
youth and its future.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia would do its best to ensure that people living with
HIV/AIDS should not be subjected to special restrictions such as
employment, education and access to public facilities and housing,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international partners to come and work with
the Ethiopian government in the fight against the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
More than 700 local and foreign researchers across the world,
together with senior Ethiopian government officials and
HIV-positive ones, attended the conference held under the theme
"Fighting for Life."
</P>
<P>
The involvement of AIDS orphans, sex workers, business and
religious leaders and world-class scientists made the conference,
the first of its kind in Ethiopia, a unique forum for raising
awareness.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest official study, Ethiopia currently has
about three million people, including 140,000 children, living
with killing AIDS.

<P>
A press release from Iraq's mission to the United Nations
said as of November 9, 1999, the value of contracts under the
last three phases of the oil-for-food program put on hold by
the two countries had exceeded one billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The contracts put on hold include those for the supply of
humanitarian goods urgently needed by the people of Iraq, such
as medicines, medical equipment, water purification equipment,
spare parts for electricity, educational material, agricultural
equipment and transport and communications equipment, the
mission said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time since this program was initiated on
December 10, 1996 that 649 contracts with a total value
exceeding one billion dollars have been put on hold by the
United States and Britain, said the mission.
</P>
<P>
The two states have thus confirmed once again that their aim
is to continue their policy of genocide against the people of
Iraq, to refuse to implement Security Council resolutions which
they have drafted with their own hands and to ignore the
recommendations of the U.N. Secretary-General, it added.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Entrepreneurs Urged to Set up Bigger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi Wednesday urged entrepreneurs to be more committed and
vigorous in establishing bigger businesses in order to greatly
contribute to building the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks in the capital Nairobi when he
launched 12 buses which are part of a bigger fleet bought by the
Kenya Bus Company, said a news release issued by the Presidential
Press Service here.
</P>
<P>
He noted that apart from building the country's economy, the
businesses will also greatly contribute to providing employment as
well as the much needed tax to the central government.
</P>
<P>
The president told Kenyans that it is solely their task,
through unity and hard-work, to build the nation's economy, and
they should not expect the Kenyan economy to be built by
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The work of building a nation is not the task of one person but
of the whole collective, Moi said, adding that the local media,
too, has a role to play in the work of building the nation.
</P>
<P>
He lauded the Kenyan entrepreneurs for re-investing in the bus
company, which has provided jobs to 2,500 Kenyans, saying the
company serves 300,000 commuters within Nairobi and its environs
and 7,500 passengers in up- country routes everyday.
</P>
<P>
It is the responsibility of the government to ensure that jobs
are created for its people, Moi said, adding that global economic
recession has caused widespread joblessness in Kenya.

KUWAIT CITY, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting former
U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar said here Tuesday
that China, the world's most populous and biggest emerging power,
will become a very important country.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the new world order will last very long,
because I think other countries will emerge as very important
countries, such as China," de Cuellar said in an interview with
Kuwait the power of the U.S.."
</P>
<P>
But he urged Washington to "use its influence in a moderate
manner." He underlined that the U.S. "has to understand that in
order to be respected by all countries it should act within the
limits of the U.N. Charter."
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of increasing the number of the permanent
Security Council members, de Cuellar said it is something that
should be considered, but it will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
He said that in most of the cases, the five permanent members of
the U.N. Security Council, namely the U.S., Britain, Russia,
France and China, have been more or less united.
</P>
<P>
He also called for efforts to eradicate the world poverty,
which he believed has affected the world peace, security and
stability, citing examples of some African and South American
countries.
</P>
<P>
De Cuellar stressed that development of the developing
countries is something urgent, saying "many problems we are facing
now are problems whose origin is underdevelopment."
</P>

During his stay here, De Cuellar discussed with Kuwaiti
leaders the issue of more than 600 Kuwaiti and third country
nationals allegedly still being held in Iraq. He voiced his
support for a quick solution to the humanitarian matter.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
postponed his official visit to Greece after consultations between
the governments of the two countries, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement Wednesday, Reppas said that following talks
between the two countries and in the interests of Greek-American
relations, the Greek government has proposed to the White House
that Clinton's first-ever visit to Greece take place from November
19-20 and the latter has accepted the Greek proposal.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president was originally scheduled to visit Greece on
November 22-24 and this was later changed to November 13-15.
</P>
<P>
Reppas said that the two governments believe that extra time
before the visit will be used productively to ensure the best
organization of Clinton's Athens trip.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources said Wednesday that Clinton postpones his
visit to Greece to avoid protests marking the November 17, 1973
students' uprising that is instrumental in toppling the military
junta in Greece at that time.
</P>
<P>
In the past days, bomb blasts and demonstrations have taken
place in Athens to protest against Clinton's forthcoming visit and
the U.S. policy on the Balkan region as well as Washington's
failure in helping resolve the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Clinton postponement as "a good thing" for
Greece, Greece's Democratic Social Movement party leader Dimitris
Tsovolas said Wednesday that Clinton's visit is part of the U.S.
attempt to impose a "new order" on the Balkan region, including
upgrading Turkey's role, dropping Greece's right to veto and
pressuring Greece and Cyprus over legitimizing the results of the
invasion and occupation by Turkey of the island republic.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Slightly Improved Image of Swiss Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A survey by the Swiss Bankers
Association (SBA) shows that the attitude of the Swiss towards
their banks continues to improve, with over half those questioned
holding a positive opinion of the banks.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the findings of the two previous surveys in 1997
and 1998, the 1999 survey reveals a brighter overall picture, said
the SBA in a press release Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Today, 52 percent (48 percent in 1998) of those questioned
hold a positive or very positive opinion of the banks," the SBA
said. "Almost a third (31 percent) are indifferent, and around 15
percent share negative to very negative feelings."
</P>
<P>
After a one-year break, the banks are again perceived as the
most important contributor to prosperity in Switzerland, ahead of
the chemical and pharmaceutical industry with 91 percent (87
percent in 1998) believing the banks play a key role in the
economy, ahead of the chemical sector with 86 percent (90
percent).
</P>
<P>
However, 66 percent of those questioned still believe that the
banks are cutting too many jobs. The level of criticism is down
slightly, but so is the belief that bank loans help create jobs in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
On the matter of dormant accounts, at least half of those
questioned now believe the banks are tackling this difficult
problem in an appropriate manner and acknowledge the progress made
in this area.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Swiss are still critical of the banks
when it comes to jobs and support for small- and medium-sized
enterprises, with most of this criticism levelled at the big
banks.

<HEADLINE> Israel Delivers Redeployment Maps to Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli chief negotiator
Oded Eran Wednesday handed over to his Palestinian counterpart
Saeb Erekat the maps of the next Israeli troop redeployment in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The maps outlined the areas which Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
will transfer to the Palestinian side during the next
redeployment under the Sharm el Sheikh peace deal signed by
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat in early September.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Israel has to transfer 3 percent of the West
Bank territories from Area C (under full Israeli control) to Area
B (where Palestinians exercise administrative control) and 2
percent from Area B to Area A (under full Palestinian control).
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet has approved the maps earlier Wednesday in
a vote of 17-1 with one abstention.
</P>
<P>
The maps were immediately presented to the Knesset
(parliament) after the cabinet approval.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said that he will hand over the maps to Arafat for
approval upon his return from his ongoing visit to Europe.
</P>
<P>
The next redeployment, also called the second phase
withdrawal, will take place November 15 as stipulated by the new
peace deal.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Economist Forecasts More Jobs in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian economy will roar
into the next century by creating a total of 600,000 jobs this
year and next, according to bank chief economist Tim O'neill of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The job generator is a combination of a red-hot U.S. economy,
the low Canadian dollar, higher disposable incomes and stronger
business investment, the Gazette daily of Canada quoted him as
saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Job creation in 2000 will almost match this year's 300,000 new
jobs, according to O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment is expected to average a new low of 7.4 percent in
2000, from this year's 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The economist said that Canada's economy would see a growth
rate of 3.8 percent for this year, to be followed with a slightly
coller rate of 3.4 percent in growth for next.
</P>
<P>
On the negative side, O'Neill said that interest rates are
headed higher in both the U.S. and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Higher rates will lead to cooler, but not recession-bound, U.S.
and Canadian economies in the latter part of 2000 and 2001, said
the economist.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that short-term interest rates in the U.S. will go
up a total of 75 basis points by the end of the first half of
2000.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Canada will match some U.S. increases by raising
the bank rate 5 basis points to 5.25 percent though mid-2000, said
the economist.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Refugees Have Sacred Right to Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A visiting senior Palestinian
official stressed here on Wednesday that the Palestinian refugees
have "sacred" right to return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian refugees must return to Palestine. Their right
to return is sacred," said Jebriel Rajoub, director of the
Palestinian Preemptive Security Department in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"It will remain one of the legitimate rights (of the
Palestinian people) until a fair solution is found to the refugee
issue," Rajoub told reporters after meeting with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Palestinians were displaced and forced to find
shelters in neighboring Arab countries in the Arab-Israeli
conflict in the past half century. The Palestinians insist that
the refugees have the right to go back to their homeland while
Israel disagrees.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the Palestinian refugees is high on the agenda of
the Palestinian-Israeli final-status negotiations, Rajoub said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel inaugurated the negotiations on
September 13 and began the first session on Monday. Besides the
refugee issue, the negotiators will also discuss issues including
the final borders, Jewish settlements and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Rajoub dismissed reports that the Palestinian National
Authority is contacting Gulf Arab states for arrangements to
settle a large number of Palestinian refugees in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Rajoub arrived in Cairo earlier in the day for a short visit.
He briefed Moussa on the security situation in the Palestinian
self-rule areas and the final-status talks.

<HEADLINE> Quebec Premier Vows to Stay On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard
has vowed to stay on in power with "commitments" to lead Canada's
French speaking province into a third sovereignty referendum.
</P>
<P>
"One of my commitments will be to do everything I can to settle
the political future of Quebec through a referendum," said the
leader of the ruling Parti Quebecois before a party caucus meeting
held late Tuesday in Quebec City.
</P>
<P>
He was reacting to rumors arising less than four years since he
became premier in January 1996 that he might drop out of public
life because sovereignty was losing popularity among Quebecers.
</P>
<P>
"Speculation has become a national sport," Bourchard said,
adding "I am the premier, I was elected to fulfill some mandates
and that's what I'm going to do."
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old premier also indicated readiness to run for the
next term of five years, saying "don't ask me at what age I will
retire, I haven't decided yet."
</P>
<P>
An Ekos poll released in mid-October indicates that support for
Quebec's secession from Canada has hit the lowest level for the
past three decades, with only 38 percent of respondents saying
"yes" to a "sovereign-partnership" with Canada.
</P>
<P>
Quebecers seeking sovereignty have lost two referendums
respectively held in 1980 and 1995. This year has seen a series of
polls indicating a steady decline in support for secession.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wholesale Prices Fall 0.1 Percent in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. wholesale prices fell
0.1 percent in October, as the cost of energy and food dropped
sharply, the Labor Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the decrease in the Producer Price Index
followed a sharp 1.1 percent spike in September, the worst showing
in nine years. Analysts believed that spike was caused by
temporary increases in cigarette and car prices, which both rose
sharply in September.
</P>
<P>
October's performance, marking the first drop in wholesale
prices since a 0.5 percent decline in February, was better than
expected.
</P>
<P>
If excluding the volatile energy and food categories, the
"core" rate of inflation at the wholesale level rose a
stronger-than-expected 0.3 percent in October, the second
consecutive monthly increase. In September, the core rate grew by
a sharp 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decline in wholesale prices, if matched at the consumer
level, could ease concerns at the Federal Reserve about a
potential outbreak of inflation.
</P>
<P>
Financial markets, focusing on the bigger-than-expected rise in
the closely watched core rate of inflation, reacted negatively to
the report. Yields on 30-year Treasury bills, which had been
falling before the figures were released, rose to 6.09 percent
from 6.07 percent late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, wholesale prices have been rising at an
annual rate of 2.9 percent, compared with no change for all of
1998. The rise in this year's wholesale prices has been coming
from big increases in energy costs, which had been declining for
much of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that October's energy costs fell by 1
percent, the biggest drop since a 1.1 percent decline in February,
reflecting falling prices for gasoline and heating oil. A 5.5
percent drop in heating oil prices, the largest decline since a
6.9 percent drop in February, led the decline in overall energy
prices.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices dropped 3.8 percent, the best showing since a
7.8 percent down in December, also contributed to the decline in
energy prices.
</P>
<P>
According to a nationwide check of gasoline stations by the
Lundberg Survey, gasoline prices have been falling since peaking
on Sept. 24, the highest average since June 1996. The lower
gasoline prices reported in the survey largely reflect a modest
decline in crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Food prices posted a solid 0.7 percent decline, reflecting
falling prices for eggs, pork and fresh vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in food prices occurred despite the damage to
crops and livestock from hurricanes and other bad weather that hit
parts of the country in September.
</P>
<P>
However, the price of fresh fruits rose by 1.7 percent,
reflecting sharply rising prices for grapefruit and raspberries,
that overwhelmed decreasing prices for strawberries and lemons.
</P>
<P>
Last Month's decline in overall wholesale prices occurred
despite a 1.1 percent increase in prices for passenger cars and a
1.2 percent rise in the price of prescription drugs. That was the
biggest increase since June 1998, when prescription drugs rose 1.3
percent.

<HEADLINE> Search for EgyptAir "Black Box" Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. investigators on
Wednesday are continuing the search for the cockpit voice recorder
from the ocean depths where the Boeing 767-300 on EgyptAir Flight
990 crashed October 31.
</P>
<P>
The plane's flight data recorder, one of the two "Black Boxes",
was retrieved early Tuesday and now is under analysis by experts
of U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The recorder's tape contains parameters measuring air speed,
altitude, settings of engines and many other data, valuable to
investigators to determine the cause of the accident which killed
all 217 on Board.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-bound plane plunged some 60 miles south off Nantucket
Island, Massachusetts soon after it took off from New York.
Investigators still wonder whether it was a result of mechanical
defects, operational errors or human sabotage.
</P>
<P>
Two remotely operated vehicles containing sophisticated robots
were used to catch the data recoder from depths of more than 70
meters.

<HEADLINE> German Turk Shoots Seven People Dead in Family Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A Turk living in German city of
Bielefeld Wednesday shot himself dead after he killed seven
country people in a family tragedy, the ARD television reported.
</P>
<P>
Four women were included in the victims, the police said.
</P>
<P>
The neighbors called the police after they had heard many
shoots in the apartment at late Tuesday night. A special commando
of police hurried to the scene and found six corpses, three men
and three women.
</P>
<P>
The fourth woman was severely injured when she was found. She
died shortly after being sent to hospital.
</P>
<P>
The gunman, identified by the authorities simply as Mehmet K.,
fired at the family apparently after they rejected his request to
marry one of the four women.
</P>
<P>
Hours later, Mehmet K. was spotted in his car by the police in
Tuebingen, 550 kilometers south to Bielefeld. After leading police
on a chase, he shot himself in the head, police said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Diamond Exports Delayed Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The export of diamonds
from South Africa is being held up again, after having experienced
several months of delay earlier this year due to a dispute between
De Beers and the new government valuator over diamond values.
</P>
<P>
While that dispute was resolved, apparent problems have
resurfaced over the country's diamond exports, the South African
Press Association reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted diamond industry analysts as saying that
diamond exports by De Beers had been halted again as delays had
occurred with the diamond valuator.
</P>
<P>
De Beers spokesperson Tracy Peterson confirmed the hold-up,
saying the current consignment -- number 97 -- should have been
exported "a few weeks ago".
</P>
<P>
"The delays are the result of a number of factors, including
the earlier backlog of exports," she explained. She declined to
elaborate on the other factors.
</P>
<P>
"There isn't a deadlock like there was a few months ago. The
consignment is now in the final stages and we expect it to be
exported soon." She said, adding De Beers had been engaging in
negotiations with the government valuator, the Department of
Mineral and Energy Affairs and the Diamond Board on a regular
basis to avoid problems.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Denies Harboring Angolan Rebel Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government on
Wednesday denied that it was harboring the Angolan rebel leader
Jonas Savimbi who fled from his country after Angolan government
forces overran his strongholds of Andulo and Bailundo in the
central highlands.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency, an
official of the Ugandan Foreign Affairs Ministry in Kampala said
it was mere speculation by newspapers.
</P>
<P>
"Newspapers here were speculating that Uganda is harboring
Savimbi. It is not true. I don't know where they got it from.
Savimbi did not come to our country," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi was reported to have sought refuge in Uganda following
heavy military losses to the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi, a veteran guerilla leader, has been at war with the
Angolan government since 1975.
</P>
<P>
Angola plunged back into a full scale civil war in December
last year after the final breakdown of a 1994 United Nations
brokered peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe which was reported to have masterminded the offensive
against Savimbi denied that it had more than 2,000 combat troops
deployed in Angola to help crush Savimbi's strongholds.

<HEADLINE> ILO Urges Job Strategies to Boost Goals of 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The International
Labor Organization (ILO) has proposed a number of measures aimed
at generating new, quality jobs that will help people work their
way out poverty, U.N. said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new strategies were endorsed at an ILO International
Consultation on follow-up to the World Summit for Social
Development, held in Geneva from November 2-4, 1999. The ILO
recommendations are a major input into the process for furthering
implementation of the social summit.
</P>
<P>
At the Social Summit, which was held in Copenhagen in 1995,
countries pledged to work towards the goal of eradicating poverty,
full employment and full social integration for all people.
</P>
<P>
While there have been job gains in several countries, the ILO
estimates that there are still 150 million unemployed people in the
world, and more than 750 million underemployed people, more than
40 percent of whom are young workers.
</P>
<P>
The ILO recommendations followed a series of regional meetings
held in Bangkok, Abidjan, Geneva and Beirut earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations General Assembly will hold a special session
from June 26-30, 2000 in Geneva to evaluate progress in
implementing the Social Summit and to suggest new concrete
initiatives to overcome obstacles.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Refugees Continue to Flee to Tanzania, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Burundi refugees
fleeing violence in the country's southern provinces are arriving
in western Tanzania at the rate of more than 400 people a day, the
United Nations refugee agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Geneva-based U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) has said that from November 1-8, UNHCR staff had
registered 2,650 new arrivals in the districts of Kigoma, Kasula
and Kibondo and 1,500 in Ngara.
</P>
<P>
During October, more than 7,000 Burundi refugees had crossed
to the same areas, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Refugees said that they were fleeing ongoing fighting between
rebels and government forces, the spokesman said, adding that the
new arrivals have also told UNHCR staff that the government has
stepped up efforts to "regroup" civilians in makeshift sites
without adequate shelter or supplies.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR, Tanzania now hosts some 275,000 Burundi
refugees.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier report, the Rome-based U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) said that an upsurge in Burundi's six-year civil
war has forced suspension of nearly all emergency food
distribution in the tiny central African nation.
</P>
<P>
The FAO findings coincided with a visit to Burundi by Kieran
Prendergast, U.N. under-secretary-general for political affairs,
who arrived in the country on Saturday to discuss the nation's
deteriorating political and social situation with the government,
opposition and U.N. agencies.
</P>
<P>
Since Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the country's first Hutu
president in October 1993, an estimated 200,000 people, most of
them civilians, have been killed in fighting between Hutu rebels
and the Tutsi-dominated army.

<HEADLINE> Afghans Protest Against U.S.-Motivated Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Afghan people
took to the streets of Kandahar, home to the headquarters of the
ruling Taliban militia, on Wednesday to protest against the
U.S.-motivated sanctions on Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Crowds of people marched through the streets of the southern
Afghan city, waving placards and chanting slogans outside a United
Nations office, said the Afghan Islamic Press (AIP).
</P>
<P>
The protesters burned a U.S. flag, the Pakistan-based private
news service said.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden, a Saudi dissident, has been indicted by the United
States on the charge of masterminding the bombings of two U.S.
embassies in East Africa in August last year.
</P>
<P>
According to AIP, the protesters chanted slogans in favor of
bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
"Osama is a guest of the Afghans. Even the Taliban government
is not permitted to expel him," a protester was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The protesters presented a statement to the U.N. office in
Kandahar denouncing the U.S. sanctions against Afghanistan, AIP
said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding bin Laden as innocent, the Taliban earlier proposed
to hold talks with the United States on the thorny issue but
Washington has rejected the offer.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Delays, Shortens Visit to Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will delay and shorten his trip to Greece at the recommendation of
the Greek government for security reasons resulted from protests,
the White House said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed, following the recommendation by the Greek
government, that the president will visit Greece November 19 and
20," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart announced.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had originally planned to go there this weekend and
stay there for two nights. The trip will also bring him to
Bulgaria, Italy and Turkey, where he will attend a summit of the
Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"The Greek government made its recommendation in the interest
of U.S.-Greek relations. We will use the additional time to work
with the Greek government on the best possible schedule for the
president's visit and to complete substantive preparations,"
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
In Greece, several parties in the country have called for daily
protests against the visit, and security concerns were raised by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I expect the demonstrations, and I'm not troubled by them, and
I think that the security issues will be fine," Clinton told
reporters before a cabinet meeting at the White House Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Polls show that Clinton is very unpopular in Greece. More than
80 percent in a survey said they had negative opinion of Clinton.
The poll also shows that more than 90 percent of Greeks were
against the U.S.-led NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Most Greeks also blame the United States for doing nothing to
stop Turkey form invading and dividing Cyprus in 1974.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Ruling Party to Challenge Pak Army Takeover in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Muslim League, the
former ruling party of Pakistan headed by deposed prime minister
Nawaz Sharif, Wednesday decided to challenge the army takeover in
the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
It will also ask the Supreme Court for restoration of
constitution, national and provincial assemblies and the senate.
</P>
<P>
PML's Central Coordination Council has decided "unanimously" to
challenge the dismissal of the government, call for the release of
Nawaz Sharif and other leaders, restoration of constitution and
parliament, said Zafarul Haq, former minister for religious
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif, his brother Shahbaz
Sharif, former information minister Mushahid Hussain, former head
of Ehtesab (accountability) Bureau Saifur Rehman and former
finance minister Ishaq Dar along with some other PML leaders are
under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
However, Haq said PML backs the new government's call for
accountability. "But it should not be based on vindicitiveness,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Crop Prices Projected to Further Dip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Crop prices are expected to
further drop as the United States and other major agricultural
producers reap big harvests of grain and soybeans this year,
raising further the stockpiles of the crops, the U.S. Agriculture
Department reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The department said average price that farmers will get for
soybeans this year is expected to range from 4.60 to 5.10 U.S.
dollars a bushel, down 15 cents from last month's projection.
Wheat and corn prices are expected to run about 5 cents lower than
the October forecast.
</P>
<P>
The country's corn and soybean crops this year are the third
biggest on record despite the drought that hurt farmers in the
East and parts of the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Department raised its forecast of the corn
harvest by 1 percent from last month to 9.54 billion bushels.
Soybean production was forecast at 2.67 billion bushels, down 1
percent from last month.
</P>
<P>
U.S. farmers will go into next spring with 2.02 billion bushels
of corn stockpiled, up from the 1.8 billion they started with this
spring and 1.3 billion bushels in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Stockpiles of wheat also are growing even though U.S. farmers
cut back on their acreage this year because of the low prices they
were getting. The government projected a surplus of 1 billion
bushels for the 1999-2000 crop year, up from 946 million bushels
for 1998-1999 and 722 million bushels for 1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
Projected exports of U.S. wheat are down 25 million bushels
from last month because of increased competition from foreign
producers. The Agriculture Department said Argentina, Australia,
Canada and Kazakstan all are raising bigger-than-expected crops
this year.
</P>
<P>
This year's cotton production is forecast at 16.5 million
bales, up 19 percent from last year, when a drought destroyed
crops across the South.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Continue Supervision of Jerusalem Holy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel
Rauf Rawabdeh said on Wednesday his kingdom would never
relinquish its supervision of the holy sites in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has protected these sites from falling into the hands
of the Israeli Ministry of Religious Affairs, Rawabdeh said in a
statement to the press.
</P>
<P>
He did not identify the sites, and also stopped short of
saying how the desert kingdom is supervising them.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan is ready to hand over the supervision on these
sites to the Palestinians when they are able to protect these
sites from falling into Israeli hands.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said Jordan does not intend to interfere in
the affairs of a future Palestinian state, but will provide the
Palestinians with all possible support.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated Jordan's persistent support for the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem
as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordanian forces in the
1967 Middle East war, but Jordan has kept its supervision on holy
sites of the city.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and for years
it has been actively promoting the peace process between the
Jewish state and its Arab neighbors, particularly with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Amman believes the Palestinian issue is the core element of the
Middle East peace process and a just, durable and comprehensive
peace can not be achieved without a settlement to the issue, said
the minister.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Approves Next West Bank Troop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli cabinet
Wednesday overwhelmingly approved the second phase of its troops
redeployment in the West Bank under a latest Israeli-Palestinian
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet endorsed the maps of the scheduled redeployment by
17 votes to 1, with one abstention, paving the way for the
transfer of 5 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians on
Monday. Four ministers did not take part in the vote.
</P>
<P>
As part of the coming withdrawal, 3 percent of the land will be
transferred from full Israeli control to Palestinian civilian
jurisdiction, and 2 percent from joint to sole Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
The redeployment was stipulated in the latest
Israeli-Palestinian interim agreement signed in Sharm el-Sheikh,
Egypt, in September. To date, the agreement has been implemented
more or less as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
In the agreement, Israel pledged to withdraw from 18.1 percent
of the West Bank in three stages, ending in January. In 11 percent
of the land targeted for withdrawal, Israel previously had sole
control, while in the remaining 7.1 percent, it ruled jointly with
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In the first stage in September, Israel handed over 7 percent
of the West Bank to the Palestinian administrative rule, while
remaining in charge of security.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have set an ambitious goal of reaching a
framework agreement on permanent peace by February next year.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet voting came hours after the Israeli army
dismantled a rogue settlement encampment near the West Bank city
of Hebron under orders of Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers evicted hundreds of Jewish settlers from the Maon
Farm outpost after they refused to leave by themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Maon Farm outpost was the last of the 12 hilltop
encampments the settler leaders agreed to dismantle voluntarily
under a compromise deal reached one month ago with Barak.

<HEADLINE> UK May Scrap Ancient Ban on Catholic Monarch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain may change the ancient
law that bars Catholics from taking the throne, the government
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The monarchy has until now been untouched by the far-reaching
constitutional reforms introduced by Prime Minister Tony Blair
since coming to power in 1997.
</P>
<P>
But the Blair's government response to calls this week for the
abolition of a law that many Catholics consider an insult has
signalled the issue may not be dormant for ever.
</P>
<P>
"I think the message is that we're not going to do it now, but
we're not saying we're never going to do it," said a Downing
Street spokeswoman. "We don't have any short-term plans to make
any changes, but we don't rule out change in the future.
</P>
<P>
"This government has always stood up against discrimination and
wouldn't defend legislation that many consider discriminatory,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The Church of England is the established religion, and the
monarch is head of the church. But there are 4.4 million Catholics
in England and Wales, and 750,000 in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
A Catholic spokesman welcomed the news that Downing Street had
not ruled out a change.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican President Elected SI Deputy Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 10 (xinhua) -- Mozambican President and leader
of the ruling Frelimo party Joaquim Chissano has been elected as
deputy chairman of the Socialist International (SI) during the
organization's 21st Congress in Paris.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued Wednesday by the Frelimo
Central Committee, Chissano's election on Tuesday obtained "highly
positive" comments on the part of participants to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters shortly before the official announcement
of Chissano's election, the Frelimo general secretary, Manuel
Tome, who is heading the Frelimo delegation in Paris, said that
"the choice of President Chissano was due to his own merits, since
his political vision surpasses the limits of Mozambique and of
Africa, and because of the example of Frelimo's performance within
the Socialist International".
</P>
<P>
"The election of President Joaquim Chissano is a great honor to
Frelimo and also to the country, and brings an added
responsibility to Frelimo's participation in the SI," added Tome.
</P>
<P>
During this congress, Frelimo's status within the SI has been
raised to that of full member. Frelimo has been taking part in SI
meetings for 17 years, successively as a guest, an observer, a
consultative member, and now a full member.
</P>
<P>
The number of members of the SI, which is now chaired by the
portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterre, has grown to 150.
The congress, being held under the theme "for a more human
society, for a fairer world", is to end on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Judge Asks for Rwanda's Help in Genocide Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The president of the
United Nations tribunal for Rwanda is expected to meet Wednesday
with the Rwandan ambassador to the United Nations to persuade the
Rwandan Government to resume cooperation with the Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
She will have the scheduled meeting after she said that she was
very distressed by the Rwandan Government's recent announcement
that it was suspending cooperation with the court following a
decision by the Appeals Chamber to release a suspected war
criminal.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of cooperation may derail future trials of
suspects indicted in connection with the country's 1994
genocide, Judge Navanethem Pillay said.
</P>
<P>
She said he was prepared, as the president of the International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, to explain to the Government last
week's decision by the Tribunal's Appeals Chambers to release Jean
Barayagwiza on the grounds that his rights had been violated
through a combination of delays in the pre-trial stage of his
case.
</P>
<P>
Barayagwiza had been held for 19 months before he was brought
before a Tribunal judge.
</P>
<P>
"The only way we can gain credibility is to act as
independent judges and that is what this is about," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We do need the cooperation of the Rwandan Government, both for
the prosecution and the defense," she said. "And if we do not
secure the attendance of witnesses, then of course we cannot hold
trials."
</P>
<P>
Following the Appeals Chamber's order, Barayagwiza subsequently
requested that the Tribunal not execute the part of the decision
which calls for him to be sent back to Cameroon, where he had been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released by the Arusha-based Tribunal,
Barayagwiza argues that he has no legal status, resources or
family in Cameroon and wants to have the liberty to choose his
final destination.
</P>
<P>
The new Tutsi-led government in Rwanda ended the genocide in
July 1994 when their rebel army invaded from neighboring Uganda.
Rwanda has been conducting its own trials, having jailed tens of
thousands of people for long periods of time without any court
hearings, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Kigali government has criticized the slow pace of the
trials held by the Arusha-based Tribunal and protested the absence
of a death penalty.

UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A foundation
established by Ted Turner in support of the United Nations has
announced that it was awarding an additional 51 million U.S.
dollars to back U.N. projects around the world, U.N. officials
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Foundation (UNF) said that the primary focus
in the new round was given to programs related to children's
health.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced after the Foundation's Board of
Directors met in Cape Town, South Africa, last week to award its
fifth round of founding for U.N. projects.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the announcement, the U.N. deputy secretary-general,
Louise Frechette, said that the entire U.N. system was grateful
for the generous support provided by the NUF.
</P>
<P>
Frechette chairs the U.N. Fund for International Partnership
(UNFIP) Advisory Board, which reviews projects submitted by U.N.
agencies and recommends them to the Foundation Board for approval.
</P>
<P>
Ted Turner, the founder and chairman of the Foundation, said
the Board was "delighted with the growing quality and focus of
the project proposals from the U.N."

<HEADLINE> Egypt Denies Deportation of Workers from Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Manpower and
Immigration Ahmed el-Amawi on Wednesday denied reports that Kuwait
has deported Egyptian laborers involved in a recent street rioting
in the Gulf kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a committee meeting of the Shura (Consultative)
Council, Egypt's upper house of parliament, el-Amawi said "some
media have manipulated the issue as a material to irk the region."
</P>
<P>
There was "no political or security depth" behind the recent
unrest in Kuwait, the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
A quarrel between an Egyptian worker and a Bengali shop
assistant led to a serious street rioting in a suburb of Kuwait
City on October 30. This was believed to be the worse rioting in
the history of the Gulf country.
</P>
<P>
Immediately following the incident, Egyptian officials got in
touch with their Kuwaiti counterparts and expressed hope that the
incident would not affect the bilateral ties. Kuwaiti officials
assured them that the ties will remain normal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kuwaiti authorities have detained 25 Egyptian
workers involved in the unrest.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian official disclosed that 19 Egyptians are still in
custody pending further investigations into the incident.
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptian community is one of the best and most devoted in
the Arab world. Egyptian expatriate workers never interfere in the
policies of their host countries," el-Amawi said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldiers Dismantles Rogue Outpost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Under an order of Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) dismantled
early Wednesday morning the Maon Farm outpost set up by right-wing
Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
IDF officers, male and women soldiers and medical corps,
arrived early in the morning at the outpost, southeast of the West
Bank city of Hebron, and evacuated the settlers from the site, the
army said.
</P>
<P>
The eviction was met with some passive resistance from the
settlers, but no body was hurt during the operation, the army
added.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of settlers and right-wing activists from other parts
of Israel went to the site to show their support to the Maon Farm
settlers and stayed there overnight, but they did not intervene
when the settlers were being forced away.
</P>
<P>
The Maon Farm outpost was the last of the 12 hilltop
encampments of Jewish settlers which should be dismantled under an
agreement reached between Barak and settler leaders recently. The
others have already been evacuated by the settlers themselves.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return Tuesday night from Paris, France, Barak met
with Chief of General Staff Shaul Mofaz and Chief of Israeli
General Security Services Ami Ayalon to discuss the situation in
Maon Farm.
</P>
<P>
Barak ordered the IDF to implement the government's decision,
saying that illegal settlements will not be allowed.

<P>
CAIRO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian Commercial Office in Washington expects
Egypt's textile, ready-made clothes and yarn exports to the United
States to rise to 430 million U.S. dollars by the year end, as
compared to 389 million dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's Egyptian daily Alam Al Yom quoted Chief of the
office Assef Hassan as saying that exports of products which are
not subjects to quantitative restrictions, such as ready-made
clothes, yarn, textile, carpets, are steadily increasing.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian telecommunications authority has decided
to lower the charges of international telephone calls by 25
percent of the current tariff.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Fattah Abu Serie, chairman of the Egyptian
telecommunications company, said that the measure will cover
telephone calls between Egypt, on the one hand, and European,
Asian, American, Caribbean and Pacific Ocean countries and
Australia, on the other.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that internet rental charges will also be
lowered for companies by 25 to 50 percent of current
tariff, the Alam Al Yom said.
</P>
<P>
He further stated that the cost of local calls will remain
unchanged, emphasizing that the company is keen on providing
efficient service despite the reduction in charges.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The central council of the Bank of Lebanon has agreed
in principle to the merger of the United Bank of Lebanon and the
Lebanese Bank of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The new bank, named the New United Bank of Lebanon, will have a
capital of 80 million dollars, the Arabic daily Al Hayat said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The council's approval of the consolidation will legally
provide the merged bank with a soft loan of 47 billion liras (31
million dollars) with a maturity of eight years at 60 percent of
the interest of the treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iranian Deputy Energy Minister Rasul Zargar said
Wednesday that his ministry had signed an agreement with foreign
companies to complete the half-finished projects of two reservoir
dams.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian company along with Austrian and Swiss companies
will complete the Ustour dam in the northwestern province of East
Azarbaijan, Zargar was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning when and where the agreement was signed, he
said that an Iranian company and a Chinese financier would
complete Molla Sadra dam in the southern Fars province.
</P>
<P>
The Ustour reservoir dam is under construction with capacity
of 2 billion cubic meters to generate 160 megawatt of electricity
and Molla Sadra dam has been designed to reserve 400 million cubic
meters of water and generate 100 megawatt of electricity.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the Energy Ministry has been authorized
to enter into contracts valued at 300 million U.S. dollars with
foreign financiers to complete three projects. They are the Ustour
and Molla Sadra dams and a water supply project in Kerman
province.

<P>
TUNIS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Zine
Al-Abidine Ben Ali Wednesday reiterated his country's support for
the Middle East peace process, the Tunisia-Africa News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ali made the pledge during his talks with European Union
(EU) Special Envoy to Mideast Miguel Angel Moratinos over the
latest developments in the peace process on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Moratinos described it as "very fruitful" and
the role of Tunisia in the peace process as an "element of
moderation."
</P>
<P>
"As we are entering the final stage of the peace process, it is
highly important for the EU and Tunisia to exchange views and work
together to help achieve positive results for the people of the
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian-Israeli track of talks, the EU envoy said
the support of the EU and Tunisia is essential for that track,
saying that there is a specific agenda that has to be followed.
</P>
<P>
The talks also covered issues of common concern for the
Mediterranean region, he added, noting that Tunisia has played a
pivotal role in the region since the start of the "Barcelona
process."
</P>
<P>
The Barcelona process has to be given a new political momentum
to secure a bright future for the region featured by security and
stability, Moratinos added.
</P>
<P>
The European-Mediterranean Partnership, better known as the
"Barcelona process", involves the 15 EU member states and 12
countries along the southern Mediterranean basin. Its first
conference was held in Barcelona, Spain, in November 1995.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Y2K Won't Cause Major Breakdowns in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday reassured Americans that there will be "no major
national breakdowns" because of computer failures caused by the
year 2000 glitch.
</P>
<P>
"I expect we will experience no major national breakdowns as a
result of the year 2000 date change," Clinton told reporters on
the White House South Lawn.
</P>
<P>
"The American people can have full faith that everything from
air traffic control systems to Social Security payment systems
will work like they should," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton make the remarks after the President's Council on Year
2000 Conversion released its fourth and final report on the giant
computer reprogramming task that it called "the greatest
management challenge the world has faced since World War II."
</P>
<P>
But with only 51 days remaining, Clinton noted there are local
governments, schools, hospitals and small businesses that are
lagging behind on repairs. He cautioned them against delaying any
further and provided a toll-free telephone number for information
on becoming Y2K-compliant by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the best-prepared sectors continue to be
the federal government, power and water utilities, airlines and
rail companies and telephone services. It predicted a "high degree
of confidence" in those areas.
</P>
<P>
The new study also debunked worries about a misfired nuclear
missile.
</P>
<P>
"Y2K problems will not cause nuclear weapons to launch
themselves," the White House promised. "Nuclear weapons launch
requires human intervention."
</P>
<P>
But the council pointed out that surveys showed more than
one-fourth of small businesses don't plan to do anything to get
ready for the New Year's rollover.
</P>
<P>
Only half of America's 911 emergency call centers confirmed
last month they were ready, and more than one-third of the
country's elementary and secondary schools told the Education
Department they aren't yet prepared.
</P>
<P>
The study found most large U.S. trading partners were in good
shape, but Clinton said "we still have concerns about the Y2K
preparations of some developing nations" that he did not name.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Y2K problem exists because many older computers
and software programs recognize only the last two digits of the
year and could mistakenly interpret "00" as 1900.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Approves Measure Against Illegal Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate approved a
measure Wednesday to stiffen the penalty for the sale of powder
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
The measure, approved by a vote of 50-49, would reduce the
sentencing disparity between powder and crack cocaine by
tightening the penalty against dealers of the powder.
</P>
<P>
The measure would also increase penalties for sales of all
illegal drugs to minors and for selling them near schools and
other places where young people congregate.
</P>
<P>
"We must act to prevent our youth from ever starting down the
path of drug abuse," said the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman,
Orrin Hatch, who wrote the provision.
</P>
<P>
Under current law, a dealer who sells five grams of crack
cocaine will be sentenced to at least five years imprisonment
while the same sentence is triggered at 500 grams for powder
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
The new provision would narrow the disparity by reducing the
threshold amount for powder cocaine from 500 grams to 50 grams.

<HEADLINE> German May Succeed Camdessus: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Germany's red-green coalition
cabinet indicated Wednesday its Finance State Secretary Caio
Koch-Weser would bid for the top post in the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
After Michel Camdessus, the current IMF chief, announced he
would step down early next year "for personal reasons" in
Washington Tuesday evening, "a German has a good chance now," a
report by the Deutsche Presse Agentur (DPA) news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus has served in the international currency institution
for 12-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
Koch-Weser, 55, was an acknowledged financial expert and former
top manager of the World Bank. He was "valued" in Washington, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"There is still enough time to make a deal," the DPA quoted
sources in the ruling coalition as saying.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet failed to comment on any personal speculation but
said it would be in Germany's interest if a German were elected to
the post.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the German interest that the job is filled by the
right man or woman," said government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye at
a routine press briefing in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
"The federal government will be lucky if a German candidate is
supported by the majority in the IMF", he said.
</P>
<P>
German media also indicated other names, including Juergen
Stark, the vice president of the Bundesbank, Germany's central
bank.
</P>
<P>
Stark himself strongly demanded a German manage the IMF, saying
Germany, Eurpoe's largest economy, had been "under represented" in
the institution.
</P>
<P>
"It is too long that the Frenchman has been playing the leading
role in the IMF," Stark told the Suedwestrundfunk radio. But he
deliberately avoided to mention any name.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Wednesday hailed "Accessibility" as the theme of the
International Day of Disabled Persons, which is to be celebrated
on December 3.
</P>
<P>
"The theme for this year's observance of the International Day
of Disabled Persons -- Accessibility -- reminds us that for many
people with disabilities, the lack of access to essential services
remains a source of discrimination and lost opportunities," he
said in a message to mark the International Day.
</P>
<P>
"For more than half a billion people in the world,
accessibility can mean an education, a job and a community that
would otherwise be denied them" he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a key to the exercise of their civil, political, social
and cultural rights," he said. "This is a major concern of the
United Nations, rooted in its founding principle of the equality
of all human beings."
</P>
<P>
As computer-based communications and learning become more and
more widespread, special needs must be taken into account, he
said. "If they are not, the technological revolution will be lost
for many talented people, and their contributions will be lost to
the rest of us."
</P>
<P>
"But we must not forget that 80 percent of the world's disabled
population lives in developing countries," he said. "Most of them
have never used a phone, let alone a high-speed computer."
</P>
<P>
In many places, those who have become disabled as a result of
malnutrition, land-mine explosions or the acts of ruthless
terrorists need access to water, food and health care as a matter
of life and death, he said. "Meeting their basic needs must remain
our highest priority."
</P>
<P>
"Today, let us reaffirm our resolve to build truly accessible,
caring and inclusive societies in the new Millennium," he added.

<HEADLINE> S. African Gold Production Dips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's gold
production totalled 3,550,197 ounces (110,423.5 kilograms) for the
quarter ended September 30, a dip of 13,770 ounces or 0.39 percent
from the second quarter's 3,563,967 ounces.
</P>
<P>
The figures were reported by the South African Press
Association on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The lower output is a reflection of the gold price's dive to a
20-year low, strikes at various operations and seismic and other
underground events in the three months under review.
</P>
<P>
Year on year, the latest quarterly figure was down 4.4 percent,
while output in the nine months to date totalled 10,695,673 ounces
-- a drop of 3. 7 percent from 11,104,118 ounces over the same
period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The lower output was caused by the drop in the gold price to a
20-year low of 252.05 U.S. dollars after the Bank of England
conducted the first of its series of gold auctions on July 6, and
the industrial action of various mines in the run-up to conclusive
wage settlements.
</P>
<P>
However, wage negotiations are unlikely to cast as much of a
shadow next year as most mining companies have concluded a
two-year wage package.
</P>
<P>
Operators affected by strike action in the review period
include Gold Fields Ltd's Oryx, where an estimated 9,900 ounces of
gold production was lost, and Durban Roodepoort Deep's
Hartebeestfontein, which lost some 12, 860 to 14,460 ounces of
output.
</P>
<P>
Roger Baxter, head of economics at the Chamber of Mines,
predicts that the total production for 1999 will be some 450 tons
(about 14,468,000 ounces), slightly down from the 466 tons (about
14,982,000 ounces) in 1998.

<P>
KATHMANDU, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Nepal and India have moved
one step forward toward joint developing and utilizing their
common boundary river.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Nepal and India agreed to open a joint
project office in Kathmandu for investigations of the Pancheshwar
project and completing the detailed project report (DPR) in the
end, said a press release issued by the Indian embassy here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Mahakali Treaty signed by Nepal and India in
1996, the two countries decided to launch the Pancheshwar
multi-purpose project for joint utilization of the boundary
Mahakali river.
</P>
<P>
But a joint DPR, which will serve as the guidelines of the
project, can not be finalized as the two countries can not reach
an agreement on the details of the project, such as its costs and
magnitude, or even how to share the benefits of the completed
project.
</P>
<P>
The joint project office is the first step for DPR and will
function under the direction of the joint group of experts of
Nepal and India constituted for the purpose by the two
governments, said the release.

<HEADLINE> Officials Call for Attention to Mental Illnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Health Minister Zhang Wenkang
today called on society to pay more attention to the harmfulness
mental illnesses have brought about to people's health, saying
some 16 million people in China are suffering from mental
disorders, mostly schizophrenia and depression.
</P>
<P>
Zhang disclosed the figure in Beijing today while addressing
the World Health Organization's Mental Health Awareness Raising
Conference.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Conference, vice premier Li Lanqing
emphasized the importance of helping people keep physically active
and psychologically stable to maintain a harmonious society in
China.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, behavioral problems in children, alcohol
dependence, narcotic addiction, suicides, mental illness among
China's elderly as well as psychological problems of middle school
and college students have been increasing since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Zhang attributed the increase to the rapid economic and social
development of China, more psychological pressures placed on
people because of acute competition and an ever-increasing
population among the elderly.
</P>
<P>
A World Health Organization (WHO) estimate suggests that mental
illness patients account for 14.3 percent of the total number of
patients in China and the percentage is expected to reach 17.4
percent by 2020.
</P>
<P>
Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, director-general of the (WHO), said
that mental health is the most important health issue for people,
stressing that improvement of the mental health is a priority of
WHO.
</P>
<P>
Today's conference is an obvious step forward for China and the
WHO in dealing with mental illnesses. According to official
figures, China has established 575 psychiatric and rehabilitation
facilities, with 110,000 beds and a staff of about 900,000.
</P>
<P>
Some local officials and experts are dissatisfied with the
present state of mental health in China, saying that little public
attention is given to mental disorders. For many years, there has
been a severe lack of public education on mental problems,
contributing to serious social prejudices against mental patients.
</P>
<P>
Local officials and experts agreed that China also lacks mental
health professionals, clinical psychologists and social workers.
They called for greater efforts to prevent and cure mental
illnesses.

The 15-member European bloc has finalized its new banana import
proposals in the hope of satisfying Americans, Latin Americans and
the WTO's dispute settlement body. The proposals, announced by the
European Commission in Brussels on Wednesday, are designed to
bring the EU's current controversial banana regime in line with
the WTO rules and lead to the lifting of about 200 million U.S.
dollars in sanctions imposed by the United States early this year.

<HEADLINE> Oil Revenues to Account for 40 Percent of UAE GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Obeid bin Saif Al Nasir,
minister of petroleum and mineral resources of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE)), has indicted that oil revenues will account for
about 40 percent of the country's Gross Domestic Products in 1999
due to the rise of oil prices.
</P>
<P>
While it is difficult to predict oil prices, they are expected
to average around 18 U.S dollars per barrel this year and stay at
current levels until March 2000, the minister was quoted by the
Gulf News Agency as saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He expected the country's oil revenues to reach about 19.9
billion dollars this year, 40 percent of the estimated GDP of
49.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the UAE Central Bank data, oil revenues of the
country totaled 10.1 billion dollars last year, contributing
around 21.8 percent to the GDP of 46.3 billion dollars. In 1997,
oil had contributed 14.6 billion dollars, or 29.6 percent, to the
year's GDP of 49.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Officials had attributed the overall 5.81 percent GDP decline
last year to the decline in oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
Nasir observed that current oil price levels can be
maintained even beyond March 2000, provided strong control is
maintained

<P>
HONG KONG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Commissioner for
Narcotics Clarie Lo Thursday strongly refuted U.S. claim that Hong
Kong is among the world's major drug transit countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
In response to U.S. President Bill Clinton's claim made in a
letter to the Congress on November 10, Lo said that the
importation of dangerous drugs into Hong Kong and their re-export
to the U.S. using both land and sea routes has virtually vanished
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1997, there were no seizures of dangerous drugs destined
for the U.S. which came from Hong Kong," Lo said.
</P>
<P>
"There is also no evidence that dangerous drugs are transiting
Hong Kong on the way to the U.S. in quantities that have a
significant impact on the consumption and availability of those
drugs in the U.S.," she added.
</P>
<P>
"In the latest U.N. report issued in March 1999, there was no
suggestion that Hong Kong was being used as a major transit point
for opiates, cocaine, cannabis or other drugs," the commissioner
said.
</P>
<P>
"In its past annual reports, the U.N. International Narcotics
Control Board also complimented Hong Kong for providing
comprehensive information on all exports of scheduled precursor
chemicals," added Lo.

<P>
ABU DHABI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
will soon start working on setting up a Textile Village, which will
offer bonded custom warehousing and showroom facilities to textile
traders.
</P>
<P>
The village will be located in UAE's second largest emirate, Dubai,
and the project is currently being piloted by the Dubai Customs, the
Gulf News daily reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a strategic project for us. Land has already been
allocated for the proposed project, which will offer 6 million square
meters of space to prospective investors from the textile industry,"
Dr. Obeid Saqr Busit, director-general of the Dubai Customs and
chairman of the UAE Customs Council, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Dubai Textile Village will be the second such facility in the
world after a similar one at Napoli in Italy.
</P>
<P>
"We have heard that South Korea is also embarking on a similar project,
but we plan to go ahead with them," he added.
</P>
<P>
The village will offer "total" exemption of customs duties,
long-term (15 years) leasing contract and re-export facilities, but no
manufacturing facility.
</P>
<P>
"Our first task now will be to sit down with Dubai textile traders'
umbrella organization Texmas and leaders of the concerned industry to work
out details," Dubai Customs officials said.

<HEADLINE> China Sets up First Ophthalmic Treatment and Eye Disease Data Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- China has set up two data banks
on ophthalmic treatment techniques and eye disease in Hubei
Province.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the International Agency for Prevention of
Blindness claim that they are the first data banks of their kind
in the world.
</P>
<P>
The data banks established under "Sight First China Operation,"
the world's biggest blindness prevention and treatment campaign,
collected files conducted from a national survey in 1997 and 1998
on information of eye patients and oculists, and the location of
ophthalmic hospitals.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, China has some 9 million eye patients
with 4 million of them suffering from cataracts, accounting for 20
percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
There are 400,000 new cataract patients in China. Only half of
them can be cured with the country's present ophthalmic surgery
techniques, said Zhang Wenbin, a professor from Tongji Medical
Sciences University in Shanghai, who is also a co-designer of the
data banks.
</P>
<P>
The data banks will provide reliable information resources and
accumulate research on advanced eye disease treatment, said James
Owen, director of the International Association of Lion Clubs. The
Lion Club works closely with "Sight First China Operation."

<HEADLINE> Former Pak PM Likely to be Shifted to Karachi for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's deposed prime
minister Nawaz Sharif is likely to be shifted to Karachi in the
next few days to stand trial to be conducted in the provincial
capital of Sindh, informed sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sharif and four others were formally booked at an
anti-terrorist court in Karachi late Wednesday night on charges of
attempted murder and hijacking a Pakistan International Airlines
(PIA) aircraft on October 12 as well as "criminal conspiracy and
common intent."
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister and some of his close allies have
been kept in custody at unknown places since the army dismissed
the civilian government in a coup on October 12.
</P>
<P>
The army authorities are making arrangements for the venue of
the trial and Sharif will probably be brought in a special army
plane under tight security of commandos to Karachi, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
Along with the deposed prime minister, others indicted were
former adviser to him for Sindh affairs Ghous Ali Shah,
ex-chairman of PIA Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, former director general
of Civil Aviation Authority Aminullah Chaudhry and former
inspector general of Sindh police Rana Maqbool Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
The case was registered on the complaint of Lt. Colonel
Atiquzzaman Kiani of five corps Headquarters under certain
Pakistani penal laws.
</P>
<P>
According to legal experts, some of the charges carry the death
penalty under the laws.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Colonel Kiani in his complaint maintained that PIA flight
PK-805, coming from Colombo, with Chief of the Army Staff General
Pervaiz Musharraf and over 200 other passengers on board, was
denied landing at the Karachi Airport.
</P>
<P>
All lights and signals to escort the plane were turned off at
the tarmac and barricades erected on the runway to prevent it from
landing at the airport. The aircraft was about to run short of
fuel and could fly for another seven minutes only when it finally
landed safely after the army controlled the airport.

BUDAPEST, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin said Chechnya is an inalienable part of Russia and
that the Russian government will not negotiate with Chechen
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian newspaper People's Voice carried his statement
Thursday. Putin was quoted as saying Chechnya had actually been in
a state of independence, but the terrorists were not satisfied.
They launched aggression against other republics, attempting to
occupy more territory. Their terrorist explosions have killed
about 1,500 civilians.
</P>
<P>
If the bases of Chechen terrorists were not smashed Russia
would never have tranquillity, he was quoted as saying. The
Russian government will not hold talks with the terrorists, he
said.

The Russian Prime Minister also slashed out at foreign forces'
interference in Russia's action in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
He said these political forces do not want to see a powerful
Russia. They offered their immense financial resources to those
opponents of the Russian government to undermine and weaken the

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on System of People's Congresses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC),
said here today that the work of the people's congresses practiced
during the past 45 years indicates a people's democratic system
that accords with actual conditions in China and embodies the
wishes of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Li made the statement in an interview with reporters from the "
China's People's Congress," a publication sponsored by the NPC
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
This year is the 45th anniversary of the founding of the people
's congresses and also the 20th anniversary of the establishment
of standing committees in people's congresses at local levels.
</P>
<P>
The system of people's congresses has people congresses as its
cornerstones, Li said, and it defines the relationship between the
people's congresses and the people who elect them, the
relationship between the people's congresses and the governments,
people's courts and people's procuratorates at all levels, as well
as the relationship between the Communist Party of China and the
people's congresses and government bodies.
</P>
<P>
To sum up in one sentence, the system of people's congresses is
an organizational form of political power in realizing the
leadership by the Communist Party of China and the rule of the
people, and is a political advantage and characteristic of China,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed the importance of adhering to the Party leadership,
saying that the people's congresses are subject to the leadership
of the Party and translate the Party guidelines into laws,
resolutions and decisions.
</P>
<P>
The chairman called for greater attention to the enforcement of
laws and supervision of law enforcement, which he said are weak
links that should be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that greater publicity is needed for the
work by the people's congresses and for increasing public
awareness of democracy and the rule of law so as to successfully
transform the nation into one that is governed according to law.

<HEADLINE> Reports Say Clinton Will Visit Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will visit the Yugoslav province of Kosovo during his coming tour
of Europe after a decision to shorten his visit to Greece because
of security concerns, U.S. media reported.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post Thursday quoted administration officials as
saying that Clinton will likely visit the U.S. military base in
southern-central Kosovo known as Camp Bondsteel, a site surrounded
by barbed wire, concrete barriers and guard towers.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government is expected to object to the visit. A
Yugoslav diplomat at the United Nations said, "Kosovo is not an
independent state that anybody can just jump in."
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report said Clinton has wanted to visit
Kosovo ever since the U.S.-led NATO ended its bombing on
Yugoslavia in June.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the Kosovo visit probably would be limited to a
matter of hours at the end of his European trip, which begins
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had originally planned to visit Greece this weekend and
stay there for two nights, but had to delay and shorten it at the
recommendation of the Greek government due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
According to the new itinerary, Clinton will leave Sunday and
visit Greece on November 18 and 19. The trip will bring the
president to Bulgaria, Italy and Turkey, where he will attend a
summit of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to return to Washington on November 23.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Five persons were killed and
three others wounded in an ambush staged by a tribal group in the
southern Philippines Wednesday, a military report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The victims were among the 25 people on board a tractor when
they were waylaid by 10 natives reportedly led by a certain
village, Talaingod, Davao del Norte Wednesday morning, the
military report noted.
</P>
<P>
Initial investigation said motive of the ambush was believed to
be tribal rivalry. Warring tribal groups in Davao and other places
in Mindanao are common. In most cases, these had resulted into a
bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
Aggrieved tribal leaders seek for revenge following the tragic

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Transatlantic Banana Row Tests EU Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's reform
proposal for its banana import system fails so far to appease the
United States and some Latin American banana producers, leaving
the transatlantic banana row further intensified and the 15 EU
nations in a major test before a ministerial meeting in Seattle of
the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The 15-member European bloc has finalized its new banana import
proposals in the hope of satisfying Americans, Latin Americans and
the WTO's dispute settlement body. The proposals, announced by the
European Commission in Brussels on Wednesday, are designed to
bring the EU's current controversial banana regime in line with
the WTO rules and lead to the lifting of about 200 million U.S.
dollars in sanctions imposed by the United States early this year.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, calls for the
EU nations to accept a tariff-only banana import system by January
1, 2006 after a transitional period involving a complex tariff
rate quota system. But the United States and the world's largest
banana growers in Latin America said the proposal would not meet
the WTO rules. Trade officials in Washington said the U.S.
sanctions on EU exports concerned would remain in place.
</P>
<P>
The EU believes the proposal of interim changes to quota regime
before introducing a tariff-only system will accord with the WTO
rules. To coordinate different stances, the EU has tried to
persuade its relevant member countries to accept the formula
through compromises.
</P>
<P>
Under the current import regime, the EU's quotas and tariffs
protect Spanish, Portuguese and French producers in their former
overseas territories as well as traditional importers from a host
of African, Caribbean and Pacific nations (ACPs).
</P>
<P>
The EU has been under pressure to overhaul its banana rules
since the WTO authorized Washington to impose 100-percent punitive
tariffs on a range of European goods in April.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive's reform plan for banana rules has caused
heated debate among EU member states, with some seeking a more
market-oriented solution which would provide cheaper bananas to
consumers as soon as possible and others looking for a way to
avoid sanctions against some market-sensitive products. "It was a
heated discussion," said Bernhard Zepter, EU executive's deputy
secretary general, who drafted the plan.
</P>
<P>
The plan still has to be assessed by the governments of 15 EU
members and the European Parliament, the EU's supervisory and co-
decision-making branch. The EU foreign affairs ministers will
discuss the issue in Brussels next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The issue has overshadowed the EU-U.S. trade relations for
years and the WTO has ruled several times that EU's banana import
regime is discriminatory. However, it had been hoped that a
solution would be found before the WTO's Seattle meeting from
November 30 to December 3, when world's trade partners are
expected to launch a new round of global trade talks.
</P>
<P>
EU officials have said the banana reform deal was unlikely to
emerge before the end of the month. Therefore, there will be a
crucial test ahead for the European countries to find ways to
reach face-saving concessions with their trade competitors and to
shun another fiasco in WTO's forthcoming round of multilateral
trade talks.

<HEADLINE> Britain Falls Silent to Remember War Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Millions of people throughout
Britain fell silent for two minutes Thursday to remember those who
lost their lives in this century's wars.
</P>
<P>
The Queen Mother led Britain in two minutes' silence to
remember the dead of this century's wars.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was even more poignant than usual, marking the
last Remembrance Day of a century which saw millions of British
and Commonwealth soldiers give up their lives in action.
</P>
<P>
The silence was observed at airports, railway stations,
supermarkets and banks, with veterans' association the Royal
British Legion estimating as many as 85 percent of the adult
population -- 50 million people -- observed the silence this year.
</P>
<P>
As Big Ben chimed out the hour on the parliament buildings,
customers and workers in banks, supermarkets and offices stood
silently to mark the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month
of 1918 when the armistice was signed to end World War One.
</P>
<P>
A Remembrance Day parade is also planned in London Sunday, when
veterans will be joined for the first time by members of the
unofficial army of "land girls" who worked on farms while men were
away fighting in World War Two.
</P>
<P>
The annual march past the Cenotaph, which follows the laying of
wreaths by the royal family and political leaders, traditionally
included only former members of the armed forces or other
organizations under military command.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- China's top arms control official assailed the United States
on Wednesday for its campaign to develop a shield against
ballistic nuclear missiles, warning that such a program could lead
to a nuclear arms race and dangerously alter the strategic balance
in Asia and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
-- Congressional Republicans and the White House tentatively
agreed Wednesday night on a nearly 1.4 billion dollar plan to hire
new teachers and reduce class size, clearing away one of the major
obstacles to a final compromise on the budget.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Almost a month after he was ousted from power in a swift
bloodless coup, Pakistan's deposed prime minister, Nawaz Sharif,
has been charged with hijacking and kidnapping for what military
officials say was his treasonous refusal to allow a plane carrying
the army chief to land at an airport in the port city of Karachi.
</P>
<P>
-- The first unusual event in the flight of EgyptAir 990 on Oct.
31 was the autopilot's disconnecting and then, about eight seconds
later, what appeared at first to be "a controlled descent"that was
smooth and straight. Aviation experts said such a descent would be
very unlikely unless the pilots were still flying the plane.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said the company isn't willing
to give up its control over the way computer makers display
Windows, raising a possible obstacle to any antitrust settlement.
Addressing shareholders, he called himself "pragmatic" and said he
is willing to compromise in order to settle the government's suit.
</P>
<P>
-- Heart researchers said ACE inhibitors, a widely used class
of blood-pressure medications, helped reduce heart attacks,strokes
and even diabetes. Separately, a stress-test imaging agent was
found useful in diagnosing heart attacks.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Election Agreement to Be Signed on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a press briefing ahead of the Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meeting in the Indian Ocean port city of Durban, South
Africa, Anyaoku said the agreement had not been signed last Friday
as scheduled because southern African leaders involved in
restoring order in Lesotho could not attend the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy won the poll in May
last year, but opposition parties rejected the results of the
election, claiming the poll had been rigged.
</P>
<P>
These claims triggered prolonged protests which escalated into
anarchy, prompting Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili to ask the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) to help restore
order.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique were mandated
by SADC to intervene, and in conjunction with a Commonwealth
special envoy, they held marathon discussions with all political
parties in Lesotho and ultimately brokered the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The deal provides for general elections in the tiny, landlocked
country next year with the voting date be set later.

<HEADLINE> Bank Governor Urges Greater Support for Small Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Bank (
SDB), the largest policy bank in China, is expected to lend
greater support to the country's medium- and small-sized
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The bank's governor, Chen Yuan, made this pledge today at an
ongoing international symposium on the financing of these
enterprises, which was jointly sponsored by the SDB and a German
bank.
</P>
<P>
The symposium highlighted the topic of adopting multiple
measures in finance, tax, and law and technique to help expand
fund-raising channels for medium- and small-sized firms in China.
</P>
<P>
These businesses have contributed about 75 percent of the newly
created jobs in Chinese cities and townships during the past two
decades, helping to settle the nearly 300 million idle rural
laborers. Of the nation's 150 million-strong industrial workforce,
110 million are working in such firms.
</P>
<P>
These businesses also contributed about 76.7 percent of the
newly created industrial output value during the 1990s, and about
60 percent of the nation's current export turnover.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the progress this sector has made, medium- and
small-sized firms are facing a number of difficulties,
predominately a shortages of funds.
</P>
<P>
China's banking sector should address the financing problem
facing the smaller firms, and the SDB will join forces with
commercial banks to establish a special financial service system
targeting such businesses, according to the SDB governor.

<HEADLINE> WHO to Combat Global Problem of Mental Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Mental disorders are believed
to be on the rise worldwide, compelling the World Health
Organization (WHO) to take drastic measures to combat it.
</P>
<P>
The organization's director-general announced here today that
WHO will launch a global campaign to improve mental health
services, including mental health surveys and the overall
improvement of the mental care systems around the world,
specifically targeting depression, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and
suicide prevention.
</P>
<P>
The WHO decided to take the measures because mental disorders
have become a "grave" problem, said director-general Gro H.
Brundtland, who is in Beijing to attend the China/WHO Mental
Health Awareness Conference.
</P>
<P>
Five of the ten leading causes of disability worldwide are
mental problems, namely depression, schizophrenia, bipolar
disorders, alcohol abuse, and obsessive compulsive disorders,
Brundtland said, adding that there are 340 million cases of major
depressive disorders, 45 million cases of schizophrenia, and
between 10 million and 20 million attempted suicides worldwide
every year.
</P>
<P>
Serious depression will become the second most serious medical
problem globally by the year 2020, she said, but one third of the
world's population, particularly those in rural areas, has no
access to drugs for treating this disorder.
</P>
<P>
"I was convinced that the WHO should devote considerable
energy to addressing the challenges posed by mental disorders,"
said Dr. Brundtland, because "mental health is the central part of
overall health."
</P>
<P>
However, Dr. Benedetto Saraceno, director of WHO's Department
of Mental Health, acknowledged that some barriers still need to be
overcome before effective prevention and treatment of mental
problems can be provided to everyone.
</P>
<P>
The priority given to mental health remains low on most public
health agendas, and this has obvious consequences for budgets and
policy planning, and stigma and discrimination toward persons with
mental disorders is still widespread, according to the director.
</P>
<P>
The WHO will conduct a Mental Health Survey 2000 aimed at
obtaining empirical data for deciding how best to deal with the
increasing burden of mental disorders in different parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
Through this survey in 19 countries, including China, the WHO
will gather data on both mental and physical disorders and
disability, work-time lost, risk factors, and service utilization
and medications, said Dr. Brundtland.
</P>
<P>
The WHO will reach out to secure the commitment and
involvement of other key international organizations, professional
organizations, international non-governmental organizations, and
the private sector in this effort, she said.

<HEADLINE> Sudan's Opposition to Weigh Egyptian-Libyan Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese opposition is to
discuss an Egyptian-Libyan peace plan for Sudan later this month
and is expected to form a final stand on it, a leading Sudanese
opposition member said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has decided to
meet on November 22 in Kampala, Uganda, to discuss the
multilateral efforts aimed at helping realize peace in Sudan, said
Ibrahim al Amin, senior member of the Ummah Party, which forms
part of the NDA.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will focus on the Egyptian-Libyan plan and the role
played by the Eastern African Inter-Governmental Authority on
Development (IGAD) in mediating between the Sudanese government
and the southern rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), al
Amin told Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The NDA groups Muslim political parties, which want to share
power with Sudan's Islamic government, and the SPLA, which has
been fighting a 16-year-old war for greater autonomy for the
mostly Christian south.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese opposition is allowed to carry out activities in
Egypt, which is keen on mediating a solution to Sudan's conflict.
Cairo fears that a possible disintegration of its southern
neighbor may endanger the Nile, its major water source.
</P>
<P>
Al Amin underlined his party's support for the Egyptian-Libyan
initiative, which he said forms a basis for the peace process in
Sudan as it is comprehensive and offers an opportunity for the
related parties to work out the principles for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
"This initiative deals with all aspects of the Sudanese issue,
enabling all sides related to the Sudanese issue and neighboring
Arab and African countries to participate in the settlement
efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya proposed in August the peace plan, which calls
for a permanent cease-fire in Sudan and a meeting of the
preparatory committee for the convocation of a peace conference to
be attended by all parties.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government and the opposition Muslim parties have
accepted the proposal while the rebel SPLA has expressed
reservations. John Garang, the SPLA leader, said his group favors
IGAD's mediation role.
</P>
<P>
IGAD also maintains that the Sudanese conflict could not be
solved militarily and demands all parties to seek a peaceful
settlement.

<HEADLINE> Memorial Meeting for Norman Bethune Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua)-- Dr. Norman Bethune was truly an
internationalist, Michael Copeland, president of the Federation of
Canada-China Friendship Associations, said here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a meeting marking the 60th anniversary
of the death of the great international fighter, an event
organized by the China Society for the People's Friendship Studies.
</P>

"It is important to remember Dr. Norman Bethune's bright deeds
and noble spirit as we enter a new century," said Ling Qing, vice-
president of the Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
The name of Bethune will live in the hearts of the Chinese
people forever, Ling said.
</P>
<P>
Leading a medical team, Dr. Bethune came to China in 1937 and
worked hard to treat the wounded soldiers of the Eighth Route Army,
which was led by the Communist Party of China during the war
against the Japanese invaders.
</P>
<P>
In 1939, Dr. Bethune died because of an infection from a
wounded Eighth Route Army soldier on whom he made an operation.
</P>
<P>
The Benerotary International Corp. Ltd. China Branch, a co-
sponsor of the event, announced at the meeting that the company
will produce a TV series on the life of Dr. Bethune.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by nearly 300 people from China and
Canada.

GAZA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Nabil Abu Redina, adviser of the
Palestinian National Authority, reiterated that the United Nations
Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 as well as the principle
of land-for-peace constitute red lines for the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with "Voice of Palestine" radio Thursday, Abu
Redina said the ongoing final status negotiations are a test of
Israeli government's attitudes towards implementing the signed
agreements and its commitment to peace.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States' follow-up and sponsoring of the
talks would help activate and enhance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Sunday the two
U.N. resolutions did not apply to the Palestinian case, claiming
that they were related to only the conflict between Israel and
Arab sovereign states such as Syria and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
But he backed away from this position in the wake of
Palestinian and U.S. rejection of his interpretations.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released Tuesday by the Israeli Prime
Minister's Office, Barak agreed Monday evening that resolution 242
would be the grounds for negotiations with the Palestinians,
"though it was clear that it would be changed in the course of
agreement."
</P>
<P>
Uolutions.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the "Sharm el-Sheikh memorandum included a
phrase to the effect that the two parties reaffirm their
understanding that negotiations and the final solution will lead
to the application of Security Council resolutions 242 and 338."

<P>
The final status talks, officially initiated Monday, were
resumed on Thursday in the West Bank city of Ramallah.

CAIRO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Tourists visiting Egypt during the January-September
period this year stood at 3.5 million, and tourism incomes jumped
to over 3.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Arab economic daily "Alam Al Yom," quoted a report
by the Ministry of Tourism as saying that the increase was mainly
attributed to the success of promotion efforts by the Ministry of
Tourism in major tourist markets, particularly in European
countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Abu Dhabi Development Fund has decided to
offer 148 million dollars of loans to four Syrian projects in the
field of infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"Alam Al Yom" reported that the biggest loan, amounting to 70
million dollars, will be earmarked for the construction of a
textile factory and the second loan of 30 million dollars will be
used in establishing an electricity generating plant.
</P>
<P>
The third loan of 30 million dollars will be allocated for a
potable water plant and the fourth loan, 18 million dollars, will
go for modernizing the electricity network.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- Talks are under way between Iraq and world companies
to overhaul Iraqi civilian aircraft to make them operational as
soon as the international embargo against Iraq is lifted.
</P>
<P>
"Alam Al Yom" quoted the manager of the Iraqi airways Rabie
Mohamed Saleh as saying that overhauling work undertaken by the
French Airbus company is progressing and that several planes will
be ready for operation.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraqi aircraft are in need of thorough examination
in view of the long period of inaction.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- An official report by the Egyptian labor attache's
office in Sanaa reveals that highly skilled and qualified Egyptian
labour occupy the first place among foreign workers in Yemen,
despite competition from other countries.
</P>
<P>
"Alam Al Yom" quoted the report as saying that there are no
accurate figures of the Egyptian labour force in Yemen. It
attributed this to the fact that entry to Yemen does not require
special visa.

<HEADLINE> Russian Supreme Court to Rule on Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Constitutional
Court Thursday opened hearings over the Federation Council's
inquiry about the legitimacy of President Boris Yeltsin's decision
to suspend prosecutor-general Yuri Skuratov.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin suspended Skuratov from his duties on April 2 following
the initiation of criminal proceedings against Skuratov. But that
was done without consultations with the Federation Council, the
upper house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian Constitution, the prosecutor-general should
be appointed and dismissed by the Federation Council on the
president's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
Three times this year, in March, April and October, the
Federation Council considered the president's request for
dismissing the prosecutor-general but did not endorse his ruling.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Constitutional Court Marat Baglai earlier told
reporters that the court's decision on the so-called Skuratov case
will in no way influence the outcome of this matter.
</P>
<P>
"The prosecutor-general's dismissal is stipulated in clear
terms in the Constitution and cannot be a matter of dispute:
whatever the Constitutional Court decides, the prosecutor-general
can only be dismissed by the Federation Council," he said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Children Hacked Dead in Central Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Two sisters, 6- and 7-years
old, and their 6-year-old cousin were found hacked to death in a
ravine in a village of the Visayas of the Philippines Wednesday
night, reports reached here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine News Agency quoted local policemen as saying that
they believed there was a struggle between the attacker and one of
the children, 7-year-old girl Gina Sumayang, because she was found
clutching a handful of long hair in her hand.
</P>
<P>
Whoever killed the three remained unknown, the PNA said, adding
that neither the parents of the children nor local officials have
any suspect in mind.
</P>
<P>
The three children were sent out to gather firewood shortly
before lunch Wednesday. The area where they were found was
familiar to them but is not frequented by residents, a village
leader said.
</P>
<P>
About 1 o'clock in the afternoon, a neighbor informed the two
sisters' mother that he heard shouts of children above the ravine.
The murder was confirmed after the mother sent another daughter to
check.
</P>
<P>
The sack of firewood they had gathered was found several meters
away from their bodies. The children's fathers are construction
workers and both families get their food and other needs by
selling firewood.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Urged to Expand Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) should expand its share of world
trade in general and export capacity in particular when the
regional grouping is progressing toward a Free Trade Area on
October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Zambian acting minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry
Syamukayumbu Syamujaye made the call in a speech at the opening of
the Eighth Meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee of COMESA in
Lusaka on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that sustainable growth must by linked to improved
export performance and increasing competitiveness of COMESA's
products in the international market.
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, that domestic markets are constrained by
small size in the population and economies of individual member
states.
</P>
<P>
Sub-Sahara Africa's contribution to world trade remains
insignificant. " Not only are our exports to the international
market small in absolute terms but the emerging picture indicates
a worsening trend if nothing is done," he said.
</P>
<P>
This gloomy picture must not be allowed to continue in the new
 millennium, he added.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of COMESA, Erastus Mwencha, said he was
confidant that the COMESA Free Trade Area will be attained. The
20-member COMESA was transformed from the Preferential Trade Area
for the Eastern and Southern Africa in December 1993 with its
headquarters in Zambian capital Lusaka.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- About 1,100 civil servants
of Hong Kong Thursday began to accept training for the special
task of counting ballot papers in the district councils election
on November 28.
</P>
<P>
They will be deployed to 18 district counting stations across
Hong Kong and work overnight after polling closes at 10:30 PM
until election results are known, said a government spokesman.
</P>
<P>
A demonstration of how to count votes was conducted to give
them a feel of the standard counting procedure.
</P>
<P>
The Registration and Electoral Office will arrange further
training sessions for the staff in the coming two weeks to let
them try out for themselves how to set up a counting station and
count ballots.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the civil servants at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium,
Chief Electoral Officer Li Wing said the counting of votes must be
conducted in an open and transparent manner.
</P>
<P>
"Candidates, election and counting agents, members of the
public and the media will be present at designated areas in the
counting stations to monitor the entire process," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said a central co-ordination center would be set up at the
Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center in Wan Chai on the
polling day to keep in close touch with the 18 district stations
and to disseminate election results to the public.

<HEADLINE> China's Political System With Chinese Characteristics (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- China's people's congress
system is a people's democratic system with Chinese
characteristics introduced 45 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, made the remark during an exclusive interview
with "China's People's Congress", an official bulletin under the
NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Li quoted President Jiang Zemin as saying, "To adhere to and
improve the people's congress system is most important in building
a socialist democratic politics."
</P>
<P>
To adhere to and improve the system is a powerful weapon for
China to counterattack western nations that have been advocating
parliamentary democracy and trying to westernize and decentralize
the country, and for China to ensure its stability, national unity,
economic development and social progress, the top lawmaker
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The people's congress system is the State power system with the
people's congress as the stone, under which the people are their
own master, Li said, adding that the people's congress system in
China is a system which is unique to China and is different to
multiparty and power-sharing systems in the West.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the relations between the Communist Party of China
(CPC) and the people's congress, Li termed it as being "very
important".
</P>
<P>
The people's congress has to work under the leadership of the
CPC, while the CPC, the ruling party, turns its proposals through
legal procedures into the will of the State and the action of the
people, Li Peng said.

<P>
However, Li reiterated that the ruling party as well as all non-
communist parties, social groups and all the citizens must abide
by the laws and other legal resolutions and to act within the laws.
</P>
<P>
The people's congress, the government, the court and the
procuratorate, are all working for the same one purpose to build
socialism with Chinese characteristics, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The people's congress can play a big role in helping strengthen
ties between the Party and the people, the NPC chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Li went on to talk about the importance of governing the nation
by law, saying it is the fundamental requirement of the CPC. Laws
have unified the Party's leadership and developed people's
democracy.
</P>
<P>
The top lawmaker emphasized that the people's congress system
ensures that the Party will always assume the overall
responsibility and play a central role in coordinating different
parties and sectors.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee chairman, who took office in March
last year, stressed that it is equally important for the people's
congress to play a supervisory and legislative role. He disclosed
that the NPC Standing Committee is now drafting laws concerning
the supervision of judicial departments as well as government
departments in charge of economic and financial plans.
</P>
<P>
Li urged to increase the public awareness about the importance
of legal work in China among officials and ordinary Chinese. Many
Chinese often approach ranking officials for help, rather than
going to court, he said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, U.S. Discuss Trade Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and the United States
discussed a preliminary framework and prospect of a new round of
multilateral trade negotiations to be launched later this month at
the annual meeting of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the
official Thai News Agency (TNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
TNA quoted Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister
Supachai Panitchpakdi as saying Thursday that the two sides talked
about three major issues, namely the liberalization of farm
products, labor-related trade issues and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
For the proposed liberalization of farm products, Washington
and Bangkok had a similar view that the new round of world trade
talks should emphasize reduction of subsidies on key farm products
and cancellation of quota systems to prevent and stop price
distortion, TNA said.
</P>
<P>
As for labor issues related with trade, the United States had
proposed that the WTO set up a new panel to oversee the matter.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the European Union have agreed that the
International Labor Organization (ILO) participates in the
upcoming WTO meeting as an observer.
</P>
<P>
In case of environmental protection, Supachai said he had
agreed with the U.S. and other developed countries that
environmental protection and world trade should be separated, as
the former was part of agreement outside the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Supachai and U.S. ambassador to Thailand, Richard Hecklinger,
held talks on trade issues on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, who will head WTO three years later, said he had
asked Washington to play a leading role in pushing for trade
privileges for developing and least developed countries in form of
reduced import tariffs from richer trade partners.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador, meanwhile, expressed his country's
willingness to share information and send experts on genetically
modified organisms to Thailand to help train local officials.

<HEADLINE> World Anti-Doping Agency Established </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Anti-Doping Agency (
WADA) was established Wednesday in its provisional seat of
Lausanne, according to a press release by the International
Olympic Committee (IOC).
</P>
<P>
WADA's board will be composed of at least ten members and no
more than 35. The Olympic Movement and the public authorities will
each be able to appoint a maximum of 16 members. Other members may
be appointed by a consensus of the board.
</P>
<P>
The board will see to it that, when appointing new members, the
parity between the public authorities and the Olympic Movement is
maintained. Members are appointed to a three year term, which is
renewable twice.
</P>
<P>
WADA's board so far includes representatives from the Member
States of the European Union, the Supreme Council for Sport in
Africa, and the Olympic Movement.
</P>
<P>
For the Olympic Movement:
</P>
<P>
Representing the International Olympic Committee: Richard Pound,
first vice president; Arne Ljungqvist, member; Prince Alexandre de
Merode, member; and Jacques Rogge, member;
</P>
<P>
Representing the International Sports Federations: Hein
Verbruggen, president, International Cycling Union, and Anders
Besseberg, president, International Biathlon Union;
</P>
<P>
Representing the athletes: Elected members to the Athletes
Commission, Robert Ctvrtlik, USA indoor volleyball; Manuela
DiCenta, Italy, cross country skiing; and Johann Olav Koss, Norway,
speed skating; and Peter Tallberg, chairman, Athletes Commission.
</P>
<P>
For the Public Authorities:
</P>
<P>
Representing the Member States of the European Union: Suvi
Linden, minister of Culture of Finland;
</P>
<P>
Representing the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa: Awoture
Eleyae, secretary general, CSSA.
</P>
<P>
The IOC proposes Richard W. Pound to be the first chairman of
the Board. Mr. Pound of Canada is an Olympic athlete, the first
vice-president of the IOC, and the chancellor of McGill University.
</P>
<P>
WADA has also invited intergovernmental organizations to
participate as observers, such as the International Criminal
Police Organization, the United Nations International Drug Control
Program and the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
The board will hold its first meeting later this year or at the
beginning of 2000. Its initial tasks will include the appointment
of its other members, a review and finalization of its mission
statement and policies, the development of the procedure by which
it will designate its permanent location and chief executive, and
the adoption of the agency's budget for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The framework for WADA was developed through a consensus built
among international sporting and intergovernmental organizations.
The principles guiding its establishment include the following:
</P>
<P>
-- WADA activities will be guided by the highest ethical
principles;
</P>
<P>
-- No single organization will be in a position to control WADA;
</P>
<P>
-- The agency will further operate on the basis of equal
representation of the Olympic Movement and the public authorities;
</P>
<P>
-- Athletes are represented in the governance of the WADA,
along with the other participating organizations;
</P>
<P>
-- The approach to the problem of doping in sport will be
international in scope and designed to achieve uniformity both in
the development of the rules and their implementation;
</P>
<P>
--Its activities will include research, as well as education
and prevention.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the Agency fulfills the commitment the
participants of the February World Conference on Doping in Sport
made to the athletes of the world. It marks both the end of hard
work to establish the agency and the beginning of the more complex
work ahead to improve it.
</P>
<P>
WADA will need the continued cooperation of Sport and
Government as it sets out to finalize its mission statement and
working procedures.
</P>
<P>
The agency was incorporated as a foundation governed by the
laws of Switzerland and supervised by the Swiss federal
authorities.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia have apologized for attack of the U.N. office in southern
city of Kandahar by anti-U.S. demonstrators on Wednesday, a U.N.
official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The Kandahar-based U.N. staff are staying in the town after
Taliban authorities tendered apology for yesterday's incident,"
the official said, requesting not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Afghans who were holding an anti-U.S. rally in
Kandahar, the home to Taliban's headquarters, perked the U.N.
office with stones, breaking several windows. However, there was
no injury to the staff members.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were protesting against the upcoming
sanctions on Afghanistan, which will be imposed if the Taliban
fail to hand over the indicted terrorist Osama bin Laden for trial
by October 14, according to a U.N. Security Council resolution
issued last month.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden was charged by the United States of masterminding the
bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa last year. However, the
Taliban have ruled out the extradition of the Saudi dissident to
the United States.

KANAZAWA, Japan, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Atlanta Olympic bronze
medallists Brazil survived a scare against the United States to
stay in contention for one of the three Sydney Olympics berths up
for grab in the 12-team women's World Cup volleyball tournament
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians, who were 5-1 after their previous six matches,
needed 91 minutes to fight off a spirited challenge by the
Americans for a 25-19, 20-25, 25-15, 25-14 victory.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans have made a lot of progress since we played them
last time. They were so strong in the first two sets, but I
believe we played one of our best games of the tournament in the
last two sets," Brazilian coach Bernardo Rezende said.
</P>
<P>
"I had been worried about our poor serves, but today Erika
Coimbra hit a lot of good service winners which gave her
confidence in the match," Rezende added.
</P>
<P>
Brazil now stands third in the standings after favourites Cuba
and Russia, who chalked up a seventh straight win each to remain
unbeaten in the 12-team round robin.
</P>
<P>
Three-time defending champion Cuba beat Argentina 25-14, 25-18,
25-14 in 58 minutes. European champions Russia, titlist in the
World Grand Prix in August, breezed past winless African champions
Tunisia 25-13, 25-18, 25-12.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Canadian PM Plays Down Cancellation of Speech in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien has reacted philosophically to the decision of the
Nigerian government to cancel a planned address to the national
legislature during his just concluded two-day visit to the
country.
</P>
<P>
"I have been making speeches all my life and one less is not
the end of the world," he told reporters after launching Canada's
new high commission in the Nigerian capital Abuja on Wednesday,
the Nigerian News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The address to the joint session of the two-chamber national
assembly, originally scheduled as his second official engagement
on Wednesday, was cancelled late Tuesday after the Nigerian
President Olusegun Obasanjo feared members of the lower house
refused to attend the session to be chaired by the senate
president Evan Enwerem.
</P>
<P>
The 360-member lower house voted last month to boycott joint
sessions chaired by the senate president after a committee of the
house accused him of lying about his age and education.
</P>
<P>
Chretien, whose country was in the forefront of the
international campaign to isolate the Nigerian military regime in
the last 15 years, said he would have "loved to address the
legislature" to convey the feelings of his government for the
restoration of democracy in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Chretien left for Durban, South Africa, on Wednesday afternoon
to attend the biennial meeting of the Commonwealth heads of
government.

<HEADLINE> Cyclone Has Long-Term Effect on India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The cyclone that hit India's
east coast on October 29 would have devastating long-term effect
on the ecology and agricultural patterns of the affected area,
experts warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Robbed of a precious chunk of its forest cover and crop fields
in the coastal districts of Orissa by the cyclone, which has so
far killed 7,626 people, ecological balance in the state had
turned topsy-curvy, threatening its people with a fierce and
rainless summer ahead.
</P>
<P>
The mid-November sun has reportedly become unbearably hot for
3.:2@@4@9-5:53""@% 2xpr2;:/5:445)96@992:42?@
residents of Bhubaneswar, Orissa's capital, 1,745 kilometers
southeast of New Delhi, and other cities.
</P>
<P>
The heat wave in May 1998 took over 2,000 lives in the area
and, this time, the scene could be worse, warned Banka Behari Das,
an eminent environmentalist in the state.
</P>
<P>
The over eight-meter tidal surge that flooded such areas as
Paradip Chandbali and Astaranga along the coast has completely
wiped off prospects of agriculture in the near future.
</P>
<P>
While detailed reports about damage and destruction of houses
from most of the affected districts are yet to come, the Press
Trust of India (PTI) said standing paddy crops over an area of
313,713 hectares were affected while non-paddy crops in 8,668
hectares had been damaged,
</P>
<P>
Even worse, with the erosion of the sea water into the inland
and the missing of plants in the rocky coastal areas, the effect
of the cyclone on environment will take years to recover.
</P>
<P>
Environment expert of the International Red Cross Society
Julian Robert, who is in the cyclone-affected area, told the press
that "there are lessons to be learnt from the devastation."
</P>
<P>
It would no doubt take a long time for things to return to
normal, said Robert.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Wants Thaw in Ties with Israel: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has sent several
positive signals to Israel in the past few days, both publicly
and via quiet channels, indicating its desire to defuse the
recent diplomatic tension between the two countries, a local
daily said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has softened its attitude after Foreign Minister David
Levy expressed dissatisfaction with Cairo over its alleged
resistance to normalization, its efforts to block dialog between
Israel and Arab and Muslim states, and the abusive language it
used toward Israel, Haaretz said.
</P>
<P>
The positive signs Egypt has sent included two declarations
made by Egyptian Defense Minister Mohammed Hussein Tantawi on the
importance of the "strategic peace" with Israel, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Tantawi has also denied a statement, allegedly made by him
late last month in a closed forum, that Egypt should prepare for a
future war with Israel. A diplomatic crisis was sparked after an
Israeli daily Maariv reported on the statement.
</P>
<P>
Levy had lodged protest with Egyptian Ambassador to Israel
Mohammed Bassiouny over the statement. Bassiouny, however, said
later that a thorough inquiry in Egypt had found Tantawi had not
made such a statement.
</P>
<P>
Other signals sent by Egypt, the paper said, included a
declaration by Foreign Minister Amr Mussa that there is no
problem of any kind in Egypt's relations with Israel, and an
announcement by Cairo that it agrees to convene a regional
economic conference unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Egypt has renewed contacts with Israel on supplying
natural gas to Israel. Egyptian Minister of Petroleum Amin Sameh
Samir Fahmi met a few days ago with an Israeli diplomat, Haaretz
quoted sources in the Foreign Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians have made it clear that they are interested in a
quiet dialogue, and in recent weeks have permitted a number of
businessmen to visit Israel to test the waters for possible deals,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Thirty years after Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel,
the first of such kind between Israel and the Arab world, Israel
complains that the two countries are still in a "cold peace."
</P>
<P>
One of the major issues of contention between the two
countries was the renewal of the multilateral talks stipulated by
the Middle East peace conference held in Madrid in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Balking at the resumption of the talks at a state level, Egypt
is proposing instead discussions on regional projects and quiet
talks, through Washington, on arms control.
</P>
<P>
Israel has rejected this idea, insisting that the multilateral
talks be held and in a public way.

of states will attend the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Formation of Macao Garrison Attracts Popular Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The newly-established Garrison
troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) for the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR) has attracted wide attention
from the public as all major Beijing-based newspapers published
stories about the troops on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a Xinhua report carried by these newspapers, Major
General Liu Yuejun, now commander of the Macao garrison troops,
was authorized by the PLA headquarters earlier in the year to form
the Macao Garrison troops in Zhuhai, a coastal city which borders
Macao.
</P>
<P>
The garrison troops will have nearly 1,000 personnel mostly
from infantry troops. There will also be a small number of Navy
and Air Force officers.
</P>
<P>
One motorized infantry and one armored infantry company from
the Hong Kong SAR have been chosen to join the Macao SAR Garrison
troops. The former HK SAR Garrison soldiers were widely applauded
for their meritorious performances in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Garrison troops also include some other newly-formed
troops, including a motorized infantry company once reviewed by
the late Chinese leader Mao Zedong in 1949, an armored infantry
company praised for its merits in engineering projects and anti-
flooding battles, and a safe-keeping and reconnaissance company.
Some its members come from a unit known as "the Sharp Sword of the
South" and others from a unit that was among the first troops
established in the Jinggang Mountain Revolutionary Base area in
the late 1920s.
</P>
<P>
Many of the new troops members are noted for their professional
skills and higher education background.
</P>
<P>
Major General He Xianshu, a former chief of the political
department of the HK SAR Garrison is now the political commissar
of the Macao Garrison.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yaping, head of a safe-keeping and reconnaissance squad,
was chosen as the first sentry on July 1, 1997, when the HK SAR
Garrison took over the barracks from British troops.
</P>
<P>
Major Li Ying, who has a master's degree in English, is the
eighth in the HK SAR Garrison troops to have acquired the rights
to practice law in Hong Kong. He is now spokesman for the Macao
Garrison and also in charge of law and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guofeng, a soldier who has tied sandbags weighing three
kilograms to his legs, is one of the best trained in the garrison.
His best result in a 400-meter obstacle race in one minute and 28
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Of the Macao Garrison officers, 86 percent are university or
college graduates. Most of the garrison soldiers graduated from
high schools. The average height of the men is 1.7 meters and that
of the women, 1.65 meters.
</P>
<P>
As General Liu, the commander, puts it, although the Macao
Garrison troops are small in number, they are responsive, alert
and capable.
</P>
<P>
The city government of Zhuhai has attached great importance to
the building of barracks for the garrison troops. It took merely
203 days for local contractors to complete the barracks, an
project that would usually take three years.

<P>
LAGOS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Some Nigerian Senators Wednesday
 introduced a bill proposing a change of the country's name by
adding the word "democratic", media reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The senators, including Emma Nwaka, B.Y. Bello, T.M. Akpan and
Don-Pedro, said such a move would serve as a warning and deterrent
to persons who want to illegally subvert democracy in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which has been submitted to the National Assembly and
titled "Bill for the Amendment of the Name of Nigeria" wanted the
new name of the west Africa country to read like "Federal
Democratic Republic of Nigeria".
</P>
<P>
The proponents of re-name say that they anticipate maximum
cooperation in passing this bill while "looking forward to
sustainable democracy and good governance in Nigeria".
</P>
<P>
This reflects deep fears for a possible comeback of a military
rule after the soldiers ruled the country 39 years out of its
49-year after- independent history, analysts said.

<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A number of Chinese military
technology research institutes, which have made great
contributions in making China's first atom and hydrogen bombs and
satellite, are focusing on developing environmental protection
technology.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding researchers are using top military technology and
advanced facilities to control pollution and protect the
environment, said Song Baozeng, vice president of the Chinese
Academy of Engineering Physics.
</P>
<P>
During a symposium on employing military technology to protect
the environment, Song said that urban garbage treatment and
utilization technology developed by the academy has received
strong support from the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Garbage treatment technology has done little damage to the
environment. The technology may recycle some garbage as fertilizer
to increase grain yield, said Song.
</P>
<P>
According to Song, the Academy has also developed efficient
sewage treatment and smoke desulfuration technology.
</P>
<P>
During four decades of developing nuclear weapons, the Academy
developed technology for treating radioactive waste water and gas.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhiyuan, deputy secretary general of China Environmental
Science Society, said that China should give priority to improving
and developing environmental protection technology to resolve
pressing environmental issues.

<P>
LAGOS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has been urged by the
U.S. government to participate in the African Crisis Response
Initiative to help African nations enhance their peace-keeping
abilities, The Guardian newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Making Nigeria involved in conflict resolution and
peace-keeping efforts was critical to regional stability, U.S.
Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been involved in peace-keeping efforts in some
African countries during the past 10 years, Pickering said in a
statement released by the U.S. embassy in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
"If we have information, technology and ideas to impart to the
Nigerians, it will put them in the position to work more closely
with other nations" that have already participated in crisis
initiative conceived by the United States, he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States is ready to assist the Nigerian military
achieve its place as a leader in regional and international
peace-keeping efforts, according to the U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
Pickering said that "a strong, democratic and prosperous
Nigeria can help the U.S. government meet its two main policy
objectives in Africa."
</P>
<P>
The first objective is to "integrate the continent into the
global economy through trade, investment, sustainable development
strategies."
</P>
<P>
And the second is to "deal with trans-national threats that
affect both Africans and Americans, including drug trafficking,
trans-national crimes, terrorism, environmental degradation and
disease," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Iran Hopes for Normalizing Relations With Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Thursday expressed hope that the relations between
Iran and Egypt would reach the highest level in the near future.
</P>
<P>
This indicated Iran's eagerness to normalize relations with
Egypt, whom it has been denouncing for signing the Arab nation's
first peace accord with Israel. The two countries now have
interest sections in each other's capital.
</P>
<P>
In remarks to the Islamic Republic News Agency after returning
from a visit to Thailand, Kharrazi said he was satisfied with the
development of the Tehran-Cairo ties, and the two sides have taken
big steps in promoting cooperation in economic fields and
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He called on Cairo "to further distance itself from the Israeli
regime in order to have close ties with Islamic countries,
including Iran."
</P>
<P>
Iran and Egypt severed diplomatic relations soon after the 1979
Islamic revolution, accusing Cairo of betraying Islamic interest
by making peace with the Jewish state..
</P>
<P>
Relations and cooperation between the two countries improved
after the election of Iran's moderate President Mohammad Khatami,
even though the two countries have not resumed full diplomatic
relations.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian officials have asked Iran to remove the hurdle to a
full resumption of ties by changing the name of a main street in
Tehran. The street was named after Khaled Islamboli, the assassin
of former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, who signed the Camp
David accord with Israel, in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi underlined the need for Asian countries to strengthen
their relations and cooperation, saying Asian countries enjoy high
priority in the foreign policies of the Iranian government.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Corp. To Go Long Way Addressing Government's Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. Chairman
Bill Gates said on Wednesday that the software giant was willing
to go "a long way" to address the government's concerns over its
business practices but can not accept limitations on its ability
to develop software, according to reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to more than 2,000 shareholders at the company's
annual meeting, Gates acknowledged the company was disappointed
with U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's 207-page "
findings of fact" issued Friday, which concluded that Microsoft
used its monopoly power to squelch competition.
</P>
<P>
While Gates reiterated the company would prefer to settle the
case out of court if possible, he and other executives repeatedly
said the preliminary ruling was only one step in a long legal
process that appears headed for appeals.
</P>
<P>
"I still believe that the American legal system at the end of
the day will recognize that Microsoft's innovations and behavior
were completely fair and brought tremendous benefits to millions
of consumers," Gates said.
</P>
<P>
"We're willing to go a long way to address the government's
concerns, but if we can't add Internet support, we can't add any
new features," Gates said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "If we can't define the user experience of Windows so
that all Windows machines operate the same way, then the Windows
brand is meaningless."
</P>
<P>
As for the more radical solution of breaking the company into
pieces, Chief Operating Officer Bob Herbold said executives had
seen nothing in Jackson's findings to justify such as drastic
remedy.
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment on settlement talks with the government
that are expected to resume as early as this week in Jackson's
chambers.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Board of Investment Fully Y2K Compliant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The computer systems of the
Board of Investment (BOI) of Thailand have been declared fully
Year 2000 (Y2K) problem compliant, according to a BOI press
release received Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A representative of the BOI received a plague at a ceremony
held here Thursday from consultant experts of Infonet Thailand,
attesting to the compliance of both the hardware and the software
of the BOI's external systems, including the intranet and the
internet.
</P>
<P>
The BOI's internal systems were passed as compliant earlier
this year while the raw material tracking system of its investor
club, a key organization that helps BOI-promoted clubs import raw
materials duty free, was declared compliant in September.
</P>
<P>
Pairot Sompouti, deputy secretary general of BOI, was quoted as
saying that the agency has been very serious about solving all
issues and problems relating to Y2K. He hopes that all the people
who deal with them to have "utmost confidence" in their systems.
</P>
<P>
So far, BOI has spent 3.5 million baht (92,105 U.S. dollars) in
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
A senior executive of Infonet said the BOI can look forward to
the new millennium with full confidence with regard to the Y2K
issue.
</P>
<P>
However, Infonet will ensure that all of the BOI's data are
backed up, and a standby team will be on hand at the New Year to
monitor the changeover.

<P>
ANKARA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- A crisis occurred in the last day of the preparation
meetings for the summit of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) over the rights of minorities in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
According to information obtained from diplomatic sources, the
Foreign Ministry applied to OSCE for the meeting organized by the
Human Rights Association in Washington to be postponed.
</P>
<P>
The demand was turned down by the OSCE. The crisis has subsided
after the United States intervened.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- Captive leader of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) Abdullah
Ocalan, who was sentenced to death and is currently imprisoned on
the Imrali Island, said the recent assassination of a renowned
intellect was committed by those who wanted war, instead of
conciliation.
</P>
<P>
"The desire of (Professor Taner) Kistali to overcome the
atmosphere of violence and to establish a line of conciliation,
and his assassination prior to my appeals case, has something to
do with me," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Ocalan said Kistali had put forward the
idea that the Kurdish problem could only be solved within the
framework of a democratic, peaceful republic. Ocalan declared that
he opposed the assassination of Kistali no matter who committed it.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, founding father of modern Turkey, was
commemorated on the 61st anniversary of his death with ceremonies

President Suleyman Demirel visited Ataturk's mausoleum and laid
a wreath. The president wrote in the book of remembrance that "you
are the most valuable source of light for our nation. We will
continue to walk in your footsteps."

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Meets U.N. Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi and visiting U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan held talks
Thursday to exchange views on a wide-range of issues.
</P>
<P>
During the 30-minute meeting at the Japanese prime minister's
official residence, Obuchi told Annan that Japan will extend
further aid to help East Timor establish independence and will
urge Indonesia to assist that process.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi promised to "actively make further personnel and
financial contributions" now that the U.N.Transitional
Administration will soon be dispatched to East Timor, a Japanese
government official said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived in Japan on Wednesday for a five-day
official visit, said that he "welcomes any kind of Japanese
assistance now that specialized know-how is necessary" for East
Timor, along with humanitarian and rehabilitation assistance, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also reaffirmed the need to address growing
frustration in Japan over its long bid to become a permanent
member of the U.N. Security Council, the official said.
</P>
<P>
There was "growing dissatisfaction in Japan over the situation
in which Japan has been sincerely paying up its increasing U.N.
contributions despite its tight budget and unrealized reform of
the Security Council," Obuchi was quoted as telling Annan.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the U.N. chief also urged Japan to address
such global issues as crisis prevention and development when it
hosts a summit of the Group of Eight nations next July in Okinawa,
the official said.

<HEADLINE> Craze For On-line Literary Journals in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Some influential literary
journals in China are publishing their electronic editions on the
web to attract young web surfers.
</P>
<P>
Any Internet browser can easily find homepages of "Xinhua
Digest", "Writer Digest", "China Writer", "Novel Monthly", "
October", and "Harvest", the most prestigious Chinese literature
periodicals in China.
</P>
<P>
Mengya, or Burgeonings, was among the earliest owners of a
homepage. Early this year, the editorial department established
its own website (www.mengya.online.sh.cn), providing readers with
selected novels and a chat room hosted by Chen Cun, a famous
writer.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Writers' Association also started a website (www.
jrzj.com.cn), through which on-line visitors can read works of
Chinese literary masters such as Lao She, Ba Jin, Xiao Qian and
Ding Ling.
</P>
<P>
Called "Today's Writer", the website has links with other sites
such as "People's Literature" and "October".
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Writers' Association said that the on-line literary
journals will attract many more readers.
</P>
<P>
Literary journals always show new literary trends in China. But
many writers complain that there are few outlets for the works.
</P>
<P>
Mengya's editor-in-chief Zhao Changtian said that being on-line
benefits both readers and the editorial department.
</P>
<P>
A Toronto on-line book store covers some 50 Chinese literary
periodicals at its website: www.dragonsource.com.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican President Says His Role in SADC, SI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano said that it is not contradictory for him to be both
Chairman of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and
Deputy Chairman of the Socialist International (SI) for African
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The two roles are compatible," Chissano said. "As SI Deputy
Chairman, my job is to make Africa and Europe closer. As SADC
Chairman, I can make more contacts with SI members."
</P>
<P>
The president said his election as Deputy Chairman of the
Socialist International was a great honor for the Mozambican
people, the Noticias newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chissano made his first formal reaction to his election when he
was campaigning for the coming presidential election in central
Sofala Province Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican president was elected as SI deputy chairman
during the organization's 21st Congress in Paris last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said that his election as SI deputy chairman was not
unexpected, adding that his government has been cooperating well
with the Socialist International in African and other
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has made great efforts to maintain peace, democracy
and social equity, which has been acknowledged by other SI
members, he noted.
</P>
<P>
One major challenge facing the Socialist International is to
eliminate poverty, Chissano said, pledging to make further efforts
to "make globalization more humane and beneficial to the whole
world."

<P>
Sino-Israeli relations have grown smoothly since the
establishment of diplomatic relations seven years ago. The two
countries have also maintained frequent high-level exchanges of
visits in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Weizman visited China last April following
the then Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to
China in 1998. The Chinese also reciprocated last month when
Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian and Dai Bingguo, head of the
International Department of the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee, visited Israel.

This reciprocity reflects good relations between China and
Israel, the ambassador said, adding that the two countries share

history, and a strong commitment to education.

<HEADLINE> U.S. School Shooter Gets Nearly 112 Years In Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, November 10 (Xinhua) -- An Oregan teenager who
killed his parents and opened fire on his high school classmates,
killing two and wounding several others, was sentenced on
Wednesday to Nearly 112 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Lane County Circuit Judge Jack Mattison delivered his judgment
after hearing final arguments from attorneys for Kip Kinkel, who
was 15 at the time of the shootings and therefore ineligible for
the death penalty. Under Oregon law, the 17-year-old Kinkel could
have been sentenced to as few as 25 years or as many as 220,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
Reports say Kinkel, in September, pleaded guilty and agreed to
serve at least 25 years in prison for the murders, plus whatever
the judge might be added. The judge crafted a combination of
concurrent and consecutive sentences that added up to 111 years
and 8 months.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel's rampage began on May 20, 1998, after he was expelled
from school for having a stolen pistol in his locker. He shot and
killed his parents, teachers Bill and Faith Kinkel, then spent the
night planting booby-trap bombs around their bodies.
</P>
<P>
The next morning, dressed in a long trench coat, he walked into
the cafeteria just before classes began and calmly pulled a.22-
caliber semiautomatic rifle from his coat. Firing from his hip, he
squeezed off 50 rounds in just 90 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Ben Walker, 16, and Mikael Nickolauson, 17, were killed and 25
people were wounded. The shooting ended when several boys tackled
Kinkel as he tried to reload.
</P>
<P>
The shooting spree was one of a string of deadly U.S. school
attacks including a massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo this year that left 15 people dead, including the two gunmen.

<HEADLINE> Nicosia Woman of 56 Has Baby After Cancer Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A 56-year-old Nicosia woman,
who had suffered from breast cancer and recovered, had on Tuesday
given birth after receiving an ovary transplant, the Cyprus Mail
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gavriil Kalakoutis, director of Gynaecological Unit of
Nicosia's Makarios hospital, said that it was a first case for the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
After making a full recovery from the breast cancer, the woman,
who was not named, decided that she would like nothing more than
to have a second child, and began special fertility treatment at
the Makarios hospital.
</P>
<P>
Kalakoutis said the woman had undertaken a very brave act
because former cancer patients who underwent in vitro
fertilization risked the danger of the cancer resurfacing.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, the woman showed a tenacity that overcame the
doctors' misgivings.
</P>
<P>
After undergoing all the necessary tests and treatments, with
the help of a donated ovary because of her age, the woman managed
to get pregnant.
</P>
<P>
There were no complications during the pregnancy, Kalakoutis
said, and the baby, who was born by caesarean section, weighed in
at a healthy 3.4 kilograms. Both mother and child are doing well.
</P>
<P>
The woman and her family have asked not to be named.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: The Commonwealth Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DURBAN, South Africa, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Heads of
government or representatives of the Commonwealth member states
are flying in South Africa to attend the Commonwealth summit
scheduled on November 12-15 in Indian Ocean port of Durban.
</P>
<P>
The biannual summit, according to the principles of the
organization, will be held in private and informal way and operate
not by voting but by consensus. The emphasis is on consultation
and exchange of views for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
This year's summit, with a theme of "People Centered
Development and Challenge of Globalization", will also discuss
issues of poverty eradication and the debt burdens on developing
members.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth government and business leaders have been
urged to find practical ways to close the wealth gap between
developing countries and their richer counterparts.
</P>
<P>
In order to eliminate poverty, political and business leaders
from the 54 Commonwealth states must cooperate to address the
international debt burden and establish a more equitable global
trading system, South African President Thabo Mbeki has said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the four-day meeting, a communique is expected to
be adopted.
</P>
<P>
The old "British Commonwealth" dates back to the 1930s, with
five members namely Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and
South Africa. The member states shared the same head of state.
</P>
<P>
In 1947, India won its independence from the British colonial
rule and decided to have its own head of state. This shook the
very foundation for the old Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka met with the former members in
London in 1949 and adopted London Declaration. They agreed to make
the British King "Head of the Commonwealth" and symbol of their
free association.
</P>
<P>
The 1949 declaration led the way for many new members with
their own heads of state to join the new association, no longer as
colonies but as sovereign partners.
</P>
<P>
However, some members still share the same head of state,
British Queen Elizabeth II who arrived in South Africa Tuesday to
open the summit in Durban.
</P>
<P>
In the past 50 years, the members of the Commonwealth have
increased from five to the present 54, comprising 1.7 billion
people or a quarter of the world population. Even the
Portuguese-speaking Mozambique became a Commonwealth member in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth made considerable efforts in ending the
apartheid in South Africa, promoting cooperation among its member
countries, and provide channels for the South-North dialogs.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth has become one of the important forces in the
world pluralization process.

MANILA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting between
government troops and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels
continued in the southern Philippine island of Mindanao,
Philippine News Agency (PNA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing fighting in the hinterlands of Cotabato in central
Mindanao added 2,000 more evacuees Thursday to Wednesday's record
of 6,000 coming from the surrounding villages, the PNA said.
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Lumang, local military official, said military
operation will go on unless MILF elements leave the village
Liliongan and nearby villages in Carmen of Cotabato province.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is claiming Liliongan as part of their Camp Usman in
the area.
</P>
<P>
A casualty report from the government troops revealed three
soldiers were killed and five others wounded in firefights the
past several days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Al Haj Murad, MILF vice-chairman for military
affairs, warned of an all-out war in Mindanao should government
troops continue to enter their defense lines.
</P>
<P>
He then urged the intervention of the government-MILF peace
panels into the situation stressing that the MILF only opts for
war if they have no other alternative but to defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
Formal peace negotiations between the government and MILF
opened last October 25 in the neighboring province of Maguindanao.

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebels Cut Supply Lines to SADC Allied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Rebels in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) have besieged Southern African
Development Community (SADC) Allied Forces based at the central
town of Ikela and cut major supply lines to this area, media
reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ikela, situated on the Tshaupa River, a tributary of the Congo
River, has been isolated from supply centers at Mbandaka and
Boende on the same river.
</P>
<P>
The isolation was achieved by the rebel take-over of a small
town called Bokungu, situated between Boende and Ikela and all on
the Tshaupa River.
</P>
<P>
"The major supply route was the waterway. But the rebels will
not allow resupply boats and barges to pass through Bokungu," a
Zimbabwean defense spokesman was quoted as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We tried airlifting supplies and each time our aircraft
approach Ikela, they are fired at," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Ikela was raised during the recent Joint Military
Commission meeting in Ugandan capital Kampala and it was decided
to give the SADC Allied Forces passage as provided for under the
Lusaka peace accord.
</P>
<P>
But Rwanda which supports the rebels has objected to the move
and suggested that the SADC Allied Forces evacuate Ikela as it is
a threat to Kisangani, an important town held by the DRC rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka accord called for a troops standstill position
following its signing. All troops were to remain in the areas they
were occupying at the time the cease-fire came into effect.

TEHRAN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi reiterated on Thursday that Iran welcomes efforts by any
third country which has close ties with the United States to
convince Washington to "change its hostile policies toward Tehran."
</P>
<P>

country (the U.S.) to change its policies and conducts toward the

Such efforts are not mediation because Iran has directly asked

However, Kharrazi said there is yet no talks on mediation and

</P>
<P>
Asefi said the move was a repetition of Washington's policies
which indicated the lack of initiative in its policy toward Iran
and a breach of the international trend of free global trade.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has renewed the economic sanctions
in place since 1979, citing the troubled relations between
Washington and Tehran had not been "fully restored."

<HEADLINE> Britain, Zimbabwe Step up Efforts to Resolve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Diplomatic efforts to resolve
major policy differences between Britain and Zimbabwe have been
stepped up, British High Commissioner Peter Longworth said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that there were a number of fundamental issues
on which the two countries differed but both sides were trying
hard to mend the rift.
</P>
<P>
Chief among the points of dispute was the British government's
insistence that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forces
Zimbabwe to specify its defense spending, particularly in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and London's reluctance to
assist Zimbabwe to acquire land for resettlement purposes.
</P>
<P>
"We are having a difficult patch in our relationship," the
British envoy said, adding that "things were moving onto a very
good track" although an army of conspiracy theories keeps on
derailing gains.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent gays' ambush on Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe during a stop-over in London was unfortunate and
regrettable and had extended the rift between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Longworth said British Minister responsible for African
Commonwealth Affairs Peter Hain had met Mugabe and Foreign
Minister Stan Mudenge during their recent stop-over in London.
</P>
<P>
"Although they did not get to a common position on all issues,
the meeting was a success in bridging the gap and making each side
 understand the other's position better," said the British envoy.
</P>
<P>
"One of the rapid ways of going back on track is to work
closely with international monetary institutions, including the
IMF," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF needs to know the real expenditure because it has a
bearing on the budget deficit. The merits and demerits of the war
are not for the IMF," he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Zimbabwe's land reform, the envoy said that his
country was committed to the land reform process as long as it was
done within the existing legal framework.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Grassroots Procuratorates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- China has called on its over
3,000 prefecture and county-level procuratorates to strive for
excellent leadership, staff proficiency, management, performance
and image in efforts to stamp out judicial corruption.
</P>
<P>
According to the Supreme People's Procuratorate, grassroots
prosecution offices employ more than 80 percent of the country's
total prosecutors and handle more than 80 percent of the cases as
well.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of this year, prosecution offices at
prefecture and county levels handled 35,008 persons in 31,239
cases involving corruption, embezzlement and dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
Of all the cases brought to court, 12,010 were regarded as
major cases which involved more than 50,000 yuan each. 1,966 were
important cases with officials at and above the county level
involved.
</P>
<P>
The overall figure of the cases handled from January to
September was consistent with previous years, but the ratio of "
major and important cases" was higher.
</P>
<P>
After reshuffling thousands of county and prefecture level
procuratorates last year, China replaced another 2,156 leading
officials in 1,062 grassroots prosecution offices. Many of the
newly appointed procuratorates are aged around 35, the SPP said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Criticizes Israeli Stance on U.N. Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has underlined that the
U.N. Security Council resolution 242 demands that Israel withdraw
from all the territories it occupied in the 1967 Mideast War, and
urged Israel to obey it.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic-language Al-Ahram daily reported that Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa denounced Israel's position on the
resolution as legally and politically "wrong."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak claimed on Sunday that the
U.N. resolution did not oblige the Jewish state to withdraw from
all Palestinian territory. The stance has dismayed the Arabs and
triggered criticism.
</P>
<P>
Signaling Egypt's first response, Moussa, addressing a seminar
organized by Cairo University Wednesday, said the Israeli
interpretation was wrong "from both legal and political points of
view because the resolution speaks about the results of the 1967
(war) and it does not differentiate between this land and that."
</P>
<P>
"The resolution speaks about not only Israeli withdrawal from
the occupied territories but its security as well. Therefore it
should be taken as a whole," the pro-government newspaper quoted
him as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, Israel captured the West
Bank, Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and parts of Syrian and Egyptian
territories.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, passed five months after the end of the war,
calls for Israeli withdrawal from the Arab land and also for
respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political
independence of every state in the region.
</P>
<P>
Israel returned the occupied Sinai peninsular to Egypt under a
historic peace agreement signed in 1978, the first between the
Jewish state and an Arab neighbor.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Israel began negotiations with the Palestinians to
work out the final status of the West Bank, Gaza and East
Jerusalem. Negotiations with Syria have not taken place since
early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries, especially Syria, have lost confidence in
Israel because of its failure to abide by its pledges, Moussa
said, referring to Israel's repeated delays in implementing
agreements signed with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Wants Overseas Missions Cut to 6 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to close all
missions abroad except six by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The six lucky missions should be those in New York, Washington,
London, Brussels, South Africa and Geneva, the Monitor daily
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the president said that honorary consuls should be
appointed in countries of economic, investment, tourism and
security interests.
</P>
<P>
Museveni urged the foreign ministry to ensure that all
diplomatic staff do examinable courses in computers so that
expenses on secretaries and other support staff do not increase.
The savings could be used to pay off all the debts, he added.
</P>
<P>
The president also advised that the size of missions abroad
should be cut down, with usually one embassy being manned by no
more than three people.
</P>
<P>
He was embarrassed by the recent auctioning of Uganda embassy
property in Tokyo for non-payment of debts.
</P>
<P>
"We have now 26 embassies abroad. Some of them are in shabby
conditions because of economic problems," an official with the
Information Department of the ministry told Xinhua Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Some people say that Uganda cannot afford to run so many
embassies abroad while some others feel that Uganda has enough
money to run all its embassies, only that it is diverted," the
official noted.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Cabinet Okays Political Organizations Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda cabinet has made
concessions on the Political Organizations Bill 1999 and accepted
most amendments proposed by a parliamentary committee.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs Mayanja Nkangi
told Parliament Wednesday that if the bill was to be adopted,
political parties would have more freedom to operate.
</P>
<P>
Nkangi, who moved the Parliament debate, said that the cabinet
had accepted 90 percent of the proposed amendments by the
parliamentary and legal affairs committee chaired by Wandera
Ogalo.
</P>
<P>
Once the bill is passed, Article 269 of the Constitution, which
has been at the center of political controversy, will lapse.
</P>
<P>
The article bars parties from holding delegates conferences and
 rallies, opening branches, sponsoring candidates in elections
and carrying out other activities likely to interfere with the
ruling National Resistance Movement system.
</P>
<P>
The bill was first tabled in the Parliament during the last
session but was withdrawn by the cabinet after the committee
proposed radical amendments to it.
</P>
<P>
The Ogalo-led committee had proposed over 50 amendments to the
32-clause bill.
</P>
<P>
As the referendum on political system of the east African
country draws near, the debate on the bill turns more heated than
ever.
</P>
<P>
Under the Constitution, a referendum will be held in June 2000
to decide on the country's political system.
</P>
<P>
Political parties argue that the Article 269 of the
Constitution is unfair to them and therefore should be abolished.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian PM Puts Forward Development Strategies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen Thursday emphasized four major strategies to speed up the
development of the country in the future.
</P>
<P>
"In order to speed up the development of the country's economy
and improving the people's living standard, the Royal Government
of Cambodia has set up four major strategies for country's
development," the prime minister said in his interview with
visiting Xinhua Press Group headed by Zhang Guoliang, chief editor
of the Hong Kong Branch.
</P>
<P>
"First is to develop agriculture. We should not neglect it
because Cambodia is a traditional agricultural country," he
stressed, "but the priority is to resolve the water and irrigation
in order to bring the farmland under irrigation."
</P>
<P>
"Second, to increase the input of communications and
telecommunication," He added, "Cambodia is now facing a poor
infrastructure and lots of traffic problems. Many ports, airports
and highways lack repair and restoration."
</P>
<P>
"We will seek foreign assistance and loans including private
investment to improve the situation as quick as possible," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"Third, We must strengthen the supply of electricity and
energy. Without electricity, we can do nothing," the prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"And the last is to exploit human resources and enhance
personnel training," he said, stressing that "how can we make full
use of the loan and foreign assistance if we have no qualified
personnel."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said the Royal Government of Cambodia has achieved some
progresses since it was formed last November. "The policies and
measures that we have announced have been transformed into
concrete actions, which begin to bear fruits in all areas," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prime minister said that Cambodia still has many
difficulties and challenges. He also put forward seven concrete
issues in what he called disequilibrium development areas.
</P>
<P>
The disequilibrium areas include the supply and demand, the
national revenue and expenditure, import and export trade, to
maintain currency stable and to control inflation, job
opportunities, the training of human resources, to raise the
salary of civil servants and to improve the hard life of military
and police.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister and Xinhua Press Group held talks on
Cambodia's internal situation and economic development as well as
how to further strengthen the Sino-Cambodian relationship oriented
toward the new century.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM Fears Chechnya May Destabilize Caucasus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem voiced the fear that Russia's military offensives in
Chechnya could spread instability throughout the Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
Local English-language Daily News on Thursday quoted Cem as
saying that "Our policy regarding Chechnya is well known. We
always defend the territorial integrity of Russia, and this issue,
too, should be solved within this context."
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, events in Chechnya cause great concern in
Turkey," he said, "the situation is in danger of spreading to the
Caucasus and sparking regional instability."
</P>
<P>
Last week, Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said his
government considered the Chechnya issue a "domestic matter" of
Russia, adding that Turkey was sensitive to the sufferings of the
Chechen people.
</P>
<P>
Turks of Caucasian origins in major cities around Turkey have
been holding protests against Russian military operations in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Moscow accused extremist Islamic militants of the rebel
Caucasian republic of being responsible for several bomb attacks
on civilian buildings across Russia, killing hundreds.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Chechen civilians have reportedly been killed and
tens of thousands more have fled the republic since Russian troops
launched air and ground attacks on Chechnya weeks ago.

In addition, Zhang said that China's accession to the WTO is

<HEADLINE> Model Worker Says That Falun Gong Cult Should Be Obliterated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kang Longtian, also a deputy to the country's National People's
Congress (NPC), said that it was appropriate and timely that the
NPC Standing Committee had passed the decision on outlawing cults.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong has every feature of a cult, spreading heretic
preachings such as "the doomsday" and "the earth explosion", Kang
told a recent meeting in Taiyuan.
</P>
<P>
"Its founder Li Hongzhi has ulterior motives to sabotage the
government and turn against society," he said, adding that he and
his fellow workers will never be fooled by cults like Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
As a team leader in a mining company, Kang has contributed much
to society. His deeds have won the respect of his co-workers.
</P>
<P>
Workers in Taiyuan have a better idea of Li Hongzhi and his
Falun Gong, vowing that they will fight to the end to obliterate
the cult, Kang said.

JAKARTA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid Thursday left here for the United States where

an eye medical treatment in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
According to the Antara News Agency, Wahid is scheduled to meet
Clinton in Washington on November 11 at 09:30 local time.
</P>
<P>
Wahid has said that he hoped to convince Clinton that
Indonesia's decision to forge closer ties with Asian powers such
as China, India and Japan would not come at the expense of its
relations with the United States and the West.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Clinton, Wahid is also scheduled to meet
with the International Monetary Fund Director Manager Michael
Camdessus before leaving for Salt Lake City, Utah, to have an eye
medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
The president and his entourage will be in Salt Lake City until
November 14 and will fly to Tokyo on the following day.
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, Wahid is expected to meet Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi, Foreign Minister Yohei Koni and Finance Minister Keichi

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Renewed U.S. Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Wednesday night condemned the
renewed U.S. economic sanctions against Iran, Tehran radio
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said the move was a repetition of Washington's former
policies which indicated the lack of initiative in its foreign
policy toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the sanctions have breached the
international trend of free global trade and have already been
proved inefficient in the past.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions have merely deprived American companies of
presence in the Iranian markets and have been to their
disadvantage, he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has recently renewed the economic
sanctions imposed on Iran in 1979 following the takeover of the
U.S. embassy in Tehran by radical students in the heydays of the
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the sanctions were renewed because the troubled
relations between Washington and Tehran had not been "fully
restored."
</P>
<P>
Over the past few months, several senior U.S. officials
extended overtures to Iran for "unconditional dialog" to improve
relations between the two countries, which were severed in 1980.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian officials insisted that the U.S. must take
positive steps to change its hostile policy towards Iran,
otherwise any talks on relations would be "meaningless."

country stance and does not have official relations, nor conduct
official exchanges with Taiwan. Frlec said his country is ready to
promote cooperation with China in a variety of areas.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Opening Trade Sector Gradually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- China will continue opening
its internal trade sector step by step in the years to come, a
senior Chinese economist said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national conference on chain businesses which
opened here on Wednesday, Huang Hai, chief economist of China's
State Administration of Internal Trade, said that China will
continue to expand its trade in accordance with local and
international demands.
</P>
<P>
China is considered one of the world's largest markets.
Official statistics reveal that its total retail sales reached 1.
48 trillion yuan in the first half of this year, up 6.4 percent
from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Since China opened its internal trade sector several years ago,
about 300 overseas-funded retail firms have been set up,
accounting for only 0.1 percent of the country's total retailers.
"This leaves much room for further development of overseas-funded
commercial firms", Huang said.
</P>
<P>
China has issued Regulations on overseas investment in
commercial businesses on a trial basis, allowing overseas
investors to establish joint retail sales outlets in major capital
cities, autonomous regions, and a number of designated cities in
China.
</P>
<P>
Joint retail outlets were previously restricted to eleven
coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
Wholesale business has been opened to overseas investors as
well, though it is still restricted to Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin
and Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Retail and wholesale giants like Wal-Mart and German Metro have
shown great enthusiasm in expanding their business in China.

<P>
SEOUL, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian Prime Minister
Rinchinnyam Amarjargal said here Wednesday that his country can
help mediate between Seoul and Pyongyang, if requested.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Korea Times Wednesday before
he returned home after a three-day visit to South Korea, he said
leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) want
to settle inter-Korean issues through direct dialogue with their
South Korean counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"If South or North Korea requests our help, we are ready to
help," said the Korea Times quoting Amarjargal, who met Chairman
of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly Kim Yong-nam and Prime
Minister Hong Song-nam during his November 4-5 visit to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
However, the Mongolian Prime Minister also said DPRK leaders
voiced their displeasure with the stationing of U.S. troops in
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian leader stressed that Seoul and Pyongyang are
direct parties and should launch efforts to improve their
relations.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
Wednesday, Amarjargal said, "As the North opened Internet
homepages recently, the communist country will likely reform and
open itself in the near future."

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed lower in
Tokyo Thursday, dragged down by profit-taking after the key Nikkei
index hit its intraday high for the year.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 240.59 points, or 1.30
percent, from Wednesday's close to end at 18,327.28 after moving
between 18,310.26 and 18,659.55, the highest point for the year on
an intraday basis.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index, covering all First
Section issues, dropped 11.41 points or 0.72 percent to 1,582.52.
</P>
<P>
The key index gained ground in the early morning session,
following the Japanese government's unveiling of an 18 trillion
yen (172.2 billion dollars) economic stimulus package.
</P>
<P>
But profit-taking took place following the early gains, leading
share prices lower, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section increased to 839.51 million
shares from 703.31 million shares Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Marubeni, a major Japanese trading firm, was the day's most
heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Traders said investors have recently narrowed their focus to
specific issues, such as information and telecom-related issues,
and that a polarization in the stock market dampened market
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Share prices were lower in 28 of the 33 business sectors.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers far exceeded
gainers 1,073 to 212, with 64 issues closing unchanged.

<HEADLINE> China Ready to Move 700,000 People out of Yangtze River Flood Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Another 700,000 people will be
moved out of flood areas along China's longest river, the Yangtze,
from this winter through next spring, according to sources with
the Yangtze River Water Resources Committee (YWRC).
</P>
<P>
Officials with YWRC said that the central government has
allocated two billion yuan (about 2.4 million U.S. dollars) for
the relocation project during the period.
</P>
<P>
Last year's unprecedented flooding of the mighty Yangtze, which
caused heavy casualties and economic losses, has strengthened the
government's resolve to harness the river, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
By moving a total of two million people out of the flood
diversion zones permanently, the river's flood discharge capacity
should be increased by 10 billion cubic meters in three to five
years.
</P>
<P>
By the time the project is completed, the increased discharge
margin will be equal to half the water-retaining capacity of the
Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest hydroelectric project being
built on the Yangtze's middle reaches.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the 700,000 people from 130,000
families will be resettled away from the lowland area during this
stage of the project. Each household will receive a 17,000 yuan (2,
050 U.S. dollars) government subsidy mainly for building a new
home.
</P>
<P>
After last year's devastating flooding, the Chinese government
has already appropriated 3.49 billion yuan for relocating more
than 900,000 people in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and Anhui provinces
along the middle and lower reaches of the river in preparation for
this year's flood season.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jiyao, vice-minister of water resources, announced
Tuesday that the relocation project already helped increase the
flood discharge capacity by 2.3 billion cubic meters before the
flood came this summer. The summer flooding this year was
considered the country's second worst after last year's.
</P>
<P>
In Hunan Province alone, the capacity has been increased by 650
million cubic meters, or 10 percent, which has shielded 100,000
people from the floodwaters and reduced economic losses by 500
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Li Antian, director of YWRC, told Xinhua that less manpower was
mobilized to safeguard and reinforce the river embankment this
year because of the increased river retaining capacity.
</P>
<P>
"Only 2.5 million people were drafted in during the Yangtze
flood this year, compared to 9.7 million people last year and five
million in a normal year," Li said.
</P>
<P>
YWRC's report for this summer's flooding shows 34.4 billion
yuan (4.1 billion U.S. dollars) of economic losses and 2.2 million
hectares of affected farmland. Last year's flood-stricken farmland,
however, covered 6.5 million hectares and the losses ran up to 134.
5 billion yuan (16 billion U.S. dollars).

have seen many success stories amongst them.
</P>
<P>
"If I were to draw a parallel with the Ann Koai, I would say
that the Malaysian people displayed the same fighting spirit,
discipline, determination and diligence to achieve the goal we set
for ourselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Malaysia's future generations to uphold the principles
of compromise, moderation, integrity and power-sharing to ensure
the country's continued progress.
</P>
<P>
It was unity of the Malaysian people that had helped the
country face and overcome the economic crisis in its own way, he
said, adding "Our strength is in our unity and our unity holds up
against the odds."
</P>
<P>
The convention will hold special workshops for the participants
to share their experiences and forge closer friendship through

<HEADLINE> U.S. Compaq Corp. Unveils 499-Dollar Computer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Personal computer maker
Compaq Computer Corp on Wednesday unveiled a 499-dollar computer
with Internet access that fits at the side of an office desk,
according to reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
The 499-dollar model, which costs about one-third less than
Compaq's previous least expensive business computer, includes a CD-
ROM or DVD drive and sports a 500 megahertz Celeron processor, 64
megabytes of memory and a 4.3 gigabyte hard drive. It doesn't have
a floppy disk drive. A monitor is extra.
</P>
<P>
"We are offering a simpler computer with great design that
takes a lot of complexity out of the personal computer," said
Michael Capellas, Compaq's recently named chief executive.
</P>
<P>
The new computer will come in four configurations. Variation
will depend on whether the user requires a standard 500 megahertz
Intel Celeron chip or a faster Pentium III chip and whether the
device is to be hooked up to modern peripheral equipment like
printers or older equipment requiring different attachments.
</P>
<P>
Prices start at 499 dollars but officials gave no indication of
prices for other configurations.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say PC makers are gearing up to offer a new range of
Internet-ready machines to coincide with the release of Microsoft
Corp.'s next-generation Windows 2000 software in February.
</P>
<P>
They also say the low-priced machine unveiled by Compaq will
only inflame the already intense price wars that have hammered PC
makers during the past year.

<HEADLINE> Religious Freedom Guaranteed in China, Chinese Ambassador Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
tried to protect freedom of belief while standing firm against
such an evil cult as Falungong, Chinese ambassador to the United
States Li Zhaoxing said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhaoxing, in an exclusive interview with "Pat" Robertson,
founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network, Inc. (CBN) in
Virginia Beach, stressed that China's constitution provides for
religious freedom for all citizens.
</P>
<P>
"China now has the largest religious community in the world
with more than 100 million followers of a variety of religions
such as Taoism, Buddhism, Christianity and so on and so forth," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
Talking of Falungong, which has been banned in China, the
ambassador emphasized that it is not a religion, "it is nothing
but an evil cult."
</P>
<P>
The anti-cult laws, just approved by the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress, is by no means directed against
any lawful religious activities, and the Chinese government will
abide by the constitution and relevant laws to guarantee the
freedom of belief, he said.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese government will outlaw all perverse activities
of any evil cult, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li said that he agrees with Pat Robertson that Li Hongzhi,
founder of Falungong, "is actually lying to the people" when he
deliberately changed his birthday to pretend he's the incarnation
of Buddha.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi even boasts that he is "far greater and more
elevated" than Jesus Christ, Buddha and Laozi, founder of Taoism,
the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Li Hongzhi also enticed people who want to enjoy
good health and physical fitness to follow him blindly and keep
away from all medicines.
</P>
<P>
"So far more than 1400 people have died from practicing the
evil cult," Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador told Xinhua that the overwhelming
majority of Falungong followers are innocent and they should be
strictly separated from Li Hongzhi and other evil cult leaders who
will be dealt with according to the Chinese Constitution and
relevant laws.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Internet rising
popularity has cut the number of letters people are sending and
contributed to a one-fifth drop in New Zealand Post's profits.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned postal service Thursday unveiled a tax-paid
profit of 11.7 million NZ dollars (six million U.S. dollars) for
the second and third quarters of this year, 18.8 percent lower
than for the corresponding two quarters of last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of letters sent dropped partly because of a switch
from mail to e-mail, NZ Post said in a media release.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Internet usage has risen dramatically
in the country, with half of New Zealanders now claiming access to
the Internet, up from less than a fifth three years ago.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Capital Welcomed in SOE Reform in SW China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing municipality has
drafted policies to encourage foreign capital in the reform of
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the coming two years, according
to the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
Having a large number of SOEs, Chongqing, in southwest China,
will make use of some domestic and mostly overseas financing to
restructure or annex some 25 unprofitable Chinese enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 52 SOEs in severe financial difficulty will
declare bankruptcy, a government spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Domestic and overseas corporations which take part in the SOE
reform will enjoy preferential policies such as suspension of the
repayment of debt and interest to the government. These companies
also will be freed from the burden of sponsoring schools,
hospitals and other social welfare organizations as SOEs were
asked to in the past.
</P>
<P>
The local government will also give its maximum support to
these overseas companies, and detailed policies on encouraging
competent enterprises to restructure troubled SOEs will soon take
effect, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing is the largest old industrial base in western China,
but quite a number of its enterprises are experiencing management
dilemmas. The losses incurred by its large and medium-sized
enterprises were 20 percent higher than the nation's average in
1998.

WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Los Angeles Lakers coach
Phil Jackson and Jerry Stackhouse of the Detroit Pistons each were
fined US$5,000 by the NBA on Wednesday for their actions in the
games last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Jackson was fined for critical post-game comments after
Saturday's 97-82 loss to Portland. The Lakers coach tore into the
officials after they ejected Shaquille O'Neal with a second
technical four with 9:40 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
"I was really disappointed in the referees tonight," Jackson
said. "I thought they were awful out there letting Shaq be
attacked like that and they made him the villain for that
situation when these guys were jumping on his back."
</P>
<P>
Stackhouse was fined for throwing the ball at official Dee
Kantner during Saturday's game at Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
Late in the fourth quarter, Stackhouse became entangled with
Sam Cassell and fell out of bounds. When Kantner gave possession
to Milwaukee, Stackhouse threw the ball at her and was ejected.

<HEADLINE> Wheat, Corn, Soybeans Tumble on Chicago Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Wheat, corn and soybean
prices tumbled on Wednesday at the Chicago Board of Trade as the
market reacted to the latest U.S. Agriculture Department crop
report, according to reports reaching here late in the day.
</P>
<P>
In its November production and supply and demand reports
released before the market opened, the department raised its
estimate for U.S. wheat stocks for the 1999/2000 marketing year
that ends May 31, 2000, to a 12-year high of 1.002 billion bushels.
</P>
<P>
The figure was higher than the its October estimate of 987
million. The agency also cut its projection of U.S. wheat exports
for 1999 to 1.1 billion bushels from 1.125 billion.
</P>
<P>
The worldwide wheat production was also on the rise, with
output in Australia, Argentina and Canada forecast to be increased
by at least 500,000 tons each. Total global wheat production was
seen at 584.68 million tons, up from the department's October
estimate of 577.73 million, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The United States would produce the third-largest corn crop on
record at 9.537 billion bushels in the 1999/2000 year ending Aug.
31, up from the October forecast of 9.467 billion. While the
agency trimmed its forecast for soybean production this year, it
raised estimated stock levels and shaved export estimates.
</P>
<P>
Soybean production was forecast at 2.67 billion bushels, down 1
percent from last month. But the stockpile of soybeans was
increased by 10 million bushels to 395 million bushels.
</P>
<P>
At the Chicago Board of Trade, December delivery wheat settled
5.5 cents lower at 2.48 dollars per bushel, a new low for that
contract, while December corn ended 5.5 cents lower at 1.9525
dollars while January delivery soybeans were off 13 cents at 4.66
dollars, its lowest close since August 13.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Undecided on Missile Choice For Defense Program: Defense Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korea denied Thursday that
it had decided to buy U.S.-made Patriot missiles for its new air-
defense program.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Defense Ministry said it has not yet decided
to buy any country's missiles for their defense program, which is
code-named SAM-X.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the U.S. Patriot missile, Russia and France are
also competing in the program.
</P>
<P>
"It is untrue that we have asked for or decided to purchase the
U.S.-made missiles," said a Defense Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In September, the Defense Ministry invited missile makers from
the United States, Russia and French to demonstrate their products.
</P>
<P>
It will take more than one year to finish testing and
evaluating the competing missiles, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon Wednesday announced that it had agreed to sell 14
of the latest Patriot air defense systems valued at 4.2 billion U.
S. dollars to South Korea to enhance its air defense capability.
</P>
<P>
"The proposed sale will enhance the Republic of Korea's
defensive capability against hostile neighbors, lessening the
burden on the United States," said the Pentagon in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which is subject to review by U.S. Congress,

<P>
JAKARTA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 1.5 tons of marijuana
were seized by Jakarta police detectives in a single raid on
Wednesday, the Jakarta Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The marijuana, hidden in 12 sealed oil drums, worth about 3
billion rupiah (430,000 U.S. dollars), the report said.
</P>
<P>
City Police chief of detectives Col. Alex Bambang Riatmodjo
said four Achenese had organized delivery of the marijuana-filled
oil drums into the capital from Medan, capital of North Sumatera
province.
</P>
<P>
Police said the operation was the biggest ganja haul for the
past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Other ganja-related arrests occurred on Tuesday night when
police raided a house in East Jakarta, and confiscated 4.3
kilograms of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
On October 6, police detectives in North Jakarta seized 929
kilograms of marijuana, worth about 1.85 billion rupiah, from four
of seven suspected drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
In late September, city police seized 602 kilograms of
marijuana, worth about 1.2 billion rupiah, from four of five
suspected drug dealers in a single raid.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Bid for Renewal of EU Trade Privileges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will make a new bid
to persuade the European Commission (EC) to restore full
preferential tariffs on the kingdom's agricultural products, the
Bangkok Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A delegation headed by Apinan Pavanarit, director of European
Affairs Department of the Thai Foreign Ministry, will travel to
Brussels next week to discuss trade issues with the EC's director
for relations with South and Southeast Asia, Emilino Fossati.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this year, the European Union (EU) reduced
tariff concessions on three groups of Thai exports, namely fishery
products, fruit and vegetables, and seasoning and ingredients.
</P>
<P>
As a result, fishery exports of the country to the EU in the
first five months of this year dropped 46.2 percent from the same
period last year to 73.46 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, Michel Caillouet, head of the EC delegation to
Thailand, said that 70 percent of Thai exports still enjoyed
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) privileges.
</P>
<P>
In addition to trade tariffs, the Thai delegation will ask for
an update on the EU's policies on the production and labelling of
genetically modified (GM) food.
</P>
<P>
Caillouet said the EU Council of Ministers would decide in a
couple of months what kind of products should be labeled as having
GM content.

<HEADLINE> Bad Loans Auctioned for One-Third Face Value in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Financial Sector
Restructuring Authority (FRA) of Thailand sold commercial loans
worth 17.79 billion baht (468 million U.S. dollars) for 5.3
billion baht (139 million dollars), the Bangkok Post reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The auction on Wednesday was one of the last ones scheduled for
former assets of the 56 finance companies closed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The FRA said eight groups submitted bids for the asset sale.
Sales contract with the winning bidders will be signed on November
30, with final payment due on December 15.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned Asset Management Corporation won four asset
lots for 1.6 billion baht (42 million dollars), or 19.76 of the
outstanding principal balance.
</P>
<P>
One lot was withdrawn from the auction, as the bid submitted
was considered too low.
</P>
<P>
FRA Chairman Amaret Sila-on expressed satisfaction with the bid
results.
</P>
<P>
"In this auction, bid prices of three tranches were over 50
percent of the outstanding principal balance, with the highest bid
price at 52.33 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>

MANILA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ninoy Aquino International

millennium bug, Philippine News Agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Karim Bangcola, executive director of the Presidential
Commission on Year 2000 Compliance, was quoted as saying that only
the NAIA's flight information board needs upgrading so it can be
ready once the bug strikes.
</P>
<P>
Bangcola said the flight information board is the only one left
but NAIA officials said this will be completed soon.
</P>
<P>
Bangcola also said the Commission plans to double check the
readiness of the NAIA by inviting representatives of the
International Air Transportation Association (IATA) to inspect the
airport.
</P>
<P>
The IATA is the international organization tasked to rate
airports and their facilities.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure when IATA representatives come over to inspect the
IATA airport, the airport and its facilities will be ready,"
Bangcola said.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug is a built-in flaw in older computer systems
that prevent them from correctly reading dates from January 1,

HOHHOT, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Inner Mongolian Autonomous
Region, the first autonomous region set up in China, has called on
junior middle schools to offer foreign languages courses.
</P>
<P>
In addition, local officials in charge of education should
enroll more primary school students and spare no effort in
developing programs for vocational ethnic education and ethnic
higher education, said Boyin Delger, vice-chairman of the Inner
Mongolian Autonomous Region, at an autonomous regional meeting on
education here today.
</P>
<P>
The vice-chairman, who is in charge of education for the people
of various ethnic groups, urged that priority be placed on
education in ethnic regions so as to upgrade the overall quality
of students there.
</P>
<P>
"The government of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region has
always insisted on the principle of giving preference to ethnic
education," Boyin Delger said.
</P>
<P>
The reform of ethnic education has resulted in improved
education quality and the rapid growth of vocational ethnic
education, and there are more job options available for ethnic
students, who have been educated in Mongolian language.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics available, the number of students with
ethnic minority backgrounds in various types of schools in Inner
Mongolia has reached 898,900, of which 765,100 are Mongolian.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Ponders Bid to Host 2004 Asian Soccer Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Football
Federation (PSSI) is still pondering its plan to bid to host the
2004 Asian Cup, according to general secretary Tri Goestoro.
</P>
<P>
Tri said a factor needed to be considered before deciding to
bid is the existence of the stadiums, which -- except for the
Senayan Stadium in Jakarta -- are far from able to meet
international standards.
</P>
<P>
"Under AFC (the Asian Football Confederation) rules, the host
country must have three or four stadiums of international standard,
"Tri was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"To date, Senayan may be the only site ready for the event," he
said, adding that the PSSI received a letter from AFC over the bid
invitation for the 2004 Asian Cup.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is the only AFC member to declare its intention to bid
for the four-yearly Asian soccer event.
</P>
<P>
The decision to grant the hosting right will be taken at the
confederation's meeting in Beirut, Lebanon, in November 2000,
which will coincide with the upcoming edition of the event.
</P>
<P>
The qualifying matches for the 2000 Asian Cup are underway to
pick 12 teams to go to Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Tri said the 2004 Asian Cup should be a good opportunity for
Indonesia carry out a campaign to host the campaign given the
preceding two were held in the West Asia region, and one was held
in the United Arab Emirates in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Countries from either Southeast or East Asia will now claim
their turn.
</P>
<P>
"But I have to talk over the issue with chairman and other PSSI
officials," he said.

<P>
CANBERRA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Bowing to the growing
pressure, Australian prime minister John Howard asked the Governor-
General Willian Deane to open the ceremony of the Sydney Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
It was announced in a statement released early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said in the statement he has taken the decision in the
interests of "a great unifying national occasion".
</P>
<P>
Olympic Games are opened usually by head of state of a
directing country.
</P>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state of Australia and while
a Governor-General performs her duty as her representative.
</P>
<P>
John Howard had earlier insisted it was he, not the Governor-
General, would open the 2000 Games.
</P>
<P>
As a monarchist, John Howard voted against a republic proposal
in the last weekend's referendum in which the proposal was
rejected. Since then, the prime minister faced a mounting pressure
from both republicans and monarchists demanding him to step back
from his early stance.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he would inform the Queen of his views on the
matter during an audience with her in South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Japan Unveils Huge Economic Pump-Priming Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government on
Thursday unveiled a long-awaited economic stimulus package worth
some 18 trillion yen (172.2 billion U.S. dollars) aimed at
reviving the Japanese economy by the latter half of fiscal 2000
and delivering a self-sustaining recovery in fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
The package, Japan's ninth since the burst of the asset-
inflated "bubble" economy in the early 1990s, contains 8-9
trillion yen (76.6 to 86.1 billion dollars) in actual spending,
government officials said.
</P>
<P>
The scale of the package has grown from the more than 10
trillion yen (95.7 billion dollars) target originally set by
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi due to the expanded credit-
guarantee scheme for small and medium-sized firms and a government
decision to bring forward the cost of paying for a new nursing
care scheme for the elderly, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government is scheduled to submit to the current
extraordinary Diet (parliament) session a second auxiliary budget
for fiscal 1999 that will finance the core part of the package.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the package attaches great importance to
assistance to small and medium-sized companies through the
addition of 10 trillion yen (95.7 billion dollars) to a special 20
trillion yen (191.4 billion dollars) credit-guarantee scheme for
small and start-up companies.
</P>
<P>
The package also includes measures to help build a super high-
speed telecommunications network to make the Internet available at
all of Japan's public elementary, junior high and senior high
schools by fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it targets the launch of "E-governing," in which
applications to the country's central and local government offices
will be processed online.
</P>
<P>
As for traditional public works projects, the package features
measures to expand Shinkansen bullet train networks, upgrade
international airports and improve urban infrastructure to resolve
traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Japan's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) Taichi Sakaiya,
in releasing the details of the package at a press conference,
said he expects the package to boost the country's gross domestic
product (GDP) growth by more than 2.5 percentage points over the
next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
He also said the package's social infrastructure-related
portion, worth some 6.8 trillion yen (65.1 billion dollars), will
add a real 1.6 points to the GDP growth over the same period.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of recent economic trends and the stimulus package
's expected impact, the EPA revised upward the same day its
projected growth for the Japanese economy in fiscal 1999, which
ends March 31 next year, to 0.6 percent from 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Residents In Harmony With Wildlife In Central China Nature Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like many of his fellow residents in the Shennongjia Nature
Reserve in central China, Mao has joined in the drive started by
local communities in the 1990s to save wildlife from the threat of
man.
</P>
<P>
To give the animals more space in their natural habitat, more
than 5,000 villagers have voluntarily moved out of the reserve and
resettled outside the mountains.
</P>
<P>
Xie Dengfeng, a local government official, said that villagers
participating in the community's efforts to protect wildlife have
alleviated the conflicts between man and nature, and the
relocation will help preserve the nature reserve, home to 70 kinds
of animals under State protection.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, the residents in Shennongjia Nature Reserve
existed on hunting, herb collecting and logging, activities which
were pushing the wild animals to near extinction.
</P>
<P>
In 1986 when Shennongjia Nature Reserve was set up, hunting,
tree cutting and herb collecting were banned in a zone of 70,000
ha, permanently changing the fate of the wildlife there.
</P>
<P>
But illegal hunting occasionally occurred. In 1987, several
peasants were imprisoned for selling 22 golden monkeys.
</P>
<P>
As the number and varieties of wild animals increased, they ate
more and more livestock and crops, which created hardship for the
farmers. Villagers fought back by building fences, setting up
scarecrows, and beating gongs to frighten off the beasts, but
about 40 percent of their crops were spoiled.
</P>
<P>
"Wild animals should be protected, and we can no longer make a
living here," said a worried villager.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, more and more residents have decided on
their own to move outside the reserve.
</P>
<P>
"In a period of 20 years, there have been fundamental changes
in villagers' attitudes toward the wild animals: they gave up
hunting to protect wild animals, and people are now making way for
beasts in all regards," said Hu Hongxing, an ecologist at Wuhan
University.

<HEADLINE> 3 New Ministers Assume Office in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Three new Sri Lankan ministers
have assumed office in past two days amid the run-up to the
presidential election slated for December 21, political sources
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of these ministers would help the incumbent
Chandrika Kumaratunga of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)
realize her hope of reelection, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Member of Parliament (MP) Arumugam Thondaman, 36, was sworn in
Wednesday as minister of livestock development and estate
infrastructure, succeeding his grandfather S. Thondaman who died
on October 30 at the age of 86.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, two MPs Sarath Amunugama and Nanda Mathews from the
main opposition United National Party (UNP) were appointed
ministers on special assignment.
</P>
<P>
The two MPs along with 33 other UNP members last Friday crossed
over to the government and endorsed their support to ensure
Kumaratunga's victory at the forthcoming election.
</P>
<P>
Arumugam Thondaman is also tipped to succeed his grandfather as
head of the 800,000-strong Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) of
plantation workers of Indian origin.
</P>
<P>
He said his party would "extend its support for the candidature
of the president" in the upcoming election.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Opposition Leader Pledges Talks With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's main opposition
United National Party (UNP) leader Ranil Wickremasinghe Wednesday
said he would start talks with the Tamil rebels in an effort to
end the ethnic war if he won next month's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The UNP leader told the local media Wednesday night that if he
won the elections, he would start talks with the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) without delay.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks with the LTTE would be completed as quickly
as possible, but there would be no deadline, a direct
contradiction of the present government's stance that talks must
be completed within a specified period.
</P>
<P>
He said the administration of the provincial councils in the
north and east of the country would be handed over to the LTTE as
a temporary measure for an interim period of two years pending
elections there.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting an ethnic war against the government
since 1983 for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Wickremesinghe, a former prime minister, is President Chandrika
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga's main rival in the December 21 presidential
elections.

<HEADLINE> Tiny European States Hope to Keep Identity: Andorran President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Andorran Executive
Council President Marc Forne said here Wednesday that it's not
imperative for tiny European countries, such as Monaco, Andorra
and Liechtenstein, to seek membership in the European Union (EU)
since the EU's structure is not suitable for them.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Forne said these tiny European
states have "their own status in the European history" and are
characterized with age-old traditions in many areas.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to find a way so that such tiny countries can keep
their own identity," Forne said.
</P>
<P>
Forne, who arrived here Tuesday for a two-day first ever visit
to Finland by an Andorran premier, said the euro will become
Andorra's currency although the country is not a EU member.
Finland holds the current rotating EU chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, Forne held talks with Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari and discussed the EU's enlargement and bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Forne will meet with Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen and
Parliamentary Speaker Riita Uosukainen on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Latin American Unemployment Reaches 9.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Latin
America has reached 9.1 percent, affecting 18 million people, said
Jean Maninat Machado, International Labor Organization
representative here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Financial crisis in the world increased unemployment and
stimulated the development of an informal economy in the region,
said Maninat at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment has plagued the competition between local products
and products imported from Asia, thereby affecting production in
the region, she added.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and Panama have reduced unemployment, while Brazil has
kept the situation stable. On the other hand, unemployment has
been increased in Colombia and Venezuela slightly, and so has
Chile, though to a lesser extent. However, in Argentina,
unemployment continues to be a "chronic problem", she said.

HAVANA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- President of the Dominican
Republic Leonel Fernandez will make an official visit to Cuba on
November 14-16.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first visit from a Dominican head of state to
the island in the last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Dominican Ambassador to Cuba, Daniel Guerrerro, said Wednesday
that President Fernandez would arrive here heading an important
delegation made up of ministers, high-ranking officials and

</P>
<P>
The two countries are expected to sign a series of cooperation
agreements covering the economy, trade and other sectors.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Population Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's birthrate dipped to 8.3
per thousand in 1998, one of the lowest in the world, according to
official data released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The data showed that some 420,000 babies were born in Ukraine
last year, 23,000 less than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Recent estimates put the country's total population at 49.7
million, about 2.8 million less than in 1990 before the country's
independence.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the country's population has been declining in
recent years due to a higher death rate. In 1998, the death rate
doubled the birth rate.
</P>
<P>
The increase in deaths was partly attributed to growing
incidence of blood diseases and urogenital system diseases as a
result of the deteriorating environment in the country.
</P>
<P>
In addition, life expectancy has declined to 66 years from 70
years in 1990 while the aged group accounts for one third of the
total population.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Economy on Track Toward Recovery: Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's crisis-hit economy
is on track toward recovery, according to the latest survey on
domestic business conditions conducted by Bank Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The survey said domestic business activity continued to improve
during the third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Business would be even brisker in the fourth quarter of this
year on greater expectations of higher demand, favorable weather
and natural conditions and a momentum of further recovery in the
financial sector, the survey was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia surveyed 191 "principal enterprises" in the
third quarter of this year. The survey, which was started in 1993,
is aimed at having a better design of monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's business sector plunged to its worst condition in
three decades last year when the economy contracted by more than
13 percent as the economic crisis that started in the middle of
1997 worsened.
</P>
<P>
Many companies closed down, and some had to operate far below
their production capacity.
</P>
<P>
The survey said signs of improvement in business activity first
emerged in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Further improvement of business activity in the third quarter
was particularly driven by higher consumer purchasing power, as
reflected in higher market demand.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia said that out of eight business sectors
surveyed, five sectors -- the trade, hotel and restaurant sector
and the service, industrial, transportation and mining sectors --
saw improvement in business volume.
</P>
<P>
But business volume shrank in the agriculture, financial and
construction sectors, it said.
</P>
<P>
The survey said 35.1 percent of respondents, primarily in the
agriculture and industrial sectors, made new investments during
the third quarter, particularly in new machinery and equipment,
and they planned to do so in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
The survey said export volume in the third quarter declined due
to lower international demand, particularly in the agriculture
sector.
</P>
<P>
But it anticipated increasing export activity in the fourth
quarter, particularly in the industrial and mining sectors, driven
by expectations of higher international demand.
</P>
<P>
It said continuing improvement in business expectation
coincided with positive development in the country's macroeconomic
picture.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in January-October was 0.08 percent compared
to 75 percent for the same period last year, Bank Indonesia's
benchmark interest rate was now at about 13 percent compared to 70
percent, and the exchange rate of the rupiah has stabilized at
about 7,000 rupiah per U.S. dollar compared to more than 17,000
rupiah.
</P>
<P>
It forecast inflation in 1999 to be at about 2 percent, GDP at
between minus 1 and zero percent, and Bank Indonesia's benchmark
interest rate at between 10 percent and 12 percent by year's end.
</P>
<P>
With a more stable political situation following the election
of the country's new government in October, and improving
relations with the international donor community, the
macroeconomic picture would further improve throughout the rest of
the year, it added.

<HEADLINE> Global Study Finds U.S. Executives Lagging in Entrepreneurship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A global study has found
that the percentage of U.S. executives who opt for self-employment
is much lower than their counterparts in other countries.
</P>
<P>
For a country built on small business start-ups, only eight
percent of U.S. executives choose to be self-employed, compared to
21 percent in Britain and Australia, 23 percent in Canada, and 12
percent on the average worldwide, according to a study released
Wednesday by Drake Beam Morin (DBM), a U.S. outplacement and
career transition firm.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to popular belief, job loss can be a positive
experience for executives, according to the study. In the U.S.,
transitioning executives realized a six percent pay rise on
average with new jobs, and 59 percent of executives worldwide
secured higher paying positions.
</P>
<P>
Respondents of the DBM survey included more than 6,000
transitioning U.S. executives and over 10,000 executives from 26
other countries in Latin America, Europe, South Africa, the Middle
East and the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The study found that 84 percent of transitioning executives
worldwide secured jobs in new organizations, likely aided, to some
degree, by tight labor markets in a number of countries and
industries. The median job search time is a little over four
months and 59 percent are receiving higher compensation in their
new positions.
</P>
<P>
In the U.S., 87 percent of candidates found a new job within
six months, with their positions paying six percent more than
their previous jobs, up to 85,000 U.S. dollars from 80,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Transitioning executives in the Asia-Pacific region secured new
jobs faster (3.8 months) than all the regions surveyed, which DBM
said is somewhat surprising given the difficult economic
conditions and less buoyant employment market.
</P>
<P>
Forty-four percent of those surveyed worldwide found work
through networking. In the U.S., 62 percent secured new positions
through networking, but only 20 percent in Japan found a new
position from this tactic.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen percent of those surveyed found jobs through
advertisements, and 15 percent through agencies and search firms.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, upheavals in the financial services
and chemicals allied products sectors appeared to send more
executives out into the job market. While the data suggest that
many of these executives found positions in the same industry,
some secured opportunities elsewhere, notably the service,
computer, high-technology and consulting industries.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Economy Grows Slightly in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's gross domestic product
(GDP) edged up 0.3 percent in the third quarter of the year
compared with the same period in 1998, Minister of Economy Vasily
Rogovoy told a government meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the slight growth was the first since the Asian
financial crisis erupted in the summer of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the measures adopted by the government
to improve the economy and the international loans have helped to
ease the economic crunch.
</P>
<P>
Rogovoy said that during the first 10 months of the year,
industrial output rose 3.1 percent over the same months last year,
and the third quarter alone registered an increase of 9.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Output of all sectors, including aviation, machinery,
metallurgy and instruments, grew in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Production of light industry and food posted steady growth in
the period, with domestically-made food products now occupying 90
percent of the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the revenue of national budget rose in
the quarter while both the wages and pensions in arrears went down
by 45 percent compared with the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation in Ukraine stood at 11.3 percent in the first 10
months, according to statistics released recently by the National
Statistic Bureau. The figure for the whole year was expected to
be 16 percent rather than 19.1 percent as forecast at the
beginning of the year.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini Wednesday evening ruled out the prospect of taking over as
International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director to replace
Michel Camdessus next year, Italian news agency Ansa reported.
</P>
<P>
Dini was quoted as saying he had noticed his name mentioned in
the press as a possible successor to Camdessus, "but I believe it
is my primary duty to stay on my job in the government and
continue the mandate entrusted to me by the voters."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister, who is heading his own small political
party "Italian Renewal", explained this mandate as "loyally
supporting the ruling center-left coalition, of which Italian
Renewal is a part, especially in this unquiet political phase."
</P>
<P>
Camdessus, a French, who had held the top IMF job for 13 years
since 1987, said Tuesday that he intended to leave two years
before the end of his third term and that he expected to see a
successor named by mid-February next year.
</P>
<P>
Dini was IMF alternate governor for Italy before moving to the
Bank for International Settlements in 1994.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Colombian farmers
continued a blockade of the Pan-American Highway in the country's
southwestern area to protest the government's failure to resolve

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration
said on Wednesday that Cuba is not on a list of countries which
the United States accused of not making enough efforts in fighting
drugs and the U.S. seeks anti-drug cooperation with the Caribbean
country.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has signed the list, and sent it to
Capitol Hill, said State Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
The list, published by the U.S. administration annually, was
severely criticized by the listed countries, who believe it is an
interference of their domestic affairs. The U.S. may take
sanctions against the listed countries.
</P>
<P>
This year's unpopular list includes 26 countries and
territories, two fewer than last year's.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Cuba is not on the list because "there is no clear
evidence that cocaine or heroin are transiting Cuba on the way to
the United States in quantities that significantly affect the
United States."
</P>
<P>
"According to our government's interagency assessment of
cocaine movement, during the first half of 1999, there was no
cocaine detected transiting Cuban soil or ports on the way to the
United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman urged Cuba to take more steps on
anti-drug campaign while expressing his hope to cooperate with
Cuba in this field.
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is important for Cuba to take steps to improve
its interdiction efforts, including cooperation with other nations
in the region. We are taking certain steps in this regard, and we
would want to see improved bilateral cooperation," he said.

HAVANA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Cuban State Council vice
President Carlos Lage Wednesday criticized the United States for
exercising pressures on other chiefs of state, to impede their
presence at the 9th Inter-American Summit in Havana.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made after the official inauguration of the
press center of the summit, scheduled for Nov. 15-16, Lage said
that these U.S. actions were confirmed Tuesday by the U.S. State
Department.

Lage said that in one declaration released by the U.S. State
Department, they explained how the pressure was put upon the Ibero
American chiefs of state so that they would not assist the summit,
or in the case of attendance, what they should do in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
He said that these actions were carried out in a disrespectful
and humiliating manner to address other countries, and added that
the actions were being made public.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. pressures had previously been denounced by Cuban
President Fidel Castro and Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque.
</P>

At the press center, Lage expressed confidence that the summit
will make contribution in a profound and convenient way for the
Latin American integration.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A Colombian cargo
plane on Wednesday disappeared when it flew close to the neutral
zone in the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
The plane, a DC-3 belonging to the Alianza company, was
traveling between Orito, in the province of Putumayo, and
Villavicencio, the capital of the province of Meta.
</P>
<P>
Civil AeronCautics (Aerocivil) announced its disappearance two
hours after losing contact with the plane.
</P>
<P>
The last contact made with the plane was received by the
control tower of the Florencia airport, capital of the Caqueta
province.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from Aerocivil said the plane had presumably
disappeared in the neutral zone, which covers 42,139 square
kilometers, declared by the government to allow talks with the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
</P>
<P>
The plane was not carrying any cargo, said a spokesman from the
Alianza company, who identified the pilots as Jorge Pedromo and
Aldemar Gomez, and the mechanic as Silverio Rincon, the only
people on board the plane.
</P>
<P>
Both planes and helicopters left Villavicencio and Florencia in

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Guagua Pichincha Volcano to Erupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's Guagua Pichincha
volcano continues its intense seismic activity, and is nearing a
violent eruption.
</P>
<P>
Volcanologists from Ecuador's Geophysical Institute of the
National Polytechnic School (IGEPN) said that an incandescent rock
with a temperature of 700 degrees centigrade rolled down the side
of the volcano, and when it touched soil there was a terrific
explosion, on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The experts said the volcano Guagua Pichincha, 10 kilometers to
the east of Quito, expulsed ash and water vapor on Tuesday
evening and continued its activity until early Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
According to the IGEPN, the new dome of the Guagua Pichincha
is, at 4,794 meters above sea level, larger than the original,
thus constituting a great threat, for which reason they are
expecting a thunderous eruption, accompanied by ash and pulverised
rock.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the IGEPN confirmed that since October 28 they
have registered at least three seismic movements of considerable
duration on a daily basis, which signifies a great build up of
accumulated energy and is expected to be released from the dome
measuring 200 x 240 meters and has a height of 50 meters.
</P>
<P>
Confronted by the possibility of a large eruption, the
metropolitan area of Quito, on Tuesday, declared a "yellow alert",
while the Ministry of Education announced the suspension of
classes in both public and private sector schools, as a precaution
against the possibility of falling ash.

protection of the health of babies," the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
The environmental protection group said both ban proposals
would only cover the toys intended to be put into the mouth. "All
toys that are not meant for teething but are likely to end up in a
child's mouth would merely be labelled to be kept out of mouth", a
measure which could take 3-4 years to take effect.
</P>
<P>
In addition, no immediate market withdrawal of the banned toys
is foreseen in the EU Commission proposal, Greenpeace said. "The
only concession the Commission makes is to ask the Scientific
Committee of Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment whether the
ban should cover all toys for children under three in the future,
the Greenpeace added in a statement.

WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A New York State Senate
committee offered some recommendations to clean up boxing
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The state Senate investigations committee, after conducting a
probe of the fight game, called for the abolition of the current
sanctioning organizations and the creation of a national group; a
limit on promoter-fighter contracts to one year, and changes in
ranking system for boxers.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Roy Goodman, head of the investigations committee, called
for the passage of the Muhammad Ali Boxing Act, which received U.S.
House of Representatives approval two days ago. Ali, the former
three-time heavyweight champion, endorsed the bill.
</P>
<P>
The major provisions of that act included the same limitation
on promoter-fighter contracts and a call for uniform criteria for
ranking boxers.
</P>
<P>
"The closer we get to boxing, the more pronounced is the stench,
" said Goodman. "If the current situation is allowed to continue,
the sport will die in the near future."

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed With Dow Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended
mixed with the Dow Jones industrial average falling Wednesday as
the government report on wholesale prices sparked concerns about
inflation.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading, the Dow index fell 19.58 at 10,597.74,
expanding its losses of 101.53 points Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poors rose 8.18 at 1,373.46 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index rose 30.92 at 3,155.96.
</P>
<P>
The market fell initially after the Labor Department reported
that sharp declines in the cost of energy and food drove wholesale
prices down by 0.1 percent in October but without the volatile
energy and food categories, the "core" rate of inflation at the
wholesale level in the same period rose a strong-than-expected 0.3
percent that could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise intereat
rates for the third time this year to cool off the U.S. economy at
the meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
Fears of higher interest rates sank most of financial stocks,
dragging the industrial average lower.
</P>
<P>
But technology stocks bounced back as Cisco, the Internet
equipment maker, said its second-quarter earnings may be better
than expected as concerns over the Year 2000 computer bug have
lessened. The Nasdaq index rose again after the break of its seven
straight record Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 3.03 at 629.02 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 3.50 at 815.81. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 2.44 at 448.72.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange with 1,647 down, 1,418 up and 496
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> EU Executive Proposes Ban on PVC Toys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
proposed Wednesday a ban on soft polyvinyl chloride (PVC) teething
toys for children under three years old.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the European Union (EU) executive
branch proposes an emergency ban on the use of hazardous substances
in consumer products.
</P>
<P>
The proposal now moves to the Product Safety Emergencies
Committee of the EU Member States in two weeks time, possibly
followed by a debate at EU level if no agreement can be reached in
the committee.
</P>
<P>
The emergency ban sets a precedent on product safety in Europe,
said Greenpeace, the international group for environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
The EU first took up the issue of soft PVC toys in September
1997. Since then the Scientific Committee of Toxicity, Ecotoxicity
and the Environment of the European Commission has issued five
opinions about PVC, the toxic chemical material.
</P>
<P>
The Commission, which is mainly responsible for proposing and
conducting EU regulations, has repeatedly confirmed the toxicity of
the phthalate softeners and voiced concerns due to their release
rates.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive also stressed that the tests to measure
phthalate release rates from soft PVC toys as developed in the
Netherlands and Britain are unsuitable for regulatory purposes as
they have poor reproducibility, and that the use of certain
alternative softeners can not be supported.
</P>
<P>
The commission pointed instead to alternative materials which
do not require softeners.
</P>
<P>
However, the Greenpeace said the proposed EU measures "tackle
the problem only half-heartedly - the new European commission
failed to ensure full protection of the health of babies".

<HEADLINE> Britain's Queen Calls for Anglo-Boer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and the
United Kingdom should commemorate the centenary of the Anglo-Boer
South African war in a spirit of reconciliation, Queen Elizabeth
II said in Pretoria on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We should remember with sadness the loss of life and
sufferings, not only of British or Boer soldiers, but of all those
caught up in the war -- black and white, men, women and children,"
she said at a state banquet held in her honor at the presidential
guest house.
</P>
<P>
"No one who reads of the distressing conditions in the
detention camps which held both black and white detainees could
fail to be moved, even today, 100 years later," she was quoted by
the South African Press Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
The centenary of this war should be commemorated in a spirit of
 reconciliation, she said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 24,000 women and children died in
the British concentration camps during the war.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, a group of protesters gathered outside the
Union Buildings where the Queen met President Thabo Mbeki. They
waved placards demanding an apology from the Queen for the war.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the banquet, Mbeki said that "as South Africans we
have approached the Anglo-Boer South African War centenary in a
spirit of reconciliation and nation building. Long divided by
racism, we now have the opportunity and possibility to unite and
together say -- 'Never again should our country fall victim to
war'."
</P>
<P>
The two countries had a complex history which had led to the
establishment of intricate relations between them, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
He said the relationship between South Africa and the United
Kingdom is almost two centuries old and at times it was a
tempestuous one.
</P>
<P>
"Our people have fought against each other, as they have also
fought together against a common enemy," he said referring to the
Anglo-Boer South African War and the first and second world wars.
</P>
<P>
The Queen said it is important not to forget the painful events
in the two countries' shared history.
</P>
<P>
"But it is better still to find encouragement in the close ties
which bind our countries together," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said these ties have found expression in strong commercial
and investment links, the number of Britons who are living in the
country and the sporting relationships between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and the United Kingdom share many characteristics,
she said, noting that both countries are home to people from many
different cultures and to a generation whose views are not formed
by the great conflicts that shaped the lives of older generations.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa is set fair
RETRAINING

CONNECT 2400/LAPM
to become a symbol of how African
countries can combine democratic accountability, economic success
and improved living standards," she said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the African renaissance, the Queen said she has
seen positive change taking root in South Africa, Ghana,
Mozambique and elsewhere on the continent.
</P>
<P>
She stopped over at Ghana en-route to South Africa and will
visit Mozambique shortly.
</P>
<P>
The Queen and her husband arrived in South Africa on Tuesday
night, ahead of the Commonwealth summit, due to start on Friday in
Durban.

BONN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General George

The strong "leading role" of the United States during the

</P>
<P>
The Kosovo war also shows that more internal work is necessary

</P>
<P>
Robertson and Fischer issued a joint plea for Moscow to
negotiate a peaceful solution in Chechnya to "spare civilian
suffering."
</P>
<P>
The two agreed that "there must be a political solution in
Chechnya but not a military one," Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the weapons will soon be silenced," he told a
press conference following their talks in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said he "was most concerned about the humanitarian
disaster that for many people is already a reality."
</P>
<P>
Robertson said they had also discussed efforts to bring Russia
closer into the European security and defense framework.
</P>
<P>
Another issue at their talks was next week's summit of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in
Istanbul.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) announced Wednesday the approval of a loan
of 8.4 million U.S. dollars to Jamaica to assist the government in
establishing a more dynamic, equitable and efficient land market.
</P>
<P>
The IDB said the resources will finance new technological and
administrative processes and better management and planning in
four areas: land registration, public land management, land
information management, and land use planning and development.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to improve the accessibility of all
segments of the population, including low-income groups, to land
markets, as well as to provide greater protection to property
rights of all sectors of society, including women heads of
households, through existing legal norms.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the project will reduce legal uncertainty and lead
to greater access to credit and more investment in sounder and
more productive land use.
</P>
<P>
Among the results of the program, some 270,000 certificates of
title and 5,000 deposited land sue plans will be computerized and
indexed. In the targeted parish of St. Catherine, land tenure for
30,000 parcels will be clarified.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the program, to be carried out by the
Ministry of Environment and Housing, is 12 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IDB loan is for a 20-year term, with a three-year grace
period, at the variable interest rate, now 6.84 percent. Local
counterpart funds total 3.6 million dollars.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Supreme
Justice Court on Wednesday authorized the extradition of the
alleged Venezuelan drug trafficker, Fernando Jose Flores, to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The authorization of the handing over of the Venezuelan, who
was involved with the drug trafficking cartel of Cali, to the
United States, is the second to receive the green light from the
Supreme Court, after the decision to hand over Colombian Jaime
Orlando Lara Nausa on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Both decisions need ratification by the executive power within
a ten day period.
</P>
<P>
In Colombia, the extradition of nationals was abolished in
1991, but was later re-established in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The president of the penal court said that the authorization of
the handing over of Venezuelan Fernando Jose Flores to the United
States was agreed upon due to the constitutional reform made in
1997.

If confirmed, the extradition of these two people will be the
first ones since the law was reinstigated.

<HEADLINE> Canada Reports 3.1 Percent in GDP Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada had a growth of 3.1
percent in the gross domestic product (GDP) in 1998, Statistics
Canada reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
leading the growth was the Atlantic province of Newfoundland,
where oil production and related spin-off brought the local GDP
growth to 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ontario was another province of high growth, which was expected
at 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Weak commodity prices, especially for oil and farm products,
led to a modest growth on the Prairies.
</P>
<P>
Of the country's major three agricultural provinces,
Saskatchewanon reported 1.2 percent growth, Manitoba fared better
with a growth rate of 3.3 percent and Alberta saw its growth at
3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the west, British Columbia reaped only 0.2 percent in its
GDP growth, one of the lowest among the country's 10 provinces.
The Pacific province took a jolt as Asian markets dried up,
according to the official statistics.
