<HEADLINE> IMF Team Starts Discussion With Pak Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 3 (Xinhua) -- An International Monetary Fund (
IMF) delegation has started discussions with senior officials of
Pakistan's Ministry of Finance, official sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The five-member delegation, led by the Fund's Assistant
Director for Middle East Sena Eken, arrived here on Monday to hold
talks with the Pakistani government on replacing the Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) loans with Poverty Reduction
and Growth Program (PRGP).
</P>
<P>
The IMF announced the PRGP on the eve of the new millenium and
had withdrawn its various existing programs, specially for the
developing and underdeveloped countries.
</P>
<P>
The existing ESAF program in Pakistan will be replaced with the
PRGP, Pakistan's Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz told media on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Under the ESAF, the IMF pledged assistance of 1.56 billion U.S.
dollars to Pakistan and the third tranche of 280 million dollars
was suspended after Pakistan went for unclear tests in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank will also take part in the talks between the IMF and the
Pakistani government, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
During its 10-day stay in Pakistan, the IMF delegation will
also review the performance of various governmental departments of
the country including the Revenue Division, they said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Court Prepares Trial of Rwandan Genocide Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Prosecutor of the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) has said the
preparation for trial of genocide suspect Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza
is underway.
</P>
<P>
According to Monday sources from Arusha where ICTR locates,
Carla Del Ponte said in a statement from the Hague that the ICTR
welcomed the Appeals Court decision allowing the case to continue.
</P>
<P>
"No date has yet been fixed for the start of trial," she said,
however, discussions will resume between the prosecution and
defense on issues of evidence and procedure in order to start the
trial as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Appeals Court last Friday reversed its decision to release
Barayagwiza, former Rwandan director of Political Affairs in the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Barayagwiza will remain in the ICTR detention facilities in
northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the ICTR Appeals Court has agreed to
revise a decision, normally considered to be final.
</P>
<P>
On November 3 last year, the Appeal Court ordered Barayagwiza's
 immediate release on the grounds that his rights had been
repeatedly violated during his initial detention in Cameroon and
after his transfer to the U.N. prison in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
The initial decision was based on the fact that Barayagwiza was
held for 19 months in Cameroon without being informed of the
charges against him, while the ICTR provisional detention is not
supposed to exceed 90 days.
</P>
<P>
That decision led the Rwandan government to suspend its
cooperation with the ICTR till February when the ICTR Prosecutor
applied for a review of the decision on the ground that she had
new facts.
</P>
<P>
The new decision confirmed that the rights of the appellant had
been infringed during his prolonged detention but on a
considerably smaller scale than it had deemed in last decision.
</P>
<P>
The judges of the Appeal Court said that Barayagwiza should be
tried by the ICTR, but that the violation of his rights would be
taken into account at the time of his judgement by the Trial
Chamber.
</P>
<P>
They said that if the Court found Barayagwiza innocent, he
would be entitled to financial compensation for the violations; if
guilty, his eventual sentence is to be reduced to take account of
the infringement of his rights.
</P>
<P>
Barayagwiza, 50, arrested on March 27, 1996, was a founder
member of the Radio Television des Mille Collines, which incited
Hutus to kill Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
He played an important role as the foreign policy advisor to
the Rwandan interim government in the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda has hailed the latest ICTR decision, saying it was a
victory for genocide victims.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda has argued that the sufferings of Barayagwiza as a
result of a violation of his rights are negligible as compared to
the sufferings of the victims and survivors of genocide.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR, created on November 8, 1994 by the United Nations
Security Council resolution 955, is responsible to try suspects
involved in the 100- day massacre starting on April 7, 1994 and
killing 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR has so far issued 28 indictments against 45
individuals, and a total of 38 indicted individuals are in custody
including several former senior cabinet ministers in former
interim government, former military commanders, political leaders,
journalists and senior businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The five detainees who have already been convicted by the Trial
Chambers of the Tribunal are still held in Arusha, pending outcome
of their appeals.
</P>
<P>
Three of the convicts were sentenced to life imprisonment and
the other two were sentenced to 25 and 15 years of imprisonment
respectively.

<HEADLINE> First Africa-Europe Summit Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The first-ever Africa-Europe summit
ended here on Tuesday with the issuing of a final declaration and
adopting of a plan of action.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika, Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity
Salem Amhad Salem and European Union (EU) Foreign Affairs and
Security Coordinator Javier Solana addressed the closing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the summit as having succeeded in reflecting the depth
of historical relations between Africa and Europe, Mubarak said it
also was able to come up with joint positive visions of how the two
continents' future should be like.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's remarks are in tune with the theme of the first-ever
such summit that was designed to forge a new and strategic
relationship between the two continents in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak expressed hope that the end of the summit
would be the beginning of real partnership, with serious work on
that score getting underway.
</P>
<P>
He also pressed for immediate action on solving pending problems
between the two sides, with emphasis on the African debt crisis.
</P>
<P>
During the summit on Monday and Tuesday, the leaders from 66
African states and European Union (EU) member countries discussed a
wide range of political, economic and social development issues,
with calls from African countries for debt reduction or
cancellation dominating the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The total African external debts have reached staggering 350
billion U.S. dollars and African states are spending 23 billion
dollars, or 30.9 percent of their exports, to service the debts
every year. Africa's average annual economic growth stands at 3
percent while the debt growth rate reached a stunning 23 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the "can't pay" debts sap the revenues of African
countries needed for health, education as well as economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Many leading African leaders noted at the summit that they
realized Africa has lagged far behind and is risking pushing
further outside the development movement with the advent of the
economic globalization, hoping to shed underdevelopment through
more and better EU cooperation for mutual benefit and debt relief
instead of more aid and charity.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the 15 EU member states are former colonial powers in
Africa and the EU gives Africa 15 billion dollars every five years,
more than any other single source. It is also the major creditor of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The final declaration expressed deep concern over the increasing
debt burden on Africa, and welcomed the enhancement of the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries initiative launched in 1996 and the
concrete debt-relief moves taken by EU members.
</P>
<P>
France Monday promised to cancel all bilateral debts owed it by
the poorest African countries in one or two years, while Germany
and Morocco also announced to write off part of the states' debts.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to continue to discuss the debt issue
at their next summit slated for 2003.
</P>
<P>
But pushing a comprehensive debt relief proved not to be an easy
job. Some European countries insisted they have done much to
alleviate the debt burden, they should not shoulder more
responsibilties. Austrian Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero-
Waldner has said that "I think the Africans cannot ask everything
from us Europeans."
</P>
<P>
In addition, they also favored to link the debt reduction or
forgiveness to these countries' economic reforms, democracy
process, human rights and good governance.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said at the third session
of the summit said "the political renaissance of Africa provides
the best foundation for the economic renaissance of Africa."
</P>
<P>
As for conflicts in Africa, the declaration called for peaceful
solutions in solving the issue under the U.N. Charter and the
principle of respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity to
pave the way for economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to set up a joint mechanism to end the conflicts
that are raging in 14 African countries, according to both the
declaration and the plan of action.
</P>
<P>
The documents said the leaders also deplored all forms of
terrorism and were determined to fight against terrorism through
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the economic and technological issues, the
documents expressed the participants' readiness to support the
efforts of African countries in continuing adopting sound macro-
economic measures and reform programs, including economic structure
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
The declaration underlined EU's determination to pay due
attention to trade liberalization as a mechanism, and the
establishment and support of the process of technology transfer to
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also agreed to hold a summit every three years, a
ministerial meeting each year and experts meetings twice a year to
follow up steps aimed at boosting cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Africa, EU Pledge to Give Strategic Dimension to Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 4 (Xinhua) -- African and European Union (EU)
leaders on Tuesday pledged to give a new strategic dimension to
the partnership between Africa and Europe for the 21st century
through dialog on economic, political, social and development
issues.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the first-ever Africa-Europe summit, the leaders
of 67 African and EU countries issued the Cairo Declaration, which
demonstrated consensus on a wide range of issues included in 110
articles.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said the leaders agreed to work together to
integrate Africa into the world economy and enhance its prospects
of economic development through trade liberalization, encouraging
private sector investment, regional cooperation and development
aid.
</P>
<P>
They would exert efforts to reduce Africa's 350 billion U.S.
dollars of external debt, through existing initiatives for highly-
indebted poor countries, and have a senior officials' group from
both regions submit a report to ministers on the issue "within a
reasonable time frame."
</P>
<P>
The leaders would help reinforce African and regional mechanisms
for conflict prevention, management and resolution by strengthening
the mechanisms of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
developing an OAU early warning system and improving Africa's own
operational capabilities for peacekeeping and conflict resolution.
</P>
<P>
The African and EU countries will take measures to stop the
illegal exploitation of natural resources and illicit trade in
high-value commodities such as diamonds, and to increase
cooperation against terrorism and illicit trafficking of small
arms.
</P>
<P>
The countries will have senior officials from both regions study
and report to ministers on the legal and practical consequences of
further action to return cultural goods stolen or exported
illegally.
</P>
<P>
They are to create a follow-up mechanism with further summits "
based on the principle of continuity," the next one to be held in
Europe in 2003, with a meeting of ministers between summits, plus a
bi-regional group of senior officials.

<HEADLINE> Israel Increases Funds for Fortifying Northern Settlements: Deputy DM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Deputy Defense Minister
Ephraim Sneh announced on Tuesday that his ministry has increased
its budget for reinforcing security of northern settlements by 14
million shekels (about 3.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
While touring northern settlements along the border between
Israel and Lebanon, Sneh also said further budgets, if they are
needed, will be available in the future, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
These settlements are facing the threat of possible cross-border
guerrilla attacks after Israel Defense Forces scheduled withdrawal
from the Israeli-occupied security zone in south Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
The 15-kilometer-deep buffer zone was set up by Israel in 1985
with a self-claimed aim of preventing such attacks on its north.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas, a Shiite Muslim
militant group in the zone, has been fighting to end the Israeli
occupation. The militia launched Katyusha rocket attacks several
times in the past years against Israel's settlements along the
northern border, causing some casualties.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the guerrillas escalated its activities in
south Lebanon, killing seven Israeli soldiers and a senior
commander of Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas also threatened to launch Katyusha attacks again,
which forced Israeli settlers in these towns to lock themselves in
their bomb shelters and basements for nearly a week.
</P>
<P>
To ease growing public pressure, the Israeli cabinet on March 5
gave backing to a key pledge made by Barak to withdraw from the
zone by July, with or without a peace deal with Syria, the major
power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Some experts predicted that Hezbollah, which is backed by Syria
and Iran, will not keep Israel's northern border quiet in the case
of a pullout without agreements.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with visiting U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Cohen on Monday, Barak said that Israel is the strongest
country in the region and he doubts whether there will be any
country venturing to test its strains by attacking its northern
settlements.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti DM Re-stresses Importance to Buy U.S. Howitzers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister
and Defense Minister Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah on Tuesday re-emphasized
the importance to buy the U.S.-made Paladin howitzers.
</P>
<P>
In remarks to Kuwait News Agency, Sheikh Salem underlined the
need to purchase the U.S. guns "because the Ministry of Defense
needs this formidable machinery and in order to develop Kuwait's
arsenal."
</P>
<P>
But the official said that any final decision regarding the
purchase needs a political decision, adding that "as for the
technical decision, we have already taken it."
</P>
<P>
This was the second time within two weeks the Kuwaiti defense
chief stressed the need to go ahead with the controversial
purchase.
</P>
<P>
On March 20, Sheikh Salem said Kuwait was still wishing and
insisting on purchasing the American guns because the Army needs
them.
</P>
<P>
The Public Fund Protection Committee at the Parliament has been
studying, since last December, the purchase of the Paladin
howitzers in a deal estimated at some 400 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The committee was supposed to report to the parliament about the
deal later last month.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait planned to equip three battalions with howitzers and has
received offers from several big powers including the United
States, which are worth of some 750 million dollars. The U.S.
offered its M109 A6 Paladin howitzers.
</P>
<P>
But the purchase sparked controversy in Kuwait's previous
parliament, with many lawmakers arguing that the U.S-made Paladin
is outmoded and not compatible with the Kuwait armament system.

<HEADLINE> UNFPA Hails Bill Gates Contribution to African Anti-Aids Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A grant of 57 million U.S.
dollars from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will
tremendously strengthen efforts to protect young people in four
African countries against HIV/AIDS, the United Nations Population
Fund (UNFPA) announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Foundation is funding a five-year initiative to expand
national campaign in Botswana, Ghana, Uganda and the United
Republic of Tanzania that will educate youth about preventing HIV/
AIDS and ensure that they can protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
The government of each country, in partnership with the UNFPA,
and two U.S.-based international nongovernmental organizations,
Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH), Pathfinder
International, and local groups will implement the programs, UNFPA
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Bill &AMP; Melinda Gates Foundation has once again shown its
enormous commitment to young people in developing countries and to
halting the devastating AIDS pandemic," the UNFPA executive
director, Nafis Sadik, said.
</P>
<P>
"This grant puts resources where the need is most urgent:
protecting the most vulnerable and safeguarding each country's
future. The programs it supports will also serve as models for
other hard-hit countries and international aid efforts," she said.
"And it will help the international community move towards its
stated goal of reducing HIV/AIDS infections by 25 percent by 2005.
"
</P>
<P>
In sub-Saharan Africa, where AIDS is ravaging families,
communities and national economies, half the population is under
age 20. Half of all new cases of HIV infection are among young
people age 15 to 24. In several countries, girls aged 15 to 19 are
five or six times more likely to be HIV-positive than boys their
own age, indicating a critical need to avoid infection.
</P>
<P>
The Bill &AMP; Melinda Gates Foundation is dedicated to improving
people's lives by sharing advances in health and learning with the
global community. Led by Bill Gates' father, William H. Gates, Sr.,
and Patty Stonesifer, the Seattle-based Foundation have an asset
base of 21.8 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> France Rules Out New Devaluation of African Franc </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- France ruled out on Tuesday a new
devaluation of the African franc which is pegged with the European
single currency euro because of its fixed rate with the French
franc.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the ministers of finance of the African franc
zone held in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, French Minister of
Cooperation Charles Josselin and State Secretary for Exterior
Trade Francois Huwart said the African franc, or CFA franc, still
remains competitive after its 50 percent devaluation in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Rumors on a devaluation of the African franc has been
circulating because of the high exchange rate between the euro and
other currencies and the replace of the French franc by euro in
two years' time.
</P>
<P>
French officials said that while the French franc will
disappear when the euro becomes currency in 2002, the African
franc will remain.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate between the French franc and African franc is
fixed at one for 100.

The shipment of meat, which departed from San Francisco on a
plane bound for Shanghai on Sunday night, "represents the first
direct opening of China's market to U.S. meat and poultry
producers," said U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
"Direct exports of U.S. meat to China should increase
dramatically as further market opening and sales opportunities are
presented by China's accession to the WTO. But full access will
only happen if Congress votes to approve permanent normal trade
relations with China," she said.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who announced the shipment
along with Barshefsky, said that China, as one of the world's
largest and fastest growing economies, holds "enormous potential
for growing agricultural exports."
</P>
<P>
The shipment of meat, which was imported by City Supermarket
Company Limited in Shanghai, came after China decided to buy its
first shipment of wheat from the Pacific Northwest earlier this
month, and shipments of citrus sailed from ports in Florida and
California last week.
</P>
<P>
"The first shipment of U.S. citrus to China in 20 years, a
contract pending for a shipment of U.S. wheat, and now this
shipment of U.S. beef and pork demonstrates the tangible benefits
of increased trade with China," Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope and expect that these shipments are only the first of
many more sales to come," he added.
</P>
<P>
China issued new rules governing the importation of U.S. citrus,
meat, and wheat on March 22, in an effort to implement the
Agreement on U.S.-China Agricultural Cooperation. The agreement,
signed on April 10, 1999, lifted long-standing bans on the export
of U.S. citrus, wheat and other grains from the Pacific Northwest,
and meat and poultry.
</P>
<P>
China imported 1.3 million metric tons of beef, pork, and
poultry from all sources in 1999. U.S. meat exports are shipped to
China, but as transshipments through Hong Kong. In 1999, Hong Kong
was the fourth largest market for U.S. pork and pork variety meat
exports, with a value of 32.3 million dollars, and more than half
of these imports were transshipped to China, according to a news
release from the office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

MEXICO CITY, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Guatemalan congress
defense commission approved Tuesday a project of eventual joint
anti-narcotic patrolling between military and police forces of
this country and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The commission will turn over this project to full congress for
its subsequent approval or rejection, said Deputy Byron

The project foresees authorization of air, land and sea
patrolling on anti-drug missions between American soldiers and
members of the army and the Civil National Police of the
Department of Anti-narcotic Operations of Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
"Drug trafficking could become a very serious problem if not
controlled. This method (joint patrols) is a way to fight it,"
said Barrientos of the governing Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG).
</P>

The project has been censured by different political forces

<HEADLINE> Robertson, Albright Meet Over European Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference following a meeting here,
Robertson called Russia a "strategic partner" with which NATO will
discuss common security problems.
</P>
<P>
The two met to prepare for NATO's meeting next month in
Florence, Italy. Robertson said European allies are assuming some
of the burden that has been carried disproportionally by the
United States in dealing with security problems in Europe.
</P>
<P>
On the European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI), Robertson
said, it "is designed to strengthen NATO and to, inside the
Alliance, share more of the burdens."
</P>
<P>
"I will remain vigilant and robust, and I'll make sure that the
Alliance's interests are the major interests and the ones that
will be paramount," he added.
</P>
<P>
Albright reiterated the U.S. support for ESDI, saying the
United States is "most supportive of it."
</P>
<P>
"The interests of allies who are not EU members have to be
protected, and our twin goals are an EU that is more effective on
security issues and an Alliance that remains united and strong,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
Robertson, who visited Moscow recently, told reporters that the
relationship with Russia has been resumed after his visit.
</P>
<P>
The relationship "is built on the NATO-Russia Founding Act"
while NATO and Russia should join together to "deal with and to
discuss the problems that face us together, and not trying to deal
with them on a separate and isolated basis," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow cut off its the relationship with NATO on March 24 last
year when NATO launched a 78-day air campaign against Yugoslavia,
a close ally of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Russia's Security Council approved a new
doctrine in February but it will not be published until an amended
version has been signed by President-elect Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
The published draft doctrine says that Russia will use all
possible means, including nuclear weapons to ward off a foreign
aggression.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Wesley Clark, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in
Europe, said that the new doctrine, which upgrades the role of
nuclear weapons, was a step in the wrong direction and should be
revised.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Army to Buy Over 1,200 New-Generation Helicopters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a press conference, the officials unveiled the Army's post-
Cold War aviation plan and said the service was "fully committed"
to obtain all of its planned new RAH-66 Comanches.
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of U.S. Army aviation in the 21st century is
supposed to be the Comanche, an armed reconnaissance helicopter
with more radar-evading stealth technology than any chopper in the
current fleet.
</P>
<P>
The Comanche helicopters will replace the OH-58 Kiowa Warrior
helicopters, which will be retired in 2013, about seven years
earlier than planned. The first Comanches are to enter the fleet
in 2006.
</P>
<P>
The Comanche is being produced by Boeing Co. and Sikorsky
Aircraft Corp., a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp.
</P>
<P>
The overall U.S. Army helicopter fleet will be reduced from six
types to four with the addition of the Comanche.
</P>
<P>
The last of the AH-1 Cobras, combat mainstays in the Vietnam
War that now average 30 years old, will be retired this October,
and UH-1 Huey helicopters will be retired in 2004. That will leave
the UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopter fleet, the Vietnam-era CH-
47 Chinook transports and the AH-64 Apache attack helicopters.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Foundation to Help African Countries Fight AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A United States-based
foundation announced Tuesday to offer 57 million U.S. dollars to
help four African countries fight against HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The grant from the Bill &AMP; Melinda Gates Foundation will
tremendously strengthen efforts to protect young people in
Botswana, Ghana, Uganda and Tanzania against HIV/AIDS, the United
Nations Population Fund said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The foundation is funding a five-year initiative to expand
national campaigns which will educate youth about preventing
HIV/AIDS and ensure that they can protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
Led by billionaire Bill Gates' father, William H. Gates, Sr.,
and Patty Stonesifer, the Seattle-based foundation is dedicated to
improving people's lives by sharing advances in health and
learning with the global community.
</P>
<P>
"This grant puts resources where the need is most urgent:
protecting the most vulnerable and safeguarding each country's
future. The programs it supports will also serve as models for
other hard-hit countries and international aid efforts.
</P>
<P>
"And it will help the international community move towards its
stated goal of reducing HIV/AIDS infections in the most affected
countries by 25 percent by 2005," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
In sub-Saharan Africa, where AIDS is ravaging families,
communities and national economies, half of all new cases of HIV
infection are among young people aged 15-24.
</P>
<P>
In several countries, girls aged 15-19 are five or six times
more likely to be HIV-positive than boys in the same age group,
indicating a critical need to empower adolescent girls, in
particular, with the information and means to avoid infection.
</P>
<P>
Currently very few young people in the countries concerned are
being reached with HIV/AIDS prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
The four countries were chosen based on need and on their
demonstrated commitment to HIV/AIDS prevention among youth.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Tuesday called for flexibility in the eligibility criteria for
debt relief initiative to cover more deserving countries when he
addressed the Afro- European summit which closed Tuesday in Cairo,
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Moi welcomed the current debt relief initiative
by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Group
of 7, saying that initiatives were limited in scope and not
prompt, the Presidential Press Service reported in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Noting that substantial percentage of domestic revenue was
spent on debt serving, Moi said that this led to economic
stagnation due to reduced investment.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Africa still needed more development
assistance for infrastructure, and support for promotion of good
governance, transparency, accountability and prevention of
corruption among other programs.
</P>
<P>
Even if all external debts were cancelled entirely, Africa
would still need more assistance owing to the extremely fragile
economies, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moi also appealed to Africa's development partners for
supporting in addressing such issues as poverty alleviation and
HIV/AIDS, and for cooperation in implementing food policies
especially in areas of production, processing, marketing and
distribution.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Pursues Just, Comprehensive Peace in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime and Defense Minister
Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh said Tuesday his kingdom was determined to push
forward the Middle East peace process and to work on a just,
durable and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh made the remarks in a meeting with visiting U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen, who is on a 12-day mission to the
region.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh and Cohen reviewed relations between Jordan and the
United States in all fields, particularly in the military and
defense fields, and the latest developments of the peace process
between Israel and its Arab neighbors, Jordan's official news
agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister expressed his government's appreciation for
U.S. aid to Jordan, which amounted to some 300 million U.S. dollars
in 1999 in various economic and military packages as a reward for
its role as a major peace broker in the region after it signed a
peace treaty with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh also said he hoped to enhance military and defense
cooperation between the two countries, which he said was of a great
importance for Jordan to continue its role of promoting peace in
the region.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Cohen praised Jordan's efforts to achieve a just,
durable and comprehensive peace in the region. He said Washington
was keen to enhance the defensive capabilities of the kingdom,
which Washington takes as an ally in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived in Amman earlier in the day for a two-day visit as
part of his regional tour, which has also taken him to Nigeria,
Israel, Cairo and will take him to six Gulf Arab states, to promote
military cooperation between the U.S. and these countries.

<HEADLINE> U.N., U.S., UK Agree to Accelerate Cyprus Reconciliation Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations, the United
States and the United Kingdom agree to speed up the Cyprus
reconciliation process on the next round of U.N.-sponsored
proximity talks on Cyprus, the Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported
from New York on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, envoys from the three sides will pay another
visit to the region in seven weeks prior to the talks to urge
Cyprus' two sides to be as flexible as possible on the proposals
they have put forward during the last two rounds of talks.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in a meeting in New York on Monday among
U.N. Secretary-General's Special Adviser Alvaro de Soto, U.S.
Presidential Emissary Alfred Moses and British representative for
Cyprus Sir David Hannay.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretariat sources told CNA that Monday's meeting was part
of "normal consultations" which concentrated on "developments in
the island and particularly preparations for the next round of the
proximity talks."
</P>
<P>
A British government source at the U.N. headquarters said that
all want to see "a change of gear" during the next round of the
proximity talks and "there has to be an acceleration of the
process."
</P>
<P>
The source said the three sides "are looking at what each can do
in the next seven weeks" and agreed to visit the region again in an
effort to move the process forward.
</P>
<P>
A source at the U.S. permanent mission at the U.N. said that the
three envoys all agreed that it is high time for more "substantive"
talks.
</P>
<P>
The source indicated that during the last two rounds of talks in
New York and Geneva the parties involved "were in a listening mode"
but now they have to "move forward."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island after a pro-
Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been pushing for reunification of Cyprus under a
bizonal, bicommunal federation formula but all efforts have so far
failed.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two communities have already completed two
rounds of proximity talks under U.N. auspices in an effort to find
a solution. They agreed to start a new round of talks in New York
on May 23.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: International Pressure Against Sanctions Mounting  by Li Xuejun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 4 (Xinhua) -- To protest the decade-long U.N.
sanctions on Iraq, a European airplane carrying three persons, with
no prior approval from the U.N., landed at Baghdad's Al-Rashed
military airport Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
It was the first group who arrived in Baghdad by plane
disregarding U.N. resolutions that require all flights to or from
Iraq must get permission from the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
At the airport, Jean-Marie Benjamin, head of the group, read a
declaration to the media, demanding an immediate and total lifting
of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin and his companions are among the growing numerous
figures worldwide calling for an end to the sanctions since 1990.
</P>
<P>
British Member of Parliament George Galloway arrived here by
plane in 1997 for the same aim.
</P>
<P>
At that time it was the first airplane from Europe that arrived
in Iraq since sanctions were clamped on the country after its
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Galloway, who is now on a visit to the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), has affirmed that the public opinion in the West has started
to show opposition to the continuation of the sanctions, Iraq's
English-language Baghdad Observer reported.
</P>
<P>
It is high time for the sanctions to be lifted, said Galloway.
</P>
<P>
Besides Galloway, more than 70 members of the U.S. Congress have
signed a letter to President Bill Clinton, calling for an end to
the humanitarian crisis in Iraq by having the sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has been strongly opposed ending the
sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The call by the U.S. Congressmen coincided with the resignations
of top U.N. officials in Baghdad in protest against the devastating
impact of the U.N. sanctions on the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Hans von Sponeck, who left his post as the U.N. Humanitarian
Coordinator for Iraq at the end of last month, has been a vocal
critic of the stringent U.N. sanctions, arguing the sanctions have
resulted in a true humanitarian tragedy in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sponeck followed the example of his predecessor, Denis Halliday,
who quit his job in mid-1998 after months of voicing similar views.
</P>
<P>
Jota Burkhart, ex-representative of the World Food Program in
Iraq, also resigned from her post in protest against the
continuation of sanction on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Within the U.N. Security Council, Russia, China and France have
been calling for ending the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In the Gulf area, UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-
Nahyan has demanded to stop the trade embargo on Iraq, emphasizing
the necessity of ending the sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi people, especially children and the elderly, have been
hardest hit by the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), during 1984-
1990, children who died below the age of five were 36.5 per
thousand, while the current figure stands at 120 per thousand in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Health Ministry has said that the sanctions have claimed
lives of more than 1.2 million people, and such a high mortality is
a direct result of malnutrition and medical shortage caused by the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In a recent report, the International Committee of the Red Cross
has drawn a grim picture of Iraqi people's lives under the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"Deteriorating living conditions, inflations and low salaries
make people's everyday lives a continuing struggle," said the
report.
</P>
<P>
However, there are already signals that the sanctions regime
have begun to erode.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain, who withdrew its ambassador from Iraq in 1990, has sent
charge d'affaires Hasan Malullah Al-Ansari back to its embassy in
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
A senior Arab diplomat has pointed out that Ansari's return
marked the reopening of Bahraini embassay.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain has followed Qatar and Oman to reactivate diplomatic
relations with Iraq recently.
</P>
<P>
There has been a thaw in relations between Iraq and its
traditional rivals such as Syria and Saudi Arabia, who took part in
the U.S.-led coalition against Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has opened an interests section in Syria, the first formal
diplomatic link between the two countries in almost 20 years. Syria
is expected to follow suit shortly.
</P>
<P>
Syria-influenced Lebanon has already restored diplomatic
relations with Iraq in October 1998, after a four-year break.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade between Iraq and Saudi Arabia has reached
more than 100 million U.S. dollars a year. In August last year,
Saudi Arabia released one million dollars of Iraqi assets frozen in
Saudi banks.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's neighboring countries, including Jordan and Turkey, have
benefited a lot from developing trade relations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's reconstruction, a lucrative market of about 200 billion
dollars, has been attracting flocks of trade officials and business
delegations worldwide to develop trade ties with Baghdad despite
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
These countries, including Russia, France, Italy, Spain,
Austria, India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia,
Mexico, are vying for a slice of Iraq's market by gaining contracts
under the U.N. oil-for-food program and trying to get a firm
foothold once the sanctions are lifted.
</P>
<P>
France, for example, has opened a trade center and upgraded its
representation in Iraq last year, sending a diplomat to run an
interests section in Baghdad for the first time since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Even the U.N. is showing a bit flexibility in dealing with Iraq.
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has called on the U.N. Sanctions
Committee to quicken the process of examining and approving Iraq's
contracts.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution on March
31 to allow Iraq to double the amount of fund it can use to import
oil spare parts, meaning that Iraq can draw 600 million dollars
from its oil revenues in six months to buy oil equipment and spare
parts within the framework of the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. deal now in its seventh phase, Iraq is allowed to
export limited amount of crude oil to finance imports of food,
medicine and other humanitarian supplies to help offset the effects
of the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Navy to Conduct Exercise With Live Ammunition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti army announced
Tuesday its naval forces will conduct an exercise with live
ammunition Wednesday near the Island of UM Al-Maradem near Kuwait's
southern border with Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the army's Moral Guidance and Public
Relations Department urged people and ships to keep away from
approaching the area of the maneuver, the Kuwait News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
But the statement didn't mention whether the drill will be
joined by the United States' forces stationed here.
</P>
<P>
Currently, marines of the United States' 5th Fleet are carrying
out a joint and combined training, dubbed "Eager Mace 2000", with
Kuwaiti armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The joint Kuwaiti-U.S. war games, which started on April 1 and
will last until April 25, include amphibious, ground, air and naval
training.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the joint exercise would also include a
mock assault on an uninhabited island to "demonstrate their
combined sea and land warfare operational capability."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and the U.S. signed a ten-year defense cooperation
agreement after a U.S.-led multi-national force freed Kuwait from
the Iraqi occupation in February 1991.
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, U.S. and Kuwaiti troops conducted joint war
games almost every year since 1991.

<HEADLINE> Annan Welcomes Assurances From Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Tuesday welcomed the assurances from Israel's
Foreign Minister, David Levy, that his country would cooperate
fully with the United Nations throughout the peace process in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
 Annan met Levy today in Geneva and discussed Israel's
withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his spokesman's office, Annan said
the Foreign Minister reaffirmed his Government's decision to
withdraw Israeli troops from Southern Lebanon in accordance with
Security Council resolution 425, fully and without conditions.
</P>
<P>
"The Minister informed me that the withdrawal will occur in '
one go' by the end of July," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
 "The Minister assured me of his Government's intention to
cooperate fully with the United Nations throughout the process,
within the framework of the relevant Security Council resolutions,
" the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"The Minister and I agreed that cooperation by all parties
concerned would be needed in order to avoid any deterioration of
the situation during the withdrawal," Annan added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has pledged to end Israel's
occupation of the "security zone" in southern Lebanon by July with
or without a peace deal with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Annan said Monday in New York "If the withdrawal comes outside
a broader agreement, obviously it is not an ideal situation. We
will have to cope with it."

<HEADLINE> Hundreds of U.S. Employees Rally For PNTR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 500 employees of
American corporations from around the United States joined
together here Tuesday to urge members of Congress to extend
permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) to China.
</P>
<P>
The employees, representing large and small businesses in the
telecommunications, aerospace, insurance, manufacturing, airline
and service industries, began their lobbying campaign with a rally
at the Commerce Department and then went to Capitol to meet with
Congressmen to advocate PNTR.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, speaking at the
rally, said the Congress vote on PNTR this year is "one of the
most profound and important decisions America will make in this
decade".
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky said support for PNTR on Capitol Hill is growing in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
"This is a tough vote for many members, but we are optimistic
that we will succeed in achieving permanent normal trade relations
status for China," she said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summars, speaking on the same
occasion, said the vote will make American workers and businesses
to benefit from the trade deal reached between the U.S. and China
in November last year.
</P>
<P>
"It can be a landmark in the United States embrace of an
economic strategy based on working to take advantage of the global
economy, a strategy that's brought us the lowest unemployment and
the highest productivity in a generation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rally was sponsored by the Business Coalition for U.S.-
China Trade, consisting of more than 1,200 leading American
companies, trade associations and farm organizations that support
PNTR.
</P>
<P>
Ruth Harkin, Senior Vice President of United Technologies
Corporation who is speaking on behalf of the business coalition,
said that it's Americans who will reap the benefits when the doors
fling open to a market of 1.3 billion people.
</P>
<P>
"Extending NTR permanently will nearly double U.S. exports to
China, raise farmers' foreign sales by 2.2 billion dollars each
year and create thousands of new, high-wage American jobs like the
200,000 that already support trade with China," she said. "The
deal is just too good to pass up."

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Tuesday appointed Razali Ismail of Malaysia as his
special Envoy for Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Annan expressed the hope that Razali Ismail would be able to

tenure.
</P>
<P>
Razali was active in a variety of areas and distinguished
himself by taking an active role in the preparation of the United

playing an exemplary leadership role as the president of the fifty-
first session of the General Assembly.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Threatens to Sue Mexico for Unfair Telecom Practices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government on Tuesday
accused Mexico and several other nations of erecting unfair
barriers to keep American telecommunication companies out of their
markets.
</P>
<P>
The administration set deadlines for later this year for the
barriers to be removed and raised the prospect that cases would be
brought to the World Trade Organization (WTO) if the most
objectionable barriers are not dealt with.
</P>
<P>
"We will follow up to ensure that expected actions are taken on
a timely basis and that those actions are consistent with WTO
commitments," U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said
in statement, after concluding an annual review of major U.S.
trading partners and their compliance with WTO telecom rules.
</P>
<P>
The others named in the annual review of telecommunication
practices were Germany, South Africa, Britain, Canada, Peru,
Israel and Taiwan Province of China.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Clinton administration issued a separate report
accusing Japan of violating its WTO commitments by refusing to
lower high interconnection fees that U.S. telecommunication
companies complain are designed to keep them out of the Japanese
market.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the United States singled out Mexico for attack,
accusing authorities of failing to open a telecommunications
market dominated by Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), the former
Mexican state phone monopoly.
</P>
<P>
Mexican long-distance operators affiliated with U.S.-based AT&AMP;T
and MCI WorldCom have struggled for years to compete with Telmex,
and have put pressure on the Clinton administration to take action.
</P>
<P>
"In Mexico, it appears that progress towards a level playing
field for telecommunications carriers now is stalled," Barshefsky
said.
</P>
<P>
She said the United States would decide by July 28 whether to
take action against Mexico, its partner in the North American Free
Trade Agreement. The administration also had set a deadline of
July 28 for resolving the Japanese case.
</P>
<P>
Other review deadlines set by the administration Tuesday
included June 15 for Germany, South Africa and Britain, and
October 2 for Canada and Peru.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the administration said it would also be watching
to see that Israel lives up to commitments to terminate
objectionable telephone barriers by the end of 2001, and to see
that Taiwan carries forward with the elimination of certain
exclusive licensing arrangements.

UNITED NATIONS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Tuesday welcomed a decision by the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation to offer a grant of 57 million U.S. dollars to help
four African countries in their anti-AIDS efforts.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Annan said, "I most profoundly
welcome the decision of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to
provide a grant of 57 million U.S. dollars to strengthen efforts
to protect young people in Botswana, Ghana, Uganda and the United
Republic of Tanzania."
</P>
<P>
"This extremely generous action will contribute immeasurably
to the efforts of African countries to control the spread of HIV/
AIDS," the statement said. "It also sets an example that I call on
other partners to emulate."
</P>
<P>
"It should give the international community a gentle nudge
towards meeting the target of significantly reducing HIV
infections in young people in the most-affected countries by the
year 2005 -- a target set at last year's General Assembly special
session on the implementation of the Program of Action of the
International Conference on Population and Development," the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Africa's southern and eastern region is home to more than 50
percent of those living with HIV and accounts for 60 percent of
all AIDS deaths so far.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges EU to Help Settle African Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania Tuesday urged the
European Union to support Africa in its efforts to take the
leading role and initiative in dealing with conflicts in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
In his intervention on the political issues agenda distributed
to delegates attending the Africa-Europe Summit being held in
Cairo, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa said Europe must support
African initiatives to end its conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"In most African countries facing conflict situations,
everything else we are discussing here fades into insignificance
if people are not sure if they will be alive tomorrow," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa noted that the socio-economic disruption brought about by
 conflicts will not only affect the country, but also its
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
He cited the example of Tanzania with its influx of refugees
from the conflict-torn neighboring countries such as Burundi and
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Mkapa urged the summit to support in deeds and action the
ongoing efforts in Tanzania's north town of Arusha to facilitate a
framework for sustainable peace in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
He further urged the EU to support politically and materially
the implementation of the Lusaka peace accord on the DRC conflict.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urges Britain to Compensate for Land Seizure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Justice, Legal and
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa said on Tuesday
the British government should compensate for white farmers whose
land would be seized for black resettlement.
</P>
<P>
Mnangagwa, who is also the leader of the House, made the
remarks during a second reading of the Constitution of Zimbabwe
Amendment Bill.
</P>
<P>
The Bill sought to amend the constitution with regard to the
compulsory acquisition of land and to provide for the
establishment and functions of the Anti-Corruption Commission.
</P>
<P>
The minister said: "We have provided for the mechanism for the
British government to pay compensation through a fund to be
established for that purpose."
</P>
<P>
"But on the other hand if the British government fails to pay
compensation, then the Zimbabwean government has no obligation to
the farmers whose land would be compulsorily acquired for
resettlement," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution amendment intended to close the gap on the
land imbalances since 1890 when the British government and
subsequent white governments pushed the blacks of this country to
communal lands which were marginal rainfall areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We count ourselves lucky that after 110 years of land denial,
today we are poised to make history by enacting a piece of
legislation that will put to rest the constraint to correct the
land deprivation to our people by the colonial past," he added.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Makes Last-Ditch Efforts for Extension of President's Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
said that the ruling coalition leaders will continue to push for
the extension of President Suleyman Demirel's term in office,
despite objections from the opposition and some coalition deputies.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit made the remarks in a written statement on Monday after
meeting his coalition partners, Nationalist Movement Party (MHP)
leader and Deputy Prime Minister Devlet Bahceli, and Motherland
Party (ANAP) Chairman Mesut Yilmaz, Turkish Daily News reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit was astonished and upset in the first round of vote last
Wednesday when only 303 deputies from the 550-member parliament
voted for his proposal which would reduce the president's term from
seven to five years, but allow for a second five-year term.
</P>
<P>
The "yes" votes were far short not only of the required minimum
of 330 votes for an amendment to be legislated, but also of the 406
votes Ecevit was promised to gain from the ruling coalition and the
opposition True Path Party (DYP).
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that 324 deputies of the ruling parties and 82
deputies from the DYP who signed the constitutional amendment
package should stick to their pledge and vote for the changes in
the second and the final round of vote on Wednesday (tomorrow).
</P>
<P>
This is important for the credibility and prestige of
Parliament, he said, adding that the coalition leaders would take
the necessary measures to ensure that their deputies would vote for
the amendment.
</P>
<P>
The first round result showed that most ANAP deputies are
against Demirel's extension in office and, to make things worse,
quite a few DYP deputies joined the forces against Demirel who just
came from this party.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, who felt betrayed, said Monday that in view of the fact
that deputies will cast their ballots in secret, he cannot ensure
that the amendment will get enough "yes" votes namely two-thirds
majority.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that Ecevit wants the bill passed to avoid
squabbling in the ruling coalition over the select of a successor
to Demirel. However, many deputies clearly believe it is time for
the 75-year-old leader to step aside from politics.
</P>
<P>
Public support for the extension of Demirel's presidential term
has been in steady decline since January, a poll conducted by the
Ankara Social Researches Center (ANAR) revealed on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Among those who reject the extension of Demirel's presidency,
59.5 percent say it is because of his age, and 16.7 percent believe
that a new person should be given the opportunity to take the
presidential post.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the passage of the amendment package in the
final vote on Wednesday, depends on Ecevit' efforts to bring
renegade coalition deputies back in line or strike a bargain with
the main opposition Islamist Virtue Party (FP).
</P>
<P>
The FP, founded at the ashes of the banned fundamentalist
Welfare Party in 1998 and embroiled in a closure case, insisted
that they will vote against the bill unless it is appended with a
legislation that would reduce the danger of their party's ban by
the constitutional court in coming weeks.

<HEADLINE> New Commander of Israel Air Force Assumes Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Major General Dan Halutz
officially became the 14th commander of the Israel Air Force (IAF)
in a ceremony at the Tel Nof air base Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Halutz, 52, deputy commander before the promotion, replaced
Major General Eitan Ben-Eliahu, according to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
As a promising commander, with shot-downs of two Migs and a
helicopter to his credit, Halutz joined the force in 1966 and
quickly implemented flight actions with then advanced F-4 fighters
during the War of Attrition with Israel's Arab neighbors in the
late 1960s and early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
After the Yom Kippur war broke out in 1973, he abandoned his
plan to study and went into battle, flying at least 43 combat
sorties during the time.
</P>
<P>
He went on as F-16 pilot, weapon systems head, and commander of
Hatzor airbase. In 1998, he was promoted to major general and
appointed to the General Staff as head of the IAF Operations
Directorate, the deputy post in the force.
</P>
<P>
He had good professional relations with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak as they cooperated well when Barak was Chief of General
Staff of Israel Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
Halutz spoke highly of his predecessor during the office-taking
ceremony for Ben-Eliahu's contribution to the IAF in the past four
years,
</P>
<P>
Ben-Eliahu took his final flight in a fighter jet last Friday to
wind up his over-4500-flight-hour career and announced his retiring
from the service.
</P>
<P>
Some military experts pointed out the 56-year-old outgoing
commander had done many things to revive the IAF, which is
drastically different from the one he took over four years ago.
</P>
<P>
His early period on the job was overshadowed by the worst
accident in IAF's history when two transport Choppers ran into
head-to-head, killing all 72 soldiers they were ferrying to Lebanon
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
But later, he achieved many of his goals: sending two Israeli
astronauts to train with U.S. counterparts in a NASA (National
Aeronautics and Space Administration) base, improving IAF's long-
range transporting and attacking capability, opening the once
closed cooperation with foreign air forces, introducing a
Helicopter Air Division, and so on.

<HEADLINE> 2 Iraqi Civilians Killed in U.S., British Air Raids  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Two civilians were killed and a
number of people injured in U.S. and British warplanes' attacks in
southern and northern Iraq on Tuesday, an Iraqi military spokesman
announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 12:50 (0950GMT), 16 formations of U.
S. and British planes made 38 armed sorties from Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait, bombing civilian and service facilities in the southern
provinces of Basra, Misan, Thi-Qar, Qadissiyah, Wasit, Muthana and
Najaf, killing two and injuring an unspecified number of people.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that at 10:05 (0705GMT), nine hostile
formations of the U.S. and British planes made 18 armed sorties
over the northern provinces of Dohuk, Neiveva and Erbil from
Turkish airspace.
</P>
<P>
On both occasions, Iraqi air defense artillery fired at the
enemy planes, forcing them to flee back to their bases.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched the four-night air strikes
against Iraq in December 1998, their warplanes have made a total of
20112 armed sorties over the two no-fly zones in southern and
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led Western
coalition following the 1991 Gulf War, with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has never recognized the restricted zones for no explicit
authorization from the U.N. Security Council.

Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat said the Palestinian-Israeli final
status talks were still in a preliminary stage.
</P>
<P>
"None of the main topics has been resolved so far," he told
reporters after meeting visiting Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev at his presidential office in the West Bank city of
Ramallah on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We reached no solution of any of the main issues, namely
Jerusalem, refugees, settlements, water and borders," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not ask for the impossible, rather we want sincere and
accurate implementation of the signed accords," he added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting with the Kazakh leader covered the latest
developments of the Middle East peace process and the bilateral
relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat hailed Kazakhstan's efforts to push forward the peace
process and its long-standing support for the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nazarbayev said Kazakhstan understood the rights of
the Palestinian people to establish an independent state.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh leader appreciated Arafat's role in the Palestinian
issue, saying "your heroic role is highly appreciated worldwide and
we hope for reaching a final settlement of the question."
</P>
<P>
All the concerned parties should abide by the U.N. Security
Council resolutions to help the peace process succeed and reach its
targets, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Foreign Minister Erlan Idrisov and other senior
officials, the Kazakh leader arrived in Ramallah Tuesday morning on
a state visit to Palestine.

<HEADLINE> Arab-Israeli Water Talks Cancelled, Says Omani Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MUSCAT, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Arab-Israeli talks on water
resources, due to be held in Muscat on April 11-12, have been
cancelled as Oman would not act as a host due to its obligations to
the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
An Omani foreign ministry source said his country has not
invited member countries of the working group on water under the
multilateral negotiations, which include Israel, to hold such
talks.
</P>
<P>
A multilateral meeting in Moscow on February 1 scheduled the
talks on water resources in Muscat.
</P>
<P>
The source said Oman has to respect Arab League resolutions on
the peace process, referring to call by the pan-Arab body on March
11 on member states to review ties with Israel and to "reconsider"
their participation in the multilateral talks until "tangible"
progress has been made on all tracks of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked since January
due to the two sides' differences over the Golan Heights. Syria has
demanded full Israeli withdrawal from the plateau, but Israel wants
to keep part of the area adjacent to Lake Tiberias which is crucial
to its water security.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in Moscow also scheduled talks on regional economic
development in Amman on May 8-11, on Palestinian refugees from May
16-18 in Ottawa, and on May 31-June 1 in Tunis on the environment.

<P>
GENEVA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel will withdraw troops from
south Lebanon as scheduled in accordance with UN Security Council
Resolution 425, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan
announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the end of his meeting with Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy, Annan said, "The minister reaffirmed
his government's decision to withdraw Israeli troops from southern
Lebanon in accordance with Security Council resolution 425, fully
and without conditions."

<P>
Annan said that Levy had informed him that the withdrawal would
occur in "one go" by the end of July. But he added that he was
looking forward to a formal notification from the Israeli
government on this matter.
</P>
<P>
"The minister assured me of his government's intention to
cooperate fully with the United Nations throughout the process,
within the framework of the relevant Security Council resolutions,
" the UN chief said, adding he welcomed these assurances.
</P>
<P>
"The minister and I agreed that cooperation by all parties
concerned would be needed in order to avoid any deterioration of
the situation during the withdrawal," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Leading Indicators Fall In February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Composite Index of Leading
Economic Indicators in the United States fell 0.3 percent in
February, following a strong performance in the previous three
months, the Conference Board said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Board, a prominent research group, said the index fell to
106 in February from 106.3 in January.
</P>
<P>
"Signals for the immediate future point to continued expansion,
although not at the breakneck pace of the fourth quarter of 1999,"
said the Board's economist Ken Goldstein. The U.S. economy grew at
7.3 percent annual rate in the final quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Goldstein said "The biggest risk to the ongoing expansion
continues to be interest-rate increases and the prospect of still
more Federal Reserve Board action."
"The data now suggest some sectors are beginning to respond to
Federal tightening, but certainly not enough to prevent the
economy from reaching new records for longevity," he added.
</P>
<P>
The composite indexes are the key elements in an analytic
system designed to signal peaks and troughs in the business cycle
in the next three to six months. The U.S. economy is in the 109th
consecutive month of expansion, surpassing the record of 106 month
expansion in 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said, eight of the ten indicators that
make up the leading index declined in February. The most
significant decreases are interest rate spread, building permits,
and new orders for nondefense capital goods.

ATHENS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The registered voters in Greece
are 8,976,135, of which 4,593,955 are women and 4,382,180 are men,
the Macedonian Press Agency (MPA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Greece's parliamentary elections, the 10th since the
restoration of democracy in the country in 1974, will be held on
April 9 with the participation of 26 political parties, including
the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) and the main
opposition New Democracy (ND).
</P>
<P>
Currently, a total of 18,959 polling stations have been
erected throughout Greece, and the ruling PASOK-led by incumbent
Prime Minister Costas Simitis is expected to win the forthcoming
elections although it will be a close contest for the country's
two largest political parties.
</P>
<P>
On March 14, Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos dissolved
the parliament, signalling the official start of the country's
elections campaign.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Progress Against Poverty Calls for New Empowering Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. poverty report said
Tuesday that the world's poverty agenda remains adrift, and it
needs new focus and fresh approaches that are concentrated more on
governance and empowering people and less on social welfare.
</P>
<P>
"Old-school prescriptions of supplementing rapid growth with
social welfare and safety nets have proved inadequate," the report
authors said at a press conference here to introduce the report,
launched here Tuesday by the United Nations Development Program (
UNDP).
</P>
<P>
The report, "Overcoming Human Poverty: UNDP Poverty Report
2000," finds that five years after the commitments of World Social
Summit for Social Development, nations with genuine action plans
to end poverty, remain in the minority.
</P>
<P>
While over three-quarters of the world's poorer nations have
estimated the dimensions of poverty in their midst, fewer than one-
third have set targets for eradicating extreme poverty or
substantially reducing overall poverty.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the wealthy donor countries have not backed up
their pro-poor rhetoric; they have been cutting back on aid and
failing to focus what remains on reducing poverty. They are
committed to debt relief, but not to helping poorer countries
trade more to pay off their debts.
</P>
<P>
"Much remains to be learned about how to make anti-poverty
plans effective," the authors said. Plans need to be comprehensive
-- based on much more than a few targeted projects.
</P>
<P>
Backed by funds and effective organization, a national plan
puts poverty on the public agenda. "A plan is evidence of a
national commitment and of an explicit allocation of resources to
the task," they said. "It is also a means to build a constituency
for change. Without such organized public action, market-driven
economies rarely promote social justice."
</P>
<P>
The report said, "Many donors still do not make poverty
reduction a priority, or know how to focus their resources on the
poor, or monitor their impact."
</P>
<P>
In the forward to the report, UNDP Administrator Mark Brown
stressed that "We should aim to help build up the capacities of
governments, at both national and local levels, to assume control
and direct their own poverty initiatives. This is the vitally
important capacity-building agenda for external assistance."

<HEADLINE> Gel Protect Rats' Hair Loss From Chemotherapy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The gel, a compound code-named GW8510, was developed by Stephen
Davis and his colleagues at Glaxo Wellcome. Lab tests on rats
showed it is safe and carries no side effects.
</P>
<P>
In the experiments, scientists gave rats a chemotherapy drug.
Without using the gel, 90 percent of the rats had hair loss.
GW8510 prevented hair loss totally in half of the rats.
</P>
<P>
The clear ointment works by inhibiting an enzyme that
stimulates cell divisions and thus temporarily stopping hair
follicles from dividing. As a result, the follicles are shielded
from the effects of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
Davis described the research at a meeting of the American
Association for Cancer Research in San Francisco this week.
</P>
<P>
He said that if further testing on human holds up, patients
would rub the gel into their hair before getting cancer treatment
and then wash it out a few hours later. Davis said it is not
absorbed into blood stream in rat trials.

</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General urges all Haitians to refrain from any
further acts of violence.

<HEADLINE> German President Apologized for Nazi Atrocities in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting German President Johannes
Rau Tuesday apologized indirectly for the atrocities committed by
the Nazi occupation forces in Greece during the Second World War,
saying that he felt deep sorrow and shame.
</P>
<P>
Rau, along with his Greek counterpart Costis Stephanopoulos,
Tuesday visited the town of Kalavrita in southern Greece and laid
a wreath at the monument of the Greeks killed in 1943.
</P>
<P>
In one of the worst wartime massacres in Greece, the Nazi
occupation forces burned all the houses in Kalavrita and executed
1,436 males over the age of 15 on December 13, 1943.
</P>
<P>
The German president said that he came in Kalavrita to keep
the memory of this event alive in Germany.
</P>
<P>
"Here, at this place, I feel immense grief and shame, and only
one who knows and accepts his past can find the path to a better
future," said Rau, who arrived in Athens Monday for a three-day
official visit.
</P>
<P>
Early Tuesday, Rau also met with Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis in Athens and both sides described the relations between
the two countries as very good and positive, particularly in the
economic sector.
</P>
<P>
The German president will end his visit Wednesday and fly to
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Reports "Miss Link" in Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNTIED NATIONS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A new U.N. Development
Program (UNDP) poverty report Tuesday said that good economic
policies and growth are not enough for poverty reduction, and the
"miss link" between poverty and its reduction in scores of
developing countries and economies in transition is effective
governance institutions.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the main conclusions of "Overcoming Human
Poverty: UNDP Poverty Report 2000," a global report on human
deprivation and policies to reduce it. The report was launched
here Tuesday by UNDP.
</P>
<P>
The authors told a press conference here that even when a
country gets its poverty reduction policies right, "inept or
unresponsive governance can nullify the impact."
</P>
<P>
"When governments are unaccountable or corrupt, poverty
reduction programs have little success in targeting benefits," the
authors said. "The poor cannot gain a hearing for their views from
undemocratic and authoritarian political regimes."
</P>
<P>
"They cannot gain access to public services from an
unresponsive central bureaucracy -- or know that the services
exist if they lack information," the authors said.
</P>
<P>
The report maintains that the "bottom-line" requirement for
reducing poverty in any country is to have a government that is
accountable to people. It adds, however, that democracy alone is
not a "vaccination" against poverty.
</P>
<P>
The report argues for the decentralization of power to
municipal and community levels, but adds that holding government
officials accountable is a key function for civil society
organizations, ranging from community self-help groups to trade
unions and political parties.
</P>
<P>
"Without the continuous pressure of popular organizations,
democracy can be locked up and carted away with the ballot boxes
after each election," the report said.
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, the authors said, rooting out poverty
requires that the "non-poor" give their support to the campaign,
but, most important, that the poor be sufficiently organized to
demand.
</P>
<P>
The report is rich in examples. They cover: anti-corruption
efforts in countries from Thailand to Uganda, to Bolivia and
Georgia, democratization through use of the Internet to share
information in Egypt, Jamaica, Mongolia and Ukraine, and the
decentralization of government power to communities in Ghana,
Kyrgyzstan, Morocco and Nepal.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in Belgium
went down in March as compared with a year ago, local television
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
RTBF, the radio and television service for the French-speaking
community of the country, said that the jobless dropped by 7
percent in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
It added that the jobless rate went down by 15 percent in the
country's Flemish-speaking part while the same rate decreased by 3.
5 percent in the French-speaking part.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat, the statistical bureau of the European Union,reported
on Tuesday that the unemployment rate for Belgium in February was
8.6 percent, 0.1 percent down as against a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Though the unemployment kept on dropping in the country,Belgium
still remains within the top five of the 15-nation bloc as
unemployment is concerned.
</P>
<P>
The highest unemployment rate in the European Union was found
in Spain where it was 15.2 percent in February, followed by Italy,
Finland and France.
</P>

<HEADLINE> World Bank: Growth Prospects for Developing World Look Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The average growth rate for
developing countries is likely to reach 4.6 percent in 2000, up
from 3.3 percent last year, and climb slightly to 4.8 percent in
2001-2002, as their economies start to recover from the 1997-98
global financial crisis, according to a new World Bank report
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said that not all developing countries will
benefit equally in this recovery, which has been fuelled by
stronger than anticipated growth in industrial countries, an
exceptionally strong recovery in global trade, and higher
commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
Global Development Finance 2000, the World Bank's yearly report
on external financing prospects for developing and transition
countries, said that a much larger number of these countries will
record positive per capita growth in 2000 than in 1998/99.
</P>
<P>
But it warned that some 41 low-income countries, with a
combined population of more than 1 billion people, will barely
cross the threshold into positive growth. This underscores the
still fragile path of reform and recovery that lies ahead for
these countries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Developing countries are finally starting to recover from the
worst impact of the global crisis, but this recovery is uneven,"
said Uri Dadush, director of the World Bank's Prospects Group that
produces the annual Global Development Finance.
</P>
<P>
The report said net long-term flows from international capital
markets, including bank lending, bonds and portfolio equity flows,
to developing countries as a group fell in 1999 to levels last
seen in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
For the next few years, a gradual recovery is expected in such
capital markets flows, with gross flows rising from about 161
billion dollars in 1999 to around 185 billion dollars in 2000, and
to between 220-230 billion dollars in 2001. This would represent a
recovery to levels seen in 1995, but well below the extraordinary
levels experienced during the speculative bubble of 1996 and 1997,
in the run-up to the outbreak of the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the report found that foreign direct investment
flows, which remained resilient during the crisis, have become the
single-largest and most stable source of long-term development
finance for developing countries. These flows have jumped from 35
billion U.S. dollars in 1991 to 131 billion dollars in 1996 and
192 billion dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"It's time to reflect on the lessons of the crisis to better
protect the world economy in the future. One strong conclusion is
that we have to take steps therefore to reduce the downside of
capital volatility," said Dadush.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Voices Concerns Over Refugees' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on Tuesday voiced concern over
the "arbitrary" arrests of refugees as part of the national
police anti-crime operations.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR said in a statement that treating refugees as
criminals violated the basic principles of international law.
</P>
<P>
The detentions also violated asylum seekers' rights to
protection and assistance in South Africa, it said.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, the South African police have rounded up
 thousands of suspects involved in various crimes in a nationwide
crackdown on crimes. Press reports said many refugees from
neighboring countries were among those arrested.
</P>
<P>
"While the zeal with which this cleaning up operation is to be
admired and is indeed supported from many quarters, it is also a
violation of the basic principles of international law that
genuine asylum seekers and refugees have been rounded up with
criminal elements and treated as such," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR worked closely with the South African government to
draft terms of references to process asylum applications but more
needs to be done to ensure that junior officials and security
personnel be cognizant of refugees' rights, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
While the government played an exemplary role in assisting
South Africa' s neighbors in times of trouble, this example had to
be emulated by South African nationals, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The country must be seen to be practising what it preaches on
the continent as well as ensuring that civil servants, in
particular, are instrumental in upholding human rights in their
interaction with non- nationals," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday afternoon the office of the Gauteng Provincial
Commissioner reacted in a statement, saying a program to educate
members about protection of refugees was in place.
</P>
<P>
Police spokeswoman Henriette Bester said booklets and posters
had been distributed to all police stations and workshops "to
educate members" would be held throughout the province.
</P>
<P>
"Where abuses come to the attention of the police, it will be
investigated," said Bester.
</P>
<P>
"It needs to be mentioned that a number of illegal immigrants
arrested were in possession of false documentation," she added.

<HEADLINE> Former Ethiopian Deputy PM Sued Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Justice Ministry
has lodged a civil charge against former deputy prime minister and
minister of defense Tamirat Layene, Ethiopian News Agency reported
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry sued Tamirat and his accomplices for illegally
selling 1, 000 tons of coffee worth 34 million birr (about four
million U.S. dollars) under the pretext of paying the country's
debts.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the Federal High Court has ordered inquiry
into the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
Tamirat was sentenced in mid-March to 18 years imprisonment and
fined 15, 000 birr (1,800 dollars) after being convicted of
corruption and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
Tamirat was prime minister between 1991 and 1994 following the
overthrow of Mengistu Haile Mariam. He became deputy prime
minister and defense minister in 1995 when Meles Zenawi was named
prime minister under a new federal constitution.
</P>
<P>
Tamirat was sacked in October 1997 and has been in detention
since then.

<HEADLINE> S.Africans to Observe Three Planets Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africans have a rare
opportunity to see the planets Jupiter, Saturn and Mars together
shortly after sunset on Thursday, the South African Astronomical
Observatory said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Viewers looking toward the northwestern horizon will see
Jupiter, the brightest of the three planets, directly below the
moon, and Mars slightly below and to the right of Jupiter, the
observatory said in a statement, adding that Saturn will be to the
right of the moon.
</P>
<P>
The best time to spot the planets will be between 20 and 30
minutes after sunset.
</P>
<P>
"All three planets and the moon will be quite low in the sky
even then. By an hour and a half after sunset, they'll be below
the horizon. If you wait too long, you'll miss the show," the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Plans to Sell 28 Tons of Ivory to Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Over 28 tons of ivory from
South Africa's Kruger National Park could soon be on its way to
Japan, South African Tourism and Environment Minister Valli Moosa
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which will be worth about 30 million rand (about five
million U.S. dollars), now depends on international acceptance of
a controversial South African proposal to allow a restricted sale
of the world-renowned game park's ivory stockpile.
</P>
<P>
The proposal will be presented by Moosa to the 11th conference
of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES) in Nairobi, Kenya during April 10-20.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a media briefing in Cape Town, Moosa said South
Africa's position on the sale of ivory is "very carefully
considered" and its proposal is modest.
</P>
<P>
"We are not interested in opening up a free trade in ivory. We
would be very concerned if you could walk down a street in Cape
Town or Johannesburg and purchase an elephant tusk."
</P>
<P>
South Africa is a very strong supporter and proponent of CITES
and will not be in favor of elephants being killed for their
ivory, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, South Africa's proposal has sparked strong protest
from some environmental pressure groups, which claimed that
illegal elephant poaching has risen since 1998 when CITES
delegates voted to allow an experimental sale of ivory from
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana.

<HEADLINE> Africa-Europe Summit To be Held Every Three Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 4 (Xinhua) -- African and European Union (EU)
leaders have decided to hold a summit every three years,
ministerial meeting each year and expert meeting every six months,
a diplomatic source said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The venue for the next summit will be moved to Europe, probably
Greece, the diplomatic source added.
</P>
<P>
This is the result of two sessions of discussions at the ongoing
Africa-Europe summit in Cairo that is involving leaders from most
of the 53 African countries and the 15-member EU.
</P>
<P>
At the first such summit, which opened Monday, African leaders
have strongly urged the summit to be held on a regular basis and
proposed once every three years with ministers meeting in between.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit that will end Tuesday evening will cover a
wide range of political, economic and social development issues,
with an eye on forming a new and strategic relationship between the
two continents in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the 15 EU member states are former colonial powers in
Africa and the EU gives 15 billion U.S. dollars to Africa every
five years, more than any other single source.
</P>
<P>
Debt issue dominated the summit, with many African participating
countries putting their quest for debt reduction and cancellation
top of their lobbying.

<HEADLINE> Innovation Key to Singapore's Future: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Singaporean Prime Minister Chok
Tong Tuesday stressed that innovation is the key to his country's
future, calling upon Singaporeans to adapt themselves to the fast-
changing new economy.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the point to the Productivity 2000
Campaign Rally attended by some 1,000 CEOs, union leaders,
representatives from employer association and productivity
activists.
</P>
<P>
Goh said the technological advances have accelerated the pace
and scale of change in the new era and the rapid spread of
knowledge has sped up the creation of new products and services
and the development of sophisticated production process.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the size of a country and distance to market are no
longer insurmountable constraints as a result of globalization, he
said a company that only looks to local suppliers for raw
materials and sells only to local customers will languish.
</P>
<P>
Winning companies look to the world market to source for the
best materials and talents, produce where it is cheapest and sell
where the demand is, he added.
</P>
<P>
Goh said through the history of mankind, countries and
corporations able to respond and adapt to changes quickly have
triumphed over others while those that failed to act and react
quickly fell by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
Goh said there is no way for Singapore to compete with labor-
abundant countries on the basis of wage costs and the only
solution for his country is to produce goods and services of a
better quality through innovation.
</P>
<P>
"The spirit of innovation must permeate every level and every
sphere of our activities", Goh said, adding the Productivity
Movement will be becoming the Productivity and Innovation Movement
with emphasis on promoting and spreading innovation and value
creation to all sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's Productivity Movement was first launched in 1981
with the aim to raise productivity in every economic area and
quality of products made in the city state.

<HEADLINE> Robertson, Albright Stress Close Ties with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Lord
Robertson and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stressed
on Tuesday that NATO is resuming close ties with Russia under the
leadership of President-elect Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference following a meeting here,
Robertson called Russia a "strategic partner" with which NATO will
discuss common security problems.
</P>
<P>
The two met to prepare for NATO's meeting next month in Florence,
Italy. Robertson said European allies are assuming some of the
burden that has been carried disproportionally by the United
States in dealing with security problems in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between NATO and Moscow has been deteriorating
since the alliance conducted a 78-day air campaign against
Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Russia's Security Council approved a new
doctrine in February but it will not be published until an amended
version has been signed by President-elect Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
The published draft doctrine says that Russia will use all
possible means, including nuclear weapons to ward off a foreign
aggression.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Wesley Clark, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in
Europe, said that the new doctrine, which upgrades the role of
nuclear weapons, was a step in the wrong direction and should be
revised.

here Tuesday.
</P>

Wars and conflicts are raging in 14 of the 53 African countries,
leaving 8 million people as refugees and further worsening the
already fragile economic situation in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The OAU official also said that the EU countries agreed to

<P>
He said that positive results have been produced in the
extensive consultations at the two-day summit, which is being

CAIRO, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo

burden of debt in African countries for mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the first Africa-Europe summit in Cairo, Obasanjo

"We do not ask for charity," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We seek debt relief and remission. We seek mutually beneficial
investment. We seek fairer terms of international trade. We insist
that Africa is not perpetually relegated to being a dumping ground
for sub-standard goods coming from Europe or anywhere else," he
said.
</P>
<P>
African countries have pressed for the EU countries'
cancellation or rescheduling of their debt, but the countries have
refused to discuss the details of the issue at the ongoing summit.

ANKARA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Provincial Directorate of
Security in Ankara has uncovered a new illegal pro-fundamentalist
organization named Jihad.
</P>
<P>
Security officials said Tuesday two extremists drove into the

can, reported the Anatolia News Agency on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two men were injured afterward when a bomb exploded
accidentally in their own car. They rushed to a hospital for
treatment, saying they injured themselves while cutting meat.
Suspicious, the doctors reported to hospital security guards who
called the anti-terrorism police.
</P>
<P>
During initial interrogation, the two men confessed their crime
and surrendered leaflets cursing "damned with secular infidels."
</P>
<P>
The security officials revealed that the extremists were members
of a new illegal organization named Jihad.
</P>
<P>
A total of 18 Jihad members had been arrested in operations
carried out by anti-terrorism police against their hideouts in the
Kecioren and Balgat Districts.
</P>
<P>
Three pistols, pipe-bombs and floppy discs were discovered in
the hideouts.
</P>
<P>
The security officials said Jihad was founded by those who
detected from other illegal pro-fundamentalist organizations such
as the Islamic Great Eastern Raiders-Front (IBDA-C), the Vasat and
the Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Jihad aims to establish a state based on the Islamic religious
Sharia Law, according to the officials.
</P>

The Fabless Semiconductor Association, a group of 240 chip
companies that don't own their own factories, expects demand for
chip wafers, the underlying materials from which chips are made,
to increase 39 percent in 2000 and 48 percent in 2001.

growth of the Internet and cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
Contract chip makers are therefore more than doubling their
capacity expansions this year. About 54 percent of fabless company
sales are expected to be a communications-related this year,
compared with about 27 percent for the personal computer.

JOHANNESBURG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The floods which have ravaged
large parts of South Africa since January have cost the country
about 2.2 billion rand (about 360 million U.S. dollars) in damage
to infrastructure, South African Press Association reported on

PARIS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- France expressed its optimism
Tuesday over a truce in southern Lebanon between Israel and the
Hezbollah guerrillas in near future following several months of

<HEADLINE> Fair Competition Stressed for Advertising Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China has stepped up efforts to
combat irregularities involving advertisements released through
various channels, to promote fair competition in this booming
sector.
</P>
<P>
China's advertising industry has registered double-digit
growth in annual turnover for two consecutive years, earning 62.2
billion yuan in 1999 alone, sources at the State Administration of
Industry and Commerce (SAIC) said.
</P>
<P>
The number of advertising firms has been surging since 1992,
and had reached 36,000 by the end of 1999. Other advertising units
include TV stations, radio stations, newspapers and magazines.
Currently, some 58,000 people are working in the sector.
</P>
<P>
However, illegal practices, including fake advertisements, have
cropped up. China handled 51,494 advertisement malpractice cases
in 1999, up 36.6 percent from 1998. Fake advertisement accounted
for some 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
"China enacted its Advertisement Law in 1995, and since then a
number of rampant illegalities have been effectively curbed, such
as fake tobacco ads" said Wang Jinjie, a SAIC official in charge
of advertisement supervision.
</P>
<P>
"However, the proportion of fake drugs, medical service and
food advertisements has been increasing rapidly, now accounting
for the lion's share of all fake ads," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the surge mainly to the emergence of new media
channels and new marketing patterns, such as the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"This has made supervision more difficult, as there is yet no
specific law to regulate these new ads," Wang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The SAIC is drafting new regulations to monitor advertisement
contents and new marketing activities, especially Internet ads and
TV ads, according to Wang.

<HEADLINE> China Drafting Action Plan to Clean Polluted Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Wang Jirong, vice director of the State
Environmental Protection Administration of China (SEPA), the SEPA
is formulating the plan following a recent joint investigation of
the pollution situation in the Bohai sea by central and local
government departments as well as the Chinese Navy.
</P>
<P>
A special report on the investigation's findings was submitted
to the central government by the provinces of Liaoning, Hebei and
Shandong and the coastal city of Tianjin (which are all located on
the Bohai Rim), the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of
Agriculture, the Chinese Navy, and the State Maritime
Administration of China.
</P>
<P>
The Bohai Sea covers 77,000 sq km, and an annual discharge of 3.
8 billion tons of waste water, much of it untreated, into it has
resulted in a serious deterioration of the water there during the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
The waste water has caused frequent red tides and rapid
depletion of the Bohai fish stocks.
</P>
<P>
Less than 40 percent of waste water is treated in urban China,
and a growing number of cities are building sewage treatment
plants with or without overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reduce land-based industrial pollutants in areas
surrounding the Bohai Sea began last year.

<HEADLINE> Iran Assures Fair Trial of Jews, Rejects Foreign Meddling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran said on Tuesday that its
judiciary will handle independently the case of Jews arrested on
spy charges and it is opposed to any foreign intervention in the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi told reporters that
any pressure from any countries will be rejected in order that the
accused can get a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to remarks by a French counterpart, who said
Paris and its European partners would follow the case with great
care, in addition to repeatedly announcing their great concern.
</P>
<P>
The 13 Jews, arrested last year along with eight Muslims, were
charged with spying for the United State and Israel, both of whom
denied any link with them. They will face the death penalty if
found guilty.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said the trial is a domestic issue, and any intervention
and prejudgment regarding the case should be rejected, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The policy of Iran is based on securing rights of all citizens,
and judicial officials have assured that the rights of Iranian Jews
will be respected during the legal proceedings, Asefi said.
</P>
<P>
The accused will be dealt with fairly, he said. Three of the 13
charged are currently free on bail.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Justice said on Monday that the trial, due to
start on April 13, could be postponed. "If the lawyers of the 13
accused needed more time to prepare their defense, the court would
grant the request," a ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The trial is to take place in one of the revolutionary courts,
which hear all national security cases. It can be an open trial or
behind closed doors, with the judge deciding the nature of the
trial.
</P>
<P>
The case has attracted international attention, while Iranian
authorities, including President Mohammed Khatami, have insisted
they receive a fair trial and warned other countries against "
interfering" in Iran's affairs.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Revive Talks on Importing Egypt Natural Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Minister of National
Infrastructure Eli Suissa is scheduled to meet Egyptian officials
in Cairo next week to revive talks on the purchase of natural gas
from Egypt, a ministry official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although he had not made a final decision on the import, Suissa
expressed his inclination to accede to Egyptians' requests in
recent weeks, the official revealed without elaborating on those
requests.
</P>
<P>
The project has been discussed over the past six years, under
which Egypt would sell natural gas to Jerusalem by extending its "
pipeline of peace" into Israeli territories.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline is currently being constructed from the Nile Delta
to El Arish in the Sinai Peninsula, some 25 kilometers from Israel
borderlines. It is designed to provide gas to the Palestinian self-
rule areas, Jordan and in the future possibly to Lebanon, Syria and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Israeli talks on the project are contingent upon
the progress of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
As part of the Camp David peace accord signed with Egypt in
1979, Israel is allowed to import 2 million tons of oil from Egypt.
In the past three years, however, the imports were reduced for "
commercial reasons," or the chill in bilateral relations during the
reign of former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin government.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Egyptian government finally agreed to sell
natural gas to Israel, a decision coming shortly after the Israeli-
Syrian peace talks were resumed.
</P>
<P>
But the commercial negotiations proceeded very slowly and were
temporarily frozen by Suissa last month, as his ministry officials
referred to the Egyptians as "not being serious negotiators" by
making exorbitant requests and intentional delay.
</P>
<P>
Israeli oil companies, which had announced a series of initial
gas discoveries off Israeli waters near Ashdod and Ashkelon, two
coastal towns south of Tel Aviv, have been lobbying extensively
against the gas import.
</P>
<P>
Three recent drillings there indicate that Israel can meet its
own natural gas needs for the next 15 years, thus there is no need
for the Egyptian gas anymore, according to these companies.
</P>
<P>
They launched a campaign in recent months to press the
government to halt negotiations with Egypt, saying the import could
deal a severe blow to local gas-exploration industry and harm
national interests.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts disagreed, however, saying that it is still too
early to determine the amount of natural gas that those areas can
provide and any additional suppliers would be welcome.
</P>
<P>
Amit Mor, director of a leading Israeli consulting group on
energy and environmental issues, said that more suppliers would
only enhance competition and reduce gas prices, which have a direct
effect on economic development.
</P>
<P>
To echo Mor's views, the Ha'aretz daily reported on Tuesday that
Suissa's decision on resuming the negotiations with Egypt has sent
a signal to Israeli gas providers that their exclusivity is not
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian officials were quoted recently as saying that natural
gas reserves in Egypt could amount to 120 trillion cubic feet
(about 3.24 trillion cubic meters), enough to meet the country's
domestic needs for 100 years.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts say importing natural gas, a cleaner and
cheaper fuel than oil or coal, from Egypt would save Israel 150
million U.S. dollars annually as compared to any viable
alternative.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Calls Africa-Europe Summit Important, Urges Joint Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 4 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Tuesday termed the ongoing Africa-Europe summit as "important"
while urging joint development in economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said at a press conference on the sidelines of the
Africa-Europe summit that "the summit is important when assessing
the results" because it enabled the Europe to better understand
Africa and African leaders to speak and meet with European
officials.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state or government, or their representatives from most
of 53 African states and the 15 European Union members are
participating in the two-day summit.
</P>
<P>
The first and biggest gathering between Africa and Europe under
the aegis of the Organization of African Unity and the EU opened
Monday in Cairo International Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
On African debt issue that dominated the summit, Chirac,
acknowledging debt is a "drawback and hindrance to development,"
stressed that debt reduction should be beneficial to both debtors
and creditors.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the most indebted poor African states will
take priority in debt forgiveness and the medium-income countries
should pay back, at least part of their debts.
</P>
<P>
Outcries for debt reduction or cancellation from the EU, the
major creditor of Africa, are strong among the African leaders at
the summit. The African countries are spending 23 billion dollars,
or 30.9 percent of their exports, every year to service the
staggering 350 billion dollars of debts.
</P>
<P>
France Monday announced to cancel debts of the poorest countries
within one or two years. Germany and Morocco also decided to make
contributions to the African debt relief.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, he also criticized the so-called Afro-
pessimists," saying they do not know the reality of Africa and
their ideas are "misleading and wrong" and are "one tree hides the
whole forest."
</P>
<P>
He said that Africa has achieved a 5 percent economic growth,
surpassing its demographic growth, and there are increased
democracy and real progress in good governance there.
</P>
<P>
He urged French investors to go on to invest in Africa, not to
be influenced by those "Afro-pessimists."
</P>
<P>
France, the former colonial power in Africa, has close
relationship with Africa, especially the French-speaking African
countries. The Franco-African summit between France and French
speaking African countries is held on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
On globalization, Chirac urged control of its negative effect,
promoting the development of poor countries and avoiding
marginalizing them.

<HEADLINE> Philippine House Speaker Hails Latest Survey Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine House Speaker Manuel
Villar said Tuesday that the latest Social Weather Stations (SWS)
survey results showed the improved perceptions of the Estrada
administration.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the House of Representatives told reporters that
the results should inspire concerned parties to further improve
their quality of service to Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
However, Villar admitted that there is still much work to be
done, stressing the ultimate gauge of their success "is in how we
will make a positive difference in the lives of Filipinos."
</P>
<P>
The latest SWS survey showed President Joseph Estrada with a
positive 5 approval rating, indicating the president has recovered
some degree of public confidence.
</P>
<P>
It was definitely better than the negative 13 percent rating he
supposedly got in a less comprehensive survey conducted by a
pollster in February.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey results released Monday, 43 percent
were satisfied with Estrada's performance, compared with the 44
percent in December.
</P>
<P>
The president's approval ratings were stable in Metro Manila,
from negative 2 percent in last December to a positive 1 percent
in March and from positive 5 percent to positive 4 percent in
Luzon.
</P>
<P>
There was a slight decline in the Visayas, from positive 1
percent to negative 8 percent, but it was offset by an increase in
Mindanao,from positive 14 percent to positive 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The SWS' first quarter survey was undertaken on March 4 to 22
and covered 2,400 respondents.
</P>
<P>
As this developed, an opposition House member on Tuesday urged
the president's critics to give Estrada a chance to "prove his
worth."
</P>
<P>
"Resignation is much too drastic considering that the President
has only been in office for less than 2 years. Let us, in the
meantime,grant President Estrada's wish for more time to improve
his performance..." Rep. Gerardo Espina said.

policemen are regaining the trust of the public," Estrada said.

both drunk at the time, fired indiscriminately at customers inside
a karaoke bar in Victoria, Mindoro.

<HEADLINE> Chad Criticizes Elf for Withdrawing From Oil Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Chadian President Idriss Deby said
Tuesday that his country was greatly disappointed when the French
oil group Elf-Aquitaine decided to withdraw from an oil
exploration project in the country last year.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French daily Le Figaro, Deby said that
the decision by Elf to withdraw from the oil exploration project
in Doba was made a few days before the World Bank was due to
decide whether to finance the project.
</P>
<P>
"The withdrawal by Elf has put the project in peril," said Deby.
</P>
<P>
He said he felt betrayed by Elf because he had personally
helped the oil group enter the project, which was under strong
competition of several international oil corporations including
Exxon and Shell.
</P>
<P>
"I protected the interests of a friend," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Deby said that the declaration by Chad that the French
ambassador in N'djamena, Alain du Boispean, was "persona non grata
" had nothing to do with the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
He also said that France is still welcome in his country and
the friendship between France and Chad is "solid."

<HEADLINE> Fair Promotes Cooperation between East And West China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China opened a high-profile trade
fair today in this capital of Shaanxi Province, in northwest China,
to step up cooperation between its prosperous eastern region and
poor western region.
</P>
<P>
The fair is the largest event to be held since Premier Zhu
Rongji announced the strategy of developing the western region at
the Third Session of the Ninth National People's Congress this
March. The move is expected to increase consumer demand and
realize all-round development.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the State Economic and Trade Commission and other
central ministries and commissions, as well as 15 major
municipalities, provinces and autonomous regions, the fair aims to
attract investment and technology to the vast western region,
which largely lags behind the other parts of the country in
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The fair has 3,500 sq m of floor space to demonstrate the
potential of the western region and how eastern cities can profit
from joining in the development of the west.
</P>
<P>
The fields of cooperation range from automobiles and energy to
machinery and high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
The fair has attracted companies from more than 20 foreign
countries, including leading transnationals such as IBM, Philips
and Siemens.
</P>
<P>
The annual fair was first launched in 1997, but ended with
small transaction volumes. Experts estimate the current one will
start a real investment rush.

efforts to develop its good-neighborly and friendly relations with
Vietnam, according to Chinese top legislator Li Peng here today.

<HEADLINE> No One Against Israel's Withdrawal: Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 4 (Xinhua) -- No one in Lebanon disapproves
Israeli troop withdrawal from south Lebanon, said a senior leader
of the Lebanese Hezbollah guerillas on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sheik Naim Qassem, deputy secretary general of Hezbollah, or
Party of God, described Israel's planned complete withdrawal by
July as a victory for Lebanon's resistance movement and Palestinian
cause, the People's Voice radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on what the Israeli government claimed "Lebanon's
reluctance to Israel's withdrawal," the Hezbollah leader said that
it reflected the Jewish state's fearfulness in which they have
lived all along.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-styled 15-kilometer-deep security zone
in south Lebanon in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its
northern border from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet on March 5 passed Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's plan to pullout its troops from south Lebanon with or
without framework agreement with Lebanon and Syria, the main power
broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian- and Syrian- backed Hezbollah is spearheading a war
of attrition against Israel's occupation in south Lebanon. It has
repeatedly reiterated that the guerrilla will not cease fire until
Israel withdraws completely from the occupied land.

<HEADLINE> French President Terms Africa-Europe Summit as " Important" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 4 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Tuesday hailed the Africa-Europe summit as an important event,
saying through the meeting Europe better understood Africa and
African leaders got an opportunity to speak and meet with European
officials.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the remarks at a press conference Tuesday on the
fringe of the first Africa-Europe summit that befalls on Monday and
Tuesday and was attended by heads of state or government, or their
representatives from most of the 53 African states and the 15-
member European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Chirac said he only "partly agrees with analysis that the summit
is superficial," and he thinks "it is important when assessing the
results."
</P>
<P>
On African debt issue that dominated the summit, Chirac,
acknowledging debt is a "drawback and hindrance to development,"
stressed that debt reduction should be beneficial to both debtors
and creditors.
</P>
<P>
Outcries for debt reduction or cancellation from the EU, the
major creditor of Africa, are strong among the African leaders at
the summit. The total debts have reached 350 billion U.S. dollars
in 1999 and the African countries are spending 23 billion dollars,
or 30.9 percent of their exports, every year to service the debts.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said Monday night that France will cancel debts of the
poorest countries within one or two years.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama also announced Monday
night that Germany and Morocco will make contributions to the
African debt relief.
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's press conference, Chirac urged other European
states to follow the lead on debt issue.
</P>
<P>
But he also noted the debt forgiveness or reduction should be
carried out in a process of gradualness. The poorer and most
indebted countries will take the priority and the medium-income
states should pay back or at least repay part of their debts, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Cabinet Reshuffle Expected Next Week: Thai PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will conduct a
minor cabinet reshuffle next week, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chuan told reporters after a weekly cabinet meeting that he had
personally discussed a cabinet reshuffle with leaders of the
ruling coalition parties.
</P>
<P>
He asked all coalition parties to consider changes in their
cabinet members only if necessary, as his Democrat Party will only
look for qualified candidates to replace Sanan Kachornprasart for
the posts of deputy prime minister and interior minister.
</P>
<P>
Sanan resigned from the two portfolios after the National
Counter Corruption Commission indicted him last week for
falsifying his assets and debts record.
</P>
<P>
The case is waiting for a final ruling of the Constitutional
Court.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said that he expected to complete the cabinet reshuffle
before the Songkran festival, which officially starts on April 13
and ends on April 15.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition must call an election of the House of
Representatives by November.

<P>
The warning system will cover six key disasters, including
drought, flood, storm, forest fire, plant epidemics and animal
epidemics.
</P>

<HEADLINE> EU Urged to Invest More in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki Tuesday urged the European Union (EU) to invest more in the
African continent.
</P>
<P>
The African continent needs "ample supplies" of capital to
provide for infrastructure, industrialization and modernization,
said Mbeki while addressing delegates from 15 European and 52
African nations attending a two-day European Union-Africa summit
in Cairo, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"We seek the agreement of our European friends that
extraordinary measures will have to be taken to encourage larger
foreign direct investment inflows into Africa," he was quoted as
saying by South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
He said that in many African countries, progress has been made
in areas that are important for the creation of a climate
conducive to foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
These include trade liberalization, the strengthening of the
rule of law, improvements in legal and other instruments, as well
as the telecommunications and transport infrastructure, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mbeki, foreign direct investment is crucial to
Africa's economic growth and development, but Africa's share of
foreign direct investment among developing countries declined from
more than 11 percent during the period of 1976-1980 to four
percent in 1996-1997.

</P>
<P>
"I am appealing to the Political Committee and the parties here
present to assure their responsibilities so that effective
cessation of hostilities and disengagement of forces on the ground
is achieved," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said the people in the DRC should be relied on for their
political will and resolve in the implementation of the Lusaka
cease-fire agreement inked by all parties to the 19-month-long
armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
According to Kazembe, "the sixth plenary session of the JMC is

million in March 1997, 17 million in May 1998 and 16 million in
March 1999.
</P>
<P>
The figures are seasonally-adjusted in line with criteria of
the International Labor Organization.

Meanwhile, the EU as a whole recorded a jobless rate of 8.8
percent in February, the same as a month earlier. The rate in
February 1999 was 9.5 percent.

meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
"When fielded, the missile system will update Egypt's air
defense system by replacing an older Russian-made missile, the SAM-
6," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived here on Monday from Israel for a two-day visit and
left after for Jordan after the meeting with Mubarak. He will also
visit Persian Gulf states in his annual Mideast tour.
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon statement said the missiles can be launched from a
mobile unit on the ground and is intended to improve Egypt's short-
range air defense capability.
</P>
<P>
It would also help complement U.S. capability and enhance
Egypt's ability to participate in future combined force operations,
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the two sides still have to work out details of the
sale, including timing of delivery. "In terms of what it will cost,
that is too early to say at this point," he said.
</P>
<P>
When he visited Cairo in March 1999, Cohen announced plans to
sell Egypt 3.2 billion U.S. dollars of military hardware, including
24 F-16 warplanes, 200 M-1A1 tanks and 32 Patriot-3 missiles.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila Backs Estrada Amid Coup Rumors by Pan Jiaxu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Manila Mayor Lito Atienza on
Tuesday voiced solid support to President Joseph Estrada and his
administration amid a domestic political wave to undermine his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
Atienza expressed his position by signing a manifesto
supporting the administration of Estrada, whom reports said has
been the "subject of mudslinging or character assassination."
</P>
<P>
Atienza, along with other city leaders including councilors,
community heads and congressmen who signed the manifesto, said the
spate of attacks against the presidency could slow down the
country's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"We are calling on our constituents and all concerned citizens
to speak up in the defense of what the people truly want -- an
opportunity to be economically productive without being subjected
to a daily dose of propaganda to discredit the president and the
presidency," he said.
</P>
<P>
Propaganda efforts to undermine the presidency in particular
and the government in general, Atienza said, could only benefit
few --armed organized groups and those with a political agenda.
</P>
<P>
Recently, rumors of a coup are back, abetted by groups calling
for the resignation of President Estrada.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Philippine Senate's minority leader Terofidto
Guingona urged President Estrada to resign before the nation
plunged into "more protests, more convulsions and possible chaos."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reports said former Commissioner of the National
Telecommunication Commission Linggoy Alcuaz was also spearheading
a campaign calling for the resignation of Estrada.
</P>
<P>
According to Alcuaz, he has close links with the Reform of the
Armed Forces Movement which launched six failed coup attempts
against the Aquino government from 1986 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an amorphous group of "concerned" citizens launched
Monday a "silent protest," whose symbol is a white, slanted
exclamation mark against a black background.
</P>
<P>
The protesters were complaining of what they called the "
disappointing governance" of the Estrada administration, alleging
that the government has been hit by "corruption, cronyism and the
failure to eradicate poverty."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the presidential palace accused the camp of
former President Fidel Ramos of orchestrating the campaign to
topple the Estrada administration.
</P>
<P>
A ranking official of the Defense Department alleged that
officials of the Ramos administration had joined forces with the"
silent protest" movement in denouncing the government.
</P>
<P>
However, Estrada's supporters pointed out that two years is too
short a period for deciding that a president must be replaced,
adding that Estrada has a constitutionally guaranteed tenure of
four more years.
</P>
<P>
According to Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon, foreign
diplomats here did not express interest in the coup rumors.
</P>
<P>
"They have been able to read through the lines in the
Philippine news press. They know that some headlines are made to
sell newspapers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the military is reportedly solid behind President
Estrada.
</P>
<P>
"The military is solid behind the president. The military is
solid behind the constitution and the constitutionally-elected
authorities,"Deputy Chief of Staff Jose Calimlim of the Armed
Forces of the Philippines said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
To the presidential palace's relief, results of a quarterly
survey issued Monday by the Social Weather Station showed that
Estrada's nationwide approval rating did not drop to the negative
level but remained at 5 percent, the same level as last December.
</P>
<P>
However, earlier last month, some reports quoted results of
less comprehensive surveys as saying Estrada's rating had dropped
to the negative. Such reports had added up to the negative impact
on the image of the president.
</P>
<P>
The results of the Social Weather Station, a nationwide
pollster,are deemed here as a more comprehensive and accurate
gauge of the people's sentiment.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Formulates Governance Framework for Insurance Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's central bank (Bank
Negara) is formulating a framework of good corporate governance
for the insurance industry, the bank's Assistant Governor Zamani
Abdul Ghani said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The framework in line with the government's effort to nurture
good governance practices in the corporate sector will embody
several of the principal and best practices dealing with the
duties and responsibilities of directors as spelt out in the
Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance, he said here at a two-day
conference on corporate governance.
</P>
<P>
He said the framework would establish basic principles of good
corporate governance in other key organizational aspects of
insurance operations including management accountability,
corporate independence, internal controls, operational risk
management, public accountability and financial and management
reporting.
</P>
<P>
He said sound corporate governance is important for broadening
and deepening local capital markets by attracting domestic
institutional and individual investors apart from long-term
foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
In addition, good corporate governance practices are now
becoming a necessity for every country and business enterprise and
no longer restricted to the activities of public-listed
corporations in advanced economies, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zamani said the financial crisis that hit the East Asian
economies has highlighted the importance of good corporate
governance and best business practices to many countries in this
region.
</P>
<P>
There is a growing recognition that good corporate governance
is essential to protecting the interests of investors,
shareholders, bankers and insurers and the public at large, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent volatility and instability experienced by
emerging markets highlighted weak management practices and poor
control and governance on the part of the board of directors,
which in turn contributed to the financial collapse of many large
companies.
</P>
<P>
The practice of good corporate governance demands a sense of
conviction and commitment from the board of directors and senior
management to ensure that the interests of all parties are
protected, he added.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Leader Returns From Southeast Asia Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Chief Executive General
Pervez Musharraf Tuesday described his week-long visit to five
Southeast Asian countries as "very useful."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on his return here, Musharraf said he had
held useful talks with leaders of the visited countries, including
Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia,Brunei and Thailand, "in an
atmosphere of traditional eastern cordiality."
</P>
<P>
These talks, he stated, were "amiable and constructive,
reflective of a mutual desire to enhance cooperation."
</P>
<P>
The chief executive said the objective of his visit was"to
reaffirm and reinvigorate the bilateral relations and to brief the
leaders on the current security environment in South Asia and the
necessity of an early resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
"
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said he also discussed with the leaders of these
countries "ways and means to expand economic and trade cooperation.
"
</P>
<P>
The visit occurred soon after a brief trip by U.S. President
Bill Clinton to Pakistan and is believed to be aimed at the wider
acknowledgment of Musharraf's military-led government which
assumed power last October in a bloodless coup.
</P>
<P>
During the five-nation visit, the chief executive was
accompanied by a minimum number of entourage and travelled by
regular commercial flights as part of his government's austerity
campaign, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Angola-IMF Accord to Benefit Angolan Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The accord means a start of the new cooperation between Angola
and the IMF, which followed the bitter memory of the aborted
monitored accord signed in 1998 due to the recrudescence of the
civil war.
</P>
<P>
According to the Angolan financial authorities, with the aim to
 stabilize and relaunch the economy, the two sides signed the
accord, following a series of negotiations resumed last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the program will help improve the country's
external credibility, its institutional capacity and create
conditions for the development of the national economy.  The
accord also include the improvement of the living standard of the
Angolan population, reshuffle of the country's external debt and
the access to loans for funding its economic and social
development under advantageous terms.
</P>
<P>
According to the Angolan finance minister Joaquim David and
the head of the IMF's African and Middle East division Paulo, the
accord is valid until December of this year.
</P>
<P>
David said that the program, which was drafted by the Angolan
government in 1999 with the aim to rescue the country from the
economic and social crisis, has served as a basis for the
negotiations with the world financial body.
</P>
<P>
The IMF representative said the negotiations with the Angolan
authorities have been very productive.
</P>
<P>
The measures contained in the package are very demanding in
terms of transparency in the state's accounts and the like.
</P>
<P>
The accomplishment of the program is expected to create
conditions for the Angolan government to get access to another
accord called ESAF (Reinforced Structural Adjustment Facility).
</P>
<P>
The ESAF comprises two important components. The first includes
an IMF funding under good terms, while the second provides for
access to the country's external debt reshuffling. During the
visit to Angola, the IMF delegation also reviewed with the
government on inflation, exchange and interest rates, the
country's external debt, the budgetary performance in the coming
two months and the government's public investment program.
</P>
<P>
After 25 years of civil war, Angola is facing grave economic
and humanitarian crisis. Most Angolans living in the central
highland left their hometowns for fleeing the rampant military
conflicts, with most of their industry shutdown and arable lands
deserted.
</P>
<P>
As the second-largest oil-producing country in the African
continent, Angola's economy is now solely depending on exporting
crude oil to western countries.
</P>
<P>
The country has good natural conditions for the agricultural
production. But in 1999, the country had to import some 500,000
tons of aliments. After winning a upper hand in the battle fields,
the government is determined to make use of the abundant natural
resources and develop its own manufacture and agriculture, which
need much funds and equipments for the kick-off of the industrial
and the agricultural programs.
</P>
<P>
But local analysts said that the signing of the accord does
not mean the start of the acquirement of international investment
and assistance. The Angolan government's economic policies have to
accept the review of the IMF delegation.
</P>
<P>
The so-called reform plan for the aid-receiving countries made
by the IMF was accused by some aid-receivers of being arbitrary
and unpractical.

<HEADLINE> Obuchi's Cabinet Resigns, Mori Expected to Be Successor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi's cabinet resigned en masse Tuesday evening to pave the way
for Obuchi's successor to form a new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Yoshiro Mori, secretary general and the No. 2 figure of Japan's
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), is most likely to succeed
Obuchi as party leader and hence Japanese prime minister,
political sources said.
</P>
<P>
At 7 p.m. (1000 GMT) the cabinet convened an emergency session
at which all ministers resigned.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet's resignation, which came two days after Obuchi
collapsed due to a stroke, is based on Article 70 of the Japanese
Constitution, which states that all cabinet members must resign
when there is a vacancy in the post of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Acting Prime Minister Mikio Aoki, who
concurrently serves as chief cabinet secretary, said, "We cannot
allow a political vacuum to continue."
</P>
<P>
A senior LDP official said Obuchi's successor is likely to be
picked at plenary sessions of both chambers of Japan's Diet (
parliament) to begin at 1 p.m. (0400 GMT) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prior to that, the official said, the LDP will hold a meeting
of its lawmakers in both houses of parliament at 10:30 a.m. (0130
GMT) Wednesday to choose Obuchi's successor as LDP president.
</P>
<P>
The LDP president entails the Japanese premiership as ruling
camp enjoys an overwhelming majority in the powerful House of
Representatives (lower house).
</P>
<P>
LDP sources said most of the cabinet ministers, including Aoki
in the capacity of chief cabinet secretary, are likely to be
retained under the new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi remained in a coma Tuesday afternoon, breathing only
with the help of a respirator, Aoki told a press conference after
visiting the Tokyo hospital where Obuchi is staying.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, 62, is not brain-dead, Aoki added.

PARIS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The current success of English clubs
in European cup competitions owed largely to the contribution of
foreign players, Liverpool's French manager Gerard Houllier told
French daily l'Equipe.
</P>

Stam, (Mark) Bosnich or even (Raimond) Van der Gouw is very
important," Houllier added.
</P>
<P>

Alex) Ferguson has great experience of Europe, the same of course
as (Arsene) Wenger at Arsenal and (Gianluca) Vialli at Chelsea,"
he said.
</P>

European champions Manchester United and Chelsea are in the
Champions League quarter-finals while UEFA Cup semi-finals saw
Arsenal and Leeds United qualified.

<HEADLINE> Coulthard Loses Appeal against Disqualification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- McLaren's British driver David
Coulthard has lost an appeal against his disqualification from
second place at last month's Brazilian grand prix.
</P>
<P>
Motor racing's world governing body International Automobile
Federation (FIA) said here on Tuesday its appeal body "decided to
confirm the stewards' decision pronouncing the exclusion of car
number two (Coulthard's) from the classification of the 2000
Brazilian Grand Prix".
</P>
<P>
Coulthard was disqualified by stewards at Interlagos nine days
ago because his McLaren broke technical regulations relating to
front-wing end planes. The stewards ruled the front wing was two
millimeters out of tolerance.
</P>
<P>
In a statement the FIA said Monday's meeting of its appeal body
had decided the distance between the planes exceeded the tolerance
allowed under FIA regulations, and it was up to the teams to
ensure their cars conformed.
</P>
<P>
McLaren had argued the infringement was caused by the bumpy
track at Interlagos but the FIA said this argument was "unfounded".
</P>
<P>
" ... all the competitors - including the appellant - had been
subjected to the rigors of the circuit in question from the first
practice session onwards, and ... all steps could thus have been
taken to make the necessary adjustments to the cars to allow them
to cope with these difficulties," it said.
</P>
<P>
Citing FIA rules, the statement said "it is the duty of each
competitor to prove that his car complies with the regulations in
their entirety at all times during an event."
</P>
<P>
The FIA ruling left the McLaren team, Formula One's top team
the last two seasons, without a point after the first two races of
the F-1 season, in either the drivers' or constructors' standings.
</P>
<P>
The F-1 season continues with the San Marino Grand Prix at
Imola in Italy this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The court of appeals was comprised of FIA Chairman Philippe
Roberti de Winghe and judges from the Netherlands, Portugal,
Ireland and Spain.
</P>
<P>
The FIA opened its International Court of Appeal on Monday to
hear McLaren's protest over the disqualification.
</P>
<P>
In a similar case five months ago, the same FIA appeal panel
reinstated Ferrari's 1-2 finish in the Malaysian Grand Prix after
stewards ruled aerodynamic deflectors were out of compliance by
one centimeter.
</P>
<P>
At the time, McLaren's managing director Ron Dennis harshly
criticized the reversal and said the FIA had two standards.

<P>
JINAN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province, a
major grain producer, will open its agricultural sector wider to
the outside world this year.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chuntao, director of the Shandong Provincial Foreign Trade

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- On today's Qingming Festival, the
traditional Chinese day for remembering the dead, the government
of northeast China's Liaoning province declared that the province
is embarking on a serious forest fire prevention campaign.
</P>
<P>
The government firmly bans burning joss paper at cemeteries,
which is the traditional way to show respect for the dead, and
also a cause for forest fire.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand kilometers of forest-covered mountains can be
found in the eastern part of Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Related provincial departments have published bulletins and
carried out educational training programs to arouse public
awareness of preventing forest fires.
</P>
<P>
Those who smoke or burn something near flammable materials or
in no-smoking areas will be seriously punished or even detained,
according to the provincial fire department.
</P>
<P>
The province has also spent about 15,000,000 yuan (1,800,000 US
dollars) for fire-fighting equipment.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Northern States to Harmonize Sharia with Extant Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Governors of Nigeria's 19 northern
states met on Monday, resolving to constitute a panel, which would
harmonize provisions of the Islamic Sharia law with the extant
penal code.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Tuesday quoted a
communique published after their meeting in the country's
northern Kaduna state as stating that the panel would comprise
Moslem and Christian leaders.
</P>
<P>
The governors condemned the recent agitation over confederation
or national sovereignty conference by some states, and pledged
their loyalty to "the federal structure of Nigeria" and federal
government under the leadership of President Olusegun Obasanjo."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the governors said that "we have resolved to uphold
the whole north as one indivisible and geo-political entity within
the Federation of Nigeria." The population of northern Nigeria is
predominately Muslim as against the Christian south.
</P>
<P>
The governors also condemned the bloody clashes one month ago
in Kaduna and other parts of the country over the introduction of
Sharia, in which about 1,000 people died.
</P>
<P>
They said they were contended with a statement by the
Conference of the State at the end of the Kaduna crisis that
Sharia provisions had already existed in the country's
constitution.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Emirs, Ulamas and other traditional rulers in
the north also started their meeting in Kaduna on the same topic.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A minor cabinet reshuffle has been
announced in Nigeria with the swapping of Information Minister
Dapo Sarumi and the Minister of Cooperation and Integration in
Africa Jerry Gana, said Nigerian media Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Monday in the capital Abuja by the office
of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, the swapping
of porfolios took immediate effect and the process of
handing-taking over should be completed within hours to ensure
that no vacuum is created by the changes.
</P>
<P>
The removal of Sarumi as Information Minister is widely
believed to be a first step to a mass cabinet shake-up expected
next month, one year after the inauguration of the present
government.
</P>
<P>
Gana was information minister under the former military ruler,
Ibrahim Babangida and briefly under the late Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
As new Information Minister, Gana is the chief government
spokesman to manage Nigeria's information machinery.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to his removal, Sarumi said he was not surprised at
President Olusegun Obasanjo's decision and disclosed that the
President had earlier discussed the issue with him, adding that
the redeployment was "a blessed decision" for him.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Rejects Using Eritrean Port for Relief Food: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has rejected
Eritrea's offer to use its port of Assab to deliver relief food
for Ethiopian famine victims, the Monitor newspapers reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a statement by the Ethiopian Foreign
Ministry as saying that Eritrea had looted "some 50,000 tons of
USAID-donated food grain and other relief items destined for
Ethiopia from Assab port and used it to feed its army."
</P>
<P>
Eritrea's proposal to use its port of Assab to deliver food aid
for Ethiopian drought-affected population is the "the latest
Eritrean public relations gimmick...", the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea made its proposal to Hugh Parmer, the USAID assistant
administrator for humanitarian relief during a recent meeting with
Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there are more than eight million
Ethiopians suffering from hunger.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia became a land-locked country after Eritrea declared
independence in 1993. It stopped using Eritrean ports of Assab and
Massawa following the outbreak of their border conflict in May
1998.

ADDIS ABABA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The wild fire in the Bale
region, about 250 kilometers south of Addis Ababa, has been put
out completely by earlier this week, the Ethiopian Herald
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The one-month-and-half-old fire is now completely under control
 following a fire-fighting campaign launched by more than 36,000
farmers, students and other sections of the society, the report
quoted a local official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rains of the past few days played a considerable role in
snuffing out the fire, the officials noted.
</P>
<P>
The official said 30,250 hectares of forests and coffee
plantations, 67 residential houses and some animals were
destroyed in the fire.
</P>

A total of 215 people suspected of starting the fire have been
arrested by police, he added. Before the fire in the Bale
regions was put out, the wild fire in the Borena region,
bordering with Kenya, was also snuffed out at the end of last

NICOSIA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-one people have been killed

There are 20 traffic deaths every year for every 100,000

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Committed to Change to K-Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is committed to
transforming its economy from production-based to knowledge-driven
by drafting a k-economy master plan as part of the overall plan to
enhance its international competitiveness and efficiency in order
to sustain long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
The first draft of the k-economy master plan may be completed
by the yearend, "aimed at increasing the knowledge content of the
economy as a key to moving up the value-added chain," Mustapa
Mohamed, the Finance Ministry advisor, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The master plan will be used as input into the formulation of
the 2001 budget and the Eighth Malaysia Plan (2001-2005) to
expedite the country's transformation to a knowledge-driven
economy, Mustapa, former second finance minister, said here when
opening a seminar on challenges facing Malaysia's economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
He said sustaining the recovery in the immediate term does not
present a problem as the Malaysian economy has picked up
sufficient momentum amid the relative stability of financial
markets and the encouraging world economic environment.
</P>
<P>
But, in the medium term, he added, there are a number of
potential risks and uncertainties that might impact on the
otherwise strong recovery.
</P>
<P>
Aside from recovery policies and strategies to ensure continued
growth, new sources of growth in agriculture, manufacturing and
the k-economy are being identified and strategies are being
designed to intensify their growth prospects, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is also focusing on identifying fresh strategies to
attract foreign investments and stimulate local private
investments in an overall effort to provide financial resources
necessary to sustain the recovery process.
</P>
<P>
Given the current trends in globalization and liberalization,
the Malaysian economy could not afford to take a break, Mustapa
said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the view that Malaysia's economic outlook in the
immediate term remains encouraging and barring any adverse
external developments to change the current favorable external
environment, the real gross domestic product growth is expected to
be 5.8 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia hopes the recent East Asian financial crisis
has increased the awareness of the international community and
there would be a more discernible move toward greater coordination
of policy initiatives and measures aimed at crisis prevention and
containment.

<HEADLINE> China's Housing Sector Keeps Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Massive housing construction and
increasing housing sales are spurring China's economic development
and becoming a major focus of consumer spending, said a senior
official here today.
</P>
<P>
According to Vice-Minister of Construction Song Chunhua, China
has so far maintained rational and stable real estate development
nationwide, and the real estate market with ordinary housing
construction as the main element has started to pick up.
</P>
<P>
Housing construction continues to expand and sales continue to
grow, the official added.
</P>
<P>
He said the country is launching massive housing construction,
building 410 million square meters of floor space in 1999 with
total investment topping 401 billion yuan, up 19.6 percent and 11
percent, respectively, over the 1998 figures.
</P>
<P>
The booming housing sector has revived the sluggish real estate
markets, and private buyers now account for some 80 percent of
residential buyers, and this figure is still rising.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the average per capita living space of
Chinese urban residents has grown sharply to 9.6 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, fast-growing rural economic development has brought
about a boom in rural housing construction, exceeding 600 million
square meters every year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has built three billion square
meters of rural housing over the past five years, as some five
percent of the country's total rural households built new houses
each year.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the implementation of the housing reform
nationwide, which means selling residences to citizens rather than
allocating it to them as benefits, has played an important role in
developing the housing market.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate individual spending on living quarters, the
commercial banks have launched mortgage-loan services for home
buyers Meanwhile, a housing fund-raising system targeted at
helping buyers has been effectively instituted nationwide.

<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin will
concentrate on bilateral relations when he meets Egyptian
President Muhammed Hosni Mubarak, and it is natural that the two
leaders will also talk about the Middle East peace process, said
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi here today.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question concerning President Jiang's April
visit during which Jiang is expected to hold talks with President

the peace process will take a flexible, practical and serious
approach toward the negotiations on the basis of relevant U.N.
resolutions and the principle of Land for Peace.
</P>
<P>
China will make due efforts as a permanent member of the U.N.
Security Council to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The peace negotiations now face historical opportunities;
however, it goes without saying that difficulties will crop up
with the further development of the negotiations, said the
spokesman.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at the Chinese Academy
of Sciences (CAS) have used a gene-removal technology to discover
a gene related to a common respiratory disease found among newly-
born babies.
</P>
<P>
A research group at the Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology
under the CAS removed the NDST-1 gene from laboratory mice, and
after this gene was removed the mice developed the syndromes of
this respiratory distress.
</P>
<P>
Respiratory distress is a common disease among human new-borns,
and genetic studies of the mice will help scientists find cures
for this disease.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time gene-removal technology was used in
China, and it was successful after more than a year of effort by
researchers at the institute. They are now seeking further funds
to unite with foreign organizations and carry out advanced studies
in this field.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Faced with a barrage of attacks following reports that with
the impasse with Syria he can now turn his attention to economic
issues, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Monday strongly denied
that his economic policies have failed.
</P>
<P>
"We're working in all areas all the time, and there's nothing
new in wanting to simultaneously wave the flags of both the
diplomatic-security and socio-economic issues," Barak said during a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
Responding to his critics, Barak also listed what he views as
his government's economic and welfare achievements and programs to
be advanced in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and the French government
are working to adjust Security Council Resolution 425 in order to
clarify the terms of a deployment of international peacekeeping
forces in south Lebanon after the Israeli troops withdraw from the
region.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy will meet Tuesday in Geneva
with Annan and present the Israeli government's decision to pull
out of Lebanon this July. Levy will tell the U.N. secretary general
that the withdrawal will comply with Resolution 425, passed in
March 1978.
</P>
<P>
Prior to leaving for Switzerland, Levy met on Monday with U.S.
and French ambassadors to Israel, Martin Indyk and Jacques
Hunzinger. The discussion focused on alternatives for the
deployment of an international force in southern Lebanon after an
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) pullout.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- South Lebanon Army (SLA) commander General Antoine Lahad
vowed Monday that his men would choose to "die on their own land,"
as Jewish partisans did at Masada, rather than live in Israel as
refugees.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a hilltop fortress in the Judean desert
where Jewish rebels and their families resisted Roman soldiers for
years. When they saw the Romans were about to breach their
defenses, 960 people killed themselves rather than surrender in 73
A.D.
</P>
<P>
Lahad said that the Israeli-trained and armed militia will
continue to operate even after the IDF pulls out of south Lebanon.
It was the first time that the SLA commander has specifically said
that it would remain a fighting force after an Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Labor Party Secretary-General Ra'anan Cohen has been
officially invited to visit Libya by the top Libyan delegate to the
Inter-parliamentary convention on security and cooperation of
Mediterranean Countries, now meeting in Marseilles.
</P>
<P>
"He invited me to visit his country," Cohen said. "They believe
that the (Israeli) government headed by Ehud Barak is one...that
will bring changes and peace to the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Israel's Channel One reported Monday night that Libya denied
there was an official invitation extended to Cohen. However, Cohen
told Israel media that he stands by his story.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Uneasy Over U.S. Use of Cluster Bombs in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkey feels uneasy over the secret
use by U.S. forces of cluster bombs against Iraqi troops over the
so-called no-fly zone in northern Iraq, Turkish Daily News reported
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. action has been discovered by Turkish military
intelligence, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Turkish and U.S. military authorities have been holding talks to
address the sensitive issue of using cluster bombs against Iraqi
forces during their reconnaissance flights in the U.S.-Britain-
imposed no-fly zone north of the 36th parallel over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Under the rules of engagement agreed upon between Turkey and the
United States last year, the U.S. should inform Turkey of the
nature of the mission which U.S. warplanes carried on each flight
taking off from the NATO Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey to
monitor the no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. fighter jets began to use cluster bombs in
question last September and continued to do so unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
The code-named Operation Northern Watch (ONW) based at Incirlik
is composed of Turkish, U.S. and British forces conducting
surveillance flights in the region to deter Iraqi forces from what
the U.S. claimed attacking Kurds living in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a NATO member and also Iraq's neighbor, does not take
part in the reconnaissance flights over northern Iraq. But Turkish
pilots join in Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft flights
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The nature of arms deployed on a single U.S. F-16 aircraft
during flights over northern Iraq has always been an issue of
discontent between the U.S. and Turkey. Turkey classifies cluster
bombs as offensive weapons and has asked the U.S. not to use them
against Iraqi forces.
</P>
<P>
Turkey used to maintain close economic and trade ties with Iraq
before the 1991 Gulf war triggered by Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. The U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq since 1990 have caused
Turkey billions of U.S. dollars in losses.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Turkey supports lifting or largely easing
the sanctions, but its maneuverability is very limited. On one side
there is the U.S., which is a strategic partner and on the other
side is Iraq, which is Turkey's neighbor and a potentially vital
trading partner.

<HEADLINE> Europe, U.S. Urged to Push for Cyprus Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
has urged Europe and the United States to renew efforts to push for
a Cyprus solution, Cyprus News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Europe and the U.S. will have to consider what will happen if
Turkish Cypriot side continues to insist on the creation of two
separate "states" in Cyprus during the third round of the U.N.-
sponsored talks on Cyprus, Clerides said in New York on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Clerides left here for New York on Sunday to attend the opening
of the new Cypriot Galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
During the five-day visit he was scheduled to have meetings with
officials from various countries dealing with the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Clerides told the press Monday after arrival that no one can
predict what stance the Turkish Cypriot side will maintain during
the next round of talks.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Greek Cypriot side is not concerned about
whether the talks will be proximity or direct, but whether the
other side is willing to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
"We have no new evidence on what stance the Turkish side will
maintain during the next round of the talks," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been trying for years to bring the two
sides back together through a bizonal, bicommunal federation
formula, but no tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash insists on the recognition
of his breakaway regime in the north, now backed only by Turkey,
and a confederation of two states on the island.
</P>
<P>
The two communities have held two rounds of U.N.-sponsored
indirect talks in New York and Geneva. They will hold another round
in New York, starting May 23.
</P>
<P>
Clerides will return to Cyprus next week, and on April 10 he is
due to meet British Prime Minister Tony Blair in London.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Build More Museums </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is to
establish more museums to educate Kenyan ethnic communities on
their culture and history.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Minister Katana Ngala for Home Affairs,
Heritage and Sport at the weekend when he officially opened the
Kabarnet Museum in Baringo District, central Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Tuesday's Kenya Times newspaper as saying that
museums play an important role since they can serve as a medium of
educating Kenyans, especially the youth, on their cultural values
and in the process they can check the western cultural influence
on the young generation.
</P>
<P>
Museums will expose Kenyans to lifestyles of various ethnic
communities and how they used to co-exist peacefully in past
years, he said, adding that they would reduce any form of
animosity among the communities and harmonize their good
neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the Kabarnet Museum has tourism and
research potential because it is located in Baringo, a region
globally reputed for archaeological heritage.
</P>
<P>
According to Ngala, his ministry has set aside 800,000
shillings (some 108,000 U.S. dollars) for the construction of the
Daniel arap Moi Gallery at the Kabarnet Museum.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Raise Prices of Pyrethrum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Pyrethrum Board of Kenya will
raise buying prices of the cash crop from farmers in a bid to
encourage production since Kenya faces a deficit of 7,000 tons in
the world market.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan farmers provided 4,000 tons to the international market
in the 1998-1999 season, earning the country more than 407 million
shillings (about 5.5 million U.S. dollars). The board hoped that
the production would increase 1,300 tons to hit 5,300 tons this
year due to the hike in the buying prices.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Tuesday quoted some growers as
saying that persistent shortage of planting material and high
labor demand for weeding and harvesting are the major obstacles
for the development of the sub- sector.
</P>
<P>
The farmers also regretted that in spite of a high potential
for the crop in the east African country, which produces more than
70 percent of the world's pyrethrum, many farms lay idle for lack
of seeds.
</P>
<P>
The board has released more than 10,000 packets of seed and
cautioned farmers against being exploited by middlemen.

<HEADLINE> E. Africa Sets Giant Project to Alleviate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The East African Community
(EAC), including Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, needs a total of 9.67
billion U.S. dollars to develop two major infrastructure projects
aimed at alleviating poverty in the region, a senior EAC official
has said.
</P>
<P>
Francis Muthaura, EAC's Executive Secretary, was quoted by
local media on Tuesday as saying that the projects covering
regional road networks (nine billion U.S. dollars and
telecommunications (67 million U.S. dollars) are in the final
stages of analysis.
</P>
<P>
Muthaura said last weekend at the EAC headquarters in
Tanzania's northern town of Arusha that EAC has also planned to
develop other projects in sectors of energy, civil aviation and
shipping.
</P>
<P>
"Promotion of trade and investments, joint management and
rational utilization of shared natural resources, health,
education and development of science and technology are also on
the agenda," he told visiting David Katele, Project Coordinator of
International Council on Social Welfare (ICSW) - Africa region.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, the budgets and funds for the projects are
yet to be finalized and secured though they all have social
dimension in development aspects.
</P>
<P>
"EAC is working closely with the public and take into account
'the social dimension' including gender, the environment and
poverty eradication concerns when formulating the regional
projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is important not only to enlighten the people on their
basic needs and to remind governments of their obligations to
eradicate poverty but also that additional resources from the
development partners are necessary to move people out of the
'poverty trap'," Muthaura added.
</P>
<P>
The EAC was founded on November 30, 1999 when Kenya, Tanzania
and Uganda signed a treaty to replace the then East African
Cooperation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Falling Tea, Coffee Prices to Hit Kenya Economy: World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Price drops in coffee, tea and
other agricultural commodities in the world market will produce
trade losses for Kenya this year and worsen its economic
performance in the coming year, a World Bank report warns.
</P>
<P>
Countries heavily dependent on agricultural exports like Kenya
could suffer a decrease of more than 1.5 percentage points in
their growth rates over the next two years, the Daily Nation daily
newspaper Tuesday quoted the bank's latest survey, Global
Development Financing 2000, as saying.
</P>
<P>
A continued rise in the world oil prices would further hurt
Kenya's economy, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the report suggested that Kenya's slow-down in
economic growth resulted as much from internal factors as from
global conditions.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda's Retirement Welcomed in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Wang Nengbiao
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The retirement from active politics
by Kenneth Kaunda, Zambian former president and leader of the
biggest opposition party, the United National Independence Party
(UNIP), has been widely welcomed.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda should now be accorded the respect and status he
deserves, said Secretary General of Zambia Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) Sylvester Tembo.
</P>
<P>
The trade union leader called on old politicians to emulate
Kaunda's move and retire to pave way for upcoming politicians.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Alliance for Progress (ZAP) Chairman Ben Kapita said
that the retirement is a blessing in disguise because the former
leader will now truly be a national and international asset.
</P>
<P>
ZAP Secretary General Sylvia Masebo said Kaunda should continue
working to conclude the desire for a strong opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Voter Apathy Project executive director Bonnie Tembo said
"we would like him to be a political resource center for all
political parties in order to enhance clean and mature politics."
</P>
<P>
Zambia Independent Monitoring Team President Alfred Zulu
welcomed Kaunda' s retirement but said it should have happened a
few years ago.
</P>
<P>
UNIP cadres should not feel sad about his departure because he
had ruled the country for almost three decades and had been at the
helm of UNIP for about 40 years, Zulu said.
</P>
<P>
Zulu urged Kaunda to assist the party to identify a successor
and join the league of other statesmen who have involved
themselves in conflict resolution after retiring from active
politics.
</P>
<P>
According to Inter African Network for Human Rights executive
director Ngande Mwanajiti, the challenge now is on the Zambian
people and government to make sure Kaunda is utilized to the
maximum for the benefit of the country.
</P>
<P>
UNIP members In Ndola, in the north of the country, are now
consulting over the person they will rally behind to take over as
the party president.
</P>
<P>
Ndola district UNIP chairman James Chasaya said that the Kaunda
team, abruptly abandoned by their master, are looking for another
leader to back at the UNIP national congress to be held at the end
of this month and early May to elect new leadership of the party.
</P>
<P>
UNIP Chairman Malimba Masheke urged his supporters and those
who are for Kaunda to forget about their differences and think of
how best they will revamp the party.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, 76, reaffirmed here last Sunday his decision to quit
party politics.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda ruled Zambia after it won independence from British
colonial rule in 1964 until 1991, when he was defeated by
incumbent President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996 presidential election, Kaunda was barred from
contesting the position because of his Malawian parentage.
</P>
<P>
However, Kaunda has vowed repeatedly to run for the presidency
in the next general elections despite the government utterance
that Kaunda is not qualified for it.
</P>
<P>
His rival Chiluba has repeatedly urged him to quit party
politics to be respected as the founding father of the country
like Nyerere of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda resigned from UNIP soon after his party lost in the 1991
 elections but he returned to UNIP in 1994 and was elected UNIP
presidency in 1995.
</P>
<P>
On December 25, 1997, three days after his return from overseas
trip, Kaunda was arrested for his alleged involvement in the coup
attempt on October 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
On June 1, 1998, Kaunda was released and in return for the
release, he announced his retirement from party politics three
days later.
</P>
<P>
However, at the end of 1998, Kaunda vowed not to retire, saying
nobody can prevent him from contesting the 2001 elections.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Agreement Might be Signed in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the just ended round of peace talks in Tanzania's north
town of Arusha, all 19 Burundian delegations demonstrated their
readiness to speed up the peace process towards durable peace in
the "nearest future," reliable sources were quoted as saying in
Dar es Salaam on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The signed peace agreement could also facilitate the
possibility of Burundi to be accommodated into an enlarged East
African Community (EAC). According to the sources, a group of
journalists from Tanzania would visit Burundi any time from now to
witness the release of political prisoners and closure of
"regrouping camps."
</P>
<P>
Immediate release of political prisoners, closure of regrouping
camps which shelter an estimated 350,000 civilians so as to
isolate rebels and allowing political parties and the media to
operate freely were conditions given by international facilitator
of the Burundi conflict, ex-South African President Nelson Mandela
to President Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
Mandela took over as mediator in Burundi's peace talks in
December last year and is pushing hard a quick end to the ethnic
conflict that has cost 200,000 lives and uprooted more than 1.2
million others since 1993.

<HEADLINE> Ivanov: Chechnya Not to Be Used For Foreign Interference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said here Tuesday that Moscow would not allow the Chechen
issue to be used for foreign interference in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the breakaway republic "is too grave and
painful a problem for anyone to try to speculate on it," Ivanov
said at a meeting with U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights
Mary Robinson.
</P>
<P>
The minister accused certain foreign circles of trying to
present the federal operation in Chechnya "as a struggle against
Islam, the Chechen people and even as an action ahead of the
Russian presidential elections even without trying to understand
the roots of the problem," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side is ready "to resolve the Chechen problem
openly, in cooperation with the international community," Ivanov
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia has recently accommodated trips to the North
Caucasus for a large number of international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Robinson's trip to Dagestan, Ingushetia and Chechnya, "just as
the visits of representatives of other international organizations,
is called upon to show that we do not intend to hide anything,"
Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who arrived here last week on a working visit, had
complained that she was not able to visit all the places she
wanted, complaints refuted by Russian officials accompanying her.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Kalamanov, the Russian presidential human rights envoy
to the breakaway republic, said Monday that Russia was unable to
organize a visit to Katyr-Yurt because it had not been put on the
itinerary for her trip to the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
He described Robinson's claim as a "common lie," complaining of
her biased stance on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"As I said, it would be very difficult to restore the Chechens'
trust, but why is such mistrust is displayed by the high
commissioner?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"When we talk with Mrs. Robinson one-on-one, no problems arise.
As soon as Mrs. Robinson's suite appears, she immediately changes,
" Kalamanov said, noting that he was confused by Robinson's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
Hypocrisy as regards the issue of Chechnya must be removed in
relations between Russia and the West, Kalamanov said.
</P>
<P>
Robinson is expected to present her report on Chechnya at a U.N.
Commission for Human Rights conference on April 5.

Small coal mines, which are often improperly licensed, have

In addition, the closing down of small mines is a way of

<HEADLINE> Those Going Against People's Will Be Doomed to Failure: Commentary (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China's official news agency
Xinhua today released a commentary on the stepping down of Taiwan'
s Lee Teng-hui, noting that those going against the will of the
people will come to no good.
</P>
<P>
As a politician who was a master at playing with public opinion,
Lee has ironically lost all public support, and was forced to
announce his resignation following protests.
</P>
<P>
"It's quite natural that Lee has eventually come to a
disgraceful end," the commentary noted.
</P>
<P>
Lee has betrayed the common wishes and aspirations of people on
both sides of the Taiwan Straits for improved cross-Straits
relations, it said.
</P>
<P>
Peace, stability, and development are the common wishes of the
Taiwan people, who have called for cross-Straits dialogue and
political talks aimed at ending the hostile atmosphere on the two
sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
However, since he came to office, Lee has been bent on the
promotion of Taiwan's separation from the motherland, incessantly
challenging the principle of one China, and undermining cross-
Straits relations, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Lee also took steps to thwart the development of economic and
trade relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, while
turning a deaf ear to the call of the people of Taiwan for direct
links in trade, transportation, and postal services as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"Lee's perverse acts have aroused cries of discontent all
across the island," the commentary said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Urges to Curb HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing has urged
government officials to pay close attention to HIV/AIDS control,
noting this is vital to the future of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Li, who called a State Council meeting on prevention and
control of HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases (STD) on
Monday, said that governments and officials at all levels should
regard this work as "a strategic issue of vital importance to the
nation's fortune and state development."
</P>
<P>
Confirmed HIV/AIDS cases throughout China totaled 17,316 by the
end of last year, including 647 fully developed AIDS patients,
among whom 356 died, according to the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
But Minister of Health Zhang Wenkang noted that HIV infection
has in fact exceeded 500,000 people scattered in 31 provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions across China because most
cases are not reported.
</P>
<P>
Health experts warn that outbreak of STDs could make HIV/AIDS
control even more formidable.
</P>
<P>
The number of confirmed STD cases hit a record 836,655 last
year, a rise of 30 percent over 1998. However, estimates put the
real figure at above four million.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Li has called for the thorough implementation of a
national program of HIV/AIDS control, with the goal of keeping
China's HIV infection level under 1.5 million people by the year
2010, while ending the transmission of HIV through blood
transfusions and intravenous drug use.
</P>
<P>
It was also determined that the annual increase rate of the
incidence of STDs should be under 15 percent by 2002, compared
with from 20 to 30 percent at present.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Still Under Threat from Poaching and Trade: Report (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report, titled "Far From A Cure: The Tiger Trade Revisited,
" revealed that the trade in tiger parts in traditional Asian
medicine continues to be a threat to wild tigers, with the trade
in some markets shifting to skins and other products besides bones.
</P>
<P>
The report, made by the Trade Records Analysis of Flora and
Fauna in Commerce (TRAFFIC), a wildlife trade monitoring program
under the WWF, examines the tiger trade in the late 1990s. In
particular, it looks at the extent to which illegal trade in tiger
bones can still be considered a threat to the tiger's survival.
</P>
<P>
This report follows the highly successful TRAFFIC Report "
Killed For A Cure: A Review of the Worldwide Trade in Tiger Bone,"
which was released in 1994 and has become the leading reference
for those in the conservation community seeking to understand the
trade in tigers. Since the publication of that report, definite
progress has been seen in some aspects of controlling the trade.
But problems still exist.
</P>
<P>
"The report revealed that major illegal supplying markets still
operate openly in southeast Asian countries such as Cambodia,
Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam," said Samuel Lee, program
officer of TRAFFIC East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has a significant retail market for tiger skins,
trophies, and teeth and claws; and demand for tiger products also
appears to be high in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Indonesia, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The report praises China's efforts in clamping down on the
trade in tigers, and says the trade in tiger bones for use in
medicine appears to have decreased since a ban was implemented in
China in 1993.

<TEXT>
<P>
During his 12 years in office, Lee has talked a lot about
democracy while always acting as a self-willed dictator.
</P>
<P>
Lee has played politics in the Kuomintang Party, and his high
pressure tactics has forced many dissidents to either leave the
party or keep quite out of fear.
</P>
<P>
Under his leadership, the Kuomintang experienced one election
defeat after another as well as internal dissension. At the end,
the party was forced out of office in the last election, the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan society, Lee appeared first as a so-called "strongman
" and gradually established an authoritarian regime of personal
dictatorship, it said.
</P>
<P>
By changing the political system, Lee gathered most of the
island's power. With his connivance and support, the separatist
forces on the island grew stronger, while people in favor of
reunification were suppressed.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Lee did all he could to suppress any medium
daring to voice any criticism, and even the Western media pointed
out that Lee had actually become an emperor.
</P>
<P>
"What people see is actually the ugly face of a dictator when
Lee, the so-called Mr. Democracy, is unmasked," the commentary
noted.
</P>
<P>
The commentary stressed that politicians on the island should
draw lessons from Lee's disgraceful end, and make the right
choices that conform with the interests of the Taiwan people and
the Chinese nation as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Still Under Threat from Poaching and Trade: Report (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China now is promoting the bones of sailong, a type of mole rat,
as a substitute for tiger bones.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, China made several large seizures involving over 11
tiger skins but no bone seizures were reported.
</P>
<P>
Rob Parry-Jones, another program officer at TRAFFIC East Asia,
noted that, "These signs are positive. However, illegal trade in
tiger products into China does still continue."
</P>
<P>
Seizures of raw tiger parts suggest a shift in market demand,
and are indicative of the on-going smuggling of tiger products,
said Rob Parry-Jones, adding that while the efforts of China's
Customs officials are to be commended, increased vigilance is
needed.
</P>
<P>
The report urges the countries of origin of tigers to strictly
enforce trade bans, improve their anti-poaching capacity, develop
specialized enforcement units for undercover investigations, and
provide incentives against commercial tiger poaching.
</P>
<P>
The report also urges continued close cooperation and work with
traditional medicine practitioners. The community can play an
important role in eliminating any remaining trade, promoting the
use of substitutes, and raising conservation awareness among
consumers.
</P>
<P>
"While advances were made in the 1990s towards reducing the use
of tiger bones in traditional Asian medicines, we must not be
complacent with the successes so far," said Steven Broad,
executive director of TRAFFIC International. "Some old problems
still exist and new ones have emerged, all of which pose serious
threats to the future survival of the tiger."

<HEADLINE> IRNA Chief Summoned to Press Court over Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of the official
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) Fereydoun Verdinejad was
summoned to the conservative press court on Monday, IRNA said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The subpoena was issued after Iran's security forces filed
complaints against Verdinejad, who was required to appear in the
court within three days to present his clarification, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
However, the agency did not give more details about what the
complaints were and whether they were linked with the performance
of IRNA itself or newspapers affiliated to it.
</P>
<P>
IRNA and its newspapers, widely believed to be close to the
President Mohammad Khatami, have been under heavy attack by the
conservatives since the moderate president came to power in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives blamed IRNA and its newspapers for siding with
the reformists and thus losing their impartiality.
</P>
<P>
Iran's politically-charged press has been active in urging for
changes and reforms. In the past Iranian calendar year ended on
March 19, the conservatives revoked licenses of 78 publications in
the capital city alone.
</P>
<P>
In the past weeks, several prominent reformist journalists were
summoned to the press court, the Intelligence Ministry and other
authorities.
</P>
<P>
On March 30, Mohammad Reza Khatami, the president's brother and
managing director of the reformist daily Mosharekat (participation)
was called to the press court.
</P>
<P>
Reza Khatami was the top winner in the Tehran constituency in
the February 18 parliamentary election, in which reformists won an
overwhelming victory. The conservatives, though defeated, still
retain their grip on most of the state powers.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the reformist daily Sobh-e Emrouz (This
Morning) Saeed Hajjarian, a close ally of the president, was shot
and seriously wounded by gunmen on March 12, days before the
Iranian new year.
</P>
<P>
After several journalists were summoned by the courts and the
Intelligence Ministry, the Iranian Union of Journalists on Monday
expressed concern over restrictions on the press.
</P>
<P>
"Summoning journalists to the Intelligence Ministry and the
Public Court on journalistic charges will threaten their job
security and independence," the union said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The union called on authorities concerned to treat the
journalists under the constitution and pertinent laws, IRNA said.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Turkish Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Following a summit on Monday, the three leaders of Turkish
ruling coalition called on the 406 deputies, who had signed the
constitutional amendment motion for President Suleyman Demirel's
second term in office, to act in line with their signatures.
</P>
<P>
The leaders vowed to take "all necessary measures" to have the
deputies do so in Wednesday's second round of voting.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition suffered a crushing defeat in the first
round of voting on the amendment last Wednesday because of
defections by many deputies of the coalition partner Motherland
Party.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- The Turkish Treasury Ministry said on Monday that it will not
provide any credit guarantees for the 5-million-U.S.-dollar Akkuyu
Nuclear Power Plant project until the end of 2000 and not review it
for the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
This move meant that the bid for the project in southern Turkey,
which has been delayed several times, might be cancelled.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Energy Ministry is planning to take
the "Build-Operate-Transfer" (BOT) model for the construction of
the plant.
</P>
<P>
Sabah (Morning):
</P>
<P>
-- The inflation rate in March, for the first time in 13 months,
dropped under 3 percent in Turkey, according to figures of the
State Statistics Institute on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In March, the wholesale price index (TEFE) increased by 3.1
percent, and consumer price index (TUFE) by 2.9 percent, compared
to 4.0 percent and 4.1 percent respectively in the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The yearly inflation rate in the TEFE was estimated at 66.1
percent and TUFE at 67.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Manila Conducts Study on Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- With the help of Latin American
economist Hernando de Soto, the Philippine government is
conducting an in-depth study on poverty in the country, a senior
cabinet member said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio speech that
de Soto's work will play a major role in President Joseph Estrada'
s efforts to map out a long-term plan against poverty.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada has commissioned a team, which is led by
political economist de Soto from Peru, to conduct a study on
poverty in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Zamora described de Soto as a respected economist who
concentrates on poverty, as opposed to other economists who look
at market forces,the stock market and capital accumulation.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Estrada reportedly made public a plan to end what he
called"the economic apartheid" of the poor and give them a
fighting chance to improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
According to Estrada, the plan aims to achieve three goals:
reform the legal system to make it more accessible to the poor,
help low-income Filipinos make their assets liquid and transform
the Philippine bureaucracy into a user-friendly entity that the
poor can tap to help them improve their lives.

<HEADLINE> Two Killed in Zimbabwean Political Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Two people have been killed and
over 100 injured recently in almost 40 cases of political violence
in Zimbabwe, The Herald newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 120 people have been arrested in the violence. Police
Monday vowed to get tough with both the perpetrators and political
leaders bent on instigating violence or any such acts.
</P>
<P>
Police said the chaos have resulted in assaults, malicious
injury to property, theft, public violence and murder, in which
millions of dollars of property have been damaged, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are worried about the violence that erupts when people
'imported' from other areas invade venues far from their homes," a
police spokesman was quoted as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"In many cases, we have been shocked to arrest people out in
the country and find out they would have been bused from Harare or
other towns to perpetrate acts of violence in other towns or rural
areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "where we can prove it, we shall not hesitate
to hold the leaders of such political meetings responsible for
such disturbances."
</P>
<P>
Police blamed unscrupulous politicians of luring unemployed
youths by giving them free liquor so that they could intimidate
and invade the privacy and rights of others.
</P>
<P>
"We have now mobilized the police in all provinces to monitor
all activities of political parties so that their actions do not
disturb the public peace and safety," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Launch Customs Bond Guarantee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) has announced that it will soon launch
the COMESA Customs Bond Guarantee system which will utilize 1.2
billion U.S. dollars tied up in commercial banks in the region.
</P>
<P>
COMESA assistant secretary general Sindiso Ngwenya confirmed
the development in an interview here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's Zambia Daily Mail newspaper quoted Ngwenya as saying
that the launching of the Customs Bond Guarantee will safeguard
the economic activities of respective member states as it will
stop business by any organization or individual in another country
without paying duty.
</P>
<P>
"COMESA is not only about the Free Trade Area. There are a lot
of programs which we are working on and which will benefit the
economies of the members," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said as one of the many such ventures and programs, COMESA
Customs Bond is simply a COMESA community transit system.
</P>
<P>
"The COMESA Customs Bond Agreement will make transporters and
business people moving goods across the region obtain bonds
locally and have that bond be guaranteed for their goods in those
countries they will go to," Ngwenya said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the bond will be required so that people who
have declared goods and are in transit do not sell them in the
country for which they were declared.
</P>
<P>
"It will ensure that people don't sell without paying duty
because allowing such business practices can destroy local
economies," Ngwenya said, adding that "1.2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of cash is tied up in customs bonds in commercial banks and
other financial organizations in the region."
</P>
<P>
COMESA is currently working on a zero rating program that will
culminate in the creation of a Free Trade Area by the end of
October this year.

<HEADLINE> S. African Gov't Supports Well Organized Trade Unions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Jacob Zuma reaffirmed Monday the government's support
for a strong labor movement amid growing tension between
government and the Congress of South African Trade Unions( Cosatu)
over the federation's job loss campaign.
</P>
<P>
Zuma was speaking at the 17th world congress of the
International Confederation of Trade Unions in Durban, South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The congress, which is being attended by about 1,000 labor
delegates from across the world, is jointly hosted by Cosatu,
Nactu (National Congress of Trade Unions) and Fedusa (Federated
Unions of South Africa).
</P>
<P>
"We are firmly in favor of a strong, well-organized, visionary
and independent trade union movement as this can only be to the
advantage of the transformation project in our country," Zuma
said.
</P>
<P>
His comments came as Cosatu continued its countrywide campaign
against, among others, job losses. The campaign will culminate in
a national strike by Cosatu's 1.8 million members on May 10.
</P>
<P>
Cosatu has claimed that since 1994 there have been 500,000 job
losses. It started its mass action campaign against these job
losses on January 31, with various unions affiliated to the
federation organizing workplace protests and demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Zuma told the conference that growing unemployment remained one
of the biggest challenges facing trade unions, not only in South
Africa, but across the world.
</P>
<P>
There are still insufficient flows of foreign investment into
African countries, which is vital to their economic prospects such
as job creation, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on trade unions to focus on issues such as debt
relief and protectionist practices by developed countries who
continually failed to open up markets to developing nations on
favorable conditions.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that trade unions in developed countries invest a
percentage of their retirement and annuity funds towards job
retention and creation in developing countries.

SEOUL -- The South Korean won fell to the 1,110-won range

The South Korean currency, which appreciated to 1,104 won

<HEADLINE> Chevron Adds Investment in China's Offshore Oil Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. oil company Chevron plans
to invest 45 million U.S. dollars in China's offshore exploration
and development this year, a senior Chevron official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Most of this money is expected to be spent on existing
exploration projects, and the rest on new ventures, said Wes Lohec,
managing director of Chevron Overseas Petroleum Inc's Asia
Business Unit.
</P>
<P>
Chevron was among the first group of foreign oil firms to
become involved in Sino-foreign oil offshore exploration in the
Huizhou Oilsfield of the South China Sea, which now boast the
largest production of any offshore oilfields in China.
</P>
<P>
The Huizhou production center, approximately 160 km offshore of
Hong Kong, came on stream in 1990. Total production from four of
the major fields in Huizhou is now 120,000 barrels of oil per day.
</P>
<P>
China has formed a joint operation team, called the CACT
Operators Group, which includes the China National Offshore Oil
Corporation, Agip, Chevron, and Texaco, to take charge of
operations at the Huizhou fields.
</P>
<P>
Lohec observed that three Chinese oil flagship companies,
namely China National Petroleum Corp.(CNPC), China Offshore Oil Co.
and China Petrochemical Corp.(Sinopec), are streamlining
production and preparing for initial public offerings this year.
</P>
<P>
"I see more openness from CNPC and Sinopec, and I see signs
that they will be more and more open onshore," said Lohec.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that the on-going reform will create more
opportunities for the company to have a broader range of projects
with China, including onshore operations and downstream oil
refining, as well as natural gas exploration.
</P>
<P>
Chevron invested 90 million U.S. dollars in a polystyrene plant
in the port city of Zhangjiagang, Jiangsu Province in east China.
The has a production capacity of 100,000 tons a year, and will
become operational in the second quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Chevron, whose roots trace back to 1879, is one of the largest
oil refineries in the United States. The company is now preparing
to sink more oil wells in China's Bohai Bay and South China Sea.

He often complained that he felt lonely now. "I even could not
see a neighbor for a couple of days," as all the doors of the
apartments were closed tightly, said he, a retired doctor.
</P>
<P>
While living in the old house, many patients went to visit him.
The demolishment of the old house forced him to end his career as
a doctor, the old man said, adding that the old house was really
damp and dark, but "I'm used to it."
</P>
<P>
Social scholars also felt a pity for the disappearance of the "
diaojiaolou" house. Li Xiangbei, a professor from the Chongqing
University, said that such houses are unique to Chongqing.
Although similar in outer appearance, each "diaojiaolou" house
reflected the difference in the thinking of each family when they
built house.
</P>
<P>
Yin Guojun, assistant director of the Chongqing municipal
construction committee, held a different view. According to him,
a city must first be habitable and then consider the question of
its appearance.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing municipal government has also sensed the
importance of preserving the city's characteristics and decided to
reserve some unique "diaojiaolou" houses.
</P>
<P>
There are now 10,000 "diaojiaolou" houses in Chongqing, most of
which are due to be dismantled in the next few years.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Base Woos Foreign Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province in Northeast
China, home to one-tenth of the country's state-owned enterprises
(SOE), plans to make use of 500 million U.S. dollars of foreign
loans to develop the local economy this year.
</P>
<P>
The province is also working on establishing a special reserve
to ensure that foreign loans can be repaid on time, a provincial
official said today.
</P>
<P>
As China's reform and opening up drive continues, this
traditional industrial base is finding foreign loans an important
resource for local economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the province borrowed 271.53 million U.
S. dollars from international financial organizations and foreign
governments in 1999 alone. Nearly two-thirds of these loans came
from the World Bank, the province's largest creditor.
</P>
<P>
With these loans, Liaoning has improved its urban
infrastructure and supported sustainable development programs and
afforestation programs in poor areas, and technology renovation
programs in the SOEs in its capital of Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
Non-state enterprises and private businesses in the province
also have access to foreign loans. In 1999 alone, six such
enterprises have received a total of 3.6 million yuan (about 433,
700 U.S. dollars) of World Bank loans as working capital.

<P>
Ren Jiyu, director of the National Library of China, said the

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan currency Afghani has
plummeted to an all-time low amid reports of damage to the country
's opium crop, news reports reaching here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the capital of Kabul, the value of the Afghani slumped to
around 59,000 Afghanis against the U.S. dollar, showing a six
percent decline. Last week one dollar could fetch 50,000 Afghanis.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said dealers in the capital's money market were
trying to sell as much Afghanis as they could.
</P>
<P>
They said the downslide followed an increase in the supply of
Afghanis recently on the markets in Kabul and in the southern
province of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said the Afghani started losing value following
reports that opium poppy crops in southern Afghanistan were
damaged by the current drought, which aroused the concern of the
already impoverished people in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Opium production is one of the main revenue resources of
Afghanistan, which has been at war for 20 years now. Last year the
United Nations said the war-torn country was the biggest opium-
producer in the world with a production of 4,600 tons.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Won Back to 1,110-Won Level Over Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean won fell to the 1,
110-won range Tuesday on massive buying of dollars by the Bank of
Korea to curb its fast appreciation against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean currency, which appreciated to 1,104 won
against the dollar Monday, was changing hands at 1,130 won Tuesday
afternoon due to the central bank's intervention, which bought at
least 500 million U.S. dollars through domestic commercial banks,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's intervention was seen as determination of
the government to maintain the currency rally above the 1,110-won
support level.
</P>
<P>
The intervention came on top of a continued verbal intervention
by the Ministry of Finance and Economy.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to rein in the rising currency, the ministry has
announced that it will issue about one trillion won worth of
foreign exchange equalization bonds this month.
</P>
<P>
The ministry doesn't want the local currency to appreciate
against the greenback too fast because it fears a high won will
deal a serious blow to the nation's exports, which account for
nearly half of its gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Russia Launches Crew to Mir Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Tuesday successfully
launched a two-member crew to the Mir space station from the
Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
The Soyuz PM-30 blast off from Baikonur shortly after 9:01 a.m.
Moscow time (0500 GMT) and entered the planned orbit minutes later,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The spaceship, carrying flight commander Sergei Zaletin and
flight engineer Alexander Kaleri, is scheduled to dock with Mir on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zaletin is on his first mission to the 14-year-old station, but
it is the third for Kaleri.
</P>
<P>
The official duration of the current mission is 45 days but it
may be prolonged to 60 or 75 days if additional funding is found.
</P>
<P>
It is the first manned flight since Mir was put on auto-pilot a
year ago prior to its planned scrapping. Moscow decided to go
ahead with a new mission after securing 20 million U.S. dollars
from a group of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Mir was to have been brought down this year by plunging it
toward earth and burning up in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The task for Zaletin and Kaleri is to reactivate the station
and conduct maintenance operations and repairs on onboard
equipment.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important and complicated tasks is to detect
tiny cracks from which air escapes from the station.
</P>
<P>
The leak of air, which led to a pressure drop in the station,
does not affect the safety of flights because air is disappearing
very slowly and can be compensated from the stores on Mir,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Mission Control expressed the hope that at least the module
from which the air is leaking should be discovered. Even if the
escape of air is not stopped, it would be very useful for the
future operation of the International Space Station now under
construction.
</P>
<P>
The crew also has to analyze the reliability of the station and
its capability to function. Any further decisions on Mir's use
will be made on the basis of this analysis.
</P>
<P>
The cosmonauts will also conduct a series of scientific
experiments and make a space walk.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a Progress M1-1 supply ship docked with Mir with
fuel and water. Zaletin and Kaleri are expected to receive another
Progress cargo spaceship in April.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Welcomes Support for China Trade from Governors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. leading coalition of
businesses supporting trade with China Monday welcomed the
overwhelming support by America's governors for permanent Normal
Trade Relations (PNTR) with China.
</P>
<P>
In a letter released during President Clinton's visit to
California Monday, more than 40 governors urged Congressional
approval of PNTR.
</P>
<P>
"Governors know PNTR is a no-brainer because they are closest
to the economic heartbeat of the nation," said Myron Brilliant,
managing director for Asia at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and co-
chairman of the Business Coalition for U.S.-China Trade, in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"So many of America's governors are united on this issue
because the benefits of trade with China transcend one state or
one region. Increased access to China's markets would benefit the
hog farmer in the heartland just as much as the software whiz in
Silicon Valley."
</P>
<P>
During the president's visit to California, more than 200 chief
executives from America's high-tech industry also endorsed PNTR
with China in an open letter.
</P>
<P>
"The leaders of America's New Economy understand the power of
the Internet to promote change in China," said Calman J. Cohen,
president of the Emergency Committee for American Trade and
another co-chair of the Coalition, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Also in a statement, Robert A. Kapp, president of the U.S.-
China Business Council and co-chair of the Coalition, welcomed the
decision made by Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) who was previously
undecided on PNTR and announced her support for the measure Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The solid core of centrists in both parties who support PNTR
continues to expand," Kapp said. "These Democrats and Republicans
know that for America's workers and farmers, China's market access
concessions will be meaningless without timely approval of PNTR."
</P>
<P>
The Business Coalition for U.S.-China Trade consists of over 1,
200 leading American companies, trade associations and farm
organizations that support PNTR with China. It is co-chaired by
the Business Roundtable, the Emergency Committee for American
Trade, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the U.S.-China Business
Council.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Savings Deposits Sharply Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The savings deposits at South
Korea's domestic banks rose 30.59 trillion won (some 27.2 billion
U.S. dollars in the first quarter of this year, bringing the total
to 307.03 trillion won (roughly 270 billion dollars), the Bank of
Korea said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the jump in savings deposits to
customers' preference of safety over profitability in the wake of
the Daewoo Group crisis.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of money withdrawn from investment funds containing
Daewoo bonds moved into local banks, leading to the surge and due
to the Daewoo shock, customers seem to be putting safety before
profits, analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Savings deposits jumped 9.88 trillion won (roughly 8.9 billion
dollars) in January, 12.57 trillion won (11.3 billion dollars) in
February and 8.24 trillion won (7.4 billion dollars) in March.
</P>
<P>
The increase in savings deposits in the quarter is already
close to half the total gain of 66.8 trillion won (60.1 billion
dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the boom in bank savings deposits, bond-type
beneficiary certificates at investment trust companies saw an
exodus of 28.17 trillion won (25.3 billion dollars) in the first
quarter of this year, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
Funds invested in bond-type beneficiary certificates decreased
4.93 trillion won (4.4 billion dollars) in January, 16.87 trillion
won (15.2 billion dollars) in February and 6.35 trillion won (5.7
billion dollars) in March.
</P>
<P>
Money deposited at long-term bond-type beneficiary certificates
fell 24.18 trillion won (21.7 billion dollars) in the three-month
period while 3.99 trillion won (3.6 billion dollars) fled short-
term beneficiary certificates.
</P>
<P>
However, stock-type beneficiary certificates jumped 9.35
trillion won (8.4 billion dollars) in the first three months
because of booming stock market.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Reportedly Kill All Police Captives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Federal Security
Service (FSB) said Tuesday that Chechen rebels executed all nine
elite policemen they captured earlier last week in Zhani-Vedeno in
southern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The executions took place Sunday, the FSB public relations
center said, citing convincing information, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The center said the FSB, the main successor to the Soviet KGB,
had received information convincingly exposing a planned
provocation of supporters of field commanders Khattab and Shamil
Basayev to feign the exchange of the policemen.
</P>
<P>
As many as 43 federal soldiers and policemen were reportedly
killed last week in a deadly ambush by the rebels
</P>
<P>
The militants, in an alleged official statement on the Internet,
suggested an exchange of nine Russian elite OMON policemen
captured in combat near Zhani-Vedeno for a Russian colonel
recently arrested on charges of raping and killing a Chechen woman.
</P>
<P>
They had threatened to shoot all the nine policemen if the
proposal was not accepted.
</P>
<P>
The FSB said the executions were designed to "paint the federal
command in a negative light as persons unwilling to rescue their
own men from the hands of militants."
</P>
<P>
According to intercepted radio communications between Khattab,
a Jordanian national fighting alongside the Chechens, and Khabib,
another Arab fighter, Khattab said: The situation was very
difficult and we killed them, the FSB said.

CHONGQING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Fu Xiaoqing, 45, spent his past
43 years with his eight family members in a 40-sq-m stilted house
on mountain slopes, with no cooking gas, no toilet and no water
supply and bath facilities.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Fu moved into an 80-sq apartment in downtown
Chongqing, known as a "city of mountain" in southwest China, with
all modern household facilities, electrical appliances and
beautiful decorations.
</P>
<P>
Fu was one of the beneficiaries of the city's campaign aimed
at dismantling the stilted houses on mountain slopes which were
mainly built along the banks of the Yangtze and Jialingjiang
rivers by boat trackers in the past.
</P>
<P>
The houses built with bamboo matting and wood were called "
diaojiaolou" in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Such houses notorious for darkness and dampness were now the
target of the city's clean-up campaign.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, the municipal government had
invested nearly 30 billion yuan (about 3.6 billion U.S. dollars)
to construct 58 million sq. m. of residential and office buildings
in the city's old area, and about 4,700 families that used to live
in "diaojiaolou" houses have moved into new apartments with

<HEADLINE> Corruption Elimination in Bangladesh Could Help GDP: WB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh could add 2.1 to 2.9
percent to its annual Gross Domestic Product growth if it could
reduce corruption level to those in countries with the highest
reputation for honest dealing, a World Bank draft report was
quoted by The Daily Star Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
This could also lower the country's poverty rate by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The draft report, entitled "Corruption in Bangladesh, Costs and
Cures," is the donors' official paper to be discussed at the
Bangladesh Development Forum which will be held on April 13-14 in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank termed the corruption in Bangladesh "
unaffordable, unacceptable and treatable," saying: "Once the
national will is expressed in a consensus that corruption must be
curbed, it can also be cured."
</P>
<P>
The report said the business community in Bangladesh confronts
numerous costly government-imposed rules and obstacles that
encourage corruption.
</P>
<P>
Indecisiveness on the part of the political leadership,
politicization of the civil service, pervasive corruption and
nepotism among civil servants, and the silence of civil society on
this score can all be faulted, the Bank observed.

He said he has no problem with raising cloned cows. "Now I have
three types cows. The natural ones, an artificially inseminated
one and a cloned one living in the same barn."
</P>
<P>
Scientists have kept the identity of Thailand's first cloned
calf a guarded secret.
</P>
<P>
According to Rangsun Parnpai, pioneer researcher for this
project, Ing's parental origin comprised of the SK 29 prototype
cell which was an ear cell from a 13-month Brahmin cow and an egg
extracted from a uterus obtained from a slaughterhouse.
</P>
<P>
The prototype ear cell and egg were fused together by
electricity before being implanted in the womb of a surrogate
mother cow last June.
</P>
<P>
Ing was not born alone. She has a twin brother, "An", which was
conceived through artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
Maneewan Kamonpatana, director of the Research Center for
Bioscience in Animal Production, was quoted as saying that the
latest achievement has put Thailand in the frontline of animal
breeding technology in the academic world.
</P>
<P>
In practice, it would take another three years to observe Ing
in comparison with naturally born cows.
</P>
<P>
If the clone proves superior, Maneewan said it could become a
cost-effective breeding method for the dairy farming industry.
</P>
<P>
Cloning technology may provide healthier, higher yielding cows
which cost less to raise.
</P>
<P>
On the question of ethics, Maneewan said she expected no
ethical conflict from this experiment. "It is not against nature
at all. There is no genetic engineering involved and the gene of
Ing was not altered or changed," said Maneewan.
</P>
<P>
The center has a similar experiment with 79 other cloned cells
implanted in recipients, but only about 10 are currently pregnant
while the rest have prematurely aborted.

<HEADLINE> Concerted Efforts To Combat TB Urged in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Provincial Minister
for Law and Parliamentary Affairs Barrister Shahida Jamil has
called for concerted efforts to eradicate the tuberculosis disease
from the country.
</P>
<P>
At the inaugural ceremony of an international conference on TB
and lung diseases in Karachi on Monday, Shahida Jamil said: "We
should work in partnership to carry forward the task of
elimination of TB and the non-governmental organizations should
also play their role in this respect," according to a news
dispatch received here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
She said there is a lack of understanding as to what TB is all
about, adding that something wrong appears to be with the medical
education which is needed to be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
She stressed the need for chalking out an effective TB control
strategy and pledged the government's support for it.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization representative in Pakistan,
Mohammed Abide Jam, said eight million people develop TB every
year around the globe and each one of them can infect between 10
and 15 people in one year. Up to 50 million people may be infected
with drug-resistant TB.
</P>
<P>
He warned that some one dies of TB every 10 seconds although
almost every one could have or should have been cured.

<HEADLINE> Judge's Ruling Against Microsoft in U.S. Applauded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Industry analysts believe U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson's ruling that Microsoft violated the Sherman Antitrust Act
by tying its Web browser to its operating system and changed the
competitive landscape in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
One competitor, Red Hat, a Durham, N.C.-based leader in the
emerging Linux operating system, said the ruling will improve
competition in the marketplace and will eventually benefit
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
"It's not good or bad news in as much as it's going to create
more opportunities for competitors, such as ourselves, to
negotiate contracts with Dell and IBM," Red Hat Chairman Robert
Young said.
</P>
<P>
"We're successfully creating a lot of interest in the
marketplace, but unless our bigger competitor is restrained from
doing some of the things it has been doing in the marketplace, it'
s going to be difficult for us to deliver to the customer," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Young said the only possible negative in the court's decision
is a public relations problem in which the case has forced
technology companies to take sides.
</P>
<P>
Jim Barksdale, former CEO of Netscape, the Web browser that
dominated the market before competition with Microsoft overwhelmed
the company, said he has personally experienced Microsoft's way of
doing business.
</P>
<P>
Sun Microsystems applauded Judge Jackson's decision saying that
only a combination of "stringent structural and behavioral
remedies" against Microsoft will ensure healthy competition.
</P>
<P>
"Today's important decision confirms what almost everybody in
the world knows: Microsoft is a monopoly that has acted illegally,
" said Scott McNealy, Sun's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
"The Justice Department and the states deserve immense credit
for putting together a case that so clearly showed Microsoft's
true colors," he added.
</P>
<P>
Intuit Chairman and acting CEO Bill Campbell said the decision
is crucial to "continued innovation on the Internet and the growth
of electronic commerce."
</P>
<P>
"We trust in the continued good efforts of the Department of
Justice and Judge Jackson to determine a fair way to separate the
Windows operating system from Microsoft's other businesses,"
Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
Oracle Corp. said little in a prepared statement beyond saying
it hopes that Judge Jackson's remedies will match the seriousness
of the violations.
</P>
<P>
"We're eagerly awaiting the opportunity to review in detail the
ruling by Judge Jackson in this most important case affecting our
industry," said Dan Cooperman, senior vice president and general
counsel for Oracle Corp.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the remedies ultimately imposed or agreed upon
will be commensurate with the seriousness of the violation of
antitrust law, which has now been determined by the court," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Corel Corp. was satisfied with the ruling, and expected it will
help improve competition.
</P>
<P>
"For us, anything that is going to enhance competition in the
marketplace is going to be a good thing for consumers," said
Kathryn Hughes, a spokeswoman for Corel Corp.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 of 50 states filed antitrust suits against
Microsoft during the past years.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: S.Korea Launches Campaign to Fight Livestock Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has launched an all-out
campaign to fight the spread of a vesicular disease called hoof-
and-mouth disease among livestock
</P>
<P>
Cases of the epidemic disease have been reported in other areas
in the country after livestock in Paju, Hongsong, and Yonki were
found dead from the disease this week.
</P>
<P>
The hoof-and-mouth disease, dubbed livestock AIDS, causes
blisters on the mouths and hoofs of livestock, has killed
innumerable head of livestock in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is caused by a highly infectious virus which spreads very
fast to hoofed livestock through air and fodder, but has up to a
two-week incubation period.
</P>
<P>
Fearing that a nationwide spread of the disease will destroy
the nation's livestock industry, the South Korean government
decided at an emergency meeting Monday to vaccinate 12,000 heads
of cattle and pigs per day and to conduct a serum inspection of
all livestock throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, It has also decided to destroy and bury all the
livestock within a 20-kilometer radius of the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
The government has also earmarked 3.5 billion won (3.16 million
U.S. dollars) to compensate the farmers whose livestock were
slaughtered to prevent spread of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the outbreak of the epidemic, Japan and China's Taiwan
have suspended import of livestock and meat from South Korea,
while the United States and Australia have halted import of dairy
products.
</P>
<P>
Experts warned that the entire foundation of South Korea's
livestock industry and exports are at stake, citing the example of
the same disease which cost China's Taiwan astronomical losses,
including 180,000 job losses in the Chinese province in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, observers said Japan will likely ban imports of
South Korean livestock and meat at least one year. South Korea
exported pork worth 415 million dollars to Japan last year.
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, domestic consumption of beef and pork
decreased recently in the aftermath of the outbreak of the
livestock epidemic.
</P>
<P>
However, the Bank of Korea officials said that livestock
industry accounts for 0.67 percent of the country's GDP and 26
percent of total production, estimating the yearly damages at 310
billion won (some 300 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reiterates Call For PNTR With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday reiterated his call for congressional approval of permanent
normal trade relations (PNTR) with China in a speech in the
Silicon Valley, where high-tech executives and moderate Democrats
strongly support free trade with China.
</P>
<P>
"If we do this, 20 years from now, we will wonder why we ever
had a serious debate about it," the president said. "If we don't
do it, 20 years from now, we'll still be kicking ourselves for
being so dumb."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at San Jose's Technology Museum of Innovation in the
center of Silicon Valley, Clinton said the defeat of PNTR with
China would have negative consequences for the U.S. economy and
for Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
"The main consequence of this would be to hurt America
economically and to dramatically strain our relationship with
China at a time when we need to maintain a positive ability to
impact their conduct, to reduce strains along the Taiwan Straits,
and to get the leaders in that country to imagine the greatness of
their country in future terms, not yesterday's terms," Clinton
said, emphasizing "This is a big deal."
</P>
<P>
House Minority leader Richard Gephardt, California Gov. Gray
Davis, as well as 150 executives from high-tech companies attended
the event.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The Clinton administration Monday released two
letters urging Congress to approve PNTR with China, one signed by
40 governors supporting trade with China, and the other by chief
executive officers of 200 high-tech companies, including Microsoft,
IBM and Sun Microsystems, who recently began a major lobbying
campaign in Capitol Hill for PNTR with China.
</P>
<P>
"We consider it the most critical vote you will make in support
of our high-technology industries," the executives wrote in their
letter to Congressmen.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Congress is scheduled to vote on PNTR with China in May.
Some House Democrats and organized labor oppose the trade
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We tried to get the high-technology community more involved in
the effort around this vote," White House spokesman Jake Siewert
said. "A lot of members on the Hill listen to the high-tech
community. They are the ones creating jobs."

<HEADLINE> NBA Suspends, Fines Childs, Bryant for Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The NBA Monday suspended New
York Knicks guard Chris Childs for two games and Los Angeles
Lakers guard Kobe Bryant one game for fighting during Sunday's
game in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
NBA Vice presideng Rod Thorn said Childs instigated the fight
and threw punches during Sunday's nationally televised game.
Bryant was disciplined for responding with a punch.
</P>
<P>
Childs was suspended without pay for two games and fined 15,000
US dollars. Bryant was suspended without pay for one game, which
based on his 9-million-dollar salary for the season will cost him
100,000 dollars, and fined 5,000 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The incident occured with 43 seconds left in the third quarter
of the Lakers' 106-82 rout of New York. The pair got into a
shoving match that escalated with Childs punching Bryant in the
jaw. Both players received double technicals for fighting and were
ejected.
</P>
<P>
Childs will sit out Thursday's game at Washington and Friday's
contest in Orlando. Bryant is to miss the Lakers' game at Phoenix
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Portland's Wallace Sets NBA Record of Technical Fouls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Rasheed Wallace, Portland
Trail Blazers' leading scorer, set an NBA record for technical
fouls in a season when he picked up two in succession and was
ejected Sunday in the second quarter of the game with Seattle
SuperSonics.
</P>
<P>
Wallace was issued the technicals by referee Joey Crawford with
10:37 left in the second quarter. Wallace's 34 technicals break
the mark of 32 held by Charles Barkley and Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
The Blazers led by just three points at the time, 22-29, but
they settled down and used their deep bench to keep the Sonics at
bay.
</P>
<P>
"It's just Rasheed," Pippen said of Wallace's sixth early exit
of the season. "He's been tossed more than any guy in the league.
I mean, why would it surprise me when he gets tossed tonight?"
</P>
<P>
"Techs ain't nothing," said Wells, one of Wallace's closet
friends on the team. "That's just Rasheed. That's my man.
Sometimes the refs give him something that he don't deserve, but
it don't change the type of person that Rasheed is or the way I
feel about him. He's a great guy, and techs just happen."
</P>
<P>
The Blazers started the game by missing 14 of their first 17
shots, and the Sonics got a few easy baskets off long rebounds. A
3-pointer by Lewis capped a 10-0 run and put Seattle ahead 16-10
before the Blazers came back to take a 19-18 lead entering the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Blazers went up by seven on a drive by Stoudamire with 3:24
left in the period, but the Sonics rallied to get within 45-43 at
the half. The Blazers finally pulled away and defeated the
SuperSonics 95-82.

<HEADLINE> Thai Inflation Low Despite Oil Price Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Consumer Price Index (
CPI) in the first quarter of this year rose only 0.9 percent from
the same period last year despite recent oil price hikes, the
Bangkok Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
World oil prices reached a record high of 30 U.S. dollars a
barrel last month, causing diesel prices in Thailand to mount to
nearly 13 baht (35 U.S. cents) a liter while premium petrol to 16
baht (43 cents).
</P>
<P>
Quoting the Commerce Ministry, the newspaper said the oil price
rises had contributed to an increase in the non-food and beverage
index by 2.5 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The transport and communication sector saw the steepest rise at
8.3 percent, followed by tobacco and alcoholic drinks at 1.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the food and beverage index contracted by 1.7 percent
due to declines in farm product prices.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the figures showed that Thai consumers in
general were not experiencing inflationary pressure.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has projected a 2.2 percent to 2.5 percent inflation
rate in 2000, up from the 0.3 percent rate in 1999.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Expects Talks With Japan to Be Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) said Tuesday that it hopes the ninth-round DPRK-
Japan talks on normalization of bilateral relations will "proceed
smoothly and make achievements" and that "the thick ice" in
bilateral ties will melt.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial, Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the ruling
Workers' Party, said that the talks, scheduled to be resumed soon
after being suspended eight years ago, are expected to "proceed
smoothly and make achievements," and "the long-frozen deep ice
between the two countries will melt."
</P>
<P>
The editorial also expressed the hope that the two countries
will develop a new pattern of friendly ties. "All of this conforms
to the aspiration of the two peoples," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government delegation will arrive here Tuesday to
participate in the talks, the editorial said, adding that the
negotiations are not resumed for "bickering" and "should never
repeat the results of a breakdown as the previous talks did."
</P>
<P>
Seriously discussing the pivotal issue existing between the two
countries and settling it are the stance of the DPRK at the talks,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the pivotal issue is the settling of the
historical account with Japan and the resolution to it is "a
shortcut to the normalization of bilateral relations and a basic
and main topic for the DPRK-Japan talks."
</P>
<P>
"Once the issue is resolved, all other problems will be settled
easily," it said. "Otherwise, the current abnormal ties between
the two sides will never change whensoever."
</P>
<P>
The editorial stressed that a good atmosphere should be created
and both sides should make efforts to prevent the talks from
derailing.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK and Japan began their normalization talks in the late
1980s, with eight rounds of talks held before they were suspended
in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Automakers Report Mixed Results In Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
March appeared to be another in a string of good months,
industry experts said, adding that the strong economy and price
competition among automakers were pulling buyers into showrooms
despite higher interest rates and gas prices.
</P>
<P>
Ford, the world's No. 2 automaker, said total sales, including
heavy trucks and its upscale Jaguar and Volvo divisions, rose to
441,701 units. That was a record high for any single month at Ford,
and compared with U.S. sales of 399,908 in March 1999. The
previous monthly sales record was 424,091 units, set in June 1978.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. consumers are confirming that this is a great time to buy
a new car or truck," Bob Rewey, Ford's North American sales chief,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp., the world's largest automaker, said U.S.
sales rose 1.1 percent, excluding its Saab unit, to 458,115 units,
thanks mostly to a 16.2 percent rise in sales in light trucks.
Even so, the results fell short of analysts' expectations of a 2
percent to 4 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
GM officials said the results reflected the company's success
in aligning its production with consumer tastes.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to closely align our vehicle mix with
consumer demand," Bill Lovejoy, GM's North American sales and
marketing chief, said in a statement. "Trucks are a hot commodity.
"
</P>
<P>
Daimler-Chrysler sales were up 4 percent because of a 12
percent rise in car sales. Its mid-sized cars saw the largest
gains, with the Dodge Intrepid up 34 percent and the Chrysler
Concorde up 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
Truck sales were up 1 percent, with demand for mini-vans and
Dodge Dakota four-door pickups outweighing a decline in Dodge and
Jeep SUV sales. Jamie Jameson, Daimler- Chrysler's vice president
for sales and marketing operations, said SUV sales suffered from a
comparison to an even better month last year.

U.S. sales for Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. rose 16 percent to a
best-ever March performance of 140,393 units, as strong demand for
its light trucks offset a decline in sales of the top-selling U.S.
car, the Camry mid-sized sedan.
</P>
<P>
"It's March madness," Jim Press, Toyota executive vice
president, said in a statement. "Consumers closed out the first
quarter with a fast-break buying spree, extending the industry's
string of record-breaking months into overtime."
</P>
<P>
Honda Motor Co. said sales jumped 20 percent, largely because
of a boost in Odyssey mini-van sales.
</P>
<P>
Nissan Motor Co. said its sales were up 11 percent, mostly
behind sales of the Xterra and the Frontier pickup.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen AG said its U.S. sales were up 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Mercedes-Benz side of Daimler-Chrysler said its sales were
up 15 percent. Its M-Class SUVs were up 37 percent, while sales of
its luxury cars climbed 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sales of South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd. surged almost 84
percent last month. Vehicle sales for Japan's Subaru sales rose 4.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Grants Visa to Cuban Boy's Father </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
granted a visa Monday night for the father of the Cuban boy, Elian
Gonzalez, to come to the United States and told the boy's
relatives in Florida to hand over the boy to his father.
</P>
<P>
The father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, will be able to get his visa
as early as on Tuesday. Five others including Elian's kindergarten
teacher in Cuba were also granted visas, State Department
spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"The visas could be issued as early as tomorrow morning," Rubin
added. The visa requests were presented to the U.S. diplomatic
mission in Havana, Cuba last week.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday night, negotiations between Elian's relatives
and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) over the
custody of the boy adjourned without any result, reports reaching
here from Miami said.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report said that the negotiations had
shifted Monday to how to reunite Elian with his father when he
arrives in this country.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department last week demanded that Elian's
relatives in Florida promise to surrender the six-year-old Cuban
boy if they lose their court fight and said that it would end the
custody of the boy by Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Elian, who is currently under the custody of his great uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, in Florida, was rescued on November 25 last year
from a shipwreck after his mother and 11 others died when the boat
capsized in the sea off Florida.
</P>
<P>
The INS ruled earlier this year that the boy belongs to his
father and should be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
However, the decision to return him was delayed after the boy's
great uncle in Florida filed a political asylum for him. U.S.
District Judge K. Michael Moore ruled that only the U.S. attorney
general can grant political asylum to the boy.
</P>
<P>
The boy's father in Cuba, supported by the Cuban government,
insisted that his son should be returned to him while the boy's
great uncle, backed by some anti-Cuba politicians in the U.S.,
asked the boy to stay with him.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Premier Meets Hong Kong Chief Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien met Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region Tung Chee Hwa here Monday to discuss a wide
range of issues involving economic, financial and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Canada and Hong Kong have an opportunity to improve future ties
and opportunities by forming a meaningful relationship, Tung told
a press conference after a meeting on Parliament Hill.
</P>
<P>
The two sides enjoy a genuinely "human relationship" with half
a million overseas Chinese from Hong Kong living in Canada and 150,
000 Canadians making Hong Kong their home, according to the chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
"I think future opportunities for Canadian firms will be found
in Asia, as most of the countries in Asia recover from the
financial turmoil of the last 2.5 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I also think that commercial opportunities for Canadian
companies will increase as a result of China's accession to WTO,"
Tung said, adding that he is very optimistic about China's entry
into the World Trade Organization by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will be an excellent base for Canadian firms that
want to extend their business activities in Asia and on the
mainland of China," he said.
</P>
<P>
As one of the most important trading and commercial centers in
the world, Hong Kong has become the 13th largest export market for
Canada, which, in turn, is Hong Kong's 11th importer.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Tung also met with Canadian Finance
Minister Paul Martin and Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy on the
issues of common interests.
</P>
<P>
Tung said he was happy to visit Canada for the first time in
his capacity as the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Canada for the United States Wednesday, Tung is
scheduled to address the Hong Kong-Canada Business Association in
Toronto Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tung arrived in Toronto Saturday to begin his four-day visit.
Chinese Ambassador Mei Ping met Tung at the Toronto airport.

<HEADLINE> Book on Findings of Ancient Ruins Published in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China has published the second
volume of a book on research findings of a joint Sino-Japanese
exploration to Niya, an ancient city buried in China's largest
desert.
</P>
<P>
The book covers archaeological discoveries made between 1994
and 1997 at the Niya ruins in the Taklimakan Desert in Xinjiang in
northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The first volume of the book was published in 1995, introducing
the discoveries made during their joint exploration from 1988 to
1993.
</P>
<P>
The Niya ruins, known as the Pompeii on the ancient Silk Road,
were the site of the ancient Jingjue Kingdom set up at an oasis by
the Niya River during the Han (206 BC-AD 220) and Jin (265-420 AD)
dynasties
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, the kingdom, located at the
foot of the Kunlun Mountains, had only 480 households with 3,360
persons during the Han Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
It became famous and prosperous on the ancient Silk Road during
the Tang Dynasty (618-907), and was buried in sands later.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and Japanese archaeologists formed a joint exploration
team in 1988 and have made nine explorations to the ruins for the
past 12 years, according to Chinese archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
They have found some 200 sites of relics including tombs of
aristocrats and a variety of burial objects.
</P>
<P>
The newly published book, in both Chinese and Japanese, is a
comprehensive summary of the joint exploration between 1994 and
1997. It will also be translated into English soon, according to
the Urumqi Publishing House.

<HEADLINE> Poland's Economy Worsens in First Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Poland's economic situation
worsened in the first two months of this year with continuing weak
exports, an increased current account deficit, and a heightened
unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
The east European country's exports dropped to 2.07 billion U.
S. dollars in February from 2.50 billion dollars in the same
period last year, statistics released by Poland's state bank on
Monday revealed.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit rose to 2.16 billion dollars by
March from 1.41 billion in the same period last year. The figure
represents 8 percent of the gross domestic product, compared with
the 1999 level of 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The monthly deficit in February reached 949 million dollars,
nearly doubling that of February, 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to official data issued earlier, the number of
jobless people in Poland increased to 2.53 million in February,
bringing the unemployment rate up to 13.9 percent from 13.6
percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believe that Poland's economic situation failed
to improve because of the weak export.
</P>
<P>
In February, direct foreign investment in Poland was estimated
at about 1.12 billion dollars, up from 608 million in February,
1999.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Plans to Appeal U.S. District Court in Antitrust Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp., not dampened
by Monday's harsh ruling against it in the antitrust lawsuit,
plans to appeal the U.S. District Court while continuing to focus
on creating the next generation of innovative software.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that
Microsoft broke federal antitrust laws when it acted to protect
its monopoly in the Windows operating system and said that the
company put "an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive
fortune."
</P>
<P>
Microsoft said that the ruling was not unexpected, given the
District Court's previous rulings, and it will request an
expedited review by the U.S. Court of Appeals, following a
remedies phase and final decree. The appeal will stress a 1998 U.S.
Court of Appeals decision that affirmed Microsoft's right to
support the Internet in the Windows operating system, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
Confident in prevailing on appeal, Microsoft Chairman Bill
Gates said, "While we did everything we could to settle this case,
and will continue to look for new opportunities to resolve it
without further litigation, we believe we have a strong case on
appeal. The Appeals Court already has affirmed Microsoft's right
to build Internet capabilities into the Windows operating system
to benefit consumers."
</P>
<P>
The current lawsuit seems not to divert Microsoft's attention
to technology innovation. "As we look ahead to the appeals process,
innovation will continue to be the No. 1 priority at Microsoft,"
said Bill Gates. "Microsoft's past success has been built on
innovation and creativity, and our future success depends on our
ability to keep innovating in the fastest-moving marketplace on
earth," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi remains in a coma but his blood pressure is stable, Acting
Prime Minister Mikio Aoki said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi's condition "remains the same as it was yesterday," Aoki
told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
To avoid a political vacuum in the country, the cabinet will
resign en masse in a day or two, the top government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Yoshiro Mori, who holds the No. 2 post of secretary general in
Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), is expected to
succeed Obuchi as party president, which also entails the
premiership.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Tokyo's Juntendo University Hospital are maintaining
the same type of treatment for Obuchi, putting him on a respirator
and using medication to keep his blood pressure stable at a
sufficient level, Aoki said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi was taken to the private university hospital around 1 a.
m. Sunday after suffering a stroke at his official residence. He
was moved to the hospital's intensive care unit and put on a
respirator after his condition worsened Sunday night.

<HEADLINE> Russia Signs Convention to Prevent Terrorist Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia Monday signed the
Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism,
saying that "preventing terrorist financing is a crucial avenue in
the international cooperation to suppress the evil terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Sergey Lavrov, the Russian permanent representative to the
United Nations, entered his name on the Convention on behalf of
his government.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, the Russian Mission to the United
Nations said in a press release that "Russia views this instrument
as an important contribution to the strengthening of the
international legal regime for combating international terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"Preventing terrorist financing is a crucial avenue in the
international cooperation to suppress the evil terrorism," the
press release said. "The Chechen experience proves that."
</P>
<P>
"Russia reiterates its position to counter any acts of
terrorism, by whoever and wherever perpetrated, and irrespective
of the motivation involved, including by preventing and
suppressing in its territory the preparation and financing of
terrorism and denying terrorists safe havens," the press release
said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has some specific concern about what has been provided
in Article 15 of the Convention, namely with respect to the
possibility of refusing in certain conditions the extradition and
legal assistance given with regard to crimes defined in this
Convention," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
"Upon signing, Russia has therefore made a declaration to the
effect that the position of the Russian Federation is that the
provision of Article 15 of the Convention should be implemented in
such a way as to ensure the inevitability of punishment for the
commission of offenses falling within the scope of the Convention,
without detriment to the effectiveness of international
cooperation related to extradition and legal assistance," it added.
</P>
<P>
The Convention was adopted on December 9, 1999 by the General
Assembly, and it was open for signature by all States at the U.N.
Headquarters in New York from January 10, 2000 to December 31,
2001.
</P>
<P>
So far, Russia is the 16th country to sign the Convention,
which shall enter into force on the 30th day following the date of
the deposit of the 22nd instrument of ratification, acceptance,
approval or accession with the Secretary-General of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Convention demands signatories to adapt their domestic law
to make it a punishable crime the action to finance terrorism in
all forms.

<HEADLINE> Australian Scientists Grows Human Nerve Cells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Australian scientists have
succeeded in growing human nerve cells from embryonic stem cells,
the Age daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough was made by Professor Alan Trounson and Dr
Martin Pera of the Monash Institute of Reproduction and
Development at Monash University, with colleagues from Israel and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Creating human nerve cells opened the way for new treatments
for degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Parkinson's and
stroke.
</P>
<P>
Embryonic stem cells are cells derived from the early embryo,
which have the potential to become any cell in the body.
</P>
<P>
Professor Trounson was quoted as saying: "We've been able to
get them to form pure nerve cells out of the embryonic stem cell
line -- no one has done that before."
</P>
<P>
"If these nerve cells produce dopamine they could be used to
treat Parkinson's disease, for example, or in any nerve tissue
repair where there has been an injury," he said. "The implications
are just massive. If we can do this then the next thing may be to
grow blood cells to treat blood diseases or muscle cells."

<HEADLINE> Panama Canal Toll Income Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Income for Panama Canal tolls
reached 240.2 million U.S. dollars, 3.3 million dollars more than
expected during the period of October 1999 to February 2000.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Aleman Zubieta, administrator with the Panama Canal
Authority (PCA), revealed Monday that the total number of ship's
using the canal reached an average of 33.3 passages per day, or 5,
061 crossings in the first five months of the fiscal year, which
began on October 1,1999, to September 30, this year.
</P>
<P>
Aleman also said the widening project of Corte Culebra, the
canal's narrowest point has been 83 percent completed and is
expected to be finished by December.
</P>
<P>
"Figures show the Canal keeps on being a route of importance
for world sea trading. We continue working on it to increase
capacity and so be able to offer a quicker and safer service to
our users."
</P>
<P>
The 81.3 kilometer-long Canal, continues to play a significant
role in world sea trading as a shortcut between the Pacific and
Atlantic oceans.
</P>
<P>
The Panama government assumed its full responsibility for the
management, operation and maintenance of the canal and the canal
zone on December 31, 1999, ending the Panama Canal Treaty which
was signed with the United States in 1903.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Hits Record in Czech Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prague, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic attracted 5.1
billion U.S. dollars of foreign capital in 1999, doubled from
previous year, setting a new historic record, according to the
statistics released by Czech National Bank.
</P>
<P>
From April 1998, the Czech government led by Prime Minister
Milos Zeman adopted a series of measures aiming to draw foreign
investment. The investors, who invested over 10 million dollars in
the country, would be free from income tax for five years. The
land used to establish free tax zones could get interest-free
loans. The new measures led to the rapid increase of foreign
capital to 2.4 billion dollars in 1998, 84.6 percent more than in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The foreign investment attracted by the Czech Republic in 1999
was in the second place among the central easteuropean countries,
following Poland. While the average, 493 dollars per person, was
the highest among the nations.
</P>
<P>
Foreign capital is gaining momentum in the country. Holland's
Philips will invest 640 million Euros here to set up the second
biggest color phenotype company in the world. Some big companies
from Japan, South Korea, as well as American and other European
countries are also planning to build branches in the Czech
Republic.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Pays Solidarity Bonus with U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Thousand of senior citizens and
single mothers with children, formed long lines Monday in
different banks in Ecuador to cash their solidarity bonus,
economic assistance the government provided for those least
protected.
</P>
<P>
These beneficiaries were surprised when they received --
instead of 75 or 100 sucres -- three and four U.S. dollars. Their
solidarity bonus, also called poverty bonus, had been dollarized,
and for the first time, citizens were receiving their payment in
dollars, a situation that baffled many who were not aware of the
currency change.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's government started on November 4, 1998, to pay
solidarity bonuses to compensate the eliminating of subsidies for
electricity, domestic gas and diesel for the poorest sectors.
</P>
<P>
This Monday is the first day that solidarity bonus's
beneficiaries received their payment in dollars. Dollarizing began
April 1 in this country. Meanwhile, supermarkets and department
stores are charging buyers in dollars, or sucres.
</P>
<P>
However, in public institutions, charging in dollars hasn't
been standardized yet, which has seen citizens changing their
dollars to sucres for making electricity, drinking water and
telephone payments.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadorian government announced earlier this year, its
currency, the sucre, would be replaced by the U.S. dollar and will
gradually disappear in the next six months.

<HEADLINE> China Is Safe for Foreigners Despite Killing of Germans: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A German Foreign Ministry spokesman
said Monday that China is "still an extremely safe place" for
tourists despite the killing of a German family in the eastern
city of Nanjing on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told reporters that his government will not issue
any warning against traveling to China.
</P>
<P>
Such a warning is issued only when the security order of the
destination has collapsed and foreigners face unpredictable danger,
he said, adding that China is not the case at all.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, a spokeswoman for Daimler-Chrysler said in
Stuttgart that what happened in Nanjing was just an isolate
incident, adding, "China is a safe country."
</P>
<P>
The four members of a German family were stabbed to death when
fighting burglars at their home in the early hours of Sunday in
Nanjing, the capital of east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The victims were Juergen Pfrang, 51, deputy general manager of
Yaxing-Benz, a Sino-German automotive joint venture in the city of
Yangzhou in Jiangsu Province, his wife, son and daughter. All four
suspects were caught on the spot by the police.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Engineer Tests Flapping-Wing Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian engineer is testing a
flapping-wing plane in the hope that the bird-like ornithopter
will take its historic flight this summer.
</P>
<P>
This is the world's first practice to realize a dream as
ancient as that of Icarus, the Ottawa Citizen daily reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft, spanning 12 meters and weighing 330 kilograms,
derives all of its thrust and lift from flapping its wings.
</P>
<P>
A 93-pound woman will pilot the plane at a "secret" airstrip
outside Toronto if all the kinks are sorted out, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
James DeLaurier, a professor at the University of Toronto
Institute for Aerospace Studies, started building models in 1973.
</P>
<P>
A flapping flying machine is finally close to being viable
because DeLaurier and his team developed a computer program to
analyze complex engineering problems presented by ornithopter
flight.
</P>
<P>
The plane will have a pair of wings constructed strong enough
to withstand extraordinary pressure, while keeping light weight
and flexible enough to twist in the corkscrew motion necessary to
sustain flight.
</P>
<P>
Although humans have made smaller ornithopter models fly,
DeLaurier's structure will be the first full-scale, piloted
flapping flying machine to take off, said the newspaper.

YINCHUAN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China is to publish a dictionary
on Xixia, a kingdom established in the 11th century by a number of
ethnic groups in what is now Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in
northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The dictionary will be the largest of its kind concerning
research on the Xixia kingdom which covered Ningxia, Gansu,
Qinghai and part of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The kingdom
was conquered by the Yuan Dynasty in 1227.
</P>
<P>
Xixia was usually considered as a "mysterious kingdom" because
very few historical records on the kingdom remained. So, this
dictionary will be helpful for a systematic study on the subject,
experts in the field said.

More than 20 Chinese scholars have gathered recently in

<HEADLINE> Soybean Milk Plan to Be Promoted in Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A program aimed to improve
nutrition for school children with soybean milk drinking will be
promoted across China, according to today's China Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education will be mainly responsible for the
implementation of the program, called "students' soybean milk plan
".
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition has been a major health problem for the country's
school children, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, nearly 40 percent of the country's school children
suffered from malnutrition and lower weight, and currently the
number of school children with poor nutrition still stands at 270
million.
</P>
<P>
In some parts of the country, the average height of children
aged between 6 to 15 years are 3.3 to six centimeters lower than
the standard, and their average weight was 1.8 to 2.5 kilograms
below the standard, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also show that anemia is another
malnutrition-related health problem. About 38 percent of the
school boys and 37 percent of the girls suffer from the ailment.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problem, four government departments, including
the Ministry of Education, initiated in October 1996 a pilot
soybean action plan in the country's 22 primary and secondary
schools.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen months after the project was carried out, the average
height of the participating children were 0.3 to 0.9 centimeters
higher than that of those who did not drink soybean milk, and
their overall health was improved as a result.

<HEADLINE> N.Z. Industrial Giant on Way to Ending Letter Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Fletcher Challenge Group (FCL),
a New Zealand industrial giant, has moved closer to dismantling
its letter stocks with the announcement of a five billion NZ
dollar (2.5 billion U.S. dollar) cash-for-shares sale of Fletcher
Paper to Norwegian printing paper giant Norske Skog, the Dominion
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made Monday night in Auckland, the biggest
city in New Zealand. The move paves the way for dismantling
unpopular letter-stocks structure of the four divisions of
Building, Paper, Forests and Energy set up by former FCL Chief
Executive Hugh Fletcher in 1993 under the umbrella of the
corporate Fletcher Challenge Group. Though listed separately,
their performances are still consolidated into one group.
</P>
<P>
Fletcher Paper operates in New Zealand, Australia, Asia, South
America and Canada. The biggest sale in New Zealand's corporate
history signals the end of a business started in 1952.
</P>
<P>
The sale, subject to approval by all FCL shareholders, the vote
of Norske Skog's Corporate Assembly (an independent body to the
board) and to regulatory approvals, is expected to be completed by
early July.
</P>
<P>
The purchase of Fletcher Paper will make Norske Skog the second
largest manufacturer of newsprint in the world, lifting its
ranking from fourth.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper quoted FCL Chairman Roderick
Deane as saying Monday night that he was hopeful the other letter-
stock divisions will be separated into their own entities by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The four Fletcher stocks make up about 6.5 percent of the
benchmark NZSE 40 capital index.

BUENOS AIRES, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Paraguayan Foreign Minister
Juan Esteban Aguirre announced Monday that his country is set to
negotiate concrete points of vehicle-trading rules within the
Southern Common Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
A Paraguayan delegation will bring up at a meeting of Common
Market Group (GMC), Mercosur's executive body, a new defining of
regional tariffs for vehicles, said Esteban.
</P>
<P>
He explained taxing 35 percent for imports from countries
outside the body, collected by Argentina and Brazil on March 23,
has rather a fiscal than a productive impact.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister hopes that consensus will be reached among
the body's four members concerning the system of vehicle trading.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur is made up of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay,
with Bolivia and Chile as associate members.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien met Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region Tung Chee Hwa here Monday to discuss a wide
range of issues involving economic, financial and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Canada and Hong Kong have an opportunity to improve future ties
and opportunities by forming a meaningful relationship, Tung told
a press conference after a meeting on Parliament Hill.
</P>
<P>
The two sides enjoy a genuinely "human relationship" with half
a million Hong Kong Chinese becoming Canadians and 150,000
Canadians making Hong Kong their home, according to the chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
"I think future opportunities for Canadian firms will be found
in Asia, as most of the countries in Asia recover from the
financial turmoil of the last 2.5 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I also think that commercial opportunities for Canadian
companies will increase as a result of China's accession to WTO,"
Tung said, adding that he is very optimistic about China's entry
into the World Trade Organization by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will be an excellent base for Canadian firms that
want to extend their business activities in Asia and on the
mainland of China," he said.
</P>
<P>
As one of the most important trading and commercial centers in
the world, Hong Kong has become the 13th largest export market for
Canada, which, in turn, is Hong Kong's 11th importer.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Tung also met with Canadian Finance
Minister Paul Martin and Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy on the
issues of common interests.
</P>
<P>
Tung said he was happy to visit Canada for the first time in
his capacity as the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Canada for the United States Wednesday, Tung is
scheduled to address the Hong Kong-Canada Business Association in
Toronto Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tung arrived in Toronto Saturday to begin his four-day visit.
Chinese Ambassador Mei Ping met Tung at the Toronto airport.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia to Improve Ecology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China is to allocate over 20
billion yuan (about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars) for some ten
ecological projects in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the
first decade of the century.
</P>
<P>
The projects are expected to cover the whole region, and one of
them with an investment of 1.75 billion yuan is to build one
million hectares of forests in the 16 counties near Beijing to
deal with sandstorms.
</P>
<P>
The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is sometimes referred to
as the backyard of Beijing in terms of ecological protection.
</P>
<P>
Ecologist Zou Liejie said that it will take ten years for the
region to set up a forest band to bring back blue sky and
greengrass to the region as well as to the capital.
</P>
<P>
Sand swept Beijing three times last month, with sandstorms in
north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as one of the main
factors.
</P>
<P>
People used to think that northern Hebei province played a key
role in Beijing's environmental conditions. However, the mud rain
in Beijing in April 1998 due to the sand storm in Inner Mongolia
made the country realize the region's key role in this regard.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, central government's efforts have been
effective in the region. Afforestation has helped put over three
million hectares of farmland and pasture under protection, and 24
percent of water and soil erosion area has been under control.
</P>
<P>
Yet, statistics show that 60 percent of the region's 1.18
million sq. km. land is still suffering from desertification, with
an expansion rate of about 600,000 hectares per year.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Wild ducks have reappeared on a
border river between China and the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea, after having vanished for many years.
</P>
<P>
There are now tens of thousands of wild ducks and other
waterfowl to be seen on the Yalu River, said Cao Renjiang, an
official with the environmental protection bureau of Dandong City,
located on the river.
</P>
<P>
Flocks of wild ducks appear only in safe places with clean
water and enough food, he said. "This shows that the environment
along the River has been greatly improved," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The number of wild ducks has increased following the
establishment of a nature reserve centered on the outfalls of the
Yalu and Dayang rivers in 1997.

TAIYUAN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A wooden pagoda built in 1056 in
north China's Shanxi Province is facing the same problem as the
Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy.
</P>
<P>
The pagoda is leaning northeastward, due to earthquakes, wind
and rain, wars, and structural changes. Besides, some of its
wooden columns are broken or split.
</P>
<P>
The octagonal pagoda, named the Ying Xian Mu Ta, is the tallest
existing wooden tower dedicated to the Buddha in China. The nine-
story tower is 67.31 m high. It is 115 years older and 12.81
meters taller than the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen experts on cultural heritage protection, ancient
architecture, wood and steel structures, and seismology have

</P>
<P>
A geological survey of the area has been completed, and all the

<HEADLINE> Interview: Chinese Wushu in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By sportswriter Zhao Yi
</P>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Many Ethiopians say that they
have so many things to learn from China. And among them, Master
Wondimu Belihu said that Wushu, which was also called Chinese
Kongfu, is what he wants to learn from China and to promote in
Ethiopia in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
Wondimu, 40, is the founder and president of the Ethio-Li
Lianjie Chinese Wushu Union. He is well-known among the sport
circle in Ethiopia not only because of his good understanding and
practice of Chinese Wushu, but also due to the fact that he is the
first person to teach his countrymen Chinese martial art.
</P>
<P>
Together with his collegues, Wondimu has currently established
10 Wushu training centers throughout the country, seven in Addis
Ababa, and the remianing in far northern town of Bahir Dar, and in
Awasa and Jima with the former situated in some 250km south of the
capital and the latter about 300km southwest of the metropolis.
</P>
<P>
"We started from 20 members and have admitted 650 people into
the union, including 58 women members and 72 school boys and girls
under 15 years old since the Wushu union was lauched on March 29,
1998.
</P>
<P>
"The union members are so interested in Wushu training that our
training centers are full of trainees from six o'clock in the
morning to eight at night," Wondimu said proudly.
</P>
<P>
Refering to his reasons to establish the Wushu union, Wondimu
said excitedly that "Chinese Wushu is a marvellous sport which
left me a very deep impression when I was a child," noting of all
Chinese Wushu schools, Shaolin Wushu is his most favorite.
</P>
<P>
"I used to major in Wushu in Beijing, China in 1975 for four
years. Ever since that period of study, I made up my mind to
introduce Chinese Wushu to Ethiopia."
</P>
<P>
In addition to holding often Wushu seminars and giving
performances in the capital and various parts of Ethiopia, Wondimu
has so far published two books about Chinese martial arts. One is
"Chinese Wushu Secret", the other is "Chinese Qigong (a system of
deep breathing exercises) and Curing Diseases".
</P>
<P>
The two books are very much welcome at the market with the
total number of 50,000 of copies having been made by publishers,
he said.
</P>
<P>
To offer Wushu fans an easy access to the sport, Wondimu said,
some 50 union members are under training free of charge after they
were found too poor to pay membership fees. "Wushu must be for the
people not for money," the master stressed.
</P>
<P>
Being a master of Wushu, Wondimu has been very serious about
the exercise for decades. "Practise Wushu has become part of my
daily life. Regardless wind and rain, I always get up at five o'
clock in the morning for a two-hour Wushu exercises."
</P>
<P>
Because of his example, Wondimu's four-year-old son, who is
living in the United States, has also become interest in Chinese
Wushu and has started practising simple part of the game,
according to the master.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of his future plan about the Wushu union, Wondimu
disclosed that his union is doing everything to prepare an
international Wushu competition scheduled for November 2001 in
Amenia.
</P>
<P>
"We are under procedure to invite Wushu coaches from China to
give us coaching. We have also started preparing for the 2004
Olympic Games because Wushu has been officially accepted by the
International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
"However, my biggest wish is to devote all my life to promote
Chinese Wushu in my motherland," Wondimu said, noting "I feel half
of my body belongs to China because I really love Chinese Wushu."

<HEADLINE> Tel Aviv Considers Biding for 2012 Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Tel Aviv showed its
intention to make a bid for hosting the 2012 Olympic Games,
sources in the city's municipality revealed Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai announced the desire at a news
conference, in which he also unveiled an architectural model for a
potential Olympic project, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Local International Olympic Committee (IOC) members attended
the conference to endorse Tel Aviv's possible bid.
</P>
<P>
The cost of hosting the Olympics would amount to 9.6 billion U.
S. dollars, with most of it covering massive infrastructure
constructing, such as a new subway system in the city.
</P>
<P>
Some observers pointed out that the Olympics had never been
held in a Middle East country, which increases the hope for Tel
Aviv's success.
</P>
<P>
However, according to these observers, the critical issue would
be the progress of the Middle East peace process. If there will be
peace deals between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the bid would
be possible attractive.
</P>
<P>
If the process was still in stalemate at the time of IOC making
final decision, Tel Aviv's chance would be slim as it would
encounter possible boycott by some Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The host of 2008 Olympic Games has not been decided by IOC. Ten
contenders, including Beijing, Bangkok, Cairo, Havana, Istanbul,
Kuala Lumpur, Osaka, Paris, Seville, Toronto, had submitted their
applications.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 Olympics would be held in Sydney, Australia this
summer, and Athens had already been confirmed as the host for 2004
Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Genocide Survivors Need Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- It is necessary to establish a
compensation fund to assist over 800,000 Rwandan genocide
survivors, Rwanda News Agency quoted officials as saying on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There is need for a compensation fund to be in place as soon
as possible," said Jean de Dieu mucyo, minister of Justice and
Institutional Relations.
</P>
<P>
"The genocide survivors have not yet had full justice done,
since none of them has been compensated for the past five years,"
said Frederick Mutagwera, president of the Genocide Survivors
Association.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, the government had tried to assist genocide
survivors by treating genocide survivors with severe injuries,
bringing about 25,000 children to schools and building houses for
survivors.
</P>
<P>
Rwandans began a week-long commemoration last Saturday to mark
the sixth anniversary of the genocide led by Hutu extremists in
April 1994 which claimed over 800,000 lives of Tutsis and moderate
Hutus.

<HEADLINE> Tel Aviv Stock Index Up Against "Microsoft Shock" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Tel Aviv Stock Exchange
(TASE) registered moderate gains Tuesday in the shadow of the U.S.
court ruling that Microsoft Corp. violated the antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
After a volatile day of trading, the Tel Aviv 100 index closed
up 1.02 percent to 498.91 points, and the blue-chip Maof index (Tel
Aviv 25) rose by 1.25 percent to 505.81 points.
</P>
<P>
Most TASE analysts breathe a sigh of relief after the close,
comparing the gains with the continuous diving of the Nasdaq
composite index in the U.S. and some other stock markets in other
parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
The technology-dominated Nasdaq plunged below 4,000-point
psychological line on Tuesday, its first time in two months,
because of market shocks of the Microsoft ruling.
</P>
<P>
The ruling issued on Monday decided that the software giant
founded by Bill Gates "maintained its monopoly power by anti-
competitive means," and attempted to monopolize the web browser
market.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson also ruled that a
new round of rulings should be held to determine punishment to
impose on Microsoft, including the question of whether the company
should be broken up.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Microsoft shares had lost nearly 15 percent of
its value. It led to market panic and dragged down all stock price
indices in the world.
</P>
<P>
TASE, widely regarded as another hi-tech shares center and
having many similarities with Nasdaq, also could not turn a blind
eye to the market reactions.
</P>
<P>
Thus, local analysts warned, Tuesday's gains simply don't mean
the crisis is over as long as the hi-tech shares, especially those
of the Internet start-ups, are still irrationally overvalued.
</P>
<P>
Most Internet companies never earn money and some even posted
large cash losses. Their share prices go up not because of their
economic achievement, but because of a flow of hot money from
amateur investors, according to these analysts.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out the Tel Aviv 100 broke the 500 barrier and is
16 percent below its level of March 5 (586 points). Maof also lost
nearly 9 percent in less than a month while the Teltech index of
technology stocks has fallen a total of 30 percent since the
beginning of March.
</P>
<P>
All the market indicators ominously predicted an even bigger
crash in the near future, an analyst warned.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Determined to Continue Fighting Organized Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is determined to keep
intensive crackdown on organized crime and drug smuggling, a high-
ranking official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Emin Arslan, chief in charge of fighting organized crime in
Turkey, made the remarks at the conference on the Struggle Against
Smuggling and Organized Crime held in Turkey's southern city of
Antalya, Turkey's Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A total of 110 police chiefs from 81 provinces of the country
attended the conference. Arslan said that the organized criminal
groups have thrived in areas with authority vacuum.
</P>
<P>
He said that the police forces in Turkey did a good job in
catching criminals, but failed to eradicate the financial sources
of these organizations.
</P>
<P>
"Financial sources feed these organizations and help them grow.
We have to confiscate their financial sources in order to eradicate
them. Unfortunately, we fail to do this in Turkey," Arslan said.
</P>
<P>
The chief said that some imprisoned criminal groups' heads still
run their criminal activities by giving instructions from prisons,
adding that these people must be isolated with the outside world.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges Israel to Punish Killers of 2 Jordanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has urged Israel to punish the
suspected killers of two Jordanians in an explosion at a hotel in
the Israeli port city of Eilat 10 days ago, Foreign Minister Abdel
Ilah al-Khatib said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government has officially requested Israel to
inform the kingdom of the outcome of the ongoing investigations
into the case in which Mohammad Abdullah Yassin and Murad Abdel
Karim were killed at the Etzion Hotel on March 26.
</P>
<P>
Both victims were Jordanian nationals but had been working
illegally in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Israel said that police have arrested three Israeli
suspects who were believed to have masterminded the explosion over
an alleged money dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side believed there are some 40,000 Jordanians
living or working illegally in the Jewish state, mostly in cities
and towns with a significant Arab population.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Israel signed a historical peace treaty in 1994, but
no agreement on the movement of labor force between the two
countries has been signed.
</P>
<P>
However, the two countries signed a minor and pilot agreement
last month, under which Israel will permit daily 200 Jordanians
from Jordan's southern port city of Aqaba to cross the border and
work in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The project is set to begin by the end of April or early May,
and Israeli officials said if the project goes well, it will be
expanded to other areas of Jordan.

<HEADLINE> EU Wants to Forge Strategic Partnership With Africa: Portuguese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) wants to "
establish a new strategic partnership" with Africa through the
first Africa-Europe summit, a Portuguese official said here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We, Europeans, do not want to get anything from Africa except
establishment of a new partnership to promote the governance and
stability of Africa," Neviz Fernandos, spokesman for the Portuguese
delegation, told Xinhua after the end of the summit.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day summit under the aegis of the EU and the
Organization of African Unity, leaders of 67 African and EU
countries discussed economic, political and social issues in Africa
and seek close cooperation between the two regions in tackling the
issues.
</P>
<P>
Portugal is currently holding EU's rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
Fernandos, meanwhile, said development and stability in Africa
will be attained through the actions and efforts of the Africans
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the significance of the summit, he said it lies in
the sheer fact that it has taken place. The participation of EU
countries in the summit demonstrated their interest in and
commitment to Africa, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, some countries announced to contribute to the
debt relief process, Fernandos said.
</P>
<P>
Germany has said it would write off 350 million U.S. dollars of
debts of some poor countries. France and Morocco have also
announced to write off debts of a number of poor countries in
coming years.
</P>
<P>
The summit has established a new institutionalized process which
will be fruitful and lead to better relations between the two
continents and improvement of governance in Africa, the Portuguese
official said.
</P>
<P>
The African and EU countries have decided to create a follow-up
mechanism with further summits "based on the principle of
continuity," the next one to be held in Europe in 2003, with a
meeting of ministers in between.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ready to Upgrade Jordan's Defense Capabilities: Cohen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen told reporters here Tuesday that Washington is
interested in upgrading Jordan's defense capabilities while
contributing to the economic development of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his meeting with Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel
Rauf Rawabdeh, Cohen said both Jordan and the United States are
working for the improvement of bilateral ties, and Washington is
ready to help Jordan upgrade its 100,000-strong armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Cohen stressed both Jordan and the U.S. believe Jordan's ability
should be upgraded to defend its own security and stability as the
kingdom takes peace and cooperation as its corner stone in its
foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
The United States provided some 300 million U.S. dollars in
various military and economic packages to Jordan in 1999 to reward
its role as a peace broker between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, becoming the
second Arab country after Egypt to strike a peace deal with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the U.S. provided Amman with fighter planes,
tanks, armored vehicles, anti-air missiles, night-vision equipment
and other sophisticated weapons as part of its efforts to help the
modernization drive of the Jordanian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
On his talks with Rawabdeh, Cohen said both sides agreed that
the Middle East countries should work together for a just, durable
and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also briefed Jordanian officials on his talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak.
</P>
<P>
He discussed with the Jordanian side the peace process
developments on the Syrian track after a summit in Geneva earlier
this month between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Syrian failed to
fix a time to resume the Syrian-Israeli peace talks, which was
derailed in January.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said Jordan and the U.S. are working together for peace
and to lay down the foundations of stability in the region, and
partnership between the U.S. and Jordan has reached an
unprecedented level over the peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived in Amman earlier in the day for a two-day visit as
part of his 12-day regional tour, which has taken him to Nigeria,
Egypt, Israel and will take him to six Gulf states over military
cooperation, bilateral ties and the peace process in the Middle
East.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
on Tuesday met with visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
over the latest developments in the Middle East peace process and
the defense needs of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed the situation in the region after a
Geneva summit earlier this month between U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Syrian President Hafez Assad failed to agree on the
resumption of the Syrian-Israeli peace talks, which was deadlocked
again in January.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Abdullah and Cohen stressed the need for a
just, durable and comprehensive peace in the region, Jordan's
official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, a soldier before his acceding to the throne in
February 1999, also discussed with Cohen the military cooperation
between the two countries, Petra said.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Washington provided some 300 million U.S. dollars in
various military and economic packages to Jordan to reward the
kingdom's role as a major peace broker in the region between Israel
and its Arab neighbors since it signed a peace treaty with Israel
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has also provided advanced fighter planes, tanks,
armored vehicles, anti-aircraft missiles in recent years to Jordan
to help it modernize its 100,000-strong armed forces.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's talks, Abdullah expressed his appreciation for
the U.S. efforts to bring all parties concerned to achieve the
required targets of the peace process under international laws and
relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The monarch also expressed satisfaction over the current U.S.-
Jordanian relations in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived here earlier in the day for a two-day visit as
part of his 12-day regional tour, which has taken him to Nigeria,
Egypt, Israel and will take him to six Gulf states for talks on
bilateral military cooperation and the Middle East peace process.

Jordan takes peace and cooperation as the corner stone of its
foreign policies after it signed a peace treaty with Israel in
1994. It supports efforts by all parties to achieve a just, durable
and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Patten stressed that the EU is not only a major partner of the
peace process in the region, but also a major supplier of
development and non-military aid to the region.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU attaches importance to strengthening cultural,
trade and economic cooperation with countries in the region within
the framework of the European-Mediterranean Partnership agreement.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Amman, Patten and Jordanian officials signed
four agreements under a 129-million-euro (126.4 million U.S.
dollars) aid package to the kingdom in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The package included 80 million Euro (78.4 million dollars) aid
for the Jordanian budget and its economic reform program, 40
million euro (39.2 million dollars) for updating its industrial
frameworks.
</P>
<P>
The package also included a 3.9 million euro (3.8 million
dollars) for the development of tourist and antiquity sites, which
as a key foreign currency earner brought in some 900 million U.S.
dollars to the kingdom in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Central Bank Consolidates International Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Central Bank's process
of consolidating its hard currency reserves continued in March,
which are worth 1,632.5 million U.S. dollars, up 67.3 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold reserve amounted to 103.6 tons but its value
diminished to 919.2 million U.S. dollars because of the evolution
of international prices.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the international reserves (hard currency plus gold) are
worth over 2.5 billion U.S. dollars in Romania's Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Until the end of the year, payments which are due on account of
domestic in hard currency and foreign public debt are of 998
million U.S. dollars. Out of this debt, guaranteed by the Romanian
Finance Ministry, hard currency T-bonds issued in the domestic
market are worth 186 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank continues to consolidate its reserves and to
ensure the service of foreign public debt.

<HEADLINE> Britain Cracks Down on Asylum Seekers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Asylum seekers found begging in
Britain will have their claims fast tracked, the Home Office
confirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
When police pick up asylum seekers for begging, immigration
officials will be contacted immediately and they will carry out an
interview as a priority.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office said asylum seekers will be given five days to
make their case before an initial decision. They will then be
given a further four weeks to appeal.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw said asylum seekers should not get
involved in practices such as aggressive begging.
</P>
<P>
"I agree that we need to treat asylum seekers, founded and
unfounded, in a decent civilized way. We need to be careful about
language," the BBC quoted Straw as saying.
</P>
<P>
"But I also say that asylum seekers themselves do have a
responsibility to recognize that they are coming to a civilized
country and they have duties in terms of their own behavior," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Immigration Minister Barbara Roche revealed freight trains were
the latest route to be exploited by organized gangs of "people
smugglers."
</P>
<P>
But asylum seekers were risking death trying to enter the UK on
freight trains, highlighted by the death of two Romanians who were
electrocuted, she said.
</P>
<P>
Last year more than 800 asylum seekers were detected in railway
wagons. At least two died en route when they tried to break out of
the carriages and were electrocuted by overhead wires.
</P>
<P>
The asylum seekers mainly from Romania are smuggled aboard
trains in northern Italy. Officials said 834 people were
discovered in freight containers last year but it is estimated
that up to 2,500 illegal immigrants used the railways as a route
into the UK.

<HEADLINE> Translator's Error Destroyed Italy's Ancient Abbey in WWII, Book Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The most controversial Allied act in
the Italian campaign in World War II, the destruction of the
ancient Benedictine abbey of Montecassino south of Rome, was a
mistake due to a translator's error, according to a book about to
be published.
</P>
<P>
The book, written by Sir. Rupert Clark, the then-adjutant of
deputy Allied Forces chief General Harold Alexander, claims a
British secret service agent mistranslated an innocuous message
saying "the abbot is with the monks in the monastery."
</P>
<P>
The agent took the German word "abt," meaning abbot, to stand
for "abteilung," meaning unit.
</P>
<P>
He therefore informed his superiors that the Germans had broken
an accord with the Vatican and installed their headquarters in the
abbey, which had commanded the surrounding plain from a high hill
ever since Saint Benedict himself chose the spot in 529.
</P>
<P>
According to former adjutant Sir Rupert Clark, whose book "With
Alex At War" was amply excerpted in today's edition of the British
newspaper Guardian, the decision to send in the bombers was
quickly taken.
</P>
<P>
Clark said he heard of the tragic error from secret service
Colonel David Hunt, who asked to see the intercepted message when
the bombers had already taken off. He realized the mistake but it
was too late.
</P>
<P>
On February 15, 1944, three hours of intensive bombing reduced
one of the glories of Christendom to a pile of rubble, killing 250
people in the process.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth time the monastery had been destroyed, after
the Lombards, Saracens and an earthquake. But this time more lives
were lost after the event than during the destruction.
</P>
<P>
The rubble afforded a perfect stronghold for the Germans to
defend. Thousands of Allied soldiers lost their lives before the
bloodied hilltop was captured three months later.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s Montecassino Abbey was rebuilt as it once stood.
Allied governments paid for the project. It is now one of the
biggest tourist attractions between Rome and Naples.

<HEADLINE> Germany Warns Against Far Right Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Although the political influence
of German far right organizations were shrinking, existing far
rightists and neo-nazis were more inclined to violence in the past
year, a report of the German Interior Ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, members of German far right parties and organizations
dropped by 2,200 from the year before to 51,400, but the number of
"skinheads," the most violent and dangerous section of the far-
right extremists, grew by 10 percent to 9,000, the annual report
of the German Constitution Protection Office said.
</P>
<P>
"I have to project that the number of violence-intending far
right extremists will be stable at a high level, in correspondence
with a higher violent tendency of far right extremist scenes,"
said German Interior Minister Otto Schily at a press conference
presenting the report.
</P>
<P>
There were 746 cases of far right violent offenses, a 5.4-
percent increase against 1998, while the total cases of far right
offenses dropped by 9.2 per cent, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"Yet, they cannot organize any terrorist structure, nor have
they any political concept of an armed war against the state,"
said Schily.
</P>
<P>
"The far right organizations again and again advocated
violence, weapons were again and again found in their scenes, but
many people think this can only lead to more pressure of the state
and make their political work harder -- clearly they have lost the
power to convince."
</P>
<P>
As a proof, far right political parties were losing voters
although they played some media show-offs, and some parties were
splitting, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The German People Union (DVU), the strongest far right
political party with 17,000 members, is weakening in internal
quarrels after it entered the Brandenburg state parliament last
year.
</P>
<P>
Another extremist party, the Republicans, failed to collect 5
percent of vote to enter a parliament in any local election in
1999.
</P>
<P>
But, both the report and the minister noted that far right
organization were deploying popular media, such as pop bands ,
music CD, and Internet, to attract younger followers.
</P>
<P>
The report said, there were 93 so-called "skinhead bands,"
which played 109 "skinhead concerts" and published "skinhead music
CDs" in 1999, and in Internet, the number of "skinhead music" in
popular MP3 format, was rising.
</P>
<P>
"That makes them (the far right organizations) so dangerous,"
stressed Schily, adding that although the authorities had carried
out "numerous searches and confiscations," these activities
remained at high level.
</P>
<P>
The far right organizations were eager deploying Internet as
their propaganda channel, said the report, quoting there were more
than 330 far right extremist homepages in the World Wide Web (WWW)
while in 1998 the number was only 200.
</P>

<HEADLINE> West African Gas Pipeline Officials Stress Environment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the trans-national West
African Gas Pipeline project pledged on Tuesday that they would
take comprehensive environmental considerations when carrying out
the project.
</P>
<P>
Pan African News Agency quoted the officials as saying in
Ghana's capital Accra that it would be one of the worst things
governments would do to render millions of people vulnerable to
known and unknown environmental defects.
</P>
<P>
The project's public affairs manager, Esther Cobbah, of the
Togolese Environmental Protection Agency, said that some
precedents of environmental discrepancies with similar projects
was persuasive enough for the governments to prevent such
disasters.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of the project, she said it was
impossible to achieve energy security if the countries concerned
let natural gas continue to be flared in Nigeria while resorting
to buy expensive fuel from outside the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
"What we need now is for all of us in Ghana, Nigeria, Togo and
Benin to unite to see this project come to pass for our own
benefit and that of our children," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
The project, designed to transmit natural gas from Nigeria to
Benin, Ghana, and Togo, is a key element in the energy common pool
regime in the Economic Community of West African States.

<HEADLINE> Polenz Nominated German CDU General Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A new face emerged in the leading
circle of the German opposite Christian Democratic Union (CDU)
when Ruprecht Polenz was formally nominated as the party's general
secretary Tuesday evening here.
</P>
<P>
Polenz, 53 and a legislator in the German parliament Bundestag,
will be recommended to the CDU federal congress next week to
replace Angela Merkel, who is set to be elected party leader.
</P>
<P>
At a CDU presidium meeting, Merkel chose Polenz to the key
post for party management. Under the CDU party rule, Merkel has
the power to nominate the general secretary.
</P>
<P>
The nomination won "favorable support" from the party
presidium, Merkel told a press conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"He will take the challenge to make the CDU a great middle
party of people," said Merkel. "His previous experiences show that
he understands the modern form of communication."
</P>
<P>
Polenz, who called his new job "hard and full of challenge,"
said he would bring "inner-party democracy" to the conservative
CDU, and would make the party "powerful" before the general
election in 2002.
</P>
<P>
"The CDU must turns its ears to the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Polenz was born in Saxonia and moved to the western German
city of Muenster with his family. He worked 14 years as a lawyer
with the Muenster Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 he was elected to the Bundestag as a CDU liberal
winger, and has been responsible for the foreign and security
policy of the CDU parliamentary section.
</P>
<P>
The media and CDU officials depicted Polenz as "hard-working,
serious and talented." His top job is to settle the party finance,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The CDU faces debts of up to 100 million marks, based on old
debts of 25 million marks and adding tens of millions of fines
linked to Kohl's illegal funding scandal.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa Hails Visit to Canada Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Toronto, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of China, said
here Tuesday that he has made "a wonderful visit" to Canada, which
he believes will refocus its attention in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"I must say I had a wonderful visit, a very warm welcome.
Discussion with the prime minister was very useful and productive.
</P>
<P>
"I also had opportunity to see the finance minister and the
foreign minister," Tung told reporters about his first visit to
Canada in the capacity as the chief executive of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
"In our discussions, we noticed the prospects of China's
joining WTO" and Hong Kong's economic recovery, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also noticed "that with the recovery of the Asian
economy, it is time Canadian companies should refocus attention in
Asia. There will be great deal opportunities out there," he said
confidently.
</P>
<P>
About 100 Canadian companies have branches or subsidiary
operations in Hong Kong, with another 450 being represented by
distibutors, agents or joint ventures in the region.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the 13th largest export market for Canada, which,
in turn, is Hong Kong's 11th importer.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Tung told more than 900 guests at a
business luncheon in the Metro Toronto Convention Center that Hong
Kong's Commission for Strategic Development is planning to make
the city with a status comparable to that of Toronto, New York and
London.
</P>
<P>
In doing so, one of the priorities for Hong Kong is to seek
cooperation in developing clean transport, where "Canada looks to
have some of the most promising technology," according to Tung.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to that developing rapidly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung identified a number of other areas he believes Hong Kong
should look to "places like Canada" for ideas and inspiration,
including education for a knowledge-based economy and the sewage
and waste disposal.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that China's "one country, two systems" policy
has been transformed from a concept into an every reality and is
working well in Hong Kong, which has "a very ambitious program
over the next five to 10 years to achieve a standard comparable to
other cities in the world."
</P>
<P>
"If you wish to expand in Asia, please think of Hong Kong," he
told the Canadian Club of Toronto, the Hong Kong-Canada Business
Association and Hong Kong Toronto Development Council, which
jointly hosted the business luncheon.
</P>
<P>
Tung arrived here Saturday to begin a four-day visit to Canada.
He said he would take with him "a very happy memory" of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa is scheduled to leave for the United States
Wednesday to continue his visit.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Regains Ground After Plunging 574 Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index Tuesday regained ground after plunging 574 points
on rules against Microsoft in an antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
The composite closed down 74.79 at 4,148.89, topping on its
loss of 349.15 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Dow Jones
industrial average fell 57.09 at 11,164.84 and the Standard &AMP; Poor
's 500 index fell 11.24 at 1,494.73.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index plunged as investors became pessimistic about
the future of technology stocks after U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson ruled Monday that Microsoft Corp. has repeatedly
violated antitrust laws. The index lost 574.57 points early in the
session Tuesday before recovering.
</P>
<P>
At its lowest level Tuesday, the Nasdaq was 27 percent below
its record closing high of 5,058.62 set March 10. A drop of 20
percent is defined as a bear market on Wall Street but market
analysts were reluctant to declare that.
</P>
<P>
Investors rushed in the market for bargain-hunting before the
market closed, which rescued the index from a crash. The Nasdaq
recorded a 634 point swing in trading Tuesday, the biggest ever in
its history.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq's steep drop also spurred a big selloff in the
broader market. The Dow Index fell as mush as 503 points from an
early 196 point rise and then regained ground. The 700.46-point
swing from high to low was the biggest on record for the Dow.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 7.36 at 652.30 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 35.48 at 942.52. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 9.90 at 506.12.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a nearly 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,065 up, 2,038 down
and 381 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 1.5 billion shares from 1.02 billion
in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Cardoso Reiterates Support for "One China" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Brazilian President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso reiterated Tuesday here his support of
the policy of "only one China" when he was asked on the aspiration
of certain Taiwan sectors to promote this island's independence.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso emphasized Brazil has "a very clear stance. We
recognize China's aspiration to the existence of only one China
and all of our policy goes in line with this concept."
</P>
<P>
Cardoso said this at a press conference here in company of his
Costa Rican counterpart, Miguel Angel Rodriguez, upon ending a
bilateral meeting.
</P>
<P>
"My vision of Brazil's relations with China in the 21st century
is very simple and direct: 'Brazil considers China as a strategic
partner, with which we have best relations,'" said Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's President arrived Monday night in Costa Rica to attend
Tuesday a bilateral meeting with President Rodriguez and Wednesday
he'll meet the rest of Central America's presidents and Panama's,
as well as Belize's prime minister and the Dominican Republic's
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"Recently I spoke to President Miguel Angel Rodriguez about a
satellite we launched jointly, a Sino-Brazilian satellite.
Actually, there are four satellites, two of which were built in
Brazil and another two in China, but both with technological
exchange," he added.
</P>
<P>
"So we have a very positive vision as regards collaborating
with China, not only in rhetorical terms, but also in very
practical terms," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Likewise, Brazil has been very favorable for the incorporating
of China to the World Trade Organization," he indicated.
</P>
<P>
"We have lots to develop in common," said Brazil's president. "
China has enormous weight, not only in Asia, but also in the rest
of the world. Brazil recognizes this weight, and is very
interested in the rapprochement that already exists and which will
grow."
