<HEADLINE> Chinese Badminton Teams Ready for Thomas, Uber Cups, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- "The Chinese players have got
used to the climate in Hong Kong after the five-day pre-tournament
training and the men's and women's teams are now ready for the
start of the competitions," the head of the Chinese delegation for
the coming Thomas Cup and Uber Cup badminton championships said
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day 20th Thomas Cup and 17th Uber Cup world badminton
team championships Finals open on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Now let's sit down and see how our players can do their job up
there at the courts," said Li Furong, chief de mission of the
Chinese delegation and president of the Chinese Badminton
Association.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were echoed by the Chinese team's head coach Li
Yongbo. "High in moral and without serious injuries, our players
are now in a very good shape," Li said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
And Lu Shengrong, president of the International Badminton
Federation (IBF), said that she was happy and felt settled that
the tournament could at last kick off after financial difficulties
were overcome.
</P>
<P>
With the withdrawal of main sponsors from the championships due
to the recent financial crisis in Southeast Asia, the tournament
came to the verge of being called off or postponed. But IBF, the
sport's world governing body, managed to make it go ahead even
without major corporate funding.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in the championships' history that the
competitions are to be held without major corporate financial
support.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese team is the toughest to deal with in the Thomas
Cup," said Indra Gurawan, the men's singles coach of the defending
champions Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia, China and Denmark are all stronger than the
Malaysians, although I do not mean that the Malaysians are far
behind," said Morten Frost, Denmark's former men's singles world
champion who turned to be the head coach of the Malaysian team
after the last championships in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
His team's goal was to beat South Korea and the Netherlands of
Group B to win a semi-final berth. "I prefer to face Denmark in
the semi-finals," he said.
</P>
<P>
The championships get started on Friday with group competitions
in the Uber Cup. Defending champions Indonesia of Group B play
England, and South Korea face the Netherlands in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In Group A competitions Friday evening, China face Hong Kong,
China, while Denmark take on Japan.
</P>
<P>
Group competitions start on Saturday for the Thomas Cup
tournament.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Invests 300 Million Dollars in S.Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 14 (Xinhua) -- United States telecommunication
giant Motorola Inc. will invest 300 million U.S. dollars in South
Korea within the next three years to expand its business in the
financial crisis-engulfed country.
</P>
<P>
Richard Younts, chief of Motorola's Asia-Pacific Operations,
told a press conference here Thursday that a third of the 300
million dollars will flow into the country this year.
</P>
<P>
"With this announcement, we reaffirmed our confidence in the
resilience of the Korean economy and in the strong determination
of the Korean people to overcome economic adversity, both of which
we have witnessed more than once during our more than 30 year
presence in Korea," Younts said.
</P>
<P>
About half of the 300 million dollars will go to expanding
semiconductor production lines at the Motorola plant in Paju,
north of Seoul, and developing various software and communications
products.
</P>
<P>
The remaining investment will be earmarked for new partnerships
with South Korean telecommunication makers.
</P>
<P>
Motorola has recently added to its successful semiconductor
operations in South Korea with the creation of a cellular products
design center.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Im Bank Halts New India Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Responding to President Bill
Clinton's order to impose sanctions against India for its nuclear
tests, Ex-Im Bank has suspended new guarantees for U.S. firms that
are planning to export goods to India.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in a statement issued Wednesday that it would not
give approval to loans, loan guarantees or credit insurance in
support of U.S. exports to India. "Sanctions take effect
immediately regarding all new business in the public and private
sectors," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The ban could affect 500 million dollars of exports which are
already pending. An additional 3.5 billion dollars of exports
could be affected in the longer term.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley told CNBC's Market Watch
program that the sanctions could have an even more significant
impact on U.S. trade volumes with India.
</P>
<P>
"We in the Department of Commerce have 10 billion dollars worth
of projects in the pipeline that we would be advocating on behalf
of U.S. companies in India," he said. "These projects will very
likely all come to a grinding halt."
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed sanctions order Wednesday after India shocked
the world with five nuclear tests. He said the nuclear tests had
brought "dangerous instability" to South Asia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Price Climbs Up in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. consumer prices
recorded a modest 0.2 percent increase in April, caused largely by
substantial increases in tobacco, lettuce and hotel charges, the
labor Department said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The increase was the largest in the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
in six months, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
For the first four months of the year, the country's inflation
ran at a modest 0.9 percent annual rate. With energy costs
expected to drift higher now, economists predict inflation for the
full year will be about the same as last year's 11-year low of 1.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report Thursday, the department said new
applications for unemployment benefits totaled 307,000 last week,
down by 2,000 from the previous week, which indicates strong
demand for labor.
</P>
<P>
Economists have been studying the price numbers for signs that
brisk economic growth and labor shortages are causing inflation.
But so far, there's been scant evidence.
</P>
<P>
The 1.2 percent increase in the cost of lodging away from home
illustrates the pressure on services, which haven't been much
affected by declining energy costs and competition with cheap
imports from economically troubled East Asia.
</P>
<P>
A 3.8 percent increase in tobacco, the largest in more than 15
years, came as tobacco companies struggled to pay for
multi-billion-dollar liability settlements. And that wasn't the
only contribution to a 0.3 percent increase in so-called core
prices, the price of all items except the volatile food and energy
components.
</P>
<P>
Prescription drug prices rose 0.8 percent in April, helping to
push the cost of medical care overall up by 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
But, even with lettuce, food costs overall rose just 0.1
percent. The price of new cars and trucks was unchanged for the
month and down 1.4 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Airline fares, which rose 8.2 percent during the first three
months of the year, fell 0.3 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
The cost of in-state telephone calls jumped 1.3 percent but
computer prices fell 2.4 percent and cellular telephone services
declined 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
In another report, the department said inventories rose 0.5
percent in March after a big 0.7 percent rise in February. That
would be a sign that businesses are having trouble selling goods,
except that sales are increasing even faster, up 0.6 percent in
March and 0.9 percent in February.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Army Says Ready to Apologize for Any Mistakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI)
Commander Gen. Wiranto said Thursday that if ABRI had made
mistakes in handling recent students rallies, it would not
hesitate to apologize to the people.
</P>
<P>
"ABRI will ask for apology if its officers did something
wrong," the official Antara News Agency quoted the general as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto also said ABRI would surely take action against those
who are proven to have violated the laws and other existing
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said the shooting incident at Trisakti University in
Jakarta on Tuesday in which six students were killed and a score
of others injured would be settled thoroughly in line with
existing legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
The students were killed when they were staging demonstrations,
demanding sweeping political, economic and legal reforms in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The ABRI chief called all strata of society to exercise
self-restraint to avoid further clashes that could claim more
lives.
</P>
<P>
He said ABRI was not happy with the recent social unrest. "All
of us were concerned," he noted.
</P>
<P>
TV Indonesia reported Thursday evening that a number of people
had been wounded and hundreds of shops and buildings in Jakarta
looted or burned by rioters since Wednesday. The rioting was still
going on in some areas of the city.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Britain Discuss Bosnia Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Britain Thursday
held talks on the status of Malaysian peacekeeping troops in
Bosnia-Herzegovina after June this year when the mandate of the
Stabilization Force (SFOR) set up under the Dayton Peace Accord
ends.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Malaysian Defense Minister Syed Hamid and
Chief of Staff of the British Armed Forces Gen. Roger Wheeler here
was crucial because the Malaysian force in the Balkans is under
the operational command of the British military, Syed Hamid told
reporters after the talks.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, which has deployed 790 peacekeepers in the former
Yugoslav state in areas such as Linvo, Glamoc and Kupres, had
announced that only 50 of its peacekeeping soldiers would stay in
Bosnia after the peacekeeping mandate ends, the Malaysian national
news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said Wheeler praised the Malaysian soldiers in
Bosnia-Herzegovina for carrying out their tasks professionally
despite working in a different environment.
</P>
<P>
Bernama said the on-going strife in the Yugoslav autonomous
region of Kosovo and bilateral military cooperation between
Malaysia and Britain, including involvement in the Five Power
Defense Arrangements (FPDA), were also discussed in the talks.
</P>
<P>
FPDA comprises Britain, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia and New
Zealand.

<HEADLINE> Report: Netanyahu, Barak Discuss General Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and opposition Labor leader Ehud Barak met last week and
discussed the holding of general elections later this year, Israel
Radio reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Radio quoted a reliable government source as saying that
the meeting was initiated by Netanyahu and the two met last Friday
night at Netanyahu's Jerusalem residence.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu suggested that the general elections be held in
November this year if the political situation in the country was
out of control and that if a general election was required, the
Radio said.
</P>
<P>
But there has been no comment about this issue from Barak.
</P>
<P>
Neither Netanyahu nor Barak could be reached for confirmation
of the report. Netanyahu is in Washington for talk with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Israel's troop
redeployment in the West Bank and other issues concerning the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel's troop redeployment is the core issue that is
undermining Netanyahu's coalition government. It's right-wing
partners, such as the National Religious Party and Shas Party,
that strongly oppose any further troop pullback from the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The right-wingers threatened they would pull out of the
coalition if Netanyahu handed over more than 9 percent of the West
Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Within the cabinet, the hawkish ministers, National
Infrasructure Minister Ariel Sharon in particular, are pressuring
Netanyahu not to accept the U.S. proposal for a 13.1 percent
Israeli troop withdrawal.

<P>
JAKARTA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A score of rioters attacked the
Jakarta Police Headquarters at Semanggi in the Indonesian capital
on Thursday, the official Antara News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The mobs tried to enter the grounds of the headquarters but
security guards managed to drive them away, said the report.

Although police had fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the
rioters, they kept trying to enter the headquarters' premises.

The anti-riot task force of the Jakarta military command and
the army special force have been deployed but they could do

houses in Glodok area and on Petak Sembilan and Kemenangan streets
and set some of them ablaze.
</P>

MANILA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines Thursday expressed
its "serious concern" over India's nuclear tests and urged New
Delhi to halt its nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippines reiterates its call for an end to nuclear
testing and its call for those nations that have not yet done so
to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Nuclear
Non-proliferation Treaty," the Foreign Department said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Manila "joined the many other nations in the
world in expressing its serious concern" over the nuclear tests
conducted by India and hoped the tests would not adversely affect
confidence and stability in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, President Fidel Ramos' spokesman and Press
Secretary Hector Villanueva also voiced the Philippines' urge for
India to halt its nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
"Our position has been anti-nuclear (weapons) but I think the
proper term is weapon of destruction," he said. "We are against
any form of nuclear testing, consistent with Philippine policy."
</P>

He said his country followed the United States' strong
condemnation of the five nuclear tests in northern India which led
to U.S. economic sanctions against India.

<P>
India has drawn widespread international condemnation after it
conducted five consecutive underground nuclear tests this week.

TEHRAN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Pakistani Deputy Interior
Minister Hafizallah Eshaq Thursday assured Iranian Interior
Minister Abdollah Nouri that Islamabad has taken measures to
punish the attackers of Iranian nationals.
</P>
<P>
Eshaq said "my visit to Tehran is aimed at giving assurance to
you on behalf of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif that the Islamabad
government will pursue the issue until reaching a final result
acceptable to the people and government of Iran," the Iranian
official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Nine Iranian nationals have been killed by unidentified gunmen
in Pakistan since last September. Eshaq expressed regrets over the
terrorist acts against Iranian nationals.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of Iranian government, Nouri voiced deep concern
about the attacks, saying "We regard the security in Pakistan as
our own security and are willing to discuss major regional and
international issues involving the national interests of both
countries, instead of expressing regrets."
</P>
<P>
Nouri urged the incidents be handled as soon as possible,
adding that any delay might strain Tehran-Islamabad ties.
</P>
<P>
He said "it is not acceptable to the Iranian nation and
government that a country with strong military power, intelligence
and security forces is unable to deal with the terrorist attack."
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the terrorists are not punished severely,
they would become bolder and more dangerous.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Senate Condemns Indian Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Senate unanimously
passed a resolution on Thursday condemning India for conducting
five nuclear tests this week.
</P>
<P>
The Senate condemns "the adamant stand of India to continue to
pursue its aggressive designs and lust to acquire nuclear weapons
to establish its hegemony in the region," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
"India's decision to opt for overt nuclearization carries grave
implications for global and regional peace and security," it said.
</P>
<P>
It regrets that Pakistan's repeated warnings about India's
possession of nuclear weapons and its long-standing designs to go
nuclear were not heeded by the international community.
</P>
<P>
The Senate recalls that Pakistan has steadfastly condemned
"international double standards and discriminatory pressures which
were totally unjustified."
</P>
<P>
The consequences arising from India's nuclear tests and
weaponization have dealt "a fatal blow to the global
non-proliferation regime," the Senate said.
</P>
<P>
It also affirms the determination of the Government, the
Opposition Parties and the people of Pakistan "not to submit to
Indian hegemony and to safeguard national security whatever the
costs."
</P>
<P>
The Senate urges the government to work towards a national
consensus based on political harmony and take such steps in
consultation with all major political parties as are necessary to
meet any eventuality arising from the use or threat of use of
nuclear weapons or conventional weapons by India.
</P>
<P>
The Senate supports the government in its firm resolve to
reject any unilateral or discriminatory pressures from any quarter
on matters pertaining to Pakistan's national security, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan said that
by conducting the nuclear tests India has struck a fatal blow to
international efforts at nuclear non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
"The international community's wish to create a nuclear-weapons
free world is totally shattered. The responsibility rests squarely
with India," he said.
</P>
<P>
The security situation in South Asia has now radically changed,
said Ayub Khan, adding that "obviously, Pakistan cannot remain
oblivious to this perilous development."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's security "is our paramount concern, and it will not
be compromised at any cost," he said.

<P>
He was responding to a motion introduced in parliament by
member of parliament Richard Shambambeva-Nyandoro calling on the
government to convey Zimbabwe's appreciation and admiration for
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan over his handling of the Iraqi
arms inspection crisis, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said the crisis which Annan defused bore potential
seeds of a disastrous war with dire consequences for peace and
stability in the already volatile Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
"We admire his commitment to the service of mankind and urge
him to persevere in his labors in search of peace and justice the
world over," said Mudenge.
</P>
<P>
"It is our sincere hope that the agreement will pave the way
for the establishment of lasting peace and stability in the
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, it should be noted that, at the
request of the Iraqi government, the U.N. chief delivered a
message to the U.N. Security Council pertaining to the acute
suffering being experienced by ordinary Iraqi citizens as a
consequence of the current U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"The lessons we have learnt here is that sanctions should be
time-framed, targeted and not open-ended if we are to avoid
inflicting undue pain and suffering on the innocent population,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that sanctions should never be used as a weapon in
the interest of any member country for toppling legitimate
governments for ideological or other reasons.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Mudenge said, imposing sanctions that constrain
Libyans from observing religious duties hinders them from
offering humanitarian assistance to fellow Africans in need or
puts obstacles in Libya's way when fulfilling its OAU
obligations, is not right or fair and must come to an end now.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft to Delay Win 98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. has agreed to hold
back on the shipment of Windows 98 while settlement talks with the
U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys generals are still
under way.
</P>
<P>
Sources who reached the public Thursday morning said that the
parties held the 11th negotiations earlier Thursday concerning a
major Sherman Antitrust case that was about to be launched against
the software giant. Microsoft Corp. is making a last minute offer
to settle the charges.
</P>
<P>
However, it is said, that a suit could still be filed unless
Microsoft is willing to make "serious concessions" and changes in
its business practices.
</P>
<P>
NBC News reported Wednesday that the Justice Department and at
least 19 states plan to file historic antitrust cases Thursday
against Microsoft. If they proceed, the suits could be among the
biggest corporate challenges in history, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft originally planned to ship its new Windows 98
operating system in PC to retailers Friday, and put it on shelves
of computer stores on June 25. Its critics would like to see a
court block the planned public release. To them, the company
purposely embedded a Web brower into the new software which they
claim is designed to enslave the entire Internet-using public to
Microsoft's will.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Deplores India's Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
strongly deplores the three underground nuclear tests by India on
May 11 and its two further tests on May 13 despite overwhelming
international concern and protests, it said in a presidential
statement issued after a council session here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Expressing its concern at the effects of this development on
peace and stability in South Asia, the council urges India to
refrain from any further tests.
</P>
<P>
The council maintains that such testing is contrary to the de
facto moratorium on the testing of nuclear weapons or other
nuclear explosive devices, and to global efforts towards nuclear
non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Affirming the crucial importance of the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty, the council appeals to India and all other
non-signatories to become parties to them without delay and
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that to prevent an escalation in the arms
race, particularly in nuclear weapons and their delivery systems,
and to preserve peace in the region, the council urges U.N. member
states "to exercise maximum restraint."
</P>
<P>
The council underlines that the sources of tension in South
Asia "should only be resolved through dialogue and not by military
build-up."

<HEADLINE> A Lebanese Woman Wounded in Israeli Shelling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 14 (Xinhua) -- After air raiding eastern Lebanon's
Bekaa Valley Wednesday, Israeli troops Thursday shelled the
central part of Nabatiya, leaving one woman wounded, Lebanon's
National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The woman sustained slight wounds when she was hit by shrapnels
of Israeli shells landed at the district of al Manzili in
Nabatiya, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The shelling came as a retaliation for a Hezbollah offensive on
two Israeli posts inside its self-styled security zone earlier in
the day.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a
guerrilla war to end Israeli occupation of south Lebanon where it
set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in 1985 after two
invasions.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Israeli warplanes launched the deadliest and
deepest thrusts into Lebanon in more than two years, bombing a
camp of the radical Palestinian guerrillas of the Fatah-Uprising
in Bekaa, near the Syrian border.
</P>
<P>
The group is a dissident faction from the mainstream Fatah
Movement led by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. At least 10
Palestinians, including six of the group's fighters, were killed
and 27 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The raids were interpreted by Lebanese media as a "reasonable
reason intentionally offered" by Israelis for Palestinian fighters
for carrying out suicide bombings inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
If things go like this, it would in turn justify Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's rejection of the American proposal
of 13.1 percent troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is in the United States and will hold the second
meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on the American
ideas aimed at reviving the Middle East peace process. Their first
meeting Wednesday, however, failed to produce any result.

<HEADLINE> 90 Percent French Families Own Financial Heritage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Nine out of 10 families of France own
at least one financial heritage and about 60 percent of households
in France own their own houses or apartments, said the official
statistics office INSEE Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The number of French families which own no heritage at all only
makes up 6.3 percent of the total, as compared with 10 percent in
1976.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 9 percent of French families are investing in several
fields to get rich -- bank savings, real estates, life insurances,
stocks and other credits, as compared with 6 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The French way of saving and getting rich has greatly changed
during the 1990s, as more families are buying stocks, although 80
percent of the households always maintain a bank saving.
</P>
<P>
Families of aged couples prefer to have long-term savings such
as investment in life insurance and real estate properties, while
families consisting of younger couples often buy short-term saving
credits from banks.
</P>
<P>
Fewer French young people can obtain their own houses before 40
than their parents, and 23 percent of the people who have bought
their houses or apartments remain in debt.

<HEADLINE> India Left Parties, Organizations Condemn Nuke Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Indian left parties and some
organizations have condemned India's decision to conduct nuclear
tests on Monday and Wednesday, saying the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP)-led government was motivated by its own concerns other than
the country's security.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of India (Marxism) (CPI-M) said on Thursday
that in exercising the nuclear option, the BJP-led government was
obviously guided by its strident jingoism which dovetails with its
ideological outlook.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that the (Prime Minister) Vajpayee government
take all the parties and the people into confidence before making
any major departure on policy matters which are vital to the
country's interests," the CPI-M politburo said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement criticized the government for conducting five
nuclear tests in quick succession without consultation with
political parties and people.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of India (CPI) said "the government is
deviating from some of the accepted positions on India's nuclear
policy."
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of India (Marxism-Leninism), meanwhile,
said the nuclear tests showed the Indian government was pursuing a
"short-sighted" policy.
</P>
<P>
The Congress Party urged the government to explain to the
people about the change in security perceptions by it in the last
two months which prompted it to go ahead with a series of nuclear
blasts.
</P>
<P>
The Congress Working Committee began a meeting here on Thursday
to take stock of the political situation particularly in the light
of the nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Ex-Army Officers' Association of India is of the view that the
BJP had timed the nuclear tests to divert public attention from
non-governance and mismanagement of the coalition parties.
</P>
<P>
The association condemned the government's decision to carry
out the tests, which the ex-officers fear would trigger a nuclear
arms race in the sub-continent.
</P>
<P>
A statement by Greenpeace, which is "outraged at India's
decision to carry out the tests, said India must receive a clear
message from the international community that any nuclear testing
was unacceptable and that no further tests would be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
"Rather than increasing its security, these tests made India
and the region more insecure," said the statement, which was
issued in Amsterdam and conveyed from its Delhi office.
</P>
<P>
"The Indian government has made a costly mistake if it believes
that domestic support of these facts is worth the increase in
insecurity in the region and globally," it said.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued by Indian religious organizations said
the poverty and underdevelopment in the sub-continent makes it
particularly imperative that the region's scientific and other
resources and energies are focussed sharply on ameliorating the
lot of the people.
</P>
<P>
The statement was signed on behalf of the Indian Justice and
Peace Commission, the Catholic Bishops Conference of India, and
the All India Catholic Union.

<HEADLINE> Delegates at Conference on Disarmament Condemn India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Delegates from more than 40
countries including Australia, China, the United States and
Pakistan have condemned India for its recent series of nuclear
tests.
</P>
<P>
"What the Indian government has done is undisguised contempt
for the international trend to ban nuclear tests completely," said
Chinese Ambassador Li Changhe here Thursday at a plenary session
of the Conference on Disarmament on the Indian nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
"It constitutes a severe blow to the international efforts to
prevent the proliferation of the nuclear weapons and a major
challenge to the international community as a whole," Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
"It will lead to serious consequences to the peace and
stability of the South Asian region and the whole world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li urged the international community to take a concerted stand
to strongly demand that India stop developing nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Australian Ambassador John B. Campbell said that the Indian
government had conducted two series of nuclear tests in three days
in the face of near universal condemnation.
</P>
<P>
"We can only conclude that this is the act of a government that
has the utmost disregard for accepted international norms of
behavior," he said.
</P>
<P>
"India's actions are a slap in the face to the overwhelming
majority of the international community determined to work towards
the goal of a nuclear weapon-free world," Campbell said. "India's
nuclear tests make a mockery of its claimed desire to remove
forever the threat of nuclear war."
</P>
<P>
The Australian ambassador expressed concern that India's
actions "can only exacerbate an already tense situation in its
immediate region, and have potentially serious implications for
global security."
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Ambassador Munir Akram said that the series of
nuclear weapon tests conducted by India on May 11 and 13 "have
significantly altered the strategic and security equation in our
region."
</P>
<P>
"The Indian tests are a direct and most serious challenge to
Pakistan's security," Akram said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani ambassador also accused a few Western countries
of helping India develop its nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"The United States strongly deplores the nuclear weapons tests
which India has just conducted," U.S. Ambassador Robert T. Grey
Jr. said. "As we are now hearing, the international community is
virtually unanimous in condemning them as well."
</P>
<P>
"India's tests are particularly deplorable in an era when the
international community has taken significant steps to reduce the
dangers posed by nuclear arms, including the successful
negotiation in this body of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and
the decision by the parties to extend indefinitely, and to
strengthen the Review Process for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty," Grey said.
</P>
<P>
Many delegates called on India to adhere itself to the
above-mentioned treaties and to participate in the Fissile
Material Cut-off Treaty negotiations.
</P>
<P>
At the same session, Indian Ambassador Ms Savitri Kunadi
alleged that India had not violated any international obligations
or undertakings when carrying out those nuclear tests. She said
that the tests were conducted "after a voluntary restraint
maintained for 24 years."

<HEADLINE> Eight Palestinians Killed by Israeli Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Eight Palestinians were
reportedly killed by Israeli army gunfire and over 200 injured
Thursday as bloody clashes marred the Palestinian "million-man
march" in remembrance of their uprooting after the creation of
Israel 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
A siren was wailing and one-minute silence observed by hundreds
of thousands of Palestinians who took to the streets in the
autonomous territories to mark "al nakba," Arabic for "the
catastrophe," referred to the loss of their homeland with the 1948
founding of Israel.
</P>
<P>
About 1 million Palestinians fled or were driven out of their
homes during the 1948 Mideast War, which broke out when Arab
armies fought Israelis after they declared independence.
</P>
<P>
The "million-man" march was organized by the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) with the aim to wake the awareness among
Palestinians of the past pains of Israeli occupation and to raise
the expectation for a better future.
</P>
<P>
The PNA tried to send a strong message to the Israeli
government and the international community to warn against
Israel's hardline policy that has stalled the peace process for
over one year.
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat delivered a 20-minute radio speech
to the Palestinian people, reaffirming the determination to create
an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Despite the PNA call for keeping calm, the Palestinian marches
quickly turned violent as protesters stoned Israeli soldiers
guarding the settlements and border crossings. Palestinian sources
said eight protesters were killed.
</P>
<P>
The first and most serious clashes erupted in Gaza Strip near
the Jewish settlement Gush Katif, when about 5,000 protesters
attacked Israeli soldiers with stones, who responded with live
ammunition, rubber bullets and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
At least five protesters, including an eight-year-old boy,
were killed and 35 others wounded, eight critically. Two Israeli
personnel carriers were brought to the site to contain the
rioting. At one point, protesters even stoned Palestinian
policemen who tried to separate them from Israeli soldiers,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Near the Eretz checkpoint in northern Gaza, Israeli soldiers
killed a 48-year-old medical staff and wounded 35 protesters.
</P>
<P>
At least 30 protesters were injured by rubber bullets and tear
gas fired by Israeli soldiers near the Maloufieh checkpoint at the
entrance to the West Bank city Ramallah. In Bethlehem, about 13
protesters were injured near the Jewish holy site of Rachel's Tomb
at the city's entrance.
</P>
<P>
In the flashpoint West Bank city of Hebron, where 450 Israeli
settlers remain in the city center, some 1,000 Palestinian
protesters clashed with Israeli soldiers. At least 73 protesters
including one five-year-old boy were wounded, one in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
In East Jerusalem, about 25 Palestinians and 15 Israeli
policemen were wounded in serious clashes in the Salah Edin
Street when the police tried to arrest some demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai held emergency
consultations with senior Army and security officers on the
worsening situation in the Palestinian areas. He said Israel
would do its best to prevent the escalation of violence and would
seek coordination with the PNA in restoring order.
</P>
<P>
The violent clashes occurred at a time when the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process is deeply stranded due to
Israeli settlement expansion and delays in redeployment in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces were already put on high alert at the
crossing points between Israel and Palestinian territories, and
barred Israelis from entering the territories for fear of their
safety.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have accused Israeli troops of firing
indiscriminately on unarmed demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials, however, charged that the PNA deliberately
organized the violence in an attempt to pressure Israel to make
concessions on the issue of redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in Washington and
cornered by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to accept
an American proposal in order to break the impasse in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Uzi Landau, chairman of Israeli Knesset (Parliament) Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee, claimed that Arafat's statements on
creating a Palestinian state violated the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Minister Moshe Katzav said that Israel bears no
responsibility for so-called "catastrophe" suffered by the
Palestinians, because it was the Arab side that provoked the war
in 1948 when Israel declared independence.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Military Newspaper Blasts India's Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The India's nuclear tests conducted
this week are detrimental to global and regional peace and
stability, said a signed article in the Liberation Army Daily on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The five nuclear tests, three on Monday and two more on
Wednesday, indicate that India's development of nuclear weapons
has emerged from secret to open stage, said the article entitled
Why India Is Making Haste to Cross Over the Nuclear Threshold.
</P>
<P>
Having reviewed the attitude of all Indian governments since
independence, the article pointed out that India's development of
nuclear weapons stemmed from its idea of striving to be a world
power.
</P>
<P>
All Indian governments have taken the seeking of a big power
status as their national strategic goal and regarded the
development of nuclear weapons as an important gateway to that
status, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The article quoted late National Congress leader Jawaharlal
Nehru as saying in his book The Discovery of India, written before
India's independence, that India should not play a second-class
role in the world.
</P>
<P>
India started to carry out its nuclear program in 1948 and to
work on nuclear weapons in the 1960s. After decades of efforts,
it made considerable progress in the development of nuclear
weapons when it detonated its first nuclear device in 1974, the
article said.
</P>
<P>
Western specialists estimated that the nuclear materials stored
in India are enough for making 20 to 50 pieces of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, India has also sped up its development and production
of missiles, the article added.
</P>
<P>
Since India's enforcement of its program of comprehensive
development of guided missiles in 1983, it has developed five
different types of missiles, of which the Agni medium-range
missile with a range of 2,500 kilometers can carry both
conventional and nuclear war-heads, the article said.
</P>
<P>
All Indian governments pursued a policy of keeping the nuclear
option open.
</P>
<P>
Under this policy, Indian governments take an ambiguous
attitude diplomatically on nuclear weapons development, while
secretly conducting research on the military use of nuclear
materials. Nuclear weapon parts are made and stored, ready to be
put together whenever necessary.
</P>
<P>
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which came to power in March,
said in its government policy that it will consider reviewing
India's nuclear policy and "exercise the option to induct nuclear
weapons."
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister George Fernandes also declared that "if
India's defense needs nuclear weapons, we shall not fight shy of
inducting them."
</P>
<P>
On the development of medium-range ballistic missiles,
Fernandes said if tests in this respect are carried out only for
tests' sake, there is not much necessity. However, they will be
conducted repeatedly if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the new Indian government put its
nuclear policy into practice in disregard of the international
tide of nuclear disarmament and the efforts to promote a global
nuclear test ban.
</P>
<P>
India's five underground nuclear tests this week have drawn
widespread criticism from the international community.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the joint efforts made by the international
community, the nuclear disarmament process has been moving on
gradually with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty adopted by the
United Nations in 1996 for the signature of all countries.
</P>
<P>
India's nuclear tests were conducted contrary to the current
international trend and they will by no means do any good to
regional and world peace and stability.

NICOSIA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Federal Council President
Ludwig Bieringer said here Thursday Vienna supported a proposal by
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides for the demilitarization in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after a meeting with Clerides, during which
they discussed the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Bieringer said he showed Clerides "Austria's support to the
positions and efforts of Cyprus government so that the island's
two communities will return to the negotiating table."
</P>
<P>
He added that "we support it and hope that logic will prevail
on the other side because there can be no peace without
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side walked out of peace negotiations last
summer after the European Union (EU) decided to start talks with
Cyprus on its accession.
</P>
<P>
Clerides first raised the demilitarization proposal in December
1993, calling for the disbandment of Greek Cypriot National Guard,
Turkish Cypriot armed forces and the withdrawal of Turkish forces
from northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
According to the idea, the weapons should be confiscated and
transferred into the U.N. peacekeeping forces' custody and the
money saved through demilitarization should be deposited into a
fund to benefit the two communities..
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since 1974 when Turkey landed
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots, who unilaterally declared a "Turkish Republic
of Northern Cyprus" in 1983, have insisted that negotiations can
only be resumed "between two states." The breakaway state is
recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the accession talks with the EU, Bieringer said
"Austria will fully back Cyprus' efforts to join the EU."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus submitted its application for EU membership in 1990,
and began negotiations with the EU in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Bieringer, who arrived here Tuesday for a three-day visit, also
met Wednesday with the 300 Austrian U.N. peacekeepers in Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Military Newspaper Blasts India's Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The India's nuclear tests conducted
this week are detrimental to global and regional peace and
stability, said a signed article in the Liberation Army Daily on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The five nuclear tests, three on Monday and two more on
Wednesday, indicate that India's development of nuclear weapons
has emerged from secret to open stage, said the article entitled
Why India Is Making Haste to Cross Over the Nuclear Threshold.
</P>
<P>
Having reviewed the attitude of all Indian governments since
independence, the article pointed out that India's development of
nuclear weapons stemmed from its idea of striving to be a world
power.
</P>
<P>
All Indian governments have taken the seeking of a big power
status as their national strategic goal and regarded the
development of nuclear weapons as an important gateway to that
status, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The article quoted late National Congress leader Jawaharlal
Nehru as saying in his book The Discovery of India, written before
India's independence, that India should not play a second-class
role in the world.
</P>
<P>
India started to carry out its nuclear program in 1948 and to
work on nuclear weapons in the 1960s. After decades of efforts,
it made considerable progress in the development of nuclear
weapons when it detonated its first nuclear device in 1974, the
article said.
</P>
<P>
Western specialists estimated that the nuclear materials stored
in India are enough for making 20 to 50 pieces of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, India has also sped up its development and production
of missiles, the article added.
</P>
<P>
Since India's enforcement of its program of comprehensive
development of guided missiles in 1983, it has developed five
different types of missiles, of which the Agni medium-range
missile with a range of 2,500 kilometers can carry both
conventional and nuclear war-heads, the article said.
</P>
<P>
All Indian governments pursued a policy of keeping the nuclear
option open.
</P>
<P>
Under this policy, Indian governments take an ambiguous
attitude diplomatically on nuclear weapons development, while
secretly conducting research on the military use of nuclear
materials. Nuclear weapon parts are made and stored, ready to be
put together whenever necessary.
</P>
<P>
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which came to power in March,
said in its government policy that it will consider reviewing
India's nuclear policy and "exercise the option to induct nuclear
weapons."
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister George Fernandes also declared that "if
India's defense needs nuclear weapons, we shall not fight shy of
inducting them."
</P>
<P>
On the development of medium-range ballistic missiles,
Fernandes said if tests in this respect are carried out only for
tests' sake, there is not much necessity. However, they will be
conducted repeatedly if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the new Indian government put its
nuclear policy into practice in disregard of the international
tide of nuclear disarmament and the efforts to promote a global
nuclear test ban.
</P>
<P>
India's five underground nuclear tests this week have drawn
widespread criticism from the international community.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the joint efforts made by the international
community, the nuclear disarmament process has been moving on
gradually with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty adopted by the
United Nations in 1996 for the signature of all countries.
</P>
<P>
India's nuclear tests were conducted contrary to the current
international trend and they will by no means do any good to
regional and world peace and stability.

<HEADLINE> French Gov't Makes Primary Step of Merging Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The French government Thursday made
its primary step of merging the two French plane-makers, the
Aerospatiale and the Dassault Aviation, by transferring 46 percent
of state-owned capital of Dassault to Aerospatiale.
</P>
<P>
The French Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Economy
announced in a joint communique that the decision is aimed at
encouraging a complete merger of the two plane companies, one
private and one state-owned.
</P>
<P>
It is also in the perspective of an overall restructuring of
the European aeronautics industry as was decided by France,
Germany and Britain last autumn, it said.
</P>
<P>
Aerospatiale, which co-produces Airbus passenger planes with
several other European companies, and the Dassault Aviation, which
produces the sophisticated war-planes of Mirage and Rafale, will
set up a "strategic committee" to coordinate policies in
marketing, research and development.
</P>
<P>
Both Aerospatiale and Dassault are world-scale plane producers,
with 56.7 billion francs (9.4 billion U.S. dollars) and 21.4
billion francs (3.56 billion dollars) of sale figures respectively
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Both of them immediately expressed satisfaction over the
government decision as the first step in reorganizing European
aeronautics industry.

<HEADLINE> Russian Envoy Reaffirms Need to Revive Lebanese, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian special Middle East envoy
Viktor Posuvalyuk Thursday reaffirmed the need to revive the
Lebanese and Syrian track in the peace process, calling for a
comprehensive settlement in the region.
</P>
<P>
He made this clear at a news conference after meeting with
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
He said that his talks with Hariri covered both bilateral ties
and the latest developments in the region, especially the Lebanese
and Syrian peace talks with Israel, which have been stalled for
more than two years.
</P>
<P>
"We both agree that there is the need not only to advance
Palestinian track, but also the Lebanese and Syrian track," he
said in fluent Arabic.
</P>
<P>
"I want to emphasize the need to achieve a comprehensive peace
in the region and reopen the negotiations between Israel, and
Lebanon and Syria, from where they were left off," he added.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese track were stopped
after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power in
June, 1996. The hardline politician refused to recognize what has
been agreed orally between Syria and his predecessor and asked to
reopen talks from scratch.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon, however, demanded that the negotiations be
resumed from where they were stopped, and asked Israel to return
the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East
war, and south Lebanon, where Israel set up a self-proclaimed
security zone in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Posuvalyuk, the Russian Middle East expert, arrived here on
Wednesday on a two-day visit. He has left for Damascus where he
will hold talks with Syrian leaders over the same issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States Thursday
postponed a planned visit by a military delegation to Indonesia as
the situation there is deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
"Given the deterioration today and the situation in Jakarta...
there was a literal question of getting into the country and then
the question of who do you meet with when you get there," the
State Department't top policy-maker for the region, Stanley Roth,
told a congressional hearing.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation was to have been headed by Adm. Joseph
Prueher, commander of the Hawaii-based U.S. forces in the Pacific.
He was to have carried a message urging "restraint" by Indonesian
security forces dealing with demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Roth told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that the
mission, which was to have begun Thursday, would be postponed
until it could be carried out. "But the message of restraint will
go forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the State Department was making arrangements for the
possible evacuation of some of 11,000 to 12,000 Americans in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"We can't guarantee the security of American citizens there and
neither can the Indonesian authorities," Roth said. But he said
there were no plans for a mass evacuation and no plans to close
the U.S. embassy in Jakarta.

ANKARA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said Thursday that it hopes
that the proposed meeting Friday between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova would
help put an end to the current bloody conflicts in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey hopes that this dialog process will reach a positive
result in a short time. Turkey believes this meeting will
contribute to peace and stability in the region," a Turkish
Foreign Ministry statement said.
</P>

It said that Turkey has maintained from the very beginning
that the tragic bloodshed in the Yugoslav province should be
stopped and a peaceful solution should be found.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Presidential Envoy Richard Holbrooke announced Wednesday
that Milosevic and Rugova have agreed to hold talks in Belgrade
Friday without putting any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
The Milosevic-Rugova meeting will be followed by weekly
meetings between the Serbian and Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
delegations.
</P>
<P>
Since February, massive bloody clashes erupted between Serbian
police and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Yugoslavia, killing at
least 90 people.

<HEADLINE> Susan McDougal Pleads Innocent in Obstruction of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Whitewater figure Susan McDougal
pleaded innocent Thursday to accusations that she obstructed
justice by refusing to talk to a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal said only "Not guilty" before U.S. Magistrate H.
David Young in Little Rock, Arkansas. Trial on charges of criminal
contempt and obstruction of justice was set for June 22. Lawyers
said they expect the trial to last three weeks, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal, 43, was charged for refusing to answer
Whitewater grand jury questions about the president.
</P>
<P>
In May 1996, she was convicted on four fraud counts and
sentenced to two years in prison. Then Arkansas Governor Jim Guy
Tucker and Mrs. McDougal's ex-husband, James McDougal, also were
convicted in the Whitewater trial, spearheaded by Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal refused to answer questions about President Bill
Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton before the Whitewater grand
jury, and U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright found her in
civil contempt.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal completed an 18-month stint in prison for the
civil contempt citation. Then in March, she began serving the
two-year sentence on the criminal conviction.
</P>
<P>
The grand jury, after two years of investigation, disbanded
earlier this month. Its only indictment included the latest
criminal charges against Mrs. McDougal, again for refusing to
answer questions in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Her lawyer, Mark Geragos of Los Angeles, maintains Starr is
trying to bully his client.

<HEADLINE> Iran Summons Argentine Diplomat Over Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry Thursday
summoned Argentine charge d'affaires to Iran to protest the
Argentine accusations that Iran was behind the 1994 bomb blasts in
Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry Director General for American affairs
Mohammad Reza Bakhtiari warned that Tehran would reconsider its
relations with Argentina if it continues to level charges against
Iran, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
A number of Argentine officials, Interior Minister Carlos
Corach in particular, have recently rehashed the charges that
Iranian diplomats were involved in the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Bakhtiari expressed fury at Argentina's insistence on
attributing the incidents to Iran, saying that Tehran has showed
Argentine government evidence that the witness in the incidents
was a fraud.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, a bomb exploded near the Israeli Embassy in Buenos
Aires, and another blasted at a Jewish center, killing 88 people
and inuring 159 others.
</P>
<P>
After the blasts, an Iranian national, identified as Manouchehr
Motamer, offered some information to the Argentine authorities,
incriminating four Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic relations between the two countries were lowered to
charge d'affaires level after the bomb blasts.
</P>
<P>
Bakhtiari pointed out that Argentina has so far not held even a
single court session to investigate a terrorist attack three years
ago on a former Iranian charge d'affaires in Buenos Aires.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- France's two mainstream centrist and
rightwing parties, the Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) and
Union for French Democracy (UDF), Thursday reorganized themselves
by setting up a loose combination which will represent them as a
single political force for the first time in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The combination, simply termed "Alliance," does not mean a
merger between the two parties, stressed UDF president Francois
Leotard, who signed the agreement on combination with RPR
president Philippe Seguin.
</P>
<P>
Seguin said the alliance will respect the "double objective of
union and pluralism" in rightwing forces.
</P>
<P>
The RPR and the UDF have been plunged into a deep crisis since
the dissolution of the National Assembly last year by President
Jacques Chirac. The crisis was worsened by the regional elections
in March.
</P>
<P>
The RPR and the UDF will elaborate a common program and elect a
single president, according to the agreement on alliance.
</P>
<P>
They also vowed not to compromise with the far-right National
Front (FN) and reaffirmed their strategy vis-a-vis the FN.
</P>
<P>
President Chirac immediately congratulated the establishment of
the alliance, saying that it will allow the rightwing opposition
to play an effective role in the political life of France.

ADDIS ABABA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA) said on Thursday that ECA will host a
conference at which the benefits of cable and satellite for the
development of African countries will be examined.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here by the ECA said that the
conference entitled ''Global Connectivity for Africa'', scheduled
to open in Addis Ababa from June 2-4, is part of the program of
the African Information Society Initiative (AISI) which ECA
implements with its partners, as well as a follow-up of Africa
Telecom '98 which took place in Johannesburg, May 4-9, 1998.

The press release said that over 300 leading figures in the
area of telecommunication, including high level ministers,
representatives from the civil society as well as private African
and non-African companies, are expected to participate in the
conference to thrash out the options and issues pertinent to
achieve global connectivity for the continent.
</P>
<P>
It emphasized that the global connectivity for Africa has been
recognized as one of the prerequisites for a sustainable
development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The conference hopes to provide "a unique opportunity for
African decision-makers, promoters of these technologies as well
as users to engage in frank dialogue on the issues and options of
connectivity open to the continent and the value of information
for Africa in terms of trade and commerce," the ECA press release
said.

JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel announced Thursday that
its Chief of General Staff Amnon Shahak has canceled a trip to New
Delhi, as the world became outrageous over India's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the army on Thursday said the decision to
call off the visit, which had been scheduled for early June, was
made early this week.
</P>
<P>
But the statement did not give the reason for the cancellation.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post daily, however, Wednesday quoted an Israeli
security specialist as saying that India's recent nuclear tests
are "very bad for Israel."
</P>
<P>
India set off five nuclear devices on Monday and Wednesday. The
tests have sparked international condemnation. The United States
has decided to impose economic sanctions on India.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. sanctions on India "might, in the future, be
considered as a precedent for similar action against Israel,"
Gabriel Ben-Dor, director of Haifa University's National Security
Studies Program, said.
</P>
<P>
Israel is widely believed to have acquired nuclear capability.
Like India, it has not signed up the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty.

Nor has it made any official reaction to India's nuclear tests
so far.

NEW YORK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Computer Associates International,
Inc., the New York-based enterprise software maker, announced the
public availability of the simplified Chinese version of Jasmine,
a huge database management software.
</P>
<P>
Developed jointly by CA and Fujitsu of Japan, Jasmine is the
first object solution for building a king of next-generation
business systems over the Internet and client/server computing
environments.
</P>
<P>
Jasmine is said to be the only solution of its kind that
employs double-byte coding -- a technology which dedicates two
bytes of memory to certain characters -- enabling it to
accommodate the large number of characters in the Chinese
language.
</P>
<P>
"Bringing the industry-leading object capabilities of Jasmine
to the Chinese market illustrates CA's strong commitment to our
Chinese clients," said CA Chairman and CEO Charles B. Wang, who is
now on a China visit in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The English version of Jasmine was shipped about a year ago.
Jasmine comes with comprehensive capabilities of creating and
managing complex data types, including graphics, animation,
audio, time-series, global positioning coordinates and
full-motion video. It also supports electronic commerce and
various kinds of customer services.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Women's Role Stressed in Livestock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- An Ethiopian senior official
said Thursday that development of animal production will only be
enhanced if the role of women is recognized.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the sixth national conference of the Ethiopian
Society of Animal Production here, Tadelech Hailemichael, Women
Affairs Head in the Office of the Prime Minister, said women are
a dominant and important force in animal production, the
Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
She said almost all the strenuous operations of feeding and
caring of livestock collection and processing of dairy products
are performed by women.
</P>
<P>
However, she said, the contribution of women to the national
development have not been fully recognized and adequately
enumerated.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore high time that we recognize the dynamic role
women can play in changing the community," she said.
</P>
<P>
She expressed hope that the conference will adequately address
the dynamic role of improving animal productivity and
identification of ways and means that enhance the productivity
and contributions of women in animal production.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference, opened Thursday, was organized under
the theme "Women and Animal production in Ethiopia".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the conference, President of the Society of Animal
Production, Zinash Sileshi, said one of the shortcomings of
agriculture development in general and livestock development in
particular in Ethiopia is lack of recognition of the roles of
family members, especially women in the development process.
</P>
<P>
"It is the women that do the major portion of animal
production activities of rural farms," she said, adding that "It
is therefore important to actively involve women in the process
of improving animal production."
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Society of Animal Production was established in
1987.

issue in the court battle that is delaying Starr's probe.
</P>
<P>
At an open hearing before the federal judge overseeing the
Lewinsky case, Starr said "absolutely nothing supports" the
agency's claim that a new protective function privilege shields
its employees from answering certain questions in the probe of an
alleged presidential affair and cover-up.
</P>
<P>
"The testimony of certain Secret Service personnel is highly
relevant" in determining whether "one or more persons may have
engaged in illegal acts including perjury, obstruction of justice
and intimidation of witnesses," Starr said.
</P>
<P>
"The issue is the assassination of presidents of the United
States," countered Justice Department lawyer Gary Grindler, saying
that requiring the agents to testify would hinder their ability to
protect the president, who would "push the agents away."
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson said of the asserted
harm, "I don't see it."
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate indication when the judge would rule in
the case.
</P>
<P>
Grindler said that forcing testimony from the agents would
cause "injury" to the "relationship... they must have with the
president."

<P>
ATHENS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday welcomed the
forthcoming meeting between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
and Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova which will take
place in Belgrade Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Thursday, the Greek Foreign Ministry
said that Athens expressed its satisfaction at this development
and reiterated its willingness to continue providing its
assistance to all sides if needed.
</P>
<P>
Greece hoped that both sides would fully assume their political
responsibility for resolving the Kosovo problem, to the benefit of
Yugoslavia and also the broader region, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Greek foreign ministry also stressed that the
essential condition for the normalization of the Kosovo situation
was to respect the existing borders of Yugoslavia, the political
and human rights of all inhabitants in the area.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 people have been killed in recent months in
Kosovo where ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the
province's nearly 2 million population and have been demanding
their independence from Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad
met Thursday with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister and special
envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk to discuss the latest situation in the
Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Posuvalyuk arrived here Thursday morning after visiting
Lebanon. No detail of his talks with the Syrian president is
available.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, he held talks with Lebanese leaders on the latest
developments in the Mideast peace process, especially the Israeli
offer of conditional withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Both Lebanon and Syria have rejected the Israeli offer,
insisting that the United Nations Security Council resolution 425
calls for an immediate and unconditional Israeli pullout from
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During his meetings with leaders of the two countries, the
Russian envoy voiced hope that peace talks on all tracks could be
reactivated.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian and Lebanese peace track has been stalled since
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Syria is seeking a comprehensive peaceful settlement with
Israel to secure the return of the Golan Heights, which were
captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Export-Import Bank Approves Grant for Uzbekistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Export-Import Bank has
approved a 215 million U.S. dollars long-term guarantee to finance
the export by ABB Lummus Global Inc. of engineering services and
equipment for a polyethylene plant in Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
A press release received Thursday said that three U.S.
suppliers from Connecticut, New Jersey and Texas will also provide
essential services to the project.
</P>
<P>
"The transaction is certainly a vote of confidence in the
Uzbekistan economy and demonstrates Ex-Im Bank's willingness to
help U.S. exporters compete in this developing market," said the
bank's chairman James Harmon.
</P>
<P>
The bank's involvement is a "cornerstone" to the successful
financing of this project and the Uzbekistani government considers
it a major catalyst to spearhead the country's macroeconomic
development, said an ABB official.
</P>
<P>
Ex-Import Bank's guarantee of a loan by Chase Manhattan Bank,
will finance U.S. exports to design, build and commission the
plant, know as the Shurtan Gas Chemical Complex.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is estimated at 762 million U.S.
dollars. Official export credit agencies from Uzbekistan, Japan
and Germany will provide the rest financing needed for the
project.
</P>
<P>
Ex-Im Bank is an independent federal agency that supports
American jobs by financing the sales of U.S. goods and services to
foreign markets. In 1997, the bank supported U.S. exports valued
at more than 15 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Draft Ozone Layer Protection Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has promised to map out its
policy for the protection of the ozone layer as quickly as
possible, the official News Agency of Nigeria reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Work on the Nigerian document on the fundamental
legal policy framework for the purpose will soon be finalized,
the report said, quoting Federal Environmental Protection Agency
(FEPA) Director-General R.O. Adewoye.
</P>
<P>
According to the FEPA chief, Nigeria has earlier formulated
such a policy but there are problems relating to preparation of a
country program.
</P>
<P>
"The document will be submitted in time for considerations at
the forthcoming executive committee meeting to be held in July
1998," he told a workshop on ozone depleting substances (ODS) for
officials from English-speaking African nations Tuesday in the
capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
On Nigeia's effort to ensure environmental friendliness of its
industries, Adewoye said, 13 investment projects in
refrigeration, air-conditioning and foam making, totalling 5.4
million U.S. Dollars, have been approved.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has also set a national advisory
committee and a national ozone office in collaboration with the
World Bank, the United Nations Development Program and the U.N.
Industrial Development Organization.
</P>
<P>
The two new establishments will be in charge of finalizing
Nigeria's country program and formulating investment projects in
refrigeration, foam, solvent and aerosol sub-sectors.
</P>
<P>
The one-day workshop, which were attended by 18
English-speaking countries from the continent, was aimed to
enable the ODS officers to learn from regional experiences,
increase capacity to fulfil their respective country's obligation
under the Montreal Protocol and address areas relating to the
protocol's implementation.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Insists on "Territorial Buffer" for Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Before his second day of meeting
with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that there should be
a "territorial buffer" to be preserved if Washington asks him to
accepts its proposals on troops' withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"The only peace that can endure is a peace that can be
defended," Netanyahu told a news conference at the Washington
Institute for Near East Policy before going to Capitol Hill to
meet with members of Congress for the purpose of rallying support
from lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
He said the interim Oslo agreements, signed by former Labor
government leaders and Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat for the
redeployment of Israel's troops on the West Bank, had "failed
miserably."
</P>
<P>
"That's the reason I am standing here as prime minister of
Israel," he said, referring to his winning of elections two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu also tried to minimize his differences with the
Clinton administration on the scale of pullback on the West Bank,
describing them as "disagreements around the dinner table in a
family."
</P>
<P>
He said he was willing to take some risks and pull its troops
back, but a "territorial buffer" is needed to protect Israel's
security.
</P>
<P>
"We're prepared to redeploy from additional land," he said.
"But we cannot do so while compromising our security, because we
know that if we compromise our security, the peace will collapse."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was warmly welcomed on Capitol Hill, where
congressional leaders said Israel needs firm security guarantees
before it makes more concessions on the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Blair Urges Decommissioning in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair on
Thursday told voters in the forthcoming Northern Ireland
referendum that there will be no "fudge between democracy and
terror."
</P>
<P>
Speaking after arriving in Belfast, Blair said he would not
allow groups to pursue a "twin-track of the ballot box and the
gun," and he urged the paramilitary groups to decommission their
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Blair said that if their allies were to benefit from the
accord, perhaps taking part in a new executive to run Northern
Ireland, guerrilla groups must give "a clear and unequivocal
commitment that there is an end to violence for good".
</P>
<P>
The peace deal, reached a month ago by the eight political
parties in Northern Ireland, requires the completion of
decommissioning within two years of the referendum next week.
</P>
<P>
This is Blair's second visit to the divided province in eight
days, reflecting his concern over a possible "No" vote in the
referendum on May 22.
</P>
<P>
"To say yes is to say yes to a future of hope," the prime
minister told the gathering at the Royal Ulster Agricultural Show.
</P>
<P>
"It is surely reasonable that there should be
confidence-building measures from these organization after all the
suffering they have inflicted on the people of Northern Ireland,"
the British prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
He also said he had decided they must be given legislative
expression directly and plainly in the legislation to come before
Parliament in the coming weeks and months.
</P>
<P>
"Those who have used the twin tactics of ballot box and the gun
must make a clear choice. There can be no fudge between democracy
and terror," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Leaves for G-8 Summit After German Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FRANKFURT, May 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton wound
up a two-day visit to Germany Thursday evening and left for
Britain to attend the Group of Eight (G-8) summit to be opened
Friday in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's visit to Germany was made on the occasion of the 50th
anniversary of the Berlin Airlift, a U.S.-led operation in 1948-49
to bring foods and other supplies to the then West Berlin during a
blockade by former Soviet troops.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony marking the event, both Clinton and
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl hailed the strong partnership
between the two countries and pledged to continue to work together
to confront challenges in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In his various speeches over the past two days, Clinton
underscored his support for European Union's march towards
economic integration and eastward enlargement to include central
and eastern European countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile he also called on the EU to open up to Turkey and
declared that Europe must support Russia's reform.
</P>
<P>
While Clinton's visit to Germany was meant to highlight
transatlantic partnership, it was largely overshadowed by two
rounds of nuclear tests conducted by India earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
In protest, Clinton formally ordered broad economic sanctions
against India on Wednesday in Potsdam and called on other nations
to do the same.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president used almost every occasion during his stay
in Germany to praise the vision and leadership of the country's
veteran chancellor Kohl, who is in the midst of a fierce campaign
to win re-election in September this year.
</P>
<P>
"America honors your vision and achievement and is proud to
march with you shoulder to shoulder into the new millennium,"
Clinton said in a speech Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Clinton also met with Kohl's rival in the
elections, Gerhard Schroeder of the leftist Social Democratic
Party, who currently enjoys a strong lead in most opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday afternoon, Clinton made a gesture to the poorer
eastern half of Germany by visiting the small city of Eisenach,
which hosts the U.S. major investment in the region, the carmaker
Adam Opel AG.
</P>
<P>
Addressing growing public disenchantment in eastern Germany
where unemployment of over 20 percent is a common phenomenon,
Clinton called on citizens there to keep their dream alive and not
to underestimate what had been achieved after the German
reunification in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Yemen Calls for More Pressure on Israel in Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Yemen Thursday urged the
international community to bring more pressure on Israel for its
withdrawal from Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
The call was contained in a statement issued by the Yemeni
government on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of "al nakba,"
Arabic for "the catastrophe," a reference to the loss of
Palestinians' homeland with the founding of Israel in 1948.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet called on the United Nations to put more pressure
on Israel to withdraw from the Syrian Golan Heights, South Lebanon
and the Palestinian territories under the relevant U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the intransigence of the Israeli leaders on the
peace process to the U.S. support which is biased in favor of
Israel economically, politically and militarily.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace process on the Israeli-Palestinian,
Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese tracks have gradually entered
into stalemate since the hardline Likud government took power in
mid 1996.

LAGOS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and Guinea have reaffirmed
their commitment to dialogue and consultation to resolve conflict
and maintain peace and security in the west African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also appealed for the reinforcement of the
mechanism for the prevention of conflicts and the maintenance of
peace in the sub-region, according to a report reaching the
Nigeria capital Abuja Thursday.
</P>
<P>
These are the main points of communique after a one-day visit
by Guinean President Lansana Cote to Nigeria, but it did not
specify when the visit took place.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, Cote and his Nigerian counterpart
General Sani Abacha renewed their commitment to rapid economic
integration in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
They also appealed to member states of the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS) to demonstrate the implementation

<HEADLINE> AL Calls for Support to Palestinian Struggle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) Thursday
appealed to all Arab countries for support to the Palestinian
leadership in its struggle for restoring the "usurped rights of
the Palestinian people," the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Fifty years after the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians
lost their homes to the Israelis, the AL issued a statement
underlining the need to restore the Palestinian rights to an
independent state and to get the peace process off the logjam it
had reached.
</P>
<P>
It called on the United States and Russia, the two sponsors of
the Mideast peace process, to take up their responsibility in
salvaging the peace process by all possible means.
</P>
<P>
The same call is also directed by the league to Japan, the
European Union and the Non-Alignment Movement member countries, as
well as the United Nations and other international agencies and
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries had announced in 1996 at their Cairo summit
that they had opted for peace as a strategic choice. They now
warned against the explosion of Palestinian people's indignation.
</P>
<P>
"A just and durable peace in the Middle East requires a
commitment to restoring the usurped lands and rights and
guaranteeing a balanced and equitable security to all the region's
countries," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have stalled since March 1997
over the Israeli construction of a new settlement in East
Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as their future capital.

<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe fell
on Thursday, depressed by concerns on possible U.S. interest rates
rise, profit-taking, violence in Indonesia and fallout of India's
nuclear tests, but ended above the day's lows following Wall
Street's recovery.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE-100 index had dropped more than one percent
earlier in the session before ending 24.4 points or 0.41 percent
lower at 5,948.5, dragged down by fears over the future direction
of global interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the market charted the stormy course of
trading on Wall Street and reacted to a sharp overnight fall in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, concerns about the political unrest in Indonesia and
fading hopes of a UK interest rate cut also weighed on sentiment.
</P>
<P>
There was also anxiety about the outlook for US rates ahead of
next week's policy setting meeting.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares spent most of the session weak and
worried by fresh violence in Indonesia, with the DAX-30 index
closing down 15.66 points or 0.29 percent at 5,361.22.
</P>

Traders said that investors were cautious ahead of Friday's

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Urged to Be Restrained on India's Nuke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Thursday urged
Pakistan to exercise "maximum restraint" after this week's
nuclear tests by India, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Pakistani High Commissioner Shafkat Saheed
conveyed his government's concerns over the nuclear tests to
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo in a meeting in
Pretoria earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Nzo reiterated South Africa's own concerns about the
matter, but urged the Pakistani government to exercise maximum
restraint during this difficult period," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Nzo emphasized that South Africa is opposed to all nuclear
tests, believing international security will be ensured by
nuclear disarmament instead of the proliferation of nuclear
weapons, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The minister also expressed the hope that the Indian nuclear
tests would not result in increased tension and an arms race in
South Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Pakistan, India's long-time rival, is
expected to set off a nuclear explosion within the next few days
in retaliation for India's testing.
</P>
<P>
India, which carried out underground nuclear tests this week,
was widely condemned by the international community. The United
States and Japan have announced economic sanctions against New
Delhi.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, however, has refused to take individual action
against India, with which South Africa maintains close economic
and political relations.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela said Wednesday that he
would prefer a common approach under the auspices of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
"We prefer that all these things should be done by the United
nations and that no country should take an individual position on
matters that affect the international community," said Mandela.

ANKARA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and
Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin Thursday reiterated Ankar's strong
opposition to Cyprus' missile plan, according to the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Turkish Cypriots would take "all necessary measures"
to prevent the deployment of the Russian-made S-300 missiles on
the divided island, Sezgin told reporters in the Aegean city of
Izmir.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Turkey's territorial security and Turkish
Cypriots' freedom and rights would face a big threat if the
missiles were deployed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Greece, a firm supporter of the Cyprus government
controlled by Greek Cypriots, Sezgin said that a member state of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should not adopt a
hostile attitude toward Turkey, which is also a NATO member.
</P>
<P>
"We hold that all the sides concerned should come together
and discuss the problem in a peaceful manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
A Cyprus-Russian deal last year on the purchase of Russian-made
missiles has triggered harsh reaction from Ankara and Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Turkish military has warned that it will take pre-emptive
measures it the missiles are shipped to the island.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish government urged Moscow to cancel the
contract, stressing that such a deal would undermine the friendly
relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that it had no
intention to give up the deal and the missiles would be delivered
to the Cypriot government in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Chief of General Staff Ismail Hakki Karadayi is to
visit Moscow next week. The missile issue is believed to be a
focus in his talks with Russian officials, local press reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops landed and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of an abortive pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
At present, both Turkey and Greece have stationed heavily armed
troops on the small island.

<HEADLINE> IBM Looks into Future Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The share price of the
International Business Machine Corp. (IBM) surged Thursday after the
company chairman stressed its growth in services and storage
capacity provision.
</P>
<P>
IBM chairman and CEO Lou Gerstner told the Wall Street analysts
Wednesday that the company's booming services business can elevate
IBM's overall revenue growth rate from its current single-digit
rate to double-digits within the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The IBM stock price increased by 3.74 percent today to nearly
127 U.S. dollars from 122 dollars.
</P>
<P>
He also projected strong growth in the future from IBM's hard
disk storage business, and saw new growth for System/390 server and
software sales.
</P>
<P>
The head of the company said they have witnessed a rapid growth
in the overseas market. Last year, 14 of 24 contracts, with more
than 100 million U.S. dollars each at least, were struck with
clients outside the U.S. "So far this year, five out of seven were
outside the country," he said. IBM has 44 billion U.S. dollars in
services contracts, which generate 25 percent of its revenue and
employ one-third of its staff.
</P>
<P>
IBM's investment of 2.3 billion U.S. dollars in research on
hard-disk drives since 1996, Gerstner said, has paid off, with 1
billion U.S. dollar in hard-disk drive sales last year to the top
five PC manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The company is not doing well on PC servers, according to
Gerstner. Compaq has grabbed much of the market.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Urges Prevention of Opposition Gathering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei Thursday called on the people of the central province of
Isfahan to prevent a scheduled gathering on Friday of supporters
of a dissident religious canonist.
</P>
<P>
A report of the official news agency IRNA said that Khamenei
sent a message to the people of the province, calling on them "to
neutralize the attempts by deceived people."
</P>
<P>
The report said that some people in the province planned a
rally Friday to show their support for the disgraced Ayatollah
Hussein Ali Montazeri, a former designated successor to the late
Iranian spiritual leader Imam Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Montazeri has been under house arrest in the religious city of
Qom since last November after he challenged the supreme leadership
of Khamenei and blamed him for interfering in government affairs.
</P>
<P>
In his message, Khamenei said he was confident that the Isfahan
citizens would not allow the people, "who bothered the late Imam
Khomeini when he was alive," to go on with "their conspiracy."

<HEADLINE> Arafat Blasts Israel for "Barbaric Act" as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat Friday condemned Israel for its
"barbaric act" in the bloody clashes Thursday as violence
continued in Palestinian self-rule areas and East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking outside his office in the Gaza Strip, Arafat warned
that the clashes, in which eight Palestinian people were
reportedly killed and over 200 wounded in Israeli army gunfire,
might trigger an explosion of violence in the area. He urged the
international community to act quickly to protect the deeply
deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's clashes, the worst since September 1996, broke out
as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians took to streets in
Palestinian self-rule areas to mark the 50th anniversary of Nakba,
or "catastrophe" in Arabic, which refers to the creation of Israel.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the clashes between stone-throwing Palestinians and
Israeli soldiers continued. An Israeli photographer was injured in
the West Bank city of Hebron by rubber bullets fired by Israeli
soldiers. Palestinian sources said that several Palestinians were
also injured.
</P>
<P>
In southern Gaza, Israeli soldiers fired rubber bullets to
disperse dozens of Palestinian protesters. Clashes also broke out
in the Old City of East Jerusalem, but no injuries were
reported. About 1,600 Israeli policemen were deployed in the area
to maintain the security during Friday's prays in the mosque.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israel Radio reported Friday that the United
States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright telephoned Arafat
Thursday night and asked him to exercise "maximum restraint"
following the clashes. She said that "similar requests" were made
to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister, who had successfully rejected
the U.S. proposal on Israel's further redeployment in two rounds
of talks with Albright, blamed the PNA for Thursday's clashes,
saying that the Palestinian side tried to pressure Israel to
make concession on the issue of redeployment.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee declared Friday that India is now a nuclear weapons state
and ruled out the signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
which he described as "discriminatory."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with India Today magazine, Vajpayee said, "We
have a big bomb now for which necessary command and control system
is also in place."
</P>
<P>
He told the weekly's executive editor Prabhu Chawla that "there
is no question of accepting any treaty that is discriminatory in
nature. No one should have any illusions on this score."
</P>
<P>
The Indian prime minister said India's intentions "were, are
and will always be peaceful," according to excerpts of the
interview released by the weekly.
</P>
<P>
He declared that "sanctions cannot and will not hurt us" and
"India will not be cowed down by any such threats and punitive
steps." However, he added, "every decisive action has its
consequences" and the nuclear tests have "entailed a price."
</P>
<P>
The Indian government would present its case before the
international community, both bilaterally and in multilateral
bodies, Vajpayee told the weekly which would carry the interview
in a special issue Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On justification for conducting the nuclear tests at this
juncture, he said it was in keeping with the commitment made to
the people during the elections and part of the National Agenda
for Governance.

women's 400-meter individual medley on the first day of the
Chinese National Swimming Championships here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old swimmer from Liaoning province, enjoyed an
apparent edge from the start in the medley finals, storming home
in four minutes 47.39 seconds, ahead of Ning Xin in 4:51.73.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not satisfied with my timing although it is my first
national title," said Ning Bo who ranked third in last year's
world rankings next to world record holder Chen Yan and Wu Yanyan
in the women's 400-meter medley.
</P>
<P>
"My personal best was 4:39.60, but there were no strong rivals
to push me fast tonight," she said, "Actually, I didn't attain
much attention to the meet because my major target this year is
directed upon the Asian Games."
</P>
<P>
Ning Bo was obviously not in the mood to celebrate her victory.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 400-meter freestyle finals, Deng Qingsong of Hebei
province, exploited his home advantage to take the coveted gold
medal in 3:59.84. Shi Cheng finished second in 4:00.85.
</P>
<P>
Cui Ziyi easily entered the women's 200-meter butterfly finals
after her winning time in 2:13.33 in the semi-finals, two seconds
ahead her nearest rival Hu Ning 2:15.33 and Liu Xiaxiao in 2:15.46.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Yi, winner of the 200-meter breaststroke title in the
National Games last October, topped the qualifiers in the men's
100-meter breaststroke in 1:03.99, while Zeng Qiliang, No. 3 in
the last year's 100-meter world rankings in 1:01.66, finished
first in the semifinals in 1:04.17.

BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Procurators were urged not to abuse

Addressing a rectification work conference attended by
high-ranking procurators, Han Shubin, Procurator-general of
China's Supreme People's Procuratorate, made positive comments
towards the main stream of the country's procurators but also
pointed out that some unhealthy tendency exists among the
country's procuratorate team.
</P>
<P>
"Great achievements have been made during the past years, but
we still need to pay closer attention to the quality improvement
of procurators in order to serve the nation's reform and
opening-up better," he said.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative region (SAR) government is trying its best to
assist Hong Kong people stranded in Indonesia, said a high-ranking
official here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Peter Lai, Secretary for Security, said Friday that Cathay
Pacific Airways, Hong Kong's flagship airline, has provided more
seats on its daily scheduled flights from Jakarta to Hong Kong. By
using larger aircraft, Cathay is able to carry 200 more Hong Kong
passengers back home every day.
</P>
<P>
The SAR official said: "The government has been in touch with
the charterer and would order a special flight if necessary."
</P>
<P>
He urged those Hong Kong people stranded in Indonesia to
contact the Chinese Embassy there in the first instance for
registration and to report their situation.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government has been in close contact with the
Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs
in monitoring the latest development regarding the disturbance in
Indonesia, said Lai.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Commissioner's Office said here Friday
that the Chinese Embassy in Jakarta had arranged vehicles to
physically contact some 70 Hong Kong compatriots stranded in
Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> HK's Overall Employment Prospects Positive: Anson Chan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Anson Chan, chief secretary for
Administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,
said here Friday that Hong Kong's overall employment prospects are
positive.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at a ceremony to mark the completion of government
facilities at the New International Airport, Chan said over the
next five years, a total of 235 billion HK dollars (30 billion
U.S. dollars) will be invested in new infrastructural projects,
half as much again as the 155 billion HK dollar (19.87 billion
U.S. dollars) Airport Core Program.
</P>
<P>
"This underlines our unshakable commitment to continuing to
build for Hong Kong's future," she said, adding: "plenty of job
opportunities will flow from this massive new investment."
</P>
<P>
She noted that the West Rail and Mass Transit Railway Tseung
Kwan O Extension will be embarked on shortly, which will double
the length of Hong Kong's rail system and generate some 13,000
jobs over the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many more jobs will flow from the Public
Works Program, and the growth areas in the services sector
including the telecommunications and information technology
industries.
</P>
<P>
As the new Hong Kong International Airport comes on stream in
July, some 6,000 new jobs in the services sector will also be
created, she said.
</P>
<P>
Chan said: "We are stepping up our efforts on all fronts to
help the unemployed re-enter the labor market as soon as
possible."
</P>
<P>
Over 7,000 people have found jobs so far this year through the
Labor Department's placement service and the placement rate is
increasing. There are still some 12,000 vacancies registered with
the department, she said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Employees Retraining Board will boost its
expenditure by one-third to 301 million HK dollars (38.58 million
U.S. dollars) in this financial year to provide 73,000 training
places.
</P>
<P>
The Vocational Training Council will launch a Business Starter
Program next month to provide potential owner-managers with the
knowledge and skills to evaluate their business plans, conduct
feasibility studies and set up new business in Hong Kong, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Chan noted that Hong Kong is going through a painful economic
adjustment process and the current economic downturn affects the
employment. However, she expressed the belief that like all
storms, it will blow itself out and the sunshine will follow.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Both defending champion Indonesia

<P>
Indonesia won over England five matches to none in Group B's

It was a fairly easy day for the world's top two sides, or, as
Indonesia's top woman players Susi Susanti put it, it came just
like a warm-up.
</P>
<P>
It was a matter of only 15 minutes as Susanti, former Olympic
and world champion, won over Julia Mann from England 11-0, 11-1 in
the opening singles match.

<HEADLINE> HK Will Emerge Stronger After Crisis: Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A leading Hong Kong banker Friday
voiced optimism over Hong Kong's economic and financial strength,
saying the city "will emerge stronger" from the regional financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Opportunities (rising from the crisis) are waiting to be
uncovered and developed," he said, pointing out that Hong Kong can
make itself "an even more important business and financial
center."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a trade fair here promoting financial products and
services, Mervyn Davies, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of
Banks, listed some bad news in the past several months, such as
the slipping property and share prices, shrinking retail sales and
rising unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"Cyclical ups and downs occur in any economy. This downturn we
are having in Hong Kong is of course a serious one," he said
</P>
<P>
"But we need to remind ourselves that Hong Kong is much better
off when compared with most other parts of Southeast Asia," the
banker told MoneyWorld Asia - Hong Kong '98, which opened at the
Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's three most important markets -- China's mainland,
the United States and Europe -- are still experiencing robust
growth while Hong Kong's external trade figures appear reasonably
good, the banker stressed.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of Hong Kong's flexibility and dynamism, the
pro-business environment which encourages entrepreneurship and
rewards hard work, and a strong, capital-intensive and orderly
institutional framework, all of which are "grounds for optimism."
</P>
<P>
And the banking system "forms an integral part of this
institutional setup" and "has proved itself as one of the most
trustworthy pillars of the local economy," Davies noted, claiming
that the banks have provided the necessary support for Hong Kong
businesses to go out and capture market opportunities around the
world.
</P>
<P>
"The strength of the banking system in Hong Kong is also a key
factor underlying the territory's resilience in the face of the
strains of the Asian turmoil," Davies stressed.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that his association will continue to work closely
with the authorities to ensure that the banking system remains
sound and stays ahead of developments in international financial
markets.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Send Bigger Aircraft to Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary
Domingo Siazon said here Friday that he has asked the Philippine
Airlines to send bigger aircraft to Jakarta to accommodate
Filipinos desiring to return to Manila.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said the escalating riots and violence in the Indonesian
capital have compelled Filipinos there to book flights home but
could not be accommodated by the Airbus-300 aircraft being used
for regular Manila-Jakarta flights.
</P>
<P>
As of Friday, he said, some 170 Filipinos in Jakarta are on the
waiting list for their Manila flights after they failed to find
space on the last Philippine Airlines return flight to Manila.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 Filipinos are in Jakarta and all of them are safe
so far, Siazon said.
</P>
<P>
Siazon stressed, however, that the Philippine government is not
evacuating Filipinos in Jakarta since there is no need for such
measure despite the widespread and intensifying civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippine Embassy in Jakarta has been placed on
alert and is ready to assist Filipinos who desire to voluntarily
return to Manila.
</P>
<P>
Siazon also assured that the Philippine Embassy staff in
Jakarta will stay at their posts while closely monitoring the
developments in Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Slams India's Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper, the
People's Daily, on Friday blasts India's nuclear test actions,
accusing New Delhi of signaling its ambition to seek hegemony in
South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper's commentary said that India's three underground
nuclear tests on May 11, and two tests on May 13, have greatly
shocked the whole world and gravely upset the neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
In the present world where an absolute majority of countries
have signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), India's
intensive efforts to boost its nuclear forces run against the
world's current themes of peace and development, the commentary
said.
</P>
<P>
What is particularly abominable is that India made China a
scapegoat in its unbridled zest for nuclear development.
</P>
<P>
The commentary pointed out that prior to its nuclear tests,
some prominent Indian political figures repeatedly preached the
so-called "China Threat".
</P>
<P>
Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes first stood out this
way, in an attempt to justify New Delhi's test moves, when he
accused China of being "India's potential threat number one".
</P>
<P>
Other figures followed suit after the tests and alleged that
India's operations were prompted by its distrust of neighboring
states.
</P>
<P>
However, the commentary said, New Dehli had underestimated the
judgment of the people in the world when it played the trick of
shifting the blame for its nuclear tests to others, and was
finally besieged by criticism from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said the so-called "China Threat" was nothing
but a groundless accusation by the political figures.
</P>
<P>
It said the accusation makers could not be unaware of the fact
that China has been dedicated to developing friendly and
cooperative relations with its neighbors, including India, on the
Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and has adhered to its
independent foreign policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
They should also be aware of China's strenuous disarmament
efforts, and that China's military spending has been in decline
against its gross domestic product. Its military spending per
capita is among the lowest in the world, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The accusers should also know that China had actively joined
the nuclear arms reduction efforts in the world and signed the
CTBT.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that based on these hard facts, the
international community has praised China as an important force in
safeguarding peace in the Asia-Pacific region and the world at
large.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that less than a month ago, Fernandes
smiled in satisfaction with the peace and tranquility on the
China-India border while meeting visiting Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
The smile however had now turned into an accusation of "China
Threat". His real intention, the commentary said, was self-evident.
</P>
<P>
What prompted the Indian government to pursue nuclear
development in disregard of the fundamental interests of its
people was nothing but the desire to threaten its neighboring
countries and seek hegemony in South Asia, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said India's pursuit of nuclear test actions
would have grave negative effects on the peace and stability in
the region and the entire world.
</P>
<P>
The recent words and actions on the Indian side, the commentary
said, have also hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and
undermined the Sino-Indian friendship.
</P>
<P>
The commentary noted that the development of Sino-Indian
friendly and cooperative ties conforms to the fundamental
interests of the two peoples and benefits the peace, stability and
development of the region and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the joint efforts of both sides, the bilateral ties
have witnessed steady improvement and development, the commentary
said.
</P>
<P>
It finally called on India to cherish the hard-won achievements in
Sino-Indian relations, and stop uttering words that are
detrimental to the feelings of the Chinese people and doing deeds
that are harmful to bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Peacekeeping Law Under Revision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Japan's House of Representatives
(lower house) adopted a bill on Friday to allow Japanese
peacekeepers abroad to use weapons for self-defense on the order
of a commander, rather than with individual discretion.
</P>
<P>
The bill is an amendment to the current United Nations
Peacekeeping Cooperation Law, adopted by Tokyo in 1992, which
approved Japanese Self-Defense Forces joining U.N. peacekeeping
operations abroad.
</P>
<P>
The existing law, which allowed individual peacekeepers to
decide on the use of weapons, caused concern that arbitrary use
could disrupt the order of a contingent, and endanger lives of
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
The amendment will expand the scope of peacekeeping operations
to include election monitoring, not only by the U.N. but also by
regional organizations such as the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The amendment was sent to the House of Councillors (upper
house) for approval, and is expected to be enacted during the
present parliament session, which ends June 10.
</P>
<P>
Japan has sent its troops overseas on a number of occasions
since the peacekeeping law was adopted.

<HEADLINE> China Denounces Resolutions Adopted By European Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Two resolutions adopted by the
European Parliament on Thursday have poisoned the atmosphere of
Sino-European relations and totally run counter to the trend of
the times, according to Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu
Bangzao.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks here today when asked to comment on the
two urgent resolutions adopted by the European Parliament
Thursday, which denounces China's trafficking in the organs of
condemned prisoners and calls for the United Nations to set up a
commission of inquiry on the matter and to name a special
rapporteur for Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the European Parliament, agitated by a small
number of people, passed the two resolutions which slander China
on the sale of human organs and make irresponsible remarks on
China's domestic affairs in Tibet. And Zhu said China "will never
accept" the call for the European Union to name a special
representative for Tibet and to urge the United Nations to name a
special rapporteur for Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government strictly prohibits trading in human
organs under the law, Zhu said, adding that the so-called
trafficking in the organs of condemned prisoners is "merely
fabrication."
</P>
<P>
The slanderous rumors against China spread by some people in
the European Parliament fully demonstrate their ulterior motives,
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He said Tibetan affairs are purely internal to China, and that
foreign governments, organizations and persons have no right to
interfere.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions adopted by the European Parliament have
seriously infringed upon China's sovereignty and grossly
interfered in China's domestic affairs, which the Chinese
government and people firmly oppose, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu urged the European Parliament to take a responsible
attitude and place no obstacles for Sino-European
relations.

<HEADLINE> Berasategui Enters Semifinal of Italian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Alberto Berasategui of Spain continued
his impressive clay season with a 6-4, 6-2 win over unseeded Brett
Steven, entering the semifinal of the Italian Open here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Berasategui, the 12th seed, broke the New Zealander's serve in
the first game of the match and was never in trouble, only delayed
for one hour by the rain.
</P>
<P>
Berasategui has an ATP tour-high 18 match wins on clay in
1998. In 1994, he even ventured to the final of the French Open.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Michael Chang toppled top seed Pete Sampras for a
quarterfinal match against Alberto Costa of Spain.
</P>

<HEADLINE> World's Largest Jade Poses Problems in Excavation, Transport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese workers are facing a
monumental task in trying to unearth and then transport the
world's largest jade which was found in northeastern Liaoning
Province, an expert said here today.
</P>
<P>
The mammoth colorful jade is estimated to weigh
50,000-to-60,000 tons. Local experts said that the "king of jade"
is very suitable for carving a giant jade sculpture.
</P>
<P>
Just six years ago, residents there stumbled upon a 270-ton
jade in the same area in Xiuyan Man Autonomous County in Liaoning
Province. But they found it difficult to move the jade.
</P>
<P>
After building a special road, the local government transported
it away by a huge truck. Jade carvers used that piece for a giant
Buddha sculpture.
</P>
<P>
The new find, with a diameter of about 30 meters, is more than
100 times the previous largest jade.
</P>
<P>
No machine can lift or load such a mammoth stone, said Guan
Zichuan, the engineer in charge of the project.
</P>
<P>
Workers started excavating the jade last September, but only
one-third of it is visible.
</P>
<P>
Workers expect even greater difficulties as the job proceeds,
said Liu Yaqing, who is leading the excavation. The entire project
could cost 20 million yuan (2.4 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Asteroid Named After Hong Kong Discoverer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- An asteroid has been named after
Joseph Liu Hing-chai, who is the founder and the first curator of
the Hong Kong Space Museum.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Provisional Urban Council of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) said here Friday that the
International Astronomical Union in April his year named the
asteroid Liu.
</P>
<P>
Among the countless celestial bodies in the universe, only
asteroid and comets would be named after their discoverers, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The names would be registered in observatories around the
world and become permanent records recognized internationally," he
added. The Hong Kong scholar has been added to the Who's Who list
of the international astronomical circle.
</P>
<P>
Liu, aged 66, has developed a keen interest in astronomy all
his life. In the early 1970's, he built a private observatory
equipped with a self-designed 32-cm reflecting telescope in the
backyard of his house in Hong Kong. He has taken quite a few
stunning and magnificent lunar and planetary photos, which earned
him reputation in the astronomy circle.
</P>
<P>
He become the first curator of the Hong Kong Space Museum when
it was opened in 1980. Now in California, the United States, he is
still deeply engaged in astronomical observations and
astrophotography.
</P>
<P>
Asteroid Liu moves in the constellation Aquarius during April
and May, and will be at its closest approach to the Earth on
October 2 this year.

<HEADLINE> Time Capsule Marks Completion of HKSAR Government Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Heads of government departments
gathered at the new Hong Kong International Airport here Friday to
place a series of items ranging from a weather logbook to a
passport specimen in a time capsule to mark the completion of the
government's facilities there.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at a ceremony on a site near the air traffic
control tower, Anson Chan, chief secretary for Administration,
said: "The time capsule we are launching today will bear witness
to the collective efforts we have put into the new airport
project."
</P>
<P>
The government facilities including Air Traffic Control Complex
and Tower, Air Mail Center, Airport Police Station and Government
Flying Service Headquarters and meteorological facilities have
cost a total of five billion HK dollars (641 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Chan, who is also chairman of the Airport Development Steering
Committee, said that the fact that the government facilities had
been successfully completed on time and within budget owed much to
the tremendous performance of all those involved -- consultants,
contractors, the Airport Authority and government departments.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a fitting reminder of the vision, dedication and
hard work of the many who have toiled for years on the project,
making it possible for Hong Kong to demonstrate yet again that we
are a city that means business, a community that knows how to get
things done, and to do them well," she said.
</P>
<P>
The first flights in and out of the airport would set the seal
on one of the most outstanding civil engineering feats of the late
20th century, she said, noting also that with the airport coming
on stream some 6,000 new jobs would be created in the services
sector.
</P>
<P>
Taking part in the ceremony were representatives of various
departments and the Airport Authority. Each of them made a
contribution to the capsule which is intended to be opened in 30
years' time.
</P>
<P>
The items contained in the capsule include departmental reports
and organizational charts, a weather observer's logbook, a set of
current definitive stamps, a passport specimen of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region, photograph albums, a Rubik's cube
on import control of animals and plants, health education items
for travelers, and souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was jointly organized by the New Airport Projects
Coordination Office and the Architectural Services Department.

dealing with the effects of the Asian financial crisis and to
making sure that it isn't replicated."

unless there are clear accounting standards and measures of
transparency that countries are prepared to adopt."

his government's hope that the G8 leaders would endorse "specific
measures" to make it easier to combat international organised

position in the stocks, futures, fund management and insurance
markets in Asia," Lam said.
</P>

"Hong Kong's financial services which underpin the overall
strengths of our services sector are and will continue to be a
powerful engine for economic growth -- and recovery -- in the

embezzlement, bribery and dereliction of duty.

people's congresses and various social sectors should be made a
driving force for procuratorial bodies to improve their work.

"That fully demonstrates the respect of procuratorial organs

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Thursday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinians Wednesday marked the 50th anniversary of the
creation of Israel, an event they call the "catastrophe," with two
minutes of silence and several hours of violence during which
Israeli forces fired on crowds and nine Palestinians were left
dead.
</P>
<P>
-- Indonesia's capital descended into chaos on Thursday, as
rioting and looting broke out in virtually every quarter of the
city and the death toll rose. Bands of people swept up and down
Jakarta's main streets, setting fire to cars, shattering windows
in office buildings, and burning and pillaging stores.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- For five years the U.S. military has sent a continual parade
of generals and teams of elite troops to Indonesia in an effort to
gain access and influence within the insular military forces that
dominate the world's fourth-most populous country. As a result,
the U.S. military now has more contact with the Indonesian armed
forces than with any other in Asia, except South Korea's.
</P>
<P>
-- Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms and
21 colleagues, mostly conservatives, introduced legislation
Thursday to provide 25 million dollars a year in U.S. government
humanitarian assistance to the people of Cuba. The aid, which
could be in the form of food, medical equipment or cash grants,
would be channeled to nongovernment organizations in Cuba and
especially to the Roman Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Microsoft's showdown with the Justice Department failed to
materialize as BILL GATES signaled the company is willing to make
concessions to avoid the agency's planned filing of an antitrust
suit. The company agreed to delay the release of Windows 98 until
Monday to give the two sides more time to work out a settlement.
</P>
<P>
-- The Senate Finance Committee voted 10-9 to raise cigarette
taxes by 1.50 dollars a pack over three years, setting the stage
for a likely Senate floor vote next week to approve the
tougher-then-expected tobacco legislation.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Economic Growth Slows Down in Kenya, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The slow pace in Kenya's economic
growth since 1997 continues but can be reversed by the second
half this year, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) says.
</P>
<P>
The state's real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to
have grown by 2.7 percent in the year to February, compared with
the provisional growth of 2.9 percent in 1997, said the May
edition of CBK's Monthly Economic Review available Friday.
</P>
<P>
The fall stems mainly from reduction in agriculture,
manufacturing, tourism and trade, the depressed level of
investment, as well as poor weather conditions in 1997 and early
1998, said the review.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural production is estimated to have declined from the
2.9 percent growth last year to 2.6 percent in the year to
February due to high input costs and unfavorable weather pattern.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino rains which had lasted from October to March
resulted in losses of nearly a quarter of the expected harvest of
maize, wheat, barley and beans, thus necessitating importation of
food in 1998 to cover the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative output of coffee fell by 37.5 percent in the
year to January compared with a decline of 10 percent in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the cumulative output of tea fell 11.5
percent against an increase of six percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Cumulative decline of horticultural crops by 6.8 percent was
observed in the year to January 1998 compared with 12.7 percent
increase over a similar period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Outputs of pyrethrum and sisal were down by 14.2 and 29.6
percent respectively in the year to January 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the impact of the big decline was partly offset by
the substantial hike in the international prices of coffee and
tea that rose by 97.8 and 64.5 percent respectively in the year
to January.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the growth rate of output in manufacturing sector
in the country was down to 2.8 percent in the year to January
from 3.0 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Irregularities in power supply and worsening infrastructure,
general decline in investment due to uncertainty and the high
costs of domestic borrowing, as well as the stiff competition
from cheaper import substitutes, are mainly blamed for the poor
performance of the sector.
</P>
<P>
The CBK said output growth of trade, restaurants and hotels
also went down to 4.1 percent in the year to February, 1998
compared with the expansion of 8.0 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, "the declining trend in economic growth is expected
to reverse by the second half of 1998," the CBK predicted, citing
the sustained favorable prices of the principal agricultural
exports and improvements in tourism, trade and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Recovery in manufacturing is expected at the time mainly on
account of more supplies of cheaper raw materials, especially for
the agro-based food processing, and the gradual opening up of the
U.S. and European markets to products from Africa, said the bank.
</P>
<P>
It noted that performance in the financial sector has improved
since 1997 as a result of continued heavy investment in
government securities that earn high rates of return and enhanced
efficiency with upgraded information and banking techniques.
</P>
<P>
Investor confidence will also be restored particularly with
the expected resumption of 205-million-U.S.-Dollar aid package by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) later this year, the bank
announced.
</P>
<P>
The IMF cut the loans to Kenya under the Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility at the end of July last year, citing rampant
corruption and poor governance in the east African country.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Said to Continue Leading in Philippine Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Vice President Joseph Estrada of the
opposition Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (Fight of Patriotic
Filipino Masses) Friday continued taking a commanding lead in the
presidential election, a private watchdog said here.
</P>
<P>
The National Citizens' Movement for Free Elections (Namfrel),
the sole non-governmental organization accredited by the
Commission on Elections to conduct a quick count of the votes,
said that as of 18:41 local time (GMT 10:41 Friday), Estrada led
with 5,193,236 votes, 36.5 percent of the 14,224,892 votes
counted.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Jose de Venecia, anointed by President Fidel
Ramos as the presidential candidate of the ruling Lakas-NUCD
party, followed with 2,095,802 votes, or 14.7 percent of the votes
counted.
</P>
<P>
In the vice presidential race, Senator Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo
of the ruling party further consolidated her lead with 6,168,682
votes, 43.3 percent of the total votes counted.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of the official counting, some
candidates running for local positions and House representatives
have won the battle in their districts.
</P>
<P>
But generally speaking, the official counting of the votes has
been conducted at a very slow speed. As of Thursday, the
Commission on Elections had not yet received any certificate of
canvass from the provincial level.
</P>
<P>
According to the electoral system, election inspectors at the
precinct level should submit the election returns to the city or
municipality level where the returns are recorded and tabulated on
a certificate of canvass.
</P>
<P>
The certificate would then be sent to the provincial level and
be tabulated on a new certificate of canvass. The new one would
then be sent to the congress for the presidential and vice
presidential positions while the Commission on Elections counts
votes for congress members.
</P>
<P>
The final results of the national elections are expected to
remain unknown for about four weeks. President Ramos and the
Commission on Elections have ordered to speed up the counting of
the votes.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Namfrel Secretary General Guillermo Luz said
Namfrel welcomed auditing by the Commission on Elections of the
election returns tabulated by Namfrel.
</P>
<P>
Luz said the commission could audit Namfrel when the tabulation
is over, but he suggested that the poll body start first with
their documents including copies of the election returns and the
certificate of canvass.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome an audit of the returns. They can audit us when it
is over but we should know the procedure," Luz said.
</P>
<P>
The Commission on Elections said earlier that Namfrel's
tabulation and documents may have to be audited but it did not
categorically say it was doubting Namfrel's quick count
operations.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the 34 million registered voters went to
the polls on May 11 to elect a new president, a vice president, 12
out of 24 senators, 260 members of the House of Representatives
and thousands of local officials and councilors.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Cancels Trip to Democratic Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Friday dropped a scheduled trip to the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) following a cancellation of what was billed as a
security summit of the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese government headed by President Laurent Kabila
Friday postponed "indefinitely" a summit on the security and
development of the Great Lakes region scheduled for Saturday and
Sunday in Kinshasa, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the news agency quoted DRC International Cooperation
Minister Celestin Lwanghi as saying that the decision was
prompted by the "sufficiently serious conflicting situation
between Eritrea and Ethiopia," two of the countries among the 16
invited for the summit.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has broken out near the Ethiopia-Eritrea border, with
each side accusing the other of aggression and territorial
encroachment.
</P>
<P>
Djibouti President Hassen Gouled Aptidon began mediation in
Addis Ababa on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's PM to Consult Politicians on Nuclear Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif has decided to consult the leaders of national political
parties on the situation arising after Indian nuclear tests,
official sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of such consultations is to elicit their opinion in
order to achieve a national consensus on the policy that Pakistan
should adopt to deal with the situation, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They said cabinet ministers have been assigned the
responsibility to meet the political leaders individually.
</P>
<P>
It has been the policy of the government of Prime Minister
Sharif to take into confidence national leaders on issues of vital
national importance, they added.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a high-level U.S. delegation, sent by
President Bill Clinton, is here to discuss the South Asian
situation in the aftermath of the Indian nuclear tests earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, led by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
and General Anthony Zinni, commander in chief of the U.S. Central
Command, arrived here Friday morning. It is expected to meet with
Prime Minister Sharif and other senior Pakistani officials.
</P>
<P>
"The group will be describing the full impact of sanctions
imposed on India by the U.S. and other nations as well as
counseling restraint on Pakistan's part in its response to the
Indian move," said the U.S. Embassy here Friday in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Pakistani Foreign Office has said they would
apprise the U.S. team of the security concerns of Islamabad in the
wake of India's nuclear experiments.
</P>
<P>
"We see this as an opportunity for Pakistan to explain to them
the dangers and destabilization to which the region has been
exposed," he said on Thursday at a weekly news briefing.

<HEADLINE> World Champion Karpov Beats Chinese International Grandmasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- World chess champion Anatoly Karpov
of Russia scored three wins and one draw against four Chinese
men's international grandmasters in the one-on-one quick plays
here Friday night.
</P>
<P>
In more than three hours, Karpov justified his world title with
top-notched skills and witts, beating Ye Jiangchuan, Xu Jun and
Wang Zili in a row before acknowledging a draw with his last
opponent Peng Xiaomin.
</P>
<P>
In the opening quick play, Chinese top player Ye Jiangchuan,
also coach of former women's world champion Xie Jun, initiated his
whites with aggressive attacks by abandoning his knight and bishop
for a strong wave of bullets against king.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Ye failed to stage killing moves under time limit as the
quick play allowes only 25 minutes for each player, and Karpov
managed to survive the critical moments before beating Ye
eventually.
</P>
<P>
Ye said in a post-match interview that "instead of seeking a
draw by exchanging the queens, I, as a player, choosed to exert
all my efforts for a win. I acknowledged the defeat tonight
because I was not on the same level with the world champion."
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, Karpov also played for three wins and one draw
against four Chinese women international grandmasters with the
absence of former world champion Xie Jun.
</P>
<P>
Under the schedule, Karpov will tour to China's northeast city
of Shenyang for a one-on-20 exhibition for the local kids.

<HEADLINE> Rule Changes Introduced by International Badminton Federation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Iternational Badminton
Federation (IBF) decided on its annual general meeting here on
Friday to bring some changes to the current rules for the game.
</P>
<P>
IBF Council member Torsten Berg from Sweden explained to
reporters after the meeting that one of the changes would be about
the settng.
</P>
<P>
From August 1 this year, there'll be one kind of setting only,
setting to three points. In a game to 15 points at 14-all, the
player can choose setting three points to 17, or no setting and
continue to play to 15.
</P>
<P>
Also in ladies singles, he said, there is only one kind of
setting, three points for 10-all only. From 10-all, the player
can choose to play to 11, or to play three points setting to be
13-10.
</P>
<P>
The other important change was about a break between the first
and second games. A 90-second break was to be introduced between
the first two games and coaching will be allowed during the break.
</P>
<P>
The introduction was believed to be favorite for live
television coverage since commercials can be broadcast during the
break.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets with Romanian Senate Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, Chairman of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
National Committee, has told the Chinese government regards
Romania as its important partner in the central eastern Europe
region and sincerely hopes to push forward bilateral relations
on the existing basis.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark during a meeting with Romanian Senate
Chairman Petre Roman here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader said, "China respects the domestic and
foreign policies adopted by the Romanian government and believes
the Romanian people, on the development path chosen by themselves,
are able to build its country stronger and more prosperous."
</P>
<P>
He conveyed to Roman the cordial regards of Li Peng, Chairman
of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Roman said that Romania and China have many identical views
on many international issues and the two countries have huge
potentials in economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The senate chairman said the experiences and achievements made
in China's economic reform, especially in the construction of
economic zones, have attracted worldwide attention and were widely
admired and valued in his country.
</P>
<P>
Roman said that he believes that Li's current visit will deepen
the understanding between the Romanian senate and China's CPPCC
and push forward the cooperation of the two countries in political
and economic fields.
</P>
<P>
Li, the chairman of the top Chinese consultative body, said the
close cooperation between the CPPCC and the Romanian Senate is an
inseparable part of the friendly relations of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li briefed Roman on the main functions of
the CPPCC. He said the multi-party cooperation and political
consultation led by the Communist Party have been defined as the
country's basic political system, and the CPPCC is an important
institution in achieving this system.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived in Bucharest on Thursday for a four-day official
goodwill visit. Romania is the first leg of Li's European nation
tour, which will also take him to Italy, Spain and France.

<HEADLINE> Indian Daily Vilifies Aggressive Nationalism of Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The nuclear tests carried out on
Monday and Wednesday do not signify India`s maturity or its
arrival upon the world as a self-confident and vibrant nation, but
just the opposite, a leading Indian daily said in a signed
commentary.
</P>
<P>
Times of India said in the article entitled "Dangerous
Descent--Flawed Logic of Nuclear Tests" that at the heart of
certain leaders of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is "the
raw power of an aggressive nationalism".
</P>
<P>
The author, Praful Bidwai, termed the tests as "nuclear
sabre-rattling" which "violates every single civilized, sane
principle New Delhi has stood for and defended in the
international arena for half a century", including non-use of
force in relations between countries, opposition to nuclear
terrorism and support for peace and disarmament.
</P>
<P>
There were no strategic reasons for carrying out the nuclear
tests as "there has been no perceptible adverse change whatsoever
in India`s security environment in recent years.
</P>
<P>
If anything, the author explained, there has been improvement
in India`s security environment as a result of better relations
with neighboring Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and most
importantly, China.
</P>
<P>
It is disingenuous for the Indian government to cite
Sino-Pakistani nuclear cooperation as one of the reasons for the
nuclear tests, the article said. The cooperation was of a
sporadic, largely non-strategic, nature and "does not constitute a
serious threat" to India.
</P>
<P>
On the effects of the nuclear tests, the commentary said they
had "lowered India`s stature and earned it suspicion, resentment
and hatred -- not respect -- and not just from the major powers,
but from smaller non-nuclear states".
</P>
<P>
"The reason is that the world is fed up with nuclear testing
and India has gratuitously defied the post-cold war global
momentum favouring nuclear restraint and disarmament."
</P>
<P>
As a result of India`s nuclear blasts, the commentary said, a
billion Indians and a third as many other south Asians now would
live under the shadow of the mushroom cloud.
</P>
<P>
The author urged the government to take measures to contain
some of the damage caused by international sanctions. The measures
included a pledge to never to use or further test nuclear weapons,
nor to deploy them, and to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty.

<HEADLINE> Australia Threaten to Withdraw from Oceania Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Australia threatened to withdraw
from the Oceania Soccer Confederation (OFC) due to a feud between
its top soccer administrator and the region's governing body.
</P>
<P>
Soccer Australia chairman David Hill said Australia was looking
to join another confederation, possibly Asia, because of its
differences with the OFC.

"We've had enough of the insults and being told who can
represent Australia," Hill said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
On his part, OFC president Charlie Dempsey, whose row with Hill
was the heart of the dispute, urged the Australian to reconsider,
saying "we wouldn't want to lose Australia. They are the strongest
country in Oceania."
</P>
<P>
Hill was banned to attend the OFC Congress after he criticized
Dempsey and OFC vice president George Dick in November, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The OFC executive, composed of members from Australia, Cook
Islands, Fiji, New Zealand, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tahiti, Tonga,
Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea, decided that Hill could only be
re-admitted if he apologised which he refused to do.
</P>
<P>
Hill said he had discussed the issue with outgoing FIFA
president Joao Havelange who was to attend the Oceania Congress.
</P>
<P>
Havelange said that Australia was free to leave the
confederation if it wished but he hoped the dispute could be
solved through talks.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Parties Protest Against Nuke Tests by India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Communist Party of
Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) and other leftist political
parties Friday lodged a protest to the Indian Embassy in Nepal
against India's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Bam Dev Gautam, general secretary of the
CPN-ML, read out a letter of condemnation to Indian Ambassador
K.V. Rajan.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly condemn and denounce India's recent nuclear
tests," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
It said that in the backdrop of the ongoing arms race, the
nuclear tests recently carried out by India have further
deteriorated the situation. And in the meantime, it has also
increased the chances of Indian hegemony over South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML is the third largest party in parliament of Nepal
after the ruling Nepali Congress and the opposition Communist
Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), from whom it
broke away in early March.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, a representative of the Nepal Workers' and
Peasants' Party also expressed the party's condemnation of the
nuclear tests by India.
</P>
<P>
The two parties both issued press releases on Thursday,
blasting the nuke tests by India.

<HEADLINE> Number of Overseas Travellers to China Likely to Fall (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The double-digit increase of
China's overseas tourism over the past few years is estimated to
fall below 5 percent this year, as stronger effects from the Asian
financial crisis will be felt in China's tourism market.
</P>
<P>
The results of the first two months have confirmed this, as
shown by statistics that China received 970,000 overseas tourists,
a dramatic drop against the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of visitors from the Republic of Korea, Thailand,
and Indonesia, China's major tourist sources, is expected to
plummet by more than 50 percent due to sluggish economic growths
there caused by the crisis, exerting negative impacts on China's
tourism market, said Wei Xiao'an, director of the tourist service
and hotel management department of China National Tourism
Administration (CNTA).
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some foreign travel agencies, with the approval of the
State Council, are preparing to open solely-funded or cooperative
tourism services in China, and this introduction of international
tourism practices will bring in market competition. And domestic
tourism services are also vying for market shares at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
Wei predicted some 5 percent increase for tourists from Japan,
China's largest tourism source. Normal Sino-Japanese relations in
recent years have helped expand bilateral tourism. Fourteen cities
of the two countries have air flights, and this will be increased
to 26 by the end of the year.

Greater efforts must be made to maintain at least last year's
level as for visitors from Malaysia, which suffered less from the
crisis, said Yang Wenzhen, director of CNTA's market development
department.
</P>
<P>
"In evaluating tourism markets in related countries and working
out our marketing strategies, we should look to the world's
tourism market to find new sources in a bid to achieve balanced
development," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and Russia are two newly emerging markets and tourists
from there are expected to increase by 600,000 to 700,000 this
year.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, more than two-million Taiwanese visited the mainland,
while 800,000 Russians came to China, ranking second in China's
tourism sources. More Russian tourists are expected to visit China
in the future as economy and people's life there improve.
</P>
<P>
Industry insiders say that tourists from China's traditional
markets such as the United States, Britain, and Canada will
continue to increase.
</P>
<P>
China is presenting the 98' China City and Country Tour,
featured by sightseeing of new looks of old cities and country
tours. It will also hold 98' China Overseas Tourism Fair, China
Tourism Jubilee, and some other marketing activities, in an
attempt to attract more visitors.
</P>
<P>
China received 7.43 million overseas tourists last year, a
year-on-year rise of 10 percent.

SHANGHAI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Volleyball Federation
(AVF) has set three major tasks in 1998 as it convened its 18th
excutive board meeting for the first time in China here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
AVF president Yuan Weimin of China, explicated the tasks as to
improve the management of the AVF and its associations, to set up

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Summit Canceled Amid Poor Attendance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- President of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo Laurent Kabila canceled a Solidarity and
Development Summit Friday to mark his first year in power in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He cited border problems between Ethiopia and Eritrea as the
reason.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here quoted Minister of International
Cooperation Celestin Lwanghy as announcing the news in a
statement to reporters in the capital Kinshasa, where the two-day
summit had been scheduled on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kabila had planned the summit to coincide with Sunday's first
anniversary of his coming to power after a seven-month bush war
that overthrew the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
"The organizing committee, to show its solidarity with the two
friendly Eritrean and Ethiopian peoples, decides with regret to
postpone the summit to a date to be fixed," Lwanghy said.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that Ethiopia and Eritrea played a full
part in the preparation, organization and calling of the Kinshasa
summit.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Kabila had invited 16 heads of state to
attend the summit on security and development issues in central
Africa's conflict-prone Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
But diplomats said Uganda and Rwanda, key players in the
region and allies who backed Kabila's rise to power, had pressed
him to cancel.
</P>
<P>
Uganda had already said that its president Yoweri Museveni
would not attend, whereas Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu
could also be a no-show.
</P>
<P>
Congolese officials said tense relations between Tanzania and
Burundi, whose President Pierre Buyoya has been invited, might
also deter President Benjamin Mkapa from coming.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, analysts said a poor turnout would reflect concern in
some African capitals about developments in Kabila's Congo, where
the government is seen as disorganized and erratic. In the east
of the country, rebels and militias are undermining regional
stability.
</P>
<P>
Some leaders were already in town for the summit. They
included South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and Namibian
President Sam Nujoma.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a
grueling 30-year war and the Horn of Africa neighbors enjoyed
good relations until last year.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea Thursday accused Ethiopian militiamen of invading its
territory and said both sides suffered casualties, as a border
skirmish threatened to develop into a full-scale crisis. Enitem

<HEADLINE> Zhongguancun Uses Foreign Funds to Develop High-tech Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Zhongguancun, knowns as "China's
Silicon Valley," has become a model in using foreign funds to
develop non-governmental high-tech businesses.
</P>
<P>
Without a single penny of government investment or loan from
state-owned banks, these high-tech enterprises have focused their
attention on introducing foreign funds to develop their businesses.
</P>
<P>
Taking Beijing Formis Co. Ltd. for example, the company started
to develop computer data base softwares in 1990 with funds from a
U.S. investor.
</P>
<P>
To date, its products have been exported to over a dozen states
of the U.S. and to Canada, Germany and Isreal, and their export
volume has increased from the original 200,000 US dollars to the
current 2.2 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, the registered capital of 920
foreign companies in the area has reached 960 million US
dollars. The overseas-funded enterprises have accounted for more
than 20 percent of the total enterprises in the area.
</P>
<P>
A group of world name brand computer giants such as IBM,
Microsoft and Intel have opened agencies in Zhongguancun.
</P>
<P>
Chinese non-governmental enterprises have also conducted
cooperation with their foreign counterparts and imported advanced
technologies to expand their businesses, in addition to training
personnel with foreign funds.

<HEADLINE> Food Aid to S. Sudan Rises as Rains Set in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) said
Friday that food airdrops to southern Sudan where famine is
biting have increased just in time, as heavy rains have now
begun, rendering many airstrips unlandable.
</P>
<P>
The largest food aid agency in the world now is able to send
in an average of 10 flights a day to airdrop relief food as
compared to two flights daily two weeks ago, said reports from
WFP's emergency air operation cell in Lokichokio, northern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
WFP said it hopes to drop food aid into more than 40 locations
throughout southern Sudan over the next six weeks -- reaching
some 700,000 people facing hunger.
</P>
<P>
However, about 70 percent of dirt airstrips in southern
Sudan's hunger-hit province of Bahr El Ghazal have become
waterlogged and temporarily unusable due to rains over the past
few days, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
This limits WFP's ability to utilize mid-size cargo planes,
which can airlift small quantities of food and supplies, but must
be able to land.
</P>
<P>
Instead the agency will now be forced to deliver virtually all
of its food supplies via airdrop by four large C-130 aircraft
from mid-air.
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that we've managed to get four C-130
aircraft up and running, just in time to allow us to get more
food out to these hungry people," said Claude Jibidar, WFP's
Field Coordinator in Lokichokio, some 25 kilometers away from the
border of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
"But the battle isn't over yet. We still need to be able to
land light aircraft to pick-up staff in the field, and move them
to other locations to help set-up the drop zones and distribute
the food," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We're hostage to the weather right now... And what's
frightening is that the rains make the situation more critical,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Health problems like malaria, cholera and respiratory
infections become more prevalent during the rainy season, and
these people are so weak, they won't be able to fight them off,"
Jibidar warned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the WFP appealed to the international community to
provide 65.8 million U.S. Dollars in funding for aircraft and
food supplies to keep emergency programs going throughout Sudan
over the next 12 months.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Supreme Court Annuls Anti-Terrorist Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Supreme Court on
Friday declared as void the controversial Anti-Terrorist Act 1997,
calling most of its parts invalid and violative of the country's
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the short order, the apex court said most of the
clauses of the act are invalid because they are contrary to the
basic principles of independence of the judiciary as laid down in
Judges Case.
</P>
<P>
However, the five-member court bench, led by Chief Justice
Ajmal Mian, held that those cases where the trial has been
completed and conviction ordered by the special courts would not
be affected.
</P>
<P>
"But the pending cases will be tried subject to the order of
the Supreme Court," it said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Attorney General Chaudhry Farooq representing the
federation in the case told the court that the law was enacted to
eliminate the menace of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The government has no intention to misuse the law, he added.
</P>
<P>
The government under the leadership of Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif enacted the anti-terrorist Law last year amid a series of
terrorist attacks, bomb blasts and sectarian violence in the
country. However, the law came under criticism from human rights
bodies for being violative of internationally recognized
fundamental rights of the people.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Civil Aviation Administration
of China (CAAC) demanded today that 18 Boeing 737 aircraft with
over 20,000 hours of flight time should receive special safety
checks.
</P>
<P>
The order came after the U.S. aviation agency asked airlines to
conduct safety checks on electronic wiring in fuel tanks of Boeing
737s that have been flown more than 40,000 hours.
</P>
<P>
China's airlines have 142 Boeing 737s. By mid-May, none of them
had flown more than 33,000 hours.
</P>
<P>
However, the ordered check aims to ensure flight safety of
those Boeing 737s, CAAC officials said.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Donates to Special National Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and his wife, Siti Hasmah Mohd Ali, have donated
foreign currencies and jewelry worth 125,000 ringgit (33,244 U.S.
dollars) to the Special National Fund, a Treasury official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir donated currencies of various countries worth 15,000
ringgit while Siti Hasmah also gave foreign currencies valued at
40,000 ringgit and a set of diamonds costing 70,000 ringgit,
Treasury Deputy Secretary-General Syed Danial Syed Ahmad told
reporters at the Treasury here.
</P>
<P>
The items would be auctioned soon and the monetary value is
expected to be higher than the actual worth, he said.
</P>
<P>
The buyer of Mahathir's contribution would be given a special
certificate with the prime minister's signature on it to signify
that the items were collections of the country's leader, he said.
</P>
<P>
Syed Danial said Mahathir's contribution should be an example
to the people in efforts to stimulate the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Special National Fund was launched on March 6 to collect
contributions from the public to help the country tide over the
economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
The government appointed Bank Simpanan Nasional as the
receiving agent for local and foreign currencies while Bank Islam
dan Bank Rakyat were charged with accepting valuables.
</P>
<P>
Syed Danial said the fund has received donations in the form of
foreign currencies and jewelry worth 2.6 million ringgit.
</P>
<P>
Due to the encouraging response, collections for the fund,
which were to end on April 6, have been extended till July 6, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He expected the proceeds to touch 1 billion ringgit as other
states particularly Pulau Pinang and Johor are keen to launch the
fund soon.
</P>
<P>
He said jewelry with cultural values like those used for
weddings would be melted and sold to a company in Switzerland when
the gold price goes up and this would be done on the advice of
Bank Negara (State Bank).

<HEADLINE> Russia Seeks Cooperative Ties With Others: Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia wants to develop close
partnerships with the United States, Britain, France, Germany and
other countries willing to establish cooperative ties with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin said this on Friday in an
interview with the British newspaper, The Guardian, before leaving
for Birmingham to attend the G8 summit.
</P>
<P>
Russia's participation in the summit would help create
favorable external conditions for Russia to continue its reforms
and for the further integration of Russia's economy with the
international trade and financial systems, said Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of disarmament, Yeltsin said further arms
reduction in the next century bears great significance on world
stability and security. Thus, he proposed an aggressive attitude
be taken in this regard.
</P>
<P>
On the matter of the eastward expansion of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO), Yeltsin said Russia would take a more
objective stance on this issue.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia insisted on its opposition to Ukraine and the
three Baltic nations' bids to join the military bloc.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Russia's domestic economic situation, Yeltsin for
the first time took the major responsibilities for the country's
stagnant economy.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM Lambasts Israel for Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kaman
Kharrazi has lashed out at Israel for killing Palestinians,
calling on the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) to
implement its resolutions on Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA reported on Friday that
Kharrazi said on Thursday the (Israeli) Zionists who opened fire
on demonstrating Palestinians Thursday are true descendants of
their predecessors who massacred the innocent Palestinians some
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the
establishment of Israel, he said bloody incidents in the occupied
Palestine over the past 50 years are proof that compromise with
the Zionist regime will bring only humiliation to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He called on the OIC member states to abide by the previous
OIC resolutions in connection with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Eight Palestinians were reportedly killed by Israeli army
gunfire and over 200 injured Thursday as bloody clashes marred the
Palestinian "million-man march" in remembrance of their uprooting
after the creation of Israel 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The "million-man" march was organized by the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) with the aim of waking the awareness among
Palestinians of the past pains of Israeli occupation and to raise
the expectation for a better future.
</P>
<P>
Despite the PNA call for keeping calm, the Palestinian marches
quickly turned violent as protesters stoned Israeli soldiers
guarding the settlements and border crossings. Palestinian sources
said eight protesters were killed.

<HEADLINE> Ranariddh Suddenly Leaves for Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's deposed First Prime
Minister Prince Ranariddh abruptly left here Friday afternoon for
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The five-member negotiation team led by General Khann Savoeun
and General Dam Vuthy also left here with the prince.
</P>
<P>
The prince said nothing about his sudden departure. The
reasons were not immediately clear, but it was claimed to be
linked with Friday morning's failure of troop reintegration talks
between his and government negotiating teams.
</P>
<P>
The two parties met Friday morning for the first time at the
Ministry of Defense for talks on reintegrating Ranariddh's
resistance forces into the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF),
but failed to reach any agreement.
</P>
<P>
The troop reintegration talks are crucial to Ranariddh's
participation in the July 26 elections, because law forbids
parties from holding armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The talks are also to meet the last requirement of the
Japanese-brokered peace plan which paves the way for the prince to
compete in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Reintegration of the former RCAF forces, which broke away to
fight against the government after Prince Ranariddh was ousted
last year, may be complicated by the failed negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh agreed on April 17 to give back the area
controlled by the RCAF loyal to him, and appointed General Khann
Savoeun to begin the troop reintegration talks with government
representatives of the RCAF.
</P>
<P>
The prince, a former first prime minister, has been in exile
since his ousting last July by his co-premier, Hun Sen, in the
wake of a military clash.

BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
today expressed the hope that China and Japan would abide by the
principles set in the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and the
Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship to further promote
bilateral good-neighborly and cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries should seize opportunities, take
lessons from history and remove obstacles to achieve greater
progress in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remarks during a meeting with Chinese and Japanese
members of the 21st Century Committee for Sino-Japanese
Friendship, who attended the 12th conference of the committee held
in northwest China's Xi'an city.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president spoke highly of the contributions made by
the members of both sides to the enhancement of Sino-Japanese
friendship.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese President Jiang Zemin will pay a historic
visit to Japan this year, which marks the 20th anniversary of the
signing of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship.
</P>
<P>
Tatsumi Okabe, head of the Japanese committee, told Hu that the
members from both committees have earnestly discussed the issue of
establishing Japan-China ties oriented toward the next century.
</P>
<P>
He said that Japan would seriously follow the spirit of the
Japan-China Joint Statement and the Japan-China Treaty of Peace
and Friendship, keep in mind the lessons in history and stick to
the track of peaceful development.

BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Ji
Peiding reaffirmed here today that the Chinese government will, as
always, support the just cause and legitimate demands of the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
"China will further strengthen cooperation with the Palestinian
National Authority and assist economic development in the
self-rule area to the best of its ability," said Ji at a reception
hosted at the Palestinian embassy to mark the 50th anniversary of
Palestine's occupation.
</P>
<P>
Although the talks between Palestine and Israel are now in
serious difficulty, China still believes that a negotiated
political solution is in the interest of all parties concerned, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process has been stalled since last March
when Israel started building a series of Jewish settlements in
east Jerusalem. All international efforts so far have failed to
produce substantial results, including the recent talks between
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Ambassador to China Mustafa Sapharini called for
more efforts from the international community, especially the five
U.N. Security Council permanent members, to break the stalemate in
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is the strategic opinion of the Palestinian people
because it is the most ideal way to attain their aspirations,"
said Sapharini.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his appreciation for China's consistent
support of the cause of the Palestinian people and their struggle
to win legitimate rights.
</P>
<P>
Farid Samaha, dean of the Arab Diplomatic Corps and Lebanon's
Ambassador to China, and Mohamed El Saket, head of the
Beijing-based Mission of the Arab League, also expressed support
for the Palestinians, saying their legitimate rights should be
restored.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Markets Maintain Average Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Low competition unraveled early
price gains at this week's wool sales and the market saw prices
ease toward the end of the week, exporters said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The market started the week on a very positive note with
fairly significant price rises for finer microns in particular,"
the Australian Council of Wool Exporters said in its weekly wool
report available here.
</P>
<P>
But due to the lack of widespread competition, the average
prices are now almost back to where they started the week.
</P>
<P>
The eastern market indicator gained 2 cents to close at 646
cents a kilogram clean.
</P>
<P>
Although the western market indicator rose 17 cents to finish
at 575 cents/kg, the rise was generally due to prices catching up
after a break from sales in Fremantle last week.
</P>
<P>
About 18.1 percent of the 54,120 bales offered were passed in.
</P>
<P>
"The current market fundamentals essentially remain unchanged,
with the positive factors of relatively limited supplies and a
favorable Australian dollar exchange rate being offset by subdued
demand from overseas customers," the report said.
</P>
<P>
About 74,500 bales are rostered for sale in Sydney and
Melbourne next week.
</P>
<P>
In its weekly wool report, wool broker Wesfarmers Dalgety said
this reasonably-sized offering would test the market.
</P>
<P>
"Price falls are likely due to the lackluster demand that
remains," the report said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Building Recovery Outlook Called Bleak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Parts of the Asian building and
construction industry will begin recovering as soon as next year,
but the outlook in most countries remains bleak, an Australian
market forecaster said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued from Melbourne Friday by market forecaster
BIS Shrapnel, said Singapore and the Philippines will lead a
recovery in the industry by the second half of 1999, but the
majority of nations will see the downturn persist into 2000.
</P>
<P>
BIS Shrapnel said significant oversupply has occurred in most
countries' building sectors and there will be negative growth
across the board in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The other Asian countries mentioned in the report are
Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Of these countries, Indonesia is seen to be in the worst
predicament, with the sector decline in 1998 and 1999 to be 50
percent. "As a result, total building in terms of completion value
will decline significantly in 1998 and 1999."
</P>
<P>
In Malaysia, the report said, overbuilding has caused a glut of
residential, hotel, office and retail buildings and total building
 construction is expected to drop 40 percent in 1998 and 1999,
with work to be confined to existing projects.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand economy is beginning an upturn and the total
value of building will drop slightly in the coming financial year
before a 5-percent improvement in 1999/2000.
</P>
<P>
There has been "severe overbuilding" in Thailand since the late
1980s and the property sector is expected to witness falling
demand over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
"This, combined with excess building stock, will result in
significant declines in construction activity over the next two to
three years," the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, it added that "although the near-term prospect for the
building and construction industry in most of these countries is
bleak following the fallout of the region's economies, compounded
by overbuilding in the mid-1990s, the longer-term outlook is
sound."

HONG KONG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Indonesia
breezed past their first round group competition by trouncing
England 5-0 when the 17th Ubre Cup world women's badminton team
championships opened here Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia won over England five matches to none in Group B's
opening match.
</P>
<P>
It just cost Indonesia's former Olympic and world champion Susi
Susanti 15 minutes to beat her opponent Julia Mann from England
11-0, 11-1 in the opening singles match.
</P>
<P>
"It was a fairly easy match and today was just something like a
warm-up for our team," said Susanti, 27.
</P>
<P>
Susanti's victory helped her team win over England in two hours
and 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Although her expectedly show-down with China's top-ranked Ye

declined to predict the match. "It's still too far away as we had
now to beat the Netherlands team before qualifying for the the
semi-finals," she said.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Promotes Work on Intellectual Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government is
taking measures to enhance its work for the protection of the
intellectual property rights, Stephen Selby, director of
intellectual property of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a meet-the-media luncheon held Friday afternoon, Selby said
that the government is promoting the public education work on
intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Intellectual Property Department (IPD) were
sent to schools to explain to students what is intellectual
property, how to respect the intellectual property and why should
the citizens resist the pirated compact discs.
</P>
<P>
Pamphlets on intellectual property have been published and
offered to citizens by the IPD.
</P>
<P>
Also at the luncheon, Selby briefed the audience on his trip to
Beijing. He said that he had talked with officials of the Central
Government on the issue of intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and the inland areas of China have good cooperation
over the issue of the protection of intellectual property rights
and often exchange information on this issue, Selby said.
</P>
<P>
At the luncheon, Selby also briefed on the preparation for the
forthcoming World Intellectual Property Organization's Asian
Regional Symposium to be held in Hong Kong early next month.
</P>
<P>
Panelists invited to attend the Symposium will include
prominent figures in the field of intellectual property from Asia,
Europe, the World Customs Organization, the World Trade
Organization, the United States and the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
This timely gathering will be an excellent opportunity for
participants to share their experience and benefit from each
other, Selby said.
</P>
<P>
A workshop on International Copyright Title Verification
Database will be organized by the IPD and the Productivity Council
of the HKSAR following the symposium.
</P>
<P>
The workshop will discuss issues related to the development of
an international copyright title verification database, to explore
the existing copyright title verification databases and their
possibilities of mergers.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Airlines Orders 10 Airbus Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Airlines (SIA) said
on Friday it had signed a letter of intent with Airbus Industrie
to purchase ten wide-bodied A340-500 aircraft, five on firm order
and five on option.
</P>
<P>
The purchase order is worth 2.2 billion U.S. dollars, including
the cost of spares and spare engines. The four-engine aircraft
will be powered by Rolls Royce Trent 553 engines. Deliveries will
commence in 2002, SIA said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the A340-500 is a super-long-range aircraft that
can operate non-stop on routes such as Singapore-Los Angeles and
Singapore-San Francisco, which are beyond the capability of
existing aircraft types.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the A340-500's not-stop capability will enable SIA
to take advantage of the open skies air services agreement between
Singapore and the United States and further expand its operations
to the United States, SIA said.
</P>
<P>
SIA currently operates 87 wide-bodied aircraft comprising 49
B747s, 19 A310s, 13 A340-300s and six B777s, with firm orders for
an additional ten B747-400s, 24 B777s, and four A340-300s. The
average age of the passenger fleets it five years and three
months, the airlines said.

<HEADLINE> Tax Free Trade Show Attracts 2,000 Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Tax Free Asia Pacific (TFAP) '98,
which took place for the first time in Hong Kong, concluded
Friday, with 2,000 quality trade visitors attending.
</P>
<P>
Over 62 percent of the visitors were buyers and agents,
according to the organizer, Tax Free World Association (TFWA).
</P>
<P>
"Despite the effects of Asia's economic downturn, we are
pleased with the results of TFAP in Hong Kong this year," said
Jacky Paquet, president of TFWA.
</P>
<P>
"Visitors at this trade show were of a high quality and we have
attracted the very specific industry audience targeted.
Furthermore, a number of exhibitors have confirmed their wish to
come back again next year," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Some 260 exhibitors from over 20 countries and regions
displayed over 350 brands of duty free products at the regional
trade fair, which started in Singapore in 1995 to promote Asian
duty free business.
</P>
<P>
In recognition of Hong Kong's premier status in Asia Pacific
duty free sales and the huge potential of the Chinese mainland
market, TFWA has committed to holding TFAP in Hong Kong again in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Figures showed that the duty free sales of Hong Kong and
China's mainland represented over 1.024 billion U.S. dollars, 16
percent of the industry's sales in Asia Pacific which totaled
6.444 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Earns Over 1.5 Billions Dollars from Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh received a total amount of
1.525 billion U.S. dollars in 1997 as remittance from nationals
working abroad, The New Nation daily reported Friday, quoting
sources of the Manpower Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The remittance was received through the authorized channel
though a huge amount remained unaccounted as sent through other
channels from the Bangladeshi expatriates.
</P>
<P>
The above-mentioned amount was about 30 million dollars less
than that of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The largest concentration of Bangladeshi nationals numbering
around one million was now in Saudi Arabia, and labor export to
that country started with only 217 in 1976.
</P>
<P>
The second largest concentration of the Bangladeshi labor was
in the United Arab Emirates with the number of about 270,000.
</P>
<P>
However, they could not give exact number of Bangladeshi
expatriates as many traveled on their own through various private
channels.
</P>
<P>
The sources observed that Bangladesh's labor export would be
widely affected this year by the recent economic recession in
South East Asian countries.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A stone throwing incident by
Palestinians toward Israelis erupted a short while ago in the
area of Aqsa Mosque near the Wailing Wall in East Jerusalem
Friday.
</P>
<P>
More Israeli police and security forces are rushing to the
scene to maintain order.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Palestinians gathered at the Aqsa Mosque Friday
noon for prayer. For fear of unrests and conflicts between the
Israelis and the Palestinian prayers, Israel has mobilized
additional 1,600 police and security forces in East Jerusalem to
beef up security.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Palestinians gathering at the area of Wailing
Wall suddenly started throwing stones toward the Israelis, who
were there for Friday prayers too, Israeli police said.
</P>
<P>
Any incident or conflict at this area is very dangerous and
Israeli police and security forces have made full preparations, an
Israeli police officer said.
</P>
<P>
The police said there were no reports of injuries from both
sides so far.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians joined the "Million
People March" on Thursday throughout the Gaza Strip and the West
Bank and conflicts with Israeli troops occurred at different
parts of the territories. Eight Palestinians were reportedly
killed and hundreds of others wounded during the march.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Firm Returns for Uganda's Second </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Midroc Ethiopia Ltd., which just
bought the Apollo Hotel Corporation in Kampala, is returning next
week with a definite offer for Uganda's Coffee Marketing Board
Limited (CMBL), the Ugandan Ministry of Finance has said.
</P>
<P>
The representatives from the Ethiopia-based company will
arrive at the weekend to discuss with the privatization unit, a
New Vision report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We are meeting them next week. This is when they will be
presenting their proposal. They have already carried out their
due diligence," the newspaper quoted Leonard Muganwa, Executive
Director of Enterprise Development Project of the ministry, as
saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Muganwa said that the multi-national company did its own
independent valuation of the CMBL in April.
</P>
<P>
Midroc, which sealed the deal to take over the Sheraton
Kampala Hotel on May 6, will be the fourth company to bid for
CMBL since it went on sale in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Two previous bids did not yield any result because the offered
prices were not satisfactory, Muganwa added.
</P>
<P>
Coffee Uganda Ltd. was the highest bidder when the CMBL was
readvertized in 1997 with an offer of 8.6 million U.S. Dollars.
But the company, a joint venture between some Americans and
Ugandans, could not provide guarantees as required by the
privatization unit.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Kills 100,000 Ugandans Yearly: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Minister of Health Crispus
Kiyonga has said malaria kills up to 100,000 Ugandans annually.
</P>
<P>
The minister revealed this at the five-day 51st World Health
Assembly held in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
KIyonga said between 1.5 million and 2.7 million Africans fall
victim to the deadly epidemic each year and that Uganda's infant
mortality rate is still very high in spite of its plunge over the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision newspaper Friday quoted the minister as saying
that some 122 out of every 1,000 live births died in Uganda in
1989 and the figure dropped to 97 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Kiyonga attributed the high death rate to poor sanitation
conditions, citing that only 49 percent of the population is
within five kms of a health unit.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he asserted, Uganda is experiencing an upsurge in
the occurrence of non-communicable diseases like cancer, diabetes
and heart diseases.
</P>
<P>
He appealed for the revision of the formula for the allocation
of World Health Organization's (WHO) regular budget to enable
Africa to get a substantial increase in its share.
</P>
<P>
G.H. Brundtland, the WHO Director General-elect, pledged to
assist Uganda in improving the health standards in the east
African country.
</P>
<P>
She also promised to link African researchers with their
counterparts in the developed countries.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Official: Economic Correction Good for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Government of Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) believes that the economic
correction it is undergoing is good for the territory's long-term
development, a senior Hong Kong economic official said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Tso, Director of Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in
Singapore, said in Bangkok that Hong Kong is now in a period of
economic correction after the economic crisis swept across the
southeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Before Hong Kong's reunification with China on July 1 last
year, the territory saw an increase in property and stock markets
beyond the roof, Tso said.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis came just in time, he said, which brought
the prices of property and stock down to a more reasonable level.
</P>
<P>
"This is important for Hong Kong's long-term competitiveness,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Tso also said with its 97 billion U.S. dollar foreign reserves,
Hong Kong has the ability to defend the Hong Kong dollar against
any speculative attacks.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Hong Kong will stick to the Currency Board
System, which has been properly functioning for 13 years, and will
not let the currency devalue.
</P>
<P>
China and HKSAR contributed a lot to the stability of the
southeast Asian region by pledging not to devalue their
currencies, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tso also mentioned the negative impact of the crisis
on the territory's economy, especially on tourism and social
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in Hong Kong now stands at 3.5 percent, a
sharp increase from the previous 1 to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR government is making efforts to address the problem
by putting money into the infrastructure sector, which includes
not only roads and airport construction but also people's
education and job-creation, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Hong Kong's trade with Thailand, Tso said
bilateral trade has always been good with a double-digit growth
rate in the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two sides will continue to improve, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Singapore is the sole
trade representative of the HKSAR government in the southeast
Asian region.

human being, give advises to the people, and guide the nation from

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Plunges to New 12-year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar Friday
plunged to a new 12-year low of 62.35 U.S. cents as the crisis in
Indonesia continued to spur offshore investors into selling the
currency.
</P>
<P>
"It's all on the Asian troubles, and the fact we are in the
middle of a war zone," said Andrew Le, foreign exchange dealer
with Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
The local unit is now at its lowest levels since September
1986.
</P>
<P>
Le said if the Australian dollar fell below 62 U.S. cents, it
could quickly drop to 59 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The latest sell-off of the Australian dollar came as the crisis
in Indonesia escalated, Le said.
</P>
<P>
Michael Workman, currency economist with Commonwealth Bank of
Australia (CBA), said the local currency's fall was not solely due
to the political and economic upheaval in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He said weakness in Japan, gloomy forecasts for Asian growth,
and an expected fall in world metals and energy prices, the
backbone of Australia's exports was also to blame.
</P>
<P>
"It is just external events, but people offshore determine the
level of the currency, not the people onshore."
</P>
<P>
Workman said the Australian dollar's latest tumble followed
heavy and consistent offshore selling from New York.
</P>
<P>
The CBA forecasts that the Australian dollar will be trading at
61 U.S. cents over the next two months.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar also closed at 83.54 Japanese yen from
84.30 Thursday, and at 1.1155 Deutsche marks from 1.1156.

<HEADLINE> Poland Expresses Concerns Over India's Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Poland was deeply concerned about
India's underground nuclear tests and called on India to stop such
tests and sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
The Indian move was contrary to the efforts made by the
international community on nuclear disarmament and nuclear
non-proliferation, especially on the total ban of nuclear weapons,
said the Polish foreign ministry in a statement on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The tests are not in conformity with the spirit of the
(nuclear) Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), the statement added.
</P>
<P>
It said that the move may cause further delays to the
ratification and implementation of the CTBT, approved by the
United Nations in 1996.
</P>
<P>
And it may set obstacles to the early start of multi-lateral
talks on the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Production of
Fissile Materials Used in Nuclear Weapons and Other Nuclear
Explosive Devices, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Poland also expressed its unease over the possible
negative consequences arising from India's action to the security
in South Asia, including the possible reactions from India's
neighbors and the possible escalation of nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
Poland is worried that the Indian move may jeopardize global
peace and security, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Stock Market's Downward Trend Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Signs of downward trend shown last
week by the Cyprus Stock Market continued this week, since four
out of the five trading sessions saw the market heading
downwards.
</P>
<P>
A report prepared by the Cyprus Investment and Securities
Corporation Limited (CISCO), released here Friday, attributed the
downward trend to the profit taking pressures and political
uncertainty on the island.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps more importantly, a further blow to the fragile
investor psychology dealt by U.S. envoy Tom Miller's comments on
a 'hot summer' in Cyprus ahead, caused investors to hastily exit
the market," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Miller was referring to a Cypriot government decision to buy
Russian-made anti-aircraft S-300 missiles, which will be
delivered in August this year.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the market closed with a marginal drop, ending
the previous week at 457.1 points. On Monday, however, a daily
retreat of 7.5 points induced an adverse climate which lasted
until Wednesday, when the market lost the 440 level and closed at
439.9 points.
</P>
<P>
The CISCO All-Share Index closed Thursday at 444.7 points,
with daily gains of 4.8 points. However, on a weekly basis, the
market registered losses of 12.4 points.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of transactions this week amounted to 10.5
million Cyprus pounds (about 21 million U.S. dollars).

<P>
SINGAPORE, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Share prices reversed their
downward trend to rise on the Singapore market on Friday as the
benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) recovered 20.25

<HEADLINE> 14 Direct-Sale Firms in Tianjin to Change Into Regular Retailers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen out of Tianjin's 27
direct-sale companies have expressed willingness to change into
regular retailers, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, another six of the direct-sale
companies stated that they would no longer continue business
operations of any kind, and their present business licenses will
be cancelled.
</P>
<P>
The remaining seven companies said that they would make
decisions after further consideration, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Local industrial and commercial administrative departments,
which are now busy streamlining companies engaged in the
direct-sale business and making new registrations if requested,
have been trying hard to help concerned companies to overcome
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Direct-sale activities had spread at an alarming rate in China
since they were introduced into the country at the end of the
1980s. By the end of 1995, a total of 163 firms were promoting
direct sales in more than 30 major Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
Because of the rampant cheating and swindling, the Chinese
government has made all sorts of direct sale schemes
illegal. According to the official ban, companies engaging in
direct selling have to wind up their business or apply to change
their license for that of a regular retailer by October 31.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Moving Against World Trend Is Inadvisable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The international community is
deeply shocked and gravely concerned over India's three
underground nuclear tests on May 11 and two tests later on May 13.
</P>
<P>
These tests represent an outrageous move against the world
trend toward a complete ban on nuclear weapons and against the
wishes of the Asian-Pacific countries for peace and stability in
the region. They have been strongly condemned by all the
peace-loving people across the world.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan pointed out in
a statement that India's nuclear tests have violated the common
understanding reached by the international community.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said, "This action by India not
only threatens the stability of the region, it directly challenges
the firm international consensus to stop the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan, Australia and many other countries
have decided to impose sanctions on India.
</P>
<P>
Countries in the Asian-Pacific region or other parts of the
world have all voiced their shock and regret over over India's
tests.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry pointed out what India has done is an
undisguised contempt for the common desire of the international
community for a complete ban on nuclear tests, represents a severe
blow to the international efforts to prevent the proliferation of
nuclear weapons, and will bring about serious consequences to the
peace and stability in South Asia and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the actions of the Indian government have also
encountered the opposition of the peace-loving people in that
country.
</P>
<P>
A leading Indian newspaper, The Hindustan Times, called the
tests "morally shameful and politically foolish." Several other
newspapers urged the government to work for the signing of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) approved by the United
Nations in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Peace and stability are the two major themes of the current
world. Up to date, 149 countries, including China, have signed the
CTBT with a commitment to stop nuclear tests and promote nuclear
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Conducted in defiance of international protests, India's
nuclear tests were clearly designed to serve its policy of seeking
regional hegemony through nuclear threat and becoming a major
military power.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is no coincidence that some prominent Indian
political figures have been sparing no efforts in preaching the
so-called "China threat." They included Defense Minister George
Fernandes who accused China of being "India's potential threat
number one" and Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee who alleged
that India's tests were prompted by the distrust with its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
However, the world does not buy India's accusations. As is
known to the whole world, China has always favored a complete ban
on nuclear tests and a thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
China has also unilaterally and unconditionally promised not to
use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against the non-nuclear
states or the nuclear-free zones.
</P>
<P>
Besides, China, which has been pursuing an independent foreign
policy of peace, has been committed to developing friendly ties
and cooperation with all countries including India on the basis of
the five principles of peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
The international community hopes that the Indian government
will stop moving against the world trend and abandon its dangerous
nuclear programs as early as possible. This will not only benefit
the peace in South Asia but also serve the interests of India's
own development.

<HEADLINE> Color TV Sets in All Urban Households in Tianjin City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Color TV sets are now popularized
in all households in north China's Tianjin city.
</P>
<P>
The latest market survey in the city showed that at the end of
last year, 100 households in the urban districts owned 110 color
TV sets.
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, only 50 percent of the households could afford
color-TV sets.
</P>
<P>
In the rural areas of the city, the color-TV owning rate is 80
percent, compared with 10 percent in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The increase of the household color-TV owning rate went along
with the improvement of people's living standards in the city and
the decline of the prices of color TV sets.
</P>
<P>
Deng Shutian, a manager of a Tianjin-based market consultancy
corporation, said that color TV remains popular in Tianjin and
there is still a great potential in the sales of color TV sets.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than half of the households are planning to
purchase new color TV sets to replace their old ones which have
been used for a decade or more.
</P>
<P>
Many of the households want to buy undated color TV sets with
new functions.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, this year about 220,000 TV sets are
expected to be sold in Tianjin with 90,000 in the rural
areas.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Troop Reintegration Break Down in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The first round of talks held
here Friday morning to integrate the force loyal to Prince Norodom
Ranariddh into the government troops broke down due to the
differences on the composition of the negotiating teams.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which opened at 9:00 a.m., lasted for only ten
minutes.
</P>
<P>
A five-man delegation of Prince Ranariddh's resistance force
was led by General Khann Savoeun, while the government team by
General Dam Vuthy, head of the First Bureau of the General Staff
of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the talks were some foreign military attaches
in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
General Vuthy told reporters after the breakdown that Long
Sarin, a member from the resistance force's negotiating team, was
not a soldier but a former diplomat to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He said the resistance force should make some adjustments in
the composition of its delegation before the negotiations can
resume.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, General Savoeun, who arrived here Wednesday for the
talks, insisted that their team was appointed by Prince
Ranariddh. He would report the results to Prince Ranariddh and
General Nhiek Bun Chhay.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that it was still a success that the rival
parties could sit down to talk after nearly ten months of
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The talks on troop integration are crucial for Prince Ranariddh
to take part in the forthcoming general elections scheduled for
July 26. According to the Cambodian laws and the
Japanese-brokered peace plan, political parties are banned from
having their own armed forces.

HONG KONG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Indonesia
breezed past their first round group competition by trouncing
England 5-0 when the 17th Uber Cup world women's badminton team
championships opened here Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia won over England five matches to none in Group B's
opening match.
</P>
<P>
It just cost Indonesia's former Olympic and world champion Susi
Susanti 15 minutes to beat her opponent Julia Mann from England
11-0, 11-1 in the opening singles match.
</P>
<P>
"It was a fairly easy match and today was just something like a
warm-up for our team," said Susanti, 27.
</P>
<P>
Susanti's victory helped her team win over England in two hours
and 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Although her expectedly show-down with China's top-ranked Ye
Zhaoying had been much anticipated, the Indonesian singles ace
declined to predict the match. "It's still too far away as we had
now to beat the Netherlands team before qualifying for the
semi-finals," she said.
</P>
<P>
Susanti came from behind to win over Ye in the opening singles
match against Ye in the last Uber Cup championships two years ago
in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> India Tries to Develop Reusable Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- India is trying to develop a long
range missile that can be used as many as 100 times and is capable
of carrying a nuclear head, the Press Trust of India (PTI)
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
PTI quoted Chief of Indian Defense Research Development
Organization (DRDO) Abdul Kalam as saying that the reusable
missile is a marriage of aircraft, cruise missile and remotely
piloted vehicle, the technologies for which already exist in
India.
</P>
<P>
Kalam said that the design of such missile is in the conceptual
stage and the DRDO will be ready to make a formal proposal to the
Defense Ministry for funding in the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
Some main characteristics of what he called the "dream missile"
include hypersonic speed and ability to escape detection by radar,
because it will be virtually made of composite material.
</P>
<P>
The missile will use a referential guidance system (RGS) to hit
the target and return to base, a concept that Kalam declined to
explain.
</P>
<P>
"We are working on this and also in the areas of composite
materials and on system engineering and multiple planning," he
said, adding that "the reusable missile will have multiple paths
to carry out its mission and that is where systems engineering
comes in".
</P>
<P>
The missile will employ air-breathing propulsion system called
ramjet and scramjet engines in which air sucked in during flight
will be mixed with hydrogen and burned to produce a thrust pushing
the missile to seven times the speed of sound (5,000 kilometers
per hour).
</P>
<P>
The ramjet engine is already being used in India's Akash
surface- to-air missile, and research in the development of
scramjet engine (in which air compressed at supersonic speed is
used to ignite the fuel) reached a milestone recently with the
first successful ignition achieved at a defense laboratory in
Hyderabad of the south Andhra Pradesh, Kalam said.

<HEADLINE> Cancer-Related Mortality Rising in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China's cancer-control agencies
have predicted a rise in mortality caused by cancer in the next
decade, which currently kills about 1.3 million people a year.
</P>
<P>
About 1.6 million people become new cancer patients and 1.3
million patients die each year, according to the National Office
for Cancer Prevention and Treatment.
</P>
<P>
The office warned that "the mortality will rise to 1.4 million
at the beginning of the next century."
</P>
<P>
Out of every 100,000 people, 135 city dwellers and 107 rural
residents died of cancer last year, compared to 130 out of
100,000 and 104 out of 100,000 in 1996, statistics released by the
Ministry of Health showed.
</P>
<P>
Cancer has replaced cerebral diseases as the No.1 health killer
in Chinese cities, while its hazards to health were next only to
respiratory and cerebral diseases in rural areas, the statistics
suggested.
</P>
<P>
Cancer of the stomach, the liver, the lung and the oesophagus
caused 80 percent of cancer-related deaths across the country.
</P>
<P>
Rapid growth of cases of liver cancer, which has doubled over
the past 20 years, was considered as a direct result of
environmental pollution, overuse of chemical products and smoking.
</P>
<P>
Cancer has caused not only deaths, but also economic loss,
about 143 billion yuan (17.2 billion US dollars) a year, in terms
of labor loss and medical expenditure, according to a national
survey conducted by the Cancer Research Institute under the
Chinese Academy of Medical Science.
</P>
<P>
People of the 35-59 age group are more vulnerable to the
diseases than people of other age groups, the survey
showed.

<HEADLINE> New Method for Oil Extraction Developed in Qinghai Oilfield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed a
new oil-extraction method, using acidifying technology, to
increase oil recovery rate.
</P>
<P>
The method involves using a chemical compound injected deep
into the earth with dehydrated crude oil as a carrier, causing a
chemical reaction to produce a strong solvent to remove blockages
on the inner sides of oil wells, according to sources at Qinghai
Oilfield in northwestern Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
The compound can also decrease the density of crude oil for
better and smoothed extraction, and has no corrosive effect.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese oilfields have had low oil recovery rates and lack
the means to break well blockages.
</P>
<P>
The new method has been applied to 10 wells, and results have
been reported. Six of them increased crude oil output by
approximately 30,000 tons, valued at 26 million yuan (2.4 million
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Scientists estimated that the ratio of investment to return
for the technology is one to eight, and that the rate of oil
recovery can be raised by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The use of the method on most of China's oilfields means a
marked increase in the wells' oil extraction rate and economic
value, industry insiders predicted.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Improves Girls' Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Ghana has been working on the
improvement of girls' education with an aim to remove social and
education inequities "that have made women second-class
citizens", a report reaching here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nara K.A. Rawlings, Ghana's First Lady, told a recent
international conference that as a key resort to the resolution
of the problem, the Ghanaian government launched a free universal
basic education initiative.
</P>
<P>
Popularly known as FCUBE (free compulsory universal basis
education), the initiative aims at a "gradual phasing out of all
parental financial responsibilities by the year 2002," said Mrs.
Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
According to her, a higher percentage of males (84 percent)
than females (69 percent) attend and complete secondary schools
in Ghana.
</P>
<P>
This is partly because of traditional societal standards and
also because of lowered financial support for girls education by
the government.
</P>
<P>
Pregnancy also is a major reason why teenage girls do not
complete school, the first lady added.
</P>
<P>
At one time, she said, the government made parents financially
responsible for educating their sons and daughters. But today,
some parents, especially the poorer ones, are unable to pay the
rising educational costs and must keep some of their children,
usually girls, at home.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the government introduced the FCUBE initiative, which
however presents the government with a "formidable task", Mrs.
Rawlings said.
</P>
<P>
Strategies it has pursued include hiring more female teachers
to act as role models for girls, programing a curriculum that has
more "relevance to girls' interests and aspirations," and
increasing community education and participation in the process,
she said.
</P>
<P>
She underscored the importance of community participation in
education, pointing out that parents who participate in education
are more likely to insist that their daughters stay in school.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ghanaian First Lady, the government has since
1987 adopted education reforms that have "integrated all male and
female students into two principal studies -- technical and life
skills" in a bid to change the societal attitude that discourages
girls from entering the science and technology fields.
</P>
<P>
By establishing a two-week science and technology clinic for
girls, the female students have an opportunity to interact with
female scientists.
</P>
<P>
They are also given access to visits to industries and
institutions of higher learning to gain a "knowledge of job
opportunities in science and technology area", she said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, held in the Ghanaian capital Accra
recently, focused on mobilizing leaders from the public, private
and non-profit sectors to advance girls' education.
</P>
<P>
The first ladies of the United States and Peru were present at
the conference.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Bring Local Government to Court in Tiger Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Three farmers in northeast
China's Jilin Province lodged a law suit against the local
government demanding compensation for their three cows taken by a
Siberian tiger in the Changbai Mountains early this year.
</P>
<P>
Wang Haiyun, a noted lawyer speaking for the three farmers,
submitted Thursday the suit to the people's court of Jiaohe city
where the incident happened, asking the city government to
compensate them with 6,000 yuan (720 U.S. dollars) for the loss.
</P>
<P>
Yu Zhanjun, vice president of the Jiaohe People's Court, said
his court has accepted the case.
</P>
<P>
Four judges went to Huangsongdian town, site of the incident,
yesterday afternoon for investigation.
</P>
<P>
Yu claimed that the court will handle the case according to
law. He revealed that it is the first time for his court to
handle a case of the kind.
</P>
<P>
The Jilin provincial people's congress adopted a regulation in
1996 which says that local governments will have to compensate
those suffering losses for the protection of endagered wild
animals. But it lacks details for legal operation.
</P>
<P>
Li Yi, one of the three farmers, said: "I do not care how much
the local government will pay as compensation though I lost a
cow. What I want is to get things right."
</P>
<P>
"The thing is," he stressed, "what if tigers in the wild do
more damage, say on man, and we are not allowed to hurt them in
the days to come."
</P>
<P>
"We want to seek a legal guarantee for our farmers through the
handling of the case," he added.
</P>
<P>
The three farmers were given all sympathy. However, the country
only has a law for the protection of endangered wild enimals and
lacks related regulations.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jiaping, vice mayor of Jiaohe city, said the local
government should protect the rights and interest of farmers. At
the same time, the law should be improved to meet the new
situation.
</P>
<P>
"What the local government should do in a case a wild bear eats
a cow or a snake bites a man? How much the compensation if
necessary? Where does the government get the money to compensate?"
he asked.
</P>
<P>
So far, the two sides now agree on one point: the Siberian
tiger should be protected. Since August 1997, at least 12 cows
were eaten by wild tigers in the Changbai Mountains. A United
Nation's funded investigation found that four-to-six wild tigers
are residing in the Jilin part of the Changbai Mountains.

the canvassing are still going on."
</P>
<P>
Another purpose of the meeting, he said, is to get an overview
from the Commission on Elections and the National Citizens'
Movement for Free Elections of the actual situation in the

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Lamas Learning English And How To Use Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The English language and computers
have now entered the daily life of Tibetan lamas at Labrang
Monastery in China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
"Without the use of foreign languages, we can't explain
Buddhist history and culture to foreign pilgrims," said one old
lama, who explained that learning another language allows them to
communicate with and understand the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Labrang is one of the six major Tibetan Buddhist monasteries
and receives 10,000 foreign visitors each year. Because the lamas
there often need to deal with foreigners, many of them learn
English from foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
Sanggyai, a young teacher at the Gansu School of Buddhism at
the Monastery, entered the foreign language department of Beijing
University last year to learn English himself, and the study of
English has become somewhat voguish among young lamas here.
</P>
<P>
The lamas at Labrang are also ahead in the use of computers
among Tibetans in the southern part of Gansu. The computers are
used to store documents and for teaching, says Jimba, a lecturer
in philosophy at the School.
</P>
<P>
Labrang differs from other scenic spots in China because it has
no professional tour guides. Instead, the lamas explain history
and culture to tourists.
</P>
<P>
A young lama named Gyayang started working as a part-time tour
guide nearly five years ago when he was studying Buddhist
literature at the monastery. He said he wants to explain Tibetan
Buddhist culture in English to visitors in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Rural Surplus Laborers Benefit from Labor Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Surplus rural laborers in Gansu
Province in northwest China are leaving their homes not to
beg as they used to, but to look for jobs elsewhere to earn a
better living.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhengxing, a farmer in Gulang County, is one of such
laborers. He began his migration career in the early 1980s, doing
all kinds of jobs at construction sites in other provinces. In so
doing, he acquired good building skills, and later he went to
study architecture in a local college at his own expenses.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he went back to his home county, and set up a
construction company of his own. Now, his company employs more
than 400 migrant workers, and generates 1.5 million yuan in
pre-tax profits a year.
</P>
<P>
The number of outstanding migrant laborers like Li has reached
42,000, according to Peng Quanguo, director of the Provincial
Labor Service Office.
</P>
<P>
Gansu started migration labor service in 1986. By now, it has
organized nearly 15 million surplus rural laborers to work
elsewhere, earning more than 10 billion yuan from services.
</P>
<P>
Another example is Zhao Lujun in Tianshui City. He worked in a
clothing factory in Beijing as an ironer and a warehouse keeper,
and gradually he became skilled in dress making and computers. Now
he works in the factory's administrative office, and was chosen as
one of Beijing's 10 most outstanding migrant workers in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.64 million rural families have eliminated poverty
through migrant labor service in the past 12 years, and 310,000
laborers have come back from cities and opened businesses in their
villages.
</P>
<P>
The province's well-organized labor service has won a good
reputation in other provinces. It has opened 27 labor service
agencies across the country, employing a total of 2,800 people.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to provide 2.5 million laborers annually by
the end of century to earn three billion yuan annually from
labor services, Peng said.

for the poor such as water and sanitation, primary preventive and
promotive health services, primary education and capacity
building for delivery of these services.

in Kenya.

NANJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Nanjing, capital of east China's
Jiangsu Province, has opened a botanical garden specially-designed
for the blind.
</P>
<P>
Situated in the Zhongshan Botanical Garden, the
12,000-square-meter garden has collected more than 150 sorts of
typical plants which can be smelt and touched by blind persons,
such as sweet osmanthus, fatsia decne, victoria lindl and
nymphaea.
</P>
<P>
When it was opened early May, more than 60 blind students
visited the garden.
</P>
<P>
As they walked along a stainless steel fence, they stepped upon
a cobblestone path, which reminded them of some plants for them to
"watch".
</P>
<P>
The students stopped and reached out their hands to touch a
plate with braille. They pushed a button on the top of the plate
and then a recorder began to speak, telling them something
about the plants in front of them.
</P>
<P>
In such a way, the blind can learn a lot about the plants.

<HEADLINE> Controlling Industrial Pollution in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Environmental
Protection Bureau reports that industrial pollution in the city
has been reduced in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Gas emissions, water and solid waste are 40 percent less than
five years ago, bureau officials say, and this is unusual, because
in the past century Shanghai has grown into China's largest
manufacturing center.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, it has spent 30 billion yuan (3.6 billion
U.S. dollars) each year on technological improvements in old
enterprises. In addition, three billion yuan was spent annually to
control industrial pollution.
</P>
<P>
While boosting high-tech industries like automobiles,
electronics, and telecommunications, the city also cut back heavy
polluters like electroplating, and paper and leather production.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, more than 1,000 enterprises that were
heavy polluters have been closed or removed.
</P>
<P>
Government sources say that the municipal economic and trade
commission has worked out a pollution control plan for the next
three years to ensure that pollutants are reduced further while
the city remains rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, total industrial output in Shanghai was 302.6 billion
yuan, twice the 1990 figure.

<HEADLINE> Ample Vegetable Supply for Desert City Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Golmud, a desert city
in northwestern Qinghai Province, are have ample fresh vegetables
supply all year round, thanks to application of agro-technology.
</P>
<P>
Located on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Golmud is an emerged city in
the Gobi desert in the wake of the development of Qaidam Basin. In
the past, it was only a dream of Golmud residents to have fresh
vegetable in the long winter-spring seasons.
</P>
<P>
In order to increase vegetable supply, local agronomists
started from the period of 1960s-1970s to experiment green-house
vegetable growing, which was promoted in a massive way in mid-late
1980s.
</P>
<P>
At present, the city boasts more 267 hectares of vegetable
plots plus 27 hectares of vegetable green houses, which are able
to turn out a total of 11,000 tons of vegetables, enough to cope
with half of the need of the city with a population of
200,000. The other half of the need is met by the supplies of
vegetables bought in from elsewhere in China.
</P>
<P>
Vegetable growing has brought fortunes to growers who have come
from all over the country. Feng Xiaoming, who settled in Golmud
over 20 years ago, told reporters that he and his wife can earn
10,000 yuan (1200 US dollars) from vegetable growing a year.
</P>
<P>
Tan Fubang, who came to Golmud in 1993 practically
empty-handed, reclaimed hilly slopes and grew vegetables. Now he
has built a three-room house and bought TV set, sofa and other
household appliances and furniture.
</P>
<P>
"We can buy whatever vegetable we want," a 40-year-old
housewife told reporters at a vegetable market.

<HEADLINE> China to Mass Produce Potassium Sulphate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A breakthrough has been made in a
decade-long research project to industrialize production of
potassium sulphate in northwest China's Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
Golmud Chemical Salt Industry Co., Ltd. has so far processed
6,000 tons of potassium sulphate, 80 percent of which are quality
products. This indicates that China is getting ready to develop
potassium sulphate industry on a larger scale.
</P>
<P>
The country lags behind in potassium sulphate production
technology, and had to rely on imports of the chemicals for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, scientists at the province's Salt Lake Research
Institute conducted an industrial test to produce 10,000 tons of
potassium sulphate, by using rich salt resources in the Qaidam
Basin.
</P>
<P>
Five years later, the institute succeeded during its
intermediate test in making potassium sulphate using carnallite in
salina and natural anhydrous mirabilite, and then the company set
up a workshop capable of turning out 10,000 tons of potassium
sulphate annually.
</P>
<P>
Potassium sulphate, an important raw material for the chemical
industry, is often used as non-chlorine fertilizer for such crops as
citrus, tobacco, and tea.

<HEADLINE> 2 Factories Ordered Closed in Kenya Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
instructed two factories in Machakos District to close down in
order to curb environmental pollution, the Kenya Times reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Following a fact-finding tour of suspected environment
polluting industries in the district, Francis Nyenze, Minister
for Environmental Conservation, Thursday ordered the closure of
the Kenya Fish-meal Ltd. and Babar Tannery.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister gave the Athi River Mining Company a
one-week ultimatum to rectify their level of pollution or risk
closure.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that experts from the Ministry of Water had
established that the two factories discharged toxic effluents
into Athi River causing toxic pollution.
</P>
<P>
The minister also noted that the working conditions at the two
factories were so hazardous that no human being could work there.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the two factories came in the wake of the
minister's pledge last month to ensure strict adherence to
industrial laws on environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
Nyenze stressed that local industries would have to undergo an
environmental impact test and be subjected to continuous
monitoring by his ministry to curb pollution.

<HEADLINE> New Technology May Help Cancer Forecast: Chinese Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists plan to develop
a new technology and use it to test cancer cells or "signals" of
cancer development, such as mutated gene, hoping they can forecast
cancer in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
The scientists believe that slight changes may occur in gene,
protein and ferment while a tumor is developing in the human body.
</P>
<P>
According to the degree of mutation or the density of cancer
cells in blood, researchers can tell whether a person will have
cancer or whether he has entered the early stage of the fatal
disease.
</P>
<P>
However, the mutation and the density are so small that only
equipment with high sensitivity can monitor.
</P>
<P>
"Development of photoelectric, sensor and biological technology
provides the possibility for conducting successful research, "
said Prof. Wu Min, who initiated the research plan.
</P>
<P>
The scientist, who is at the Cancer Research Institute of the
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, said the research aimed to
establish a set of biological criteria and testing measures.
</P>
<P>
The research will have chemists, physicists and medical experts
involved, and will get five million yuan in financial aid from the
National Natural Science Fund Committee.
</P>
<P>
The research is expected to benefit people whose
vulnerabilities to cancer are much higher than others, such as
smokers and people whose families have a history of suffering from
cancer, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that that, in the future, doctors can judge whether a
person has cancer shortly after testing his or her blood sample,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Wu, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
pointed out that conducting cancer forecast was very important to
cancer prevention and control in China.
</P>
<P>
Cancer has become one of the leading causes of deaths in
China. About 1.6 million people become new cancer sufferers and
1.3 million die of it every year.
</P>
<P>
Cancer has replaced cerebral diseases as the No.1 killer in
Chinese cities.

<HEADLINE> Bowmen, Horsemen Discovered Among Terra Cotta Warriors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A troop of terra cotta bowmen will be
brought to light from its burial site in the mausoleum of China's
first emperor at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists say that terra cotta horsemen and chariot troops
were found at the same site. The digging began in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have found clear marks of bamboo mats and reed
mats in the mud layer.
</P>
<P>
In the top layer of dirt, archeologists also discovered
footprints of the laborers, as well as fire ash, tools, and
wheel-tracks left in the construction process.
</P>
<P>
The relics that have been unearthed so far are in good
condition. "The findings are of great value for academic
research," a local researcher said.
</P>
<P>
The terra cotta warriors were buried along with Emperor Qin
Shihuang (210-206 B.C.), founder of the first Chinese imperial
dynasty, as his netherworld guard.
</P>
<P>
The terra cotta warriors were discovered in 1974 and opened to
the public five years later.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the archeological digging is focused on the
bowmen battle array in the northeast part of the pit. Then it will
turn to the horsemen battle array in the north part of the pit.
</P>
<P>
The mixed troops in the east and the chariot troops in the
south will be excavated in the final stage of digging.
</P>
<P>
Usually, excavation starts from the edge of the pit, which also
facilitates sightseeing.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi Province in north China is
promoting five new tour routes in a bid to tap abundant resources
of its own and other regions.
</P>
<P>
The first route, dubbed as the "China Wonders Tour", connects
the spectacular Waterfall of the Yellow River at Hukou in Shanxi,
with terra-cotta soldiers of the tomb of China's first emperor,
Qin Shi Huang in the neighboring Shaanxi, and the Great Wall at
the Badaling Section in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The second route features Wutai Mountain, a top Chinese
Buddhist resort in Shanxi, and two other major Buddhist mountains
of Putuo and E'mei, respectively in Zhejiang and Sichuan provinces.
</P>
<P>
The third one, to track down the ancestral root of the Chinese
nation, leads tourists to ancient sacrificial altars in Shanxi,
Shaanxi and Henan provinces, including the Grand Chinese
Scholartree in Hongdong County, Guandi Temple in Yuncheng, and
Huangdi Mausoleum in Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
Another tourist route is mapped out for travelers to a number
of ancient architecture masterpieces such as the Wooden Pagoda of
Yingxian County and the Suspended Temple of Hengshan Mountain,
both in Shanxi province.
</P>
<P>
And the last route is designed to cope with the needs of
tourists both at home and overseas who are interested in the
history of modern Chinese revolution, taking them to several
revolutionary bases set up by the Communist Party-led troops
during the period from 1930s to 1940s.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions Force Indian Government to Rework Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- International sanctions following
India's five nuclear tests on Monday and Wednesday have forced the
Indian government to rework certain proposals of the coming budget
for the financial year 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Times daily here reported Friday that the Indian
Finance Ministry was "fine-tuning" the budget in order to factor
in the implications of reduced financial flows from the United
States, Japan and other developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Indian top leaders as saying, customs duties
were being reworked, but "the reworking is only on the margins."
</P>
<P>
Sources here said the changes would be minimal as economic
fallout of the five tests had already been factored in the
pre-test reviews. "A one to two percent difference is hardly out
of line," they added.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that the reworking parts of the budget might
include a larger defense outlay than what was originally proposed.
</P>
<P>
The budget is scheduled to be submitted to the parliament on
May 27 for debate and approval.

</P>
<P>
Speaking to parliament, Patrizia Toia, undersecretary of

He added that Italy has already suggested that a European Union
delegation at the ministerial level be dispatched to India.
</P>
<P>
He said Italy will also urge other international organizations
to adopt measures and help realize the goal of a worldwide test
ban regarding nuclear weapons.

BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China's armed forces recently tried
to pack a whole field hospital into several containers.
</P>
<P>
Military surgeons can perform emergency operations and medical
check-ups in those containers, which also include a headquarters,
communications center, medicine and appliance storage.
</P>
<P>
Under all conditions, even at sea, the hospital with hundreds
of beds could easily be transported and built within a couple of
hours, said a senior officer from the Chinese Military Academy of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Chinese medical officers traditionally used first-aid kits to
treat those wounded on the battlefield and carried medical
appliances on groups of vehicles. In the past, horses were even
used for loading medical appliances.
</P>
<P>
The up-to-date equipment could effectively reduce casualties
among soldiers in battle, experts estimated. In addition, the new
equipment has been tested in numerous military exercises.
</P>
<P>
The officer said that the Chinese armed forces have built a
modern medical protection network covering the army, navy and air
force.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Set Terms for Operation by U.S. Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has made
it clear that the U.S.-proposed Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)
might be considered only within the framework of several memoranda
of understanding to be signed between the two countries on
non-combatant joint exercise and relief operation by American
forces in the country, The Independent daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka had rejected two provisions of the proposed SOFA -- free
access to the U.S. military officers in Bangladesh during the time
of any operation without going through the hassles of immigration
check and movement of equipment of the U.S. soldiers, including
military hardware and postal materials, without being subjected to
inspection, it quoted a Foreign Ministry source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government might agree to sign a MOU for joint
exercise and relief operation by U.S. forces in time of need if
the U.S. government did not press for accepting the above
conditions, the source said.
</P>
<P>
There was no progress on this issue, the newspaper quoted
Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad as saying after his
meeting with the U.S. ambassador in Dhaka Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Operation Sea Angel in 1991 was done through a separate
MOU while last year the forces of the two countries held joint
non-combatant exercises under a separate MOU, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the U.S. was trying to obtain legal cover

under any MOU either for joint exercise or for any other
operation, the source observed, adding the SOFA would seek to make
it clear whether the status of the U.S. troops would be like that
of a technical person or a diplomatic or any other government
official in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The SOFA would come into effect only after U.S. troops would
come to Bangladesh on any assignment under an MOU, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, South Korea, Japan and Kazakhstan have already signed
such agreement with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. armed forces have extended their activities in the
Indian Ocean, and recently they held a large-scale joint exercise
with the Australian forces in the Indian Ocean, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka was recently selected for setting up a training center
for the United Nations peace-keeping forces with the U.S. as one
of the main promoters of the peace-keeping operation. After the
training center was set up, the movement of U.S. forces to and
from Bangladesh would increase, it added.

<P>
BANGKOK, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Thai banks closed they branches and
representative offices in Jakarta both temporarily and permanently
to flee the chaos in Indonesia, according to a report here Friday.
</P>

employees to Thailand. TMB is currently selling its assets in
Jakarta.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders to Inspect Newer Boeing 737s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) on Thursday ordered operators to inspect
within 45 days newer Boeing 737s for possible fuel-tank wiring
problems.
</P>
<P>
The FAA's new order includes inspections on 737s with 30,000 to
40,000 flight hours for damaged wire insulation in the wing
tanks. All previous inspection orders applied to planes with more
than 40,000 hours.
</P>
<P>
The FAA also revised its inspection program for the oldest 737s
to include inspection on the wiring around their center fuel tanks
in the next five days.
</P>
<P>
It had excluded wiring around the center tanks when emergency
exams were ordered last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of inspections to the newer planes would increase
the number of planes affected to 651 U.S.-registered planes from
292 previously.
</P>
<P>
The FAA on last Sunday grounded 737s with over 50,000 hours
until the wires passing through metal conduits to the main pumps
feeding the engines were checked and repaired.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday it also ordered airlines to inspect until the end of
next week 737 series 100 through 500 models with between 40,000
and 50,000 hours.
</P>
<P>
The FAA accelerated its action with an inspection order last
week when a 737 was found to have a fuel leak caused by sparks
punching two holes through the metal conduit and the discovery of
a second plane with evidence of arcing between the wires and the
conduit last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Inspection reports show that over half the older 737s have some
noticeable wire damage.
</P>
<P>
FAA and Boeing engineers believe engine vibration over many
thousands of hours shakes the wire in the conduit until a
protective Teflon sleeve and insulation wear through.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senator Jesse Helms Proposes Aid for Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senator Jesse Helms,
co-author of the anti-Cuba Helms-Burton Law, proposed Thursday a
100 million U.S. dollar humanitarian aid package of food and
medicine for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Under Helms' proposal, supported by both Democratic and
Republican lawmakers, the four-year aid will be channeled through
nongovernmental organizations in Cuba such as the Roman Catholic
church and independent relief groups like Caritas.
</P>
<P>
The bill also proposed that President Bill Clinton would have
to increase efforts to support democracy in Cuba, including
starting radio and television broadcasts from the U.S. military
base at Guantanamo Bay.
</P>
<P>
The broadcasts by Radio and TV Marti from Miami designed to
oppose the Cuban government were jammed by the Cuban authorities.
</P>
<P>
Helms and House Representative Dan Burton initiated the most
controversial Helms-Burton bill which was enacted as law in 1996.
The law, which punishes a third country doing business in Cuba,
was strongly condemned worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The new legislation, Helms said, would not loosen the U.S.
economic embargo on Cuba but would change U.S. policy by moving
from isolation of the Cuban government to active support of those
trying to change Cuba.
</P>
<P>
In March, the Clinton administration decided to ease some
sanctions against Cuba, allowing direct flights and letting
U.S.-based family members send up to 1,200 U.S. dollars a year to
relatives in Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Austria: EU Should Play Bigger Role in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Foreign Minister Woflgang
Schuessel said Thursday that the European Union (EU) should play a
bigger role in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The EU should not only continue its economic aid to Palestine,
but also pay special attention to security issues in the Middle
East region, Schuessel said.
</P>
<P>
"We should not separate political and economic issues," he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel made the remark at a joint press conference with
visiting EU Middle East envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos. Moratinos
was in Vienna for policy coordination since Austria is going to
resume the rotating EU presidency in July.
</P>
<P>
It is for the United States, the EU and the United Nations to
coordinate their efforts in rejuvenating the Middle East peace
process, Schuessel continued.
</P>
<P>
As the president of the EU, Austria will push the EU to pursue
a comprehensive security program in the Middle East, with
employment, social and economic elements included, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said it is necessary for the EU to help negotiate some
confidence measures in the Middle East and to establish a
strategic partnership with the region.
</P>
<P>
Britain, as the current EU president, has done little in
promoting the Middle East peace process in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and French
President Jacques Chirac, Moratinos has asked the United States,
the EU and the United Nations to coordinate their efforts into
breaking the ice in the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Report: Interests Groups Cash in on Transportation Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A study released Thursday by a
citizen watchdog group shows special interests that stand to gain
from transportation bills in U.S. Congress have donated large
amount of money in political contributions over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The report by Common Cause says the campaign contributions have
come from labor unions, construction companies, and automobile,
insurance, petroleum and trucking interests, all of which could
gain from bills in Congress that currently total more than 214
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The White House has said that President Bill Clinton will veto
a bill that is too costly. Clinton has proposed a 175
billion-dollar bill. An unlikely coalition of fiscal
conservatives, taxpayer watchdog groups and environmentalists also
are critical of the transportation legislation.
</P>
<P>
Common Cause reports the top political contributors in the
transportation lobby during the past decade include Laborers
International Union of America, International Union of Operating
Engineers, Associated General Contractors of America, American
Trucking Associations, and Ashland, Inc.
</P>
<P>
Common Cause President Ann McBride said in a statement: "No one
questions the legitimate need to repair our infrastructure, but
these bills go way over the top, busting the budget and
potentially forcing the Congress to cut other programs. Such
excessive spending isn't about meeting our nation's infrastructure
needs, it's an exercise in politics, pork and power."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Home Prices Pick Up in Metro Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Home prices in many metropolitan
areas across the United States are picking up, the National
Association of Realtors reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the median home price increased to 125,900 U.S.
dollars during the first three months of this year, up 5.4 percent
from the same period of 1997, according to the association.
</P>
<P>
Of 134 metropolitan areas surveyed, only 10 reported price
declines from the first quarter of 1997 to the first quarter of
this year. One, Canton, Ohio, reported no change.
</P>
<P>
However, 21 areas showed gains of 10 percent or better, led by
Champaign, Illinois, up 18.4 percent to 90,600 dollars; Bradenton,
Florida, up 15.8 percent to 100,200 dollars; and Lansing,
Michigan, up 15.3 percent to 95,500 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other areas with big gains were Omaha, Nebraska; Charleston of
South Carolina; Louisville, Kentucky; Gary, Indiana; Ocala,
Florida; Detroit; Orange County, California; Charlotte, North
Carolina; and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
The biggest declines came in Honolulu, down 8.1 percent to
288,500 dollars. Analysts attributed the decline to fallout from
Japan's long slump and, more recently, to economic turmoil
elsewhere in Asia.
</P>
<P>
By region, gains were best in the South, up 8 percent to
111,100 dollars. Prices rose 6.4 percent in the West to 163,500
dollars, 5.8 percent in the Midwest to 108,000 dollars and 5.4
percent in the Northeast to 125,900 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The best increase in the West came in Orange County. In the
South, it was Bradenton, Florida; in the Midwest, Champaign, and
in the Northeast, Boston, up 11.9 percent to 205,200 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The area with the highest median price in the first quarter was
San Francisco, 303,600 dollars. The lowest was Waterloo of Iowa
state, 63,600 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Currency Weakens Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's currency rupee has
weakened by 1.1 rupees against the U.S. dollar after maintaining a
three-months stability.
</P>
<P>
Nepal Rastra Bank, the country's central bank, Friday refixed
the buying and selling rates of the dollar at 64.20 rupees and
64.80 rupees respectively from Wednesday's 63.10 rupees and 63.70
rupees.
</P>
<P>
The Kathmandu Post said that the rupee fell to 64.20 against
one dollar when the foreign exchange market opened Thursday
morning, and dipped further in the afternoon, but closed at 64.20
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate is expected to remain volatile for the next
week, the daily quoted Chairman of the Foreign Exchange Dealers'
Association N.K. Bahanayake as saying.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation of the Nepali rupee came after the weakening
of the Indian rupee sparked by strong international reaction over
India's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali rupee is pegged to the Indian rupee at a fixed rate
of 1.6:1.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Backs Bulgaria's bid for NATO membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is seriously backing Bulgaria
in its bid for the membership of North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), visiting Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Without Bulgaria, NATO is not complete and the circle is
broken," Cem said at the end of his two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Although Turkey had proposed to base the future Balkan
multinational force in its city of Edirne, it would not mind if
Plovdiv, Bulgaria's second largest city, were chosen, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mikhailova said if Plovdiv
were picked with Turkey's backing, this would show tangible
support for Bulgaria's NATO bid as it would facilitate the
Bulgarian Army's adjustment to the standards of the military
alliance.
</P>
<P>
Both Bulgaria and Turkey called for an early establishment of
the multinational force, she added.
</P>
<P>
On the Kosovo crisis, Cem said that Turkey and Bulgaria share
very close opinions and believed NATO should play a greater role
in ending the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Cem and Mikhailova also signed a protocol on cooperation
between their ministries.
</P>
<P>
"Minister Mihailova and I outlined the two countries' approach
to further upgrading the level of political cooperation," Cem said.
</P>
<P>
"Political relations should shape economic contacts," he noted,
listing energy, construction and transport as promising areas of
future bilateral business cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also discussed the prospect of a
Bulgarian business delegation visiting Turkey, the reunification
of divided families in the two countries and bilateral cooperation
in the fight against international terrorism and organized crime.

WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
failed in their second round of talks on Thursday to revive the
stalemated Middle East peace process, State Department spokesman
James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Experts from both sides, however, said they would continue their
efforts to bridge the gap between the United States and Israel on
a U.S. proposal to withdraw Israeli troops from the West Bank,
Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He described the meeting between Albright and Netanyahu as a

</P>
<P>
"We do have sufficient reason to continue serious work," he
said. "The experts will continue to meet here..."
</P>
<P>
A planned Washington summit with both Israeli and Palestinian
leaders was aborted on Monday because of Netanyahu's
resistance. Clinton ordered Albright to cancel her European trip
and stay for more talks with Netanyahu on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Once again Albright was not able to persuade the Israeli leader
during two days of talks into accepting the U.S. proposal on the
scale of withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Rubin did not mention whether there would be more talks between
Albright and Netanyahu since Albright will remain in the United

Albright is leaving for London on the weekend to attend a

<HEADLINE> Chinese Universities to Enrol Foreign Students Directly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China will select at least five
universities next month to pioneer independent enrolling of
foreign students, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Ministry of Education are quoted as saying
that foreigners interested in studying in China may apply for
admission directly to these universities to circumvent government
meddling.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of the reform of China's education system
concerning registration of foreign students.
</P>
<P>
The selected universities -- they are still being chosen --
will be free to decide on enrollment, campus management, graduation
and the awarding of academic degrees, said Cao Guoxing, deputy
director of the foreign affairs department of the Ministry of
Education.
</P>
<P>
The practice will gradually extend to other universities, Cao
revealed.
</P>
<P>
At present, 197 colleges and universities in China are
authorized to recruit foreigners. Eighty-two accept students with
Chinese government scholarships. They provide a wide range of
courses from music to medicine, from economics to engineering and
from law to geology.
</P>
<P>
Cao said these schools should update curricula according to
foreign students' demands, in addition to letting them know of
China's culture, history, and reform, opening-up policies and
achievements.
</P>
<P>
Other reforms will cover examination and enrollment criteria,
campus logistics and the awarding of academic degrees.
</P>
<P>
Ministry figures show that China has received 258,000 foreign
students since 1978, when the country began to recruit them on a
large scale.
</P>
<P>
Last year along, there were almost 45,000 students from 160
countries and regions, up 6 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
Cao noted that most students are from China's Asian neighbors,
followed by Europe, America, Africa and Oceania, with 90 percent
of them studying at their own expense, and other 10 percent
enjoying Chinese government scholarships.
</P>
<P>
More and more students are coming not just for such traditional
courses as language and culture, but for modern subjects like law
and finance as well, Cao said. Masters' and doctors' degrees are
replacing lower degrees as the targets of foreign students.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Urged to Invest in Chinese Textile Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China's massive reduction of
textile spindles has offered foreign investors opportunities for a
quick start in the Chinese market, said Cheng Haibo, mayor of
Changde in Central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with representatives of foreign-funded enterprises
in Changde, Cheng said that foreigners can have their investment
costs substantially cut by taking over existing workshops, water
and electricity systems at a time the textile industry is
shrinking its scale.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said he believes now is the best time to invest in his
city and the rest of the country because the prices of steel,
cement and other raw materials have plunged to the bottom in the
1990s with China strengthening investment in infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The mayor urged foreign investors to lose no time in learning
and exploiting new policies and regulations made by the new
generation in the central government.
</P>
<P>
He reminded the representatives that the nearby Three Gorges
hydro-power project will also promote the city's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that Changde's main livelihood is grain and
cotton production but that the processing industry in this sector
is less developed.
</P>
<P>
Believing lucrative business deals lie in the agricultural
processing industry, he urged foreign investors to spend more time
in researching investment opportunities in the city's agricultural
sector and that of the whole country.
</P>
<P>
Cheng's suggestions received warm acclaim by representatives of
20 major joint ventures in Changde.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are more than 240 foreign-funded enterprises in
Changde.

<HEADLINE> Shanxi Develops Water-Efficient Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A new water-efficient technique is
now widely used by farmers in Shanxi Province, an arid area in
north China.
</P>
<P>
Farmers bury a thin plastic pipeline 30-40 centimeters below
ground level. One end of the pipeline is linked with a water tank
in the field. A hole with a diameter of one centimeter is cut at a
distance of certain yards on the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
In this way, water mixed with fertilizer is carried to the root
of each plant through holes in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The technique has cut the amount of water for irrigating one
hectare of land from 1,050 cubic meters to 225 cubic meters and
reduced the loss of fertilizer by half, while the output of per
hectare yield of grain and fruit increased by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition to seepage irrigation, other imported techniques
such as sprinkling and drip irrigation have spread to all parts of
Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the farmland irrigated with
water-efficient techniques expanded at an annual rate of 66,600
hectares. By the end of 1997, the area of said fields in Shanxi
rose to 533,300 hectares, accounting for 40 percent of paddy
fields.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay's Foreign Currency Reserves Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Deposits in the U.S. dollar in
Uruguay's banks registered a 70 million dollar increase in March
over the previous month, the Central Bank of Uruguay (BCU) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in foreign currency reserves in the first quarter
of this year added up to 290 million dollars in the Latin American
country.
</P>
<P>
The increase has brought the nation's foreign currency reserves
up to almost 8 billion dollars, according to the BCU.
</P>
<P>
The figure equals to 82 percent of the assets of the country's
financial institutions or 40 percent of its gross domestic product
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The BCU explained that the growth of the deposits in dollars
shows that investors seek the security of their capital in moments
when the volatility of the stock markets still exists in the wake
of the Asian financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Province to Auction Wasteland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Shaanxi Province in northwest China
will auction its remaining 2.73 million hectares of wasteland in
three years in a bid to improve the eco-system and agricultural
production conditions.
</P>
<P>
The province began the practice in 1992 when Lijiacha Township
of Zichang County auctioned wasteland. By now, it has sold the
wasteland-use rights to 1.13 million hectares in the forms of
auctions, leasing, and stock cooperation. Some 413,000 hectares
have been developed and improved.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi set the land-use term at 50 years, defining that
developers enjoy independent management rights and that the rights
can be inherited, made over, mortgaged, or used as cooperative
stakes.
</P>
<P>
Sector insiders estimate that all the wasteland, if well and
scientifically cultivated, would increase 45 billion yuan in
output value annually, and bring in 31.5 billion yuan in
profits.

RIO DE JANEIRO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Brazil reduced tariffs and
extened the term of financing to facilitate the imports of rice,
as it braces up for a possible shortage of the grain.
</P>
<P>
Rice harvest in Brazil decreased as the result of the El Nino
climate, so Brazil needs to import some two million tons of rice
this year to meet domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian government reduced the tariffs on rice imports by
between 15 and 21 percent, and said that before August 31, there
will be no limit to the term of financing, which now is 30 days.

according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The total amount included 7.8 billion yuan (940 million US
dollars) in basic construction, down 18.1 percent. Investment in
technical renovation dropped 27.6 percent compared with the
corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Shanghai's investment in real estate was up 6.9
percent year-on-year to 6.75 billion yuan (813 million US dollars)
in the first three months. Investment in the industrial sector
also edged up 2.3 percent to 6.22 billion yuan (749.4 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the quarterly decrease in investment in
basic construction mainly to the fact that construction on the
third phase of the giant Baoshan Iron and Steel Corp. has passed
its peak.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some large projects in the Pudong New Area are
still in the preparation period, the analysts added.
</P>
<P>
While describing the quarterly investment decline as "normal,"
the analysis called for greater efforts to accelerate the
construction of ongoing projects and to raise more funds for
fixed-asset investment.

<HEADLINE> German Greens Party Revises Controversial Election Platform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Germany's Greens party
Thursday decided to drop a series of unpopular demands from their
election platform in a bid to reverse a steep drop in their public
support.
</P>
<P>
With only four months to go before the general elections in
September this year, the Greens leadership agreed Thursday not to
stick to their demand for a tripling of the country's gasoline
prices in a ten-year period.
</P>
<P>
They also backed down on a earlier call for the abolition of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The Greens has hoped to form an alliance with the main
opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) to replace German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right ruling coalition after the
national elections on September 27 this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the radical demands made by the Greens at a party
congress two months have triggered widespread protests and
prompted the SPD chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder to say
that the radical wing of the Greens "cannot expect to play a role
in a government of mine".
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German ZDF newspaper on Thursday,
Schroeder described the latest move made by the Greens as "a step
in the right direction".
</P>
<P>
The decisions, however, have still to be approved by another
party congress in June.

JAKARTA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
returned to Jakarta at about 4:00 a.m. Friday, one day before
schedule after attending the G-15 summit meeting in Cairo and a
one-day visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The president cut short his planned three-day visit to Egypt to
one day due to domestic unrest.
</P>
<P>
In the last two days, dozens of people were wounded and
hundreds of shops and buildings looted or burned by rioters in the
capital city of Indonesia, TV Indonesia reported.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, House Speaker Harmoko said that the House leaders
will meet with President Soeharto soon upon his return here from
Cairo to discuss the president's statement to resign if he is no
longer trusted by the people.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said in Cairo that he is ready to step aside if he has
lost the trust of his people and pledged not to retain his power
through force.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Evacuate U.S. Citizens from Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department on
Thursday decided to evacuate non-essential U.S. embassy staff
from Indonesia as the situation there is deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
A military delegation also postponed its visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
"In light of the deteriorating situation, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright met with Undersecretary Thomas
Pickering this morning and has approved an ordered departure for
non-essential personnel from Indonesia," spokesman James Rubin
announced.
</P>
<P>
The evacuation of non-essential personnel goes one step
beyond Wednesday's decision to pull out the families of embassy
and other U.S. government staff.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said there is a cycle of violence that is escalating in
Indonesia. "It would not be responsible to delay such a request
or to otherwise request non-essential personnel to be placing
themselves at risk," he added.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters that there were
no immediate plans to use U.S. military aircraft for the
evacuation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a planned visit by a military delegation to
Indonesia was put off because of the deteriorating situation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation was to have been headed by Adm. Joseph
Prueher, commander of the Hawaii-based U.S. forces in the
Pacific. He was to have carried a message urging "restraint" by
Indonesian security forces dealing with demonstrations.

<HEADLINE> Justice Department Helps Defray Criminal Alien </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Justice Department awarded
492 million dollars to state and local governments to help pay for
incarcerating illegal immigrants who have committed crimes in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
California, which puts its spending at nearly half a billion
dollars annually to keep criminal aliens behind bars, will get the
biggest share -- 223 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
New York, whose criminal alien incarceration costs are
estimated at 180 million dollars, was awarded 94 million dollars,
while Texas got 39 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"In the past three years, the Justice Department has awarded
over 1.1 billion dollars to states and localities to pay for
housing criminal aliens," Attorney General Janet Reno said
Thursday. "We have also made substantial progress in helping state
and local jurisdictions reduce the number of illegal aliens housed
in these facilities by expediting deportation hearings and
removals."
</P>
<P>
The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) announced that
its criminal removals are up 12 percent for the first six months
of the fiscal year. "This increase is a reflection of our focus on
removing aliens who commit serious crimes in our communities,"
said INS general counsel Paul Virtue.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 Congress decided to help defray some of the
incarceration costs.
</P>
<P>
States and localities with correctional facilities can apply
for the federal funds, which are granted based on the number of
criminal aliens housed and the cost of incarceration. In addition
to the 49 states, 200 localities also are receiving the grants.
</P>
<P>
Other top beneficiaries include Florida, Arizona, New Jersey,
Massachusetts, and Illinois. New York City and Los Angeles County
are the top recipients among localities.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Salary Increases to Stay at 4 Percent: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The New York-based Conference
Board reported Thursday that the salary increases in the United
States will average 4 percent in 1998 and will remain at this
level through 1999.
</P>
<P>
The economic research group said that low inflation and a
selective use of compensation dollars are enabling U.S. companies
to keep a lid on salary costs. But most salaried employees will
see real earnings gains because of modest inflation levels.
</P>
<P>
"Companies are avoiding the fixed costs of salary increases by
using cash and stock incentives to retain and reward key
employees," said Charles Peck, an economist of the Conference
Board.
</P>
<P>
Continuing low inflation will help firms keep salary costs
under control through next year, the board said. The Conference
Board's latest forecast projects inflation to increase by only 1.7
percent in 1998. If this happens, employees on average will
experience a real earnings gain of 2.3 percent this year, the
largest since 1986.
</P>
<P>
But if inflation advances to 3 percent next year, as predicted
by the Board, real salary gains will narrow to just 1 percent in
1999, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report was based on a survey which covers 640 companies
in six major industries.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
on Thursday started their second talks after they failed to reach
agreement on Wednesday over the scale of pullback by Israeli
troops on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Albright said before starting talks that she was looking
forward to the meetings with Netanyahu, while the Israeli leader
said they would work "on hope."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has tried to persuade Israel into
accepting U.S. proposals on 13 percent withdrawal by Israeli
troops from the West Bank. But Netanyahu rejected the proposals,
arguing that would endanger Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
The State Department said on Thursday that new violence on the
West Bank ad Gaza underscores deteriorating relations between
Israelis and Palestinians and urgency of putting the peace process
back on track.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly this outbreak reflects a deterioration in relations
between Israelis and Palestinians and underscores for all to see
the need to break the impasse in peace process," spokesman James
Rubin told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for Combined Fight Against Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Copyright Protection Society
(ZAMCOPS) Thursday called for combined efforts in the fight
against rampant piracy on musical works in the country.
</P>
<P>
ZAMCOPS Chairman Emmanuel Chanda said at a signing ceremony with
Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) that there is need to
promote and protect the local music industry by ensuring that
copyright law is obeyed.
</P>
<P>
He said ignorance among many stakeholders is the biggest hindrance
to the fight against piracy in the country and is frustrating his
society's efforts to successfully fight the scourge.
</P>
<P>
Chanda urged ZNBC to promote efforts of local musicians by
allocating more air time to local music so that musicians can raise
enough money from royalties which are currently being enjoyed more by
foreign musicians.
</P>
<P>
He hailed ZNBC management for their commitment to the promotion of
music in the country as evidenced by the signing the copyright
agreement Thursday, under which ZNBC will pay music copyright royalties
as well as ensure accountability and quality in the music industry.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, ZNBC Director-General Duncan Mbazima urged
local musicians to produce high quality music to compete favorable
with rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
He defended the newly introduced music channel on television,
saying the move is aimed at promoting african including Zambian music
and not to corrupt morals.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia cannot be lagged behind, but should be in step
with the developments taking place in other part of the world.

<P>
NEW YORK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks retreated slightly
Thursday, as a profit warning by Hewlett-Packard pulled the Dow Jones
industrial average down from Wednesday's record high, but other
technology shares held steady ground.
</P>
<P>
The Dow fell 39.61 points to 9,172.23 after recovering from an
opening plunge of nearly 100 points and briefly flirting with a
new high.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indicators closed lower after surrendering some
marginal gains.
</P>
<P>
Decliners outpaced advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with its volume totaling 575.24 million shares as
against 599.28 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 1.49 to 1,117.37, and the Nasdaq
composite index fell 0.78 to 1,865.40.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 0.89 to 578.31, the American
Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.60 to 741.39, and the
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.93 to 475.55.
</P>
<P>
HP tumbled 14 percent following late Wednesday's warning that
the computer and printer maker's profits have been hurt by price
wars and the market weakness in Asia.
</P>
<P>
However, IBM rallied following Wednesday afternoon's upbeat
presentation by CEO Louis Gerstner.
</P>
<P>
The technology sector also got support from a ceasefire in the
antitrust battle against Microsoft. The Justice Department and 20
states agreed to delay their planned antitrust suits against
Microsoft, which agreed first to delay the initial shipments of
Windows 98 until Monday so that negotiations can continue.
</P>
<P>
There was not much reaction to a report showing that consumer
prices rose 0.2 percent in April. The increase, though modest, was
the largest in six months.
</P>
<P>
Separately, in another sign that inflationary pressures persist
in the job market, the Labor Department also reported that new

<HEADLINE> Third Party Proposed Over Ethio-Eritrean Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Eritrean government
proposed Thursday a third party over the land dispute between
Eritrea and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the five-point proposals made by the Eritrean
government after its meeting Thursday considering a statement
issued Wednesday by the Ethiopian government.
</P>
<P>
A statement announced at a press conference in Asmara Thursday
evening after an Ethiopian cabinet ministers meeting said: "There
have been and continue to exist border disputes in certain
localities along the common borders between Eritrea and
Ethiopia."
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "A joint committee had been formed from
both governments to resolve these problems and to delineate on
the ground the boundary line".
</P>
<P>
It also proposed that "areas under 'dispute' shall be
demilitarized temporarily and be free from the presence of armies
of both countries. The enforcement of this understanding shall be
guaranteed by the third party."
</P>
<P>
"If the above proposal for resolving the dispute through the
involvement of a third party and without further complications is
not acceptable, the matter to be referred to international
adjudication," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ethiopian News Agency Thursday quoted a
spokesman from the Ministry of Information and Culture as saying
that Eritrean forces are still occupying Badmen Qoreda and parts
of Aheraro in defiance to Ethiopia's demand for unconditional
withdrawal from the area.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian government issued a statement Wednesday demanding
Eritrea to pull out its forces from occupied areas in
north-western part of the country.

WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration will
soon decide whether to impose sanctions on firms from France,
Russia and Malaysia for investing in Iran's energy sector, a
senior official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee hearing,
Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk said the issue was
"under active consideration" and "a decision is imminent."
</P>

Indyk said members of Congress would be briefed in the next few
days on the matter by Stuart Eisenstat, undersecretary for
economic, business and agricultural affairs.
</P>

A law enacted in 1996 to strengthen sanctions against Iran and
Libya punishes foreign companys which invest more than 20 million
U.S. dollars per year in Iran.

Since late last year, the U.S. State Department has been
