UNION MECHANICS CLAIM VINDICATION IN AMWEST FINE

<TEXT>
<P>
   From the moment America West Airlines fired 500 mechanics three
years ago, some workers in the airline's hangar have sounded dire
warnings about lax maintenance. America West management repeatedly
dismissed the concerns as sour grapes and union rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   In the minds of the mechanics, the Federal Aviation
Administration validated their worries Tuesday by levying a $5
million fine against the Tempe airline for maintenance lapses,
mechanics say.
</P>
<P>
   Even if half the fine is forgiven as proposed, it will be the
largest fine paid by a U.S. airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mechanics feel a certain vindication here,'' Patrick
Lacefield, a spokesman for the Teamsters, which represents the 350
remaining mechanics, said Wednesday. ``They've been talking about
this outsourcing stuff from day one, ever since 1995. America West
has always pooh-poohed it.''
</P>
<P>
   America West maintains the layoffs and shift to outside
contractors is not the problem. Executives said late Tuesday that
the biggest problem the FAA found, involving inspection lapses on
numerous Airbus A320 aircraft, goes back to changes by the
manufacturer in inspection procedures instituted in 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``This predates it (the layoffs) by two years,'' Richard
Goodmanson, the carrier's chief executive officer, said late
Tuesday after the fine was announced.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA didn't single out the layoffs and outsourcing in its
announcement, but its settlement agreement with America West calls
for the airline to set up a team to oversee its outside maintenance
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hefty fine, Wall Street and most travelers were
nonplussed. The Tempe airline's stock fell Wednesday just 56 cents,
to $29.69 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading volume
was normal.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts focused on the company's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are retaining our buy rating, as the bulk of this
headline-making issue appears to be behind the company, and its
near-term earnings momentum remains among the best in the airline
group,'' analyst James Higgins of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
wrote in a brief report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said the only continuing issue at the airline appears to
be labor negotiations, which prompted the FAA, in a separate move,
to increase its scrutiny of the airline last month. The FAA said it
has received anonymous complaints about safety and maintenance from
flight attendants and mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   One industry analyst went so far as to blast the size of the
fine and the FAA's national media blitz announcing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more of a fine than they laid on the ValuJet incident
where 110 people died,'' said Mike Boyd of the Boyd Group in
Evergreen, Colo., referring to the 1996 crash in the Florida
Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd said $5 million _ even though it'll be cut in half if
America West complies with the settlement agreement _ is a hefty
penalty for what he calls regulatory, not safety violations. He
added that some of the issues raised were important but were not
``life-threatening failures'' and probably occur at one time or
another at all the major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safety is an important issue, I don't discount that. And
missing inspections is something that's important,'' he said. ``But
this isn't a case where an airline, like ValuJet, blatantly ignored
safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd, who has never consulted for America West, said the FAA,
which was criticized after the ValuJet crash, is using America West
to make a statement that it's tough on safety. The carrier is a
good target because it's relatively small and lacks the political
clout of industry biggies such as American and United, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a political photo opportunity,'' he said, noting that FAA
Administrator Jane Garvey was featured in the announcement about
the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA dismissed Boyd's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The action was initiated by career FAA employees and was
carried on in its entirety by career FAA employees,'' spokesman
Mitch Barker said. ``There was nothing political about the
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite safety assurances by America West, some passengers
remain skittish and refused to fly the carrier.
</P>
<P>
   One traveler said she was so upset by the FAA fine that she
called America West, demanding a refund on a flight her husband is
taking next week to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went round and round and round,'' said Patty Snyder, who
lives in Waddell, northwest of Phoenix. ``That's just crazy that
when you can't even find a customer service person to complain
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder eventually got through to a manager, who told her that
every other call was from a passenger who wanted a refund.
</P>
<P>
   America West spokeswoman Patty Nowack said there's no such
panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had very, very few people request that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nowack said the airline's regular refund policy stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a customer has purchased a non-refundable ticket, they have
a non-refundable ticket,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one travel agency heard from concerned clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had regular, loyal flyers wanting to switch and fly on
another carrier,'' said Ella Caine, owner of Ella Caine Travel in
Scottsdale. ``I had one corporate account that called today and
said, `No, put us on another airline. We won't fly America West.'
''
</P>
<P>
   But other agencies said they hadn't heard from any passengers
booked on America West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't gotten one phone call,'' said Dawn Poturalski, an
agent with A World of Travel in Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto at Bon Voyage Travel in downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Van Epps, a partner in Moon Valley Travel, said there were
no questions from travelers about the FAA's action on Wednesday,
but they have cropped up since reports of the airline's FAA
troubles surfaced a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been kind of an ongoing thing with them since this whole
thing started,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers aren't so much concerned with whether the airline is
safe as much as persistent flight delays and cancellations, Van
Epps said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been shifting equipment (planes) around,'' he said,
adding that a client's flight from Mexico City to Phoenix scheduled
for next week was canceled because the plane was needed on another
route.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters' Lacefield said he can't believe how America West
is spinning the huge fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe the America West press release, it seems like
they've been given a $5 million fine for good behavior,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wake-up call.''  &QL;

HEAD OF RACING TEAM QUESTIONED IN DRUG CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHOLET, France _ The management of the Festina bicycle racing
team, under increasing pressure in a doping controversy in the Tour
de France, announced Wednesday that the head of the team was being
questioned by French police.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno Roussel, coach of the nine Festina riders in the race, was
in police custody here, though not charged with anything.
</P>
<P>
   Roussel has been asking for an inquiry since the race came to
France earlier this week so that he could address the reports of
drug use by his riders.
</P>
<P>
   According to Agence France-Presse, the team's doctor, Eric
Rickaert, was also in custody.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Miguel Rodriguez, who owns Festina, a Spanish
watch manufacturer, said that if an intention to use illegal drugs
was proved, he would end his contract to sponsor the team, which
runs through 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The affair began last Wednesday, when a masseur for the team,
which is based in France, was arrested at the French-Belgian border
in an official Tour de France car bearing the Festina emblem. A
search of the car revealed a large quantity of amphetamines,
steroids, masking drugs and EPO, a chemical that thickens the blood
and thus carries more oxygen to muscles. All these substances are
banned in the sport but believed to be used by some riders.
</P>
<P>
   The jailed masseur, Willy Voet, a Belgian, reportedly insisted
at first that all the drugs were for his personal use but then said
he was taking them to Dublin, where the race began last Saturday,
under orders from Festina team officials.
</P>
<P>
   Both Roussel and Ryckaert have denied this and Roussel announced
Tuesday night that he had instructed his lawyer to act against
publication of what he called rumors, which would violate his
rights under French law.
</P>
<P>
   Tour officials have noted that Voet's arrest was made far from
the race and before it began. When the affair became public late
last Friday, Jean-Marie Leblanc, the race's director, ruled out any
penalties until more facts became known.
</P>
<P>
   He repeated that position Wednesday in a television appearance,
saying that for now there was no question of ejecting the nine-man
team, which includes Laurent Brochard, the world road race
champion, and two favorites in the Tour, Richard Virenque and Alex
Zulle.
</P>
<P>
   But Roger Legeay, the coach of the Gan team in the Tour de
France and the head of the French league of professional cycling,
said on the same television program: ``The Tour is supposed to be a
festival. We can't have a festival with this hanging over us. This
must be resolved quickly.''

BRITISH OPEN NOTEBOOK: DALY BATTLES, LOVE'S BACK 
</HEADLINE>

 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ John Daly was his usual forthcoming self
Wednesday, revealing that he had reunited with his wife, Paulette,
who had filed for divorce last year.``I'm back with my wife, which
was really a miracle in itself,'' said Daly, who won the 1995
British Open. ``We got back together about two months ago. So
things actually in my life are really good now.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly also talked about the daily challenge he faces as a
recovering alcoholic. He laughed when asked if he was having
trouble finding meetings for recovering alcoholics in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's drunks all over this world, man, we're everywhere,''
he said. ``I've been doing real well for the last year and three
months. My body has changed an awful lot. Physically, I'm
overweight and out of shape. You go from one addiction to another,
and mine seems to be food. Hopefully that will change in a few
years of sobriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have cravings for the sugar. For people who don't
know, if you're an alcoholic like I am, you crave sugar when you
quit drinking because alcohol turns to sugar in your body. Europe
has the greatest chocolate in the world. I don't know which is
going to be my pick on the golf course. I have not found it yet,
but I'm sure I will. It's too cold to eat ice cream.''
</P>
<P>
   Love's Back Problems
</P>
<P>
   Davis Love III said his back, which bothered him for several
months, was feeling as good as it has in many months. He has been
given clearance to do whatever he wants to on the golf course, and
he does not expect to have recurring problems throughout his
career, as long as he stays in shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hurt my back, but I don't have a bad back,'' said Love, who
won last year's PGA Championship. ``Fred Couples has a bad back. No
matter what he does, he's going to have problems. Me, as long as I
don't do anything crazy, don't play five or six straight weeks, and
take care of myself, I should be OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the flight over here was funny, because I'm not supposed
to sit in one place for too long, and every time I got up, it
seemed like they turned the seat belt sign on. After a while, I was
hiding in the back from the flight attendants, so they wouldn't see
me.''

RUSSELL ENJOYS VISIT TO STADIUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former manager Bill Russell made his first
appearance at Dodger Stadium since his June 21 firing, sitting in
the private box of former president Peter O'Malley with his wife
Susan and a collection of Los Angeles Dodgers dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Russell did not speak to new general manager Tom Lasorda nor any
of his former players Wednesday, but he did not appear
uncomfortable with the surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter invited my wife and I to come out and enjoy a
ballgame,'' Russell said. ``This has been a part of my life for 32
years and we decided to come out and enjoy ourselves. What better
way than to come out and see the Dodgers and the Giants?''
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the firing, new club president Bob Graziano said
there was a chance Russell could return to the organization.
Russell's relationship with Lasorda is strained and nothing has
been discussed to this point.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, who is being paid the remainder of his two-year,
$700,000 contract, will remain in the Los Angeles area this summer.
He has a place in Glendale, but will be visiting family in Oklahoma
during the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Claire, the Dodgers executive vice president who was fired
the same day as Russell, worked for ESPN as a baseball analyst
during the July 4 Braves-Mets telecast in Atlanta and could be
doing additional games this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Among the former teammates on hand Wednesday were Steve Garvey,
Steve Yeager, Ken Landreaux and, of course, Orel Hershiser, the
winning pitcher in the Giants' 5-3 victory over the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said seeing old faces was fun, although some of them
were here to see Lasorda about a position in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't hard to be here,'' Russell said. ``A lot of people
would have had a problem with it, but I've been following the team
and we just wanted to come out. It was good because the fans
greeted me and wished me good luck and success. I even signed some
autographs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutty Guthrie: Mark Guthrie, who replaced Dodgers starter Darren
Dreifort to begin the eighth inning, was struck on the left ankle
by a sharp one-hopper by Bill Mueller with one out in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Charlie Strasser came to the mound, but Guthrie remained
in the game. He had a noticeable limp as he walked off the field
but finished with two scoreless innings. Guthrie has allowed three
runs in his past 171/3 innings over 13 appearances (1.56 ERA).
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I've been throwing well,'' Guthrie said. ``I
gave up a home run in San Francisco. It really doesn't matter how
well I'm doing. We lost the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Eric Karros avoided an embarrassing situation on
Mueller's grounder to first in the seventh inning. Karros made the
stop but turned his back to the plate and took his time getting to
the bag. He beat Mueller by a half-step.

ORIOLES CRUSH RANGERS, 14-3
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Tonight will not be foreign for right-hander
Aaron Sele.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-game winner will be asked to terminate yet another losing
streak for the American League West contenders known collectively
as the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Rick Helling, attempting to join Yankees
right-hander David Cone as the major leagues' only 13-game winner,
suffered his worst performance this season in the Orioles' 14-3
victory last night at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers lost their fourth consecutive game, and Helling
played a significant role because of his inability to pitch down in
the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every pitch was up here,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said
as he motioned above the letters on his jersey. ``He's always been
able to make that adjustment. That's the reason he's 12-5. He's
always been able to make that adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night was a rare exception.
</P>
<P>
   Helling could not complete the fifth inning before the
fifth-largest gathering for a regular-season game at The Ballpark.
Helling surrendered eight runs on seven hits and matched a
single-game high with five walks in a 41/3-inning appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was more mechanical than anything else,'' Helling
said. ``I was rushing a bit and getting behind in the count. When
you walk guys in the big leagues, you're going to pay for it more
often than not.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven consecutive batters reached safely, including three via
walks, in the Orioles' five-run second inning. Orioles catcher
Lenny Webster and second baseman Roberto Alomar produced most of
the damage with two-run base hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to make any excuses, but I lost my rhythm during
that second inning,'' Helling said. ``I put our team in a hole, and
I'm very disappointed in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, who won their seventh consecutive game, continued
their assault against right-hander Tim Crabtree and left-hander
Scott Bailes. The Orioles collected a single-game, season-high 19
hits and matched their single-game best for runs.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Sele (12-5) in a familiar position.
</P>
<P>
   He does not lack experience.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the third time since June 23 that Sele will step on
the mound with the Rangers amid a losing streak of three or more
games.
</P>
<P>
   Sele met the challenge on both those occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander allowed four runs (three earned) in a
seven-inning appearance in the Rangers' 16-5 victory June 23
against the Arizona Diamondbacks, and pitched six scoreless innings
in a 9-2 victory July 4 against Seattle. That translates into a 2-0
record with a 2.08 earned-run average.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows what kind of pitcher Aaron is,'' Helling said. ``I
wish I could have been the guy tonight to stop this losing
streak.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Sele's turn now, and he should recognize the way.
</P>
<P>
   No map required.

WORLD BANK SUSPENDS 3 EMPLOYEES FOR SUSPECTED KICKBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The World Bank, which lends billions of dollars a
year for development projects in poor countries, is investigating
possible kickbacks and other wrongdoing by at least three bank
employees, bank officials said on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The three employees have been notified that they are under
suspicion and have been suspended, said Klas Bergman, the World
Bank's chief of media relations. Bergman said the three are
midlevel employees at the bank's headquarters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Malloch Brown, the bank's vice president for external
affairs, said on Wednesday night that more bank aides could come
under investigation, but he could not speculate how many.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to confirm the allegations or disprove them,'' Malloch
Brown said, adding that the bank's ``moral authority'' was at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of the investigation involves a water utility project
in Algiers. The bank is suing a former bank employee in federal
court to recover thousands of dollars that it believes he took in
kickbacks from a contractor who was a former neighbor and who did
not complete the work properly, the bank officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the investigation involves possible misuse of
a trust fund set up by the Japanese government to subsidize bank
administrative expenses, according to The Washington Post, which
first reported on the investigation in Thursday's editions. Bergman
said he could not comment on that part of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bank funnels as much as $25 billion a year into
development projects abroad _ and tries to guard against corruption
in the needy countries that get its loans _ the World Bank's
integrity is all-important, Malloch Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the amount of money involved in the investigation might
be in the tens of thousands of dollars, or what he called ``pretty
small beer'' compared to the bank's moral stature.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman said the bank set up a special unit, the Oversight
Committee on Fraud and Corruption, this spring after top officials
began to get word of possible wrongdoing. The bank has also hired
the global accounting firm Price Waterhouse Coopers and two outside
fraud specialists.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank president, James Wolfensohn, distributed a
message to bank staff members on Wednesday in which he underlined
the seriousness of the accusations, regardless of the amount of
money involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bank has a passionate commitment to fight corruption,''
Wolfensohn said, calling it a ``cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While I have no reason to believe there is a widespread
problem in the bank, even one case is one too many,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has about 8,600 employees and has its headquarters a
short distance from the White House, which Bergman said is being
kept abreast of the investigation through the Treasury Department.

if proven, would constitute the worst wrongdoing in the bank's
history.

$500,000.

   SAFRICA-FARM-ATTACKS (Mooinooi, South Africa) _ The farmers
around here, like many elsewhere in the country, are numbering
their farms on color-coded maps and setting up command posts in
their basements where automatic weapons, helmets, gas masks and
bulletproof vests are at the ready. Attacks on white farmers have
been mounting, and some assaults have been particularly brutal. The
farmers may well be feeling the brunt of a crime wave that has
swept across the country, leaving many South Africans living behind
high fences and barred windows. But many farmers believe the
attacks are more calculated _ the work of black militants aiming at
a group that remains among the most right-wing in the country. By
Suzanne Daley.

   GENITAL-MUTILATION (United Nations) _ For the Sabiny people of
eastern Uganda, 1998 is a circumcision year _ as are all even years
_ when girls as well as boys would normally be expected to endure a
painful rite of passage to young adulthood. But not this time, said
G.W. Cheborian, chairman of the Sabiny Elders Association, a
council of clan leaders. While young men of 14 to about 22 will
still take part in elaborate circumcision ceremonies in December to
mark their entry into manhood, for many if not most girls and young
women, there will be no genital cutting. By Barbara Crossette.

Angiostatin, which blocks formation of blood vessels that feed
tumors, is far more effective in combination with radiation

to a ``clinically feasible'' treatment strategy that could be
particularly useful in brain, head and neck cancers. By Nicholas

   IOWA-BOOM (Dubuque, Iowa) _ From the porch views of the
Victorian-era houses sitting high on the limestone bluffs over the
Mississippi River, it looked like a sad parade on the streets of
Dubuque in the '80s, an exodus of downhearted Iowans fleeing the
farm-crisis economy. In those days, with unemployment rates over 14
percent, young Iowans with roots five or six generations deep came
to see their future prospects here as hopeless. These days,
Dubuque, a city of some 60,000 people, has a new and enviable
problem: too many good jobs and not enough workers. So Dubuque
civic and business officials have begun an aggressive program to
bring back its sons, daughters and grandchildren. By Dirk Johnson.

DODGERS NEED A LEADER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It took half a season but the Los Angeles Dodgers
finally have wandered into the pennant race, albeit with all the
nonchalance of the thousands of fans who found their Dodger Stadium
seats well after the opening pitch in Wednesday's twilight game
between the host team and the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, bless their souls, had been like guides in the
wilderness, marking the Dodgers' path by dropping five games in a
row. It took an ex-Dodger, of all people, to remind the Giants this
was the enemy they were helping, which Orel Hershiser did in time
to avoid a series sweep via a 5-3 win in the three-game series
finale in front of a crowd of 34,596.
</P>
<P>
   The loss, only the Dodgers' third in seven games since the
All-Star break, left L.A. 5{ behind the Giants in the wild-card
race with 68 games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Having come this far, the question is where do the Dodgers go
from here, besides to St. Louis for a four-game set against a
Cardinals team that is seven games under .500 and staring vacantly
at the Dodgers' backs?
</P>
<P>
   It says here the Dodgers have plenty of trail left to straighten
out this wayward season, but only if they go out and get someone
fiery to lead them _ by the ear or the scruff of the neck, if
necessary _ the rest of the way. Someone with a wicked fastball and
an even nastier disposition. Someone by the name of Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   So what if the Seattle southpaw recently got into a scuffle with
a teammate, David Segui, over something seemingly as silly as the
volume of the clubhouse stereo? The Dodgers need somebody to
brazenly step forward and turn up the passion in the Dodgers' room
until the walls are throbbing with intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Raul Mondesi is the leader in the clubhouse by
da' vault, having signed the richest contract in team history over
the winter. To his credit, the Dominican Republic native has taken
great pains to be more vocal, jumping on the chance to speak
English the way he used to the first offerings of opposing
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, warming to his No.3 spot in the order, batted .560 (14
for 25) in six games against the Giants this month. He was 3 for 4
with two RBI Wednesday to improve his batting average to .385 for
the month and .293 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to think we can win 10 games in a row,'' Mondesi
said before the game, trying to set the proper tone.
</P>
<P>
   But attitudes are instilled by actions and not just words.
Mondesi muddled his message last month when he was pulled over for
drunk driving in Glendale hours after a home game against Colorado
and some eight hours before he was due at the stadium for a matinee
against the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Partying has its place and it's decidedly not in the middle of a
race toward respectability. As soon as the Dodgers, to a man,
realize there's a bigger high out there than the one provided by
alcohol or the mere donning of a major-league uniform, then the
team will have the right mindset to put the fear of Abner Doubleday
into the likes of division-leading San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Dodgers claimed a postseason victory, in 1988,
they kept winning until there were no more games left. The unerring
compass of that year's world championship team was an
obstinate-minded professor of a pitcher named Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
   In Hershiser's eyes then and now, the only thing worse than
swearing in the clubhouse is not caring so completely you die a
little with every loss. Hershiser was working with three days' rest
between starts and a strained shoulder, but the man otherwise known
as ``Bulldog'' scratched and clawed and stubbornly hung in for the
win in his first appearance at Dodger Stadium as a Giant.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Hershiser's 81 pitches found Dodger flesh but neither of
the walked wounded, Adrian Beltre in the fourth inning nor Wilton
Guerrero in the fifth, could parlay the free base into the score
that would have broken a 3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   However, when starter Darren Dreifort hit Darryl Hamilton with a
pitch in the seventh, the Dodgers would end up feeling the hurt as
Hamilton went on to score on a wild pitch to give the Giants their
insurance run.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort has pitched well recently, yielding 22 earned runs over
the past 53 innings. But for all the enthusiasm that can be drummed
up for Dreifort, Ismael Valdes, Chan Ho Park, Dave Mlicki and Brian
Bohanon, there can be no silencing this one simple truth: Bohanon
is the only lefty among them.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Bohanon and Johnson would at least switch up
opposing batters a couple times every five days. And that's just
for starters.
</P>
<P>
   For all the changes the Dodgers have made, something still is
missing. It's a mean streak. A Bulldog.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hershiser, ``There's definitely something going on here
where they're trying to change the chemistry between the team and
the city (and) the chemistry within the team (and) the chemistry in
the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   If they're serious about winning, it says here they're not
through yet.

REFORM COMES SLOWLY TO BOXING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Last of a three-part series) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dean Bonham, a Denver-based sports marketing
executive, has an image of what boxing in this country should look
like.
</P>
<P>
   It has a central governing body, like the NBA or NFL, that
regulates every aspect of the sport _ from matchmaking to rankings,
business practices to safety. It has long-term promotional
campaigns in place.
</P>
<P>
   And it has integrity.
</P>
<P>
   In this boxing world, with only eight champions in each of the
weight divisions, fighters must face their most compelling
challengers or risk sanctions. Finally, the public will see the
fights it most wants to see.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is fantasy. For the past century, boxing could
be likened to a lawless town in the Wild West, where anarchy rules
and only the most cunning _ or most devious _ survive.
</P>
<P>
   Many agree that those in control had better take a close look at
the idealistic model. Clearly, boxing must make changes if it hopes
to thrive into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to adapt to a changing marketplace on a regular basis
or lose our competitive edge. It's as simple as that,'' said Mark
Taffet, senior vice president of TVKO, HBO's pay-per-view arm. &QL; 
MAKING CHANGES
</P>
<P>
   Forces are at work to clean up boxing. Two of the most
vociferous are U.S. senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Richard
Bryan (D-Nev.).
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, they co-authored a law to improve safety
standards for boxers. Now, they've introduced legislation that
would protect boxers from being exploited by promoters and enhance
the integrity of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 11 provisions of ``The Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform
Act'':
</P>
<P>
   _All sanctioning bodies (organizations that rank fighters) that
do business in the United States ``must establish objective and
consistent criteria'' and accept no payoffs when they compile their
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   _All contracts between promoters and boxers will be strictly
regulated with the boxers' interest in mind.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``option'' contracts _ binding a boxer to a
promoter as a condition of getting a particular bout _ would be
limited to one year. The objective is to prevent a promoter from
controlling a weight division by coercing options from all
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   _Sanctioning bodies and promoters must submit to state boxing
commissions all contracts and fees before each event.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bryan admit this legislation, as well as their
safety-oriented law, won't change boxing. However, they and many
inside boxing agree that such steps are vital for the health of the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it,'' said The Ring editor Nigel Collins, referring to
the proposed act. ``There's a lot of good stuff in there, it's well
thought out. If it passes, it will be a huge step toward getting
rid of the bandits and parasites in the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Those in the sport also are making changes.
</P>
<P>
   Bonham's vision of a central boxing authority probably won't be
realized anytime soon. However, the newly formed Association of
Boxing Commissions could be the embryo of such an entity.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, boxing is regulated by individual state commissions,
some well organized (like California), some not. The purpose of the
ABC is to provide national standards under which the sport would
operate.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, its authority could be expanded to deal with the
proliferation of sanctioning bodies, which has rendered
``championships'' all but meaningless and contributes to the
inability to make the best fights.
</P>
<P>
   One day, some believe, the ABC, under the eye of federal
regulators, could actually rank fighters and establish one champion
in each weight class, ridding the sport of sanctioning bodies
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, its small inroads provide hope for a better
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a (government-sponsored) federal boxing
commission, per se, would work,'' said Marc Ratner, the director of
the Nevada State Athletic Commission. ``I just think it would be
too political...
</P>
<P>
   ``(The ABC) already has elevated itself. Now, we have one set of
rules for the nation on championship fights. I never thought we
could do that. And we're working on a standard set of medical
requirements....
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing a lot of things better but there's a lot to be
done.'' &QL; 
CULTIVATING FANS
</P>
<P>
   Boxing's traditional fans _ largely Latino _ are fiercely loyal.
Consistently solid pay-per-view buy rates for compelling fights are
proof of that.
</P>
<P>
   In an increasingly competitive sports market, boxing must reach
new fans _ in particular, young fans.
</P>
<P>
   HBO has taken steps in that direction. Its Boxing After Dark
series on Saturday nights is geared to a young audience and the
network says its ratings are good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major League Baseball, the NFL, the NBA, they're always
re-evaluating their marketing, their ability to meet the needs of
their audience on a regular basis,'' said Taffet, the HBO
executive. ``They try to create a new market every day, hold on
that one and then create another new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The onus is on boxing to do the same thing, to take a more
sophisticated approach to sustain and grow the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Bingo!, says Bonham, president and CEO of The Bonham Group
marketing firm.
</P>
<P>
   Under the auspices of his fictional central authority, the
sport, with one voice, would devise a marketing strategy that would
counteract the sport's negative image.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, fighters such as Naseem Hamed, whose
self-promotion is positively Ali-like, would be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   And all this must be done in the context of a reformed industry,
one whose back-alley ways _ not just its image _ have changed. The
public, Bonham insisted, isn't as ignorant as it might seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The core boxing fans are always going to be there,'' Bonham
said. ``The question I have is this: How much bigger and better can
it be? How many of those who are so turned off by boxing that they
would never buy a pay-per-view fight could be convinced to watch a
fight, to attend a fight or an autograph signing?
</P>
<P>
   ``How much more integrated can boxing _ if it's truly a clean
sport, with clean promoters, clean managers _ be in our society?
These are the questions I have.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears change is happening slowly. The legislation written
by McCain and Bryan will have impact if it becomes law. The
prospect of a central authority _ whether it's the ABC or something
like it _ is encouraging. And those in the sport are beginning to
realize it must update its marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   For the foreseeable future, it's up to the Don Kings and Bob
Arums, the HBOs and Showtimes, to rethink the way they operate.
</P>
<P>
   The promoters and managers must take risks and give the public
the fights it wants to see regardless of the matchups the
sanctioning bodies demand of them.
</P>
<P>
   Television networks, whose exclusive contracts with top fighters
hinder competition, must loosen their reins. And, as obvious as it
might seem, they must learn to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is a sport that will continue to underachieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing has been around for centuries,'' said Jay Larkin, head
of Showtime Sports. ``It's always had a black eye. And just when
you think it can't stoop any lower, it does. But I think things are
changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to.''

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A federal court ruling upholding the
constitutionality of Proposition 227 prompted schools
Superintendent Ruben Zacarias to announce that bilingual classes
throughout the Los Angeles school district will be eliminated by
Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias said that since the June 2 election, when the statewide
initiative on bilingual education won overwhelming support,
administrators have been developing two or three options for
parents to choose from. He will announce that choice to the Board
of Education on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It will be tough, however, to get schools ready in time,
Zacarias said during a news conference at Los Angeles Unified
School District headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make instructional or logistical sense,'' he said.
``I frankly think it's rather disruptive to ask any school district
to, within a matter of weeks, effect the kind of dramatic change
they are asking for.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach, he added, ``will obviously have to be radically
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Even under Proposition 227, he noted, the district can offer
``support'' to students in their primary language. The planning
process has been complicated because state education officials have
failed to respond to the district's requests for solid definitions
about the types of programs allowed under 227.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not helpful that they haven't clearly defined the
parameters,'' Zacarias said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from school districts across Los Angeles County echoed
Zacarias' frustration, saying the law is vague and doesn't give
them enough time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going on vacation in August, and school starts in
September,'' said Andrea Canady, director of elementary education
for the Burbank Unified School District adjoining Los Angeles and
head of its bilingual education program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not against doing this, but it's being forced down us
without enough time to swallow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vic Pallos, spokesman for the Glendale Unified School District,
north of Los Angeles, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a tough change,'' he said. ``A lot has to
happen in the next month or two to redesign the (bilingual
education) program.''
</P>
<P>
   Bilingual supporters said they are considering an appeal of the
decision by U.S. District Judge Charles Legge. He ruled that
Proposition 227, approved by 61percent of voters, does not
discriminate against minorities or violate a federal law requiring
schools to educate students with limited English proficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents' fears of harm to the students ``are legitimate
concerns, apparently supported by many experts,'' Legge said in his
48-page ruling. But other experts, he said, supported the
proposition's approach, and he was neither qualified nor required
to resolve their disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to take effect next month, the law gives
non-English-speaking children a year to learn English in intensive
language training before moving into regular classes. After 30
days, parents could request native-language instruction, but they
would need permission from school officials.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Unz, the Silicon Valley millionaire who spearheaded the
initiative, heralded the court ruling as the start of a new era in
education for California's 1.4 million limited-English-proficient
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased,'' Unz said. ``It was a victory for the
people of California, for the overwhelming majority of Californians
who supported the initiative in landslide numbers, and for the
hundreds of thousands of immigrant children who will finally be
taught English in public schools starting in September.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Stone, spokesman for the state Department of Education,
said the agency has developed emergency guidelines to enable
districts to comply with the law.
</P>
<P>
   State education board member Marina Tse said schools _ at least
temporarily _ can custom-design their English immersion programs
because the state doesn't have a formal definition for such
curricula.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any way they set it up is fine,'' Tse said, adding that the
state board will begin drawing up guidelines under which parents
can seek the program waivers.
</P>
<P>
   In Glendale, 49 percent of the district's 30,200 students have
limited English proficiency. Of those, 12 percent are enrolled in
bilingual education. The remaining 37 percent receive special
instruction in English, primarily outside their regular classes.
</P>
<P>
   District spokesman Pallos fears that many immigrant students
will fall behind in other subjects while learning English.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to miss the science, they're going to miss the
history and all those other subjects during the period of time
we're going to be trying to do the intensive English immersion
program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Unz said students would continue to learn other subjects _
just in English. Secondary students, who might have a harder time
grasping a new language, could opt out of the program with special
waivers signed by their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Canady said the Burbank district is developing a contingency
plan for its estimated 500 to 1,000 bilingual education students.
English immersion already is offered at some elementary schools in
the district, and about 60 percent of its teachers are trained to
teach English immersion. But six elementary schools offer
traditional bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that classes that already are set for September are
going to have to be redone to some extent,'' said Canady, who
foresees trouble in the years ahead for California's public
schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more we're not talking education, we're talking
political decisions, and it's unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Other districts said they either had too few
limited-English-proficient students for the new law to have much
effect or already use English immersion programs.
</P>
<P>
   Like the neighboring Conejo Valley Unified School District, the
Las Virgenes Unified School District already has total English
immersion, with aides giving help to students who need it,
administrators said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Santa Clarita Valley north of Los Angeles, the Saugus
Union School District has the most elementary students and schools,
but its population of limited-English-proficient students is small,
at just 4 percent, said Assistant Superintendent Joan Lucid.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that just weeks ago a group of L.A. school district
teachers vowed to defy Proposition 227 in the classroom, Zacarias
said he is confident that they will follow the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,'' he said. ``Our
teachers are professionals.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ever since the collapse of communism, Hollywood
has been searching for villains. For a while it looked as if South
Africans might fit the bill (see, if you can stand it, ``Lethal
Weapon 2''). But then apartheid collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief fashion for demonizing the English, as in
``Braveheart,'' in which the English army rapes and pillages its
way across Scotland, and the ``Die Hard'' films, in which English
actors play East German terrorists in pursuit of Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   But then there was always Hugh Grant in the wings, to prove that
the English are just a bunch of charming fops after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow Never Dies'' tapped a rich seam of villainy with its
megalomaniac media baron. But many studio heads _ particularly at
Fox _ may be content to leave that seam unmined.
</P>
<P>
   When all else fails, space aliens and giant lizards can be quite
useful. But their appeal seldom extends to people with a mental age
above ten.
</P>
<P>
   At last, however, Hollywood has solved the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) are in many ways like
communism. They are designed by pointy-headed intellectuals. They
are manned by a Kafkaesque bureaucracy. And they reduce individual
freedom in the name of the greatest good of the greatest number.

   LOS ANGELES _ Ever since the collapse of communism, Hollywood
has been searching for villains. For a while it looked as if South
Africans might fit the bill (see, if you can stand it, ``Lethal
Weapon 2''). But then apartheid collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief fashion for demonizing the English, as in
``Braveheart,'' in which the English army rapes and pillages its
way across Scotland, and the ``Die Hard'' films, in which English
actors play East German terrorists in pursuit of Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   But then there was always Hugh Grant in the wings, to prove that
the English are just a bunch of charming fops after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow Never Dies'' tapped a rich seam of villainy with its
megalomaniac media baron. But many studio heads _ particularly at
Fox _ may be content to leave that seam unmined.
</P>
<P>
   When all else fails, space aliens and giant lizards can be quite
useful. But their appeal seldom extends to people with a mental age
above ten.
</P>
<P>
   At last, however, Hollywood has solved the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) are in many ways like
communism. They are designed by pointy-headed intellectuals. They
are manned by a Kafkaesque bureaucracy. And they reduce individual
freedom in the name of the greatest good of the greatest number.
</P>
<P>
   In one way, they are even better than communism: they directly
touch the lives of at least half the American population.

   CHICAGO _ The wrecking ball is swinging in Chicago. The city's
housing authority has demolished ten high-rise public-housing
buildings, including one in the notorious Robert Taylor Homes, and
has plans to demolish nearly 20 more.
</P>
<P>
   It is not merely toppling buildings; it is striking at half a
century of flawed housing policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Housing Authority (CHA), long considered the
country's worst public-housing agency, has a plan to move people
out of isolated, decrepit high-rise buildings into mixed-income
developments and private housing.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's new task, says its executive director, Joseph
Shuldiner, is not just housing the poor. It is providing people
with homes they can afford but can also bear to live in.
</P>
<P>
   Architecture, racism and even good intentions have conspired to
create a poverty trap in Chicago's housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   As elsewhere, public housing was first designed in the 1930s as
transitional housing for the working poor, often with stiff
eligibility requirements that screened out the neediest.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's special problems were born in the 1950s when local
politicians, including the mayor, Richard J. Daley, began to use
public housing to segregate the city's rapidly growing black
population.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, city builders had become enamored of Le Corbusier's
vision of urban buildings as ``islands in the sky.'' The result was
hulking high-rises in poor black neighborhoods, the worst of which
is an uninterrupted four-mile stretch of public housing on the
city's south side.
</P>
<P>
   The Robert Taylor Homes are the hallmark of this corridor _ a
clump of more than two dozen 16-story buildings, identical except
for the color of their brick and the way they face.
</P>
<P>
   The result is the biggest concentration of poverty in America.
New York and Puerto Rico have more public-housing units, but they
are mercifully spread among smaller, less isolated projects.
</P>
<P>
   Some 95 percent of CHA residents are on some kind of public
assistance, compared with roughly 25 percent in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, CHA buildings are magnets for drugs and crime. For
a brief period in March, the U.S. Postal Service refused to deliver
letters to the Robert Taylor Homes because the postmen feared for
their safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motto says to deliver mail in rain, sleet, and snow, but
it doesn't say anything about dodging bullets,'' Chicago's
postmaster, Rufus Porter, explained.
</P>
<P>
   What set the wrecking ball swinging after decades of apathy and
despair? First, the CHA's legendary mismanagement and lawlessness
caused patience to snap.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the then-federal housing secretary, Henry Cisneros,
stepped in and took over the agency. Among his reasons, Cisneros
cited the fact that two boys, aged 10 and 11, had recently dropped
a five-year-old out of the 14th-floor window of a CHA building.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros gave the job of rescuing the agency to Shuldiner, who
had run both the New York and the Los Angeles housing authorities.
</P>
<P>
   To help him, Shuldiner had the recently created Hope VI program,
which provides federal money for revitalizing the worst of public
housing; it has made grants to housing authorities in 26 states,
ranging from just over $1 million in Helena, Mont., to $50 million
for the redevelopment of Chicago's Cabrini Green project.
</P>
<P>
   If Hope VI was the carrot, the Republican majority in Congress
in Washington soon provided the stick. Congress passed legislation
in 1996 creating a viability test for all large public-housing
projects more than 10 percent of whose homes are empty.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires public-housing authorities to decide whether
improving such projects is cheaper than simply giving residents
vouchers to find private housing. If not, they are to be ``removed
from the public-housing inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   A stunning 17,859 units in Chicago failed the test. Their
removal has started, in a thunderous crash.
</P>
<P>
   But the CHA balked at finding private housing for the 12,000
families affected, partly because money for the necessary vouchers
was not available.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the agency has gone back to Washington with a new plan.
This would still demolish 11,000 public-housing units, but it would
also improve existing housing and build new mixed-income
developments.
</P>
<P>
   The model is Cabrini Green, which sits near some of the city's
most valuable property.
</P>
<P>
   The CHA is building a development of which half will be private
housing, 20 percent ``affordable housing'' (for families with
between 80 percent and 100 percent of the median income) and 30
percent homes for those poor enough to qualify for full
public-housing help. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (525-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Will all this make a serious difference? The evidence suggests
that it will.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, a Chicago woman who lived in public housing, Dorothy
Gautreaux, sued the CHA for using racial discrimination in its
selection of sites. As a result, roughly 30,000 CHA residents were
given homes in desegregated neighborhoods either in the city or the
surrounding suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   James Rosenbaum, a sociology professor at Northwestern
University, decided to find out whether women and children who
moved to the suburbs fared better than those who stayed in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   They did. It took most of them some time to settle in, of
course. But after that more of the suburban women than of the city
ones got themselves jobs, especially if they had never worked
before.
</P>
<P>
   The effects on the children were even more pronounced. They were
more likely to graduate from high school, more likely to graduate
from college, more likely to be employed and then likely to earn
higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   The CHA plan is not nearly as radical as this. Still, it seems
reasonable to think that getting people out of bad neighborhoods
will improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the housing department in Washington has yet to approve
the Chicago plan. The CHA's scheme does not meet the letter of the
law; it takes too long; it costs too much.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Washington's hesitation may be that Cisneros, who
provided much of the push behind the Chicago plan, has left the
department.
</P>
<P>
   His successor, Andrew Cuomo, is accused of self-promotion.
(``Warm and fuzzy he is not,'' says one former CHA official.) He is
also less committed to the demolition of high-rises; to destroy
existing homes, however decrepit, clashes with his long commitment
to help the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   There are also pockets of resistance among public-housing
residents and their advocates. Some worry that private-housing
vouchers merely move the poor around.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have thousands of people that you move without
addressing their condition, they're just going to be poor somewhere
else,'' says Wardell Yotaghan, a co-founder of the Coalition to
Protect Public Housing.
</P>
<P>
   Others rightly point out that demolishing buildings and
relocating residents with private-housing vouchers diminishes the
total housing stock. Cynics also suppose that the CHA has begun to
demolish buildings because the land beneath them has become
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   For all this, the Chicago plan has several things going for it.
It has the blessing of Chicago's powerful Mayor Richard M. Daley,
who knows the city has long had cause to feel bad about its public
housing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the young Daley can remedy one of his father's mistakes.
The mayor has offered more than praise for the CHA; he has put up
money, land and improvements in the infrastructure. The city
contributed 50 acres for the Cabrini Green redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the CHA's ideas bear the imprint of the tenants
themselves. The redevelopment plan for each project was drawn up by
a professional planner working with local residents. The residents
of the Robert Taylor Homes voted to demolish all of their 28
buildings. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All this should be good news for public-housing residents. It
may also signal something deeper. With unemployment low and the
economy booming, the country is beginning to tackle some of its
most intractable problems. &QL;

<P>
   ``If you have thousands of people that you move without
addressing their condition, they're just going to be poor somewhere
else,'' says Wardell Yotaghan, a co-founder of the Coalition to
Protect Public Housing.
</P>
<P>
   Others rightly point out that demolishing buildings and
relocating residents with private-housing vouchers diminishes the
total housing stock. Cynics also suppose that the CHA has begun to
demolish buildings because the land beneath them has become
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   For all this, the Chicago plan has several things going for it.
It has the blessing of Chicago's powerful Mayor Richard M. Daley,
who knows the city has long had cause to feel bad about its public
housing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the young Daley can remedy one of his father's mistakes.
The mayor has offered more than praise for the CHA; he has put up
money, land and improvements in the infrastructure. The city
contributed 50 acres for the Cabrini Green redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the CHA's ideas bear the imprint of the tenants
themselves. The redevelopment plan for each project was drawn up by
a professional planner working with local residents. The residents
of the Robert Taylor Homes voted to demolish all of their 28
buildings. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All this should be good news for public-housing residents. It
may also signal something deeper. With unemployment low and the
economy booming, the country is beginning to tackle some of its
most intractable problems. &QL;

   TOKYO _ An outright showdown is looming as Foreign Minister
Keizo Obuchi, backed by the ruling party's largest faction, is set
to formally announce his candidacy for the Liberal Democratic
Party's presidency as early as July 16, while Health and Welfare
Minister Junichiro Koizumi also said he may also vie for the post.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi on July 15 gained virtual approval for his candidacy at a
meeting of LDP politicians belonging to the party faction he heads.
Former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama, known within the
party as a power broker, at the meeting did not oppose Obuchi's
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   He is also expected to publicize his specific idea of what sort
of government his leadership would aim to create at the official
announcement of his candidacy, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Koizumi, meanwhile, said Wednesday he is aware that intraparty
support for him as an opponent to Obuchi is ``more vocal than
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to watch the situation carefully to decide if I
have any chance of winning (the party presidential race),'' Koizumi
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitsuzuka faction, headed by former Finance Minister Hiroshi
Mitsuzuka and to which Koizumi belongs to, also held a meeting on
July 15 and started considering whether the group should back
Koizumi as a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The stepping up of the rivalry over the selection of the party
president, who will succeed resigning Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, marks a sharp shift in the party's approach to
intraparty elections, the party sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi had hoped to secure behind-the-scenes support for his
leadership before making his intentions known publicly. But the
public's growing distaste for traditional factional jockeying made
it clear that a more conventional contest for the party presidency
is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Although a more open leadership election _ which may be held at
the July 21 meeting of LDP members from both Diet chambers _ means
Obuchi will have to compete openly with other contenders, public
perception of the process made the election necessary, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other LDP politicians who may also join the race to head the
party include ex-party president Yohei Kono and even former Prime
Ministers Kiichi Miyazawa and Yasuhiro Nakasone, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Allies of Obuchi _ who has an overwhelming support base not only
from his own faction but from other factions like the one headed by
Miyazawa _ said the foreign minister's leadership is needed for
Japan to maintain its current positive ties with such key nations
as Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But some party members, and even some members of the foreign
media, argue that Obuchi's skills for carrying out sound economic
policies are untested. They hint that the financial markets would
not react positively to Obuchi being in the prime minister's chair.
</P>
<P>
   Younger LDP members, who are calling for Koizumi's presidency,
claim the self-styled reformist is the only person who can rival
Naoto Kan, leader of Minshuto (Democratic Party of Japan) and the
voters' favorite, according to many opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is that with Obuchi at the head of the LDP, the
ruling party would be dealt another severe blow in the next Lower
House election.
</P>
<P>
   Koizumi also said on July 14 if Obuchi does not renounce LDP
policies put in place by Hashimoto, he might win the party
presidency but lose the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has not official announced he will seek the LDP top
spot, Koizumi hinted he may run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am watching the developments (of the intraparty debate),''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koizumi, often referred to as the ``lone wolf,'' is known as a
staunch advocate of the privatization of the nation's postal
services.
</P>
<P>
   He became known nationwide when he ran for the party
presidential race three years ago, when Hashimoto was almost
certain to win without an election.
</P>
<P>
   Kajiyama's advantage is the leading role he has played so far in
presenting proposals to tackle the nation's economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Kajiyama advocated shifting from Hashimoto's belt-tightening
polices earlier than many other politicians. His suggestions for
disposing of the banking bad loans are believed to have been
positively received by the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   But Kajiyama's greatest disadvantage is that only a limited
number of leading politicians, such as Nakasone, support him. Some
LDP members warn that Kajiyama's leadership would eventually lead
to an alliance with the Liberal Party, led by Ichiro Ozawa.
</P>
<P>
   Many LDP members still view Ozawa with disdain after he left the
LDP to create an anti-LDP government.
</P>
<P>
   Calls for Miyazawa to take over as prime minister again are
meant to prevent intraparty squabbles from becoming too serious,
LDP sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Kono may bring a positive reaction from voters, but he lacks the
support base in the party, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Nakasone, meanwhile, said he will refrain from entering the race
at this time. &QL;

HERSHISER BEATS DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As Orel Hershiser walked through the late
afternoon shadows of Dodger Stadium, he refused to give in to the
twilight.
</P>
<P>
   There were old teammates in the stands and as many old memories
as there were faces in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But at age 40, Hershiser blocked out the echoes Wednesday and
did what he always has done best _ win a game in a pennant race
when his team needed him most.
</P>
<P>
   He lasted six innings on three days rest, giving his new team,
the San Francisco Giants, an emotional 5-3 victory over the Los
Angeles Dodgers, his first love, in front of 34,596.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to run up the tunnel before I went out there to collect
myself,'' Hershiser said. ``And then I threw three straight balls
to the first hitter. It was all still there, the mound, the past. I
told myself, `this is about the future now.'''
</P>
<P>
   The victory snapped a five-game losing streak for the Giants and
moved them 5{ games ahead of the Dodgers in the National League
wild-card race. It also dropped the Dodgers 13{ games behind N.L.
West-leading San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly it was more than that.
</P>
<P>
   It was about Hershiser (8-7) taking the ball the way he had when
he won the 1988 Cy Young Award and World Series MVP the same year.
He was replacing Shawn Estes, the Giants' best pitcher a year ago,
in the rotation after Estes complained of shoulder stiffness that
could land him on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had won the first two games of the series and were
desperate for a sweep, heading into St. Louis for four games
beginning tonight. Hershiser even fell behind 3-0 after three
innings. But then the bulldog, the nickname given him by his former
manager Tom Lasorda, began to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   He shut down the Dodgers for his final three innings. The Giants
tied the game on home runs by Jeff Kent and Brent Mayne in the
fourth off Darren Dreifort (5-8) and went ahead for good when Mayne
singled home J.T. Snow in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all he had done for us, it was time to get him out of
there,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said. ``He came in on three
days rest and did everything we asked. That is the way the guy has
always been.''
</P>
<P>
   As he walked in after warming up, Hershiser received a mild
ovation from crowd. The game began at 5:05 and many fans were still
on the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been gone 3{ years,'' said Hershiser, who signed with
Cleveland after the 1994 season. ``A lot of things have been going
on here. Plus, I don't know if fans here are feeling very
sympathetic about baseball these days.''
</P>
<P>
   After throwing three consecutive balls to Wilton Guerrero to
open the bottom of the first, Hershiser stepped off the rubber to
collect himself.
</P>
<P>
   He got Guerrero to fly to right then struck out Juan Castro and
Raul Mondesi to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser (8-7), who defeated the Dodgers 6-3 on July 3 in San
Francisco, had been struggling through most of his previous five
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, he allowed a run in the second and two in the third
when Mondesi singled home two runs. There was no shame in getting
hit by Mondesi, who went 14 for 25 (.560) in six games against the
Giants this month.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort was getting the better of the game until the fourth,
when Kent opened with a homer. After retiring Snow on an infield
out, Dreifort walked Stan Javier and hung a slider to Mayne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a problem with the pitch I threw Kent,''
Dreifort said. ``I had a big problem with the pitch I threw Mayne.
And I never should have walked Javier. One bad inning, but that's
one too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, like Hershiser 10 years ago, is a power pitcher with a
sharp sinker. But he said he was not affected by the nostalgia
surrounding Wednesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Others were convinced it was just Hershiser's night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could just see all the adrenaline in him tonight,'' said
Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman, who played with Hershiser in 1987.
``He was pumped. We wanted this win with St. Louis coming up, but
we couldn't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, who signed with the Giants during the off-season
after three years in Cleveland, actually has played with very few
of today's Dodgers. Aside from Mondesi, Eric Karros is the only
teammate left.
</P>
<P>
   But probably his biggest emotions were reserved for physical
therapist Pat Screnar, who helped him resume his career in 1990
after Hershiser underwent radical reconstructive shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Former teammates Steve Garvey, Steve Yeager, Ken Landreaux and
even fired manager Bill Russell were on hand. But this one was as
much for Screnar as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very weird seeing Pat in the dugout,'' Hershiser said.
``He's the reason I'm still pitching.''

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Tamecka Dixon scored six of her team-high 22
points in overtime Wednesday night, giving the Sparks their first
victory over the Sacramento Monarchs, 81-76, before an announced
crowd of 5,774 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Toler and Lisa Leslie had 16 points each for the Sparks,
who improved to 5-9 with the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not allowing them to sweep us for the season is definitely a
positive, but we have to be ready for Houston on Friday night,''
said Leslie, who also had seven rebounds and six assists.
</P>
<P>
   The win snapped a three-game losing streak against the Monarchs,
who fell to 4-11. But it didn't come easily for the Sparks, who
played their first overtime game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Monarchs' Tangela Smith missed a layup, and Toler got the
rebound and passed it down the court to Lisa Leslie, who shipped it
to Mwadi Mabika, giving the Sparks a 75-71 edge with 2:07 to play
in the extra period.
</P>
<P>
   Smith cut it to two with a layup with 1:42 to play, but she was
later forced to foul Dixon, who made two free throws with 19.3
seconds remaining, giving the Sparks a four-point advantage. Mabika
converted a pair of free throws 10 seconds later to seal the win.
</P>
<P>
   In regulation, Latasha Byears scored with 17.3 seconds to go to
tie the score at 73. The Sparks who have not shown they can wrap up
a close game in the final seconds, stayed true to form.
</P>
<P>
   Ticha Penicheiro stole the ball from Toler, but was called for
traveling, giving the ball back to Sparks. With nine-tenths of a
second to go in regulation, time ran out on Leslie, who missed a
10-foot baseline shot.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Sacramento had used a 12-2 run to erase a 10-point
Sparks lead. With 2:46 to play, a putback by Adia Barnes tied the
score at 63 for the first time since the opening minutes of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, the Sparks shot 47 percent (14 of 30) to the
Monarchs' 29 percent (11 of 41) to take a 35-24 halftime lead.
Leslie led the charge with 13 points and blocked four shots.
</P>
<P>
   Byears struggled in the first half, missing eight of her 10
attempts, while Barnes was 1 of 6 from the field for Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks led by as many as 14 points three times in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   On one such occasion, the Monarchs trimmed their deficit to
31-21 on back-to-back baskets by Franthea Price. But Eugenia Rycraw
and Dixon both scored to give the Sparks their third 14-point
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   However, Penicheiro was open for a 3-pointer with 33.3 seconds
left, to close the gap for Sacramento, and with time winding down
she stole the ball from Dixon to deny the Sparks the last shot.
</P>
<P>
   Byears finished with 16 points for the Monarchs.

DALY BRINGS PERSPECTIVE, IRONS TO OPEN 
</HEADLINE>

   SOUTHPORT, England _ Amid the trepidations, lamentations and
exclamations that came from those golfers who tramped the
gale-scoured links of Royal Birkdale while holding down their
derbies, there was this from John Daly on the eve of the oldest of
tournaments:
</P>
<P>
   Let the wind blow.
</P>
<P>
   Daly has seen worse things.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the wind blows hard, I've got a chance,'' he said
Wednesday, offering the least apprehension of any of the world's
great golfers about Thursday's commencement of the 127th British
Open on the shores of the Irish Sea. ``If it stops and guys make
putts, I don't have as good a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   As one who has already won an Open, in 1995 at St. Andrews, and
as one who has the power to tear a hole in the breeze, Daly is
about as unaffected by Thursday's expected conditions as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   And as one who has been affected by many other conditions, wind
hardly ranks as his most formidable adversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day that I wake up is like winning a major,'' Daly said.
``I've been doing real good the last 15 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly is, of course, the most public of recovering alcoholics in
major professional sports. His multiple falls from the wagon have
provided some of the most poignant drama in golf.
</P>
<P>
   So far, his current sobriety has served him well in mind, soul
and golf. He even reunited with his third wife, Paulette, about two
months ago. But his body ... well, he can't have everything.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has attempted to eat everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burgers, pizza, steak, any chocolate I can get my hands on,''
he explained of his nutritional regimen that swelled his 5-foot-11
frame to 247 pounds in March. He's since dropped 20 pounds, but he
remains as round as his game is long.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tend to go from one addiction to another,'' Daly said.
``My addiction seems to be food now. My mind is tougher but my body
is changing a lot. I'm overweight and out of shape.''
</P>
<P>
   But to the profound joy of middle-agers everywhere, Daly not
only seems unbothered by the corpulence, he thinks it might have
given him a tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually helped because my right arm hugs this fat belly
right here,'' he said, clutching his side. ``It never gets out of
place now. When I lose weight, (my arm) flies all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way, I guess, I'm made. I'm made to be fat, so
there's no sense in worrying about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly, 32, now is possessed of the ballast _ or sand, as
ex-Seahawk coach Chuck Knox used to say admiringly of his
heavy-butted offensive linemen _ that can resist the urgent air
that circles and swoops over the dunes here that once, in 1961,
ripped the press tent from its moorings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the wind blows like this, par is one helluva score,'' he
said of the par-70 links, considerably toughened and improved since
the Open last rotated through here in 1991. Even though the course
is 7,018 yards, Daly said he's likely to keep his legendary driver
in his bag, to the disappointment of his many British fans who want
to see the first man to reach Ireland from England with a golf
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You miss a fairway here, you can't really advance the ball
unless you get a good lie,'' he said. ``You're dead. There is no
let-up. You can't really go to a hole and say, `This is a birdie
hole here.'''
</P>
<P>
   During a practice round Wednesday, Daly went
uncharacteristically conservative, almost completely abandoning his
driver to avoid the gorse, which is plant life that dreams of
growing up to become barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   He did the same last month for the first two rounds of the U.S.
Open in San Francisco, making like Jay Buhner forced to lay down
multiple sacrifice bunts.
</P>
<P>
   Drove him crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My patience lasted two days at the U.S. Open,'' he said,
referring to the unleashing of his driver that inflated his gallery
as well as his score.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it has been and probably always will be for Daly
_ mercurial. He has won only four tournaments in his PGA career,
but two were majors, including the 1991 PGA. Last year his best
tourney finish was seventh, but he remains one of the game's most
charismatic figures, particularly here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I've been over here, it's wonderful,'' he said.
``Everywhere I've been, it's great. That motivates me more than
anything. I can't have anything better, gallery-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   He would love to entertain his followers, but he fears the
consequences of unsheathing his terrible, swift sword.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the problem with my life right now _ I don't know how
the hell I'm going to wake up every morning,'' he said. ``I don't
know what mood I'm going to be in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I'm saying I'm going to hit irons. Tomorrow I may wake
up and hit the driver on the first hole. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   That is perhaps the most endearing thing about Daly. In a field
of men who tend to think they are masters of their universes, Daly
suffers no illusions about having all the answers.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing he knows for sure this week is that he wants to
get his cherubic behind among some kindred folk at an Alcoholics
Anonymous meeting somewhere here in the pastoral suburbs of
Lancashire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to find a meeting, or just have one,'' Daly said,
chuckling. ``There's drunks all over this world, man _ we're
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   What wind?
</P>
<P>
   What fat?
</P>
<P>
   What putt?
</P>
<P>
   Some days _ many days _ are made simply by waking up.

ALL IN ALL, JUST A BRICK IN THE WALK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Drat! The phone lines at Ticketmaster were totally
jammed Wednesday, which meant I could not place the order for my
brick.
</P>
<P>
   What brick, you ask?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the people in charge of the Mariners' new $425 million
ballpark are going to let baseball fans have a little piece of
Safeco Field glory, with the operative word here being ``little.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Public Facilities District announced that for $75
plus tax, you can purchase a brick. That price includes having your
brick inscribed and placed in the sidewalk along the Royal Brougham
Fan Walk. (Just call 206-622-4487, if you can get through.)
</P>
<P>
   That's quite a bargain for getting your name on The House That
Griffey Built. Or is it The House That John Ellis Built? I forget.
But it's not a bad deal considering Safeco Insurance will shell out
$40 million (over 20 years) for exclusive naming rights to the new
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Forty million or $75, plus tax? It's a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For Safeco, the ballpark will be a major feature in branding its
corporate name. Savvy business practice of the '90s foisted upon us
_ the doltish, voiceless general population.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who lost sleep over the selling of Safeco Field should
not exactly blame the insurance guys. Stadia all over this fair
land have come to be drably named: Bank One Ballpark, Qualcomm
Park, the RCA Dome and KeyArena. Yawners, huh?
</P>
<P>
   The only thing to be sorry about is that a more radically named
company (like Amazon.com, Yahoo! or Bed, Bath &AMP; Beyond) didn't have
the nerve to outbid Safeco. Then we'd be excited about our new
ballyard, all right.
</P>
<P>
   At least with this bricks-for-fans announcement, Mariner fans
and concerned taxpayers who felt betrayed by the corporate sellout
have a chance to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   Brick inscription suggestion No. 1:
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Safeco: Brand This!
</P>
<P>
   And think of the entertainment value. Imagine the fun you and
your family will have at the new park, roaming Royal Brougham Fan
Walk in search of your personalized brick. Heck, you might hardly
care if Griffey is going 4-for-5 with two jacks and an
over-the-back Willie Mays catch. You'll have more important
business, like visiting your brick!
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, look, honey. There it is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where? I don't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right there, next to that cluster of Dr. Martens and Nikes.
... Excuse me, sir. Could I ask you to step over a little? You're
standing on our brick. Thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of allowing people to purchase an inscribed brick is
hardly novel. Many of the new parks have done it. And in Atlanta
during the 1996 Summer Olympics, Centennial Park was a sea of
inscripted red bricks, all of which survived the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, Pike Place Market raised $1.6 million for renovation
and a new floor in 1986 when 45,600 tiles were sold to the public
for $35 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   So the Safeco Field brick idea isn't totally awful, especially
since the money raised for selling upwards of 10,000 bricks will be
used not to defray construction costs, but to pay for a baseball
museum _ one that will feature memorabilia from Little League to
the Pacific Coast League.
</P>
<P>
   However, the metaphor involved in the inscripted brick walkway
is just a little too rich to let slip by us.
</P>
<P>
   Brick inscription suggestion No. 2:
</P>
<P>
   Hi, I'm a taxpayer. Step on me.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads us to the logical question: What are you going to
say on your brick?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A lot of diehard baseball lovers will see this brick thing as a
fun opportunity. This includes my brother, who told me Wednesday he
plans to buy a brick and inscribe it with the name of his
soon-to-be-born child _ which I hope isn't a boy since my brother's
favorite baseball player was Lenny Dykstra and I couldn't tolerate
a nephew named ``Nails.''
</P>
<P>
   We're all for free speech, but it just makes sense that some of
the more cynical among us will be tempted to use this brick thing
as a form of personal protest. After all, a bulk of Seattle and
King County citizens did not actually agree to this stadium, since
the September 1995 public referendum fell a few votes short of
approval.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium naysayers could, for the soul-cleansing price of $75
plus tax, undertake a bit of mischief now, laying such zesty bricks
as:
</P>
<P>
   Mr. and Mrs. Thiss Z. Aripoff.
</P>
<P>
   The Fuhd-Stampz Family
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ineeda Tacks Break
</P>
<P>
   Jack Thisoneout, Jr.
</P>
<P>
   On Grand Opening Night next July, who will join me out on Royal
Brougham Fan Walk, searching for amusing rebel bricks like these?
</P>
<P>
   It's a date, then. We'll head out there immediately after Pink
Floyd sings the national anthem, just as the rock group launches
into its famous song.
</P>
<P>
   You can almost hear it now ... 45,600 fans crammed into the
natural-grass Safeco Field, Griffey in center and eight minor
leaguers surrounding him. We'll sing in unison: ``All in all you're
just another brick in the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   A fitting tribute to the real builders of Seattle's new
ballyard.
</P>
<P>
   Just another brick in the wall, or walk, indeed.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For years, Saddam Hussein has been waging an
energetic propaganda campaign, claiming that the Iraqi people are
the victims of sanctions imposed on Iraq by the international
community. Let's get it straight: Saddam Hussein is responsible for
the suffering of his people.
</P>
<P>
   These sanctions are targeted directly at the Iraqi regime,
because of its continued refusal to live up to the conditions it
accepted at the end of the Gulf War, including those demanding the
elimination of its weapons of mass destruction capacity. These
sanctions are not directed at the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that Saddam, eager to keep as much money or supplies
as he can grab, has deprived his people and then used their
suffering as a means to increase support for lifting sanctions. It
is a policy that is both cynical and cruel, and must not be allowed
to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the sanctions, which will remain in place
until the Iraqi regime complies with all relevant U.N. resolutions,
have never precluded the shipment of humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, the international community is committed to
ensuring that Iraqis have access to the primary humanitarian goods
they need.
</P>
<P>
   These sanctions have a very specific purpose: to remove Saddam's
capacity to threaten his neighbors and the world with an arsenal of
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   He has shown that he is willing to use such weapons against his
neighbors and his own people. This jeopardizes the security and
stability of the region and challenges vital U.S. national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the economic sanctions and the concurrent
U.N. weapons inspections have been very effective in reducing
Iraq's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, despite the regime's
attempts to obstruct and reluctance to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Had Saddam chosen to fulfill his obligations and fully disclose
his weapons programs, significant progress toward the lifting of
sanctions could have been achieved long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Because of our commitment not to jeopardize the dignity and
well-being of the Iraqi people, the United Nations, led by the
United States, proposed the oil for food program in 1991,
immediately after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   For almost six years, Saddam said ``no'' to such a program
because he wanted to control the revenues that oil sales would
generate _ a condition that the United Nations refused to accept.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Saddam finally agreed to cooperate with the program and
sell oil, the profits from which are placed in a U.N.-controlled
escrow account to be used to pay for food, medicine and other basic
necessities.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, more than $3 billion worth of supplies have
successfully been delivered to the Iraqi people. This effort has
substantially improved the diet of the average Iraqi.
</P>
<P>
   To even further address Iraq's needs, the United States has
strongly supported renewed efforts within the United Nations to
expand the humanitarian relief effort this year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the provisions of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1153,
the largest relief operation in U.N. history will be made available
to the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   This program will offer more humanitarian assistance to the
Iraqi people over the course of one year than was provided by the
United Nations for global humanitarian assistance in the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam claims that the humanitarian goods paid for from the sale
of up to $10.4 billion worth of oil every year under resolution
1153 will not suffice, and he continues to demand that the
sanctions be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   But his real motive, as demonstrated by his record of misrule,
is clearly not to help his people but to get his hands on hard cash
in order to support his own personal and political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Resolution 1153 not only provides humanitarian goods, it also
allows for the reconstruction of Iraq's civilian infrastructure,
including water and sanitation facilities. Under great
international pressure, Saddam has submitted a plan, acceptable to
the United Nations, for the distribution of funds among these
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The international community hopes that he will indeed move to
ease, not impede, the flow of assistance to his people. But, in the
event that the regime reverts to its obstructive behavior, we are
consulting with other governments and the community of
nongovernmental organizations on how best to deliver goods and
services to the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to supplying goods to meet the Iraqi people's day to
day needs, we are working with other countries to supply
educational equipment, so that Iraq will not lose a generation to
ignorance and will be able, post-Saddam, to reclaim its historical,
cultural, intellectual and political role within the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   We have made it eminently clear since the implementation of the
sanctions that we have the highest regard for the Iraqi people and
support the territorial unity and the integrity of their country.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi people deserve better than the rule of Saddam. Until
they are relieved of that burden, we are determined to see that
everything is done to ensure that they can enjoy as decent a life
as is possible under an indecent regime. We will not cease to work
toward that objective. &QL;

MARTINEZ MASTERFUL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ These are the games, so precious and few, that become
even better in the retelling, because they usually happen just once
or so in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   What Roger Clemens did here, 11 years ago, Pedro Martinez
duplicated Wednesday night before a packed house of 33,501 in
Fenway Park that sweated and screamed and sweated some more before
Martinez completed a 1-0, four-hit, nine-strikeout masterpiece over
the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching in tropical heat more suited for his native Manoguayabo
than for Yawkey Way, and with the new 1999 All-Star logo adorning
the Green Monster as backdrop behind him, Martinez outdueled fellow
Dominican All-Star Bartolo Colon while shutting down one of
baseball's most dangerous lineups on just four singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A game like this, you take it home and flavor (sic) it,'' said
Martinez, who insisted there was no bitter aftertaste left from
being skipped over last week as the All-Star starter by Cleveland
manager Mike Hargrove, who Wednesday night had no choice but to
watch Martinez at the absolute top of his craft.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox manager Jimy Williams had Tom Gordon warming up in the
bullpen, but said there was no question that Martinez would come
out for the ninth, giving him the chance to be the first pitcher
since Clemens to record a 1-0 complete-game win in Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to pick up my teammates a little bit,'' Martinez
said, alluding to a Red Sox offense that has yet to find itself in
the second half. ``They did it for me when I was struggling, and
now it was my turn.''
</P>
<P>
   The only run Wednesday night was scored on a fifth-inning home
run by DH Midre Cummings, who has barely been heard from since his
two electrifying home runs in late April against the Tigers, five
days apart. Cummings, the stand-in for newly disabled Reggie
Jefferson, delivered a 408-foot home run into the right-field
grandstand to open the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chibo is in the house,'' said Martinez, who for reasons known
only to himself has decided Cummings's nickname should be the
Spanish word for goat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I saw Midre hit that ball, I said, `I will have to win
with that one. I will win with that one.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cummings had driven in just two runs in just 33 at-bats since
June 1, but launched a first-pitch fastball from Colon into the
seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time before, we struck him out with the same pitch,'' said
Indians catcher Sandy Alomar. ``We tried to go in and back him off
the plate a little bit, but the pitch was on the white and not the
black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he'd keep it fair, but he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, 12-3 after his second complete-game shutout, has an
ERA of 1.17 in his last six starts, giving up just six earned runs
in 46 innings. He allowed singles by Manny Ramirez and Alomar
(infield hit) in the second, then did not allow another hit until
Brian Giles singled with two out in the seventh. In between the
hits by Alomar and Giles, he set down 15 Indians in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great, great changeup,'' said pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan. ``He threw 41 changeups, 27 for strikes, and got 11 outs
on his changeup. His fastball? He topped out at 97, was still
throwing at 95 in the ninth, and sat at 94-95 all game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome. What a show for national TV (ESPN). A baseball
night, playoff atmosphere. It was good for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez did not walk a batter until the eighth, when Alomar
drew a one-out pass, and one out later, he walked his second and
last batter, pitching carefully to pinch hitter Jim Thome. The
Indians' strongman was still feeling the effects of being hit in
the forearm by the Yankees' Andy Pettitte the night before and
wasn't in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   But with two on and two out, Martinez coaxed Kenny Lofton to pop
out to third baseman John Valentin, who opened the next inning by
making a terrific barehanded pickup of Omar Vizquel's bid for a
bunt base hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to keep him from bunting,'' said Valentin, who
stood so close to the plate he could have shaken hands with the
Indians' shortstop, ``and he still almost got a hit, that's how
great a bunt it was.''
</P>
<P>
   David Justice reached out and hit an end-of-the-bat liner into
center for the Indians' fourth hit. But Martinez blew an outside
fastball past Manny Ramirez, the Indians' cleanup hitter, and with
the fans on their feet retired Brian Giles on a game-ending tapper
to second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro did a great job, Bartolo did a great job,'' Valentin
said. ``We're fortunate that Midre got a good pitch to hit, or we'd
still be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said that long before he came to the ballpark, he
expected it would go this way against Colon, the 23-year-old
righthander who is just three years younger than Martinez but
considers Mr. Pedro his hero. But while Martinez was braced for a
duel with Colon, who still leads the league in ERA with a 2.48
mark, a fraction ahead of Martinez (2.72), the Red Sox ace said he
sensed the crowd had something else in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd was very confusing for me,'' he said. ``I saw the
fans getting on Mo (Vaughn), I don't know why. Then they were
standing for me. They weren't as loud early on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they love their offense. It was pretty quiet until the
last inning.''
</P>
<P>
   But then there was thunder on the Fens, the kind that will echo
long into memory.

DOMINICAN DANDIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Maybe it's something in the water they drink in the
Dominican Republic. The tiny country produces so many great young
arms, it's getting to be hard to keep track of them all.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox' 1-0 victory over the Cleveland Indians Wednesday
night at Fenway Park was a marvelous showdown between two of the
best Dominican pitchers in the major leagues. Pedro Martinez (12-4)
turned in his 10th career shutout, and loser Bartolo Colon made
just one mistake but wound up losing because of it.
</P>
<P>
   But anybody who saw the 99 mile-per-hour fastball on Colon's
120th and final pitch of the game will tell you the 23-year-old
pitcher is a superstar in the making. In only his second major
league season, Colon made the AL All-Star team this year.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, Colon is probably the best pitcher to come out of the
Dominican Republic since ... Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   One guess as to Colon's hero?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a honor to pitch against him,'' said Colon, who at 185
pounds dwarfs Martinez. ``Pedro was one of my idols and it was a
dream of my father to see me facing him. I felt I did a good job,
too. But I made one mistake. And in baseball, you have to pay for
that mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The mistake was a home run by Midre Cummings in the fifth
inning. Rather than throw a strike, he tried to back Cummings off
the plate with a fastball inside. He missed, and Cummings's quick
bat did the rest.
</P>
<P>
   That looked very familiar to Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told by Felipe Alou at Montreal,'' said Martinez, ``that
once when you find your rhythm, keep going. When you're throwing
strikes and doing things the way you want, keep going. He got ahead
sometimes and then he came back and threw some bad pitches. That
was me three-four years ago. I'd throw strike one or strike two
then mess around and make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's role models were Hall of Famer Juan Marichal and his
brother, Ramon. Not only were both great pitchers, they were
teachers. If Colon listens to his mentors, he might some day be as
good as Martinez. Colon not only throws in the high 90s, but he'd
be doing it the eighth and ninth innings. If he can harness that
raw power, like Martinez has learned to do, he could go a lot
farther than his 9-5 record would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy throws 100 miles an hour,'' said Martinez. ``He's
probably the best arm to come from the Dominican in the last five
years. It's funny he should look up to me. I'm smaller. It's a
great honor. Especially coming from a guy who could be 10 times
better than me.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Colon was on a shuttle between Buffalo (7-1, 2.22
ERA) and Cleveland (4-7, 5.65). With a divisional title at stake,
Colon simply had to wait his turn. But Wednesday night was his 20th
start of the season, and with each outing he gets better.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can throw the ball 98 miles an hour after throwing 140
pitches,'' said Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove. ``He's been over
130 pitches three times, but in the last inning of those games I
left him in he was there, he was throwing 98-99 m.p.h. He's a real
strong kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talent and velocity have always been there. He's just
starting to get his breaking stuff over for strikes, also his
changeup. I think he's become convinced that he can pitch in the
big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great pitching matchup,'' said Indians catcher Sandy
Alomar. ``He did a good job of getting out of jams. Unfortunately,
we didn't score a lot of runs.''

REVOLUTION FALL TO UNITED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ It's the same old frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution once again played well against D.C. United, but
once again, they fell by one goal.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Lassiter's 12th goal of the season, scored from directly in
front of the net after passes from Jaime Moreno and Mike Slivinski
in the 81st minute, gave D.C. United a 1-0 win over the Revolution
before 17,202 Wednesday night at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out to block what turned out to be a pass when Moreno
had the ball,'' said Revolution goalkeeper Ian Feuer. ``If you
stayed on, I would be asked why I didn't come out. Basically, you
have to play the one with the ball, and that's what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Just minutes before that, Lassiter headed a crossing pass from
John Harkes toward the goal, but the ball was high by about 3 feet,
causing Lassiter and Harkes to place their hands over their heads
in despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy to see him come back,'' D.C. United coach Bruce
Arena said. ``Lassiter did miss a header, but he's the type of
player whose job it is to score goals. Roy knows what he's about;
he's supposed to score goals, so when he misses some goals, he's
the first to get upset.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time in four games that D.C. United, Major
League Soccer's best team each of the previous two seasons, has
beaten the Revolution this year, twice in shootouts. Each game has
been decided by a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never pleased when we lose,'' said Revolution coach Thomas
Rongen. ``It was a heartbreaker. We played this team well, but the
difference in the game was that we didn't put in our chances, even
though we played them toe-to-toe and head-to-head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective was to get three points; we didn't come here for
a shootout,'' Arena said. ``We play tough against a lot of teams.
We're the target for other teams on our schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution (5-14) were in a 3-5-2 defensive alignment for
just the second time this season, and it worked well as they
controlled play for most of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of game D.C. United (16-5) expected, especially
when Arena saw Edwin Gorter, the Revolution's top assist man, as
the sweeper, standing in front of Revolution defenders Mike Burns
and Richard Goulooze in the different alignment.
</P>
<P>
   On the offensive end, however, the Revolution didn't fare well.
They once again had difficulty finishing off scoring opportunities.
Joe-Max Moore had his chances, as did Johnny Torres and Raul Diaz
Arce, but they all went for naught.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of chances for the Revolution: A crossing pass
from Imad Baba to Moore with 33:20 left in the first half looked
promising, but Moore was stopped. Moore had another shot along the
right side with 27 minutes left in the first half, but the ball
went wide to the right by a foot and a half. And then Diaz Arce
missed from the right side on a header, with 10:55 remaining. Two
other late first-half shots, by Baba and Torres, also went awry.
</P>
<P>
   And with 16:07 remaining in the second half, Moore tried a shot
from just inside the box from the right side, but D.C. United
netminder Scott Garlick stretched his fingers out and knocked away
the shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work on our shooting a lot,'' Rongen said. ``The players
take their shots in practice, but you can't teach a forward how to
finish. Not when he's in his mid-20s.''

ANGELS BEAT DEVIL RAYS
</HEADLINE>

By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The slumping Anaheim Angels met the slumping
Tampa Bay Devil Rays on Wednesday night at Edison Field, so
something had to give.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had lost nine of 11 and have not looked anything like
the first-place team they are. But the expansion Devil Rays snapped
an 11-game losing streak only one night earlier, and have looked
everything like a team that went into the game 33{ games out of
first place in the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   Angels first baseman Cecil Fielder broke a tie score with a solo
homer in the fourth inning, then drove in another run with a
two-out single in the fifth, helping the Angels to a 4-2 win before
a crowd of 19,681.
</P>
<P>
   With Texas losing Wednesday night, the Angels increased their AL
West lead to 1{ games.
</P>
<P>
   Though Fielder's two RBI _ giving him a team-leading 64 _
provided the margin of victory for the Angels, reliever Shigetoshi
Hasegawa (4-1) deserves most of the credit for this one.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa entered the game in the fifth inning after starter
Chuck Finley had to leave with a cut on his right knee. Finley, who
injured the knee covering first base on an infield grounder,
received ``several'' stitches and is listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa pitched 31/3 scoreless innings to get the win over
Devil Rays starter Wilson Alvarez (4-7). Troy Percival pitched 11/3
perfect innings to earn his 27th save.
</P>
<P>
   Finley sailed through the first three innings of the game before
giving up two unearned runs in the fourth. In the fifth, Dwight
Winn led off with a chopper behind the bag at first, which was
fielded cleanly by Fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, however, was late covering first, and he slid on his
knees as he tried to tag Winn going by. Winn was safe, and Finley
had a cut on his right knee that forced him out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got some kind of cut,'' Angels manager Terry Collins
said. ``When I went out there at first I thought it was just a
scrape. The only thing we could think of was that he hit a rock or
something. It was that long (two inches) and that deep (half-inch).
(Trainer) Rick Smith said he was going to need stitches, but they
couldn't close it. There was no skin left.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Angels clinging to a 3-2 lead, Hasegawa replaced Finley
and performed a high-wire act, getting himself into trouble before
getting out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa immediately gave up a hit-and-run single to Miguel
Cairo as Winn took third. After Cairo stole second, Hasegawa struck
out Quinton McCracken on a 3-2 pitch for the first out of the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa then walked Bobby Smith on a 3-2 pitch to load the
bases, but struck out Aaron Ledesma on a 3-2 pitch for the second
out of the inning. Hasegawa went 3-2 to Paul Sorrento, who fouled
out to third baseman Dave Hollins despite colliding with catcher
Matt Walbeck.

MARTINEZ, MOYER TOUGH ON TWINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In case you are wondering how long this will last _
the current group of Mariners, not their recent surge _ you're not
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez is curious, too.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is not oblivious to the rumor mill that mentions his
name in possible trades. The Mariner designated hitter remains
cool, though. Ken Griffey Jr. was much more blunt before the M's
knocked off the Minnesota Twins, 4-1, last night at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey suggested the Mariners simply blow up their new ballpark
if they trade certain players.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Martinez is on Griffey's list of untouchables.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, Martinez said he would love to play at Safeco Field.
He wants to set off the fireworks there like he has all week at the
Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about (the team trading me). It could happen,'' said
Martinez, who went 2-for-3 with a double and a home run that
propelled the Mariners to their third straight win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know what I'm
going to do if I get traded.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their 5-2 record since the All-Star break, the Mariners
figure to make a deal before the July 31 trading deadline. The club
is still 11 games behind Anaheim in the American League West. The
M's will be pressed shortly on whether they will have to start
preparing for next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners last month said they are not going to trade
disgruntled pitcher Randy Johnson. There have been rumblings of the
team moving Martinez, an aging yet effective hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``His production is good. His RBI and home run production is
where you expect him to be,'' M's manager Lou Piniella said of
Martinez. ``You're accustomed to seeing Edgar hit .330. He's
hitting .294 or .295. A lot of people would take that very
gladly.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said the Mariners haven't yet talked to him about next
season. The club has an option to pick up the final year of his
contract for more than $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he would be devastated if he were traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played here for a long time. Yes I'd be disappointed. ...
I feel like I can play. Sometimes I think I want to play four or
five more years,'' said Martinez, who later added: ``As long as I
can still hit I'm going to be playing (somewhere).''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of wins, consistent defense and pitching, the
Mariners haven't been short on power this season. Last night, the
long ball gave the Mariners breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Martinez hit two homers in a 10-3 win against the
Texas Rangers. He ignited a three-run sixth inning last night.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez put the Mariners ahead 2-1 with his 18th home run _ a
solo shot to left field. Two batters later, Dan Wilson stepped up
with Jay Buhner at first and smacked a two-run homer to virtually
the same spot.
</P>
<P>
   Both long balls came off Minnesota loser LaTroy Hawkins (5-9).
</P>
<P>
   The power surge gave the Mariners all the runs starter Jamie
Moyer needed. Moyer, who was on cruise control most of the night,
earned his sixth victory. Mike Timlin pitched the ninth for his
fourth save.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear from the start that Moyer would give himself a good
chance at a victory. In his seven losses, Moyer posted a 6.86 ERA.
Conversely, his ERA is 0.65 in the five previous wins.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer also benefitted from solid defense behind him.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have not committed an error in 242/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a big difference,'' Moyer said of the team's improved
defense. ``We don't have to throw as many pitches. It's a plus. You
can't play the game missing one or two things. You have to do
everything to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota rattled Moyer only in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Lawton led off with a base hit and took second when Paul
Molitor drew a walk. The Twins then loaded the bases after Marty
Cordova walked. Lawton eventually tagged and scored off Ron
Coomer's sacrifice fly to center.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer then got David Ortiz to ground into a double play that
ended the threat. The Twins managed only a 1-0 lead after that
frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably the key to the game,'' Moyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners tied the game in their half of the fourth behind
Buhner's RBI double. Martinez scored from first on the play after
he walked with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who is often teased for being slow, turned on the
afterburners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very fast,'' Martinez joked when asked about his
speed.

CARSON, COLISEUM REPS EXCHANGE HEAD SLAPS OVER NFL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles' desperate attempt to secure an NFL franchise and
build a football stadium is now being waged between two combatants
that view each other with total disdain.
</P>
<P>
   On the one side, you have L.A. politician Mark Ridley-Thomas,
Los Angeles Kings and Staples Center co-owner Ed Roski and Roski
business associate John Semcken making passionate pitches for a new
stadium to be erected within the ancient walls of the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, you have legendary movie talent agency mogul
Michael Ovitz putting his considerable influence behind a plan to
build a state-of-the-art stadium in Carson.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties will tell you with persuasive charm that the other
is destined to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Who to believe?
</P>
<P>
   In an interview I had a week ago with John Semcken, he insisted
an NFL franchise one day would wind up playing at the Coliseum and
that there was no chance that a football stadium ever would be
constructed in Carson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just pure fantasy that Michael Ovtiz ever will be able
to stick a stadium on landfill in Carson that is nothing more than
a toxic waste dump,'' said Semcken, Roski's point man in rebuilding
the Coliseum and getting an NFL franchise for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview I had last Monday with Michael Ovitz, he
snickered at Semcken's claim and pulled out large color prototypes
designed by David Rockwell that showed what the future stadium of
Carson and its accompanying shopping mall would look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is that things in Carson are going along just as
planned,'' said a man who has represented some of the biggest names
in the entertainment field. ``By the year 2002, Southern California
is going to have a modern new stadium and an expansion team ready
to play in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Who to believe?
</P>
<P>
   Both John Semcken and Michael Ovitz are quite convincing in
extolling the virtues of their own projects while ridiculing the
prospects of each other's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next NFL team in L.A. will play at the Coliseum,''
maintains Semcken, an engaging Naval Academy graduate and former
F-14 fighter pilot who served as a technical adviser on ``Top
Gun.'' ``There's just no other place to play. Hollywood Park is a
dead issue. And so is Carson, despite what Michael Ovitz says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the pictures they're showing of the Carson stadium
are quite impressive. But that's just sizzle. I just can't envision
them ever getting a favorable environmental report on that toxic
waste dump.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're close to signing a 50-year lease that would give our
company, New Coliseum Venture, total control over the Coliseum,
without interference from the Coliseum Commission. We're going to
completely tear down the Coliseum, but leave the outer walls and
peristyle end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coliseum will be a completely new stadium, but will still
retain the old-style appearance. We've got the necessary investors.
USC has agreed to give us an extra 10,000 parking spaces. The
entire stadium project figures to run in the $300 million range.
The Coliseum is the only place that makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't to Michael Ovitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL will never give its OK to play at the Coliseum
again,'' asserts Ovitz. ``I've been told that by more than one
owner, and there is just no way the Coliseum people would be able
to get the necessary 24 votes from the owners that are needed. They
just don't want to put a team in the area that has poor parking and
not very good freeway access.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're planning to have 12 off and on ramps around the Carson
stadium with a new overpass set to be built. The projected price of
the stadium will be $350 million, and we have people like Gary
Wilson, chairman of Northwest Airlines, Ron Burkle, who owns
hundreds of supermarkets, Tom Cruise, Kevin Costner and Magic
Johnson and others set to invest in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to build this stadium, mark my word. We've been
planning to build a mall on the property for a long time, and all
the environmental reports on the property are intact. And I'm sure
there will be no problem getting the environmental agency's OK once
we get the go-ahead from the NFL, which we expect to get sometime
this fall when the owners meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, John Semcken takes issue with Ovitz about the NFL's
reported coolness toward the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of that negative talk you hear about the Coliseum from
NFL owners is gamemanship calculated to drive up the price of the
expansion fees,'' says Semcken. ``When the league's expansion
committee realizes what we're planning to do, I'm confident that
there'll be a more positive attitude among NFL owners about the
Coliseum.''
</P>
<P>
   No way, contends Michael Ovitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL never will stick a team again at the Coliseum,''
reiterates Ovitz. ``Look, I'm not going to get into a war of words
with the Coliseum people. I'm just convinced that the best way for
the NFL to come back to L.A. is through Carson. I'm sure when Mark
Ridley-Thomas and his friends realize this is the only way to go
that they'll start supporting us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the city of Carson is 100 percent behind us. It's going
to be a wonderful stadium that will seat 67,000 and will have the
facade of a California mission. It's going to be a spectacular
sight that will be visible for people driving on the San Diego and
Harbor Freeways. It's going to be the best football stadium ever
built, and there will be parking for 30,000 cars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Carson will never happen,'' insists John Semcken, loyal
Coliseum backer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Carson stadium will be a jewel every one of us in Southern
California will be proud of,'' says Michael Ovitz, loyal Carson
backer.
</P>
<P>
   Who to believe?
</P>
<P>
   Only time will expose what side is headed in the right
direction.

NO SHOCK: MER CURY VICTORIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Continuing its push into uncharted success, the
Mercury increased its winning streak to a franchise record four
games and rose to eight games over .500 for the first time with a
methodical 73-60 win Wednesday over the Detroit Shock.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but Michele Timms guarantees a fifth straight win
Saturday over the New York Liberty, which embarrassed Phoenix at
America West Arena last season in the WNBA playoff semifinals and
won, 71-68, when the teams played June 29 at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said to each other in New York after the game, when they
come to our house, it's going to be a different story,'' Timms
said. ``We promised ourselves that. If anyone's in town, they want
to come down and watch the game because that's going to be
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Timms wore her lucky World Championships shoes _ ``I needed a
boost'' _ at the risk of being fined for the Australian green color
scheme. League officials might not even bother with the point
guard's footwear once they read Coach Cheryl Miller's comments
about the officiating.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the season-best performance by Andrea Kuklova off
the bench, Miller launched into a controlled critique of the
officials for calling tic-tac fouls away from the basket (like one
against Kuklova) but not protecting the posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reward for aggressive play by the offensive post
player or penetrator,'' said Miller, who received her second
technical foul of the season early in the second half. ``I've tried
reasoning with the officials, asking questions, and I cannot get a
consistent answer as to why so many touch officials are being
called away from the basket and nothing (underneath).
</P>
<P>
   ``Jennifer Gillom cannot get to the free-throw line, and that's
ludicrous, that's ridiculous, it's upsetting. I'm just glad she
doesn't get frustrated, but I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them to be more attune in making sure I don't dance up and
down the sidelines is ridiculous. They're more focused on my _ if
you want to call it _ antics than officiating the game. That's what
frustrating. It will probably cost me $500 or more, but I've got a
rich brother.''
</P>
<P>
   A fine is almost a certainty. Houston guard Cynthia Cooper was
tapped for $300 for criticizing officials after the defending
champion Comets' only loss of the season to the Mercury on June 24.
</P>
<P>
   Good or bad, the officiating wasn't much of a factor as Phoenix
(11-3) took the lead three minutes into the first half and never
gave it back. The game was nothing like that in Detroit a week
earlier when the expansion Shock led, 44-32, at halftime and only
succumbed, 78-76, on a buzzer-beating three-pointer by Gillom.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the type of team you don't want it to go down to the
wire,'' Miller said. ``We didn't want it to get close then have
someone win it at the buzzer like we were able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The best Mercury lineup was all reserves, considering Michelle
Griffiths is starting in place of injured Toni Foster. She and
Marlies Askamp in the post with Kristi Harrower, Kuklova and Brandy
Reed on the perimeter were the group that took the lead to a
game-high 16 points (72-56) and sent the Shock (7-9) to its fifth
loss in the last six games.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, a third-round draft pick and easily the Mercury's most
athletic player, had five points, four rebounds and four assists in
a season-high 19 minutes. Kuklova scored nine points, one off her
high, and added three assists in 17 minutes. Askamp had nine points
and Griffiths 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing what the coaches want from me,'' Reed said. ``Every
time I touch it, I don't have to score. Our ballclub is very
structured, and I'm beginning to learn that.'' &QL;

IRON MEN  
 NHL PLAYERS BOARD OFF-SEASON TRAINING EXPRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ZUCKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mental image is at first odd, maybe even a little ludicrous.
Rick Tocchet, a 13-year NHL veteran and a key member of the
Coyotes, spending his summer working out at Gold's Gym in Venice
Beach, Calif., with a 37-year-old ex-college hockey player at his
side.
</P>
<P>
   This is the famous ``Muscle Beach'' we're talking about, home to
hundreds of beefed-up wannabes who have nothing better to do than
flaunt their pecs and abs to scores of passers-by. It's the last
place you would expect to find a professional athlete diligently
working on his off-season training.
</P>
<P>
   Then you hear some of the other names involved _ Chris Chelios,
Rob Blake, Jeremy Roenick, Bob Probert, Oleg Tverdosky, Petr
Svoboda and Chris Simon. Now this starts to sound intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in the off-season anymore,'' said Tocchet, who
participates in Pro Camp, a unique training program designed
specifically for professional athletes. ``Nowadays, it's an
11-month-a-year job, maybe even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to move to LA for two months to train. It's hard to
get guys out here, but when people see the results . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The program, which Tocchet said has him feeling _ and playing _
like he is three or four years younger, is the brainchild of T.R.
Goodman, a self-professed ``frustrated athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman never realized his dream to play professionally after
lettering in college hockey and lacrosse in in the East in the
early 1980s. He went on to become an athletic trainer in
California, met several NHL players who were dissatisfied with
their own teams' training programs and decided he could do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I learned about what was available to the
professional athlete,'' Goodman said, ``the more I realized it was
a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Bold words for a relative unknown in the sports world, but words
that more professional athletes are starting to take seriously.
When Tocchet came to Goodman four years ago, looking to improve his
ailing back, Pro Camp consisted of only a handful of NHL players,
most notably Chicago Blackhawks defender Chelios.
</P>
<P>
   Word got around, though, and Goodman's program now boasts 35 to
40 NHL players, most of them veterans trying to regain their past
form or young prospects trying to gain an edge, plus a couple of
NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still ever-evolving,'' Goodman said. ``It's taken a
certain number of years for guys to come here and surrender
themselves to me and to be willing to do whatever I tell them to
unconditionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman has been able to get these athletes to ``surrender to
him'' because he caters his unique training program to each
individual. The result of his three-month program, each athlete
said, is phenomenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sees us play during the season and sees what we need to
work on,'' said Jason Doig, the Coyotes' impressive 21-year-old
defenseman who has played in only 19 NHL games in his short career.
``And he also listens to what we tell him. He combines that and
comes up with a program that's catered toward you. You're working
on stuff that you know is designed just for you. That's what makes
him special.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things Goodman does when he begins to work with
an athlete is ``try to find what the makeup of the person is.''
This includes determining such physical traits as rotated
shoulders, tilted pelvises or misaligned hips.
</P>
<P>
   For example, after Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Svoboda
underwent neck surgery last year after taking a hard hit to the
side of his head, Goodman discovered that Svoboda's shoulders are
rotated significantly forward. This caused him to pull his
trapezius muscles, placing added stress on his spine. Where other
trainers would have tried to work on Svoboda's strained muscles,
Goodman helped him bring his shoulders back to a more natural
position.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman's Pro Camp features three phases. The first,
rehabilitation of the body, includes regular visits with a massage
therapist, a structural massage therapist (who aligns your body)
and a nutritionist. The second consists of two or three weeks of
lifting heavier weights and simulated skating.
</P>
<P>
   The last, which Tocchet affectionately calls ``the dreaded
circuit,'' is headlined by one hour of constant exercise each day
for three weeks without any rest.
</P>
<P>
   The result? Players say they have an easier time surviving the
arduous NHL season without succumbing to injury or fatigue. Players
like Tocchet, Chelios and Blake, who have battled through injuries
during their careers, said they now feel they are in great shape.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Kings' Blake, for example, had been plagued by
injuries for six years before joining Pro Camp, playing in only six
games in 1995-96. Last year, he played 81 games and won the NHL's
Norris Trophy, which honors the league's top defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a coincidence,'' Tocchet said. ``There's nothing
worse than a team going into March or April and to have four or
five guys get hurt on you. I wish I knew about this when I was 20,
21 years old. I probably could have stayed injury-free.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro Camp also attracts younger hockey players, such as Doig, who
are on the cusp of becoming impact players in the NHL but are still
trying to gain an edge by working out in the off-season. Though it
requires quite a bit of sacrifice from the players, Doig said the
results are well worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally believe that at this point of my career, I have a
lot to prove,'' Doig said. ``I'm going to sacrifice my time, and
I'm willing to do it because of how much it helps me.''
</P>
<P>
   As more players go out on their own during the off-season and
discover what their efforts produce, more and more teams may
consider instituting these kinds of programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to win Stanley Cups, yeah, they will,'' Tocchet
said. ``The teams that are quicker getting to these programs are
going to win Stanley Cups.'' &QL;

BRITISH OPEN IS TOUGHEST TEST IN GOLF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Southport, England - Mark O'Meara claims a golf ball doesn't
know how old you are. ``It just sits there,'' stupidly, the
41-year-old Masters champion implies, ``waiting to be struck.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for any other object designed to be hit,
pitched, punted, dribbled, served.
</P>
<P>
   But a golf ball is perceptive, and intelligent for its size.
Studies that measure brain waves show that a golf ball is smarter
than a football or a tennis ball and far brighter than a badminton
birdie. Besides a high IQ, a golf ball is born with an adventurous
spirit and the willfulness of a headstrong child.
</P>
<P>
   A dimpled ball has a mind of its own. It oftentimes will do
whatever it wishes, on a whim, especially at the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's over there?'' a Titleist will wonder, curious as a
tourist.
</P>
<P>
   And off it will go, climbing toward the oyster-gray clouds,
riding a 40-mph crosswind. The player to whom the ball belongs can
quit and walk off the course _ in frustration, some do _ or grimly
follow after it, raindrops dripping off his tweed cap as he
marches, head down, collar upturned, across the moonscape that is
Royal Birkdale, the links course on the northwest coast of England,
home of this year's championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost six balls in nine holes,'' Tom Lehman, the 1996 British
Open champion, said after a practice round. U.S. Open champion Lee
Janzen commiserated. ``I think I lost five.''
</P>
<P>
   The British Open is the toughest test in golf, and more fun to
watch than any other tournament. This is the one time each year
when everything bad that can happen in golf happens to the game's
best shotmakers, instead of to you and me. &QL; 
Take my irons, please &QL; 
The last time the Open was played here, Mark Calcavecchia shot
9-over par on the front nine. After his round of 79, he presented
his irons to a stranger in the gallery. Gave them away.
</P>
<P>
   Why, Mark?
</P>
<P>
   ``Cause I hate 'em,'' Calcavecchia fumed.
</P>
<P>
   At the British Open more than golf balls disappear. During a
weekend round years ago, television's Jim McKay told American
viewers: ``Let's go out to the 12th hole and Ed Sneed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sneed, a golfer who had missed the 36-hole cut, was working for
the network as a roving reporter, which required he speak in a
whisper and wear an antenna on his head.
</P>
<P>
   But when McKay gave Sneed his cue, Ed didn't answer.
</P>
<P>
   McKay tried again to contact his colleague. Again, no luck.
Later Jack Whitaker gave it a shot. ``Ed Sneed, are you out there?
. . . Ed? . . . Hello, Ed?''
</P>
<P>
   Watching at home, I remember thinking the glitch had to be some
minor problem. Crossed wires. A pulled plug. But after this went on
awhile _ McKay kept calling Sneed in the persistent tone of a tower
operator, trying to radio a pilot whose plane had disappeared from
the radar screen, ``Come in. Come in. Do you read me?'' _ the
growing silence became unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   Where ``was'' Sneed? Like other pros, Ed knew his way around the
PGA Tour. But this wasn't Hilton Head, or the Phoenix Open. It was
Turnberry. Or Troon.
</P>
<P>
   Had Ed tumbled into a pot bunker? Maybe a gust swept him over
the edge of a rocky cliff and into the Firth of Fourth, or the
Fourth of Firth.
</P>
<P>
   Sneed eventually turned up at the clubhouse, safe and sound, but
his lengthy absence provided a subplot of mystery to the telecast
and underscored the curious nature of this tournament. &QL; 
Europeans are due &QL; 
The British Open is as unpredictable as the weather. At this
moment, the sun is out. No, wait, it's raining, again. The
temperature is in the low 50s, the wind off the Irish Sea blowing
long cold notes across the forbidding terrain.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara is a good choice. So is David Duval. But the Europeans
are due. I'll take Colin Montgomerie. He is loved here, and he's
playing well. His ball was unavailable for comment. &QL;

RATTLERS STRUGGLE FOR BIG FINISH  
 WHITE WANTS TO SEE MORE HEART ON FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The injured-reserve list has become nearly the size of the
roster. Hunkie Cooper is the 12th player to go on it.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the guys who are healthy, who aren't giving their all
on every play, that concern Rattlers Coach Danny White as arena
league playoffs loom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough has been said about the injuries,'' he said. ``It's
time to stop pretending to be champions and start playing like
champions.''
</P>
<P>
   The defending-champion Rattlers (8-3) looked more like an
expansion team Monday in losing to the host Albany Firebirds,
58-34.
</P>
<P>
   The Rattlers had 11 days to prepare. They came to Albany a day
early to get ready. But they fell flat to a team that had lost
three in a row. They didn't win a quarter, lost three more players
to injuries and didn't put up much of a fight in the end.
</P>
<P>
   White will see how resilient his Rattlers are tonight at America
West Arena, where they play the New York CityHawks (2-9) with only
two days to prepare. The CityHawks, led by quarterback Mike Perez
and offensive specialist Khevin Pratt, have lost seven in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game of leadership,'' White said. ``Either positive
leadership takes over or negative leadership takes over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against Albany, our negative leadership took over. We had a
couple of guys not playing very hard, and by the end of the game,
everybody was not playing very hard. You have to have enough out
there setting a positive pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Just having enough bodies to form a team has been difficult
enough.
</P>
<P>
   White has had to turn linemen Tony Henderson and Flint Fleming
into fullbacks because four players have been injured in that
position.
</P>
<P>
   Jet lag after the quick turnaround won't help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we're physically tired,'' White said. ``We're not
prepared to play this game. We have to get a lot of rest. We have
to get treatment, do the best we can with the bodies we've got.
This is a test of mental toughness, of will. What's going to
dominate, our minds or our bodies? If we give into what our bodies
are telling us, we won't play a very good game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rattlers still control their destiny. They need to win their
last three games to guarantee the second seed. Tampa Bay (10-1),
which lost to the Rattlers in last year's semifinals, appears to be
uncatchable as the top seed.
</P>
<P>
   Other than quarterback Sherdrick Bonner and offensive specialist
Calvin Schexnayder, the Rattlers' offense is hurting. Cooper, a
receiver/linebacker/return specialist, suffered a sprained
medial-collateral ligament in his left knee Monday and will be out
possibly four weeks. Lineman Joe Burch suffered a shoulder injury,
and reserve receiver Cedric Tillman suffered a pulled hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunkie is the spiritual leader of the team, and that's a huge
loss for us,'' Bonner said. ``But we have very capable players. We
have to look to someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Cooper and receiver Randy Gatewood (shoulder), and only
Brian Easter at fullback, the Rattlers are left with few options
other than trying to find more creative ways for Bonner to get the
ball to Schexnayder.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four of Bonner's 55 touchdown passes have gone to
Schexnayder. The CityHawks likely will double-team Schexnayder and
hope Shawn Parnell, Marvin Bagley and Herb Duncan don't beat them.
</P>
<P>
   White brought in lineman Oscar Sturgis, a 6-foot-5, 280-pound
import from the Canadian Football League, last week, and he will
make his debut tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in and started throwing people around in practice,''
White said. ``He'll dress as our seventh lineman.''
</P>
<P>
   White still has faith in his depleted team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think we're one of the best teams,'' he said. ``We
just have to prove it.'' &QL;

   PHOENIX - The Arizona State men's basketball team will battle
Nevada-Las Vegas for just the second time ever as part of a
doubleheader at America West Arena on Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona plays Wyoming in the other game. Times have not been
set, but ASU-UNLV likely will be the first game and start early in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The teams met once before, during the NCAA Tournament in 1975.
ASU won, 84-81.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the proximity of the two schools, it's amazing when you
look in the record book and see they've played only once in
history,'' said ASU Sports Information Director Mark Brand, who
works on the scheduling. ``Maybe we can start something here.''
</P>
<P>
   UNLV basketball declined in the wake of former head coach Jerry
Tarkanian's conflicts with the NCAA, his subsequent departure and
Rollie Massimino's brief but unhappy tenure. But the program has
enjoyed a resurgence under the current head coach, Bill Bayno.
</P>
<P>
   The Runnin' Rebels went 20-13 last season and earned an
automatic NCAA Tournament berth by winning the Western Athletic
Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ASU went 18-14 last season under former Coach Don Newman. Rob
Evans will coach the team this season.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Sun Devils' schedule is expected to be announced
in a few days. &QL;

CARSON, COLISEUM REPS EXCHANGE HEAD SLAPS OVER NFL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles' desperate attempt to secure an NFL franchise and
build a football stadium is now being waged between two combatants
that view each other with total disdain.
</P>
<P>
   On the one side, you have L.A. politician Mark Ridley-Thomas,
Los Angeles Kings and Staples Center co-owner Ed Roski and Roski
business associate John Semcken making passionate pitches for a new
stadium to be erected within the ancient walls of the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, you have legendary movie talent agency mogul
Michael Ovitz putting his considerable influence behind a plan to
build a state-of-the-art stadium in Carson.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties will tell you with persuasive charm that the other
is destined to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Who to believe?
</P>
<P>
   In an interview I had a week ago with John Semcken, he insisted
an NFL franchise one day would wind up playing at the Coliseum and
that there was no chance that a football stadium ever would be
constructed in Carson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just pure fantasy that Michael Ovtiz ever will be able
to stick a stadium on landfill in Carson that is nothing more than
a toxic waste dump,'' said Semcken, Roski's point man in rebuilding
the Coliseum and getting an NFL franchise for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview I had last Monday with Michael Ovitz, he
snickered at Semcken's claim and pulled out large color prototypes
designed by David Rockwell that showed what the future stadium of
Carson and its accompanying shopping mall would look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is that things in Carson are going along just as
planned,'' said a man who has represented some of the biggest names
in the entertainment field. ``By the year 2002, Southern California
is going to have a modern new stadium and an expansion team ready
to play in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Who to believe?
</P>
<P>
   Both John Semcken and Michael Ovitz are quite convincing in
extolling the virtues of their own projects while ridiculing the
prospects of each other's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next NFL team in L.A. will play at the Coliseum,''
maintains Semcken, an engaging Naval Academy graduate and former
F-14 fighter pilot who served as a technical adviser on ``Top
Gun.'' ``There's just no other place to play. Hollywood Park is a
dead issue. And so is Carson, despite what Michael Ovitz says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the pictures they're showing of the Carson stadium
are quite impressive. But that's just sizzle. I just can't envision
them ever getting a favorable environmental report on that toxic
waste dump.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're close to signing a 50-year lease that would give our
company, New Coliseum Venture, total control over the Coliseum,
without interference from the Coliseum Commission. We're going to
completely tear down the Coliseum, but leave the outer walls and
peristyle end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coliseum will be a completely new stadium, but will still
retain the old-style appearance. We've got the necessary investors.
USC has agreed to give us an extra 10,000 parking spaces. The
entire stadium project figures to run in the $300 million range.
The Coliseum is the only place that makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't to Michael Ovitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL will never give its OK to play at the Coliseum
again,'' asserts Ovitz. ``I've been told that by more than one
owner, and there is just no way the Coliseum people would be able
to get the necessary 24 votes from the owners that are needed. They
just don't want to put a team in the area that has poor parking and
not very good freeway access.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're planning to have 12 off and on ramps around the Carson
stadium with a new overpass set to be built. The projected price of
the stadium will be $350 million, and we have people like Gary
Wilson, chairman of Northwest Airlines, Ron Burkle, who owns
hundreds of supermarkets, Tom Cruise, Kevin Costner and Magic
Johnson and others set to invest in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to build this stadium, mark my word. We've been
planning to build a mall on the property for a long time, and all
the environmental reports on the property are intact. And I'm sure
there will be no problem getting the environmental agency's OK once
we get the go-ahead from the NFL, which we expect to get sometime
this fall when the owners meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, John Semcken takes issue with Ovitz about the NFL's
reported coolness toward the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of that negative talk you hear about the Coliseum from
NFL owners is gamemanship calculated to drive up the price of the
expansion fees,'' says Semcken. ``When the league's expansion
committee realizes what we're planning to do, I'm confident that
there'll be a more positive attitude among NFL owners about the
Coliseum.''
</P>
<P>
   No way, contends Michael Ovitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL never will stick a team again at the Coliseum,''
reiterates Ovitz. ``Look, I'm not going to get into a war of words
with the Coliseum people. I'm just convinced that the best way for
the NFL to come back to L.A. is through Carson. I'm sure when Mark
Ridley-Thomas and his friends realize this is the only way to go
that they'll start supporting us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the city of Carson is 100 percent behind us. It's going
to be a wonderful stadium that will seat 67,000 and will have the
facade of a California mission. It's going to be a spectacular
sight that will be visible for people driving on the San Diego and
Harbor Freeways. It's going to be the best football stadium ever
built, and there will be parking for 30,000 cars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Carson will never happen,'' insists John Semcken, loyal
Coliseum backer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Carson stadium will be a jewel every one of us in Southern
California will be proud of,'' says Michael Ovitz, loyal Carson
backer.
</P>
<P>
   Who to believe?
</P>
<P>
   Only time will expose what side is headed in the right
direction.

COYOTES' TRAIN ING METHODS BLASTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ZUCKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Coyotes lost 473 player-games to injuries last season, among
the highest in the NHL. According to the founder of Pro Camp, an
off-season training program several Coyotes players participate in,
that number could be reduced if the team were to revise its own
training procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a joke what the Coyotes have over there,'' said T.R.
Goodman, who works with Coyotes Rick Tocchet, Jeremy Roenick, Oleg
Tverdovsky and Jim Cummins, among others, at Pro Camp. ``I know the
stuff we're doing here is definitely going to make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's main problem, Goodman said, is a lack of
communication between different parties, such as the team training
staff, strength coaches, doctors and surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at what's going on, you never have the right
hand talking with the left hand,'' he said. ``The communication
ceases to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet, who began seeing Goodman four years ago when he was
suffering from back problems and says he now feels ``three or four
years younger,'' says the problem is not necessarily with the
Coyotes, but is leaguewide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think NHL teams are four or five years behind on
this stuff,'' Tocchet said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes do offer both in-season and off-season training for
their players, including a four-week summer session in Minnesota
with a personal trainer, and rookie training camps before the
preseason begins. Last February, the team opened a $29 million
training facility in Scottsdale to help players get ice time and
off-ice training year-round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, they would simply get dressed and leave,'' said Mike
O'Hearn, president of BG Ice, which operates the new facility.
``(With the new facility) the encouragement doesn't have to be such
an issue for them because the equipment is right there for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, you're finding players realize that the game
has become a 12-month-a-year deal. It's far too competitive, the
money on the table is too much and the competition is too great to
ignore anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some players say programs such as Pro Camp, which is
designed to cater toward the individual, has more impact than
team-sponsored programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Pro Camp) is definitely more personal,'' said Coyotes
defenseman Jason Doig. ``In the team sessions, you'll have 20 guys
out there all doing the same thing.''  &QL;

SUIT SOILS REPUTATION OF SCHOOL, BACKERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The son of legendary Notre Dame Coach Frank Leahy says
legions of Fighting Irish haters are enjoying seeing the school go
public with its ``dirty laundry.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Notre Dame Coach Dan Devine thinks the football program's
soiled reputation is something it is going to have to live with.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals linebacker Lyron Cobbins, who played for the Fighting
Irish from 1994-97, just wishes former Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz
wouldn't have had his character and mental stability questioned in
the trial that was completed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The school was found guilty of age discrimination for firing
former offensive line coach Joe Moore, who was 64 at the time.
Moore filed a lawsuit seeking $1 million but was awarded only
$84,000.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Notre Dame Coach Bob Davie, Holtz's successor
and former defensive coordinator, questioned whether Holtz was
having mental problems.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was accused of punching players, parking his car on the
practice field, smoking during workouts and taking three-hour
lunches.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the testimony was bizarre. Former Notre Dame offensive
lineman Chris Clevenger told of players watching school
cheerleaders have oral sex at the team hotel in Ireland. Clevenger
also acknowledged that the school's recruiting coordinator drank
alcohol at a party in which some underaged Irish players also were
drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole affair is an embarrassment to the school and
everyone who is associated with Notre Dame football,'' said Jim
Leahy, the son of Frank Leahy and father of former Cardinals
offensive lineman Ryan Leahy, who played for the Fighting Irish
from 1993-96.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our dirty laundry is out of the closet, and we're hanging it
in public. There are a lot of Notre Dame haters who are going to
love this.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leahy, who played offensive line for Notre Dame from
1966-68, questioned whether the team, 7-6 last year, can have a
good 1998 season with ``all of the family squabbling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dysfunctional family, too,'' said Leahy of the Fighting
Irish, which plays at Arizona State on Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Devine, the former Arizona State coach who directed the Fighting
Irish from 1975-80, thinks Davie needs to have a successful season
for the program to overcome its highly publicized problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning fixes anything,'' Devine said.
</P>
<P>
   Cobbins, like Holtz, said he is ``mystified'' by Davie's
comments questioning the former coach's mental stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davie would come into our meeting and say, `That little guy
(Holtz) is phenomenal, the things he knows.' '' Cobbins said from
his home in Kansas City, Kan. ``(Davie) would compliment Coach
Holtz every day. So, it's like this is coming out of nowhere. I
guess that's what a position of power will do to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this is because they brought in Bob Davie. Everything
was peaches and cream until they brought him in. I think they'll
get Bob Davie (fired) out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said Moore was hard-nosed but doesn't know of him
physically abusing players.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Leahy was on his way to Green Bay Packers camp and
unavailable for comment. &QL;

MORE TROUT AT LEES FERRY  
 BUT FISH ARE SMALLER, WEIGH LESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEES FERRY, Ariz. - It's an eerie trip up the Colorado River
toward Glen Canyon Dam.
</P>
<P>
   The deck boat was launched about 15 miles below the dam in
darkness. The river moves swiftly. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation
releases a large quantity of water as it tries to rid Lake Powell
of excesses from runoff of a huge snowpack in the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Janisch, head of fisheries for the Arizona Game and Fish
Department, runs the boat. He has experience, which is needed here.
The river takes a serpentine route through Marble Canyon. It takes
knowledge to miss the rocks and riffles between the massive cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   This 15-mile stretch of water is known as Lees Ferry, named for
a historic Mormon river crossing. It also is among the best
tailwater (below a dam) trout fisheries anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Around four miles upstream, the scene is even more bizarre.
Bright lights can be seen on the water, creating a surreal
atmosphere. The source of the lights is a generator on a shocking
boat. The boat sends electrical current into the water, stunning
trout, which are netted, measured, weighed and injected with
computer chips that allowed them to be identified when they're
netted again.
</P>
<P>
   Results are unbelievable. Each shock brings up more trout. That
night, the crew will cover four stretches of the Ferry. The crew
won't return to Marble Canyon Lodge until about 4 a.m. This litany
will be repeated three straight nights as Game and Fish continues
its intensive research on the trout at Lees Ferry.
</P>
<P>
   Any fishery potentially this good is bound to be controversial.
Everyone wants it. Lees Ferry has been a roller coaster of a
fishery since the gates at Glen Canyon Dam closed in 1963 and Game
and Fish stocked it with trout.
</P>
<P>
   At first, according to Janisch, the trout grew huge because of
food available from the lake and from fish already in the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lake had a huge population of shad then,'' Janisch said.
``They came through the (power generating) turbines into the river.
There also was a large population of fish in the river itself. The
trout just gorged themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Trout of 14 pounds or larger were taken from the lake for a
period of time. But the original source of food began to run dry,
and Game and Fish introduced a tiny freshwater shrimp, the
gammarus, in 1968. Within three years, the shrimp were found in the
stomach of trout. Since then, a small insect also has taken up
residence in the frigid water released from the bowels of Lake
Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Irregular releases of water caused the fishery to rise and fall.
Because of drastically fluctuating flows, the fishery crashed
completely from 1991 through 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, flows were established that considered more than power
generation and delivery of water to downstream users. The new
management created by the Glen Canyon Protection Act of 1992 also
considered the health of the Colorado River below the dam,
especially on its run through the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Game and Fish stocked as many as 150,000 trout a year over the
years but dropped that figure to 20,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that natural reproduction increased from about 25
percent of the trout population in 1986 to about 90 percent now.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the growth rate also has slowed,'' Janisch said. ``In
1989, a 4-year-old fish was about 18 inches long. Now the same fish
is about 14 inches.''
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, is because there are too many trout at Lees
Ferry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many more fish and not enough more food,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons is the management of the Ferry. It's a
blue-ribbon fishery now, with a bag limit of two trout. Fish
between 16 and 22 inches are protected. Flies and lures, with
barbless hooks only, are the only legal method of fishing for
trout.
</P>
<P>
   Lees Ferry also has become dominated by purists. Janisch said
that creel surveys indicate that only about 5,000 trout a year are
being killed. The population continues to grow. The user-days have
decreased greatly since the Ferry was open to all kinds of fishing,
according to studies.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said, small shrimp and insects require more work to eat
than forage fish and the like. Fish grow old and die before they
can attain the huge size they once did.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who would like the Ferry to be a completely
catch-and-release fishery, such as the San Juan in New Mexico.
Janisch said that isn't possible. The San Juan has little natural
reproduction, allowing biologists to control populations with
stocking. That's no longer possible at Lees Ferry, Janisch said.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been enough angler requests for a new management
plan that the Arizona Game and Fish Commission will consider
changing it at the October fisheries meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Four alternatives are listed in a new study. The department's
recommendation is that there be no change until more studies can be
done. Other recommendations include dividing the river into no-kill
and harvest areas, increasing the harvest of smaller fish, and
making the whole stretch no-kill only.
</P>
<P>
   Janisch said a number of anglers also have asked that some
stretch of the river also be opened to bait fishing again. That is
not a listed option but could be considered by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Walsh, a member of Trout Unlimited's state council, said
the state already has enough bait waters. A trout almost always is
killed when it eats bait.
</P>
<P>
   Five public meetings for input on the four proposals are
scheduled next week. All begin at 7 p.m. The first is Tuesday in
Flagstaff at Game and Fish's regional office, 3500 S. Lake Mary
Road.
</P>
<P>
   There are two on Wednesday, one in Page at the National Park
Service office on U.S. 89, the other in Phoenix at Game and Fish's
home office, 2221 W. Greenway Road.
</P>
<P>
   On Thurday, meetings will be held at Marble Canyon Lodge near
Lees Ferry, and in Tucson at the University of Arizona cooperative
county office, 4210 N. Campbell Ave. &QL;

GARY HALL TESTED POSITIVE AT ATLANTA GAMES, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Phoenix Swim Club sprinter Gary Hall Jr., currently
under provisional suspension from competition, was told by U.S.
Swimming in 1996 that he could not march in closing ceremonies of
the Atlanta Olympics because of a positive test for marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sanctioned Gary there by not allowing him to participate
in the closing ceremonies,'' his father, Dr. Gary Hall, said
Wednesday. ``They sent him home, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall still was in Hawaii on Wednesday as he awaited results of a
second test of a twin sample taken on May 15, when swimming's
international governing body, FINA, reported that the Olympic
gold-and-silver medalist tested positive for marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The test of the so-called B sample was scheduled for Wednesday
at an International Olympic Committee lab in Montreal. It was not
known how or when FINA would announce the result from its
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   If the second test is positive, there is controversy over
whether Hall would be subject to a suspension of three months to
two years. That would be determined at a hearing before FINA's
doping panel. Hall has withdrawn from the Goodwill Games, scheduled
to begin Sunday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gunnar Werner, an honorary secretary for FINA, was quoted last
week as saying Hall would be considered a two-time offender because
of the 1996 test.
</P>
<P>
   Werner said Hall was sent a letter of warning. Hall's father
confirmed Wednesday that he has a copy of that letter.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not clear whether marijuana was a banned substance at
the 1996 Olympics. Werner said the substance was added to the
banned list on July 17, just before the start of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hall Sr., FINA Vice President Ross Wales has said
the 1996 test could not be viewed as an offense because marijuana
was not subject to sanctions until mid-September, or about six
weeks after the closing ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   A marijuana test in Atlanta also did not call for any of the
standard procedures such as testing for a B sample, according to
Wales.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, nobody I knew with U.S. Swimming or at the IOC
level had made any indication that it had been added to the list,''
said the senior Hall, a three-time Olympian who carried the
American flag at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal. &QL;

AGENT CAN'T SEE BULLS OFFERING JOB TO SKILES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Chicago Bulls conducted a formal interview with
Suns assistant coach Scott Skiles six days ago, but Skiles' agent
said he would be surprised if his client was hired to succeed Phil
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal feeling from the first day has been that we're not
getting this job,'' Keith Glass said Wednesday. ``We didn't ask for
the job. We haven't applied for the job. As of right now, we
haven't applied. Scott has a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Skiles, 34, met Saturday for three hours with Bulls owner Jerry
Reinsdorf and General Manager Jerry Krause.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, neither Reinsdorf nor Krause gave any indication
as to when a decision would be made, according to Glass. There had
been media speculation that an announcement would be made today.
Skiles was on vacation in the Midwest and was unavailable for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf said Wednesday on ESPN's ``Up Close'' that the Bulls
new head coach would be announced ``within the next week or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf confirmed that he had talked to Michael Jordan about
the coaching vacancy before July 1, start of the NBA's ongoing
lockout. He said he mentioned names of possible candidates to
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be foolish to hire somebody without feeling confident
this is somebody that Michael could play for,'' Reinsdorf said.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles has been reported to be one of at least five candidates.
Iowa State Coach Tim Floyd, a friend of Krause's, is considered the
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The other three are NBA assistants Rick Carlisle of Indiana, Ron
Rothstein of Cleveland and Charlotte's Paul Silas, a former Suns
assistant and player. There have been conflicting reports about
whether former Dallas Mavericks guard Brad Davis is a sixth
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Skiles also is being mentioned as a possibility for
the NBA's two other head-coaching jobs: the Denver Nuggets and Los
Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's flattering, very flattering for a guy his age,'' Glass
said of Skiles, who was hired to assist Suns Coach Danny Ainge last
summer after coaching for a season in Greece. ``Obviously, somebody
knows Scott can coach other than me, him and Danny Ainge. That's
all nice stuff. I just hope people there (Phoenix) understand that
Scott is not out beating the bushes for a job. He's happy in
Phoenix.'' &QL;

D-BACKS COME BACK  
 KLASSEN'S 2-OUT HIT IN 11TH SAVES DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In a season chock-full of firsts _ many of them
painful _ the Diamondbacks finally registered two huge ones in a
9-8, 11-inning victory over the Central Division-leading Houston
Astros Wednesday night that left them relieved.
</P>
<P>
   After going 0 for 54 in games when they trailed after eight
innings, they finally kicked the monkey off their back, thanks to
rookie Danny Klassen's two-out, two-strike shot into the
right-center field gap off Astros reliever Mike Magnante that
scored Kelly Stinnett from second.
</P>
<P>
   More important, for the first time in their brief 94-game
history, they finally not only won a three-game series against a
team playing above .500, but they also beat the National League
Central Division leader.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't easy, and more so for Houston's ace reliever Billy
Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, after allowing a leadoff single to Matt Williams while
protecting an 8-7 lead in the ninth inning, was struck in the head
by a vicious line drive off the bat of Diamondbacks catcher
Stinnett and left the game on a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   His vital signs were good and he never lost consciousness, but
he was taken a neurological center for more tests.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks managed to send the game into extra innings
when pinch-hitter Karim Garcia greeted reliever Jay Powell with a
double off the glove of second baseman Craig Biggio and scored
Williams. Powell escaped further damage by whiffing pinch-hitter
Jorge Fabregas with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks starter Andy Benes, winless in his last four
outings, cruised through the first five innings protecting a
six-run lead and seemed to be out of the sixth when Williams booted
Carl Everett's two-out grounder to third with runners at the
corners.
</P>
<P>
   Williams can be blamed for prolonging the inning, but what
followed was the product of Benes, who allowed all five unearned
runs. When the inning finally ended, Benes was showering and the
Astros closed the gap to 7-6 behind three more singles and a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Houston tied the game at 7 in seventh on Moises Alou's towering
homer to left off reliever Clint Sodowsky, then scored in the
eighth behind a leadoff double by Brad Asmus, who went to third on
Sean Berry's deep fly to right center and scored on Craig Biggio
slow roller to short.
</P>
<P>
   All looked rosy when rookie superstar Travis Lee clubbed his
19th homer of the season in the fourth. It marked the 100th of the
season for the Diamondbacks, Lee's 100th hit and 50th RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks gave Benes the kind of lead he has only dreamed
about with this expansion team, sending 11 men to the plate against
Astros starter Mike Hampton in a five-run second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Yamil Benitez stroked a one-out single to left, then scored on
David Dellucci's double into the gap in left-center. Dellucci's
two-bagger was significant in that it kept alive the Diamondback's
major league-leading streak of 81 consecutive games with an
extra-base hit.
</P>
<P>
   But shortstop Jay Bell soon rendered the double moot by stroking
a 384-foot three-run homer into the left-field seats after Devon
White drove in a run with a bases-loaded fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Benes helped keep the rally alive and loaded the bases for White
by beating out a perfect two-strike bunt after whiffing on two
previous attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton was lit up for six runs and 10 hits in a 7-4 loss to the
Diamondbacks in Houston on July 4, but it was his first start since
coming of the 15-day disabled list because of a groin pull.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason on Wednesday, Astros Manager Larry Dierker
offered him up as so much snake fodder. Not only did Hampton remain
in the game, but after a scoreless third he was thoroughly hammered
as the Diamondbacks took a 7-1 lead with back-to-back homers by Lee
and catcher Kelly Stinnett.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the seventh time this year the Diamondbacks have had
consecutive homers.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who entered the game with an 8-4 record and a solid
3.04 ERA, was mercifully removed for a pinch-hitter to lead off the
fifth, but not before allowing seven earned runs, seven hits, three
homers, a double and a hit batsman in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different story for Benes, who allowed only one run
through the first five innings after wriggling out of possible
trouble spots in the first two innings.
</P>
<P>
   He escaped the first inning by inducing Astros cleanup hitter
Jeff Bagwell to ground into an inning-ending double play with
runners at the corners, and he stranded Ricky Gutierrez at second
in the second. The Astros finally dented him in the fourth, when
Alou scored on an infield out after tripling.

EXPANDED ROTATION HAS EXTENDED CAREERS OF MANY STARTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every so often, a fan of baseball's glorious past will rise and
ask, ``Why doesn't anyone use a four-man rotation anymore?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a fair question, especially considering how well minds
preserve the memories of the now-deceased four-man rotation. Just
about everyone who was a fan in the 1950s and '60s can recall the
names of the great pitchers of that era.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers such as Bob Gibson, Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale, Juan
Marichal, Whitey Ford, Warren Spahn and Johnny Sain, Dave McNally
and Jim Kaat routinely started 40 games a year and generally
provided many more 20-game winners for that reason.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the game has always evolved, the four-man rotation
stopped being used in the early 1970s when the Baltimore Orioles
and Los Angeles Dodgers finally succumbed and went to the
now-popular five-man rotation.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest reasons cited for the decline of the four-man
rotation was the weakening of quality arms available. It's a theory
that several pitchers who threw in a four-man rotation believe to
be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lost art,'' said Cincinnati pitching coach Don Gullett,
who started his career in a four-man rotation. ``A four-man staff
is more symmetrical: You pitch, you're off, you have your throw
day, you're off and then you pitch again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I threw in a four-man, I didn't feel the extra zip on my
fastball, but I did have more movement on my pitches because I
wasn't as strong. Pitching is all about movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Gullett's thoughts are shared by many pitchers who played the
game before 1970, considered the general cutoff of the four-man
staff. Probably the primary reason the four-man staff died was the
inability of the human arm to rebound quickly enough to pitch in
four days' time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem is you can't find four guys who can hold
up,'' said St. Louis pitching coach Dave Duncan, considered one of
the best at his profession. ``Back in the 1950s there were only
eight teams in each league and there were all those minor leagues
stocked with more pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a starter went down, you simply pulled another one out of
the pool. The quality was much greater because there were fewer
big-league clubs. The Mike Garcias, Bob Lemons, Bob Gibsons and Don
Drysdales _ physically, those guys were freaks because they
survived.''
</P>
<P>
   A current major league manager, who requested anonymity because
he did not want to offend anyone, said, ``It's true. For every one
of the pitchers we remember, there were three or four who would get
injured and never surface again. Anyone who says that was the
golden age of pitching doesn't have a good memory. Guys were
getting hurt all the time back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Earl Weaver's Orioles of the early 1970s were one of the
last to hold out on the four-man staff. Of course, those Orioles
had four quality arms in Jim Palmer, Dave McNally, Mike Cuellar and
Pat Dobson.
</P>
<P>
   The 1971 Orioles will probably forever be the answer to a trivia
question: What was the last club to have four 20-game winners on
the same staff?
</P>
<P>
   It's a feat that is unlikely to ever happen again because
starters now receive about 32 starts per season instead of the 40
those pitchers routinely got each year.
</P>
<P>
   Durability was the biggest problem with the majority of the
starters back then. Even when they took the ball every four days,
the damage several pitchers were causing their arms tended to be
irreparable.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Denny McLain, who in 1968 was the game's last 30-game
winner, received at least eight cortisone injections in his right
shoulder during the Tigers' pennant-winning season that year.
</P>
<P>
   An ailing pitcher will usually receive a maximum of two
cortisone injections over a full year nowadays. But McLain,
possibly unaware of the long-term damage and partly with an eye on
winning 30 games, passed on the notion of skipping a turn in the
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Within four years, at age 28, McLain was out of baseball. He
followed his 31-win season with 24 more victories in 1969 at age
25, but wound up with a combined 17-34 record in his final three
seasons in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys bit the dust that we never heard of,'' Duncan
said. ``In order to pitch in a four-game rotation, all the starters
would have to be able to pitch on three days' rest and stay
healthy. The extra day certainly helps, especially over the course
of a 162-game season.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of today's pitchers simply could not hold up over the
course of a long season in a four-man rotation, a fact several
readily admit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're out there seven innings every time out there over
the course of a season, it takes a toll,'' Diamondbacks pitcher
Willie Blair said. ``I think it would be tough to go out and throw
100 pitches every four days. Some might be able to do it. Me,
personally, I don't think I could. Over the course of a full
season, I think you'd see pitchers fall by the side.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the biggest motivation toward evolving into a five-man
staff. Of course, several of today's pitchers could hold up in a
four-man rotation. Roger Clemens, Greg Maddux and Curt Schilling
jump to the top of the list when such pitchers are mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   The list, however, is so short that no club could afford to
switch to a four-man rotation for an extended period, especially
considering none of today's starters are groomed for such a taxing
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the five-man was a blessing because I developed some
arm problems and couldn't make it on three days rest,'' said
Houston Manager Larry Dierker, a former 20-game winner during his
playing days. ``Now, my first three years, when my arm was strong,
I loved it. But I had to be realistic after my arm trouble. You
have to have good stuff and a very strong arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Several smart baseball people believe a four-man rotation can
still be employed. It would, they say, take strong dedication from
an organizational standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it can be done, but it's got to start no later than at
the Double-A level,'' said San Diego pitching coach Dave Stewart,
who had the type of physical ability to probably hold up in a
four-man staff. ``Then you run into trouble if you sign a free
agent who wouldn't want to do it. Overall, I'd say it's gone
forever.'' &QL;

TRADES MAKE FOR INTERESTING TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF CADE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With all the supposed trade rumors flying around, it comes down
to this: When you throw enough mud on the wall, some of it is bound
to stick.
</P>
<P>
   The number of free agents _ and the agendas that teams have on
whether to make a run for a playoff spot or sell off and rebuild _
makes predicting trades a crap shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Robin Ventura would look good in a Cubs uniform, or Kenny
Rogers back in a Rangers outfit. And imagine Dante Bichette with
the Red Sox. But you can drive yourself batty trying to anticipate
moves that'll only turn out wrong anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Each summer the biggest deals are the ones that come out of the
blue involving names no one is figuring on.
</P>
<P>
   It's bound to work that way again this summer. Just watch. &QL; 
Getting what they want &QL; 
In years past, actual baseball owners have been slow to realize
that free agency can work in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   Next year could be their year. With the large number of free
agents available, the law of supply and demand should take effect.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson, Mike Piazza, Mo Vaughn, Bichette, Ellis Burks,
Roberto Alomar, Kevin Brown, Todd Stottlemyer and Rafael Palmeiro
are simply the ones off the top of my head.
</P>
<P>
   Each player will want long-term, big-money contracts, but with
fewer teams willing to spend the big money on players, that means
the supply of top talent will exceed the demand.
</P>
<P>
   Their prices will fall, or should. In short, Vaughn should sign
now. &QL; 
Box score-itis &QL; 
A magnifying glass truly helps when poring over the box scores for
the slightest movement in your favor.
</P>
<P>
   If you are in contention in your league, then the weeks before
the trade deadline are times that will try your soul.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: The Blue Jays score 15 runs in a win. You tear
apart the box scores, happily salivating as you look up the
rejuvenated Jose Canseco. And what do you find?
</P>
<P>
   He didn't play.
</P>
<P>
   Nooooo! (You'll probably utter something worse if this happens
to you.)
</P>
<P>
   Or, say your starting pitchers had a great day, only to discover
the Cleveland Indians decided not to overlook pitcher Jose Mesa,
and he gives up five runs in a third of an inning.
</P>
<P>
   And if your boat is leaking so quickly that you resort to
keeping Shawn Boskie or Doug Drabek aboard, then you know you are
in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   What the gracious fantasy team owner is looking for is poise.
You know there will be good times. You also know there will be bad
times and dry times and injuries _ you just want them to happen to
somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners, when their teams are doing badly, refuse to look at
the box scores, at least not in the morning. It only ruins their
day and disrupts the household.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking the cat, beating the dog and spilling the coffee: These
incidents are vastly on the rise this time of year. Of course,
knowing it's 95 degrees at 8 in the morning doesn't help, either.
</P>
<P>
   For the luckless contender, the imminent feeling of injury or
having a player traded out of the league may not haunt you, but
rather it's the slow, agonizing unraveling of what had been an
utterly perfect first half.
</P>
<P>
   Drifting into fifth place, and there's nothing you can do about
it. Let's hope this doesn't happen to you. &QL;

YANKS KNOW POSTSEASON IS KEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Yankees' runaway locomotive is hitting on all
cylinders. As each passing week demonstrates, there appears to be
absolutely no end in sight to what this Yankees juggernaut can
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing the first half with a 61-20 record, the Yankees
started the second half on a tear, winning five of their first six
games since the break. More importantly, the Yankees are the class
of Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta and San Diego may think they're close, but the Yankees'
bench separates them from everyone else. When Manager Joe Torre can
call on Chad Curtis, Tim Raines and Luis Sojo to fill in for his
starters, then it's almost not fair.
</P>
<P>
   These Yankees have even done something the famed 1927 Yankees,
generally considered the greatest club ever, never did. They won 57
of their first 81 games. The true test, of course, will be how the
1998 Yankees do in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Losing in the playoffs will erase everything these Yankees have
accomplished. But before New York meets Anaheim or Texas (which
would be the Yankees' first-round opponent right now) in the first
round of the playoffs, the Yankees have another 2{ months left to
chase 120 victories, which would be a 20th century record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be proud,'' said David Cone, who is one of three
Yankees' pitchers with at least 10 victories. ``It's a great start.
It's a great accomplishment to be named with the best teams of all
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees no longer are built around free agents. While
several of their stars are from other organizations, they were
acquired through trades. That includes Paul O'Neill, Chuck
Knoblauch and Scott Brosius. The other stars on the team _ Bernie
Williams, Derek Jeter, Andy Pettitte and Mariano Rivera _ are
home-grown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a team that is as focused as this one,''
Yankees boss George Steinbrenner said. &QL; 
What to do? &QL; 
Seattle's front office set an artificial deadline of July 14 for
making some kind of move in the American League West. In the week
since the All-Star break, the Mariners have managed to win four of
six games and sliced two games off their deficit in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are still uncertain of whether they're in the race.
In the meantime, Seattle's front office will continue to wrestle
with the notion of trading former Cy Young Award winner Randy
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles and Cleveland remain the most likely clubs to trade
for Johnson. The question now is whether the Mariners will pull the
trigger on a deal before the July 31 trading deadline. It is highly
unlikely that Johnson will clear waivers and be available to be
traded before Aug. 31, the final deadline to make deals and have
players eligible for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners Manager Lou Piniella said that if it were up to him,
he'd ``explore possibilities of a trade'' for Johnson. &QL; 
Rocky Road &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, which along with Baltimore is one of the two biggest
disappointments, is slipping farther behind National League
West-leading San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable has started to creep up in the Rocky Mountain
region: How long can the Rockies continue to founder? While that's
the question coming from Rockies fans, ownership seems intent on
keeping the management team of General Manager Bob Gebhart and
Manager Don Baylor together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the fans and media are frustrated,'' Colorado owner
Jerry McMorris said. ``I'm frustrated, too. But it is easier to
tear something down than to build it up. We have two good baseball
men who have been loyal to our ownership group. This is a time that
they have to have every opportunity to correct the performance of
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's difficult not to take note of the Rockies' poor home
record (20-29 as of Wednesday). Colorado had the best home record
each of the past two seasons.

<P>
   ``I don't lay awake worrying about losing my job,'' Baylor said.
``If that's going to come it is going to come. I worry about how to
play better that particular day. I try to be positive going into
each day that we're going to put a (winning) streak together.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is talking about the Blake Street Bombers right now.
Pitchers don't seem to come in here intimidated. What I'd like to
see is us get that feeling back that we're not out of any game
until it's over.'' &QL;

TUCSON'S RYAN EARNS RAVES WITH PLAY, ATTI TUDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone associated with the Diamondbacks is enamored of their
short, sturdy outfielder who hustles and dives for balls and plays
with energy and passion. But this isn't about David Dellucci. Not
entirely, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Tucson's Rob Ryan was named organizational Player of the Month
in June after batting .368 with seven home runs and 23 RBIs. Going
into Wednesday night's game, he was hitting .332 with 12 homers, 47
RBIs and an on-base percentage of .437.
</P>
<P>
   But what seems to draw the most raves about Ryan are his
attitude and work ethic. Manager Buck Showalter loves Ryan. So does
Mel Didier, director of player development.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tremendous worker,'' Didier said. ``He's built himself
up, he's strong. He reminds me a great deal of Dellucci. He plays
like him. He's hard-nosed. He's Buck's kind of guy. He's our kind
of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   A 26th-round pick out of Washington State in 1996, Ryan hit .303
for Lethbridge in 1996 and .314 for South Bend last year, when he
was named team Most Valuable Player. He set club records for
batting average, on-base percentage, doubles and walks.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan has continued along the same path with the Sidewinders.
When Danny Klassen, Tucson's only Triple-A All-Star, was called up,
Ryan went to the game in his place.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might have more power potential than Dellucci,'' Didier
said. ``He runs a shade better and throws a shade better. As far as
the overall game, Dellucci right now is probably playing it
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the comparison Didier favors with both Dellucci and
Ryan is the Texas Rangers' Rusty Greer, who quietly has become one
of the game's better outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   But because they are ``corner outfielders'' with somewhat
limited power, Didier said it might be difficult to play both at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very difficult,'' he said. ``You've got to have big corner
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, the center fielder can generate a lot of pop.
Devon White, who currently occupies center field, has 13 homers but
is not considered a power hitter. Plus, he's 35. But you never
know. Let's say White is traded, hypothetically speaking. Then the
Diamondbacks could sign a free-agent center fielder with power.
Someone like Bernie Williams, hypothetically speaking. &QL; 
Brief stints
</P>
<P>
   Another young pitcher has moved up to Tucson. Right-hander
Stephen Randolph joined the Sidewinders this week after going 4-4
with a 3.59 ERA and 104 strikeouts in 85 innings. In his last start
for High Desert, Randolph pitched seven scoreless innings against
Bakersfield and combined with Tim Grieve for the first one-hitter
in team history. Not to be outdone, the next day Brad Penny pitched
seven scoreless innings and struck out 13 in another High Desert
shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Tucson outfielder Brent Cookson's season might be over. He broke
his wrist while swinging the bat against Salt Lake on Monday.
Cookson, who singled on the play, apparently hurt himself on the
follow-through. It's been a tough year for Cookson, who missed 36
games because of a knee injury. He was batting .360 in 100
at-bats. &QL;

FAR-FLUNG GALAXIES GIVE CLUES TO EARLY STAGES OF UNIVERSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ Teams of astronomers in Hawaii and Japan have
detected hidden galaxies deep in space, a discovery that scientists
say will force major changes in prevailing theories about the early
chapters of the universe.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists who found the previously unknown ``starburst''
galaxies _ star-forming systems at least 11 billion light-years
from Earth _ said earlier conclusions about when galaxies were born
may have to be thrown out. Galaxy formation was thought to have
peaked when the universe _ believed to be 13 billion to 15 billion
years old _ was 8 billion to 10 billion years old. But this newly
observed burst of galaxy formation may have occurred much earlier _
perhaps when the universe was less than 2 billion years old.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the development appears in Thursday's issue of the
journal Nature. Similar conclusions were reported in the same
journal by researchers in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaii-Tokyo astronomers surveyed two seemingly blank
regions of sky with a special camera attached to the 15-meter James
Clerk Maxwell Telescope on the dormant Mauna Kea volcano.
</P>
<P>
   The new camera _ called SCUBA, for ``Submillimeter Common User
Bolometer Array'' _ measures energy emissions from cosmic dust
particles, smaller than a millimeter in size, which fall outside
the visual and infrared portions of the light spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the great distances involved, it takes billions of
light-years for the energy emitted by the newfound galaxies to
reach Earth. So when scientists view them with the new devices,
they are looking at a piece of the universe far back in time.
</P>
<P>
   Such feats in extending the so-called ``lookback'' times &UR;  &LR; were
not possible before the advent of the powerful new tools _ the use
of which could help unravel some of the primordial mysteries of how
and when the cosmos was created.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changes our view of how the universe evolved,'' said Amy
Barger, a member of the Hawaii team. ``In order to come up with a
comprehensive view of the universe, you have to know something
about all the major components that make it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Enveloped in cosmic dust, the newfound ``starburst'' galaxies
appear to be radiating the same amount of stellar energy as the
entire visible universe, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   That raises the possibility that regions of sky that appear to
be utter voids, even when viewed through the Hubble Space Telescope
or the most powerful earthbound instruments, in fact may be
swarming with billions of hot young stars and cosmic debris.
</P>
<P>
   ``The existence of such dust-enshrouded galaxies has been
proposed by various groups, and there has been some evidence for
them already,'' said Drew Phillips, a researcher at the Lick
Observatory at the University of California at Santa Cruz. ``It
sounds like these folks have established that a large number of
these galaxies actually do exist _ certainly a significant, albeit
not totally unexpected, discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ellis, director of the Institute of Astronomy at
Cambridge University in England, said the astronomical observations
``have opened an exciting new era in cosmological exploration
comparable to that which happened with the restoration of image
quality with the Hubble Space Telescope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Understanding this new population (of galaxies) is essential
in order to obtain a comprehensive picture of cosmic galaxy
formation,'' he said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   It took a record 51-hour exposure with the SCUBA cameras at
Mauna Kea to get the results reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It will take further study, however, to put the findings into
perspective _ and possibly unlock some fundamental questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until quite recently,'' Phillips noted, ``we have been limited
in our study of the early universe by how small and faint distant
galaxies appear.''

WITH SWISS BANK BOYCOTT, CALIFORNIA TREASURER JOINS NEW ACTIVISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT COLLIER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When California Treasurer Matt Fong announced a
state boycott of Swiss banks because of a legal fight over funds
stolen from Jews by the Nazis, it seemed like a politically adroit
overture to a powerful lobby. But it also gave him some unexpected
bedfellows _ and an unwanted controversy over economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Fong and officials from New York state and New York
City on July 1 renews a decision of a year ago to stop investing
billions of dollars of government funds in Swiss banks, in order to
help Holocaust victims' heirs recover family assets held by the
banks since World War II. The boycott had been suspended during
negotiations with the banks.
</P>
<P>
   Fong's decision to champion the issue could enable him to gain
backing from Jewish groups, which generally support his opponent in
the U.S. Senate race, incumbent Barbara Boxer, who herself is
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   But Fong's move also put him smack in the midst of an ungainly
mix of activists from the left and right. In recent years, state
and local governments, from the Bay Area to the South to the East
Coast, have enacted boycotts of corporations over a wide range of
issues: selling tobacco; tolerating exploitative working
conditions; making violent, sex-filled movies; and doing business
with pariah nations like Burma and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The human-rights activists, tobacco opponents and religious
conservatives to whom the politicians were responding agree on
little except that government boycotts can be a powerful tool _ and
they don't cost the taxpayers anything.
</P>
<P>
   Fong insists that he doesn't care for the types he finds himself
in company with, saying the Holocaust has nothing in common with
``social activist'' issues. However, lawmakers elsewhere gladly
claim him as a new ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``California's stand on Swiss banks shows how people and local
governments across the country are realizing they have a lot of
power and can use it to advance human rights,'' said Massachusetts
state Rep. Byron Rushing, a Democrat who wrote the legislation for
his state's 1996 boycott on Burma and its sanctions against South
Africa during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The new breed of economic activism uses two types of boycotts:
divestment, in which the state treasury or state pension funds sell
their investments (or simply refuse to buy more) in companies
involved in the undesired activity; and selective purchasing, in
which the state government refuses to purchase products made by the
target companies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1996, San Francisco barred investments in
companies that do business with Burma; this April, the Board of
Supervisors voted to divest tobacco company stocks owned by the
city's $9 billion pension fund; currently, the city attorney's
office is analyzing how to implement a resolution passed last year
by the supervisors urging the city to stop buying products made by
low-wage, ``sweatshop'' foreign labor.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the boycotts enjoy bipartisan backing, while in
others they are controversial. And in some, they may be treading on
thin legal ground.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the Swiss bank boycott stretches far beyond the
estimated 10,000 Holocaust survivors in California. But it was
influential Jewish groups in Southern California, such as the Simon
Wiesenthal Center, that pushed the issue, prompting Fong to
respond.
</P>
<P>
   Any payoff in votes or campaign donations would be welcome for
Fong, who faces an uphill battle against Boxer in November's
election.
</P>
<P>
   Fong says _ and many experts agree _ that California's $32
billion short-term investment fund has so much economic clout that
it may force the Swiss to settle rapidly. The fund bought a total
of $2.2billion in Swiss bank financial notes in the 16 months prior
to Fong's initial ban last July. Now, it holds none.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every morning, my office makes $600 million in new
investments, but now none of them are Swiss, so that's a pretty big
incentive for the banks,'' said Fong.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a similar standoff ended when the German
auto giant Volkswagen agreed to set up a fund to compensate workers
who were forced into slave labor during World War II. The firm's
move was an abrupt about-face from a decision announced only a
month earlier, and was interpreted by analysts as a sign that the
corporation's bosses feared a California-style boycott.
</P>
<P>
   However, other hot-button social issues get no sympathy from
Fong. He and the Wilson administration have strongly opposed
attempts in the Legislature to extend the boycott strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Fong has refused a request by Elected Officials for Responsible
Public Investment, a coalition of officials from 11 California
cities, to set social standards _ including a ban on tobacco
investments _ on the state's $12 billion Local Agency Investment
Fund, which acts as a short-term savings account for cities,
counties and special districts.
</P>
<P>
   Fong also fought legislative proposals to force the state's two
public pension funds, California Public Employee Retirement System
and the State Teachers Retirement System, to divest from tobacco
stocks and Hollywood film companies, and he opposed a bill to bar
the state from doing business with firms that operate in Burma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fong certainly seems to have a double standard,'' said Mark
Friedman, an El Cerrito councilman and co-chairman of Elected
Officials for Responsible Public Investment. ``He takes one stand
on Swiss banks, but he claims he can't act on tobacco or Burma. . .
. This is more about politics than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fong denies any link between the Swiss banks issue and the
coalition's demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holocaust was the greatest crime against humanity ever
committed, and there's no way to compare it with rap music or
cigarette smoking or other social issues that some people want us
to use'' as investment criteria, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over boycotts began in the 1980s, when 185 such
laws were enacted by state and local governments nationwide _
including California and most cities in the Bay Area _ to punish
white-ruled South Africa. The sanctions were widely credited in
helping undermine the apartheid system and bring democratic
elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   After a lull of several years in the early 1990s, sanctions
again became the rage by mid-decade. Florida, Pennsylvania and New
York City moved to divest from tobacco companies; Maryland
boycotted firms that do business in Nigeria; Texas announced Friday
that it will divest from Walt Disney Co. because of violence and
sex in its movies.
</P>
<P>
   But a backlash against the boycotts has started.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has criticized Fong's move, saying it runs
contrary to American foreign-policy goals of encouraging open
markets and free trade. Complaining of ``flagrant propaganda,'' the
Swiss government said the sanctions violate World Trade
Organization rules and threatened to file a complaint with the WTO
to force them to be overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Big business is not pleased, either. USAEngage,(CQ) a coalition
of 600 major corporations that opposes all trade sanctions, said
the California and New York boycotts are unconstitutional and
counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   The boycott strategy's overall fate may be decided in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union and Japan have threatened to file a complaint
against the state in the WTO, saying that its boycott of firms that
do business with Burma violates the WTO's rules on government
procurement.
</P>
<P>
   And the National Foreign Trade Council, an arm of USAEngage, is
suing in federal court, saying the state boycott violates the U.S.
Constitution's stipulation that foreign policy is in the federal
government's purview, not the states'.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts officials say the lawsuit has major implications
for states and cities nationwide, including California.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a definitive ruling on the federal
constitutionality of state sanctions,'' said Massachusetts
Assistant Attorney General Thomas Barnico, who directs his state's
defense at the WTO and in federal court. ``This case may set a
historical precedent in the 200-year-old debate over federalism.''

ON EVE OF ROMANOV RITES, CALIFORNIA RELATIVE REFLECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL TAYLOR  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INVERNESS, Calif. _ In the rural chumminess of western Marin
County, he is Andy Romanoff, the affable artist who lives in a
rambling old red-shingled house in Inverness.
</P>
<P>
   But when he walks into the Peter and Paul Cathedral in St.
Petersburg, Russia, tomorrow morning, he may well be greeted by an
usher who says, ``This way, Prince Andrew, the family is sitting
over here.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not well known, largely because Andrew Romanoff, 75, is
loath to bandy it about, but he is a member of the fabled dynasty
that ruled Russia for 300 years. He would be fourth in line to the
throne _ if the throne were still there.
</P>
<P>
   Friday he will join some 65 other dukes, grand dukes, duchesses,
princes and princesses who have flown in from around the world for
one of the more bizarre family funerals of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty years to the day after they were assassinated by the
Bolsheviks in the city of Yekaterinburg, Czar Nicholas II and his
wife, Empress Alexandra, along with three of their five children
and four servants, will be given as close to an honorable burial as
the fractious politics of current-day Russia can muster.
</P>
<P>
   The salute will be 19 instead of 21 guns, President Boris
Yeltsin will not attend and the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox
Church, Alexis II, has snubbed the whole thing. The patriarch
refuses to concede that, despite conclusive DNA testing, the bits
of bone that will be in those coffins actually belong to the czar
and his family.
</P>
<P>
   But for the rest of the Romanovs _ most of the world spells it
Romanov, though the official family association prefers Romanoff _
the burial will close an important chapter in the history of a
dynasty that was torn apart and scattered around the world after
the Russian Revolution of 1917.
</P>
<P>
   And the stories of what later happened to the exiled royals and
their court are just as interesting as the summary fate visited on
Nicholas and his brood.
</P>
<P>
   Some Romanovs ended up as investment counselors or bankers. Many
married other European royals. Others became cab drivers in Paris
or opened restaurants in the United States. One of the descendants,
Paul Ilyinsky, ended up as mayor of Palm Beach, Fla., and joked the
other day that he is ``probably the only Romanov ever elected by
the people in a democratic election.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience of Andrew Romanoff was a typical one.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother, the Grand Duchess Xenia, was the sister of
Czar Nicholas II, and after the assassination she was under house
arrest in the Crimea with her seven children,'' Romanoff said the
other day. Sometime near the end of 1918, the occupying German
government allowed the family to escape Russia on the British
warship, HMS Marlborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandmother was a first cousin of King George V, and so when
she arrived in England she got a `grace and favor' home on the
grounds of Windsor Castle,'' Romanoff said. Romanoff was born in
England in 1923 and went to an English boarding school. When
Britain went to war with Germany, he joined the British Navy as an
ordinary seaman, spending World War II fighting the Germans in
North Africa and on the beaches of Normandy and escorting Russian
supply convoys on the brutal Murmansk run across the Arctic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he joined his uncle Vasili Romanov in Northern
California, where the last Russian prince born in Russia before the
revolution had happily settled into a career as a chicken farmer in
Sonoma County. Vasili Romanov later moved to Woodside, where he
died in 1989, having passed on to Andrew Romanoff the idea that
being a royal meant little in America and that there was, indeed,
life after imperial Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a lot of things,'' Andrew Romanoff said, as he
padded about his house, dressed in blue jeans, sandals and a white
dress shirt. ``I worked as a tree surgeon for a while, and I was in
the shipping business in Hong Kong and Japan. I've been a
carpenter, and now I'm an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, he did not like to talk about the royal side of his
life _ ``I try to have it there, in my life, but I don't dwell on
it'' _ but since the fanfare that erupted after the bones of the
murdered czar and his family were exhumed in 1991, he has been a
cooperative witness for historians and students who flock to his
home, seeking more and more details of the legendary Romanov story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only in the last few years that he's come out of the
closet on this,'' says his wife, artist Inez Storer. ``He was
always very reticent about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Storer said that when she and Romanoff were first dating, in the
early 1970s, they went to see the movie ``Nicholas and Alexandra,''
which details the bloody Romanov assassination and the events
leading up to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``About halfway through,'' she said, ``I glanced at him and he
looked ghastly, completely rigid. I said, `We can leave anytime,'
and he said, `No, my uncle said we have to see this, and we'll
stay.' Afterward, he told me it was very painful.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as Romanov historian Robert K. Massie points out, that
painful brush with history is an isolated incident for modern-day
Romanovs, most of whom live ordinary lives devoid of any royal
trappings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try to figure out where the Romanovs sit in the world,
it's like asking what happened to the Bourbons or the Hapsburgs or
all the other descendants of emperors and kings,'' Massie says.
``Those institutions didn't last, and the families went on. Someone
like Andrew has made a splendid adjustment _ he has no pretension
to being anybody other than who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Massie, author of the best-selling ``Nicholas and Alexandra''
and ``The Romanovs: The Final Chapter,'' says most members of the
family have no interest in making any claims on Russia _ ``all the
sensible Romanovs regard themselves as figures of the historical
past and not of a political future.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the possibility of squirreled-away royal treasure comes
up, Massie says, ``They don't have any money. If they have it, they
either made it or married it. There was no money left after the
revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The other day, sitting in their kitchen, Romanoff and Storer
winced at the mention of what it would cost to get their family to
Russia and back this week.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Petersburg, they will be staying at the Hotel Astoria,
where the rooms go for about $1,600 a day, not unusual in the
whacked-out economy of post-Soviet Russia, but a bit startling to a
couple of artists from Inverness.
</P>
<P>
   But they did manage to get around this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard _ I think it was from the travel agent _ that they'd
give a rate to a Romanov,'' Storer said, laughing. ``So they got it
down to $320.''

   1. Coming up Monday July 20 : Another story from the NATURE News
Service confirming that Dolly was indeed cloned from adult cells
and that other animals such as mice have now been cloned from adult
cells as well. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------2. RAISA GORBACHEV INTERVIEW By Carolee
Morrison Not so long ago, in the mid-1980s, Raisa Gorbachev, in her
crisp pastel business suits, became an internationally known figure
as the Kremlin's first visible first lady. Now, at age
sixtysomething, she is still a voice to be heard, particularly in
support of women and children, struggling to advance, or merely to
survive, in the morass of post-communist Russia. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------3. AND LUXURY FOR ALL By Holly Brubach from
the New York Times Magazine Luxury used to be the province of the
old rich. Bernard Arnault, the French fashion magnate whose empire
includes Christian Dior, Givenchy,Veuve Clicquot, Louis Vuitton and
Guerlain, is often accused of being too American - he has made
luxury available to anyone with the money to buy it. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------4. STEVEN SPIELBERG
GOES TO WAR - A rare interview by Cindy Pearlman - 1.400 words
Steven Spielberg is the world's richest movie director, its most
popular and its most powerful. He has a couple of Oscars for
``Schindler's List'', his own movie studio and no fewer than four
of his films graced the American Film Institute's recent list of
the 100 best American films. But the director continues to
challenge himself. His latest film, the ambitious World War II epic
``Saving Private Ryan'' will soon be released. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------5. EUROPE'S PAST MUST
NOT BE ASIA'S FUTURE By Fareed Zakaria - A New York Times Op-Ed -
2.000 words Fareed Zakaria, managing editor of Foreign Affairs
Magazine, says that since all the other assumptions of the Asian
crisis have proven wrong, it is naive to think it will not
profoundly affect the United States. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------6. THE PEACE THAT
FAILED AT 4:30 a.m. SUNDAY by Sebastian Barry - A New York TImes
Op-Ed - 800 words Sebastian Barry, a playwright and the author of
``Prayers of Sherkin'' and ``The Steward of Christendom'', finds
himself in the same situation as the father of the three Irish
children who were burned alive on Sunday: he is Catholic, his wife
is Protestant and they have three young children. He writes that
the upheavals of the Orangemen in the Drumcree area of Portadown
may have provided the necessary cloak of passion and righteousness
for the attack. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------7. IT WILL TAKE FORCE
TO END FIGHTING IN KOSOVO By Flora Lewis - 800 words The fighting
has stopped in Bosnia, 300.000 troops have been demobilized, and
people are starting although rather slowly and cautiously to
rebuild their homes. But the region is still a long way from safe
sailing away from its storms of violence. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------8. WHAT'S DOING IN
WASHINGTON By David E. Sanger from the New York Times Way to Go -
2.000 words Washington has always been a city of multiple
personalities. There is monumental Washington, the mecca for
tourists who line up for the White House tour, wander the
statue-lined halls of Congress and cram the National Air and Space
Museum. There is green Washington, the leafy parks and residential
neighborhoods of Northwest, and the jogging routes through Rock
Creek Park. And there is dysfunctional Washington, the world's most
famously mismanaged capital, parts of which are plagued by crime,
troubled schools and deeply impoverished neighborhoods where few
tour buses stray. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------9. SAVE YOUR OWN SKIN By Gale Hayman - 1.000
words How, once and for all, do you really protect yourself against
the sun? Gale Hayman, author of ``How Do I Look?'' and co-founder
of the Giorgio boutique in Beverly Hills, shows how to protect and
beautify skin at this, the riskiest time of the year. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------10. ROBOTIC SURGERY By
Kathy A. Svitil from Discover Magazine - 700 words Surgeons make
big incisions because of the need to get their hands in the body.
But with laparoscopic surgery, tiny robotic hands, their incisions
can be made smaller. Patients are less traumatized, require shorter
hospital stay and heal faster than with conventional procedure. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------11. YOUR NEXT CAR WILL
BE GREENER INSIDE by Paul Eisenstein From Diversion - 1.800 words
Marvin Rush spends his life living in the future. As
cinematographer for the television series ``Star Trek: Voyager'',
he works in the 24th century. But even when the set shuts down for
the night and Rush heads home, he's still a few light-years ahead
of the other folks commuting on L.A.'s crowded freeways : He is
driving one of the first electric vehicles sold in the United
States, a lightweighttwo seater that some see as the automotive
answer for tomorrow.

COMMENTARY: HELL FREEZES OVER  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno told the Senate
Judiciary Committee's Arlen Specter on Wednesday she was prepared
to take _ and in reality evade _ his questions about Chinese
penetration of the White House ``until hell freezes over.''
</P>
<P>
   That was an apt metaphor for an investigation long encased in
ice. Twenty-one months ago, journalists discovered evidence of
financial corruption in the 1996 political campaign led by a band
of Asian-Americans close to Clinton-Gore who were fronting for
illegal overseas money.
</P>
<P>
   But even after the FBI reported a connection to Beijing
intelligence, the Reno Justice Department hid its head in the sand.
First the investigation was assigned to ``Public Integrity''
incompetents. After newspapers dug up facts unknown to her
time-servers, she again avoided independent counsel by appointing a
supposedly hotshot San Diego prosecutor _ who indicted small fry
identified earlier in press reports but then hastily bailed out as
the trail led into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   This week the New York Times reporters Don Van Natta Jr. and
David Johnston revealed that the revolving-door Justice team was
now disheartened and floundering. A Times editorial nailed down the
reason: ``If you want to prevent a ship from reaching its
destination, just keep changing the navigators.''
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with this, the attorney general sniffed: ``one
newspaper editorial should not dictate public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   But this investigation was initiated by ``leaks'' in print from
journalism to Justice, not the other way around. And the need to
take it out of the hands of a deeply conflicted Justice Department,
it turns out, is supported by the man best in a position to know:
FBI Director Louis Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh has been worried all along that secret intelligence
gathered by the Bureau and the National Security Agency would make
its way back to the top White House policy makers close to the
Chinese operatives and most interested in shutting down the
investigation. In November of last year, this former federal judge
sent a 27-page legal memo to Reno urging her to seek independent
counsel that could safely work with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has that report in her deep freeze. Freeh won't make public
his disagreement with her cover-up. But on June 19, the FBI general
counsel briefed Sens. Fred Thompson and John Glenn in detail on the
contents of Freeh's dissent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult'' the FBI counsel reported Freeh to have
written, ``to imagine a more compelling situation for appointing an
independent counsel. . . . it's a conflict for the attorney general
to investigate her superiors.''
</P>
<P>
   Did the law require Reno to have an actual conflict, as she had
told the Senate, and not merely the appearance of one? Not true,
according to Freeh; such a Justice Department proposal was
specifically rejected by a then-Democratic Congress as recently as
1994. ``The Attorney General can consider appearance,'' wrote the
FBI director, ``as well as actual conflict, might weaken public
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Thompson reported that the ultimate conclusion by Freeh
was that the independent counsel law, which arose from Watergate
and was closely tied to campaign finance law, ``should be triggered
under both the mandatory and discretionary provisions of the
statute.''
</P>
<P>
   The discretionary part is inescapable, Freeh pointed out,
because ``the attorney general's chief investigator has concluded
that there is a political conflict of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   To these revelations of direct opposition from the FBI to her
unlawful misjudgment, Reno took refuge in her power to impose
secrecy: ``Our understanding was that the briefing was confidential
...'' Thompson disagreed; though Freeh's detailed opinion was hers
to suppress, ``As far as the oral part was concerned, we were under
no restraints ...''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when journalists are agonizingly examining our own
sources and methods, we do well to remember that this fund-raising
corruption affecting our national security was unearthed by
responsible reporters and is driven by fearless editorialists.
Clinton justice would rather await sub-zero in Hades.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent embassy reception, I ran into Louis Freeh. The only
thing he would say was, ``You guys led the way.''
</P>

 &HT;    COLUMN: Beware congressmen bearing Teddies
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans who are worried their lousy
environmental voting records may hurt them at the polls have
created a fake environmental organization and have started giving
each other trophies that declare them environmental champions _
something to show the home folks. It is a scam of breathtaking
brazenness.
</P>
<P>
   Understand, please, that not all Republicans have it in for
Mother Nature, though those who do not are a dwindling number.
Thirty-eight Republicans in the House and six in the Senate score
50 percent or better with the League of Conservation Voters. The
senators were crucial recently in blocking legislation to grease a
legal fast track for property-rights claims against zoning,
land-use planning and conservation.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP invented environmentalism with President Theodore
Roosevelt's national parks, wildlife refuges and innovative forest
management. President Richard Nixon set up the Environmental
Protection Agency and signed the Clear Air, Clean Water and
Endangered Species Acts. No major environmental law was enacted
without substantial Republican support.
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, Ronald Reagan hit the White House, denouncing
trees as the great polluters. GOP environmental stewardship has
been on the skids ever since and reached its low point, so far,
with the election of a horde of hot-to-trot conservatives in the
1994 congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty much those folks who have created the new Coalition
of Republican Environmental Advocates. CREA says it's for
free-market, non-bureaucratic, property rights-oriented solutions
to environmental problems. Translated into real-world English, that
means anything goes if you can make a buck doing it and if the
biosphere collapses, what the hell, we had fun while it lasted,
didn't we?
</P>
<P>
   The group's steering committee is loaded with, and its kickoff
banquet was bankrolled by, lobbyists for the oil, coal, paper,
mining and chemical industries. The conservation league figures
Senate members of the group averaged only 8 out of 100 on its key
votes, House members 23 _ miles below the over-all Senate average
of 46 and House average of 47.
</P>
<P>
   CREA fingers are on the triggers in the current fusillade of
legislative sniping that is using amendments to essential
legislation to pick off environmental targets _ amendments to
increase national-forest logging, run roads through wildlife
refuges, bar salmon restoration on habitat rivers, import dangerous
chemicals banned years ago and cut funding for environmental
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Shamelessly, though, the perps are now giving themselves
``Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Awards'' _ Teddies. One went to
Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, with a zero rating by the League of
Conservation Voters. Theodore Roosevelt IV, the president's
great-grandson, said, ``T.R. would be outraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Appalled at the radicalized GOP's outright animus to nature,
environment-minded Republicans have formed REP America in hopes of
returning conservation to the high place it once held in Republican
esteem. So far, the group is a voice in the wilderness, but that
could change soon. Congress may do away with the wilderness.

 &HT;    We need to sell patience, understanding at the store
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was standing in the line at the grocery store and, boy, was I
hot.
</P>
<P>
   It had nothing to do with the near-triple digit temperatures
outside. No, I was hot as in angry. Angry at the world, at the
store management, at the cashier, and most especially of all at the
woman who had dumped half a million products on the check-out line
in front of me.
</P>
<P>
   And I was beyond angry because this, after all, was the express
line.
</P>
<P>
   It was marked express and I was standing still, but not in time.
The second hand on my watch was sweeping along at a frightening
pace. I am an Important Person with oodles of Important Things to
do. I couldn't be waiting at the check out line.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't be waiting, but there I was. People pulled in with
carts behind me, stopped for a few minutes, then fled to shorter,
faster lines. As there was always someone behind me, I could not
move. The conveyor belt on the check-out counter was making more
progress.
</P>
<P>
   I was thinking it couldn't get worse when it did. Thinking
things cannot get worse is a sure-fire way to make that happen.
</P>
<P>
   The woman's bill rang up to $123.41. The lady in front of me
pulled out a wad of cash and handed it, crumpled up, to the
cashier. She carefully counted it out.
</P>
<P>
   It was $80. The woman had miscalculated her purchasing power by
about one-third.
</P>
<P>
   The cashier, who had (it seemed to me) gone about the checking
process rather slowly, gave the woman a sweet smile and told her
that she did not have enough money.
</P>
<P>
   The woman looked confused for a moment and then said, ``Can I
put some of it back?''
</P>
<P>
   I stomped my foot.
</P>
<P>
   The cashier ignored me and flashed the woman another warm smile.
Sure. It was fine. Just pick out what needs to be returned.
</P>
<P>
   My anger turned up another notch and I turned my head. The
people behind me were beginning to grumble, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Why couldn't this cashier speed things up? Why was she letting
this woman hold up the progress of an entire line of Important
People?
</P>
<P>
   Still, the cashier paid no attention. She was focused on the
customer at hand, who seemed to me to be intent on taking the
longest time possible in deciding what to return. Small things,
worth only a dollar or two were being taken off the total.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to suggest that the lady put back that curling iron.
Heck, that was almost $20 by itself. I wanted to raise my voice.
More, still, I wanted the cashier to raise her voice. Get this
thing moving, let progress march forward.
</P>
<P>
   It was about that time that my wife pointed out to me something
I had missed. This was no ordinary transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The woman in front of me in line that day, though she must have
been in her 20s, had perhaps the intelligence level of a 9- or
10-year-old. Someone had given her the money to go shopping,
perhaps to buy whatever she wanted, perhaps to buy food for the
week. I hope the latter isn't true, because
</P>
<P>
   there was very little food in the basket.
</P>
<P>
   It was taking all the mental ability that the woman could muster
to look at the items, think about how much they cost, make a
decision and ask that they be returned.
</P>
<P>
   The cashier was being an angel in the truest sense of the word.
I wouldn't be surprised to learn she had spotted this mentally
challenged woman and urged her to come into her line, express lane
or not.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe such a thing could get a cashier in trouble with the store
management, but she certainly scored high that day on the test of
being a human being.
</P>
<P>
   Though the pressure was on from me and others, the cashier never
once treated that customer with anything less than the utmost
respect. When she found that she had purchased something
unnecessary, she called over another store official to help her get
her money back. When we made our quick purchases she apologized,
``for all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   If life were like a grocery store, we might all be a little
different. I might buy a little patience, much more humility and a
waistline that would fit into some of my trousers. The
mentally-challenged woman could find herself a brain that would
allow her to live life in the mainstream where people like me
wouldn't treat her with either impatience or indifference.
</P>
<P>
   What the cashier could buy to improve herself, I just don't
know, but she could sure sell a little understanding to all of us
who pass through her line.

 &HT;    George Chalhub has a quiet spot in a very busy place
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ He gets up before 6 because when you're
84, that's just what you do. But, also, the trees and the vines and
the shrubs await him. Mangoes. Watermelons. Lemons. Pineapples. The
yard is a veritable collection of lollipop flavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be plenty of tangerines,'' says George Chalhub.
``You can come over any time to pick them.''
</P>
<P>
   Chalhub started growing things 52 years ago on this patch of
land not far from what today is Palm Beach International Airport.
Back then, a few little planes took off now and then from the
airstrip nearby, and Chalhub and the missus and the three kids
would wander over there to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing here,'' he says. ``This was all
wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's all changed. There's development all around his
little town of Glen Ridge now. Heck, there's even a porn store
right around the corner. The missus is gone; she died on a Sunday
morning four years ago this October. Just fell off the couch from a
massive heart attack as he was getting himself ready for church.
And the three kids, well, they're grown with jobs and mortgages and
kids' college tuitions of their own.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves George Chalhub, a man who leads a quiet life in a
busy place.
</P>
<P>
   Chalhub figures he has about 100 assorted trees on his 2 1/2
acres. Years ago, whenever he'd visit somewhere, he'd come back
with a little something: a lemon tree, a plum tree, even an olive
branch. All these years later, he can grind coffee from his own
beans. (``Although it's a lot of work,'' he warns.) He can stand
there in the heat of the morning, his hands wet from the juice of a
ripe Haden mango.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest pleasure I have in the world is to go outside,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   And a mighty big pleasure it is, when you've got cataracts and a
heart valve that's leaking and a counter full of medicine that
needs swallowing every morning. Thursday was Chalhub's birthday,
his 84th, and don't ya know, he got the calls you'd hope to get on
your 84th. He heard from his brothers, 85 and 81, and he heard from
the folks at his church. They all called bright and early, of
course, but George had already been outside, picking.
</P>
<P>
   That's what he does each morning, makes the tour of his land.
Thank goodness it all doesn't bloom or bear fruit at once, because
Chalhub might be doing just fine for his age, thank you very much,
but he is, after all, an old man with only two hands.
</P>
<P>
   What a smorgasbord awaits him each day! The Indian nut tree
right outside his back door, next to the gardenia, and the
pistachio that doesn't bear fruit. (Too hot here.) The apple tree _
they're delicious, literally _ the 12 varieties of avocado and the
pomegranate. The kids used to love those! Every morning when it's
bearing fruit, Chalhub picks a bunch of boysenberries off the bush
and takes them inside to eat with his cereal. Now, that's some good
eating. And bananas, the little, lady finger kind, are ``as sweet
as sugar.'' He swears.
</P>
<P>
   Then, step right over here, please, to the lemon tree and, oh
yeah, the papaya, although ol' George _ who will eat just about
anything _ isn't too crazy about papayas. He much prefers a good,
juicy sapodilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I square 'em in four pieces and eat 'em like that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Grapes. Figs. Cucumbers. Tomatoes. And watermelons. Lots of
them. ``Of course,'' says Chalhub nonchalantly, ``everyone has
watermelons.'' Which is true. It's just that most of us buy ours at
the market.
</P>
<P>
   This land, these memories, this constant cycle of life, have
given George Chalhub his greatest pleasures. But today, with his
wife Evelyn gone, so much is different.
</P>
<P>
   There is no one to take the apples he brings in and make them
into a pie. No one to make the mango bread. And the kids have been
bugging him to sell lately. He supposes he will, someday soon.
</P>
<P>
   But not yet.
</P>
<P>
   So, the next time you are dashing off to somewhere in an
airplane, cramped between two fighting children, already tense and
nervous about going wherever it is you are going to go, stop and
think of a man named George Chalhub.
</P>
<P>
   He could be right down there below you on his little patch of
paradise, the juice from a ripe sapodilla dripping off his wobbly
chin.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Yes! It's the American Way!
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's all for sale in America. That's the way it is. That's the
way it oughta be. Otherwise, it wouldn't be America.
</P>
<P>
   We bought Jackie O's stuff at auction, Princess Di's dresses,
the car Jayne Mansfield died in. We bought the gun that Jack Ruby
used to shoot Lee Harvey Oswald. We buy it all. We sell it all.
This is the Golden Age of shopping.
</P>
<P>
   If the Zapruder movie of JFK's assassination were not for sale,
we'd have cause for worry.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because somebody would have to decide it wasn't for sale.
Somebody in a position of power. I don't want anyone telling me
what to buy, what to see and, most important, what to think.
</P>
<P>
   But the Zapruder film is for sale, thank goodness _ 26 seconds
of pure historical document. It's not opinion, not conjecture. This
film is pure primary source, the stuff of archives. My archives, if
I so elect.
</P>
<P>
   It's for sale, and the fact that it is verifies our freedom.
I'll sleep a little better tonight knowing that the forces of
mercantilism once again bested the forces of moral outrage.
</P>
<P>
   We're more than the land of the free; we're the land of the
deeply discounted, the clearance, the going-out-of-business sale.
We sell conspiracy theories, advice, solace, drama, karma and
dreams. More important, we buy it all. And we love to buy history,
real or imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The Titanic a grave site to be revered? Baloney. You can buy the
Titanic's coal through your Sunday newspaper. We crave so much to
know what it was like on that cold April night that we've spent
more than a billion dollars sating our voyeurism at a movie that
cost more to make than the original ship. We buy anything.
</P>
<P>
   But then we sift through it all, discard the junk, laugh at the
outrageous, maybe learn something along the way. Free expression
derives from free thought, which derives from unfettered access to
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Some things are not and should not be for sale: the
Constitution, politicians, truth, rights, air and Guinness Stout.
Alas, the Guinness family has property rights to Guinness Stout, so
per our Constitution, the Guinness folks get to sell their product
to those, like me, who choose to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Same with the Zapruder family. It owns the movie and, by golly,
it can sell that movie. Willing seller, willing buyer. That's what
makes the world go round.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the basic argument against selling the Zapruder film:
It's volatile, disturbing, bound to confuse those who don't know
history (the masses) and is best kept safe to be studied by
professional scholars and archivists.
</P>
<P>
   Well, in 16th-century England, the politicians and priests used
the same argument against publishing in English a book they knew,
in their wisdom, would only inflame the masses and lead to
wholesale anarchy and radical goings on.
</P>
<P>
   The book in question was the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Another argument against marketing the movie: Selling it is
crass and opportunistic.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody should have a copy of this historical document, free
of charge, like the Constitution. But then, we own the
Constitution, while the Zapruder family owns the copyrights to the
movie. There's that pesky concept of private property again.
</P>
<P>
   Look, we've been dipping shirts in the blood of martyrs since
there were shirts and martyrs. Enough pieces of the True Cross were
sold to naive pilgrims during the Middle Ages to build a forest of
oak trees. We've always bought, always sold, always flim-flammed
and fleeced each other. It's only human.
</P>
<P>
   But the Zapruder film is the real thing. This is no ``JFK,'' the
movie. This is no Titanic reproduction. It's the real thing, and I
don't want a techno-priest to interpret it for me.
</P>
<P>
   I certainly didn't like it when the editors of Life withheld
portions of the film they said would disturb me. Speaking of Life,
before JFK was in his grave, Life had bought the rights to the film
for $150,000. Exclusive rights.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but I'm as suspicious of exclusive
rights as I am of exclusive clubs. Always seems like I'm excluded.
</P>
<P>
   When history becomes the exclusive domain of those with
exclusive rights, then history gets rewritten. Usually with bad
results.
</P>
<P>
   So, you don't want to look at the film? Don't buy it. Just tell
me where to go. To buy the tape, that is.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Zapruder film distorts history
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is pretty much all you need to know about the new,
digitally enhanced version of the Zapruder film: 53 minutes, 39
seconds. That's how long you have to wait for the clearest,
closest, slow-motion view of President Kennedy's head exploding.
</P>
<P>
   That's all anyone wants to see, isn't it? Really, that's all
there is.
</P>
<P>
   If you were hoping the wonders of computer manipulation would
reveal a shadowy figure on the grassy knoll, too bad. All you'll
see if you buy the tape that goes on sale for $19.95 this week is a
much sharper, much more colorful replay of the clip you already
watched a dozen times. Or a hundred.
</P>
<P>
   So shocking, so sad when the first frames were published in Life
magazine a week after President Kennedy's death, the Zapruder film
has been rerun so many times on news shows, talk shows and
documentaries that it is as familiar and unreal as an old episode
of ``Gunsmoke'' or ``Bonanza.''
</P>
<P>
   It's so grainy, blurred and jerky that it seems like something
from a more distant time, like the crash of the Hindenburg or the
sinking of the Maine. The new version is so much more vivid that it
restores the shock of human tragedy. That may be its only virtue.
</P>
<P>
   There's certainly nothing of value in the first three-quarters
of the tape, unless you always wanted to see and hear more about
the late Abraham Zapruder, lionized as a prescient historical
preservationist.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas dress manufacturer turned his home-movie camera on
the presidential motorcade before the first shot was fired and held
his focus for 26 seconds. It's the only known moving image of the
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Zapruder, the tape reveals, had the presence of mind to put the
film in his company safe before sitting down in his office for a
good cry. He recovered sufficient composure by the next day to
begin negotiations with Life, which paid him $150,000 for all
rights. Life sold the rights back to Zapruder's family for $1 after
his death.
</P>
<P>
   While he resisted Secret Service pressure to surrender the
original, Zapruder did turn over a copy and later allowed the
Warren Commission, which investigated the president's death, to
examine the original. The digital version is billed as a new and
valuable research tool, as well as ``a collector's item for all
Americans!''
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything at all admirable in this? Not that I can see.
</P>
<P>
   If Zapruder or his heirs had any real interest in history or
public service, the original film would have been turned over to a
university research center. Of course, there would have been no
profit in that. And there would be no digital version to profit
from today.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: This is no historical document. Digitally
enhanced images make great entertainment, but they are distortions.
Computers don't really ``restore'' lost information; they're merely
a high-tech method of coloring in the missing bits. The great value
of computers over crayons for this sort of work is that computer
enhancement is seamless: You can't tell what's been added or
altered.
</P>
<P>
   So, even if you did see a shadow on the grassy knoll, you'd have
to wonder if it was really there in the original. But I don't
suppose anyone will really worry about that when the first Zapruder
video parties are held this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And I don't suppose it really says much about our times or our
society that people really will do that, or that some will include
the kids, and a few will serve nachos.
</P>
<P>
   If the technology existed, there surely would have been an
audience for Caesar's assassination, and Lincoln's.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Secretary of War Edwin McMasters Stanton, who took
control of the government the night Lincoln was shot, tried to
thwart the power of morbid curiosity by ordering that no pictures
be taken of the dead president.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the market boomed with drawings of the death scene, some
realistic and some ``enhanced'' with the inclusion of characters
who weren't really there, such as Lincoln's son Tad.
</P>
<P>
   One boarder at the rooming house where Lincoln died managed to
sneak into the room to take a picture after the body was removed.
The photograph, hidden for many years, showed the blood-soaked
pillow that held Lincoln's head and the short, wooden chair where
Mary Lincoln sat sobbing at his side.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in some ways, as powerful and affecting as any image on
the Zapruder film and every bit as instructive. You might cry
watching the Zapruder tape, you might feel nauseated or even a bit
ashamed, but you won't learn anything.
</P>
<P>
   You might as well just fast-forward to 53:39 and be done with
it.

 &HT;    Be kind to your car: Buy good gasoline
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Gasoline is a hot topic these days. Three readers
have fuel-related questions, two about fuel quality and one about
gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   Let's tackle the confusion about fuel first.
</P>
<P>
   David Harris writes: ``I take excellent care of our three cars
(change the oil every 2,500 miles, etc.), but I buy the cheapest
gasoline I can find. How do I determine which fuel is a
good-quality fuel?''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially all gasoline, no matter where it comes from, must go
through the same process to get it from crude oil to a combustible
fuel. Further refinement of this fuel produces what is commonly
referred to as either ``regular'' or ``premium'' gasoline, which is
only a rating of the fuel's ability to resist knock.
</P>
<P>
   Either the refiner or the retailer determines the differences
between the fuel quality, which depends on the special chemicals
added to the base fuel. Additives include detergents for the
control of deposits, corrosion inhibitors and antioxidants, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say Fish Oil Co. is a large refiner and retailer of
gasoline. The gasoline in its storage tanks is the basically the
same as that of Olive Oil Co., another refiner.
</P>
<P>
   When the tanker truck fills up with Fish Oil fuel for delivery
to its own stations, a special additive package that ``won't clog
fuel injectors and keeps the inside of your engine sparkling
clean'' is mixed with the fuel in the truck before it is delivered
to Fish Oil retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The Olive Oil distributors use a similar ``clean and healthy
engine'' additive package for their Olive Oil service stations.
</P>
<P>
   Zoom Co. has a large chain of quickie marts/gas stations. It
buys its fuel from the lowest bidder and adds it own ``we guarantee
our gas'' package to the gasoline it sells.
</P>
<P>
   Snake Oil Co., a small independent chain of stations
specializing in cheap gasoline, also buys the least expensive fuel.
</P>
<P>
   However, to keep prices low, this company doesn't use an
additive package. Snake Oil gas is 10 cents a gallon cheaper than
Fish or Olive Oil gas and 5 cents less than Zoom, but that savings
will be short-lived by the customer.
</P>
<P>
   Without the benefit of the fuel additives, a car -- especially
if it is fuel injected -- is more likely to develop the
driveability problems all of those chemicals were designed to
eliminate. Combustion chamber deposits, varnish buildup on fuel
injectors, fuel system component corrosion and PCV valve gook are
the most common.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when a person is experiencing poor engine performance,
the first question I ask is: ``Where are you buying your gas?''
</P>
<P>
   The pat reply I hear is: ``With the money I save in gas, I can
buy those bottles of gas cleaner stuff they sell at auto parts
stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong answer. Excessive use of these products can damage fuel
systems. Not enough and you have the same cheap-gas problems as
before. If you are a chemical engineer, you may be able to arrive
at the right formula, but personally, I don't want to think that
hard.
</P>
<P>
   Good-quality gasoline contains an additive package and is sold
at reputable, high-volume retailers. Some will even supply you with
information on the additives and their benefits, if you ask. Don't
take chances with your car's fuel system. Buy good gas.

 &HT;    Spielberg and Hanks talk about new film
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ In his new World War II film ``Saving Private Ryan,''
Steven Spielberg _ who grumbles that he's known chiefly for pumping
our emotions with a plastic shark and a plastic alien _ strove for
a battleground realism hitherto unseen at the movies.
</P>
<P>
   If that meant showing bullets reducing human heads to red
confetti, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   If that meant depicting a young soldier writhing in a mound of
his own guts, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   And if that meant Spielberg would again, following the gruelling
historical epics ``Schindler's List'' and ``Amistad,'' subvert his
hardened reputation as kiddie-friendly confectionery, then so be
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which is why I have decided for the first time in 17 years to
travel around the country with my movie _ to warn parents and kids
that this is a very, very honest and graphic look at war and to be
prepared for that,'' says Spielberg, reclining in a Dallas hotel
suite. ``If you're 14 or under, you shouldn't see the movie at all.
This is not one of my kinder, gentler movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Many films have wrenchingly portrayed war as hell. ``Saving
Private Ryan'' portrays war as slaughter. The lengthy film's first
30 minutes reenact the storming of Omaha Beach on D-Day, June 6,
1944. Under cloud-choked skies, Allied forces alight from steel
Higgins boats and press onto the sloshy sands, only to meet head-on
a symphonic barrage of bullets and shrapnel. Sea and sand are
promptly mottled by the blood and viscera of a thousand young men,
a Francis Bacon painting writ large, and real.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's blinkless verisimilitude spurs historian Stephen E.
Ambrose to declare ``Saving Private Ryan'' ``the best war movie
ever made and by far the most honest portrayal we've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers consulted three of Ambrose's bestselling books _
``D-Day: The Climactic Battle of World II,'' ``Citizen Soldiers''
and ``Band of Brothers'' _ for source and reference material.
Though Ambrose was never directly contacted during production, he
is credited as the film's historical consultant. He is touring with
Spielberg to promote the film.
</P>
<P>
   Opening nationwide Friday, ``Ryan'' stars Tom Hanks as the
captain of an eight-man Army squad, which includes Edward Burns
(``The Brothers McMullen'') and Tom Sizemore (``Heat''), on a
special mission to retrieve a single soldier, Pvt. James Ryan,
played by Matt Damon.
</P>
<P>
   Six other Hollywood films about World War II are reportedly in
the works, including ``The Thin Red Line,'' the highly anticipated
work-in-progress by Austin's Terrence Malick based on the James
Jones novel. The film, slated for a fall release, stars Sean Penn,
George Clooney and John Travolta. It's all part of a resurgence in
public interest in the war, which Ambrose ascribes to our
collective ``yearning for heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   In Spielberg's film, Pvt. Ryan's three brothers have been killed
in combat within days of one another. After delivering all three
telegrams to the Ryans' mother on the same day, the Army, in a
display of feel-good public relations, decides to pluck Ryan out of
the war and send him home. Robert Rodat's screenplay was inspired
by the true story told in Ambrose's ``Band of Brothers,'' in which
Fritz Niland, of the 101st Airborne, loses three brothers in a week
during the war and is delivered to the arms of his mother.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with Ambrose, Spielberg, Hanks and Damon,
however, the story recedes into low-relief, quickly eclipsed by the
subject of Spielberg's frank and grisly treatment of combat
carnage. With them, the words ``realism'' and ``graphic'' assume
incantatory power.
</P>
<P>
   After a slew of explicit Vietnam movies in the 1980s, Spielberg
says it's about time people saw World War II in a similarly
unvarnished manner, stripped of romantic hyperbole, fraudulent
glory and John Ford-style mythologizing.
</P>
<P>
   To place their picture in perspective, Spielberg and Hanks
screened 25 war films, from ``The Longest Day'' to Sam Fuller's
``The Steel Helmet,'' before shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   ``It occurred to me that all the films made during the war were
propaganda films to bolster the courage of the home front and to
sell war bonds,'' Spielberg says. ``The films unashamedly put
everyone on a pedestal and made everyone a hero. When we got out of
the war years and Hollywood was no longer part of the war
information department, films became a little more honest, like
William Wellman's `Battleground.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But Vietnam changed everything. It was the first time a war
was fought in our living rooms, and that was when people started to
see the difference between our boys suffering and John Wayne
screaming `Lock and Load! Saddle up!' in `The Sands of Iwo Jima.'
Vietnam certainly informed me in how to make a picture about
combat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a post-Vietnam-era film,'' says Damon. ``There was a
shift in consciousness because of the violence in `Platoon' and
`Full Metal Jacket.' We're willing to look at it now. A war movie
doesn't have to be blindingly patriotic. This movie doesn't say
that we shouldn't have been there. It just says that this is what
they saw. I think this generation demands that of war films now.
The bar was raised in showing combat, and I think Steven has raised
it again.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be tempting to regard the film's staggering volume of
mutilated flesh as typical Spielbergian manipulation _ hitting
strategic emotional targets with the Enola Gay instead of a
bayonet. The director of ``Jaws,'' ``E.T.'' and ``Raiders of the
Lost Ark'' demurs, saying technical decisions, from using handheld
cameras and desaturated color film stock to studying the famous war
photos of Robert Capa, abetted the sense of verity as much as the
staged carnage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can be manipulative and devilish when it comes to big
entertainment movies. I've done that all of my career,'' Spielberg
says. ``But something like this, where there's so much chaos and
confusion on a beach and you're being fired upon from three
different directions and people are dying and you're trying to find
some refuge from all that murderous cross-fire, everything's a
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   To create that level of pitched anarchy, Spielberg chose not to
storyboard scenes. ``Not one. That was because I didn't know what
it was like to fight a war until I started fighting it. I had to
fight the war in my own small way. My production had to take the
beach an inch at a time the same way those rangers did 54 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't use any special effects or technology to instill any
kind of unease in the audience. I simply took a camera the way a
signal corps combat cameraman would shoot an actual event unfolding
before his eyes. I made the whole movie basically as a member of
the signal corps.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Damon, who appears late and relatively briefly in the
movie, the principal actors were required to undergo six days of
military boot camp under the hectoring command of retired Marine
Capt. Dale Dye, who served as the film's senior military advisor.
His other many advisory credits include ``Platoon,'' ``Forrest
Gump,'' ``Starship Troopers'' and ``Small Soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   WWII has riveted Spielberg since he was a child growing up in
Scottsdale, Ariz., listening to the battle stories of his father,
who fought in Burma during the war. A brainy, wide-eyed kid, he
compulsively watched war movies on television and at age 14 made
one of his first films, an 8 mm WWII flick ``Escape to Nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about a bunch of soldiers, a bunch of 13-year-old kids
wearing helmet liners and dyed T-shirts, who went into battle
against the Germans. I shot it on an old Indian pueblo,'' Spielberg
says.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, many of his movies have been about or set around the
time of WWII _ two of the Indiana Jones movies, ``1941,''
``Schindler's List,'' ``Empire of the Sun,'' and now ``Saving
Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Frumpy in a beige cardigan and dark jeans, the director is
surprisingly diminutive in person. With his pointy features and
short beard, the word ``impish'' clings to him as tenaciously as
``devilish'' does to Jack Nicholson. Damon is the picture of pin-up
youth, all chain-smoking suavity, which threatens to defile his
smile of sugar cubes. Hanks, natty in black jeans and black blazer,
is as effervescent as he is tall. Between them, these Hollywood
golden boys possess five Academy Awards and an Irving Thalberg
Award. Talk about heavy artillery.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, author Ambrose sits restlessly in his suite, a
grizzled veteran of a thousand battles by way of as many interviews
with as many war vets. His face a thick, tawny map, his voice a
mealy grumble, the bluff Mississippian explains why World War II
has suddenly reached critical mass in public consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have his two recent books, ``Citizen Soldiers'' and
``D-Day,'' together sold nearly a million copies, Hollywood is in
the midst of a WWII film frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling interest, says Ambrose, is the war's recent 50th
anniversary, as well as the ongoing commemorations of the Berlin
airlift, Pearl Harbor and the war-ending bombings of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most importantly it's because we live in an age in which
we have no heroes,'' he says. ``All I need to say is Franklin
Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, and then say Bill Clinton and Tony
Blair and I've made the point. Of course we're far more cynical
than we were 50 years ago, so figures like Douglas MacArthur and
George Patton look a little ridiculous to us. But there were
genuine heroes in World War II, and they were regular guys you can
identify with.''
</P>
<P>
   On the flight out to Dallas, from Los Angeles, Ambrose and Hanks
chewed the cud on this same subject. ``He told me,'' Hanks says. ``
`Look, we're not living in historic times. The most important
things going on right now are Monica Lewinsky and the Internet.
This is not real compelling stuff. This is not life and death. We
have so many distractions in our lives and there's not one single
energizing and binding moment. I think people would really, really
like something like that to bind us.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg submits a different theory about the sudden flux of
WWII movies. ``I think what sparked the interest is me. I'm not
being egocentric, but I find when I announce a project all these
other projects of the same era suddenly come up,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think there is a resurgence in World War II at the end of
the century. People are finally realizing that it was the defining
event of the entire 20th century, and that's one of the reasons I
wanted to tell the story before the end of the century. But I know
once I declare my major there's a lot of people who come out and
declare theirs, and they somehow seem to be the same major.''
</P>
<P>
   But Spielberg is taking the first shot, so to speak, setting the
benchmark of realism for the rest to match, and redressing what was
never shown before.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's been lost in other movies is the absolute personal cost
of what (war) is,'' Hanks says. ``The opening half-hour of `Ryan'
makes it a very, very personal experience for everybody who sees
the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing the completed film was really eye-opening,'' adds
Damon. ``It's as close as we can get to war without going.''

 &HT;    Nostalgic toys bring out the boy in grown-up collectors
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Joan of Arc rides high upon her steed,
battling enemy troops with her lance. A mustachioed Ghengis Khan,
just inches away, stares blankly ahead, a portrait of menacing
calm. Ivan the Terrible is slumped in his wooden throne. And G.I
Joe, dressed as a P.T. boat commander, appears ready for duty at
all times.
</P>
<P>
   Walk into a place like Grande Armee, the Palm Beach store that
sells military antiques and toy soldiers, and it's easy to imagine
all sorts of possibilities:
</P>
<P>
   Maybe when Joan gets done with her hapless enemies she could
just gallop over and gut Ghengis! Rrrrrripppp! Maybe she could flip
the round table over on King Arthur and crush him in front of his
wimpy court members. Splataroo! Then she could vanquish a stiff
line of World War II infantrymen _ rata-tata-rata-tata _ before
being captured and burned at the stake . . . or at least burned at
the Popsicle stick. I'm melting!!!
</P>
<P>
   What is it about toy soldiers and action figures that brings out
the amateur warrior within?
</P>
<P>
   It's an intoxicating fantasy world that the makers of the movie
``Small Soldiers'' hope to tap into. In theaters'the film is a sort
of ``Toy Story'' on Parris Island. The plot revolves around a clash
between a faction of steroid-choked, jar-headed G.I. Joe types and
a bunch of more mild-mannered action figures.
</P>
<P>
   Toy makers are predicting the movie, which features the voices
of Tommy Lee Jones, Denis Leary and Sarah Michelle Gellar (she
plays Buffy the Vampire Slayer on TV), will stoke interest in
military miniatures and action figures among the Sega and Nintendo
generation.
</P>
<P>
   And while it might be obvious why kids love to play with toy
soldiers, it's valid to ask: What's the allure for the grown-ups?
And why do they spend thousands of dollars on elaborate collections
of toys?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a strong desire to play with cheap Japanese plastic,''
jokes Jim Muir.
</P>
<P>
   As manager of Grande Armee's store on Worth Avenue, Muir, 37,
gets to live his hobby. A collector of vintage G.I. Joe action
figures, he's an expert at what makes one toy soldier or G.I. Joe
doll more valuable than another.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this example: After Hasbro started manufacturing
12-inch tall versions of the military mightyman in 1964, they
decided to go after the Barbie crowd. If they could get boys to
play with dolls _ euphemistically called ``action figures'' _ why
couldn't they get girls to cradle a military nurse?
</P>
<P>
   The nurse doll, dressed in a white uniform and accompanied by
medical accessories, was a horrendous flop. ``Hasbro found out the
hard way that girls didn't want to play dolls with their
brothers,'' Muir said. But today, the doll is the Holy Grail for
G.I. Joe collectors and fetches hundreds of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   There are generational differences among G.I. Joe fans, too.
Older collectors tend to go for 12-inch tall figures, while younger
ones focus on acquiring the 3 3/4-inch models Hasbro started
issuing in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who collect toy soldiers, there are factions as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Some only fancy certain time periods _ World War I doughboys or
U.S. Civil war figures. Others stick to specific toy makers such as
W. Britain, a British company from the 1800s. Some current
manufacturers, such as The Petersburg Collection, make military
miniatures of historical figures such as Joan of Arc and Napoleon,
not toy soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Burns of Boynton Beach collects toy soldiers made by W.
Britain. Burns, 59, the president of the South Florida Toy Soldier
Club, began his collection 21 years ago and estimates he has as
many as 6,000 figures arranged in dioramas on the shelves of his
30- by 10-foot Florida room.
</P>
<P>
   His club sponsors a show every year in February in West Palm
Beach that attracts hundreds of enthusiasts. Some collect for the
investment _ figures that sold for 50 cents in the '40s, '50s and
'60s are worth hundreds today. Some collectors are grandparents who
want to introduce the hobby to their grandchildren. Some are
interested because they never had toy soldiers as kids.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, Burns remembers going to the five-and-dime, where you
could buy tiny, colorful lead soldiers individually from glass
decanters on the counter. Back in the '30s and '40s, they were
collected mostly by kids from blue- collar families who could only
afford to buy one figure at a time.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, as parents became aware of the dangers of
lead exposure to children, the figures gave way to plastic versions
of ``army men'' that could be mass- produced. Today, hand-painted
toy soldiers produced in Russia by The Petersburg collection are
the standard for quality in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I collect because of the nostalgia,'' Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Muir said he recognizes the monetary allure that draws many
into the hobby, but he says he's interested in collecting only
pieces he knew and loved as a kid, more pristine versions of what
he and his friends might have thrown into a makeshift backyard
sand-box foxhole and blown up with a firecracker. If you can't
enjoy them as toys, he says, why bother?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still 12 no matter how old I am,'' Muir said. ``When I
open a new box that I've sent away for . . . it's like Christmas.''

 &HT;    German autobahns can teach us lessons
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- It was like a brief trip into automotive heaven. As a
driving enthusiast, the mere mention of the German autobahns has
been like a vision of sugarplums dancing in my head.
</P>
<P>
   It truly was Christmas in July during a trip to Germany. I
jumped at the opportunity when my German-born traveling companion
offered the opportunity to take a turn behind the steering wheel on
her vehicle, a 1999 four-cylinder Saab 9-5 with a light turbo.
</P>
<P>
   Almost coyishly, I asked, ``How fast can I go?''
</P>
<P>
   Her reply: ``As fast as you want; there is no speed limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Her answer was pure symphony music to my ears.
</P>
<P>
   Our trip to Hamburg was roughly 225 miles. Under good
circumstances, we should have made the journey in a little over two
hours. The entire trip was not smooth going.
</P>
<P>
   True, there is no speed limit on the remote stretches of the
autobahns, but the Germans wisely impose speed limits in congested
or populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   The system works with marvelous efficiency. Drivers do not ride
along in the left lane except to pass. Everyone knows the rules: If
you see a car approaching behind you, it is your responsibility to
give way and move to the right lane.
</P>
<P>
   The approaching vehicles don't tailgate. There is no need. If
they close on a vehicle in front of them, they slow some 10 car
lengths or better behind the other vehicle to allow it to move
safely out of the way. On our trip, I saw only one incident in
which the approaching driver blinked his lights as a friendly
reminder to the vehicle ahead to give way.
</P>
<P>
   My companion's comment: ``It must be a tourist. They obviously
don't know the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Our trip was delayed by a seven-mile traffic jam in Bremen. The
autobahn had expanded from two to four lanes. Changeable
illuminated overhead signs posted a speed limit of 60 kmh (about 37
mph) and indicated, via international symbols, congestion ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great time to ``window shop'' in the Germany automotive
``toy store.'' You see many brands of vehicle that are not imported
into the United States -- Fiats, Alfa Romeos, Opels, Vauxhalls,
Citroens and a multitude of models produced by familiar makers that
we also never see. Among them were Mercedes E320s pulling horse
trailers, Ford Modeos (Contours here) cruising down the byway with
a travel trailer in tow and a host of vehicles laden with bicycles.
An American conversion van and a Toyota Land Cruiser seemed out of
place.
</P>
<P>
   The most amazing sight was that in spite of an almost hour delay
in the traffic jam, nobody seemed to get excited. The pace was very
calm and laid back. Perhaps because they knew when they finally
cleared the construction delay, they could make up the time. That
is part of the reason the autobahn system works.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that the Germans take driving very seriously and
require extensive training before granting a driver a license. They
make sure everyone plays by the same rules. Another is that where
there is a speed limit posted, they are serious -- very serious --
about enforcing it. My German friend warned that the fines were
``very, very steep, no slap on the hands, no warnings, no second
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   For me, it was the ultimate treat. Traveling at speeds in excess
of 110 mph, our little 170-horsepower Saab sprinted happily along,
once even legally passing a police car. What a rush!
</P>
<P>
   The system seems so sensible, and it's difficult to argue its
logic. Not once in more than 600 miles of driving did I see a
single accident or a tinge of animosity between drivers. If only we
could make it work on our far superior interstate highway system.

 &HT;    Test Drive: Malibu stacks up to imports
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Chevrolet likes to bill its Malibu sedan, a midsize
model larger than the Cavalier and smaller than the Lumina, as
``the car you knew America could build.'' The question that phrase
begs, naturally, is, ``Well, why did it take so long?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is equally obvious. After seeing so many midsize
buyers opt for Toyota Camrys, Honda Accords and other imports and
domestics, General Motors realized that generational loyalty and
the what-we-build-is-what-you-buy philosophy wasn't selling cars.
Voila -- here came the '97 Malibu sedan, a sensibly priced,
well-equipped, rather handsome car.
</P>
<P>
   Offered in base and LS trim and with two fairly disparate
engines, the Malibu wowed the critics and won buyers. Motor Trend
proclaimed it car of the year, Kiplinger's named it best in class
and best new car, and the cost-conscious American Automobile
Association tagged it best of class. The Malibu is basically
unchanged for '98, but it is Chevy's best-selling car with a
January-July 7 total of 80,075 vehicles sold.
</P>
<P>
   The base model, with a 150-horsepower four-cylinder engine and
automatic transmission, lists for $16,195. The slightly upscale
Malibu LS, with a 150-hp V-6 engine and automatic transmission, is
priced at $18,615. The ``sandrift metallic'' test Malibu totaled
$20,265, which included a sunroof ($595), power leather bucket
seats ($475), an upgraded stereo with CD and cassette players
($200), and the standard delivery charge ($525).
</P>
<P>
   Although its V-6 has the same 150 hp as the base Malibu's
four-cylinder engine, the tester clearly benefited from the V-6's
extra torque (180 pounds-feet at 3,200 rpm, compared with 155
pounds-feet at 4,400 rpm for the four-banger).
</P>
<P>
   The V-6 Malibu gets to 60 mph in about nine seconds, but,
perhaps more significant to the target market, its power anti-lock
disc brakes help it go from 60 mph to a stop in a very respectable
135 feet. The independent suspension certainly doesn't have a
sporty feel, but it handles nicely enough for a four-door weighing
3,100 pounds. The four-speed automatic shifted smoothly and -- if
the engine's goosed -- the shift points came high enough to provide
satisfactory acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality is that what's appealing about the Malibu is a
contemporary exterior and an interior that -- believe it or not --
shows the General is thinking about what buyers need and want: good
front seats, a satisfactory rear seat that folds down, air
conditioning, a tilt wheel, cruise control, power windows and
locks, rear vents, and lots of drink holders and storage spaces.
</P>
<P>
   You have to be left-handed to really appreciate the dash-mounted
drink holder to the left of the steering wheel, but some other nice
touches will appeal to right-handers as well. The trunk, plenty
large at 16 cubic feet, has a cargo net. The dash controls are easy
to reach and simple to operate, and there's no shortage of
visibility, headroom and legroom. Judged as the family car it's
supposed to be, the Malibu gives little reason for complaints,
although adults will find the integrated rear headrests are too
short to be of real use, the rear seat bottom is a bit short, and
both road and engine noise penetrate the cabin. Too bad traction
control is not available.
</P>
<P>
   It may have taken some time, but the Malibu, first introduced in
'64 as a Chevelle model and a rear-drive until '84, is a serious
import-fighter.
</P>

 &HT;    Donnie &AMP; Marie: a little bit corny, a little bit Springer
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The hair. The voice. The teeth. Oh, those
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, even at 40, Donny Osmond still resembles that oh-so-cute
pop music star that made young girls swoon in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a time when Osmond, a father of five boys,
desperately wanted to ditch that Tiger Beat persona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through a period where I really tried to change my
image,'' Osmond told a gathering of TV critics previewing the new
fall shows. ``I said, `I'm Donny Osmond, the grown-up guy.' But
then I realized I'm not. So you laugh at yourself and say, `Yes, I
wore purple socks. Yes, I sang ``Puppy Love'',' and it was a great
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Osmond hopes to relieve those great times with sister Marie when
``Donny &AMP; Marie,'' the duo's daytime talk/variety show debuts in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Donny and Marie are no strangers to variety shows.
The toothy brother-and-sister team hosted a music and comedy series
on ABC for four years in the mid-'70s.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot has changed in 20 years. The talk-show arena is more
competitive than ever and boasts a laundry list of failed Rosie
O'Donnell clones.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by Donny and Marie's painfully forced and seemingly
scripted presentation during which they needled each other about
age, maturity and nail biting, O'Donnell doesn't have much to worry
about.

   Does America really want to hear Marie calling Donny immature

``We're a different Donny and Marie,'' Marie promises. ``We're

   Quotes and stuff:
</P>
<P>
   _ Who could forget ``Hollywood Squares?'' Apparently some TV
writers, who kept asking Whoopi Goldberg, executive producer of a

</P>
<P>
   ``Will the celebrities or the contestants be in the boxes?''
asked one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, it's `Hollywood Squares','' she cracked. ``One would
assume that the Hollywood people would be in the boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Goldberg, who will sit in the center square, ``Even the
most dense of stars can come and play.'' That might not apply to
some TV writers.

 &HT;    Author lists books he'd love to write but won't
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman

<TEXT>
<P>
   Christopher Moore, author of ``Practical Demonkeeping'' and
``Island of the Sequined Love Nun,'' has turned his skewed brain to
the topic of Bestsellers I Never Wrote and come up with several
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: ``Return of a Man Called Newt,'' in which
disgruntled voters capture the Speaker of the House and torture him
mercilessly for 200 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``Dave Barry Turns State's Evidence,'' in which the
columnist testifies against a Cuban cocaine dealer and is forced
into the witness protection program, thereby giving other, fresher
writers a shot at the big time.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's most commercial idea, though, is ``Men are Homeless,
Women Got Mars in the Settlement,'' the true story of how the only
honest communication between the sexes comes through depositions.
</P>
<P>
   BOO! . . . Pineapple Press has published Joyce Moore's ``Haunt
Hunters Guide to Florida,'' a comprehensive tour of the state's
haunted houses. Included are the St. Augustine Lighthouse, the
Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables, the Daytona Playhouse in Daytona
Beach, and the Herlong Mansion in festive downtown Micanopy.
</P>
<P>
   I've spent a good deal of time at the Herlong Mansion and have
never seen anything beyond the realm of objective reality, but
maybe I'm just insensitive to ectoplasm.
</P>
<P>
   LOCAL AUTHOR CONTINUES TO MAKE GOOD . . . Ruth Turk of Lake
Worth, Fla., continues her series of biographical works for young
people with ``The Play's the Thing,'' the story of William
Shakespeare published by Carolrhoda Books. The book offers all the
facts and most of the drama, and the illustrations by Lisa Harvey
give a good sense of Elizabethan life.
</P>
<P>
   GLORIA IN EXCELSIS . . . One thing for which we have to thank
James Cameron _ possibly the only thing _ is returning Gloria
Stuart to the limelight she left more than 50 years ago. Little,
Brown has bought Stuart's autobiography which will be
rush-published this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Although the hook is her co-starring turn in ``Titanic,'' Stuart
has had a fascinating life: acting for James Whale and John Ford,
helping to found the Screen Actor's Guild, and a happy marriage to
Arthur Sheekman, one of the Marx Brothers' early writers.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart's book will be co-authored by cookbook writer Sylvia
Thompson, who happens to be her daughter.

 &HT;    Teaching children other languages gains popularity
 &HT;    By Julie Bonnin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Twice recently in a two-week period, parents planning
to relocate to the Austin area called the Round Rock Independent
School District to find out if Spanish is part of the elementary
level curriculum there.
</P>
<P>
   Not in Round Rock, where the idea was studied a couple of years
ago, but school officials decided against paying for it.
</P>
<P>
   Not in the Eanes Independent School District, which used to
offer Spanish to primary school students before dropping the
classes to save money.
</P>
<P>
   And not in the Austin Independent School District (with the
exception of four campuses, where parents or federal grants pay for
programs). After considering last month an ambitious plan that
would have put Spanish in all its elementary schools, AISD decided
that the costs were too high.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some local students _ those whose parents can afford it and
have made the effort to find or initiate programs _ are learning
foreign languages from Spanish to Chinese to Hebrew to Italian.
</P>
<P>
   Parents have as many reasons for wanting to get children
involved in a second language as there are dialects.
</P>
<P>
   They want to expose them to a variety of cultures _ to learn
more about their own family heritage, or to expand a world view. Or
they want to be sure their children have the advantage of
multilanguage fluency in an increasingly global world. Learning a
second language is even being used as a tactic for slowing down
hyperactive children.
</P>
<P>
   Kids are also (gasp) taking foreign languages just for fun of
it, or for the stunningly obvious reason of being better able to
communicate with a growing number of Spanish-speaking Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Priscilla Lozano helped initiate an after-school Spanish program
at Matthews Elementary School in Austin. Lozano's daughter, Caitlin
O'Hanlon, 7, had taken Spanish in preschool and Lozano wanted her
to continue learning. ``I'm Hispanic,'' Lozano says. ``At home when
I was growing up, my parents were concerned if we learned Spanish
first, our English wouldn't be as strong. So I don't speak Spanish
very well. I think it's part of the culture that's lost. In Texas,
it's crazy if you don't try everything you can to learn Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Research that's found children learn foreign languages easier
when lessons start early is also helping to drive a trend toward
younger foreign language instruction. Children in other countries
for years have been routinely schooled in more than one language,
but in the United States the idea is only now beginning to catch
on.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 31 percent of all public and private schools offered
a foreign language to elementary-school-age children, a 22 percent
increase over 10 years ago, according to the Center for Applied
Linguistics in Washington, D.C. (Twenty-four percent of public
schools offered a foreign language in 1997, compared withto 17
percent a decade ago).
</P>
<P>
   ``There aresome very pragmatic reasons why one should start
foreign languages early in life,'' says Ed Scebold, director of the
American Council of Teachers of Foreign Languages.
</P>
<P>
   Children, Scebold says, have the ability to acquire
pronunciation skills they often lose as they grow older. And, as is
true with English, ``One doesn't learn a language in a couple of
years, he saysadds. ``If you're talking about competence, you need
a lengthy sequence of learning. There needs to be a continuous
stream of learning the language.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine K. Horwitz is director of the University of Texas Foreign
Language Program, which prepares foreign language teachers and
teacher trainers. She thinks it's great for children to learn
another language, but that the idea that they have to start early a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want parents to think that if (their children) have
missed these early years, it's impossible for them to learn a
foreign language,'' Horwitz says. ``That if they haven't done it by
5 or 6, they've blown it. We're even seeing a rebirth in senior
citizens learning foreign language.''
</P>
<P>
   But many parents want their children to learn early and are
taking advantage of programs. Preschools bring in teachers who
focus on Spanish-language songs, rhymes and simple words, or
integrate Spanish in classrooms with Spanish-speaking teachers and
children.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to interested parents like Lozano, extracurricular
Spanish is offered after school at several elementary campuses in
the Eanes, Austin and Round Rock school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Many private schools offer a second language as a part of the
curriculum for primary grade students. There are private tutors and
foreign language schools who will work with children one-on-one or
in groups. Costs vary widely, from college student tutors at the
low end of the scale to private schools that charge more than $300
for a five-week session. Somewhere mid-range is onrisas Spanish
School, which charges $50 a month for twice weekly preschool
classes and a little more for the after-school classes it leads on
elementary campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Will occasional, or even a year's worth of lessons, really
benefit children later in life?
</P>
<P>
   ``What it might do is pique an interest, foster positive
attitudes toward language and culture,'' Horwitz says. ``If you're
talking about two half-hour sessions for 12 weeks, they might pick
up some songs and phrases, but they're not going to speak a lot of
the language.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether a parent speaks the language at home can make a huge
difference. And there are all kinds of ways to support a child's
interest in another language, especially if it's Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Besides books, audiotapes and videos that can enhance Spanish
language skills, there are Spanish-language shows on television.
Churches, schools and parks that attract lots of Spanish-speaking
children can be great resources, Horwitz says.
</P>
<P>
   Older children who can write can get involved with pen pals or
correspond with native speakers on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As for classes, Horwitz suggests staying away from those that
stress vocabulary words and grammar analysis. ``What you want is
immersion,'' she says. That means the teacher and children speak in
the target language as kids take part in lots of age-appropriate
activities: art, outdoor play, cooking, etc. Jerry Straubel of
Spanish Language Instruction prefers teaching parents and children
simultaneously, so that parents can reinforce what the kids learn
in class by speaking Spanish at home.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching groups of children years ago, he says, ``was a total
disaster. Because the parents would then say in pristine English
when they got home, 'How was your Spanish class today?' If they
(children) don't see language as a communication tool, they're
going to put it aside with the rest of the toys.''
</P>
<P>
   Straubel will be teaching Lisa Kaufman and her 2-year-old son,
Ned, in a few months, after her son's English-speaking skills
improve some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the demographics change, I think it (knowing Spanish) will
be important for him,'' Kaufman says. ``I think it makes you more
well rounded; it makes you a better sort of partner in the world.
And I think it's probably a lot easier to learn as a child than as
an adult.''

   WEST PALM BEACH _ They talked about sex. They talked about
money.
</P>
<P>
   They talked about children, work, recreation and
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   They talked about talking _ to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Bethany and Mike Bishop of Palm Beach Gardens were getting
married. They had work to do.
</P>
<P>
   So, they signed up for eight two-hour counseling sessions with
their pastor before the wedding in April last year.
</P>
<P>
   They prayed together, discovered things about each other they
didn't know and found their love language. That's the particular
way each one expresses affection _ and wants it expressed.
</P>
<P>
   They learned that Christian marriage is a threesome. God must be
a part of the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the world gives you a good idea of what marriage
is,'' said Bethany Bishop, 27, a member of Palm Beach Gardens
Christ Fellowship. ``You kind of go into this saying, `This is like
a movie. This is like my parents. What is this like?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Most clergy say couples will not know what marriage is really
like until they have been married for a year or longer.
</P>
<P>
   Many recommend that newlyweds have marital checkups with a
counselor after six months of marriage and again near their first
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   But they insist that serious preparation is critical for the
success of many marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Premarital instruction often seems a waste of time to couples
who are convinced that love conquers all, but more than half of all
marriages end in divorce. And many couples remain in painful, even
abusive, relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The hard work of getting to know one another before you say ``I
do'' is worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the state of Florida has discovered what clergy have long
known. In June, Gov. Lawton Chiles signed the Marriage Preparation
and Preservation Act.
</P>
<P>
   The law _ which will take effect next Jan. 1 _ encourages
premarital counseling and requires counseling before parents can be
divorced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great step by the state to put more emphasis on
marriage preparation,'' said the Rev. Timothy Lynch, pastor of Mary
Immaculate Roman Catholic Church in West Palm Beach. ``There is a
direct bearing on marriage stability predicated on preparation at
the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The law urges couples to have four hours of marriage instruction
with a minister or competent counselor. If they do that, they save
$32.50 of the $88.50 cost of a license. Otherwise, they pay full
price and must wait three days to get the license.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who file for divorce must take a four-hour divorce
education course.
</P>
<P>
   That might make parents more sensitive to the likely suffering
that divorce brings to kids. And it might encourage them to work on
saving the marriage, according to Henry Virkler. He is a professor
of psychology who teaches counseling at Palm Beach Atlantic College
in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The law is one of the first of its kind in the country, Virkler
said. And it requires that Florida high schools include courses on
marriage and relationships as part of their life management
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We teach kids all sorts of things, but we don't educate them
for marriage,'' Virkler said. ``Consequently, half of all marriages
end in divorce with untold pain for the adults and incredible
problems for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Wisk, 43, knows some of that pain. Her first marriage
ended in divorce. She was from the Philippines. Her husband was
not. There were cultural differences. They had different ideas
about marriage, but they had no marriage counseling and no way to
anticipate and resolve problems.
</P>
<P>
   She prepared carefully for her second marriage in April. She and
her fiance, George, had eight two-hour sessions with the associate
pastor, the Rev. Brian Benjamin, at Christ Fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   They took a psychological inventory that can pinpoint
personality traits, measure hopes and fears and provide fodder for
discussion. They talked about money, making decisions and trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn to communicate,'' said Wisk, who is from Jupiter.
``The sessions become an open communication where you actually talk
without fear of hearing, `Why do you ask that kind of question?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Most Christian denominations do not officially require
premarital counseling, but most ministers do.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin advises couples to allow four months. He convenes
groups of six or seven couples for eight weekly two-hour sessions.
He also meets privately as many as four times with each couple.
</P>
<P>
   He blends marital counseling with spiritual teaching. Couples
have books to read, tapes to hear, homework to do and
questionnaires to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of hard work,'' said Mike Bishop, 28. ``It's a
chance to get things out in the open and get your eyes focused on
the fact that God brought you together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic Church requires four to six months of
preparation, Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   Each parish has its own program. But most include taking a
psychological inventory _ of more than 150 questions _ that
measures various areas of compatibility, Lynch said. The results
are used for discussion. Couples are also expected to attend a
group program called ``engaged encounter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a one-day workshop in which they benefit from the
insight of married couples as well as professionals in marriage and
family life,'' Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish synagogues are not required to offer premarital
counseling, but most rabbis encourage some degree of marriage
preparation. Many have demanding programs, according to Rabbi
Stephen Pinsky at Temple Beth Torah in Wellington.
</P>
<P>
   The Koran has extensive guidelines that govern Muslim courtship,
engagement and marriage, according to Ibrahim Hooper of the Council
on American Islamic Relations in Washington. But many Muslim
leaders offer marriage preparation as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most clergy believe counseling after the wedding is also
critically important.
</P>
<P>
   It's harder to solve problems when the couple are married,
according to the Rev. Horace Ward, who is pastor of Maranatha
Church in Palm Beach Gardens and has a doctorate in counseling from
Ohio State University.
</P>
<P>
   After the wedding, couples discover things about each other they
didn't know and don't like. Egos are hurt. Resentment and fear
replace trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very dangerous time, when they fall off their
pedestal and before we discover we have fallen off ours,'' Ward
said.
</P>
<P>
   He requires that couples complete a six-week group course and
have several individual meetings with him before the wedding. But
he wants them to know help is always available.
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of the premarital process, Ward gives each
couple his business card. Keep it in a safe place, he tells them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am asking you to make a lifetime commitment to each other,''
he says. ``I am making a lifetime commitment to you.''
</P>
<P>
   DO HOMEWORK BEFORE SAYING `I DO'
</P>
<P>
   Most denominations urge but do not require marital preparation.
But most clergy insist on some preparation.
</P>
<P>
   That may amount to as little as two informal meetings or as many
as a dozen highly structured sessions over several months.
</P>
<P>
   One example of a solid premarital education format would include
six sessions and about 50 hours of homework.
</P>
<P>
   The couple would take as many as three psychological
inventories:
</P>
<P>
   One identifies what each brings to the marriage from his or her
family of origin.
</P>
<P>
   The second measures how they see themselves and each other.
</P>
<P>
   The third measures 11 areas in the marriage relationship,
including expectations, communications skills, financial
management, sexuality and spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   The couple would read as many as five books on the mystery and
management of married life and listen to two series of audio tapes
on sex and money.
</P>
<P>
   Topics discussed in sessions include: why the couple wants to be
married, their personalities and how they mesh with one another,
finance and budgets, sexual relations, children, family planning
and spiritual life.

<P>
   IN FLORIDA, A COURSE TO GET A DIVORCE
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Marriage Preparation and Preservation Act was signed
into law in June. The law includes:
</P>
<P>
   1. A recommendation that all couples take a four-hour premarital
education course from a clergyman, therapist or qualified
instructor. They save $32.50 of the $88.50 cost of a marriage
license. Otherwise, they must wait three days for the license and
pay the full cost.
</P>
<P>
   2. Florida high schools must offer a course in marriage and
relationship skills as part of life management classes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Couples with children who file for divorce must take a
four-hour divorce education course to help sensitize parents to the
pain of divorce for them and their children. The court fee for
divorce papers was raised $32.50 to $200.
</P>
<P>
   4. The state is directed to develop a handbook of the rights and
responsibilities of marriage to be given to all couples who apply
for a marriage license.
</P>
<P>
   5. Florida State University is directed take the relationship
very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   RED FLAGS
</P>
<P>
   Proceed with caution if your relationship includes:
</P>
<P>
   Personality differences.
</P>
<P>
   They may attract when you date, but, in marriage, differences
often lead to divorce. An introvert may be attracted to an
extrovert, or a messy person may be attracted to a clean person -
but over time, it may require more and more energy to put up with
those differences.
</P>
<P>
   A partner who seems overly eager to be married.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors suspect that an over-eager person may be running from
something, or he or she may be aware of problems and may want to
hook the other person into marriage before the problems become
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   A partner who has unrealistic expectations of the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   We all go into marriage with some unrealistic expectation. The
danger is when one partner expects the other to meet all physical
and emotional needs.
</P>
<P>
   A partner who must control the relationship and have his or her
way in all things. This is a sign of unrealistic expectations - or
a serious behavioral problem.
</P>
<P>
   A partner who has a behavioral or psychological problem.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes people, especially young women, believe their love
will heal a mate's bad behavior. Love does not conquer all. The
better choice is to make sure the future spouse works through the
problem before marriage.
</P>
<P>
   A partner who is reluctant to talk about his or her feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Again, self-awareness and honesty are key to happy marriage. If
we're not aware of our feelings, we're likely to act them out
rather than talking them through. Acted-out feelings often drive
wedges between people.

</P>
<P>
   HOW'S YOUR MARRIAGE?
</P>
<P>
   Ask yourself these questions
</P>
<P>
   Mark each question either SA (Strongly Agree), A (Agree), N
(Neutral), D (Disagree), SD (Strongly Disagree).
</P>
<P>
   1. For the most part, I like my partner's personality.
</P>
<P>
   2. I can share my feelings comfortably and openly with my
partner.
</P>
<P>
   3. I am satisfied with how openly my partner shares his or her
feelings with me.
</P>
<P>
   4. When we have a difference of opinion, I believe we have ways
of finding solutions that leave both of us feeling satisfied and
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   5. I am satisfied with the way we express caring and non-sexual
affection in our relationship.
</P>
<P>
   6. I am satisfied with our sexual life.
</P>
<P>
   7. I feel comfortable with the way we spend our money and make
financial decisions.
</P>
<P>
   8. I am satisfied with the leisure activities that we do
together.
</P>
<P>
   Compare your answers with your partner's answers. Use the
results to talk about your relationship.
</P>
<P>
   DISCUSSION TIP:
</P>
<P>
   Use ``I'' and ``It'' statements when talking about your
marriage. Avoid using ``You'' statements. For example: ``I feel
that we do not spend enough time together'' is better than ``You
never spend any time with me.'' ``I am angry that you did not clean
the house'' is better than ``You're a slob, you never clean up
after yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ADVICE:
</P>
<P>
   Couples should focus on events and issues instead of
personalities,'' says the Rev. Horace Ward, pastor of Maranatha
Church in Palm Beach Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   If talking about these issues becomes difficult, check with your
pastor, rabbi or a marriage and family therapist sooner rather than
later.

   FOUNDED in 1993 by Vietnam-era radio host, actress and model
Chris Noel. A private, nonprofit organization, Vetsville is one of
only two programs in Palm Beach County that caters specifically to
homeless veterans, according to the county housing department. (The
other is the VA Medical Center.)
</P>
<P>
   SHELTERS: Two homes in Riviera Beach, one in Boynton Beach and
an apartment complex in West Palm Beach. Another is expected to be
added in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ANNUAL BUDGET: Most recently, $95,000.
</P>
<P>
   PAYS FOR upkeep of the homes, mortgages, food and clothing. No
salaries. Staff, including Noel, works for free.
</P>
<P>
   SERVICES: Besides food, clothes and shelter, Vetsville helps
residents seek medical care, apply for benefits and find work if
they are able. If they are unable to work, residents are assigned
low-pressure jobs at the shelter, such as sorting clothes for the
thrift shop, caring for pets and watering the tropical garden.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY COMES FROM private donations from groups such as the
American Legion, thrift shop sales and fund-raisers. Last year, the
county Department of Housing and Community Development awarded
Vetsville a $25,000 federal grant.
</P>
<P>
   STAFF: Except for Chris Noel, the homes are managed and cared
for by the otherwise-homeless veterans they serve.
</P>
<P>
   ADMISSIONS: Vetsville accepts honorably discharged veterans and
their families who have recovered or are recovering from drug and
alcohol addiction.
</P>
<P>
   WISH LIST: Noel hates to ask, but . . . They need air
conditioning, plywood and insulation, instruments for music
therapy, dog and cat food for pet therapy. They could use the
services of a painter, carpenter and plumber.
</P>
<P>
   FOR MORE INFORMATION, call Vetsville House at (561) 533-5797.

 &HT;    When the boys are ready to come home again, Vetsville is waiting
 &HT;    By Dale Fuchs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ ``Mad Dog,'' recently released from the VA
hospital, baked the Smithfield Virginia ham. A Vietnam vet who just
kicked a drug habit made the sweet potato pie.
</P>
<P>
   Here, try some, the guys insist. One of the men will run inside
and get you a fork and a soda to wash it all down.
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to the butterfly garden, a husky man frowns at a
wine bottle filled with clear, yellow liquid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only olive oil!'' says another man, who appears to be in
charge. Phew. At Vetsville Cease Fire House for homeless veterans,
``no alcohol'' is one of the 33 rules one must follow _ or be
kicked out.
</P>
<P>
   The radio is playing oldies from the '60s. Watches are set to
military time. American flags wave above the blue-trimmed house on
McIntosh Street where, inside the garden, behind a white picket
fence, a couple dozen otherwise-homeless veterans are celebrating
the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1800 hours, and the Vetsville gang is smoking and eating
and _ with some command-and-control from shelter founder (and
former magazine cover girl) Chris Noel _ managing to clean up.
</P>
<P>
   Here you'll meet the newcomers, such as Vietnam veteran Chuck
Shaylor, 52, who showed up at the West Palm Beach shelter two weeks
ago with his life's possessions in a shopping cart. Firm handshake.
Shaylor didn't eat much this evening; he still has trouble holding
down all this good food after going so many days without.
</P>
<P>
   And here are some longtime residents, such as Jim A. Wilson,
37-year-old ex-Marine. He used to sleep beneath bridges before he
finally dried out and became a manager at this shelter five months
ago. Now he's very busy. He took a break from designing the
Vetsville Web Page to join the festivities. The guys say he's great
on the guitar.
</P>
<P>
   There is Richard Patrick Bennett. He's 47. Used to be a gunner
in the Army, got a Purple Heart in 'Nam. He's a bit withdrawn _ the
metal plate in his head might have something to do with it _ but
when you get him talking, he can tell you all about what happened
to him in the summer of 1970. And before he lights the cigarette,
he'll ask in a gentle voice, ``Do you mind?''
</P>
<P>
   James ``Bob'' Laycock, 52, has been living in a Vetsville
apartment for three years. He worked in Naval Security, but don't
ask him what he did. Apologetic smile. It's classified information,
he says. Can't divulge it, not even three decades later. He gave
his oath. Laycock's a solitary man, a Hemingway fan, and he'd
rather be watching the Texas Rangers on TV. But he'll tear himself
away to meet a visitor.
</P>
<P>
   These are Chris Noel's men.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who don't have dogtags, Noel was the blond
bombshell behind the Armed Forces Radio show ``A Date with Chris''
that heartened U.S. soldiers in Vietnam. Her green, almond-shaped
eyes and toothpaste-ad smile used to appear in magazines and motion
pictures in the '60s and '70s. Since then, she's written a book,
appeared on a dozen sitcoms and hit the talk show circuit: ``Merv
Griffin,'' ``Joe Franklin,'' ``The Tonight Show.''
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the glitz was sorrow. Her first husband, a Green
Beret in Vietnam, shot himself in the head on Christmas of '69. He
was 27. She blames his death on post-traumatic stress disorder. His
death fueled her desire to help other veterans: She couldn't bear
to see them in so much pain, she says.
</P>
<P>
   So she traveled around the world telling people about things
such as ``survival guilt'' and ``panic attacks.'' And then she
returned to the place where she grew up, Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 22, 1993, she opened the first Vetsville Cease Fire
House, a pair of three-bedroom cottages in Riviera Beach. Five
years later, Vetsville has expanded to four homes, all managed by
the veterans themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 10 months alone, 306 honorably discharged servicemen
(Vetsville checks their papers) have sought refuge at Noel's
shelter doors. Many struggle with illness or injury. Most suffer
from post-traumatic stress disorder and have recovered from an
addiction, Noel says.
</P>
<P>
   Noel, now 57, sometimes mothers them, but most often she
``tough-loves'' them: If they break curfew at 2200 hours, that's
one strike. If their rooms fail inspection, that's another strike.
Three strikes and they must leave.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes, you get only one strike before you're out. If a
resident wants to take up drugs or drink again, for instance,
there's no negotiation: ``I say, `If you want to be out with crack,
then go,' '' Noel says. ``If you want help, stay here. Kicking this
thing is harder than anything you ever did in Vietnam. Bite that
bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few months at Vetsville, some residents find jobs and
rent apartments on their own, but Noel doesn't keep track of how
many. She feeds, clothes and houses them, and gives them something
to do: To her, that is success enough.
</P>
<P>
   There are 3,090 homeless people in Palm Beach County _ about one
third of them veterans, according the most recent government
survey. Vetsville, with shelters in Riviera Beach, Boynton Beach
and West Palm Beach, can house altogether only 45 people at one
time.
</P>
<P>
   But Noel says she doesn't like to think in terms of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me angry,'' she says, ``like the body counts in
Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   The point of Vetsville, she says, ``is to stop the statistics,
to take care of the individual, to make them the best they can
be.''
</P>
<P>
   So if you want to understand this organization, she says, forget
numbers and talk to the men.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of the stories that they told:
</P>
<P>
   Another night of partying _ just liquor, no drugs _ and Jim
Wilson wakes up beneath the Blue Heron Bridge. This time, though,
he takes stock of his 36-year-long life:
</P>
<P>
   Lost the wife. Lost the girlfriend. Left them both for a
``20-year love affair with the bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just give me a few days to straighten myself out,'' he had
begged the women. ``I'll be back.'' But he never came back, and he
knows they weren't crazy enough to stick around even if he did.
</P>
<P>
   No sir, Jim Wilson didn't stick around any one place too long.
He joined the Marines, left the Marines, joined again, left for
good with the rank of sergeant. Managed to keep making love to that
bottle of vodka, even in uniform. Knows if you're smart enough, you
can get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   And Jim Wilson sure is smart, so for a long time, he got away
with it: when he worked as a paramedic, when he drifted around the
country, when he landed a technician's job at a manufacturing plant
in Riviera Beach.
</P>
<P>
   That's when events really started getting blurry: He ``screwed
up'' at the plant, so he quit. Stopped paying bills at his friend's
house, so he left.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, he would say he was ``having trouble assimilating''
into civilian society.
</P>
<P>
   So he started sleeping in the parks, John D. MacArthur, John
Prince. He could make it ``in the wild.'' In fact, he felt more
comfortable in the wild, didn't he? He was trained as a Marine,
after all, a damn-tough, backbone-of-our-fighting-force'' Marine.
</P>
<P>
   And so on this particular day, he wakes up beneath the bridge
with the rest of the regulars down there, stumbles over to a nearby
gas station and looks in the mirror. The man looking back is
``pushing that ZZ-top look.'' His beard is gnarly and long, his
camouflage pants, ratty. He's got ``dead man's eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's when it hits him: This man is going to die. He breaks
off the affair with the bottle ``cold turkey.'' Four days later, he
slings his red bag over his back and walks about 7 miles to
Vetsville Cease Fire House in West Palm Beach. It's been five
months now since he arrived. He shares a neat two-bedroom apartment
with this plaque at the door: ``When you think you're going to go
over the edge, God in his infinite wisdom made the world round.''
</P>
<P>
   He's the shelter's general manager. Works all day, no salary.
Does everything from bookkeeping to writing grants. Laughs about
his old, errant ways. Now that he's straight, he says they offered
him his old job back at the Riviera Beach plant. But he won't take
it. He needs the structure here, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Ever think about drinking?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too busy helping these guys, training on the computer,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my turn to say, `I'm Jim, and I'm going to help you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't believe it,'' the middle-aged man says as his son
drops him off at the Salvation Army shelter in West Palm Beach,
handing him a $20.
</P>
<P>
   James Robert Laycock, age ``54 going on a hundred,'' had seen
hard times before. He worked in Naval Security from '63 to '67, and
that had not been easy. Make a mistake, and it could cost you ``big
time,'' as in ``an international incident.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when his panic disorder started _ a terror that would
send him bolting from a room of people and could seize him at any
time. It cost him his job as a sales manager, he says, and after,
his job as a church custodian. It certainly didn't help his failing
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   He had had surgery on his back and neck, too, and that made him
unfit for manual labor.
</P>
<P>
   But he never thought would come to this: A $5-per-night cot at
the Salvation Army, a room shared with 20 other men, wake-up at
4:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   In a few days, he falls into the routine. He wakes at 3:30 a.m.
to bathe and shave before the early morning rush. He leaves his ID
at the door and walks to the mall. Or wherever. He just keeps
walking. He knows the score: ``Stop and they'll get you.'' ``They''
are the police.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other men try to teach him to panhandle. So he
approaches a man at the nearby McDonald's, pretending he needs
money for a phone call. The man won't give him any.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did I get into this mess?'' he asks himself. ``It's no way
to live.''
</P>
<P>
   On his 10th day at the Salvation Army, he meets a church deacon
who calls Chris Noel. A week before Thanksgiving 1995, Noel
welcomes him to Vetsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was in the Hyatt Regency,'' he recalls three years
later, comfy in the apartment he shares with his pet beagle Daisy.
Here, he has a garden to water, steps to sweep and other jobs Noel
assigns him.
</P>
<P>
   He is wearing sunglasses _ indoors _ but behind them, he says,
tears are coming to his eyes. They well up every time he remembers
that first time he met Noel. ``I started crying,'' he says. ``If I
could have, I would have married her.''
</P>
<P>
   The jungle is quiet. Richard Bennett can hear the chatter of
monkeys and the crack of the occasional machete as it chops through
bamboo.
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, when a damn B-52 flies over the dense canopy
and drops one _ or many. Then the hot, moist air fills with sound
of bombs exploding, and Bennett feels his muscles tighten. Then,
the bomber passes, and the jungle is quiet again.
</P>
<P>
   The year is 1970, and Bennett, then 18, is a foot soldier, an
``M-79 gunner,'' in the northern reaches of the South Vietnamese
jungle, near the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
</P>
<P>
   He cuts an impressive figure: 6-feet tall and 180 pounds _ ``240
pounds with my pack.'' His blue eyes are not yet dulled by
depression or medication; they are alive.
</P>
<P>
   How did he wind up here? His father had been a Marine. So had
his older brothers. But what was Bennett doing right after high
school graduation? Working at a gas station. No plans for college.
On the 6 o'clock news, though, he watched battle scenes from
Vietnam. Interviews with proud American soldiers. The Americans, it
had seemed, were winning.
</P>
<P>
   So Bennett had made a decision: He would serve his country, earn
his college tuition and go through basic training with his best
friend. He had joined the Army's 101st Airborne Division. At 18,
how was he to know about the stench of 30 corpses he would have to
stuff into body bags? About the nightmares that would haunt him
decades later? About six different anxiety-calming drugs?
</P>
<P>
   Could he have guessed that one day, he would cringe, as though
expecting pain, when the woman he adored, his ex-wife, crept up
behind him to give him a hug? What could he have done differently
if he had known that, at age 45, he would be too broke to rent a
room, too medicated to drive or work a machine?
</P>
<P>
   No, on this day in the South Vietnamese jungle, Bennett can not
guess the future. He takes off his helmet and rests a second beside
a tree. He is sweating, as always. His mouth is dry, as always. His
pack is heavy, as always. In the distance, he sees the treetops
dead from Agent Orange. . .
</P>
<P>
   Then drops the bomb that will bury shrapnel in the back of his
head and send Bennett home with four medals and a Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
   And then, a decade later, comes the depression, the anxiety and
the nightmares _ what is now known as ``post-traumatic stress
disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Bennett quits Job 1, as a truck driver: ``Couldn't drive
with all that medication. . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Then he quits Job 2 as a security guard: ``Can't be around too
many people. . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1996 his mother sells the family home in Port St. Lucie,
and Bennett has no place else to stay, so while waiting for his
first $700-a-month disability checks from the U.S. government to
come, he knocks on the door of Vetsville Cease Fire House. And
Chris Noel opens it, and gives Bennett something to eat and a
bedroom to sleep in and a small job to do around the house. And
when he wants to talk, she listens to his stories.

 &HT;    Be kind to your car: Buy good gasoline
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Gasoline is a hot topic these days. Three readers
have fuel-related questions, two about fuel quality and one about
gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   Let's tackle the confusion about fuel first.
</P>
<P>
   David Harris writes: ``I take excellent care of our three cars
(change the oil every 2,500 miles, etc.), but I buy the cheapest
gasoline I can find. How do I determine which fuel is a
good-quality fuel?''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially all gasoline, no matter where it comes from, must go
through the same process to get it from crude oil to a combustible
fuel. Further refinement of this fuel produces what is commonly
referred to as either ``regular'' or ``premium'' gasoline, which is
only a rating of the fuel's ability to resist knock.
</P>
<P>
   Either the refiner or the retailer determines the differences
between the fuel quality, which depends on the special chemicals
added to the base fuel. Additives include detergents for the
control of deposits, corrosion inhibitors and antioxidants, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say Fish Oil Co. is a large refiner and retailer of
gasoline. The gasoline in its storage tanks is the basically the
same as that of Olive Oil Co., another refiner.
</P>
<P>
   When the tanker truck fills up with Fish Oil fuel for delivery
to its own stations, a special additive package that ``won't clog
fuel injectors and keeps the inside of your engine sparkling
clean'' is mixed with the fuel in the truck before it is delivered
to Fish Oil retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The Olive Oil distributors use a similar ``clean and healthy
engine'' additive package for their Olive Oil service stations.
</P>
<P>
   Zoom Co. has a large chain of quickie marts/gas stations. It
buys its fuel from the lowest bidder and adds it own ``we guarantee
our gas'' package to the gasoline it sells.
</P>
<P>
   Snake Oil Co., a small independent chain of stations
specializing in cheap gasoline, also buys the least expensive fuel.
</P>
<P>
   However, to keep prices low, this company doesn't use an
additive package. Snake Oil gas is 10 cents a gallon cheaper than
Fish or Olive Oil gas and 5 cents less than Zoom, but that savings
will be short-lived by the customer.
</P>
<P>
   Without the benefit of the fuel additives, a car -- especially
if it is fuel injected -- is more likely to develop the
driveability problems all of those chemicals were designed to
eliminate. Combustion chamber deposits, varnish buildup on fuel
injectors, fuel system component corrosion and PCV valve gook are
the most common.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when a person is experiencing poor engine performance,
the first question I ask is: ``Where are you buying your gas?''
</P>
<P>
   The pat reply I hear is: ``With the money I save in gas, I can
buy those bottles of gas cleaner stuff they sell at auto parts
stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong answer. Excessive use of these products can damage fuel
systems. Not enough and you have the same cheap-gas problems as
before. If you are a chemical engineer, you may be able to arrive
at the right formula, but personally, I don't want to think that
hard.
</P>
<P>
   Good-quality gasoline contains an additive package and is sold
at reputable, high-volume retailers. Some will even supply you with
information on the additives and their benefits, if you ask. Don't
take chances with your car's fuel system. Buy good gas.

 &HT;    German autobahns can teach us lessons
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- It was like a brief trip into automotive heaven. As a
driving enthusiast, the mere mention of the German autobahns has
been like a vision of sugarplums dancing in my head.
</P>
<P>
   It truly was Christmas in July during a trip to Germany. I
jumped at the opportunity when my German-born traveling companion
offered the opportunity to take a turn behind the steering wheel on
her vehicle, a 1999 four-cylinder Saab 9-5 with a light turbo.
</P>
<P>
   Almost coyishly, I asked, ``How fast can I go?''
</P>
<P>
   Her reply: ``As fast as you want; there is no speed limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Her answer was pure symphony music to my ears.
</P>
<P>
   Our trip to Hamburg was roughly 225 miles. Under good
circumstances, we should have made the journey in a little over two
hours. The entire trip was not smooth going.
</P>
<P>
   True, there is no speed limit on the remote stretches of the
autobahns, but the Germans wisely impose speed limits in congested
or populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   The system works with marvelous efficiency. Drivers do not ride
along in the left lane except to pass. Everyone knows the rules: If
you see a car approaching behind you, it is your responsibility to
give way and move to the right lane.
</P>
<P>
   The approaching vehicles don't tailgate. There is no need. If
they close on a vehicle in front of them, they slow some 10 car
lengths or better behind the other vehicle to allow it to move
safely out of the way. On our trip, I saw only one incident in
which the approaching driver blinked his lights as a friendly
reminder to the vehicle ahead to give way.
</P>
<P>
   My companion's comment: ``It must be a tourist. They obviously
don't know the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Our trip was delayed by a seven-mile traffic jam in Bremen. The
autobahn had expanded from two to four lanes. Changeable
illuminated overhead signs posted a speed limit of 60 kmh (about 37
mph) and indicated, via international symbols, congestion ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great time to ``window shop'' in the Germany automotive
``toy store.'' You see many brands of vehicle that are not imported
into the United States -- Fiats, Alfa Romeos, Opels, Vauxhalls,
Citroens and a multitude of models produced by familiar makers that
we also never see. Among them were Mercedes E320s pulling horse
trailers, Ford Modeos (Contours here) cruising down the byway with
a travel trailer in tow and a host of vehicles laden with bicycles.
An American conversion van and a Toyota Land Cruiser seemed out of
place.
</P>
<P>
   The most amazing sight was that in spite of an almost hour delay
in the traffic jam, nobody seemed to get excited. The pace was very
calm and laid back. Perhaps because they knew when they finally
cleared the construction delay, they could make up the time. That
is part of the reason the autobahn system works.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that the Germans take driving very seriously and
require extensive training before granting a driver a license. They
make sure everyone plays by the same rules. Another is that where
there is a speed limit posted, they are serious -- very serious --
about enforcing it. My German friend warned that the fines were
``very, very steep, no slap on the hands, no warnings, no second
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   For me, it was the ultimate treat. Traveling at speeds in excess
of 110 mph, our little 170-horsepower Saab sprinted happily along,
once even legally passing a police car. What a rush!
</P>
<P>
   The system seems so sensible, and it's difficult to argue its
logic. Not once in more than 600 miles of driving did I see a
single accident or a tinge of animosity between drivers. If only we
could make it work on our far superior interstate highway system.

 &HT;    Test Drive: Malibu stacks up to imports
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Chevrolet likes to bill its Malibu sedan, a midsize
model larger than the Cavalier and smaller than the Lumina, as
``the car you knew America could build.'' The question that phrase
begs, naturally, is, ``Well, why did it take so long?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is equally obvious. After seeing so many midsize
buyers opt for Toyota Camrys, Honda Accords and other imports and
domestics, General Motors realized that generational loyalty and
the what-we-build-is-what-you-buy philosophy wasn't selling cars.
Voila -- here came the '97 Malibu sedan, a sensibly priced,
well-equipped, rather handsome car.
</P>
<P>
   Offered in base and LS trim and with two fairly disparate
engines, the Malibu wowed the critics and won buyers. Motor Trend
proclaimed it car of the year, Kiplinger's named it best in class
and best new car, and the cost-conscious American Automobile
Association tagged it best of class. The Malibu is basically
unchanged for '98, but it is Chevy's best-selling car with a
January-July 7 total of 80,075 vehicles sold.
</P>
<P>
   The base model, with a 150-horsepower four-cylinder engine and
automatic transmission, lists for $16,195. The slightly upscale
Malibu LS, with a 150-hp V-6 engine and automatic transmission, is
priced at $18,615. The ``sandrift metallic'' test Malibu totaled
$20,265, which included a sunroof ($595), power leather bucket
seats ($475), an upgraded stereo with CD and cassette players
($200), and the standard delivery charge ($525).
</P>
<P>
   Although its V-6 has the same 150 hp as the base Malibu's
four-cylinder engine, the tester clearly benefited from the V-6's
extra torque (180 pounds-feet at 3,200 rpm, compared with 155
pounds-feet at 4,400 rpm for the four-banger).
</P>
<P>
   The V-6 Malibu gets to 60 mph in about nine seconds, but,
perhaps more significant to the target market, its power anti-lock
disc brakes help it go from 60 mph to a stop in a very respectable
135 feet. The independent suspension certainly doesn't have a
sporty feel, but it handles nicely enough for a four-door weighing
3,100 pounds. The four-speed automatic shifted smoothly and -- if
the engine's goosed -- the shift points came high enough to provide
satisfactory acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality is that what's appealing about the Malibu is a
contemporary exterior and an interior that -- believe it or not --
shows the General is thinking about what buyers need and want: good
front seats, a satisfactory rear seat that folds down, air
conditioning, a tilt wheel, cruise control, power windows and
locks, rear vents, and lots of drink holders and storage spaces.
</P>
<P>
   You have to be left-handed to really appreciate the dash-mounted
drink holder to the left of the steering wheel, but some other nice
touches will appeal to right-handers as well. The trunk, plenty
large at 16 cubic feet, has a cargo net. The dash controls are easy
to reach and simple to operate, and there's no shortage of
visibility, headroom and legroom. Judged as the family car it's
supposed to be, the Malibu gives little reason for complaints,
although adults will find the integrated rear headrests are too
short to be of real use, the rear seat bottom is a bit short, and
both road and engine noise penetrate the cabin. Too bad traction
control is not available.
</P>
<P>
   It may have taken some time, but the Malibu, first introduced in
'64 as a Chevelle model and a rear-drive until '84, is a serious
import-fighter.

   The New York Times News Service calls your attention to a
three-part series moving this weekend on the new identity being
forged by America's immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike immigrants of the past, many of today's new Americans are
choosing to straddle two worlds. They may live in the United
States, but with cut-rate phone cards and frequent-flier miles,
with modems, fax machines and video cameras, they can participate
in life back home with an immediacy unimagined by any previous
generation.
</P>
<P>
   The three articles will move in two forms: full length as
published in The New York Times and in abbreviated versions of
perhaps half or less of the full length. They will move on
Saturday, Sunday and Monday in the ``a'' news file and are for
publication beginning Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The budget for the series follows:
</P>
<P>
   IMMIG-IDENTITY (Undated) _ For a New York couple, many a day can
start in blaring traffic on the Grand Central Parkway Queens and
end on horseback in the verdant countryside of their native
Dominican Republic, cantering down to a river to feast on rum and
goat. They, like many modern immigrants, no longer consign their
homeland to the mist of memory or nostalgia. As the world has grown
smaller, the immigrant experience has become one of remaining
connected, economically, culturally, politically. Such a fluid
exchange between the homeland and the new land, which inevitably
alters both places, has unsettled many Americans, and this unease
underlies the current debates about immigration, multiculturalism
and bilingualism. By Deborah Sontag and Celia W. Dugger. (7,000
words.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (For use Sunday, July 19, and thereafter.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   IMMIG-TRADITION (Jaipur, India) _ In modern immigrant families,
where the bindings between here and there are stronger than ever
before, children almost inevitably find themselves pushed and
pulled between the culture and values of their parents and those of
the larger American society. Such ambiguities are perhaps never
more acute than when a decision about marriage is at hand. But what
emerges at defining moments like Vinit Sethi's traditional Indian
wedding, arranged by his parents, is the way many of these children
search for and find solace and grounding in their connections to
the world back home. By Celia W. Dugger. (5,500 words.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (For use Monday, July 20, and thereafter.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   IMMIG-GLOBALVILLAGE (Chinantla, Mexico) _ Almost every migration
story is the psychodrama of a family, its aspirations and
frustrations, its separations and reunions, its traditions and
compromises. For some Latin American and Caribbean immigrants, as
for the Cruz family of Chinantla, Mexico, it is also the story of a
town, a global village in the most literal sense. By Deborah
Sontag. (6,200 words.)

<P>
   YOSEMITE, Calif. _ Visitors gush at the awesome beauty of
Yosemite National Park, and now, Yosemite gushes back.
</P>
<P>
   An El Nino winter that lasted right through spring now is
crashing head-on into summer in the Sierra Nevada. A snowpack that
was measured at 200 percent of normal in May is quickly melting as
temperatures climb to the 70s and 80s.
</P>
<P>
   In Yosemite, that means roaring waterfalls and raging rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The falls are going berserk,'' says Keith Walklet, a park
spokesman. ``We've got two years' worth of water coming through
here in one season, and it's special. I'm excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Water and granite are the park's most basic elements. From the
beginning of time the slow drip and hard freeze have been the
hammer and chisel that have sculpted Yosemite's breathtaking
grandeur. Ancient glaciers carved the canyons, leaving behind
sharp, steep edges from which water now plunges in world-famous
falls: Bridalveil, Vernal, Nevada, Illilouette and the
awe-inspiring Yosemite Falls, which drops more than 2,400 feet from
canyon rim to valley floor.
</P>
<P>
   Water leaps off every precipice; water leaks off every slope.
The trail to Half Dome is a rushing stream in many spots. The
granite staircase alongside Vernal Fall is practically a waterfall
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Mist Trail, so named for the cooling mists that rise as the
Merced River jumps over Vernal Fall, is more monsoon than mist.
Drenching spray gusts from the gusher as untold tons of whitewater
drop 317 feet over the fall. It soaks with icy efficiency,
buffeting hikers with a winter rainstorm on the warmest of summer
afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being blasted by a fire hose,'' says Walklet. ``But
if you can stand the blast in the face, turn around and look at the
fall in the afternoon. If you're lucky, there's a full, round
rainbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a special season.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the season this year should run ``right on through
autumn,'' unlike most years when most of the park's waterfalls dry
up by September.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the late and heavy snowpack makes this early summer
``special'' in other ways as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Merced River, swollen by snowmelt to flood stage, caused
park officials to make some special arrangements for campers and
travelers last week. A few dozen riverside camp sites were
evacuated as the river rose to threatening levels. And the main
road out of the Yosemite Valley's east end was closed for several
days when the river undercut the road bed, forcing motorists to use
the southern route, Highway 41, to get in and out of the valley.
</P>
<P>
   Hikers will encounter snow at much lower levels. Last week, snow
obscured parts of the trail to Half Dome above the 6,500-foot
level.
</P>
<P>
   But with summer finally coming on strong, the snow is quickly
melting. It leaks out from under the drifts, starting as a trickle,
then gurgling through the forest toward the river through Little
Yosemite Valley. From there it tumbles into churning rapids and
thunders over the falls, its power reverberating through the entire
valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like nothing I've seen in 14 years here,'' Walklet says.
``We're going to be enjoying this all summer long.''
</P>

<P>
   It was one of the memorable moments of television comedy: Martin
Short on ``Saturday Night Live'' as a synchronized swimmer, an
uncoordinated man with a silly fixed grin trying to crash a women's
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was funny,'' Bill May said Wednesday, ``because
I know what synchronized swimming really is. People know what he
did wasn't real and was intended to be taken as a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   May should know that better than anyone else. At 19, he is
Martin Short's character come to life, the only man competing on an
elite level in this water-ballet sport. On Sunday and Monday, in
the first days of competition in the Goodwill Games, May will swim
in the duet and team competition at a new aquatics complex in East
Meadow, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He and his duet partner, Kristina Lum, are also on the
eight-member U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Synchronized swimming traces its roots to ancient Greece, where
only men competed. In modern times, Stephane Miermont won the
French duet title in 1991 and 1992, and 85-year-old Fred Wing of
Lynn, Mass., takes part in masters competitions along with his
wife, Louise, 83.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, women have dominated, none more than Esther Williams,
whose many movies in the 1940s and '50s introduced the public to
synchronized swimming. A few years ago, when she saw May in duet
competition, she was impressed. ``You bring a new romance to this
sport,'' she said, ``and this is what we need.''
</P>
<P>
   International rules governing synchronized swimming bar men from
the Olympics and world championships. But American officials hope
that next year's Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Manitoba, will add
mixed-duet competition. If that happens, they will try to have
mixed duets added to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney as a demonstration
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Synchronized swimmers often hold their breath for a minute while
keeping their heads under water. In 10th-grade biology class, May
said, he once held his breath for three and a half minutes. On
Wednesday, after a team practice at the Asphalt Green AquaCenter at
York Avenue and 91st Street, May talked about being a man in a
woman's world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of support from my family and friends,'' said
May, who is 5 feet 9 inches tall and 150 pounds. ``The only thing
they say is that I'm so lucky to swim with all those women. I think
I've been received very positively. This is good for the sport
because a lot of the time it gets a bad rap. Some people don't
think it's a real sport, but it is. It takes hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   May grew up in Cicero, N.Y., near Syracuse. When he was 10, he
was in a swimming class, and his 7-year-old sister, Courtney, was
in a synchronized swimming class. Their mother would drop them off
together, and he had to sit through his sister's class before he
could swim. One day, he tried synchronized swimming and liked it,
and he switched to that.
</P>
<P>
   As a high school junior, he moved to Santa Clara, Calif., to
train with the Santa Clara Aquamaids, America's leading team. He
shares an apartment there with two teammates, Tuesday Middaugh and
Anna Kozlova.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started this sport because I loved it,'' he said. ``I love
the competition. I love creating new things. I love performing. It
didn't occur to me that not many men were doing it. Now I think I'm
just another member of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, May was paired with Lum as a duet, and they won
the national championship this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's exciting,'' Lum said. ``Hopefully, we're starting
a new era in synchronized swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   His U.S. teammates enjoy having him on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have the strongest people, and he's one of them,''
Becky Jasontek said. ``It's different. It took a little while
getting used to, just knowing I'm swimming with a man. I've been
swimming 17 years and I've never done that before.''
</P>
<P>
   And Carrie Barton said: ``It's great. It adds so much strength
to our sport. We're so used to change, and we want the best on our
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone seems to like May, except for a few athletes who
say he is taking the berth of someone who could swim in the
Olympics. But he has heard only one person booing him. ``It was in
Tonowanda, N.Y.,'' May said. ``I was 15. I just won a competition,
and this one man in the stands booed. Then someone told me I had
just beaten his daughter.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: GETTING ON THE BANDWIDTH BANDWAGON
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, July 19.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I'm listening to a radio station in Strasbourg,
France, that pumps classical music down the Internet with CD-like
fidelity as I type away on my personal computer keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of access isn't yet available to most Internet users.
The current generation of modems are too slow to allow you to join
me, a confirmed early adopter, in drawing your music and movies
from an Internet well.
</P>
<P>
   But if the feds change the rules of the game, as they are likely
to do, in a few years' time we could see a radical speed-up in home
access to cyberspace. That would open up some startling new
programming possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if, for less than $1,000 a year, you could run your own
TV station without seeking a broadcast license from the Federal
Communications Commission. While the network anchors would survive,
the evening stars might shine less brightly as more and more folks
got _ and sent _ their ``news'' via the Net.
</P>
<P>
   The digital revolution runs at warp speed. Consider that when
Bill Clinton arrived in the White House, hardly anyone had even
heard of the Internet. By the time Clinton's moving van drives off,
presumably in January 2001, 60 per cent of U.S. families are
expected to be full netizens.
</P>
<P>
   But the real issue is what kind of access we'll have, and at
what cost. And on that score, the signs look promising.
</P>
<P>
   In early August, the FCC is expected to issue new rules on how
the regional Bell companies can market their long-distance data
networks. Until now, the agency has tightly regulated the pricing
structure for home phone services because the Bells hold a virtual
monopoly on the local dial tone.
</P>
<P>
   But it's likely that the FCC will let the Bells sell high-speed
interactive

girls swoon in the '70s. Osmond hopes to relieve those great times
with sister Marie when ``Donny &AMP; Marie,'' the duo's daytime

   REVIEW-RYAN _ AUSTIN _ In his new World War II film ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' Steven Spielberg _ who grumbles that he's known
chiefly for pumping our emotions with a plastic shark and a plastic
alien _ strove for a battleground realism hitherto unseen at the
movies. And if that meant Spielberg would again, following the
gruelling historical epics ``Schindler's List'' and ``Amistad,''
subvert his hardened reputation as kiddie-friendly confectionery,
then so be it. (Garcia, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   REVIEW-SOLDIERS _ What is it about toy soldiers and action
figures that brings out the amateur warrior within? It's an
intoxicating fantasy world that the makers of the movie ``Small
Soldiers'' hope to tap into. In theaters'the film is a sort of
``Toy Story'' on Parris Island. The plot revolves around a clash
between a faction of steroid-choked, jar-headed G.I. Joe types and
a bunch of more mild-mannered action figures. (Houck, Palm Beach
Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   ZAPRUDER-FILM _ Here is pretty much all you need to know about
the new, digitally enhanced version of the Zapruder film: 53

exploding. That's all anyone wants to see, isn't it? Really, that's
all there is. (Kalajian, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

won't make you look like a slob. (And you can wash 'em at home!)
(Grantham, Palm Beach Post) ETA 8 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   KIDS-LANGUAGES _ AUSTIN _ Twice recently in a two-week period,
parents planning to relocate to the Austin area called the Round
Rock Independent School District to find out if Spanish is part of
the elementary level curriculum there. Not in Round Rock. Yet some
local students _ those whose parents can afford it and have made
the effort to find or initiate programs _ are learning foreign
languages from Spanish to Chinese to Hebrew to Italian. (Bonnin,
Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   EYMAN-ON-BOOKS _ Christopher Moore, author of ``Practical
Demonkeeping'' and ``Island of the Sequined Love Nun,'' has turned
his skewed brain to the topic of Bestsellers I Never Wrote and come
up with several possibilities. Moore's most commercial idea, is
``Men are Homeless, Women Got Mars in the Settlement,'' the true
story of how the only honest communication between the sexes comes
through depositions. (Eyman, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   VETSVILLE _ These are Chris Noel's men. For those of you who
don't have dogtags, Noel was the blond bombshell behind the Armed
Forces Radio show ``A Date with Chris'' that heartened U.S.
soldiers in Vietnam. But beneath the glitz was sorrow. Her first
husband, a Green Beret in Vietnam, shot himself in the head on
Christmas of '69. She blames his death on post-traumatic stress
disorder. On Feb. 22, 1993, she opened the first Vetsville Cease
Fire House, a pair of three-bedroom cottages in Riviera Beach. Five
years later, Vetsville has expanded to four homes, all managed by
the veterans themselves. In the past 10 months alone, 306 honorably
discharged servicemen (Vetsville checks their papers) have sought
refuge at Noel's shelter doors. (Fuchs, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   MARRIAGE-COUNSELING _ Most clergy say couples will not know what
marriage is really like until they have been married for a year or
longer. Many recommend that newlyweds have marital checkups with a
counselor after six months of marriage and again near their first
anniversary. But they insist that serious preparation is critical
for the success of many marriages. Now, the state of Florida has
discovered what clergy have long known. In June, Gov. Lawton Chiles
signed the Marriage Preparation and Preservation Act. The law _
which will take effect next Jan. 1 _ encourages premarital
counseling and requires counseling before parents can be divorced.
(Gushee, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   SHARP-DRIVING _ ATLANTA -- It was like a brief trip into
automotive heaven. As a driving enthusiast, the mere mention of the
German autobahns has been like a vision of sugarplums dancing in my
head. It truly was Christmas in July during a trip to Germany. For
me, it was the ultimate treat. Traveling at speeds in excess of 110
mph, our little 170-horsepower Saab sprinted happily along, once
even legally passing a police car. What a rush! The system seems so
sensible, and it's difficult to argue its logic. Not once in more
than 600 miles of driving did I see a single accident or a tinge of
animosity between drivers. If only we could make it work on our far
superior interstate highway system. (Sharp, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MECHANIC _ ATLANTA -- Gasoline is a hot topic these days. Three
readers have fuel-related questions, two about fuel quality and one
about gas stations. Let's tackle the confusion about fuel first.
David Harris writes: ``I take excellent care of our three cars
(change the oil every 2,500 miles, etc.), but I buy the cheapest
gasoline I can find. How do I determine which fuel is a
good-quality fuel?'' (Carter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TESTDRIVE _ ATLANTA _ Chevrolet likes to bill its Malibu sedan,
a midsize model larger than the Cavalier and smaller than the
Lumina, as ``the car you knew America could build.'' The question
that phrase begs, naturally, is, ``Well, why did it take so long?''
(DeVault, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   PEEPING-CAMERAS (Guilderland, N.Y.) _ Peeping toms have a new
weapon. Home video cameras. No longer confined to window ledges and
tree limbs, voyeurs now stalk their prey at crowded shopping malls,
bus stops and airports with a simple camera stowed in a shopping
bag. Edging up to their victims, they film up skirts and down
blouses, largely without their victims' knowledge. By KIMBERLY
MARTINEAU.

   FERRARO-CAMPAIGN (Albany, N.Y.) _ Geraldine Ferraro's campaign

well-healed competitors. It's uncertain whether Ferraro will have
enough money for TV ads in the two weeks prior to the Sept. 15

   DAN-FOGELBERG (Undated) _ It's been 19 years since a 28-year-old
Dan Fogleberg earned immortality with his No. 2 hit single
``Longer'' which has been used at more weddings than a polka band.
Despite the lack of mega-hits through most of the 80s and 90s,
Fogelberg has maintained a loyal following of fans, some of whom
travel in caravans for up to 10 hours or more to catch his
concerts. By JIM ROGALSKI.

   BBA-YANKEES (Albany, N.Y.) _ Don't worry, New York Yankees fans.
Be happy. Here is a team in the throes of living a dream too vivid
and sublime not to be real. If the government operated as
engagingly and efficiently as the Yankees, there would be no
Internal Revenue Service. By STEVE CAMPBELL.
</P>
<P>
   GLF-BOOK (Malta, N.Y.) _ In college, Andrew Shanley gave up golf
along with all the other establishment things people of his
generation shunned. Golf definitely wasn't cool for him. Worst of
all, his dad did it. Now he believes that the game is a place to
gently connect with his sons. He's written a book, ``Fathers, Sons

   JULY-16 (Danville, Calif.) _ July in America turns out to be a
significant month. July 16 is the anniversary of a historic event
that is never celebrated, seldom acknowledged. By CYNTHIA BASS.
</P>
<P>
   DEATH-PENALTY (Pacifica, Calif.) _ Every execution brings up the
question whether civilized people should officially put other
people to death. In my opinion, the death penalty doesn't belong in
a civilized society. The question, therefore, is whether our
society is civilized. By CARLOS TAHMAZIAN.

   REVIEW-RYAN _ AUSTIN _ In his new World War II film ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' Steven Spielberg _ who grumbles that he's known
chiefly for pumping our emotions with a plastic shark and a plastic
alien _ strove for a battleground realism hitherto unseen at the
movies. And if that meant Spielberg would again, following the
gruelling historical epics ``Schindler's List'' and ``Amistad,''
subvert his hardened reputation as kiddie-friendly confectionery,
then so be it. (Garcia, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

   REVIEW-SOLDIERS _ What is it about toy soldiers and action

``Toy Story'' on Parris Island. The plot revolves around a clash
between a faction of steroid-choked, jar-headed G.I. Joe types and
a bunch of more mild-mannered action figures. (Houck, Palm Beach

don't have dogtags, Noel was the blond bombshell behind the Armed
Forces Radio show ``A Date with Chris'' that heartened U.S.
soldiers in Vietnam. But beneath the glitz was sorrow. Her first
husband, a Green Beret in Vietnam, shot himself in the head on
Christmas of '69. She blames his death on post-traumatic stress
disorder. On Feb. 22, 1993, she opened the first Vetsville Cease
Fire House, a pair of three-bedroom cottages in Riviera Beach. Five
years later, Vetsville has expanded to four homes, all managed by
the veterans themselves. In the past 10 months alone, 306 honorably
discharged servicemen (Vetsville checks their papers) have sought
refuge at Noel's shelter doors. (Fuchs, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   MARRIAGE-COUNSELING _ Most clergy say couples will not know what
marriage is really like until they have been married for a year or
longer. Many recommend that newlyweds have marital checkups with a
counselor after six months of marriage and again near their first
anniversary. But they insist that serious preparation is critical
for the success of many marriages. Now, the state of Florida has
discovered what clergy have long known. In June, Gov. Lawton Chiles
signed the Marriage Preparation and Preservation Act. The law _
which will take effect next Jan. 1 _ encourages premarital
counseling and requires counseling before parents can be divorced.

   SHARP-DRIVING _ ATLANTA -- It was like a brief trip into
automotive heaven. As a driving enthusiast, the mere mention of the
German autobahns has been like a vision of sugarplums dancing in my
head. It truly was Christmas in July during a trip to Germany. For
me, it was the ultimate treat. Traveling at speeds in excess of 110
mph, our little 170-horsepower Saab sprinted happily along, once
even legally passing a police car. What a rush! The system seems so
sensible, and it's difficult to argue its logic. Not once in more
than 600 miles of driving did I see a single accident or a tinge of
animosity between drivers. If only we could make it work on our far
superior interstate highway system. (Sharp, Atlanta

   MECHANIC _ ATLANTA -- Gasoline is a hot topic these days. Three
readers have fuel-related questions, two about fuel quality and one
about gas stations. Let's tackle the confusion about fuel first.
David Harris writes: ``I take excellent care of our three cars
(change the oil every 2,500 miles, etc.), but I buy the cheapest
gasoline I can find. How do I determine which fuel is a
good-quality fuel?'' (Carter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TESTDRIVE _ ATLANTA _ Chevrolet likes to bill its Malibu sedan,
a midsize model larger than the Cavalier and smaller than the
Lumina, as ``the car you knew America could build.'' The question
that phrase begs, naturally, is, ``Well, why did it take so long?''
(DeVault, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

NETSCAPE ANNOUNCES NEW WEB BROWSING SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Netscape wants to be America Online.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message the troubled Mountain View, Calif., company
pushed Thursday along with its new Web browsing software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely a major release,'' proclaims Netscape's Bob
Lisbonne, senior vice president of client products. ``It's a sea
change for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape Communicator 4.5, available free on the Net starting
Thursday (www.home.netscape.com), contains features that will only
work with Netscape's Netcenter portal site.
</P>
<P>
   A portal is a Web site that acts as a jumping off point to the
rest of the World Wide Web. Think of portals as the Internet's
version of TV networks.
</P>
<P>
   Portal sites _ led by Yahoo _ have been the hottest Internet
stocks on Wall Street this summer. Netscape wants to cash in on
that popularity by imitating AOL, the long-standing portal king.
</P>
<P>
   ``But AOL has their content to work with,'' Lisbonne says. ``We
have the entire Internet.'' The new Netscape browser sports a host
of mail, address book and browsing features that automatically link
the user directly to corresponding features on Netcenter.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the browser will automatically call up a link to a
specific Web site _ like www.disney.com _ when a user types in
Mickey Mouse. The feature works off a 1.5 million word dictionary
that creates those Netcenter links.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape has a skin-of-their-teeth Web browser market lead over
Microsoft, at 52.2 percent vs. 45.6 percent (third-party browser
makers hold the remaining 2.2 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Allen Weiner, of Dataquest in San Jose, sees the new
browser as less of a sea change than a ``shell change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's half a revision,'' he says. ``It's really meant as a way
for Netscape to solidify its position. It's meant to slow down
Microsoft a bit.''

<P>
   The gulf separating American and Japanese perceptions of the
U.S. troops stationed in Japan could jeopardize the alliance
between these two important countries.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans see the presence of U.S. troops in Japan as a
gracious favor meant to underpin Japan's security. Most Japanese,
while fond of the alliance with the United States, would like to
see fewer U.S. troops on their soil.
</P>
<P>
   A May 1996 opinion poll in Asahi Shimbun found that 70 percent
of the Japanese people supported the alliance with the United
States while 67 percent favored a reduction in the number of U.S.
military bases. This discriminating public preference is reasonable
in today's Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-Japan Security Treaty was signed during the Korean War
in 1951 at the same time as the San Francisco Peace Treaty, which
formally ended the Allied occupation of Japan. The security treaty
enabled U.S. troops to remain in Japan and opened Japanese
facilities as a staging area and logistics base for American forces
in the war being waged on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military bases in Japan were seen as essential to
containing communist expansion, especially since the Soviet Union,
China and North Korea were considered a monolithic threat.
</P>
<P>
   Today the international environment has changed as dramatically
in East Asia as in Europe. The United States and its allies are no
longer squared off against the Soviet Union. Indeed, the Soviet
Union is no more. Since its collapse, Russian forces in East Asia
have become hollow. A comparison of Japan's 1989 and 1997 white
paper on defense shows a more than 50 percent reduction in the
number of personnel, surface combat ships, submarines and warplanes
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Russia's warships are rusting in port, leaving only a
few submarines and surface ships in the Pacific fleet operational.
According to Japanese military analysts, Russian air force pilots
fly no more than 20 to 30 hours of training time a year, making the
most basic skills difficult to maintain. In Japan, fighter pilots
train a minimum of 150 hours a year.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese specialists estimate that Pyongyang has about 100
modern warplanes, although they get little flying time because of
shortages of fuel and spare parts. Seoul has 400 modern fighter
planes, tanks, attack helicopters and antitank missiles. The
South's edge is clear.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, Pyongyang chooses to act irrationally by launching
a desperate attack, no amount of military power can deter it.
Deterrence assumes reasonable judgment by the enemy. One way to
lessen the likelihood of a senseless strike is to avoid cornering
North Korea's leaders and thus driving them into desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese military power has also diminished considerably. The
number of combat aircraft has fallen to 3,700 from 5,400 ten years
ago. China's submarines have dwindled from 100 to 60, and only
three are modern designs recently imported from Russia. Most of
their 50 or so surface ships are outdated. Given China's current
financial problems, the Chinese army can modernize only gradually.
</P>
<P>
   Washington justifies the privileges it has enjoyed since World
War II by warning the Japanese about what it wrongly claims is an
increase in Chinese military power and the threat posed by Nodon 1,
North Korea's 600-mile-range missile. Simultaneously, it appeals to
its own citizens and other Asian nations by claiming that American
troops forestall any Japanese inclination to remilitarize.
</P>
<P>
   These arguments no longer acknowledge Asia's reality. Like other
advanced countries, from the 19th to the mid-20th century, Japan
committed the blunder of taking overseas territory through
conquest, but it already paid dearly for this in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   It is egotistical for Americans to believe that the United
States has done Japan a favor by defending it all these years by
stationing its forces within the country. U.S. forces in Japan
numbered 260,000 during the 1950s, 47,000 in 1990, and today stand
at 37,000. Whenever more American soldiers leave, the Japanese see
it as more good news.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. army stations only 1,500 personnel on Japan's main
islands, primarily for supply and communications duties. Japan's
land defense is left to its own forces, which include more than
1,000 tanks and 150,000 soldiers. From Tokyo's point of view,
American forces have not really stood in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. ground forces in Japan consist of only 14,000 Marines based
on Okinawa, one of the islands least vulnerable to Soviet attack
during the Cold War. The Japanese are aware that the Marines are
standing by for possible deployment elsewhere in the region, namely
the western Pacific and the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1959 Japan's air defense has been entrusted to its own air
force, which today has a powerful fighter fleet of 200 F-15Js and
100 improved F-4Es as well as 13 early airborne warning aircrafts
and 26 Patriot air-defense batteries. In addition, the ground
self-defense force has a large number of medium- and short-range
surface-to-air missiles. The U.S. Air Force's 54 F-15s, which are
intended mainly for the defense of Korean air space, are safely
tucked away on Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   From the Cold War until today, the U.S. Navy has contributed
indirectly to the prosperity and defense of Japan. The Navy
stations the Seventh Fleet flagship, a communications ship, an
aircraft carrier and its nine escort ships at the Yokosuka port in
Tokyo bay, and six other ships, including four amphibious vessels,
at the Sasebo naval base on western Kyushu.
</P>
<P>
   But these warships were not exclusively for Japan's defense.
They have been deployed in the western Pacific, the Indian Ocean
and the Persian Gulf. Before 1990, however, it was clear that had
the Soviet Union attempted to invade Japan, several U.S. aircraft
carriers would have moved into Japanese waters and interdicted
Soviet sea routes.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear deterrence is a different story. Both Russia and China,
while weak in conventional military power, hold enough nuclear
missiles to destroy Japan. It is legitimate to ask how Japan would
counter nuclear blackmail. Tokyo, which accepted unconditionally
the permanent extension of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in
1995 and renounced development of its own nuclear deterrent, has no
choice but to depend on the nuclear umbrella of an ally.
</P>
<P>
   It is in the interest of the United States, so long as it does
not wish to see Japan withdraw from the NPT and develop its own
nuclear deterrent, to maintain its alliance with Japan and continue
to provide a nuclear umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   From Japan's perspective, friendly relations with the United
States, the only remaining military superpower, are vital. Even if
all common threats disappeared in the next century, the alliance
would still be in Japan's interest.
</P>
<P>
   As the common threat presented by the Cold War diminishes, it is
natural for the Japanese people to be skeptical of the U.S.
military presence. The American military bases cost Japan $4
billion annually. If forgone rent and other revenues are included,
Japan's annual burden jumps to $5 billion, at a time when the
Japanese government faces a serious financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of cost-sharing, Japan bears the largest burden among
U.S. allies for maintaining U.S. forces, with Germany and South
Korea paying $60 million and $290 million, respectively. By a 1995
Special Measures Agreement, Japan is committed through the year
2000 to pay the salaries of 24,000 civilian employees at the bases,
the utility costs, including energy, water and communications, and
most of the construction expenses.
</P>
<P>
   This burden to Japanese taxpayers hangs like a darkening cloud
over the future of the alliance. Japan should honor the 1995
agreement but put America on notice that it will not renew the
agreement in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It is the business of statesmen, not bureaucrats or generals, to
plan for the future. The U.S. military presence in Japan should
fade with this century's end. The time has come for the leaders of
Japan and the United States to discuss an alliance fit for the next
century.

   The gulf separating American and Japanese perceptions of the
U.S. troops stationed in Japan could jeopardize the alliance
between these two important countries.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans see the presence of U.S. troops in Japan as a
gracious favor meant to underpin Japan's security. Most Japanese,
while fond of the alliance with the United States, would like to
see fewer U.S. troops on their soil.
</P>
<P>
   A May 1996 opinion poll in Asahi Shimbun found that 70 percent
of the Japanese people supported the alliance with the United
States while 67 percent favored a reduction in the number of U.S.
military bases. This discriminating public preference is reasonable
in today's Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-Japan Security Treaty was signed during the Korean War
in 1951 at the same time as the San Francisco Peace Treaty, which
formally ended the Allied occupation of Japan. The security treaty
enabled U.S. troops to remain in Japan and opened Japanese
facilities as a staging area and logistics base for American forces
in the war being waged on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military bases in Japan were seen as essential to
containing communist expansion, especially since the Soviet Union,
China and North Korea were considered a monolithic threat.
</P>
<P>
   Today the international environment has changed as dramatically
in East Asia as in Europe. The United States and its allies are no
longer squared off against the Soviet Union. Indeed, the Soviet
Union is no more. Since its collapse, Russian forces in East Asia
have become hollow. A comparison of Japan's 1989 and 1997 white
paper on defense shows a more than 50 percent reduction in the
number of personnel, surface combat ships, submarines and warplanes
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Russia's warships are rusting in port, leaving only a
few submarines and surface ships in the Pacific fleet operational.
According to Japanese military analysts, Russian air force pilots
fly no more than 20 to 30 hours of training time a year, making the
most basic skills difficult to maintain. In Japan, fighter pilots
train a minimum of 150 hours a year.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese specialists estimate that Pyongyang has about 100
modern warplanes, although they get little flying time because of
shortages of fuel and spare parts. Seoul has 400 modern fighter
planes, tanks, attack helicopters and antitank missiles. The
South's edge is clear.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, Pyongyang chooses to act irrationally by launching
a desperate attack, no amount of military power can deter it.
Deterrence assumes reasonable judgment by the enemy. One way to
lessen the likelihood of a senseless strike is to avoid cornering
North Korea's leaders and thus driving them into desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese military power has also diminished considerably. The
number of combat aircraft has fallen to 3,700 from 5,400 ten years
ago. China's submarines have dwindled from 100 to 60, and only
three are modern designs recently imported from Russia. Most of
their 50 or so surface ships are outdated. Given China's current
financial problems, the Chinese army can modernize only gradually.
</P>
<P>
   Washington justifies the privileges it has enjoyed since World
War II by warning the Japanese about what it wrongly claims is an
increase in Chinese military power and the threat posed by Nodon 1,
North Korea's 600-mile-range missile. Simultaneously, it appeals to
its own citizens and other Asian nations by claiming that American
troops forestall any Japanese inclination to remilitarize.
</P>
<P>
   These arguments no longer acknowledge Asia's reality. Like other
advanced countries, from the 19th to the mid-20th century, Japan
committed the blunder of taking overseas territory through
conquest, but it already paid dearly for this in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   It is egotistical for Americans to believe that the United
States has done Japan a favor by defending it all these years by
stationing its forces within the country. U.S. forces in Japan
numbered 260,000 during the 1950s, 47,000 in 1990, and today stand
at 37,000. Whenever more American soldiers leave, the Japanese see
it as more good news.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. army stations only 1,500 personnel on Japan's main
islands, primarily for supply and communications duties. Japan's
land defense is left to its own forces, which include more than
1,000 tanks and 150,000 soldiers. From Tokyo's point of view,
American forces have not really stood in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. ground forces in Japan consist of only 14,000 Marines based
on Okinawa, one of the islands least vulnerable to Soviet attack
during the Cold War. The Japanese are aware that the Marines are
standing by for possible deployment elsewhere in the region, namely
the western Pacific and the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1959 Japan's air defense has been entrusted to its own air
force, which today has a powerful fighter fleet of 200 F-15Js and
100 improved F-4Es as well as 13 early airborne warning aircrafts
and 26 Patriot air-defense batteries. In addition, the ground
self-defense force has a large number of medium- and short-range
surface-to-air missiles. The U.S. Air Force's 54 F-15s, which are
intended mainly for the defense of Korean air space, are safely
tucked away on Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   From the Cold War until today, the U.S. Navy has contributed
indirectly to the prosperity and defense of Japan. The Navy
stations the Seventh Fleet flagship, a communications ship, an
aircraft carrier and its nine escort ships at the Yokosuka port in
Tokyo bay, and six other ships, including four amphibious vessels,
at the Sasebo naval base on western Kyushu.
</P>
<P>
   But these warships were not exclusively for Japan's defense.
They have been deployed in the western Pacific, the Indian Ocean
and the Persian Gulf. Before 1990, however, it was clear that had
the Soviet Union attempted to invade Japan, several U.S. aircraft
carriers would have moved into Japanese waters and interdicted
Soviet sea routes.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear deterrence is a different story. Both Russia and China,
while weak in conventional military power, hold enough nuclear
missiles to destroy Japan. It is legitimate to ask how Japan would
counter nuclear blackmail. Tokyo, which accepted unconditionally
the permanent extension of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in
1995 and renounced development of its own nuclear deterrent, has no
choice but to depend on the nuclear umbrella of an ally.
</P>
<P>
   It is in the interest of the United States, so long as it does
not wish to see Japan withdraw from the NPT and develop its own
nuclear deterrent, to maintain its alliance with Japan and continue
to provide a nuclear umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   From Japan's perspective, friendly relations with the United
States, the only remaining military superpower, are vital. Even if
all common threats disappeared in the next century, the alliance
would still be in Japan's interest.
</P>
<P>
   As the common threat presented by the Cold War diminishes, it is
natural for the Japanese people to be skeptical of the U.S.
military presence. The American military bases cost Japan $4
billion annually. If forgone rent and other revenues are included,
Japan's annual burden jumps to $5 billion, at a time when the
Japanese government faces a serious financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of cost-sharing, Japan bears the largest burden among
U.S. allies for maintaining U.S. forces, with Germany and South
Korea paying $60 million and $290 million, respectively. By a 1995
Special Measures Agreement, Japan is committed through the year
2000 to pay the salaries of 24,000 civilian employees at the bases,
the utility costs, including energy, water and communications, and
most of the construction expenses.
</P>
<P>
   This burden to Japanese taxpayers hangs like a darkening cloud
over the future of the alliance. Japan should honor the 1995
agreement but put America on notice that it will not renew the
agreement in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It is the business of statesmen, not bureaucrats or generals, to
plan for the future. The U.S. military presence in Japan should
fade with this century's end. The time has come for the leaders of
Japan and the United States to discuss an alliance fit for the next
century.

<P>
   Not so long ago, in the mid-1980s, Raisa Gorbachev, in her crisp
pastel business suits, became an internationally known figure as
the Kremlin's first visible first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age sixtysomething, she is still a voice to be heard,
particularly in support of women and children, struggling to
advance, or merely to survive, in the morass of post-communist
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Mellowed and fully recovered from the ordeal of being held
captive under house arrest by hard-line communist rebels, during
the 1991 coup plot against her husband, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the
last president of the former Soviet Union, she remains his constant
world traveling companion, as well as a high-profile commentator on
the Russian scene.
</P>
<P>
   Born in southern Siberia, of a Russian mother and Ukrainian
father, the eldest of three children, she arrived in Moscow at age
17 and graduated from the Philosophical Faculty at Moscow
University in 1954. That's where she met Gorbachev at a dance and,
meanwhile, earned the equivalent of a Ph.D. in the budding science
of sociology.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, her case studies and surveys of the peasants of
Stavropol did much to reveal the normal details of family life
under communism. ``Sociology is basically a science of feedback,''
she says, ``of listening to people, but in a totalitarian society
that constitutes a threat because the opinion of the state was
supposed to be the opinion of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Her doctoral dissertation was about the fact that, despite lip
service to equality, women were less represented in politics than
men, and made less money, and even though many women had higher
education there were very few with Ph.D.s. So that despite the
ideology, in fact, ``the actual situation turned out to be not so
bright.''
</P>
<P>
   Today she believes the declining status of women in Russia is a
reflection of the country's overall social, economic and political
turmoil. Women still bear the brunt of running the household and
feeding the children, and often, because wages are so low, they
also work two or three jobs. Meanwhile, single motherhood is on the
rise; so are rates of divorce, domestic abuse and the numbers of
women who become victims of prostitution rings run by international
crime syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have freedom of speech,'' she reflects, ``that came
with perestroika. But a lot of that is now no more than a facade
because currently people can say whatever they want, but no one
pays any attention. That's not democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In our recent interview over coffee at Boston's Copley Plaza
Hotel _ speaking through the Gorbachev's longtime translator Pavel
Palazchenko _ she recalled the pros and cons of being a
``liberated'' first lady.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CAROLEE MORRISON: As a Russian first lady on the world stage,
you were quite a revolutionary _ was that a strategy of some sort?
</P>
<P>
   RAISA GORBACHEV: The fact is that we really didn't have first
ladies, in the traditional sense of that term. In many civilized
countries _ say, the United States or Germany or France _ there are
laws or traditions or rules that set out the responsibilities and
rights of the wife of the head of state.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, we did not have that. There were czarinas, there were
empresses. Lenin's wife surely had her own personality, but then
came Stalin, and after Stalin, we very simply did not have any role
for the wife of the head of state. No one knew them, they were
invisible and basically nonexistent for the society.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev broke with that tradition, and I was not just a first
lady. My problem was that I was the first first lady in our
country. And the problem was not so much my individual traits or
personal characteristics, but the fact that we had to create a new
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you didn't take it personally, if there was criticism that
you were ``too much out in front''?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. For example, in our country no one was concerned when
Nancy Reagan or Hillary Clinton or wives of Turkish prime ministers
came to Russia on a state visit. Everyone said OK. But so far as I
was concerned, given the patriarchal tradition of our culture, it
caused a very mixed attitude that I was a visible first lady.
</P>
<P>
   But quite a few people too were very proud of me, and are still
proud of me and say, ``We regard you as a person who enhanced the
dignity of the Russian woman.'' But there are those who grumbled
and resented it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I wonder about a comparison of you and Hillary Clinton _ two
intelligent, educated women who had careers, and opinions, and were
criticized for not, in effect, altering your personalities to meet
public expectations after becoming first ladies. Do you feel
anything in common with her?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've been told very often that I resemble Hillary Clinton;
I've been told that in Europe. However I am older, I was before her
and I was the first first lady _ so maybe she resembles me. That's
maybe just a joke, a humorous aside, but so far as Hillary Clinton
goes, I have a lot of respect for her.
</P>
<P>
   I like that she has a lot of energy. I respect women who have
had a professional career. It seems to me that she is very
intelligent. I also like women who are dedicated. And some of the
things she has had to go through recently, I think, indicate that
she has a lot of pride and dignity. She is going through what is
happening with a lot of dignity and professionalism _ this is an
element of character one has to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the circumstances have decided that I was not
able to get together with her. There are, maybe, working against
that, political, maybe some other things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about other American first ladies you've known? I
believe that Barbara Bush wrote in her memoir that you were ``a
pretty package,'' or some such.
</P>
<P>
   A: (laughs) I like Barbara Bush, in a very different way. I had
an easy time with her. I mostly have an easy time with people who
are open, communicative. Barbara Bush is a very natural person, a
very outgoing person. She is as she is. And so what you see is what
you get. ``Heart on her sleeve,'' I heard that phrase. And I
believe she is that kind of an American woman. In a way, I think,
that's a similarity between the American and Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mrs. Yeltsin, I believe, met quite openly with Mrs. Clinton
in November when she toured Russia and the republics and visited
the capital of the Urals, in Yekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think what we see here is that the tradition of the role of
the first lady has now been established. President Yeltsin is
always accompanied by his wife. In the past, wives of Soviet
officials never accompanied them on trips. She is with him, also
working in some charitable activities, opening exhibits, greeting
other first ladies.
</P>
<P>
   No one is concerned, no one pays it any attention. She is there,
it's OK. The wife of former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin also was
traveling with him and our people were no longer upset about it. So
I broke with the old tradition and created a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you feel more support for your work in Russia today?
</P>
<P>
   A: I get many letters from people _ they also approach me
personally to become more active, to work in some kind of movement
for civil empowerment, or for more civic awareness to help enhance
the role and status of women in society.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think Russia will ever have a woman president?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not in the near future. A lot in our country would have to
change. It would be many years before a woman could be president.
Whether it is 10 years or more no one can tell, but I think it will
be more than 10 years. It would take a change toward a civil
society. Russia doesn't have a civil society yet. I would say that
only in countries where democracy is truly established, where a
civil society is truly established, can a woman become president or
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Q: People have commented on the large influence you had, and
have, over your husband. How do you construe this?
</P>
<P>
   A: When people speak about my influence on Mikhail Sergeyevich,
well, there is influence on matters of everyday life, matters that
involve his respect for me, and he is a very respectful person _ so
he respects me as his wife. Of course I would say that we were tied
together by love, but that's a different kind of influence.
</P>
<P>
   I've had my professional career, I read a great deal. Mikhail
Sergeyevich and I always discuss many, many things, and certainly I
develop my own opinions, and sometimes he agrees or he disagrees. I
think we very well express our views to each other.
</P>
<P>
   But I never, ever had any political role, and Gorbachev never
appointed me or any one of his relatives or family members to any
political position _ never, never. Not as adviser or assistant or
aide. Boris Yeltsin has made his daughter a political adviser, and
other family members hold political positions. Gorbachev never did
that.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just that he listened to me either. As head of
state Mikhail Sergeyevich had, and still has, many intelligent
people and associates who brief him on the facts, people who still
work with him. He may listen to me, but the decision is always made
by Gorbachev himself, and then he speaks out and expresses his
stand.
</P>
<P>
   I have never spoken out against a decision he made. It was
always his decision, his leadership, and that decision was law for
us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you define your own work and role today?
</P>
<P>
   A: To me it's a little difficult to define my role. I think it's
for the others to say, and for my husband to say, what they see as
my role.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And your work?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would perhaps talk about Raisa Gorbachev's Club, a civic
group that has been active for almost a year. It was created by me
and a number of wonderful women: authors, journalists, some members
of the State Duma and women who are social scientists. We aren't an
elite club for socializing and not a political club either. We are
a discussion forum to debate the urgent issues.
</P>
<P>
   We are focussing now on an important problem that has not been
properly addressed by government, so we are looking for support
from other people to try to address it: the plight of Russia's
homeless children, 2 million of them, wandering the streets of
Moscow and St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   There are disabled children, children who are victims of crime,
retarded and mentally disturbed children. So many are
disadvantaged, but we are focusing on children with no families,
homeless children, children who've been virtually thrown out on the
street, who live in basements, who sleep in gutters and in sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And your goal is, what, to raise funds?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, and we have selected three main projects: a clinic for
50 children run by Dr. Mikhail Kornyushin, the chief physician at
Moscow's Morozov Children's Hospital; a home for runaway children
called the Road to Home orphanage; and a bus, run by Dr. Vassili
Sereda of the Foundation for a Healthy Generation, which serves
children in four urban areas of St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   The bus goes out three times a week, in rain or cold or hot
weather, and the doctor has what is called a feeding operation. The
bus comes, the kids appear, and if they see there are no policemen
around, dozens of them come. They don't want to be picked up
because many ran away from alcoholic parents; some ran away from
orphanages where they were abused and things were very bad.
</P>
<P>
   So he feeds them; he also treats their wounds, provides
medication, psychological counseling, even clothing. And if someone
is in need of hospitalization, he also does that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it hard for you to make a transition to private life, to
your work, after President Gorbachev stepped down? Or did this
happen very naturally as the time passed?
</P>
<P>
   A: I am someone who always worked. I had a professional career
for 25 years. When Mikhail Sergeyevich stepped down as president,
our life went into a new phase. During the attempted coup, in the
Crimea, they were preparing to either isolate us or to kill us. And
they were not able to do that because Gorbachev had wide-ranging
international recognition, because the world was very alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   After the coup collapsed, nobody expected that we would remain
active. For the first time in the history of Russia, a head of
state could not be confined or executed, or anything like that.
This is another Gorbachev revolution. And he is continuing to work.
He provides for the family. He provides also funding for The
Gorbachev Foundation. He also created the International Green
Cross.
</P>
<P>
   He is speaking out on many things. And I would say that today
the political elite is still persecuting Gorbachev, and creating a
kind of information blackout against Gorbachev, and mistreating
him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you ever consider leaving Russia to lead a more
comfortable life in the West?
</P>
<P>
   A: Any number of suggestions were made to us about moving to the
West, to some other countries, to live pleasantly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you stayed.
</P>
<P>
   A: It is Gorbachev's destiny to remain in Russia; it is his
choice, his position on principle. He always says that he never
doubted the correctness of his decision, his choice of reform. If
he had not opted for reform, he would probably be general secretary
of the Communist Party, and things in Russia would have remained
basically the same as before Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   However, I'm sure that without Gorbachev starting reform in
Russia, nothing would have changed, things would have remained the
same for years. He believes the reforms were good for Russia, so he
says he will stay in Russia until the end, unless of course he is
compelled to leave. And one can imagine some kind of events that
would transpire that he would be expelled from the country.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your marriage is somewhat unusual _ you've been together a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   A: Since each of us was 18 years old ... and today I think we
live one life only. Why should it be different? Why should I oppose
today what his life is? I believe I am helping him now as I was
then and whatever I can do, to the extent that my health permits, I
will still be helping him.

   Not so long ago, in the mid-1980s, Raisa Gorbachev, in her crisp
pastel business suits, became an internationally known figure as
the Kremlin's first visible first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age sixtysomething, she is still a voice to be heard,
particularly in support of women and children, struggling to
advance, or merely to survive, in the morass of post-communist
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Mellowed and fully recovered from the ordeal of being held
captive under house arrest by hard-line communist rebels, during
the 1991 coup plot against her husband, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the
last president of the former Soviet Union, she remains his constant
world traveling companion, as well as a high-profile commentator on
the Russian scene.
</P>
<P>
   Born in southern Siberia, of a Russian mother and Ukrainian
father, the eldest of three children, she arrived in Moscow at age
17 and graduated from the Philosophical Faculty at Moscow
University in 1954. That's where she met Gorbachev at a dance and,
meanwhile, earned the equivalent of a Ph.D. in the budding science
of sociology.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, her case studies and surveys of the peasants of
Stavropol did much to reveal the normal details of family life
under communism. ``Sociology is basically a science of feedback,''
she says, ``of listening to people, but in a totalitarian society
that constitutes a threat because the opinion of the state was
supposed to be the opinion of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Her doctoral dissertation was about the fact that, despite lip
service to equality, women were less represented in politics than
men, and made less money, and even though many women had higher
education there were very few with Ph.D.s. So that despite the
ideology, in fact, ``the actual situation turned out to be not so
bright.''
</P>
<P>
   Today she believes the declining status of women in Russia is a
reflection of the country's overall social, economic and political
turmoil. Women still bear the brunt of running the household and
feeding the children, and often, because wages are so low, they
also work two or three jobs. Meanwhile, single motherhood is on the
rise; so are rates of divorce, domestic abuse and the numbers of
women who become victims of prostitution rings run by international
crime syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have freedom of speech,'' she reflects, ``that came
with perestroika. But a lot of that is now no more than a facade
because currently people can say whatever they want, but no one
pays any attention. That's not democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In our recent interview over coffee at Boston's Copley Plaza
Hotel _ speaking through the Gorbachev's longtime translator Pavel
Palazchenko _ she recalled the pros and cons of being a
``liberated'' first lady.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CAROLEE MORRISON: As a Russian first lady on the world stage,
you were quite a revolutionary _ was that a strategy of some sort?
</P>
<P>
   RAISA GORBACHEV: The fact is that we really didn't have first
ladies, in the traditional sense of that term. In many civilized
countries _ say, the United States or Germany or France _ there are
laws or traditions or rules that set out the responsibilities and
rights of the wife of the head of state.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, we did not have that. There were czarinas, there were
empresses. Lenin's wife surely had her own personality, but then
came Stalin, and after Stalin, we very simply did not have any role
for the wife of the head of state. No one knew them, they were
invisible and basically nonexistent for the society.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev broke with that tradition, and I was not just a first
lady. My problem was that I was the first first lady in our
country. And the problem was not so much my individual traits or
personal characteristics, but the fact that we had to create a new
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you didn't take it personally, if there was criticism that
you were ``too much out in front''?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. For example, in our country no one was concerned when
Nancy Reagan or Hillary Clinton or wives of Turkish prime ministers
came to Russia on a state visit. Everyone said OK. But so far as I
was concerned, given the patriarchal tradition of our culture, it
caused a very mixed attitude that I was a visible first lady.
</P>
<P>
   But quite a few people too were very proud of me, and are still
proud of me and say, ``We regard you as a person who enhanced the
dignity of the Russian woman.'' But there are those who grumbled
and resented it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I wonder about a comparison of you and Hillary Clinton _ two
intelligent, educated women who had careers, and opinions, and were
criticized for not, in effect, altering your personalities to meet
public expectations after becoming first ladies. Do you feel
anything in common with her?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've been told very often that I resemble Hillary Clinton;
I've been told that in Europe. However I am older, I was before her
and I was the first first lady _ so maybe she resembles me. That's
maybe just a joke, a humorous aside, but so far as Hillary Clinton
goes, I have a lot of respect for her.
</P>
<P>
   I like that she has a lot of energy. I respect women who have
had a professional career. It seems to me that she is very
intelligent. I also like women who are dedicated. And some of the
things she has had to go through recently, I think, indicate that
she has a lot of pride and dignity. She is going through what is
happening with a lot of dignity and professionalism _ this is an
element of character one has to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the circumstances have decided that I was not
able to get together with her. There are, maybe, working against
that, political, maybe some other things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about other American first ladies you've known? I
believe that Barbara Bush wrote in her memoir that you were ``a
pretty package,'' or some such.
</P>
<P>
   A: (laughs) I like Barbara Bush, in a very different way. I had
an easy time with her. I mostly have an easy time with people who
are open, communicative. Barbara Bush is a very natural person, a
very outgoing person. She is as she is. And so what you see is what
you get. ``Heart on her sleeve,'' I heard that phrase. And I
believe she is that kind of an American woman. In a way, I think,
that's a similarity between the American and Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mrs. Yeltsin, I believe, met quite openly with Mrs. Clinton
in November when she toured Russia and the republics and visited
the capital of the Urals, in Yekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think what we see here is that the tradition of the role of
the first lady has now been established. President Yeltsin is
always accompanied by his wife. In the past, wives of Soviet
officials never accompanied them on trips. She is with him, also
working in some charitable activities, opening exhibits, greeting
other first ladies.
</P>
<P>
   No one is concerned, no one pays it any attention. She is there,
it's OK. The wife of former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin also was
traveling with him and our people were no longer upset about it. So
I broke with the old tradition and created a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you feel more support for your work in Russia today?
</P>
<P>
   A: I get many letters from people _ they also approach me
personally to become more active, to work in some kind of movement
for civil empowerment, or for more civic awareness to help enhance
the role and status of women in society.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think Russia will ever have a woman president?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not in the near future. A lot in our country would have to
change. It would be many years before a woman could be president.
Whether it is 10 years or more no one can tell, but I think it will
be more than 10 years. It would take a change toward a civil
society. Russia doesn't have a civil society yet. I would say that
only in countries where democracy is truly established, where a
civil society is truly established, can a woman become president or
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Q: People have commented on the large influence you had, and
have, over your husband. How do you construe this?
</P>
<P>
   A: When people speak about my influence on Mikhail Sergeyevich,
well, there is influence on matters of everyday life, matters that
involve his respect for me, and he is a very respectful person _ so
he respects me as his wife. Of course I would say that we were tied
together by love, but that's a different kind of influence.
</P>
<P>
   I've had my professional career, I read a great deal. Mikhail
Sergeyevich and I always discuss many, many things, and certainly I
develop my own opinions, and sometimes he agrees or he disagrees. I
think we very well express our views to each other.
</P>
<P>
   But I never, ever had any political role, and Gorbachev never
appointed me or any one of his relatives or family members to any
political position _ never, never. Not as adviser or assistant or
aide. Boris Yeltsin has made his daughter a political adviser, and
other family members hold political positions. Gorbachev never did
that.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just that he listened to me either. As head of
state Mikhail Sergeyevich had, and still has, many intelligent
people and associates who brief him on the facts, people who still
work with him. He may listen to me, but the decision is always made
by Gorbachev himself, and then he speaks out and expresses his
stand.
</P>
<P>
   I have never spoken out against a decision he made. It was
always his decision, his leadership, and that decision was law for
us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you define your own work and role today?
</P>
<P>
   A: To me it's a little difficult to define my role. I think it's
for the others to say, and for my husband to say, what they see as
my role.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And your work?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would perhaps talk about Raisa Gorbachev's Club, a civic
group that has been active for almost a year. It was created by me
and a number of wonderful women: authors, journalists, some members
of the State Duma and women who are social scientists. We aren't an
elite club for socializing and not a political club either. We are
a discussion forum to debate the urgent issues.
</P>
<P>
   We are focussing now on an important problem that has not been
properly addressed by government, so we are looking for support
from other people to try to address it: the plight of Russia's
homeless children, 2 million of them, wandering the streets of
Moscow and St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   There are disabled children, children who are victims of crime,
retarded and mentally disturbed children. So many are
disadvantaged, but we are focusing on children with no families,
homeless children, children who've been virtually thrown out on the
street, who live in basements, who sleep in gutters and in sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And your goal is, what, to raise funds?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, and we have selected three main projects: a clinic for
50 children run by Dr. Mikhail Kornyushin, the chief physician at
Moscow's Morozov Children's Hospital; a home for runaway children
called the Road to Home orphanage; and a bus, run by Dr. Vassili
Sereda of the Foundation for a Healthy Generation, which serves
children in four urban areas of St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   The bus goes out three times a week, in rain or cold or hot
weather, and the doctor has what is called a feeding operation. The
bus comes, the kids appear, and if they see there are no policemen
around, dozens of them come. They don't want to be picked up
because many ran away from alcoholic parents; some ran away from
orphanages where they were abused and things were very bad.
</P>
<P>
   So he feeds them; he also treats their wounds, provides
medication, psychological counseling, even clothing. And if someone
is in need of hospitalization, he also does that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it hard for you to make a transition to private life, to
your work, after President Gorbachev stepped down? Or did this
happen very naturally as the time passed?
</P>
<P>
   A: I am someone who always worked. I had a professional career
for 25 years. When Mikhail Sergeyevich stepped down as president,
our life went into a new phase. During the attempted coup, in the
Crimea, they were preparing to either isolate us or to kill us. And
they were not able to do that because Gorbachev had wide-ranging
international recognition, because the world was very alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   After the coup collapsed, nobody expected that we would remain
active. For the first time in the history of Russia, a head of
state could not be confined or executed, or anything like that.
This is another Gorbachev revolution. And he is continuing to work.
He provides for the family. He provides also funding for The
Gorbachev Foundation. He also created the International Green
Cross.
</P>
<P>
   He is speaking out on many things. And I would say that today
the political elite is still persecuting Gorbachev, and creating a
kind of information blackout against Gorbachev, and mistreating
him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you ever consider leaving Russia to lead a more
comfortable life in the West?
</P>
<P>
   A: Any number of suggestions were made to us about moving to the
West, to some other countries, to live pleasantly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you stayed.
</P>
<P>
   A: It is Gorbachev's destiny to remain in Russia; it is his
choice, his position on principle. He always says that he never
doubted the correctness of his decision, his choice of reform. If
he had not opted for reform, he would probably be general secretary
of the Communist Party, and things in Russia would have remained
basically the same as before Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   However, I'm sure that without Gorbachev starting reform in
Russia, nothing would have changed, things would have remained the
same for years. He believes the reforms were good for Russia, so he
says he will stay in Russia until the end, unless of course he is
compelled to leave. And one can imagine some kind of events that
would transpire that he would be expelled from the country.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your marriage is somewhat unusual _ you've been together a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   A: Since each of us was 18 years old ... and today I think we
live one life only. Why should it be different? Why should I oppose
today what his life is? I believe I am helping him now as I was
then and whatever I can do, to the extent that my health permits, I
will still be helping him.

NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME 
</HEADLINE>

 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I recently dismissed Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 98 operating
system as barely worthy of notice. Then I saw the sales figures.
</P>
<P>
   Now I know the economy's in great shape. Why else would so many
consumers pay $90 for software that's not worth half that? Compared
to Windows 95, which was a dramatic improvement from earlier
versions of Windows, Windows 98 is just a lot of tweaks and bug
fixes. Yet according to the research firm PC Data, Windows 98 is
selling as fast as Windows 95 did _ 500,000 copies in its first
four days. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   But another aspect of the upgrade saga came as no surprise.
Customers gripe that Windows 98 is buggy and difficult to install
on many computers. Already, Microsoft says it will release a
``service pack'' in September with fixes for Windows 98 bugs. It's
a new chapter in an old story _ Microsoft's notorious habit of
selling software before it ripens.
</P>
<P>
   There are also many reports of conflicts between Windows 98 and
older computer hardware. For example, some of the new Windows
features, such as better battery power management on laptops, will
only work if your computer has an updated set of instructions
called a BIOS. These BIOS instructions are permanently stored on a
chip inside the machine, which can be updated as necessary. In
addition, when you run Windows 98, some add-on hardware devices
like sound cards need updated drivers _ the little programs that
let the devices talk to the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   A number of major computer companies, including Compaq Computer
Corp. and Dell Computer Corp., have posted discussions of these
problems on their Web sites. In some cases, the companies urge
consumers not to install Windows 98 until they've also obtained the
necessary BIOS or driver updates. So check with your machine's
maker before you do something rash.
</P>
<P>
   None of this was a problem for me when I installed a reviewer's
copy of Windows 98 on my home machine a couple of months ago. For
one thing, it's got a new BIOS on the motherboard. Besides, I
wasn't brave enough to install the new software on top of Windows
95. I did that once with a beta version of Microsoft's Internet
Explorer 4.0 browser, and it took me two weeks to get the machine
working properly again. So I took the coward's way out, and did a
``clean install'' of Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   I used an excellent utility called System Commander Deluxe that
lets you chop a drive into multiple segments, or partitions, and
treat each one as if it were a separate drive. System Commander
lets you put a different operating system on each partition, and
boot up whichever you like _ DOS, Windows, OS/2, Linux, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   So it was easy to stick Windows 98 on a newly-created partition
where it wouldn't do any harm. Of course, I had to reinstall my
Windows software onto the new partition, but with CD-ROMs, that
doesn't take too long. And if anything had gone wrong, my old
Windows 95 setup and all my data files were safe.
</P>
<P>
   If you've got some extra room on the hard drive, you might want
to use this method. System Commander Deluxe runs about $70, but
there's a $30 ``lite'' version especially for Windows 98 installs.
</P>
<P>
   But after hearing many upgrade complaints, I decided to install
Windows 98 on my Windows 95 partition. I don't believe in suicide
missions, so I took precautions to make the process as smooth as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   I made copies of my important data files, just in case. Next, I
cleaned out a folder called C:/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/StartUp.
This is a folder for programs that start automatically whenever you
boot up. Reboots happen a lot during Windows 98 installation, and
purging this folder can prevent conflicts and speed up the process.
Just copy the contents of the folder to another location, and put
them back once you've finished the installation.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I ran Norton Disk Doctor to repair any damaged files on
my hard drive, as well as Speed Disk, which sorts the files on your
disk for maximum efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't have the Norton Utilities, Windows 95 has two
similar products &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; Scandisk and Disk Defragmenter.
</P>
<P>
   And it all worked. Windows 98 installed smoothly and hasn't
given me a hint of trouble so far. My only problem is figuring out
why so many people are actually buying this thing.

A MODERN MIXER FOR THE HIGHLY WIRED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL SAUNDERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Nobel Prizes were awarded for lack of social skills,
telephone circuits would sizzle from all the long-distance
congratulations passed between Stockholm and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Hand in glove with Boston's role as one of the country's
technology centers is its reputation as safe harbor for all sorts
of brilliant characters who can expound for hours on fluid dynamics
but get that deer-in-the-headlights look when asked something
complex, such as whether he or she is currently dating someone.
More than just fodder for endless ``Dilbert'' comics, this social
isolation is something that Bob Ayers is trying to eliminate _ at
least for a few hours at a time. Ayers created a successful lecture
series, The Next 20 Years, that has evolved into a modern mixer for
the country's most highly wired.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the middle of the idea is that everyone in the new media
industry is working ridiculous hours and they don't get to meet
each other often except over e-mail,'' Ayers said, reached by
telephone in his San Francisco office. ``Things happen when you
throw people in a darkened room with cocktails and live jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hold these events in clubs because we want to shake up the
inherent stodginess. It's better to bring a lot of the most
established people into a place that's more edgy, than the
opposite,'' Ayers said. ``We want to put people up there on stage
who have interesting thoughts and want to share them, we want to
show people new technology. But we also want them to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Next 20 Years is an amplified spinoff of a San Francisco new
media-industry salon called Last Saturdays that Ayers started in
1993. The ideal panel, Ayres explains, is a mix of visionaries and
business minds, dreamers butting heads with pragmatists, all of
whom can breathe life into dry theory.

   What we've been playing with: Live Act from Magix Entertainment,
an engaging product that wraps a comprehensive music editing tool
in a slick interface designed to appeal to teenagers and young
adults. Think of Live Act ($50) as a musical Lego kit that enables
users to build songs out of discrete blocks of sound. That's true
with all editing tools, but Live Act (unlike its stablemates in the
Magix product line) goes beyond basic sample sequencing and
playback by allowing users to play music in real time.
</P>
<P>
   Most forms of electronica are represented in the sample pool _
ambient, acid jazz, drum and bass, hardcore techno, etc. _ so the
music created is usually very propulsive and beat heavy. By
altering pitch and tempo, and editing out certain notes, even the
most twinkly Hi-NRG track can be given a speaker-thudding dub
treatment. One quibble here: the sample quality is excellent but
purposely kept a little thin, possibly because add-on sample discs
are available for $20 each.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible to jump right in and start playing, but reading
the clearly written manual will enhance the process and steepen the
learning curve. Experienced users of other editing packages (the
excellent Cakewalk is among the leaders) will immediately notice
that there's no graphical representation of the arranged samples.
This was only a minor annoyance that faded after about an hour of
tinkering, and besides, Live Act is definitely not meant for
professional use.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Live Act are sound editing tools used in its
predecessors, Music Maker 3.0 and Music Studio 3.0. Music Maker is
a basic sample arranger, while Music Studio includes sequencing
software that greatly expands the sonic palette. Live Act combines
these, adds real-time composing functions, and includes .avi video
clips that were packaged in deluxe versions of Music Maker and
Music Studio.
</P>
<P>
   We couldn't get excited about the rudimentary video editing
features in any of these products. They were only marginally
interesting, and tended to be RAM hogs on a P-166 with 16 megs RAM.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   In a year of excellent real-time strategy games, MechCommander
has muscled its way to the top. This new game from Fasa Interactive
and Microprose elevates and enhances the RTS component of the
venerable MechWarrior series by incorporating first-rate graphics
with some of the best artificial intelligence we've seen in a
while.
</P>
<P>
   In several missions, enemy mechs lure you away from the
objective you're supposed to be defending, while a flanking force
creeps in from the opposide side. Similar tactics were used in all
the MechWarrior games; none, however, had this level of emphasis on
resource management and strategic combat.
</P>
<P>
   The screen interface is both clear and detailed, with realistic
video clips of other combatants that boost the adrenaline rush. So
far, it has evicted Total Annhilation from the disc drive and we're
waiting to see if it can hold the fort against Dominion: Storm Over
Gift 3, the highly anticipated RTS game from Ion Storm.

   CONCORD, Mass. _ Ever gone to the paint store and stared
glassy-eyed at those little paint chips? With such subtle
differences from one chip to the next, how do you pick the hue that
best adheres to your color scheme? Maybe you don't even have a
scheme? Not knowing where to begin, you make a selection out of
pure frustration. The results: ghastly, and expensive.

   To the rescue comes ``The Perfect Palette: Fifty Inspired Color
Plans for Painting Every Room in Your Home,'' by local writer
Bonnie Rosser Krims. Just published by Warner Books, it was the
editor's selection last month for Country Homes &AMP; Gardens Book
Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 50 recipes in my book, and each recipe is part of a
chapter representing the seven colors of the spectrum,'' says
Krims, 43, a painter, flutist, color consultant, wife, and mother
of Elise, 4, and Maxwell, 1. ``So there are seven or eight recipes
in each section, starting with red, orange, yellow, and green and
ending with blue, indigo, and violet. What makes it easy is that
every recipe has the same elements _ a title and theme, three main
colors, an accent color, and a trim color.''
</P>
<P>
   To wit: The red section contains a recipe called Pompeii. The
three main colors are red, blue-green, and yellow. These are the
colors to be used on the walls, furniture, and accessories. Black
and white, the accent colors, are to be used on pillows, flowers,
and lamps. White and yellow, the final color, is for trim.
</P>
<P>
   While the book's precept may sound ambitious, its format,
instructions, illustrations, and photographs will be a valuable aid
to even the most inept decorator.
</P>
<P>
   Under the three main colors, which stretch across the top of
each right-hand page, are the paint reference numbers from Benjamin
Moore. At the back of the book is a cross-reference chart listing
the Moore colors and corresponding color numbers from two other
manufacturers _ Pratt &AMP; Lambert and Pittsburgh Paints.
</P>
<P>
   With Krims explaining everything in her introduction, your cat
could follow her instructions. She personalizes every recipe,
bringing a homey spirit to what could otherwise have been a dry
book. Her thoughts on each color scheme are in line with her belief
that colors influence our emotions and attitudes. Under the recipe
for Pompeii, for example, she lists the adjectives that she feels
most represent these colors _ ``rich, lush, muted.'' In the
accompanying block of type, she draws on memories of studying in
Italy and Greece and falling in love with ancient frescoes.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``The people in Pompeii lived in rooms with elaborately
decorated walls, ceilings, floors, and furnishings. The frescoes
were primarily decorative rather than symbolic'' and ``were
initially painted in restrained black, white, and reds and
eventually changed to greens, blues, yellows, and sometimes
purples.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Krims then suggests where this color scheme is most appropriate
in the home and what furniture and accessories to use _ `a red
living room, dining room, or library ``with the most formal of
furnishings in sleek, refined, and delicate designs. Heavy
upholstery fabrics and elaborate window treatments are suitable.''
</P>
<P>
   For a recipe she calls Provence in the section on yellow, Krims
advises using rustic distressed or painted furniture with printed
florals, plaids in red and white, and checkered fabrics _
essentially ``piling texture on texture, pattern on pattern.'' For
a simpler approach, she suggests solid-colored fabrics and such
accessories as painted trays, biscuit tins, and wire baskets.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, each recipe includes not only the color scheme
but decorating ideas as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this book is a fail-proof formula that gives answers
but also allows a certain amount of creativity and choice,'' says
Krims, who began the book after moving to Concord with her husband
six years ago. To plan the look of her new home, she jotted down
the color scheme for the first floor of her house. ``In my own home
I wanted to achieve the most continuity possible throughout the
house.''
</P>
<P>
   She chose three main colors, yellow, green, and red _
represented in the recipe called Glastonbury. The accent color is
blue and the trim off-white. She chose yellow for the family room,
red for the hallway, and pale green for the living/dining room. She
painted the kitchen off-white and used the accent color, a deep
indigo, for the porch off the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   She says another plus in this flow of complementary colors is
that furniture and accessories can be moved from room to room
because they come from the same palette.
</P>
<P>
   What Krims emphasizes most is that people ``tune in to colors.''
When she consults with clients, she asks them what colors come to
mind when they are thinking of a favorite season, vacation, smell,
or clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, I love the colors of Greece in the summer _ blue,
white, and lilac _ and the smell of lilac,'' says Krims, whose
Lilac recipe suggests violet, beige, and brown as the main colors
with green and coral accents and light or dark natural wood or
brown paint. With it, to add just one more element to her recipes,
Krims includes favorite quotations; in this case she takes a quote
from Humbert Wolfe's appropriately named ``The Lilac.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Who thought of the lilac? ``I,'' dew said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made up the lilac, out of my head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She made up the lilac? Pooh?'' thrilled a linnet,
</P>
<P>
   And each dewy note had a lilac on it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, while running a small business painting and
selling used furniture, Krims fell into color consulting.
</P>
<P>
   As she delivered the finished products to her customers, they
would often ask her help on a color scheme to go with the piece of
furniture. Krims obliged _ for free. Eventually, she realized she
could charge for her expertise.
</P>
<P>
   When she stopped painting furniture during her first pregnancy
because of the fumes from stripping compounds, Krims augmented her
consulting money by doing small oil paintings. At the time, a
gallery in Acton sold her work for between $900 and $1,200. She no
longer has the time for these small jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Krims says she is planning to write a second book, one that will
have the same format but concentrate solely on interior decorating.
She notes that she gives 5 percent of her book profits and
consulting fees to Habitat for Humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that I have arrived, and that it is time to give back.
I never thought I would own a home, be married, and have
children.''

FERRARO TRAILS HER OPPONENTS IN CAMPAIGN FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Geraldine Ferraro's campaign garnered $702,000 in
funds in the past quarter, well short of filling the vast gap
between her and the well-healed competitors seeking the same U.S.
Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectations for her are very high,'' said Henry
Sheinkopf, a political strategist. ``Certainly people will be
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheinkopf said it's uncertain whether Ferraro, with just $1.1
million on hand after spending roughly half of the $2 million she
has raised, will have enough money for crucial television ads in
the two weeks prior to the Sept. 15 primary.
</P>
<P>
   In the hotly contested race, incumbent Republican Alfonse
D'Amato, as expected, flexed his fund-raising muscle and eclipsed
$20 million in total collections while spending some $8 million,
according to campaign documents which became available on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, of the Democratic candidates, it appears only Rep.
Charles Schumer, who has raised $12 million, has the financial
strength to box with D'Amato, although polls continue to show that
Ferraro leads Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, who has raised almost $12 million, listed $7.2 million
on hand after spending about $2 million during the reporting period
(April 1 to June 30), compared with $1.6 million in the first three
months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Public Advocate Mark Green has raised $2.55
million to date, records show, including $567,678 during the latest
quarter. Green reported $1,054,429 cash on hand after spending
$351,122 during the period.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato is on track to spend more than four times the average of
$4.7 million on a victorious Senate campaign for a seat usually won
by the person with the most money.
</P>
<P>
   Although political strategists rate Ferraro's fund-raising
efforts as disappointing, the former congressswoman from New York
City put a different spin on the money-gathering program.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponents and I have together this quarter raised nearly
the same amount as Al D'Amato has alone, which means that Democrats
are just as competitive as Republicans this election cycle,''
Ferraro said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Center For Responsive Politics, a non-partisan,
non-profit research group in Washington, D.C., candidates don't
have to outspend their opponents to win. But it helps.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the top-spending candidates won 92 percent of House of
Representatives races and 88 percent of of Senate contests, the
group said.
</P>
<P>
   Well-funded incumbents easily beat under-funded challengers, the
center said.
</P>
<P>
   Even in open seat races, the top spenders were the most likely
to win. A total of 43 of the 53 races lacking incumbent congressmen
were won by the top-spending candidate, as were 12 of 14 open
Senate contests.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 elections, the average House winner spent $673,000.
Senate winners' campaigns averaged $4.7 million.

PACK OF TWO 
The Intricate Bond Between People and Dogs 
By Caroline Knapp 
Dial, 249 pp., $21.95 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We dog lovers take particular delight not only in telling our
own stories, but in listening to those of others. To hear someone
rhapsodize about the beauty of a pet, or explain in minute detail
the particular quirks and needs of his or her little companion, is
enchanting. That's why dog books have such potential as big
sellers.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pack of Two: The Intricate Bond Between People and Dogs,''
Caroline Knapp writes the story of her relationship with her own
dog, and weaves in the experiences of others _ mostly other single,
urban women.
</P>
<P>
   She shows us the beauty, intelligence, and personality of her
dear Lucille, a mixed-breed rescued from a shelter, who may look
unremarkable to others but means everything to the woman who knows
her.
</P>
<P>
   Knapp becomes a poet when she describes this serious little dog:
``When you study a dog you love, you find beauty in every small
detail, and so it is with Lucille: I have become enchanted by the
small asymmetrical whorls of white fur on either side of her chest,
and by her tail, which she carries in a high, confident curve, and
by her eyes, which are watchful and intelligent, the color of
chestnuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Knapp is a talented writer, an astute observer, and a dog lover
of the highest rank. So she is at her best describing Lucille and
the happiness of being in her company. There is a thrill to the
cozy little scene in which Knapp has settled in for the night,
wrapped in a bathrobe, curled up with a crossword puzzle: ``I pass
a lot of evenings this way, hunkered down in that chair, and
sometimes I'll look up from whatever I'm doing, and I'll watch
Lucille for a moment or two. She always knows when I've turned my
attention to her _ she'll open her eyes and gaze back _ and I often
revel in the sense of comfort this gives me, the two of us together
in our quiet affinity.''
</P>
<P>
   Every owner can identify with that feeling, or with the tale of
the blue ball, Lucille's most treasured toy, which Knapp has gone
to heroic measures to rescue. The author will climb fences and ford
streams to retrieve that ball for her dog (non-dog people probably
think this should be the other way around).
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone will identify with Knapp's approach when she
leaves the anecdotal behind. In fact, the problem with ``Pack of
Two'' is that too much of it is told from the perspective of the
analyst's couch instead of the dog bed.
</P>
<P>
   There is a high level of intellectual, urban angst about the
meaning of life. Lucille is often some kind of canine Rorschach
test for Knapp's self-analysis. Most of us have experienced the
frustration of calling a dog who won't come; for Knapp, it's an
event fraught with emotional ramifications. ``When she ignores me
like this, I feel some well of fear rise up about being inadequate,
unworthy of attention, out of control. I hear a small voice inside:
... She doesn't come because she doesn't love you.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this perspective that will be jarring to many dog owners
who count on the love of their dogs. Rather than a source of
anxiety, most people report, dogs are a refuge from stress; they
bring us comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Lucille does this for Knapp at times, yet so much of
the book concentrates on fear and anxiety. Am I doing the right
thing? Does she love me? Do other people think I'm crazy for loving
a dog this much?
</P>
<P>
   Not feeding Lucille from the dinner table inspires pages of
anguish: ``In my mind, food is loaded with meaning, and the giving
and withholding of food are profoundly emotional acts.'' Tail
wagging, dreaming, sitting, running _ all these doggie behaviors
prompt soul-searching for Knapp, who didn't go out to dinner for
six months after finding Lucille because she couldn't bear the
separation.
</P>
<P>
   Knapp, the author of ``Drinking: A Love Story,'' says if there
were a 12-step program for codependent dog owners, she would be in
it. And she seems to associate with others who would be, too _
Milton, the psychiatrist who can't stand to see his boxer play
because it makes him remember feeling vulnerable as an unathletic
child in gym class; and Jonathan, who couldn't ever let his dog out
of his sight, not even for business meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dog as symbol, dog as mirror, dog as barometer of human
affairs,'' one section begins. But Knapp is at her best _ and I
wish there were a lot more of it _ when writing about dog as dog.
In those moments, even in the silly interactions, Knapp touches
upon this little miracle of loving a dog, and the utter joy it
brings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armed with the blue ball,'' Knapp writes, ``Lucille gets to
run, and I get to act like a kid. I shout _ `Good save! Yes!' _ and
I run after her, and I tear off my jacket and scale fences, and I
laugh out loud.''
</P>
<P>
   When Knapp simply loses herself in Lucille there is magic. Too
bad the reader has to negotiate such vast, sometimes overwhelmingly
dense psychological terrain to get to those warm and verdant spots.

DECENCY AND THE SWISS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERN, Switzerland -- Madeleine Kunin, the US ambassador to
Switzerland, relates the story: An elderly woman, a Holocaust
survivor, is being treated in a Swiss hospital. She is attended by
a nurse, a younger woman, who spots the bluish-green number
tattooed on her arm at Auschwitz. ``Oh, how clever of you!'' the
nurse exclaims. ``You put your telephone number on your arm so you
won't forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   For a nation that spent World War II completely encircled by
Germany and its allies, Switzerland managed to preserve a
surprising ignorance about the Hitler era. Ignorance in some cases
about the Nazis' crimes; but ignorance as well, far wider and
deeper, about Switzerland's own financial semi-collaboration with
the Third Reich. Only in the last two years have most Swiss finally
begun to acknowledge their country's behavior during (and just
after) the war years. On the whole, of course, Switzerland's people
were resolutely anti-Nazi. But much in the Swiss record was not so
admirable:
</P>
<P>
   The laundering of looted Nazi gold. The export of war materials
to the Reich. The deportation of tens of thousands of Jewish
refugees into the hands of the SS. The forced-labor camps built to
exploit the 25,000 refugees who were admitted. The demand that
passports of German Jews be stamped with a ``J'' (for Jude). The
windows slammed in the face of claimants who tried to recover Swiss
bank deposits left by their murdered kin. The refusal to honor life
insurance policies when surviving relatives could not supply formal
death certificates.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly stuff. And it isn't going away. Fifty years after the
Nazis' defeat, the Swiss are under severe pressure _ from the US
State Department, from Jewish groups, from New York and California
banking regulators _ to make restitution for their wartime
profiteering. Commissions of historians and accountants continue to
dig into the archives of Swiss banks and government agencies.
Switzerland's image is going to get worse before it gets better.
Especially because so many Swiss, far from demonstrating contrition
and goodwill, bristle with resentment and bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   During eight days of meetings and conversation in Switzerland, I
repeatedly encounter an ``ashamed-but'' line. It is true, Swiss
officials and opinion leaders say, that we did things during the
war we must be ashamed of _ but. Then come the excuses and
justifications.
</P>
<P>
   But we had to play ball with the Nazis or we would have been
invaded.
</P>
<P>
   But we had to import German raw materials or our industry would
have collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   But we had to maintain the convertibility of the Swiss franc.
</P>
<P>
   But we had to be sticklers for our banking-secrecy rules.
</P>
<P>
   But we had no way of knowing that some of the gold was coming
from the death camps.
</P>
<P>
   But we weren't the only neutral country, so why don't you pick
on Portugal or Sweden?
</P>
<P>
   This defensiveness echoes everywhere _ I hear it from the Swiss
president, from Swiss diplomats, from Swiss businessmen. And at
times the defensiveness descends to the verge of something uglier.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is an impossibility,'' snaps one prominent banker, ``is
that we make a deal under the pressure of some Jewish lawyers.''
There is a whiff of anti-Semitism in the air. When I ask the young
Swiss professionals I meet if hostility toward Jews is on the
increase, nearly all of them say it is.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other voices, too. During one panel discussion on
``Switzerland and World War II,'' Francis Amar of Geneva _ a
delegate general of the International Committee of the Red Cross _
gently scolds the ``ashamed-but'' panelists. ``You keep trying to
explain,'' he says, ``why we were right to do the wrong things we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   And Cristoph Schaer, an analyst in the Swiss Foreign Service,
makes it clear with great integrity that not all Swiss are
indignant about having to face history and themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The survivors of the Shoah,'' he says, using the Hebrew term
for the destruction of European Jewry, ``are nearing the end of
their lives. They have a right to ask `why?' And we have an
obligation to answer them as honestly and respectfully as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing dispute over a Holocaust-funds settlement by Swiss
banks and the Swiss government has grown nasty. Negotiations have
given way to ultimatums, threats of sanctions, and class-action
lawsuits. Switzerland's moral failings during the Hitler years
require compensation, but it would be dreadful if the whole issue
came down to a question of dollars and cents. The Swiss banks have
offered $600 million. The World Jewish Congress and New York's
regulators are demanding $1.5 billion. But is that what matters _
the amount?
</P>
<P>
   Only bigots can benefit from monetizing the Holocaust. The
crimes of the Nazis are not reducible to a bookkeeping entry.
Neither are the betrayals of the Swiss. What decency requires of
Switzerland is not cash, but an honest accounting and a commitment
to the truth. A pot of money should not be the goal. Rewritten
history books and rectified school curricula should.
</P>
<P>
   Is it important that stolen property be returned? It is. But it
is far more important that a new generation of Swiss children not
grow up believing a falsified myth of Swiss neutrality. Or thinking
that Auschwitz tattoos are telephone numbers.

 High July mold count thanks to El Nino
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   July often is a lousy month for people who are allergic to mold,
but this year is setting records for misery.
</P>
<P>
   At this time of the year there normally would be up to 2,000
mold spores per cubic meter of air. Last week counts exceeded 3,000
spores, on Monday they rose to 4,700, and Wednesday they were above
6,000, which is ``the highest of any mold season we've seen,'' says
Dr. Thomas F. Johnson, medical director of New England Allergy,
Asthma and Immunology, a North Andover, Mass. firm that has tracked
mold counts since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Why so high? ``It's our last gasp of the El Nino effect,''
explains Johnson. ``It's a result of all the water we had this
springtime. With the dampness and heat, mold grows on the barks of
trees in the forests and wetlands. When the days are clear like
they've been the last 10 days, spores blow into the air just like
pollen blows from grass and trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all breathe it in, but if you have a mold allergy you react
exactly like you do to pollen grain if you have hay fever.''
</P>
<P>
   That reaction can range from asthma to sinusitis, hives,
swelling around the eyes, and nasal stuffiness. It already has sent
many people to the hospital and in extreme cases it can be
life-threatening. ``People should stay in air conditioning if
they're mold allergic,'' Johnson says, ``and they can take blocking
medication to prevent a reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news, the allergist adds, is that rain will wash out
the mold spores and, regardless of weather, mold counts
``inevitably will fall by the end of July. They always do.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Asthma drug studies show relief is fleeting
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Relief can come even sooner for millions of people who suffer
from exercise-induced asthma, although it may not last as long as
they hope.
</P>
<P>
   A study in the current New England Journal of Medicine, from
Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, found that the drug
salmeterol is effective in treating the common form of asthma
triggered by vigorous exercise in cold, dry air. But there were
caveats: The relief doesn't last 12 hours, as reported, although at
the beginning it can last 9 hours. That relief also wanes after
continued use to the point where, after 30 days at twice-a-day
doses, patients showed no positive effects at 9 hours although they
still got relief 30 minutes after taking the drug.
</P>
<P>
   A second study in the journal looks at montelukast, a second
potential therapy for exercise-related asthma that recently was
approved for chronic asthma. Taking the drug once a day, the
authors from several medical centers said, provides ``significant
protection'' for up to 24 hours during a 12-week period. But it
doesn't work for everyone; 23 percent of subjects experienced
complete relief, while another 25 percent had little or no
response.
</P>
<P>
   The two drugs tested are among a new generation of asthma
medicines that ``prevent attacks from even occurring because they
block the mediator that causes an asthmatic reaction,'' says
Johnson. Older drugs like albuterol treat spasms after they occur.
</P>
<P>
   But two University of Pennsylvania doctors who wrote an
accompanying editorial caution that more studies will be needed to
see how the new drugs stack up against others on the market, and to
see if they work in patients with more severe forms of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Article examines legalizing suicide
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another article in the current New England Journal offers a new
take on the hot-button issue of physician-assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   There has long been an assumption that laws to ease such deaths
would, among other things, save the US health care system lots of
money. Researchers from Boston and Salt Lake City explored that
presumption and found it sorely lacking.
</P>
<P>
   The potential savings from legalizing assisted suicide, they
wrote, ``can be predicted to be very small _ less than 0.1 percent
of both total health care spending in the United States and an
individual managed-care plan's budget.''
</P>
<P>
   They reached that conclusion after considering the experience in
the Netherlands, where euthanasia is legal, and looking at cost
data from America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real message of our article is, look, 99.97 percent of
Americans will get their same usual health care,'' Dr. Ezekiel J.
Emanuel, an oncologist at Harvard Medical School and one of the
authors of the current article, said in an interview. ``You just
can't save that much on less than .03 percent of the American
people.''

<P>
   ONSET, Mass. _ At first, the Sunday service at the old New
England camp chapel seems conventional enough. There's the
invocation, a hymn, a sermon, prayers for the sick, and some
announcements.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the On-I-Set Wigwam Spiritualist Camp, a decidedly
different kind of religious summer colony.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the ``great spirit'' is invoked, the sermon is delivered
by a medium rather than a minister, and the focus is on
spiritualism, not the Bible. The announcements are mostly messages,
believers say, sent to them from those ``in spirit'' _ that is,
from the dead.
</P>
<P>
   At almost any other regional resort, spiritualism _ the belief
that the dead can communicate with the living through psychically
attuned individuals called mediums _ might be dismissed as yet
another New Age fad. But in Onset, a beachside village in Wareham
on the way to Cape Cod, trying to communicate with the dead keeps
alive both an unusual summer colony and a local tradition rooted in
mid-19th-century America.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't know that Onset started out as a
spiritualist campground, and we're still here,'' says Mary Lou
Baumhoff of Salem, N.H., president of the Wigwam Camp. The village
was founded as a planned resort and meeting place for spiritualists
in 1877, Baumhoff says, at a time when millions of Americans were
still mourning the dead of the Civil War and when interest in
spiritualism became widespread.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years, outdoor meetings in Onset drew crowds
approaching 10,000. These days, almost 200 people visit the camp on
a few special occasions, but midsummer services as a rule attract
no more than 40 or 50 people, believers and the curious alike,
usually including some tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a spiritualist all my life, and I've been coming to
the Wigwam ever since I was 4 years old,'' says 84-year-old Ruth
Dyer of New Bedford.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the 104-year-old Wigwam Camp no longer has cottages
or tent sites but does offer twice-weekly services, along with
classes, seminars, and workshops on spiritualism. There is also a
year-round church in the village, the First Spiritualist Church of
Onset, founded in 1903. ``We belong to different spiritualist
denominations,'' says Baumhoff, ``but we're all friends.''
</P>
<P>
   All activities at the camp take place in the original chapel,
the Wigwam. Dedicated in 1894, the red-painted building is an
octagonal, shingled, single-story structure topped by a 26-foot
conical roof that intentionally resembles an Indian tepee.
``There's no other building in the world like it,'' says Baumhoff.
``During the 1938 hurricane, the Wigwam was spun completely around
and settled back on its foundations with the front door where the
back door used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The camp was founded by Mary Weston, a Boston medium and artist
who, says Baumhoff, wanted to honor the American Indian ``guides''
who so many mediums claimed had helped them contact spirits on
``the other side.'' (The camp and village are named for the same
colonial-era local Indian chief.) In particular, Weston wished to
recognize her own guide, whom she called ``Big Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the Wigwam is like going back a century. Varnished
wooden walls are adorned with photos of turn-of-the-century
spiritualist gatherings, old banners and mementos, and many
portraits of noted mediums who long ago ``went into spirit.'' Also
displayed are a number of Weston's oil paintings of Indians,
including several of a surprisingly animated Big Mountain. &UR;  &LR; A
cabinet contains a collection of slates with chalked ``spirit''
messages and drawings done by mediums who said they were relaying
communications during trances.
</P>
<P>
   The focal point of the Wigwam is ``the healing pole,'' a wooden
pillar _ decorated with beads, bunting, and a plaster statue of a
war-bonneted Indian _ around which the sick gather at services to
seek help from the great spirit. ``The pole was sensitized by
Micmac Indians when the Wigwam opened,'' says Baumhoff, ``and
rededicated by a Micmac holy man at our centennial four years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   A Wigwam service is rather matter-of-fact in tone, but offbeat
in content. After a sermon, medium Dorothy Thurlow of West Newbury
points to camp members and delivers to believers such humdrum
messages from the beyond: ``A tall white-haired man named David
sends greetings,'' and ``A man who knew you says be careful when
carrying paper money.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, a message means nothing to the person receiving it or is
so general it could apply to almost anyone. But getting a message
that hits home has been known to convert a sceptic.
</P>
<P>
   Over coffee after the service, Alice O'Brien of
Springfield, &UR;  &LR; Mass., who summers in Wareham, recounts how she
became a spiritualist eight years ago. She says she consulted a
medium who conveyed a message from a man described as having only
one finger on his right hand. ``That was my father,'' says O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't use the term `seance' much anymore,'' says Baumhoff.
``But a nonspiritualist might consider the message circle at our
services, when we contact the so-called dead, as a seance.''
</P>
<P>
   Baumhoff says the services are generally attended by more women
than men, but she insists that the spiritualist movement is not
almost exclusively female, as critics sometimes claim.
``Spiritualism isn't New Age, but many New Age people are attracted
to it now, including men,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Many Wigwam regulars, such as Baumhoff, O'Brien, and Dyer, also
belong to spiritualist churches that they attend in the offseason.
The Wigwam Camp is affiliated with the National Spiritualist
Association of Churches, largest of the 16 American spiritualist
denominations, which has 150 member churches and summer camps
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Like most spiritualists, Baumhoff says, she doesn't conceal her
beliefs but doesn't advertise them or proselytize. ``Spiritualism
is a religion of conviction, not conversion,'' she says. ``We let
people come to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wigwam Camp operates from early June through August. Classes
on spiritualism are held every Wednesday at 6 p.m., followed by a
service at 7:30 p.m. Sunday services are at 2 p.m. ``Medium Days,''
during which practitioners are available for private consulations,
are held from 1 to 3 p.m. on the second and fourth Saturday each
month of the season. The Wigwam building is open to visitors from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekends, and by appointment during the week
(508 291-0073).
</P>
<P>
   In the decades since the community's founding, the tents of the
first Onset campers gave way to trim summer cottages, handsome
housesand turreted hotels, and guest houses, most of which remain
and make Onset one of the best preserved Victorian seaside
communities in the country. Although only 96 feet in circumference,
the endearingly eccentric Wigwam has become the symbol of the
village's Victorian heyday.
</P>
<P>
   The Wigwam and its grounds and outbuildings were completely
restored by local volunteers for the camp's centennial celebration
in 1994, and the building is the only one in Onset nominated to the
National Register of Historic Places. ``We're not the least bit
embarrassed by our spiritualist beginnings,'' says Geraldine Pearle
of the Onset Protective League.
</P>
<P>
   The Wigwam Camp is credited with initiating what is now a
beloved annual Onset observance, the Harvest Moon Festival held the
first weekend in September to mark the end of the summer season.
The first festivals were organized by Weston and her followers, who
sold food and handicrafts to finance construction of the Wigwam.
``We still have the festival in the park on Onset Bluffs,
overlooking the harbor,'' says Pearle. ``In the old days, that's
also where the spiritualists had all their big events.''

KEEP THE PROUST, GIVE ME SUPERMARKET TABLOIDS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   I'm tempted to tell you that I'll be spending the summer reading
Proust, but you wouldn't believe it, would you? I didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers and magazines are full of other people's summer
reading lists. Some of the choices seem almost too literary to be
true. Boston broadcaster Christopher Lydon, for example, tells the
Globe's Names &AMP; Faces column that he plans to spend the summer
rereading, emphasis on re-, Emerson. Well, I suppose he would. So
maybe I shouldn't be so cynical and just learn to accept these
things at face value.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, by the time I've gotten through the daily papers it's
all I can do to keep up with the supermarket tabloids, especially
now, with Bruce and Demi splitting and Barbra and what'shisname
getting hitched. The Streisand wedding was either a ``cozy
ceremony'' (Star), or Barbra was ``the bride from hell'' (National
Enquirer). Take your pick.
</P>
<P>
   The unmistakable aroma of sour grapes hovers over both tabloid
accounts of the merger, doubtless because the bride sold People
magazine exclusive rights to cover the wedding for a reported $1
million. After wedding expenses, the Enquirer calculated Barbra
made a profit of $500,000 on the day. Not bad, if true. People's
reverent million-dollar coverage must be seen (and read) to be
believed, and even then ... but there I go again. When will I ever
learn?
</P>
<P>
   One of the very best things about supermarket tabloids is that,
unlike books, you can toss them out when you're done with them.
Unless you feel compelled to keep back copies piled up is little
heaps all over the floor of your office. Which brings me once again
to the crucial matter of whether Nancy Sinatra was at her father's
side when he died, as the obituary in this paper had it, or
watching the ``Seinfeld'' finale, as I claimed in a column.
</P>
<P>
   A reader asked Boston Globe ombudsman Jack Thomas to sort out
the contradiction. Thomas seemed dubious when I scrounged around
under my desk and produced month-old copies of the Star and The
National Enquirer, both of which reported Nancy's absence from her
father's side. Now here's USA Today for July 14th, with Nancy
Sinatra saying that she'd planned to visit her father the night he
died but, ```Seinfeld' reruns started prior to the `Seinfeld'
finale _ isn't this tacky? _ I got so involved watching that damn
show that I never got over to my dad's.'' So there.
</P>
<P>
   The first book on my own summer list is Diane Irons's ``The
World's Best-Kept Diet Secrets.'' I was up until midnight devouring
it, so to speak, only to conclude that some of these secrets should
have remained well-kept, this one, for example: ``If you love a
certain food, save the wrapper even after you've eaten it. You'll
trick yourself into believing you ate it. Smell it when you're
hungry. Models buy candy bars, throw away the candy and carry the
wrappers in their model's bag.'' (No wonder so many young women are
clamoring to get into modeling.)
</P>
<P>
   My second, and so far last, summer book, is Kate Summerscale's
``The Queen of Whale Cay: The Eccentric Story of `Joe' Carstairs,
Fastest Woman on Water.'' Eccentric barely begins to describe
Carstairs, heir to the Standard Oil fortune, speedboat racer,
big-game hunter, ``queen'' of her own Carribbean island. She liked
to think of her life starting where this biography begins, with
Marion Barbara Carstairs, age 5, being thrown off a bolting camel
at the London Zoo and knocked unconscious, and waking up as
``Joe.'' As a teenage ambulance driver in France in World War I,
she was seduced by Dolly Wilde, Oscar Wilde's niece. Eventually she
counted Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich among her 120 lovers. The
true love of her life, though, was a little doll, Lord Tod Wadley,
who went everywhere with her, with whom she's pictured on the
book's dustjacket. So it's not Proust. But it's a wonderful
biography.

ENTOMOLOGISTS ZAP BEETLES WITH WASPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Within an ever-widening ring around Boston, gardeners have
discovered lacquer-red beetles eating summer lilies down to their
stalks. The new arrival from Europe, which probably dodged customs
by hitching a ride on some infected lily bulbs, is a good flier and
has been found as far as 100 miles from Boston since first being
identified in Cambridge in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But while gardeners have been disgruntled, Richard Casagrande of
the University of Rhode Island was almost jaunty when he heard
about the beetles at an Entomology Society meeting. ``I bet a beer
on the spot with a colleague that we'd solve this one.''
</P>
<P>
   And the way Casagrande's research has gone, he'll be collecting
that beer soon, and we'll be able to grow lilies easily again in
three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Casagrande hopes to be able to release parasitic wasps from
France that eat lily leaf beetles _ and nothing else _ next year.
He and his graduate students have been growing and testing two
kinds of wasps in a quarantine lab in Kingston, R.I. If the federal
paperwork is completed in time, one species of tiny European wasp
may be released into a stand of lilies growing at the Massachusetts
Horticultural Society's Elm Bank in Dover next spring.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Casagrande expects the new parasites to spread
throughout the infected area in about three years, allowing
gardeners to enjoy lilies once again. ``If the wasps need some help
getting around,'' said the entomologist, ``we'll ask Mass Hort to
host `parasite giveaways.'''
</P>
<P>
   Casagrande knows he has a hot commodity, despite the fact that
his is a shoestring operation funded only by lily growers. And he
knew what he was looking for on his research trips to France.
That's because he earned his doctorate at Michigan State University
by finding a parasite to control the cereal beetle, a kissing
cousin of the lily leaf beetle. This one had also arrived from
Europe and was ripping through grain fields. ``But once we got a
parasite, it only took three years to spread through the area. We
went from devastation to no problem in five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the wonder of successful biological control, as the
technique of using a pest's natural enemies is called. It's proving
especially effective against the growing number of invasive plants
and insects that slip through customs now that international travel
and trade is commonplace. Often these new pests cause much more
trouble here than in their native lands because no native predators
have co-evolved locally to feed on them.
</P>
<P>
   So entomologists are going to the pest's native turf to find
some of its natural enemies to keep it under control here. That's
what Mark McClure at the Connecticut Agricultural Experimental
Station is trying to do with ladybugs he imported from Japan that
feed on woolly adelgid, a Japanese aphid that is killing hemlocks
here. And that's what Bernd Blossey of Cornell University did
recently when he imported European insects that are now showing
incredible success in reducing the purple loosestrife that's taken
over our wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   For a generation of entomologists less keen on insecticides than
their predecessors, biological control is an exciting alternative.
Sayles Livingston of Little Compton, R.I., who did her master's
dissertation on the lily leaf beetle under Casagrande, was
exhilarated by the project. ``Biological control is such an
up-and-coming way of dealing with insect problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But what should gardeners do to safeguard their lilies while
waiting for the parasitic wasps to arrive on the scene?
</P>
<P>
   If you're growing a small number of lilies, handpicking is best,
though you must keep it up from May through August. The bright red
beetles drop easily into a jar of bleach or alcohol held underneath
the leaf they're on. Snip off and dunk leaves that have
coral-colored lines underneath. Ditto for leaves containing the
ugly, slug-like larvae (immature beetles), which wear their own
excrement as a defense mechanism. Be sure to use gloves. The most
important thing to look for is the eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston was part of a crew that handpicked the insects at
Habitat, a Belmont, Mass. nature preserve with a policy against
pesticide use. ``When we started five years ago, it was loaded with
lily leaf beetles. Now it's hard to find any there.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to spray, Livingston recommends Neem, a newly
registered insecticide that is relatively nontoxic, based upon
extracts from the neem tree. Neem can be purchased at garden
centers under the trade names Turplex, Azatin EC, Margosan-O,
Align, and BioNeem. But it must be applied every two weeks, June
through July.
</P>
<P>
   Merit (imidacloprid) is effective as a once-a-year spring soil
drench but is not yet readily available for homeowners as it is
sold only in bulk, and few of us would need $100 worth of the
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Lily leaf beetles (liltingly known in Latin as Lilioceris lilii)
travel only about 10 miles a year under their own power and so far
are mostly confined inside the Interstate 495 ring. But some have
hitched rides to as far away as Cape Cod, Worcester, Gardner,
eastern Connecticut, southern New Hampshire, and Maine. To slow the
spread, it's important not to transport potted lily plants outside
Greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   If you live farther than 50 miles outside Boston and have lily
leaf beetles in your garden, report it to the URI Biological
Control Laboratory at 401-874-2750.
</P>
<P>
   How to recognize the beetles?
</P>
<P>
   _They look like ladybugs without spots.
</P>
<P>
   _They're half-an-inch long with an oblong, bright scarlet body
and black legs, head antennae, and undersurface.
</P>
<P>
   _They're eating your lilies. They'll also eat your fritillaria,
but not your day lilies.
</P>
<P>
   One more tip-off: If you squeeze them gently, they squeak.

PORTABLE A/CS GO ANYWHERE WITH NO SWEAT

<P>
   Q. Those portable air conditioners that do not need to be put in
a window, with a duct that goes outside. Are they OK?
</P>
<P>
   FRANCIS CURLEY, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Portable A/C units are relatively new, and expensive, but
work well enough, and have the advantage of movability from room to
room where needed. They must have a duct going to the outdoors, to
allow air exhaust and condensation to be safely disposed of. The
best thing about them is that they are on wheels, and can be easily
moved around. Anyone who has tried to mount or remove a 200-pound
window air conditioner will appreciate what a godsend a portable
unit can be.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When hydrants are flushed, the water is brown. I am told it
is not hazardous to my health (even though I would not want to
drink it anyway) but will it ruin my hot water heater or shorten
its life?
</P>
<P>
   SARAH MONTGOMERY, Wayland, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The rusty water won't hurt the water heater, but if sediment
is agitated and ends up in the tank, it could shorten its life.
Actually, sediment can enter the heater even without hydrant
flushing, and when it accumulates at the bottom of the tank, it
acts as an insulator and can cause early burnout. Therefore,
whether there is flushing or not, it's a good idea to drain a
gallon or so of water (and sediment) from the tank once a month.
This regular drainage will extend the life of the heater.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I put three coats of polyurethane varnish on a newly sanded
floor. Three months later, I see some of the poly beading up in the
seams. What happened and what can I do about it?
</P>
<P>
   SYDNEY CONTI, Amherst, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think what happened is that the varnish spanned the very
narrow seams, or filled them, then dried. When the wood expanded or
contracted (with moisture content), the wood moved but the varnish
did not, and the varnish literally broke. There is little you can
do about it until you resand and refinish. When you do, use very
thin coats of varnish (thin coats, not thinned-down varnish) and
hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   If the beading varnish is tacky, it beaded up because it did not
dry where it went deeply into the seams, between boards. There is
not much you can do about that, either, except that when you resand
and refinish, thin down the oil-based varnish with a little paint
thinner; this will allow the varnish that flows deeply into the
seam to dry properly.
</P>
<P>
   What about water-based urethane varnish? Isn't it thinner than
the oil-based stuff, and won't it go into cracks and seams better
and dry faster? It may, but with water-based varnish, you need six
or seven coats, not three; the stuff costs nearly twice as much as
oil-based, and, if it is applied too thickly, it could stay cloudy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am buying a house with 2 x 3 studs against the concrete
foundation, with friction-fit insulation between the studs. I know
there should be a plastic vapor barrier on the wall, but where
should it go: in front of or in back of the insulation?
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS CLANCY, Natick, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Any vapor barrier _ plastic, paper, or foil _ always goes on
the wall facing the basement, or in the words of insulators, facing
the heated part of the room. Put the plastic on the face of the
studs, so that when it is installed and you are in the room looking
at the wall, you will see the plastic. Cover the plastic with
plasterboard or any other wall finish such as paneling, and you
will be done with that wall.
</P>
<P>
   The 2 x 3s instead of 2 x 4s are OK, because a room below grade
does not need as much insulation as a wall above the ground.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The house I bought in 1997 has a septic system. I was advised
to have the tank pumped out once a year. There are four people in
the house, and I get the feeling that once a year is more often
than necessary. How often should the tank be pumped?
</P>
<P>
   ELLEN McCARTHY, North Easton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. With four people in the house, and with the leaching field in
good order, I think every two to five years is adequate. The
pumping not only removes liquids, but more important, solids. It
would take longer than two to five years for solids to build up in
the tank to block either the line from the house or the line from
the tank into the leaching field. If the solids do block either
inlet or outlet, you know you have to pump it out more often. Of
course, you don't want to wait until the outlet and inlet are
blocked.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband reupholstered kitchen chairs by covering the
movable seats with vinyl. They are OK, but they squeak when someone
moves on them, and I am embarrassed. What can I do to silence them?
</P>
<P>
   E.S., Winchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Sounds like a Whoopee Cushion or Larry Bird's sneakers on the
old Garden parquet. If the vinyl is really smooth and glossy, I
think there's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   You could reupholster with Naugahyde, a leather-look vinyl that
is not only not shiny but also is embossed a little to look like
real leather, which might reduce or eliminate the squeak. The
handyman has some Naugahyde-covered chair seats and does not recall
enough squeaking to be embarrassing. Or, use tapestry or other kind
of cloth cover, which will not make a sound. If neither of these
works, you have one helluva conversation piece.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The power vent on my oil-fired heater sticks out of the house
about 6 inches, 4 or 5 feet above the ground, under an overhang.
The clapboards are stained white, and that vent has stained the
siding on an area 3 by 4 feet. How can I prevent this? It is also
happening to everyone else in the area.
</P>
<P>
   MARK GAUVAIS, Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's a design failure, that's for sure, and the designer
should be sent packing. A power vent that comes out under an
overhang will guarantee staining. To cure it, try one of these
things, and the builder should do it for zilch: Extend the vent so
that it juts out 1 or 2 feet from the house, if possible and legal.
Better would be to relocate the vent above the overhang.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Ladybugs are invading my home, and they are all over the
front of the house, outside. How are they getting in the house, and
what can I do about them?
</P>
<P>
   KELLY CONGER, Foxborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Ah, the second annual invasion of the ladybugs that ate
Cleveland. Chances are that they are the multicolored Asian lady
beetle, which caused problems last year by invading houses by the
thousands. Obviously, they are doing it again. They were imported
some 80 years ago to eat aphids and other soft-bellied pests but
the introduction did not take. The current ones were probably
imported by accident by an Asian freighter in New Orleans, and they
have spread across most of the country. They are beneficial,
because they do eat pests, but their invasion of houses and
tendency to gather all over the outside of houses is a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   How do they get in? Who knows. Since a mouse can go through a
hole the size of a dime, the tiny ladybug can get in through almost
any opening.
</P>
<P>
   Sweep them up with broom and dustpan, or vacuum them and release
them outdoors. Seal all suspectedd entry places with caulking and
make sure screens are tight and intact. Be careful sweeping or
vacuuming them; if they are alarmed they may discharge a yellow
fluid that can stain walls, paint, and fabrics.
</P>

VICTORIAN COTTAGE COMES ALIVE WITH VICTORIAN COLORS

<P>
   MARBLEHEAD, Mass. -- It's only a Victorian cottage, but you
ought to see the view of Marblehead Harbor. If it weren't for the
curvature of the earth, you could see Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   And, it is a cottage in the same sense that the mansions in
Newport are cottages: It is large, with maybe 12 big rooms and
12-foot ceilings, a palatial center hallway and wonderful Victorian
colors. Unlike the Newport mansions, this one is wood framed and
covered with clapboards.
</P>
<P>
   James and Isabel Hammond moved in two years ago, into the house
that has been in Hammond's family since it was built around 1866.
It was the last of five houses that an ancestor built for his
nephews.
</P>
<P>
   Isabel Hammond said it has character but not pretention, and the
view is perfect, especially when the sun comes up over the water.
``It's all peace and quiet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While the house needed some work as all old houses do, there was
no need for demolition and rebuilding, because the structure was
intact. Structurally sound, as building inspectors might say.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't mean there was time to be idle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided a Victorian house should have Victorian colors, so
we painted the outside a blue,'' said Isabel. That is unusual for
any exterior, but situated high on a large undulating lot with the
sea three-quarters of its border, it works, especially since the
house was originally white.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Isabel continued with Victorian colors. The library she
painted purple (that's Victorian?) with sea green trim. Sounds
weird, but it, too, works, and, she added, ``We are finding that we
are spending more and more time in the library.'' In fact, all the
rooms are painted dark or bright, and with many huge windows, there
is enough light to make the colors vibrant and exciting rather than
overpowering or depressing.
</P>
<P>
   That library is a godsend, with its wall-to-wall bookcases. ``We
have 1,000 books,'' she said, adding that somehow she has to winnow
out a few. ``At my stage in life, if it cannot be used, give it
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Another room is painted orange, more properly carrot, a color
chosen by Michael, one of the Hammonds's sons. That room had some
fine old original wallpaper, but it was too far gone to save, said
Isabel, although some remains under the stairway.
</P>
<P>
   And there is original wallpaper, still being made in France, in
the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will keep that,'' Isabel said.
</P>
<P>
   The Victorian colors continue upstairs: dark blue, dark green,
and dark gray. And, the bright natural light in the house make
those colors exciting.
</P>
<P>
   One big project, other than all the painting, was to sand and
refinish the floors, which are fir, unusual for such a house.
Nicely refinished, the ``ordinary'' fir rivals the beauty of the
finest oak floors.
</P>
<P>
   And, the slate roof has to go, Isabel said. ``It's just too
expensive to redo, and the slates tend to fly off in storms, a
hazard to anyone walking the grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The house was full of furniture, but, as Isabel put it, the
furniture went when they moved in. Replacing it was not a big
problem, because the Hammonds collected many pieces from all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   James is a banker who did most of his work in Latin America,
with trips to Asia and back to New York as well. In fact, he met
Isabel in New York, although she was born in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, they traveled the world, picking up furniture and
art, more than enough to fill the Victorian cottage.
</P>
<P>
   There are English pieces, pieces from other parts of Europe, and
pieces from Asia, including a remarkable Chinese marriage bed, all
enclosed with heavy wood carvings and gold leaf bas-relief figures
of men and animals.
</P>
<P>
   There is also plenty of art, an international collection of oil
paintings, prints, woodcuts, and etchings. And, on the dining room
mantel, large china figurines of the Eight Immortals stand guard,
Chinese gods who do good deeds.
</P>
<P>
   The art continues outdoors, where a wrap-around deck presents
wonderful views of the sea from three sides. The deck roof was
removed years ago, bringing the light of the outdoors right into
the house.
</P>
<P>
   In one section of the yard, which is enhanced by huge bolders,
there is a ceramic pagoda, brought from China by James's great
aunt.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a granite pagoda, from China, and in mid-yard, for
all to see, a ship's bell, which Isabel says may be from the
clipper ship Cleopatra's Barge.
</P>
<P>
   And, tucked away in a corner, is a half-sized figure of a
coolie, very old, made of cast iron and painted.
</P>
<P>
   Isabel said the house is an ongoing project, and there is plenty
still to do, including adding to the garden.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she said, Nicholas, another of the Hammonds's three
sons, is determined to make the rocks bloom. And, he will.

THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING THERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I knew this past spring was going to be tough. In addition to
writing this column every week, I'd be actively promoting my new
book, ``Family Puzzles.'' The newly formed Marblehead (Mass.)
Cancer Prevention Project was planning a major environmental forum
for the town and I had taken on responsibility for being the
moderator.
</P>
<P>
   It was such a tightly scheduled period that I barely squeezed in
time with my grandchildren. I stopped cooking, dropped all forms of
exercise, canceled our social life, and had to make an appointment
with myself to wash my hair. I was as fully occupied as I've ever
been, pushing the limits of my physical and emotional energy.
</P>
<P>
   Then, without warning, my husband developed an aneurysm, had
brain surgery, and came home to recuperate. I struggled to recover
my footing. Two days after Jack's operation (my colleagues in the
MCPP having taken care of every detail), I stood on stage in front
of 600 people, cool as a cucumber. I also managed to make every one
of my scheduled book signings, interviews, and lectures. I was
proud of how efficiently I was making use of every minute, but I
was looking forward to a time when everything would finally slow
down. I imagined long weekends at our shelter in Vermont and lazy
afternoons at the beach with my grandchildren. I longed to get back
to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Then without warning, my son-in-law's father developed
disturbing physical symptoms and in the course of an intensely
emotional week, we found out that Terry had pancreatic cancer,
which had metastasized to his liver and lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Now Laura and Brian were away in Maine every weekend and Jack
and I were trying to help lighten their burden by pitching in when
they needed someone to look after the kids. We spent a weekend
saying goodbye to Terry and another attending the extraordinary
memorial service that his family, friends, and colleagues conducted
at the University of Maine in Augusta, where he'd been a professor
of English for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   That Saturday night, however, after my husband had fallen
asleep, I lay awake in an Augusta motel, trying to plan the coming
week. My assistant was on maternity leave. The unfinished, yet
urgent, business on my desk was beginning to resemble an
archeological dig; I wasn't sure what was there but I knew by now
it stretched back into antiquity. We were heading back first thing
in the morning because my friend Lanie and I were throwing a baby
shower for Jimmi, the young Brandeis graduate whose second child is
due in July. And on Monday, when I'd counted on getting back to
work at last, I was scheduled for jury duty.
</P>
<P>
   I had to figure out how to build some flexibility into this
crushing schedule. After several brief, excruciating headaches, my
sister Susan had just been diagnosed with three aneurysms,
unbelievable as that seems, and was in the process of scheduling
brain surgery. I had this thought: (itals)If my life is so busy
that I can't find time for my sister, this life is not worth
living.(unitals) That realization jolted me into a state of anxiety
so intense I had to wake Jack up to help me calm down.
</P>
<P>
   How did this happen? My kids are grown. I'm self-employed. If
anyone has control over her life, I'm that person. Yet, here I was
face-to-face with an unavoidable fact. The machinelike efficiency
that my pace demanded was destroying my spontaneity, my
responsiveness, and my aliveness. Having built too many things into
my life, thinking how enjoyable each one would be, I had severely
diminished my ability to take pleasure from any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Curled up on the bed, my throat so constricted with dread that
Jack had to lean over to hear me, I realized what I'd done wrong.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't left time to be available.
</P>
<P>
   Once again (Will I never learn?), I'd forgotten that there were
important activities not written in my day planner. An illness, a
death, a need, a desire; these were as crucial, if not more so,
than the items on my list. Having blithely ignored them, already
milking my time for every ``nanosecond of productivity,'' as
Richard Swenson puts it in his book, ``Margin: Restoring Emotional,
Physical, Financial, and Time Reserve to Overloaded Lives,'' I felt
overwhelmed when they were called to my attention by some power not
under my control. I'm presently revising my schedule, canceling
dates, saying no, rereading Swenson's book, and visiting Susan, who
has made a remarkable recovery. I have a new mantra I whisper to
myself.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Linda, don't just do something, be there!(unitals)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Raymond Nagem is a miniature man. He wears his white
polo shirt neatly tucked into his slacks and his brown hair cleanly
combed to the side. He pauses in reflection before he speaks,
displaying a maturity that belies his 12 years and 5-foot frame.
</P>
<P>
   But behind his compact size, neat appearance, and soft voice is
a boy who likes his music loud. His sound system towers over any
high-end, multispeaker stereo. The boom of its bass can jolt your
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Nagem, you see, plays the mammoth ``king of instruments,'' the
church organ, and has spent this week attacking the biggest, most
majestic pipe organs in Boston. The Pipe Organ Encounter, an annual
five-day overnight camp, concludes today after introducing 52
youths to the musical behemoths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to turn up the volume all the way and feel the bench
shake,'' says Nagem, who lives in Medford. ``I want to make anyone
who's down there turn their heads up and listen. It's an awesome
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the late '80s, Pipe Organ Encounters have been exposing
young people, especially budding pianists, to the might and
splendor of one of the oldest instruments. The Youth Organists
Initiative, which is hosting the Boston encounter, sprang from
concern over the marginal interest in organ playing among young
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many things are out there, screaming for our attention _
soccer, ballet, whatever,'' said Glenn Goda, co-director of Pipe
Organ Encounter in Boston. ``We in the organ world have to say this
is a viable alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first year an encounter has been held in Boston,
whose prominence in organ playing, composing, and building can be
traced to the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Three other Pipe Organ Encounter camps are being held this
summer, in Seattle; Waco, Texas; and Sioux Trails, S.D. A total of
200 students, most of them ages 12 to 18,enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   At this summer camp, kids don't gather around a fire singing
``Blackbird'' to the strains of a guitar. Here, they circle around
organists tackling Bach's Toccata in D Minor.
</P>
<P>
   As 11-year-old Randy Santini sends his fingers gamboling along
the Flentrop organ at Harvard University's Adolphus Busch Hall, his
shoes seem barely to touch the pedals. Other students can't
reconcile what they see _ a 4-foot-11-inch boy _ and what they hear
_ the complicated, familiar toccata that reaches the depths of
one's heart. ``No, that's not him playing, is it?'' one girl asks.
</P>
<P>
   Santini, of North Weymouth, gets paid to perform local concerts
and has been called a prodigy, according to his father, Paul, a
bandleader. ``But I don't see it,'' says dad. ``To me, he's just a
kid who gets grounded a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pipe Organ Encounter, students take private lessons from
Boston-area organists, visit organ shops, attend concerts, and
indulge in ``organ crawls,'' from one outstanding local church
organ to another. Sometimes the students are permitted to try a few
bars on the instrument. Think of it as bar hopping for the
underaged and musically talented.
</P>
<P>
   During her lesson at First Church in Cambridge, Caty Sumner, 15,
first delivers a frolicky tune that requires a dancelike shuffle of
her feet. Her old Birkenstocks have been tossed onto the floor in
favor of the traditional organ shoes with smooth leather soles,
which easily slide along the giant pedals. She pulls the stops _
sets of knobs that flank the keyboards _ to open additional pipes
behind her. She maneuvers her hands from one keyboard to another.
Her long and loose limbs seem suited for operating the huge battery
of pedals, buttons, keys, and switches.
</P>
<P>
   When she practices Bach's ``Ich ruf zu dir Herr Jesu Christ,''
her teacher, Carl Klein, dances behind her. He switches from her
left to right side, pulling and pushing the stops, searching for
the sound he wants. He lightly touches the small of her back, and
Sumner, as if on reflex, straightens it to an arrow. He walks down
to the pews and bows his head, listening to the acoustics in the
dimly lit church.
</P>
<P>
   After the lesson, Sumner takes multiple snapshots of the stately
organ at rest. She says she does this at every organ she plays.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Sumner's heard all the jokes. Organists ``play with their
feet'' (referring to the keyboard pedals on the floor), jam to
church hymns, and sport those cutesy black pointy shoes _ but with
pride. ``It's countercultural,'' says Klein, an organist at
University Lutheran Church in Cambridge. ``We live in a secular
society. Organ music is usually associated with church music, so
you get that stigma attached to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sumner is a member of the ``Organ Geeks,'' a close-knit group of
young organists around the country. The name was bestowed at a Pipe
Organ Encounter in 1995 by University of Pennsylvania students who,
spotting the group around campus, would yell, ``There go the organ
geeks!''
</P>
<P>
   Some Organ Geeks have now been to three or four encounters, even
though the camps were originally intended for beginning players.
``The Organ Geeks only get five days a year when we can be
together,'' Sumner says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun catching up with each other on what we've been doing
over the past year, the concerts we've been to, etc.,'' says Matt
Emkay, 17, of Wyomissing, Pa. ``It's great to hear people your age
making music. At home, we don't have friends who are organists.
This is the interest that makes us special.''
</P>
<P>
   The Geeks try rebelling against the lights-out rule in their
Boston University dorm, staying up in each other's rooms to sing
Bach fugues. They publish the year-round Organ Geek Newsletter and
send copies to 25 dues-paying members. They trade organ music, brag
about getting their pictures taken with famous organist Diane Bish,
speak breathlessly about the ``wicked loud'' pipes of certain
organs they've played.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Encounter co-director Mary Sue Willie says drawing young
organists together from around the country for five days is the
ultimate reward. ``It's a terrific high,'' she says. ``Most of them
are pretty lonely. ... No one understands them.''

FROM CAMP COMPLAINTS TO COMPROMISING ON PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What do you do if your child gets stuck with a hellion for a
bunkmate at overnight camp?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Consider the timing of the complaint. If you're hearing about
it during the first week, most directors consider it part of the
settling-in process. Be empathetic nonetheless, but take it more
seriously if it persists beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first question I'd ask is, `How much is this bothering
you?''' says psychologist Bruce Muchnick of Glenside, Pa., who
consults to camps. ``The second question is, `How much is it
bothering other kids?' There may be a coping skill she can copy.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how she answers those questions, your best strategy is
to empower her _ ``What do you think you can do?'' ``Have you
talked to the counselor?'' _ at the same time you support her:
``How can we help?'' As with many issues at camp, some kids feel
better as soon as they hang up from talking to you (although you
may feel worse). Even if you think your child is overreacting, a
lack of sympathy will make him feel unsupported. ``Whether he's
overreacting or not, it's real for him,'' says Muchnick.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely call the director, says Barnes Boffey, a family
counselor and director of Camp Lanakilia, a boys camp in Vermont.
Expect a director to offer to brainstorm an action plan with your
child. ``You don't want kids to think they call Mom and Dad and
problems get fixed by magic,'' he says. ``They need to see the
process work.'' For him, helping kids learn how to work out
interpersonal differences is what camp is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Once your child is getting help, Boffey says it's OK to ask her
to tough it out for a few days to see if things get better. But
only for a few days. Expecting her to tough it out for any longer
is asking for trouble, he says. If she's miserable, bring her home.
</P>
<P>
   And what if the director reports back that, yes, your child
described the situation accurately, but he, the director, doesn't
think it's a big deal?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's a value judgment,'' says Boffey. You may be willing
to go along with a director who brushes off bad language or poor
hygiene, but what about racial epithets, bullying, or hitting?
``The moment you feel uncomfortable leaving your child there
because you don't trust the director's values or think your child
is not safe, you need to go get him,'' says Boffey.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufdots &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's a good response when your child says, ``Don't tell
Dad/Mom''?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. When kids under 5 make this request, it's a way for them to
feel in control, says child psychologist Louise Guerney, a
specialist in parent-child relationships and professor emeritus at
Penn State University. It's OK to go along in an exaggerated,
game-like way, as long as somewhere along the line you say, ``You
know, if it's something serious, I can't keep it a secret from
Daddy.'' With this age, though, the secret is usually innocuous.
</P>
<P>
   By school age, it may not be, and your child's motive for not
wanting you to tell probably isn't either. He may be afraid of
punishment or of facing a parent's disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying message to convey to children of all ages is that
parents don't have secrets from each other about their children.
``It undermines the parenting process,'' says Guerney. She
recommends saying, ``I can't make that promise in advance. If it's
really important, I have to tell Daddy.'' Young children will most
acquiesce but a child 8 or older may feel betrayed and clam up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may feel like you are cutting off communication, and it
may feel to your child like you are leaving him high and dry,''
says Guerney. ``Stress that you will use your judgment _ `Can you
trust me to decide after I hear?' _ and offer alternatives: `If you
don't want to tell me, is there some other adult you can talk
to?''' If you have a spouse who typically overreacts and your child
has reason to be fearful, acknowledge it: ``I know Dad sometimes
comes down too hard, but I can't make that promise until I know
what it's about. Can we evaluate the situation together after I
have the information?''
</P>
<P>
   When an older child's request not to tell is frequent, it can be
a red flag that there's an underlying problem in a relationship.
Sometimes just making your spouse aware is all it takes to reopen
communication. Other times, professional intervention may help.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufdots &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I read your column last week (on competition) with interest.
Do you have advice concerning my 9-year-old son? He cannot
participate in any game or activity without winning. If he loses,
he is immediately in a bad mood for the next hour. This applies to
playing a family board game or shooting baskets in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A child this age who's a poor sport is at risk for losing
friends and becoming more and more unhappy as time goes on. Marty
Block, an associate professor of education at the University of
Virginia, offers these suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   _Make sure you model good sportsmanship yourself and point out
examples of it when you see it. Make it clear you don't admire bad
sports, not even in professionals. Talk about how other kids don't
like poor sports, either.
</P>
<P>
   _Talk about what it feels like to win and to lose. Acknowledge
that it feels better to win but stress the positives that can come
from losing gracefully, like gaining respect in a playmate's eyes,
identifying a weakness so you can work on it, or giving another
person a chance to feel good about himself.
</P>
<P>
   _Make sure he's in situations where teamwork and cooperation are
rewarded. Praise him when he exhibits those qualities, even if all
you can see is that he's trying harder.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the ways to help a poor loser, Block likes natural
consequences the best. ``If his sulking gets him lots of attention,
it's getting rewarded, even though it's negative attention,'' he
says. Avoid this by establishing consequences before you play: ``We
want to play with you, but it spoils our fun if you can't be a good
sport. If you lose and sulk, you need to go to your room.'' Or:
``If you can't be a good sport this time, next time we won't
include you.'' Follow through with the consequences firmly and
without fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   While he's sulking in his room, if you happen to do something he
would have enjoyed, tell him afterward: ``It's too bad you were
sulking. You missed out on ice cream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of natural consequences that get fast
results,'' quips Block.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufdots &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The mothers of my 6-year-old's new friends would prefer to
drive 10 miles to a park than have the kids play on the swings and
treehouse in our back yard, or go to an indoor arcade instead of
playing in our attic, which is filled with toys. On beautiful days,
``How about a nature hike?'' is met with, ``The boys should rest
before soccer'' which is before baseball ... My husband and I don't
believe in all this for 6-year-olds. Am I heading my son toward
nerdville? Should I cave?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Not cave, but compromise, says Diane Levin, a professor of
early childhood education at Wheelock College who is nationally
recognized for her work on children's play. There's no question the
opportunities you're providing are better for any child's
development. ``These mothers aren't giving them the chance to
direct their own play, which is what kids need at this age,'' says
Levin. ``The more they're programmed, the more they need to be
programmed and expect excitement to be created for them.''
</P>
<P>
   But while it's important for children to have what Levin calls
old-fashioned play where they use their imagination, make their own
rules, and stretch themselves creatively, you're right to sense
that sticking to your guns totally could isolate your son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pick out the least offensive activities these mothers do with
their boys and involve your son a little with them,'' she says.
``In the meantime, find other playmates whose parents' values mesh
with yours.''
</P>
<P>

HUGE PERSONAL DEBT MAY COST CELLUCCI AT POLLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN C. MOONEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For a politician known to vacillate on some issues,
Acting Governor Paul Cellucci is remarkably resolute on one matter:
He won't be interviewed about his personal finances this year.
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly has rejected requests for interviews about the
$700,000-plus monkey on his back, most recently last week when he
turned down the Globe's second formal request in two months.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci describes this as ``an old story.'' But it's one that
bears updating since the Globe reported in 1996 that he owed
$750,000, nearly $70,000 on credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   It's significant because Cellucci, over the past 25 years, has
systematically mortgaged his assets to sustain a lifestyle he
apparently could not afford. Today, everything he owns is mortgaged
to or near the hilt. Habitual borrowing unleashes mathematical
forces, which become almost irreversible and now require Cellucci
each month to pay several thousand dollars in interest alone.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it must be embarrassing for Cellucci to explain how
he's become so deeply in debt despite a comfortable family income
which averaged almost $130,000 annually over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   But his explanations in the past have never added up. Two years
ago, he detailed perhaps half of the total loan burden he's
amassed. He says he pays all his bills on time and insists his
assets are worth more than his liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   That's his story, and he's sticking to it. Maybe it will
suffice.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that a relatively small fraction of voters will
consider his financial fiasco a disqualifier-type issue when they
go to the polls. The risk for Cellucci, however, is that his
apparent incompetence in managing his own finances creates one of
those gnawing ``What's going on here?'' issues that other voters,
maybe many, will weigh among other factors.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe's request for an interview last week will not be the
last time he will be asked about his debts between now and the
election. The issue could arise in a debate or news story.
</P>
<P>
   Few will argue that Cellucci is a threat to mismanage state
finances. He isn't. The state is running a $1 billion surplus. Even
if the economy goes south, taking state revenues with it,
administration and finance Secretary Charles D. Baker runs that
part of the show. His ability is unquestioned.
</P>
<P>
   But it's legitimate for voters to consider the degree to which
Cellucci's chronic personal overspending reflects on his judgment
in the most basic of responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci has claimed he fell into a hole because of $130,000 in
home renovations, $100,000 in private school tuitions over a
decade, and a temporary drop in income after he became lieutenant
governor and gave up his part-time law practice.
</P>
<P>
   But he is clearly a man who has lived beyond his means, and not
merely in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   The long slow slide into a financial morass began 24 years ago
when his parents gave Cellucci and his wife an acre lot on Lincoln
Street in Hudson. They borrowed $22,500, and four years later
refinanced for $31,000. A year after that, they began taking
additional equity out in a series of second mortgages, each
progressively larger, starting at $10,000, then $18,000 in 1980,
$45,000 three years after that, and, finally, $60,000 shortly
before they sold the house for $115,000 in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began a pattern of Cellucci borrowing against assets, which
precipitated the $70,000 runup on credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   These are not isolated emergencies. When he consolidated three
mortgages on his current Brigham Street home in 1992 for $314,000,
more than a third of the principal was equity taken out of the
property. It had not been used to ``to buy, build or improve'' his
home, according to his most recent tax returns, which he releases
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a vacant lot in Hudson was a gift from his parents
and brother. He borrowed $100,000 against it. When he sold it in
1994 for $150,000, he netted only a few thousand dollars after
paying off the loan, taxes, and fees.
</P>
<P>
   He estimates the fair market value of his 22 percent share of
Cellucci Hudson Corp., the family's commercial real estate
business, at $300,000 to $350,000. Most, if not all, of that is
mortgaged to secure one bank loan worth well over $200,000, plus
another used to pay off the $70,000 in credit card debt.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all that, Cellucci still owes more than $100,000 for a
bank loan unsecured by any collateral at all, according to his most
recent financial disclosure report.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be nice if we could all get one of those?
</P>
<P>
   Basically, Cellucci is breaking up the furniture to keep the
fire going. In the past three years, the family business has sold
two properties, representing a third of its holdings. That
generated some onetime income for our acting chief executive, but
had little impact on his debt total.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever deep pockets Cellucci once had are now about empty. He
owns no other stock with a value of more than $1,000, according to
his state financial disclosure forms. Based on his tax returns last
year, he had an average daily balance of several thousand dollars
in an interest-bearing bank account. He has a pot of retirement
funds set aside for the future (he's 50), but his tax returns show
he also redeemed a life insurance policy, with a cash value of
$7,666, last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci blames the sacrifice of giving up his law practice as
one of the fundamental causes of his financial predicament.
</P>
<P>
   But the vast majority of his constituents would consider
themselves well off indeed if they had his income of the last
decade, even in the supposedly low-earnings years.
</P>
<P>
   In the three years before he became lieutenant governor,
Cellucci averaged about $115,000 per year. For the past four years,
Cellucci and his wife declared average adjustable gross income of
$184,175. In between were his first three years in office when he
took the short-term income hit. Even during that time, 1991-93, the
Celluccis averaged $96,719 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters making much less will be forgiven if they look at
Cellucci's debt and wonder: What's going on here?

CNN LOSES BATTLE, BUT KEEPS SPOILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the smoke cleared on CNN's ``Operation Tailwind,'' story,
almost all the casualties were from friendly fire. The network's
now-retracted report alleging that US forces used deadly nerve gas
on a 1970 mission in Laos cost three producers their jobs; damaged
the reputation of star correspondent Peter Arnett; raised questions
about the stewardship of CNN/US president Rick Kaplan; and wounded
a network that had been known for straight, solid journalism.
</P>
<P>
   But what about collateral damage done to CNN and its vital
relationship to the Pentagon? The Department of Defense is
certainly angry about charges that it unleashed the same weapon
that the United States has demonized Saddam Hussein for using. And
retired Major General Bill Nash, a visiting lecturer at Harvard's
Shorenstein Center, said that after years of Pentagon/press
detente, the Tailwind report ``caused a flashback to the days of
old'' when those relations were poisonous.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems logical that CNN should expect a Pentagon backlash.
Yet, military and media experts said that no matter how angry the
department may be, CNN won't pay a major price for Tailwind. In a
case of pragmatism trumping ideology, the Pentagon knows it still
needs CNN and is smart enough to recognize a public relations
windfall when it sees one.
</P>
<P>
   CNN ``has heard from the highest levels of the Pentagon that
there will be no impact,'' said a network spokesman, Steve Haworth.
``If our relationship survived Peter Arnett ... in Baghdad, it will
certainly survive this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you the Department of Defense has a tremendous
respect for CNN,'' said a Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel
Bill Darley. ``And the respect is ongoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath those official pleasantries is more than a grain of
truth. For one thing, CNN's respected Pentagon correspondent Jamie
McIntyre _ who had no role in developing the Tailwind story _ won
friends in the military by writing a memo questioning the piece
before it aired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Covering the Pentagon is sort of personality dependent, not
institution dependent,'' said CBS Pentagon correspondent David
Martin. Because McIntyre distanced himself from Tailwind, Martin
added, ``I think if anything, it's probably improved their ability
to cover the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the reality that the Pentagon can't afford to
alienate a resource like CNN, which functions not only as a 24-hour
news outlet, but as an intelligence service. ``I think there will
be a certain atmospheric attitude toward CNN over'' at the
Pentagon, said retired general and NBC military consultant Bernard
Trainor. But the network won't incur serious penalties, he said,
because ``CNN's too important to the whole equation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the military, CNN is very important, maybe more than CNN
knows'' said Jack Galvin, dean of Tufts's Fletcher School of Law
and Diplomacy and former supreme allied commander in Europe. In his
military headquarters, Galvin says, ``CNN was on in there all the
time . ... That might be the first indicator that something might
be wrong somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, CNN did not escape unscathed. Even if Tailwind did no
permanent damage to the network's standing at the Pentagon, many
veterans seem less forgiving. ``The place where it has lasting
impact is among vets,'' said CBS's Martin. ``There is a body of
people who see the Jane Fonda-Ted Turner-Peter Arnett conspiracy.''
Sure enough, a posting on the Web site of the Special Operations
Association vigorously attacks the troika of ``Tailwind Ted, Hanoi
Jane, and their pal Baghdad Pete.''
</P>
<P>
   But observers said the Pentagon itself is likely to respond to
Tailwind by choosing an option it rejected in Vietnam: declaring
victory and calling a truce. After CNN hired attorney Floyd Abrams
and his investigation revealed serious flaws in the nerve gas
story, the network humbled itself, handing the department a big
public relations victory in the battle for hearts and minds. That
vindication will be heightened when the Pentagon's own
investigation of the Tailwind charges, to be released soon,
concludes that the nerve gas story is unsupportable.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Major General Neal Creighton, president of the McCormick
Tribune Foundation, which promotes understanding between the
military and media, said this was another credibility-sapping
fiasco for journalists. ``The one who suffers from (Tailwind),'' he
said, ``is the press side of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash predicted that Pentagon spokesman ``Ken Bacon is going to
take the high road.'' CNN ``certainly called it like Abrams saw
it.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC Pentagon correspondent Jim Miklaszewski suggested that
Tailwind finally lets the defense department get payback from the
media decades after the press was credited with turning public
opinion against the war in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's almost a feeling of vindication in this building,'' he
said. ``A feeling that maybe we didn't get Vietnam entirely
correct, but neither did you.''

POLISHING METALLICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Change is not always a metalhead's best friend. Despite the
ostensibly rebellious, boundary-breaking nature of the genre, many
fans like what they know and want to keep liking that throughout a
group's life span. The more vigilant among the metal hordes are
always sniffing the winds for the whiff of a band's sellout, a
taming of the beast.
</P>
<P>
   With a shrug of ``so what?'' America's top heavy-metal band,
Metallica, took those notions by the shoulders and gave them a good
shake four years ago with their so-called ``black'' album,
``Metallica.'' They continued to do so with ``Load'' and
``Re-Load.'' They're slated to release a new album late in the
year. Singer-guitarist James Hetfield, guitarist Kirk Hammett,
drummer Lars Ulrich, and bassist Jason Newsted committed heresy in
1996 when they cut their manes short and headlined the alternative
rock-oriented Lollapalooza tour.
</P>
<P>
   So Metallica, formed in San Francisco in the early 1980s, is not
the all-thrash, all-speed, all-anger, all-bark-and-bite band it
once was _ not that its members don't cherish their history and
kick much of it up when they get on stage -- usually to sold-out
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica has grown more melodic and it has explored musical
subtleties and other styles _ country, blues, power ballads. The
most moving song on ``Re-Load'' is the bittersweet tower-of-power
ballad ``The Unforgiven II,'' with Marianne Faithfull contributing
haunting backing vocals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another dynamic,'' says Hammett. ``It's just another
way to write a song, something different. A lot of the appeal, for
us, is to create songs like that because everyone says we can't:
`We are a metal band. We have to have 182-beats-per-second.' People
are so rigid in their thinking, that you know (itals)of
course(unitals) we're gonna think otherwise. And that in itself was
appealing to us. It also gives James an opportunity to actually
(itals)sing(unitals) and why not showcase that? ... We might have
changed our sound and, to certain people, we may have lost our
sound. But I think it's healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that when Metallica formed, its intense, cathartic
speed-metal ran counter to the prevailing pop-metal of the day. It
was an underground sound, rough and uncompromising, hard as nails,
bitter as bark. ``Master of Puppets'' and ``Ride the Lightning''
were classic against-the-grain albums. A contrary nature courses
through the band's blood.
</P>
<P>
   The early Metallica was an intense, but, internally, a somewhat
rickety, machine, prone to excess. It was derailed in 1986 when
bassist-songwriter Cliff Burton died in a band bus accident in
Sweden. Just two months later, Hammett told the Globe, ``We all
felt there was no reason to stop. What Metallica has been all about
is struggling. The odds have always been against us, but it worked
out and we're back in action.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years down the road, Hammett says, ``I wish I knew what I
know now back then. Way back then, you were kind of figuring it out
as you went along. And now, we are, you know, the `wizened,
experienced' band. We know what to do and what not to do as far as
the show is concerned, because the show is the A-No.1 concern.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Metallica do differently now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, one thing is like, you need sleep,'' he says. ``You need
rest. That much is obvious. And another one is drinking too much.
If you drink too much it affects the show the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Note: Metallica's self-imposed nickname was Alcoholica.
</P>
<P>
   The guys in Metallica are rock stars, yes, but rather
self-effacing ones. Hammett volunteers that he recently fell on
stage while performing. ``So what?'' he says. ``Everyone falls
down. I just kind of kicked back, had a good laugh at my own
expense.''
</P>
<P>
   As if the band is composed of four human beings, not four rock
robots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly,'' says Hammett. ``More human. We see ourselves as
normal people who interact in the same way everyone else interacts.
That's been no big secret. That really hasn't changed much. ... We
nudge each other a lot. It's fun for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Metallica's concerts are affairs that last more than two hours.
This tour is somewhat stripped down, not the ultimate big-bang
Metallica experience. ``Not anything grandiose,'' Hammett says,
adding that pyrotechnics are involved but not overdone. ``They're
just for augmented dynamics.''
</P>
<P>
   Musically, he says, ``What we try and do is pace it so we create
a scenario where at the top of the set we play the songs that draw
the listener in, just totally attack, and then we slow it down
toward the middle, so it isn't so drastic a change from the heavy
fast stuff to the more ballad-y stuff. Then, two-thirds of the way,
we pick up the energy level and just keep increasing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Does it ever become a paint-by-numbers situation?
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends,'' says Hammett, ``on the environment. If the
audience is great, the sound is great, the PA's happening, the
monitors are good, we're all well-rested, it's magic. We are as
one. When things are less than ideal, you just have to rise above
it. (Although) it's always more noticeable to the band. I've walked
away from shows thinking `God, that was horrible' and then our
managers come running back saying it's the best show we've played
in a long time. Then, you start thinking: `Why the disparity? What
made it so appealing to everyone else?' It's nothing you can put a
finger on, just a combination of things that make or break a
show.''

IS IT FINALLY MONTGOMERIE'S YEAR?

<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ For Colin Montgomerie, who has finished
second three times in the US Open, the 127th British Open should be
his oyster. He has been Europe's dominant player the past five
years and is a native son, but his only top-10 finish has been a
joint eighth in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The record also shows he has failed to make the cut four of the
last six years when he has been in his prime. His approach to this
year's championship has been almost casual. Nine holes Tuesday
night. Nine holes Wednesday morning. Some corporate appearances.
The practice tee, where he will simply try to find a rhythm. If the
wind blows too hard, he'll pack it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried not to put too much pressure on myself,''
Montgomerie said. ``I'm coming in here playing OK. I just thought I
would play nine holes (Wednesday) morning. That's been my
preparation; I'll go practice (Wednesday) afternoon just very
briefly, and go back to my hotel room and rest. I feel whenever I
have relaxed in the past I've done well in any tournament. I'm
trying to treat this as near to any tournament as I possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie said he's at the peak of his game. ``I think I'm
better all around,'' he said. ``I think my course management is
better. I think it's important here to know when to hit a driver
and when to hit a 2-iron and when to go to the middle of the green
and when not to. That's what I tend to pride myself on. Generally,
at these tournaments, par down the last few holes is always quite
good. You have to know where to place your ball to make par.''

DEFENDER LEONARD TAKES A LONG LOOK AT ROYAL BIRKDALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SOUTHPORT, England _ The walk to the 18th green in the final
round of the British Open with victory in hand is one of the finest
trips in all of golf. Justin Leonard had such a walk a year ago at
Royal Troon on the Ayrshire coast of Scotland by the Firth of
Clyde. He earned it by carving out a masterful 65 and stormed from
five shots back on an afternoon when none of the other contenders
could break 70.
</P>
<P>
   That's how you win major championships, and that's what Leonard
did at Royal Troon. It was his first victory in a major and, at 25,
it has taken the pressure off, leaving him completely at ease as he
participates in the 127th British Open Championship at Royal
Birkdale.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Leonard is an intense competitor out of the mold of
Texas predecessors Ben Hogan, Byron Nelson, Ben Crenshaw, and Tom
Kite, he no longer has to live up to the monicker of ``the best
player never to have won a major.''
</P>
<P>
   That's on the table for Colin Montgomerie, Phil Mickelson, and
David Duval to cope with at the start of the game's oldest
championship. ``They have to live up to their own goals and
expectations,'' said Leonard Wednesday. ``I'm sure those goals and
expectations are probably higher than what people think of them.''
That's a monkey Leonard removed from his back well before he made
it to 30, which was where Kite and Davis Love resided when they won
that elusive first major.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a bit more at ease,'' Leonard said. ``I'm sure part of
that is because I expect a lot but I feel more comfortable being
here. It's the same way I felt at the PGA last year and the Masters
and US Open this year. I've felt a little more relaxed because I
had accomplished something at this level and it feels like part of
the pressure from playing before this tournament last year is gone
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, whose final tuneup was in the Greater Hartford Open two
weeks ago in Cromwell, Conn., followed pretty much the same routine
he did a year ago when he arrived at Royal Troon, a course he'd
never seen. He played 80 holes in a practice regimen.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas native had never seen Royal Birkdale until he arrived
here last Saturday. He's played 77 holes on the course in the
company of dependable caddie Bob Riefke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two courses are different,'' said Leonard. ``The greens
here have a lot more undulation. They're a little bigger. And at
Troon you went out and then back except for the eighth hole. Here
you have holes going every which way. It's different, but this is a
wonderful course. You don't need a lot of drivers if you don't want
to. I hit a lot of irons off the tees. The wind died down a bit
today, but if it stays windy I think par is going to be a
reasonable score.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard essentially won at Royal Troon on the incoming nine of
the first round when he put together a 35 in high winds that
buffeted the course. That kept him in the hunt. On Sunday, he
started out the round five shots astern of Sweden's Jesper Parnevik
and beat him by three. He didn't hit a single green in regulation
on the back nine Thursday and finished with a marvelous par on the
18th. On that hole he found the rough off the tee, played out with
an 8-iron, hit a 4-iron into the wind, and made an 8-foot putt to
save par.
</P>
<P>
   The back nine on Sunday was an example of Leonard's true grit.
He saved par on the 10th, birdied the 16th from 15 feet, and made
the putt that iced it on the 17th from 30 feet. ``I definitely knew
that I wanted to win a major,'' said Leonard. ``I hadn't really
contended, but I had played well in some majors. I just feel more
comfortable now because I'm not saying, `Well maybe this could be
the week.''' It wasn't his week at The Olympic Club in the US Open,
but Leonard handled it in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty confident going in,'' he said. ``I'd been
playing OK, had a good week before. When I got out there, I didn't
play all that great. I hit the ball fairly well, but it was not a
very good week putting. It was disappointing, but as I said those
weeks don't bother me as much as they did maybe last year or two
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard was runner-up to Love in the PGA Championship at Winged
Foot, came from five shots back to win The Players Championship at
Sawgrass two weeks before the Masters, and is at peace with himself
as he prepares for Royal Birkdale. ``I don't put too much into the
week before or even into the two or three days prior to it,'' he
said. ``I'm out there trying to learn the golf course, trying to
pick out the right shots to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   He picked out the right shots at Royal Troon and hopes for a
repeat here on the coast of the Irish Sea.

DEBATE ON RIGHT TO SUE HMOS SWELLS IN CAPITOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ When Diane Andrews-Clark sued her insurance
company for denying medical care to her husband, it came as little
surprise that a judge dismissed the case. Under federal law, most
workers have only a narrow right to sue their health insurers.
</P>
<P>
   But what caused a buzz in legal circles was the emotional lament
by US District Judge William Young in Boston about the the law that
had forced him to throw the case out. While the insurer's alleged
conduct ``is extraordinarily troubling,'' Young wrote last October,
``even more disturbing to this court is the failure of Congress to
amend'' the law.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many lawmakers want to do just that. Their effort has
sparked one of the biggest debates in Congress this session and
become the major point of contention as lawmakers and President
Clinton negotiate for broad new rights for the 75 percent of
Americans who rely on health maintenance organizations and other
managed care companies for health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding the right to sue an HMO is a top goal for consumer
groups and doctors, who argue that the threat of legal action will
make HMOs more accountable for their decisions. Right-to-sue
provisions are the key difference between the leading Democratic
``patients rights'' bill, which would allow patients to sue, and
the two main Republican proposals, which would continue the
prohibitions on most HMO lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The issue took on even more prominence Wednesday as Senate
Republicans unveiled a new bill that requires HMOs to give patients
certain benefits but does not expand the right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the current limits on lawsuits also arose as
President Clinton met Wednesday at the American Medical Association
with a small group of doctors, nurses and families with complaints
about HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   The current law, passed in 1974, allows patients to sue an
insurer only for the cost of a denied benefit. For example, a
person denied a cancer treatment can sue to force an HMO to provide
the service or to repay a patient who paid for the service out of
pocket. But the patient may not sue for suffering, lost wages or
any other damages, even if the lack of treatment allowed the cancer
to spread.
</P>
<P>
   These limitations apply only to people who obtain health
insurance from their employers, or about 125 million Americans, and
they mostly affect people in HMOs or other plans that require
preapproval for specialized care. Congress approved the limitations
at a time when fewer than 6 million people were in HMOs, compared
to a significant majority of Americans today.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the right to sue say it will make sure HMOs put
patients before profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the HMO industry is the only industry that doesn't
have to compensate people for the harm it causes, HMOs will
continue to have every financial incentive to deny essential
care,'' said Ronald Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a
health care consumers group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians have been held accountable for time immemorial,''
said James Stacey, a spokesman for the American Medical
Association. ``Now, some health plans are making medical decisions.
We feel the right to sue acts as a safety valve for patients, which
will result in better decision-making by medical plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies, however, say that new lawsuits would raise
the cost of health premiums, making policies unaffordable and
forcing employers to cut benefits they offer to workers.
</P>
<P>
   One study commissioned by the American Association of Health
Plans found that changing the liability laws alone would raise
premiums by between 2.7 percent and 8.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A separate study by Coopers &AMP; Lybrand, which examined health
plans serving employees who already have the right to sue,
concluded that the cost of litigation was between three and 13
cents a month per beneficiary, or no more than 0.11 percent of
premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have said that a better appeals process would help
patients while avoiding expensing litigation costs.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, said Americans would
rather appeal than sue over HMO decisions. The Democratic solution
``is to bring a government bureaucrat and a lawyer into the
examining room,'' he said. ``But that hardly solves the problem
that most Americans have, because when they're examined by their
doctor, they want to be alone with their doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, some patients have already felt the effects of
the limitiations on lawsuits contained in the 1974 law, called the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA.
</P>
<P>
   Young was not the first judge to complain about the law, but the
strong tone of his comments has caused a stir among lawyers who
follow employee benefit issues, said Robert Macaulay Jr. of the
Boston firm Ropes &AMP; Gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an extraordinary piece,'' Macaulay said. ``It's not
common to see an opinion that strong. I've never seen another case
quite like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Young's decision concerned the 1994 death of Richard J. Clarke
of Haverhill, Mass., a 41-year-old father of four with a drinking
problem. Through his wife's job at AT&AMP;T Corp., Clarke obtained
health insurance from The Travelers Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   Three times in 1994, Clarke was admitted or referred by a court
to an alcohol detoxification program. Each time his insurer refused
to authorize a 30-day stay, even though his policy entitled him to
one 30-day inpatient rehabilitation program each year, Young's
decision said.
</P>
<P>
   One time the insurer authorized a five-day stay, and another
time allowed no more than eight days, the decision said. The third
time, following a commitment hearing, a court ordered Clarke into a
30-day detoxfication program, but the insurer ``incredibly
refused'' to cover the stay, Young's decision said. As a result,
the state court sent Clarke to the Southeast Correctional Center at
Bridgewater, Mass. for the treatment. There, Clarke was forcibly
sodomized by another inmate and received little treatment, Young
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke's life ``spiralled inexorably down and out of control''
after his time in Bridgewater, Young wrote, and in November 1994 he
was found dead in a parked car, with a garden hose extending from
the tailpipe to the passenger compartment.
</P>
<P>
   Young dismissed the suit filed by Clarke's wife, but added that
this resolution was ``of course, ridiculous. The tragic events set
forth in Diane Andrews-Clarke's complaint cry out for relief.'' He
said it was wrong for the insurer to deny treatment that ``doctors
at several hospitals, and even the courts of the Commonwealth'' had
said was needed.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law, Young wrote, has ``evolved into a shield of
immunity that protects health insurers, utilization review
providers, and other managed care entities from potential liability
for the consequences of their wrongful denial of health benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   But the health insurance industry says that more lawsuits will
not improve the country's health care system. Health plans point to
studies showing that the current malpractice law leads to higher
medical costs and a breakdown of trust between doctors and
patients.

YANKEE FANS, DON'T WORRY, BE HAPPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Don't worry, New York Yankees fans. Be happy.
</P>
<P>
   Why that doesn't go without saying is one of the mysteries of
the universe, like Kim Basinger winning an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are churning out an epic tale that makes the book
that manager Joe Torre spun off the 1996 season, ``Chasing the
Dream,'' read as if it had been ghost-written by Kafka. Here is a
team in the throes of living a dream too vivid and sublime not to
be real.
</P>
<P>
   If the government operated as engagingly and efficiently as the
Yankees, there would be no Internal Revenue Service. People would
pay their taxes willingly, with a smile, without waiting for April
15 to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Barely halfway into the season, the Yankees are so far ahead of
their competition that the only thing left for print and electronic
journalists to do is to poke, to prod, to pontificate of perils
that await.
</P>
<P>
   There are just enough cautionary tales out there to convince
just about anybody that even if the sky doesn't fall today, the
bogeyman will come out from under the bed tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees entered Tuesday night's game against Cleveland on a
pace to go 122-40. Two teams this century have won more than 110
games in a season. The 1906 Chicago Cubs went 116-36 and lost the
World Series to the cross-town rival White Sox in six games. The
1954 Cleveland Indians went 111-43 and got swept by the New York
Giants in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Those were simple, uncomplicated days when the winners of the
American and National League pennant races proceeded directly to
the World Series. Now even the best-pedigreed teams must navigate
though two rounds of playoff minefields before they get to the
World Series. It's enough to drive sweaty-palmed fans to make
frantic speed-dial calls to talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen to the Yankees' legacy if they don't win the
last game they play in October? What if the Yankees run into the
Cleveland Indians again in the playoffs? What if the Indians manage
to swing a deal that adds Randy Johnson to a pitching staff that
already includes Bartolo Colon and Yankee-killer Jaret Wright? What
if an asteroid crashes into the Bronx, wiping out the Yankees
starting rotation?
</P>
<P>
   Step back a moment. Take a deep breath. There will be plenty of
time for the Yankees and their fans to worry about October.
</P>
<P>
   What we have for the rest of July, through August, September and
October, is the best of all baseball worlds. Yankees fans can
follow their team's relentless, one-day-at-a-time pursuit of
excellence. Yankees haters can cling to the hope that pinstripes
will turn into straitjackets when the postseason arrives.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to experience a baseball season is to treat it as a
journey, not a destination. Seasons are too long and take teams on
too many detours for the final stop to be the end-all.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Red Sox fans who wallow in the supposed ``Curse of the
Bambino'' have lost their bearings. Even without having won a World
Series since 1918, the Red Sox have one of the richest traditions
in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams hitting .406 in 1941. The pennant races of 1949 and
1950. The seven-game World Series with the St. Louis Cardinals in
1946. The ``Impossible Dream'' season of 1967, culminating in
another seven-game Word Series. Another seven-game World Series in
1975. Another seven-game World Series in 1986. Wade Boggs in his
line-driving prime. Roger Clemens in his power-pitching prime.
Would Red Sox fans really give up all that to trade places with the
Florida Marlins?
</P>
<P>
   October will come when it is good and ready. What the Yankees
have now is special, no matter what happens later. All things
considered, the Yankees are the best team _ in every sense of the
word _ you're likely to have the privilege of seeing in your
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the chill that would have run through Yankees fans if
they had known before the season that center fielder Bernie
Williams already would have missed 28 games to injury.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if they'd have known that two other Yankees
cornerstones, shortstop Derek Jeter and closer Mariano Rivera,
would have done time on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if they'd have known Chuck Knoblauch would struggle to
hit .260 while conjuring scatter-armed images of Steve Sax at
second base. Imagine the horror of Andy Pettitte, David Cone and
David Wells having higher earned run averages than Hidecki Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine first baseman Tino Martinez needing a month to come out
of a funk after a beaning by Armando Benitez. Imagine injuries
limiting designated hitter Chili Davis to four at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the lefty-righty setup tandem of Mike Stanton and Jeff
Nelson combining for a 4.94 ERA in its first 74 fr 2/3 innings of
work.
</P>
<P>
   With all that, and without a single player who is likely to
crack the top five in the most valuable player voting, the Yankees
have been more efficient than the Murderer's Row team of 1927 and
the Mickey Mantle/Roger Maris powerhouse of 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's too good to last through a divisional series,
through a league championship series, through a World Series, is
anybody's guess. A baseball team proves its merit over a marathon
schedule. The playoffs are a series of sprints.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about any of that now. Be happy for the chance to
see if the Yankees are too good not to be true.

   FILM-BUFFALO (Undated) ``Buffalo 66'' is an odd film full of
surprises, some good, some not so believeable.It's sadly funny as
well as whimsical in spite of its backdrop of potentially abrasive
_ and highly abusive _ situations. It's a strange mix of gritty
realism and fantasy stirred together into an unusual love story
that thankfully only flirts, and then flees, from violence. It's
about missed opportunity, shattered dreams and trying to make a
mark in a world that barely knows you're alive.

   FILM-LAWN (Undated) _ Australia's John Duigan continually shows
himself to be a director capable of great highs and great lows.
Unfortunately, his latest effort, ``Lawn Dogs,'' is very much at
the low end of his career chart _ indeed, is likely to be regarded
as its all-time nadir. The film is the movies' umpteenth attack on
the shallowness of suburbia, as seen through the eyes of a
10-year-old girl who has what may be the most cardboardishly venal
and hypocritical parents ever be portrayed in a major motion
picture.

   TEHRAN, Iran _ Cupid might not have to sneak around Iran
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   This country's restless youth say they have noticed a relaxation
of the strict rules prohibiting unmarried women and men from being
together in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I watch my limits, it is my right,'' said 15-year-old
Pooneh, who did not want to use her last name.
</P>
<P>
   In February, she and a male friend were detained by the
``Beseej,'' the non-uniformed auxiliary police who cruise the city
streets in vans looking for trangressors of Islam's modesty code.
</P>
<P>
   Pooneh was lucky to be released after signing a statement that,
``I undertake not to be out with a boy -- whether a relative,
friend or boyfriend -- alone, or else my parents will be
informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she reads in newspapers that walking in public will be
allowed as long as there is no hand-holding. Most believe the new
moderate president, Mohammed Khatami, has ushered in the change.
</P>
<P>
   Pooneh believes there has been a lighter touch since a girl
hanged herself while being detained. She was reportedly afraid her
parents were being told she was with a boy.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic Republic's strict, morality-based laws have made
public courtship a risky endeavor over the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Married couples have had to be ready to prove they are married.
Youth were fined or detained in police stations. Parents were
called. Boys even complained of being beaten when detained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always walking under a threat of being stopped,'' said
Vahid, 22, who was sitting recently in one of Tehran's many lush,
crowded parks with his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Her sister was detained for a night and fined after being caught
driving outside Tehran with a boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can go outside Tehran with a girlfriend,'' Vahid said.
</P>
<P>
   Banned from leaving town together, groups of girls and boys
drive in separate cars to rendezvous at parks, swimming spots and
ski lodges outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Dark movie theaters provide cover for couples. They can slip
into each other's homes when parents are away.
</P>
<P>
   Fully more than half of Iran's 60 million people are under 20
years of age, and they expect more freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's promises of a ``civil society'' helped him win an
election landslide with heavy backing from these same young
Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives may still control the police and courts, but
Khatami appeared recently to be admonishing the Beseej-type
intimidation -- or at least trying to keep young Iranians on his
side.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the rhetoric in this country, it was all couched in
the name of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``For attracting the youth to Islam, they should be approached
with forgiveness and kindness,'' he said. ``Society cannot be
advanced with narrow-mindedness and creation of terror.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Iranians are keenly sensitive to the vagaries of Iranian
politics, where a cleric's speech can alter what couples face on
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easier now,'' said Alex Petrosian, 28. ``But, if (a
religious leader) says something about it at Friday prayers, it's
terrible for the next couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   More parks and malls are free of the Beseej. Usually recruited
from Iran's poor neighborhoods, they can be spotted by their loose,
untucked shirts -- a nod to modesty standards against showing a
waistline.
</P>
<P>
   Iran remains a genuinely conservative society. Many parents
expect their children to come to them first when they seek to pair
up with someone.
</P>
<P>
   Razad Sadegi, a 25-year-old telecommunications engineer, said he
does not accept casual words like ``boyfriend and girlfriend.'' He
met his wife only a few times before they decided to get engaged.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``It's not good to try to put pressure and limits
on young people . . . Even if we put obstacles in front of them,
they will find their own way.''

AUTHOR USES GOLF TO TEACH SONS LESSONS ON LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GOTTLIEB  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALTA, N.Y. _ In college, Andrew Shanley gave up golf along with
all the other establishment things people of his generation
shunned. Golf definitely wasn't cool for him. It was elitist,
frivolous and worst of all, his dad did it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he believes that the game delivers harmony to busy lives,
a broad canvas for the art of play and, most importantly, a place
to gently connect with his sons.
</P>
<P>
   At 46, Shanley lives in Malta with the two teenage sons he
writes about in ``Fathers, Sons &AMP; Golf: Lessons in Honor and
Integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had reconfigured the love between a dad and his little
boys, an intoxicating but fleeting affair, into the love between
fathers and sons, which can be so powerful and long-lasting,'' he
writes in the concluding pages.
</P>
<P>
   The first-time author writes about how he used the links to both
strengthen his relationship with Colin, then 13 and McLean, then
10, and marvels at how completely his own dad's simple wisdom has
sunk in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to become close to my sons. I was coming to
understand my father a lot more and share with him, when all those
years he and I didn't see eye to eye on a lot of things,'' said
Shanley, who also has a two-year-old daughter, Caitlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fathers, Sons and Golf,'' (Hyperion, 222 pages) which came out
at Christmas, follows the progress of Shanley three summers ago,
when he offered his sons tips on golf and life that unfolded
largely at the Saratoga Spa State Park.
</P>
<P>
   Once a week or more the three trudged along the course,
ostensibly so father could teach his sons chips and drives. But
Shanley not only had an agenda but also made up an outline of
life's lessons he wanted to discuss: ideas about hard work, fair
play and all the other things he had thrown out as bunk when he was
young.
</P>
<P>
   Shanley, who had failed thus far in two attempts to be
published, also wanted to see if there was a book in it. ``They
didn't know I was doing it but eventually, they started to joke
about dad's lectures,'' he said of his teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkling his prose with historic references to golf and wisdom
from its most renowned players, Shanley described how he tries to
bring McLean and Colin carefully through the course. He doesn't
want them to enjoy themselves so much that they fail to take the
game seriously, yet fears if it becomes too onerous they will quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as I worried about forfeiting my children's love, I was
especially reluctant to impose discipline on them,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In the book his love is mixed with sadness about the things he
won't be able to spare his children, about the lessons they will
insist on learning on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Shanley himself shunned the game when in college during the
1960s, a time he contends that the younger generation was yelling
about community and love and really meaning they wanted to do
whatever they felt like.
</P>
<P>
   All these years later he has quit newspaper work to join the
world of advertising, an occupation he once believed was made up of
bad guys trying to sell people things they don't need. He is
propreitor of Rueckert Shanley, an advertising agency in Colonie,
just outside Albany. Shanley, who represents many medical concerns,
finds the work rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   And he plays the links, fastidiously, lovingly. His own father,
Joseph, was an ad executive who quit newspaper work to rear his
family. His lessons about simple goodness stream back year by year.
``My father and I get together to golf at least once or twice a
summer,'' said Shanley, ``and I think it means more each year.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   These are the groups making waves across the country with swing
music, helping it wash up everywhere from the Billboard charts to
MTV. Besides three- and four-word names, they all have hectic tour
schedules in common.
</P>
<P>
   SQUIRREL NUT ZIPPERS _ The surprise hit of last year and the
ones who landed swing music in MTV's Buzz Bin with their hit
``Hell,'' these seven North Carolinians play a quirky, Tin Pan
Alley sort of swing that echoes Cab Calloway more than Glenn
Miller. They return to Austin to play the Backyard on Aug. 13, a
week after their new album, ``Perennial Favorites,'' hits stores.
</P>
<P>
   ROYAL CROWN REVUE _ This lively seven-piece is the hottest of
the L.A. swing scene. Based on a classic, bluesy jump sound and
Louis Armstrong-like gruffness, RCR has a new album coming out Aug.
24 to follow up their hit Warner Bros. debut, ``Mugzy's Move.''
</P>
<P>
   CHERRY POPPIN' DADDIES _ The band most responsible for bridging
the gap between swing and ska music, this large Oregonian swing
band relies heavily on horns, sped-up rhythms and pure machismo
(hence the name). Young fans love them, which is why their
independently-release ``Zoot Suit Riot'' album has passed the
500,000 sales mark.
</P>
<P>
   BIG BAD VOODOO DADDY _ ``As seen in the movie `Swingers.'''
That's all that was needed to earn this L.A. outfit a major-label
deal and large following. Its song ``You and Me and the Bottle
Makes Three Tonight'' is right up there with Squirrel Nut Zippers'
``Hell'' as a '90s swing classic, and it exemplifies BBVD's boozy,
loose, hepcat style.
</P>
<P>

   SWINGDANCING PACKAGE FROM THE AUSTIN AMERICAN-STATESMAN
</P>
<P>
   MOVING IN THE E-ENTERTAINMENT CATEGORY
</P>
<P>
   SWING-INTRO _ Swing is in the air, and this is one retro
movement that has captured the full attention of the modern
marketing machine. (Corcoran, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   SWING-PRIMER _ Swing is what happened when the best jazz
musicians in the world were hired to play dance music for the
masses. Like gold medal skaters doing a figure 8, the idea was to
find a way to flourish within the routine. Sophistication ruled the
bandstand, leading to an overall quality of performance that makes
choosing the best recorded music from the era such a hard task. But
if you're new to the scene and want to do some catching up, you
could do a lot worse than this starter kit: (list of music
follows). (Corcoran, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   SWING-GUY _ I'm strictly freestyle, you know? I go to a club,
step up to the floor and get my groove on. I'm a free spirit, a
nonconformist to prescribed steps. In other words I ... don't know
how to dance. But recently, the indie hit ``Swingers'' made swing
dance lessons safe for young men like myself. On a Monday night, I
went over to the Caucus Club (Austin, Texas), where upwards of 50
students are packed elbow to elbow on the dance floor. (Hibberd,
Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

<P>
   BANDS-&AMP;-STYLES _ We called them lounge bands just a year and a
half ago, but no matter. If you want to get into the swing of
things, these are the groups to go out and see for that full
hipster experience. These are the groups making waves across the
country with swing music, helping it wash up everywhere from the
Billboard charts to MTV. Besides three- and four-word names, they
all have hectic tour schedules in common. (Riemenschneider, Austin

 &HT;    Dancing in the dark
 &HT;    By James Hibberd
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm strictly freestyle, you know? I go to a club, step up to the
floor and get my groove on. I'm a free spirit, a nonconformist to
prescribed steps.
</P>
<P>
   In other words I ... don't know how to dance.
</P>
<P>
   There, I said it. I can successfully move to music, but I can't
dance with any consistent form or watchable style.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only time I ever learned a bona fide dance step was
when I first saw Bruce Springsteen get down with Courteney Cox in
the video for ``Dancing in the Dark.'' Remember that one? The Boss
pulled thrilled young Courteney up from the front row and they
busted into that halting, jogging-in-place boogie.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1984, when ``Dancing in the Dark'' made rock music
dancing safe for people without rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years later, the indie hit ``Swingers'' made swing dance
lessons safe for young men like myself _ guys who normally wouldn't
be caught dead in a boxstep but are now changing their clothes,
their hair, their face to be as smooth as Frank and Dino. Or at
least as cool as Vince Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Before jumping on the trend bandwagon (which is now admittedly
halfway to Lubbock), I wanted to observe a swing dance class in
progress so I'd know what I was getting into.
</P>
<P>
   On a Monday night, I went over to the Caucus Club, where upwards
of 50 students are packed elbow to elbow on the dance floor.
Several of the guys are actually quite good and I wonder why
they're in the novice class, switching partners with girl after
girl, taking their hands and offering suggestions ... oh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's flirty, it's fun and it's been growing tremendously,''
says instructor Darby O'Shieles. ``I love doing it. I get to hang
out in a bar and dance as my job.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Shieles estimates about 70 percent of students arrive without
a partner. They switch off every few minutes in what seems like the
world's quickest dates: ``Hi, I'm Joe. First time here? Now we hold
hands and dance. Whoops, sorry about your toe. Next!''
</P>
<P>
   After watching the class, I decide to take my first-ever lesson
at the lounge uberclub Speakeasy. I figure a dim, windowless club
will provide more cover.
</P>
<P>
   The next night, I sign up for class and by 8 p.m. there are
about 90 post-Greek twentysomethings milling around Speakeasy,
preparing for their lesson by nervously slamming Shiner Bocks and
vodka tonics.
</P>
<P>
   Dianna Sanford, our capable instructor, smiles like a chorus
line dancer and begins class by separating boys from girls onto
opposite sides of the dance floor. It's tough not to think of your
junior high dances, and I guess that's appropriate since we're all
beginners again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we're going to teach you what to do with your feet,''
Sanford says, then shows us: slow, slow, quick-quick, slow ...
slow, slow, quick-quick, slow ...
</P>
<P>
   I'm lost already. I want to explain to Sanford that my feet are
wild and undisciplined and only a swing dancing dominatrix could
ever tame them. I apologize to Lisa, my partner. We've only been
``dancing'' for a couple of minutes, and I've stomped several toes.
Not just my her toes, other people's toes. When Sanford orders us
to switch partners, I grab onto Lisa's arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey doll,'' I say, panicked yet savoring the opportunity to
use sexist swinger lingo in-context. ``Don't go away, you're the
only baby I ever want to dance with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, can it,'' she says. ``You just don't want everybody to
know how bad you are.''
</P>
<P>
   She's right, of course. But looking around, I notice other guys
sweating and awkwardly straining to pick up the moves. I look down
at my feet, wondering what they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold on,'' interrupts Sanford, and the instructor points in my
general direction.
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh. She must have spotted me trying to pass off slam dancing
as swing dancing. She's going to chastise me for sloppy technique,
blame me for throwing off the whole group.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she's pointing at a nearby young man who's standing
alone and blushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this the only person that doesn't have a partner?'' Sanford
asks.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety people turn to look at the poor sap without a girl to
dance with; the loser of this grown-up version of musical chairs.
He blushes harder. Sanford somehow finds a match for him, and we're
off again: slow, slow, quick-quick, slow ...
</P>
<P>
   About an hour later _ a long hour later _ something happens. The
bouncy swing music is playing (... slow, slow, quick-quick, slow
... ) and my mental chant quickens (... slow-slow-quickquick-slow
... ) and then, like a huge, clunky DC-10 hurling down a runway, I
lift off ... I'm swing dancing. I feel like Steve Martin in ``The
Jerk'' when he discovers beat and rhythm. I can't believe it. I'm
dancing in the dark at Speakeasy, a successful wannabe of other
hipster wannabes. Suddenly, none of the trendiness of swinger
culture matters.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, bandwagon ... wait up.

 &HT;    It don't mean a thing...
 &HT;    By Michael Corcoran
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Alternative radio stations and MTV are playing swing
music in the form of ``Zoot Suit Riot'' by the Cherry Poppin'
Daddies and ``Hell'' by Squirrel Nut Zippers. The TV shows a Gap
commercial where khaki-clad couples do amazing dance stunts while
Louis Prima sings ``Jump Jive an' Wail.'' At the movies, there's
``Swingers,'' the 1996 film that romanticized the martini life and
had Big Bad Voodoo Daddy as the house band. Meanwhile, such Austin
clubs as the Caucus, the Ritz, Speakeasy, Sullivan's Ringside and
Top of the Marc have increased their bookings of swing bands and
are doing good early business by hosting jam-packed swing dance
lessons. Swing is in the air, and this is one retro movement that
has captured the full attention of the modern marketing machine.
</P>
<P>
   Since it's mid-'30s to late-'40s heyday, swing has been revived
more times than ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' or at least as often
as Martin Landau's career. The appeal of swing is in the dancing,
the clothing and the pure elegance of those moonlight serenades
created by the likes of Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller and Duke
Ellington. Romantic and slinky, swing is the opposite of grunge,
and a well-oiled jitterbugging couple is about as far away from the
mosh pit as you can get. Swing is suave. It's real music by real
people who have been dead a real long time. But the music lives on
in every couple that first kissed on the dance floor. After a night
of dancing, sweat glistens like temptation's jewelry. That's why
swing keeps coming back.

 &HT;    GET IN THE SWING: The No-Risk List
 &HT;    By Michael Corcoran
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kids raised on Bush (the band, not the president) may think all
those Cherry Zippin' Squirrel Daddy bands are musical trailblazers,
but the danceable, Big-Band style of music goes all the way back to
the early 1980s when such former punk rockers as Joe Jackson
(``Jumpin' Jive'') and David Johanson (a k a Buster Poindexter)
brought snappy suits, slicked-back hair and wild couples-dancing to
the national consciousness (as it were).
</P>
<P>
   Some may call this bit of musical history ridiculous, claiming
that swing actually started with the second Lyle Lovett album or
the unlikely MTV hit ``Stray Cat Strut'' in 1982. Also, let's not
forget hometown heroes Asleep at the Wheel or their cosmic cousin
Commander Cody, whose brand of swing must've seemed like a
hallucination to so many stoned-out '60s hippies.
</P>
<P>
   Enough kidding, here's the real history: In terms of musical
innovation, swing began in 1924 when Louis Armstrong, a brilliantly
soulful and expressive trumpet player from New Orleans, joined the
Fletcher Henderson band. Holding court at Roseland Ballroom,
Henderson and his orchestra specialized in music that was easy to
dance to, with a lot of stiff riffs the white crowd could hold on
to. What Armstrong brought to the sound was a confident soloing
style that flew all around the beat. He got the band to play looser
by stretching out the sound possibilities. Armstrong lasted only 14
months in Henderson's band before moving on to his own thing, but
along with Duke Ellington, who gave the musical style its name with
``It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),'' he
pioneered a new style of danceable jazz.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1935, however, when a clarinet player from
Chicago named Benny Goodman broke onto the scene, that swing became
a national craze. Fronting a racially mixed band that included
Count Basie, Teddy Wilson, Lester Young, Gene Krupa and, later,
young Texas-born Charlie Christian (the progenitor of electric jazz
guitar), Goodman sacrificed none of his virtuosity yet still made
music simple enough to dance to by cherishing the melody. Swing is
what happened when the best jazz musicians in the world were hired
to play dance music for the masses. Like gold medal skaters doing a
figure 8, the idea was to find a way to flourish within the
routine. In a way, swing was a precursor to rock 'n' roll because
it showed that simplicity and repetition are the ways to physically
move the crowd. In their ability to do so, Goodman and Glenn
Miller, a couple of bespectacled Midwesterners, became major pop
stars.
</P>
<P>
   Sophistication ruled the bandstand, leading to an overall
quality of performance that makes choosing the best recorded music
from the era such a hard task. But if you're new to the scene and
want to do some catching up, you could do a lot worse than this
starter kit:
</P>
<P>
   THE ESSENTIALS
</P>
<P>
   ``Laughin' Louis,'' Louis Armstrong and His Orchestra
(RCA/Bluebird, 1992 reissue). Containing material from 1932-33 and
featuring such players as saxman Louis Jordan, drummer Chick Webb
and pianist Teddy Wilson, this collection gives a blueprint for the
swing craze that would follow in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Live At Carnegie Hall,'' Benny Goodman (Recorded in 1938,
first released by Columbia in 1950). This is the vortex of swing,
with Goodman's serpentine clarinet notes winding soulfully around a
band that included drummer Gene Krupa, vibe player Lionel Hampton,
the great Count Basie on piano and such other legends as Harry
James, Lester Young, Teddy Wilson and Ziggy Elman. If you can
afford only one album from this era, go for this double disc.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Essential Glenn Miller'' (RCA). Less a virtuoso than
Goodman and an unimaginative band leader compared to Duke
Ellington, Miller attracted bigger crowds than both of those
geniuses by tapping into the romance of swing and creating music
that kept audiences giddy and dancing for hours. ``String of
Pearls,'' ``Moonlight Serenade'' and ``In the Mood'' are the
magical standards of the time. The term ``a class act'' has been
rendered almost without value by overuse, but Miller and his
Orchestra fit the bill like none other.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``16 Most Requested Songs,'' Duke Ellington (Columbia). This
1994 release cuts right to the charts, ignoring the ambitious
suites that are such a part of Sir Duke's legacy. But all the
Harlem classics are here, from ``Don't Get Around Much Anymore''
and ``Caravan'' to ``Mood Indigo'' and ``Sophisticated Lady.'' This
is kind of a cheapo repackaging deal, but in terms of music
included, you can't get more for $12.99.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Best of Louis Jordan'' (MCA). Newer ``swing'' bands
such as Cherry Poppin' Daddies and Royal Crown Revue are
practically tribute groups to this hepcat from Arkansas, who paid
his dues playing with Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald, then
broke out on the mid-'40s with a host of jumpin' sides such as
``Five Guys Named Moe,'' ``Caldonia,'' ``What's the Use of Getting
Sober'' and ``Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chickens.'' Purists may say
Jordan and his predecessors Cab Calloway and Jimmy Lunceford were
closer in style to jump and boogie music than to swing, but nobody
really swang quite like this.
</P>
<P>
   MORE RECOMMENDED DISCS
</P>
<P>
   ``Vol. 3'' (1938), Django Reinhardt (JSP). Austin's 8 1/2
Souvenirs are unashamedly modeled after some of the swing music
this gypsy jazz guitarist made with The Quintet of the Hot Club of
France and violinist Stephane Grappelli, and this collection by a
tiny British label contains some of the best of those tracks,
including ``Swing From Paris'' and ``Swing '39.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Ella and Her Fellas'' (1938), Ella Fitzgerald (Decca).
Containing four tracks with Louis Armstrong, plus such other guests
as the Mills Brothers, Chick Webb and Louis Jordan, this LP boasts
swaggering versions of ``A-Tisket A-Tasket,'' ``Paper Moon'' and
``Sentimental Journey.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Drop Me Off -- n Harlem'' (1942), Charlie Barnet and His
Orchestra (Decca). Featuring the marvelous Kay Starr on vocals and
some fine trumpet from Roy Eldridge and guitar playing by Barney
Kessel, this recording didn't break any new ground, but it's one of
the most danceable slices of hard swing around. If Goodman were the
Rolling Stones, Barnet would be AC/DC.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Yes, Indeed,'' Tommy Dorsey (Bluebird). This compilation of
sides from 1939-42 showcases not only Dorsey's rich trombone tone
but also the spectacular drumming of Buddy Rich and the writing and
arranging talents of Sy Oliver. Plus, Duke Ellington guests on the
last track, ``Minor Goes Muggin'.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Come Dance With Me,'' Frank Sinatra (Capitol). You gotta
have some Frank, and several titles would do the trick, including
``It Might As Well Be Swing,'' which he recorded with the Count
Basie Orchestra, or ``Sinatra's Swingin' Session,'' but this one is
chosen for its lack of ballads and full-on commitment to dance.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Capitol Collector's Series,'' Ella Mae Morse (Capitol 1994
reissue). Besides bringing Nat King Cole to Capitol, this sassy
Texan also had the first hit for the fledgling label with ``Cow Cow
Boogie.'' A relatively unsung hero of swing, perhaps because she
was a white woman who sounded black, Morse recorded many wonderful
tracks, including the original version of ``House of Blue Lights''
and an unsurpassed take of ``Come On Board, Little Chillun.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Jumpin' With Joe: The Complete Aladdin and Imperial
Recordings,'' Big Joe Turner (EMI). Hey, you novice jitterbuggers:
If you can keep up to these hot nuggets of Kansas City swing,
you'll earn your dancing shoes.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Best of the Big Bands,'' Hal Kemp (Columbia). Two reasons
you haven't heard of him: 1) He came from North Carolina, and 2) He
died in 1940. But this collection, great for practicing at home,
proves the reedman had one of the smoothest yet most danceable
bands around.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Free For All'' (1937), Artie Shaw. His distaste for the
music business was almost as legendary as his music, but this 1988
reissue shows him to be a sophisticated and adventurous soul, who
dissipated ``the suits'' with his elegant clarinet. Buddy Rich and
Roy Eldridge are the key sidemen here.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Capitol Collector's Series,'' Louis Prima (Capitol). A
dancer's fave who kept the music hot, hot, hot.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``1934-1937,'' Fletcher Henderson (Classics). The pupil
taught the teacher, when Louis Armstrong joined Henderson's band in
1924 and showed them how to swing it, but credit Henderson for
letting the music show him the way. Here, the pianist/arranger's
got another great band, including Ben Webster, Benny Carter and Chu
Berry, who do that swing thing while on the cusp of bebop.
</P>
<P>
   MORE SWING FOR YOUR BUCK
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Bands in Hi-Fi'' (Capitol). This double disc starts off
with ``Let's Dance'' from Goodman and ``Satin Doll'' by Ellington,
but doesn't let up as it gives the best of such greats as Count
Basie, Harry James, Artie Shaw, Stan Kenton and Kay Kyser. Glenn
Miller is one of the few greats missing, but he's represented by
covers of his greatest material by Glen Gray.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Kings of Swing: Best of the Big Bands'' (Laserlight), A
budget-priced collection that hits on all the key points _ Glenn
Miller, Count Basie, Benny Goodman, Woody Herman, Harry James, Duke
Ellington and Tommy Dorsey _ in just over an hour.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Swingin' Singles'' (Rhino). Exploring the cheesier side of
the retro sound, this compilation leads off with Della Reese doing
``The Lady Is a Tramp'' and ends 17 tracks later with Eartha Kitt;
in between are some hot numbers by the likes of Bobby Darin,
Rosemary Clooney, Sarah Vaughan, and duets with Louis Prima and
Keely Smith and Count Basie and Tony Bennett.

JOURNALISTIC OBSESSION: GETTING IT RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Thanks to a few highly publicized scandals of
late, the American public is getting comfy with the idea that most
journalists are either habitual fabricators or complete
professional slobs.
</P>
<P>
   Because a couple of writers have been caught making people and
information out of whole cloth (the Boston Globe's Patricia Smith,
the New Republic's Stephen Glass) or because a CNN producer ignored
major contradictory facts in a now-discredited story about U.S.
defectors and nerve gas during the Vietnam war, journalists in
general are supposed to be lazy and untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   It's sort of like using a handful of malpractice cases to
condemn the American medical profession.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I see plenty that is wrong with the news
media. Usually, I am among the first (and regular) persons to
holler about many of our practices and habits. But, after 27 years
in this business, I think I know when it's fair to holler and when
it ain't.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't nearly as titillating an image as that of a conniving
reporter, gleefully making up facts and inventing people, but I'll
bet my paycheck that some variation on the following is much more
common in journalism than the aforementioned scenario: It's a
little before midnight, and a veteran reporter is pulled by fear
from deep sleep into crypt-cold consciousness. As if it were a
sharp rock in her sheets, a paragraph, two-thirds of the way down
in a story she has written, suddenly dominates her senses.
</P>
<P>
   Just one paragraph. In a story of 50 paragraphs. The part where
she mentions the research findings of (say) a Vanderbilt professor.
</P>
<P>
   She got his name right, yes? It was Robert, not Raymond? Then
again ... oh, God. What if it wasn't the Vanderbilt guy at all who
did that research? Maybe it was the guy from Rutgers.
Raymond-something. She interviewed both of them so long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Robert? Raymond?
</P>
<P>
   The reporter is wide awake.
</P>
<P>
   She's worked this story for weeks. She's interviewed dozens of
people, read scores of magazine and newspaper articles, a couple of
inch-thick studies and a half-dozen academic analyses _ all of
which she highlighted with yellow marking pen.
</P>
<P>
   She filled three shorthand notebooks and produced four drafts of
the story as it made its way through several editors and two
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that the reporter went over and over her
material _ despite the fact that she has been doing this same kind
of work for a generation _ she knows only one thing will allow her
to calm down and go back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   If she's lucky, she has all of her notebooks and highlighted
reading at home. If she's unlucky (or forgot about this
phenomenon), she gets dressed and drives to her office. When she
finds the right notebook, she scans the pages.
</P>
<P>
   Bingo. Vanderbilt. Robert. She had it right all the time.
</P>
<P>
   While I do not personally know a single journalist who makes up
people and quotes, I know plenty who have experienced a little
drama like the one I just described. And they've experienced it
more than once.
</P>
<P>
   Despite our individual faults and weaknesses _ and those of our
very diverse industry _ the preponderance of news women and men
that I have known over three decades retain a remarkable commitment
to ``getting it right.'' Information that satisfies most people
prompts the majority of journalists to ask more questions and head
for the library.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the limits of a daily deadline, every fact cannot be
double-checked nor every quote verified. And, yes, the pressure of
today's competition has worsened those limits, allowing little room
for quality control.
</P>
<P>
   Most days though, most of us still get most of it right.
</P>
<P>
   When we don't, no matter how long we have been in the business,
nobody hates the mistake more than we do.

which rejected thalidomide in 1960. Now, four decades later,

the genome of the Syphilis bacterium. It's a bacterium that has a

genome they will find a way to grow it. This is the golden age of

A `CIVILIZED SOCIETY' REQUIRES THE GUILLOTINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CARLOS TAHMAZIAN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PACIFICA, Calif. _ After a scrumptious meal of crab legs with
melted butter, Mandarin-style pork spare ribs, spinach salad, pork
fried rice, a chocolate sundae and a Diet Coke, Thomas M. Thompson
was executed by injection early Tuesday at San Quentin Prison.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1976, when the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death
penalty, there have been more than 200 executions nationwide.
That's approximately 10 per year, a handful in proportion to the
number of murders.
</P>
<P>
   Every execution brings up the question whether civilized people
should officially put other people to death. In my opinion, the
death penalty doesn't belong in a civilized society. The question,
therefore, is whether our society is civilized.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, you can find child murderers, serial
killers, mass murderers, drive-by shooters, professional assassins,
snipers, gang wars and drug-related deaths. In a nation that
embodies a ``free-for-all society,'' rather than a free society for
all, we can enumerate animal sacrifices in the name of freedom of
religion, cannibalism, incest, torching of people, putting female
immigrants into sexual slavery, child molesters, thousands of
street gangs, youngsters killing other youngsters for basketball
shoes, cruelty to animals for sport, kidnaping girls for sex,
schoolyard shootings, a multinational contingent of organized crime
and too many politicians who indulge in every possible form of
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   As proud Americans we can also brag that any European who wants
to commit suicide can buy a ticket to Florida, stop a rental car in
the middle of Miami and ask for directions.
</P>
<P>
   Taking everything into consideration, especially the sad fact
that America provides the opportunity for individuals to amass
billions of dollars, but makes no provisions for the mentally ill
who are left on their own, the answer of course is, no.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, executions are in good standing.
</P>
<P>
   It is understood that the death penalty serves two purposes.
</P>
<P>
   One, it's retribution for taking a life or lives under ``special
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Two, it should make people who have crime in their minds think
twice and forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   After the hanging of child killer Westley Allan Dodd, the
autopsy revealed that his neck was not broken and that he probably
died from a combination of neck damage and strangulation.
</P>
<P>
   Electrocution sends high voltage of electricity through the body
as many times as needed, and sometimes becomes a fireworks show.
</P>
<P>
   In the gas chamber, the guest is advised to breathe as fast as
possible and in the meantime jerks around in agony.
</P>
<P>
   In lethal injection, sometimes the person to be executed helps
in the search for a good vein.
</P>
<P>
   And in Utah, the condemned person is offered the option of
theatrical death by firing squad.
</P>
<P>
   What has to be done in the national interest is to come up with
a fast, painless, foolproof method to put people to death.
Something that would well represent America's idiosyncrasy, showing
the ``deathstyles of the rotten and infamous'' with the same
panache as the ``lifestyles of the rich and famous.''
</P>
<P>
   So why not go to Paris and bring back the guillotine?
</P>
<P>
   There is no faster, cleaner, less painful and more efficient way
to execute somebody. No flames and smoke coming out of the electric
helmet. No desperate gasping for air. No ``let's find the vein''
games. No more guessing how long the rope has to be. Zap, plop and
it's over.
</P>
<P>
   And how about the grandiose, truly American spectacle of the
guillotine itself: Looming high on a raised platform, with a tall,
bare-chested, black-hooded executioner with arms folded.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty would be carried out at 10 p.m. and televised
to coincide with the news hour. Expert camera work would show the
heavy, angled blade race down toward the condemned person's neck.
Millions of people would see the severed head fall into the wicker
basket and watch the executioner and raise it high, showing that
justice was done.
</P>
<P>
   These would be mind-sobering, soul-chilling images for everyone
to see, not much different than your everyday run-of-the-mill cable
TV movie.

which has dipped by 80 percent since 1980_ is now affordable for
the 2 billion people worldwide not connected to power lines. And
other sources of renewable energy, including wind and biomass, can
be accessed for pennies a day, according to a new Winrock

JULY 16: WHEN TRINITY CHANGED OUR WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA BASS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANVILLE, Calif. _ Century by century, July in America turns out
to be a significant month. Our most famous July event, simply known
as ``The Fourth,'' commemorates approval of the Declaration of
Independence in 1776.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those three hot July days of 87 years later _
``four score and seven years,'' as Lincoln put it so gracefully in
his Gettysburg Address.
</P>
<P>
   July 16 is also the anniversary of another historic event. It's
never celebrated, seldom acknowledged. On this day in 1945, at
05:29:45 a.m., at a secret military base in New Mexico _ not much
different from those bases in India and Pakistan where a new arms
race has begun _ the United States successfully tested the world's
first atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The code name for the July 16 project was ``Trinity.'' It was
the final experiment of the Manhattan Project. The next time a
Trinity bomb exploded _ three days after the Manhattan Project's
untested uranium bomb had wiped out the city of Hiroshima _
Nagasaki was destroyed. World War II soon came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic result of the Trinity bomb _ a plutonium-based
fission device soon made obsolete by its far more powerful
hydrogen-fusion cousin _ was to kick start a feverish arms race
between the United States and what was then the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Klaus Fuchs and other spies, Stalin had been well
aware before Hiroshima of the existence of atomic weapons; he was
also well aware, and extremely angry, that his erstwhile allies
were building these weapons behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the Soviet Union began its own atomic research program.
Naturally, we suspected as much, so our own bomb program blossomed.
And once the Soviet Union conducted its own Trinity test in 1949,
our research on a thermonuclear (hydrogen) bomb accelerated,
resulting in our first test of this device on Sept. 1, 1952.
</P>
<P>
   A similar test by the Soviet Union showed that not only was the
race on, but that nothing would stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Arms races, of course, are not new. But the nuclear arms race
was different. It was a race which, if lost, could mean not only
losing a war but possibly ceasing to exist. For that reason, the
race has not stopped with the fall of the Berlin Wall. India and
Pakistan are only the latest (declared) entrants.
</P>
<P>
   Another Trinity spinoff is the redefinition of national
security. Because nuclear arms research reaches into so many fields
_ industry, academia, the military _ fear of espionage has spread.
We can't just round up the usual suspects. The list now includes
everyone from the weapons designer to the physics department
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   With so many people under suspicion, the inevitable outcomes are
mischief and chaos. Sometimes the right people are accused.
Sometimes the wrong people are, with ruinous results. This is a
frightful way for any nation to conduct itself, and while America
is not the only country tainted with a McCarthy Era, we are the one
country whose principles should have made us know better.
</P>
<P>
   Another byproduct of Trinity is the way it altered science. The
Manhattan Project marks the first time government, business and the
scientific community worked together on a gargantuan research
project. But not only that. The Manhattan Project involved
technology nobody knew much about. Fission was discovered only in
1939. Until 1942, no one knew if a chain reaction could be
accomplished _ or if it could be made self-sustaining (the
alternatives being that it would peter out or go critical).
</P>
<P>
   And it worked. This huge effort, based on learn-as-you-go
technology, worked. The bomb exploded _ imploded, really _ and the
soon-to-become-familiar mushroom cloud rose up and spread itself
over the desert morning.
</P>
<P>
   This was a revolutionary way to do science. It is a revolution
that has never stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Trinity meant more to science than a new way of practicing
physics, more than this menage-a-trois of government, business and
academia. On July 16, 1945, a moral dimension descended, like
fallout, onto science itself. Science was no longer neutral.
Science, and scientists, now had the power to blow up the world.
</P>
<P>
   Since Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the United States has been
vigilant regarding atomic weapons. Having been the first to drop
the Bomb, we have made every effort not to do so again.
</P>
<P>
   To quote Lincoln once more, ``It is altogether fitting and
proper that we should do this.''
</P>
<P>
   As of July 16, 1945, America has borne the burden of having
given birth to the Bomb and having ushered in 53 years of treating
with utmost respect the weapon we created.
</P>
<P>
   We should reflect this week on this new world we established,
and also ask ourselves, as the century draws to a close, whether
Trinity has made war more likely, or less.

ZORRO-MOVIE (Los Angeles) _ ``The Mask of Zorro'' heartthrob
Antonio Banderas talks about the south-of-the-border swashbuckling
film's difficult shoot, the ups and downs of his movie career and
his directorial debut with ``Crazy in Alabama,'' a satiric comedy
about the 1960s civil rights movement that stars his real-life wife
Melanie Griffith. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
ZORRO-LEGEND (Los Angeles) _ Zorro sprung from the pages of pulp
fiction to silver-screen fame in the 1920s, and this masked avenger
has been universally admired ever since. Every generation has had
its own Zorro, dating back to Douglas Fairbanks Sr. who donned the
masked and cape in the silent film that launched his own legendary
career. By Yvette Cabrera. 
. 
ZORRO-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``The Mask of Zorro'' boasts all the
classic movie virtues. Its story is, by turns, funny, exciting and
heart-touching. Every shot is lovingly composed. The players
operate at a pleasing pitch, with just enough good acting and movie
stardom to be irresistibly infectious. 3{ Stars. By Bob Strauss.

POLISH-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``Polish Wedding'' is one of those
eccentric, episodic movies that tries so hard to win your love that
it ends up grating on your nerves. By the time first-time director
Theresa Connelly finally does pique your interest, you're too far
gone to really care. 2 Stars. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
WHATEVER (Los Angeles) _ If you hated high school and couldn't wait
for your teen years to end, if you thought your parents (if you had
parents at all) didn't understand or if you just wanted Mom and Dad
to leave you alone, you might appreciate ``Whatever,'' a sad,
touching look at a young girl facing the daunting task of becoming
an adult. 3 Stars. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
POP-BEAT (Los Angeles) _ If you caught Lucinda Williams on
late-night TV recently, that was country singer-songwriter Jim
Lauderdale on acoustic guitar and harmony vocals. ``I just love
singing harmonies with her,'' said Lauderdale, whose own album
titled ``Whisper'' was released earlier this year. ``We have a real
natural blend. And I'm a huge fan of her writing.'' By Fred
Shuster. 
. 
DISCS-MUSIC _ In an effort to put the kibosh on the flood of
unauthorized concert recordings, Counting Crows issued ``Across a
Wire: Live in New York,'' a specially priced double-disc ``bootleg
buster,'' consisting of an unplugged VH1 side and an electric MTV

THE SMILE BEHIND `THE MASK'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The desert temperatures were brutal. The altitude
was nosebleed territory. The swords were real ... and sharp.
</P>
<P>
   There was really only one way for Antonio Banderas to get
through filming ``The Mask of Zorro.'' The way he's gotten through
most of his life: laugh a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider a sense of humor, being ironic, synonymous with
being intelligent,'' says the 37-year-old Spanish actor, who's made
an international career out of slyly joshing the good looks and
radiant charm that could have typecast him as a latter-day Latin
lover. ``That's my position in life, in general terms. I like the
irony of life _ or, at least, I use that approach when confronted
with things I don't like or understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why I work best with directors who include that wink
in their work, who know that it is always OK to laugh. And of
course, I feel that if you are going to laugh about other stuff,
the first thing you have to be able to laugh about is yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of joshing amidst the swashbuckling in ``Mask of
Zorro,'' which was directed by Martin Campbell (``GoldenEye'') and
executive produced by Steven Spielberg, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Banderas plays Alejandro Murrieta, a less-than-successful bandit
in old Mexican California. He is recruited by the original Zorro
(Anthony Hopkins) to take up the famous black mask and cape against
evil Spanish aristocrat Don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson).
</P>
<P>
   Much of the film's comedy springs from Hopkins' noble Don Diego
De La Vega's efforts to teach hotheaded Murrieta both the finer
points of fencing and how to behave like a true Spanish gentleman.
With an out-of-control guy like Murrieta, an extended
trial-and-error period ensues.
</P>
<P>
   Not that ``Mask of Zorro'' is a comedy on the order of George
Hamilton's ``Zorro the Gay Blade.'' But like the Hollywood feature
films it most resembles, the silent 1920 and sound 1940 ``The Mark
of Zorro,'' ``Mask'' is an adventure romp that knows precisely when
to kid itself and when to get down to action-packed business.
</P>
<P>
   Which with this movie, more often than not, meant working to
within inches of one's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very physically tough project,'' Banderas explains.
``Six-and-a-half months in Mexico _ and I love Mexico _ but it was
so hot. We were working in the Sonora Desert in 118 degrees, and I
was wearing suede pants, two shirts and a felt jacket! And they
were catching three or four rattlesnakes a day around the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, when we moved to Mexico City, we were working at 2,600
meters altitude, so we were out of breath all the time and had to
get oxygen out of bottles. You can control all of that after all
those months if you're doing a movie in which you don't have to
take any kind of risks. But after working 14 hours a day, when you
have start a swordfight with somebody else _ and have to be funny
about it! _ well, we are actually very lucky that everybody came
away with all of their eyes and ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Or other precious parts. One of ``Zorro's'' signature scenes is
a fencing match between the masked avenger and Elena (Catherine
Zeta-Jones), the daughter of De La Vega who's been raised since
infancy by Montero. Stealing kisses between thrusts and parries,
the new Zorro ends the encounter with a flourish, leaving the
lovely Elena unscratched but, via a few deft strokes, practically
undressed.
</P>
<P>
   Zeta-Jones not only survived the performance, she appreciated
her partner's, um, skillful execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antonio is so charming,'' the Welsh actress says. ``The guy
deserves everything that's come his way, I think. Not only is he
really professional, he's a very nice man, very generous, and there
was never one moment when I felt the least bit intimidated by
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Banderas' charm and good humor is obviously a big part of what
makes him movie star material. But it's also gotten him over
several rough spots in his personal and professional life.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in the city of Malaga on Spain's southern Andalusian
coast, Banderas initially dreamed of becoming a professional soccer
player, but that hope was crushed by a severe foot injury. Banderas
then turned his attention to acting, which soon placed him in the
right place at the right time with the right sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   On the verge of becoming the directing superstar of
freedom-flushed, post-Franco Spain, Pedro Almodovar caught on early
to Banderas' charismatic combination of smoldering sensuality and
self-deprecating silliness. The actor became an integral part of
Almodovar's internationally acclaimed, taboo-busting features ``Law
of Desire,'' ``Matador'' and ``Tie me Up! Tie Me Down!,'' among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Americans in the art film know took notice, too (Madonna, who
later would co-star with him in ``Evita,'' famously lusted after
Banderas in her documentary ``Truth or Dare''). Though unable to
speak English, he made his Hollywood debut in ``The Mambo Kings''
in 1992, and soon was landing significant parts in such major
productions as ``Philadelphia'' and ``Interview With the Vampire.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. But then things got rough. Banderas' 1995 debut
as a Hollywood lead, in Robert Rodriguez's ultra-violent
``Desperado,'' was a tour de force, but not a hit. The films that
immediately followed _ ``Assassins,'' `Four Rooms,'' ``Miami
Rhapsody,'' ``Never Talk to Strangers'' _ had much less to
recommend them.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of this career skid, Banderas fell in love with
his ``Two Much'' co-star Melanie Griffith. Since both were married
at the time, he to Spanish actress Ana Leza and she to actor Don
Johnson, the tabloids had a field day. Dire as things might have
appeared from the outside, though, Banderas and Griffith saw each
other through with love and laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have relationships with people who have no sense of
humor,'' he asserts _ and indeed the couple, who married soon after
divorcing their previous spouses, would tack the more ridiculous
tabloid reports on the wall and make fun of them. ``Before I loved
her, even before I met her, I really admired Melanie as an actress,
when I was watching `Working Girl' or `Something Wild,' movies like
that. Being with Melanie has been a gorgeous experience.''
</P>
<P>
   And a fruitful one. Banderas and Griffith have a daughter,
Stella, almost 2, who is clearly her father's proudest achievement.
And Griffith recently headlined Banderas' directing debut, ``Crazy
in Alabama,'' a satiric comedy built around, of all subjects, the
'60s civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people may say, `This is an American story, what do you
have to do with that?' '' Banderas notes. ``But look, from the
middle of this century, young people all around the world have been
raised, to some degree, by the cultural life that comes from
America. Whether it was Hollywood movies or the man on the moon or
the assassination of JFK, it was part of our culture, too.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its humor, Banderas feels ``Crazy in Alabama'' addresses
the thing he likes most about his adopted country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, with all the civil rights problems in this country
and prejudice against blacks, Asians, Hispanics and whatever, you
guys generally live in peace between so many communities,'' he
says. ``Sure, there's poverty and lots of other problems, but
mainly, you survive with each other. That's a symbol to the whole
world, and it's so attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to ``Mask of Zorro.'' Banderas is
understandably proud to be the first Spaniard to play the
79-year-old pop hero. But even though the new movie employs many
Latinos in small parts, all of its major roles are played by
Europeans _ which has been a less-than-noble Hollywood. (On another
front, Mexican-American Rodriguez, who originated the project with
Banderas, was replaced by British director Campbell, reportedly at
Rodriguez's request over budget concerns).
</P>
<P>
   Banderas sees nothing wrong with ``Mask's'' casting, as long as
the film performs well enough to lead to wider opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be an economic reason'' for the Anglo-centric
casting, Banderas reckons. ``But `Zorro' is a great opportunity for
the studios to discover the Latino audience. It almost happened
with `La Bamba' (the 1987 hit about rock singer Ritchie Valens);
that was a sudden explosion, and a bunch of different Latino movies
came out after that. But they were very bad, and they destroyed the
goose that laid the golden egg.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Zorro' is a second opportunity to attract people back to
that. And, after all, `Zorro' is as American as Elvis Presley,
while at the same time it is Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Banderas, at least, has a bright professional future. He plays
an Arab warrior fighting alongside his Viking captors in the
upcoming Michael Crichton adventure ``The 13th Warrior.'' And if
all goes according to plan, he'll be singing his way through
another Andrew Lloyd Webber musical film next year, this time as
the lead in ``The Phantom of the Opera.''
</P>
<P>
   But, even though he smiles while saying it, Banderas obviously
has learned that survival in Hollywood is no laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been asked what it means for a Spanish guy to continue
working here,'' he notes. `` `Continue,' that's the most important
word. You can probably come here and make it for a while, but
keeping it going is the most difficult thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm trying to do.''

PULP-FICTION HERO FIGHTS THE GOOD FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ His sword may not be as flashy as the lethal
weapons of today's action heroes, but when it comes to capturing
Americans' hearts, Zorro's appeal is just as deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 80 years after emerging from the pages of a pulp fiction
magazine, Zorro has been reincarnated once again in a major motion
picture, which debuts this week, and he is expected to endear yet
another generation of admirers to the legend of the masked avenger.
</P>
<P>
   From the silent-movie era to the golden age of Hollywood to
today's age of animation, the story of the swashbuckling hero is
one that Americans and the world have come to know and love.
</P>
<P>
   The story resonates with audiences worldwide, said Luis Reyes, a
historian/archivist and author of ``Hispanics in Hollywood,'' a
film and television encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a man who upholds justice, who uphold freedoms,'' said
Reyes. ``It's the American ideals, but it's also world ideals _
someone who comes to rescue you from the most dire straits. In
Japan, he could be a samurai.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the great pantheon of heroes, Zorro seems to stand out,
said John Gertz, president of the Berkeley-based Zorro Productions,
Inc., a multifaceted entertainment production company centered on
Zorro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zorro was really the first of his genre of heroes. So many of
the other heroes were explicitly or subtly designed over him,''
said Gertz.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike today's martial-arts-kicking, nuclear bomb-blasting
heroes, Zorro is not the barbarian who chops off the villain's
head. Instead, he makes fun of the villain and has a good time,
said Gertz.
</P>
<P>
   ``He represents a sense of nobility that is often lacking in
this world,'' said Gertz. ``It's a story that goes back to the
perennial theme of justice and the uplifting of the downtrodden.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1919, the dashing Zorro debuted on the pulp fiction pages of
``The Curse of Capistrano.'' He was the creation of newspaperman
and author Johnston McCulley, who unwittingly created what was to
become an ``intergenerational cross-cultural icon,'' according to
Sandra Curtis, author of ``Zorro Unmasked: The Official History,''
released this month.
</P>
<P>
   McCulley's Zorro was a masked avenger who embodied romanticism,
righteousness and passion. He was a ``friend of the oppressed,''
who punished none except brutes who mistreated natives,'' wrote
Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   In no time, Zorro became one of the best-known characters of
popular fiction, according Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   The story is based on exploits of Don Diego de la Vega, the
seemingly lazy and spoiled son of Spanish aristocrats in
California, circa 1820. Though at first Don Diego is a defender of
the land-owning hacendados, he later comes to champion the causes
of the underprivileged peasants through his alter ego, Zorro
(Spanish for fox).
</P>
<P>
   In 1920, silent-film star Douglas Fairbanks Sr. took McCulley's
vision and made it into ``the mega-hit of its time'' with the first
Zorro major motion picture, ``The Mark of Zorro,'' according to
Curtis, who is also creative director for Zorro Productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie took what might have been a forgotten pulp fiction
story and transformed it into a huge success,'' said Curtis. ``It
completely changed Douglas Fairbanks' career and it certainly blew
the lid off of the Zorro phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   With TriStar Pictures' current release, ``The Mask of Zorro,''
starring Antonio Banderas, 15 major-film-company Zorro films have
been made in the United States, including the popular remake of the
``The Mark of Zorro'' that starred Tyrone Power.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the more than three dozen films made abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, Zorro hit the small screen in Walt Disney
Studios' ``Zorro,'' starring Guy Williams, who is still remembered
worldwide for the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``The series sparked a craze for Zorro merchandise across the
country,'' said Gertz, whose father had bought the rights to Zorro
from McCulley and then turned around and sold them to Walt Disney.
</P>
<P>
   From Zorro lunch boxes to roller skates, children had more than
100 pieces of merchandise to pick from, including Zorro chalk-tip
swords that became one of the top toys of 1957, said Gertz.
</P>
<P>
   The craze resulted in a feature article in an issue of Life
magazine that year. ``In every picture, kids were chalking Z's
everywhere,'' said Gertz. ``Talk to any baby boomer and they
probably had a chalk-tip sword and ran around the neighborhood
marking up sidewalks.''
</P>
<P>
   The craze eventually settled down, but in the 1970s television
remakes brought Zorro back to life, including the 1974 ``The Mark
of Zorro,'' starring Frank Langella and Ricardo Montalban.
</P>
<P>
   Zorro would make yet another comeback in a 1980s animated
television series, including ``The New Adventures of Zorro,'' which
debuted in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The superheroes of later generations were also influenced by
Zorro. Batman creator Bob Kane speaks openly of how Zorro inspired
his creation of Bruce Wayne, who like Zorro had a do-gooder alter
ego.
</P>
<P>
   Even cartoons have been influenced by Zorro, according to Gertz,
who was amazed at the file his office compiled of cartoons with
characters based on Zorro _ from Garfield to Broom Hilda and from
Mad magazine to the New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked at this file, it suddenly struck me that Zorro
was such a part of American culture,'' said Gertz. ``You can't grow
up in America and not know that Zorro goes zip, zip, zip.''

`MASK OF ZORRO' A CLASSIC IN ITS OWN WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3{ Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This is a test. A test to see if contemporary film
audiences, their sensibilities pummeled by crude, overamped
``event'' movies for lo, these many summers, can appreciate a
rollicking adventure that luxuriates in the last thing modern
Hollywood associates with blockbuster entertainment: fine
craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mask of Zorro'' may not be a classic film, but it boasts
all the classic movie virtues. It's story is, by turns, funny,
exciting and heart-touching (Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, two of
several credited writers, performed a similar trick for Disney's
``Aladdin''). Every shot is lovingly composed and suffused with a
burnished beauty (Phil Meheux was the cinematographer, Cecilia
Montiel the production designer). The players operate at a pleasing
pitch, with just enough good acting and movie star showing off to
be irresistably infectious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mask of Zorro'' even has a savvy, playful sense of history,
both 19th Century California's and Hollywood's. Throughout the
film, director Martin Campbell (``GoldenEye'') pays homage to the
legends of the region (one segment could have been subtitled ``Show
Me the Headof Joaquin Murieta'') and to the effective bits of both
Zorro movies past and more recent fare, from the jaunty spirit of
``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' to the brooding undercurrents of
``Batman.''
</P>
<P>
   But can all of this be appreciated in a film that moves at the
speed of one horsepower, or where fencing prowess, not the fire of
automatic weapons, is what the fighting's all about? Even though it
climaxes with an explosion so big it reportedly broke glass in
Mexican villages five miles away, ``Mask of Zorro'' is determinedly
old fashioned in its emphasis on one-to-one confrontations and
human scale action. Like its equally retro attention to quality,
though, that makes the movie exciting in a very special way.
</P>
<P>
   The perfectly cast Antonio Banderas is...well, not exactly
Zorro. The Spanish nobleman Don Diego De La Vega, who took up the
famous black cape and mask to fight colonial tyranny, is actually
played by Anthony Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   But 20 years after Mexican independence _ a period he's spent
rotting in prison _ Don Diego isn't quite his old, spry self. When
his longtime nemesis, the corrupt former governor Don Rafael
Montero (Stuart Wilson), returns to Alta California with a scheme
to wrest the territory from Mexico, Don Diego escapes.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not in shape to wreak revenge on the man who ruined his
life _ and, incidentally, kidnaped his infant daughter Elena, now
grown into an exquisitely beautiful woman (Catherine Zeta-Jones)
who thinks she's Montero's offspring. That's where Banderas'
Alejandro Murrieta comes in. An inept bandit whose own brother was
killed by Montero's henchman, the Custer-like American mercenary
Captain Harrison Love (Matt Letscher), Murrieta needs a little work
before he can take on the mutual enemy. So it's off to the
Batca &UR; .. &LR; .er, Zorro's underground headquarters, where Don Diego
trains the wild young peasant in everything it takes to effectively
make the sign of the Z.
</P>
<P>
   Banderas and Hopkins have a high time playing imperious mentor
and overeager student. Banderas has an even better time enchanting
Zeta-Jones' perpetually intrigued Elena, both as the masked man and
in a third incarnation as a fake Spanish aristocrat. They enjoy an
outrageous flamenco and an even naughtier swordslash striptease
together. But Murrieta/Zorro is so busy battling whole barracks of
bad guys, jumping off and onto speeding horses and rescuing
enslaved miners that it's a wonder he has any time left for
romance.
</P>
<P>
   It's something of a wonder, too, that Campbell and company
manage to work some truly moving bits about lost relatives and
family loyalty into the swashbuckling proceedings. (In case you
haven't guessed by now, Steven Spielberg was an executive
producer).
</P>
<P>
   But then, there's enough time to accommodate most anything the
filmmakers would want to do. If it's possible to have too much of a
good thing, ``Mask of Zorro'' is guilty; at two-and-a-quarter
hours, the film's pacing sometimes gets more leisurely than an
action-adventure's should.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't know what coy gag, what breathtaking stretch of
acrobatic swordsmanship, which texturizing social detail or
elevating moment of human interaction I wouldn't miss from a
tighter, speedier ``Mask of Zorro.'' Enough films go by too fast
these days. This one is richer than the rest, and it's a treat to
savor its indulgences.

`WHATEVER' GETS TO HEART OF TEEN TURMOIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you hated high school and couldn't wait for
your teen years to end, if you thought your parents (if you had
parents at all) didn't understand or if you just wanted Mom and Dad
to leave you alone, you might appreciate ``Whatever,'' a sad,
touching look at a young girl facing the daunting task of becoming
an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Susan Skoog makes her feature film debut with
``Whatever,'' and she certainly has a feel for the turmoil and
conflicts that characterize the lives of many teen-agers. The
film's title perfectly captures the mood of its characters _
aimless teens trying to pretend that nothing really matters when,
in truth, everything, down to the smallest detail, matters very
much.
</P>
<P>
   Young actress Liza Weil, also making her feature debut, gives an
extraordinary performance as Anna, a tough, vulnerable 17-year-old
high school senior looking for a way out of her dead-end New Jersey
neighborhood. It's 1981, the dying embers of the era of sex, drugs
and rock 'n' roll, and Anna is torn between her rebellious
instincts and her considerable talent as a painter. She dreams of
attending a prestigious art school in New York City. She'd also
like to lose her virginity, but like most kids her age, she's not
quite sure how to go about it.
</P>
<P>
   Anna certainly won't find much guidance from her divorced mother
(Kathryn Rossetter), a broken, lonely woman who has trouble paying
the bills and doesn't know what to make of her daughter's
burgeoning womanhood. Instead, Anna seeks solace with her best
friend Brenda (Chad Morgan), a wild child who has never said no to
anything or anyone. It's Brenda we see in the film's first images,
passed out and being date raped by a couple of guys in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   As you probably can tell, this isn't the feel-good movie of the
year, and ``Whatever'' often suffers from its perverse affinity for
the morose and the difficult. Certainly ``Fast Times at Ridgemont
High'' managed a more universal look at the travails of teen-age
life, through the very same perspective of a young woman (Jennifer
Jason Leigh) trying to find her way and lose her virginity.
</P>
<P>
   Both movies are set in the same year, although you sure wouldn't
be able to tell from the music. In Jersey, everyone seems to be
listening to the Ramones, Iggy Pop and Patti Smith, while in ``Fast
Times'' Southern California digs, Jackson Browne and Led Zeppelin
were the preferred choices. Again, it comes down to accessibility.
``Fast Times'' was a movie made for teens, while ``Whatever'' comes
off more as a film for wizened adults (with critically acceptable
tastes in music) wanting to remember their horrific formative
years.
</P>
<P>
   While the story line of ``Whatever,'' with its drugs, depression
and late-night dates with petty thieves, may not resonate with
everyone, it certainly paints its world with enough knowing detail
to involve its audience emotionally. Skoog captures the searing
loneliness and desperation of these young people looking to escape
and the adults who tell them ``not to expect so much _ it's easier
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Weil is terrific as Anna, who finds herself with a woman's body,
but still retaining the self-conscious awkwardness of a girl
accustomed to disappointments and rejection. It's a vivid, fully
realized performance, as is the turn by Morgan as Brenda, the
hard-living friend who courts trouble as fast as she runs from it.
Also on hand is Frederic Forrest, as Anna's high school art
teacher, Mr. Chaminsky, the one adult in this sorry town who
manages to help its young people.
</P>
<P>
   That Mr. Chaminsky is around at all serves as the movie's
acknowledgment that hope can exist, even in a place dominated by
the emptiness of keg parties where teens drug themselves into
feeling that everything is all right. A happy ending may not be
around the corner, but even in Skoog's brutally tough emotional
landscape, you grab any glimmer of optimism you can find.

`POLISH WEDDING' FALLS SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Polish Wedding'' is one of those eccentric,
episodic movies that tries so hard to win your love that it ends up
grating on your nerves. First-time director Theresa Connelly spends
a good hour flitting from character to character without ever
succeeding in involving the audience. When she finally does pique
your interest in the film's later moments, you're too far gone to
really care.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is meant to be a loving look at the Pzoniak family, a
blue-collar clan living in industrial Detroit. The Pzoniaks are
ruled by their proud mother, Jadzia (Lena Olin), an iron-willed
woman who sneaks off practically every night for trysts with a
wealthy Polish businessman (Rade Serbedzija). Her husband, Bolek
(Gabriel Byrne), is a sensitive baker who mostly looks out the
window and broods (partly explaining Jadzia's motivation for her
late-night liaisons).
</P>
<P>
   There are more family members, too many, in fact. There's the
daughter, Hala (Claire Danes), a Rapunzel-like beauty who is
keeping late-night company of her own with a local cop (Adam
Trese). There's a son named Ziggy (Daniel Lapaine) who tries hard
to overcome his name and the sudden responsibilities that have come
with a wife (Mili Avital) and newborn baby. It's a crowded house,
which makes for a crowded movie with too many subplots for its own
good.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Connelly struggles to establish the film's theme
of history repeating itself by showing the daughter making the same
mistakes as her mother. But Connelly never really lets us know her
characters, which is curious since she herself hails from a
working-class, Polish-American family. The people here are ciphers,
which certainly reduces the audience's interest level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polish Wedding'' also veers wildly in tone. Scenes meant for
laughs elicit none, while dramatic confrontations often come off as
unintentionally funny. Connelly tries to give the movie a
fairy-tale feel, but, sadly, little of that magic is captured on
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polish Wedding'' does succeed as a showcase for the sensuous
Olin, who hasn't had much success in finding good roles since the
late '80s with ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being'' and ``Enemies,
a Love Story.'' Olin is really the only one who has any luck with
the inherent contradictions in her character. It's too bad Connelly
couldn't resolve the contradictions in her script and filmmaking
approach.

COUNTING CROWS/``Across a Wire: Live in New York''
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an effort to put the kibosh on the flood of unauthorized
concert recordings, Counting Crows issued this specially priced
double-disc ``bootleg buster,'' consisting of an unplugged VH1 side
and an electric MTV side. It's not for casual fans, but the band
has made that clear. With two versions each of ``Rain King,''
``Round Here,'' ``Angels of the Silences'' and ``Have You Seen Me
Lately?'' and no new tracks (except for a hidden thingie we came
across once), ``Across a Wire: Live in New York'' (DGC) reveals
nothing new about the Crows or theirs perennially
tortured/egomaniacal frontman Adam Duritz. But like they've said,
``Across a Wire'' is ultimately a thank-you to fans while the Crows
cut the next album. Nothing wrong with that. 2{ Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
RON CARTER TRIO/``So What''
</P>
<P>
   This disc finds professorial jazz bassist Carter returning to
the minimalist piano, bass and drums format. The work of
keyboardist Kenny Barron, in particular, is worth noting on such
standouts as Cole Porter's ``You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To,''
the Miles Davis-penned title track and Carter's own ``It's About
Time.'' Rounding out the trio on ``So What'' (Blue Note) is the
elegant Lewis Nash, whose drumming dexterity fuels a high-energy
reading of Randy Weston's ``Hi-Fly.'' All aboard for a
straight-ahead blowing session (no horns allowed). 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE SUGARCUBES/``The Great Crossover Potential''
</P>
<P>
   Iceland's '80s pop-punk outfit the Sugarcubes gave us Bjork, the
lovably loony elf who once said she wanted to die being devoured by
a tiger ``or being hit by lava from a volcano.'' Well, why not?
``The Great Crossover Potential'' (Elektra) is a fine best-of
collection from this energetic early alt-rock combo. Songs such as
``Birthday,'' ``Hit'' and ``Motorcrash'' still turn up on radio and
sound fresh today, as do lesser-known numbers like ``Planet,''
``Vitamin'' and ``Deus.'' A worthy stopgap until the lava flows. 2{
Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
EAGLE-EYE CHERRY/``Desireless''
</P>
<P>
   Son of avant-garde jazz trumpeter Don Cherry and younger brother
of hip-hop chanteuse Neneh, Sweden-based Eagle-Eye offers a bluesy,
laid-back collection of largely acoustic originals. ``Desireless''
(Work) hints at the rootsy influence of Neil Young, while the
infectious ``Save Tonight'' is currently a modern-rock radio
staple. The haunting instrumental title cut was penned by Cherry's
late father. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
VARIOUS/``Cuba Now''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba Now'' (Hemisphere) offers a lively introduction to some
of Havana's hottest dance bands. During the musical revolution that
began in the late '80s, Cuban groups aimed for an exotic mixture of
modern pop and funk, jazz and regional rhythms. Here are fine
tracks from, among others, Los Van Van and NG La Banda, two of the
most popular acts in the country. A strong sampler of current hits
from the People's Paradise. 3 Stars &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
EMMYLOU HARRIS/``Spyboy''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, recorded here at the tail end of last year's European
tour, was working with a dazzlingly good roots-rhythm band of
guitarist Buddy Miller, bassist Daryl Johnson and drummer Brian
Blade. ``Spyboy'' (Eminent) includes vital takes on familiar tunes,
such as ``Ain't Livin' Long Like This'' and ``Love Hurts.'' Also on
deck is a stark reading of Daniel Lanois' never-recorded ``The
Maker.'' Due in stores Aug. 11. 3 Stars, &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
PAT MARTINO &AMP; JOYOUS LAKE/``Stone Blue''
</P>
<P>
   Creative jazz guitarist Martino took some hits for his last
album, a set of often overblown duets with the likes of Les Paul,
Michael Hedges, Cassandra Wilson and Mike Stern. ``Stone Blue''
(Blue Note), though, is a solid quintet effort in which each cast
member proves to be an empathetic and imaginative player. Martino,
who spent his formative years in an organ trio, demonstrates that
r&AMP;b attitude on such clear winners as ``Mac Tough,'' ``Two Weighs
Out'' and the dynamic title track. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SHIRLEY HORN/``I Remember Miles''
</P>
<P>
   Miles Davis loved Shirley Horn's ballad singing, and the two
worked and performed together several times before the trumpet
legend died in 1992. With ``I Remember Miles'' (Verve), she pays
tribute to Davis, singing and playing piano on nine songs long
associated with the jazz giant. Horn has done these types of albums
before, but her work here is particularly outstanding, probably
because she has been thinking about making this music for so many
years. From a haunting ``My Funny Valentine'' to a poetic rendition
of ``Blue in Green'' and the classic ``Kind of Blue,'' Horn shines
here, turning in an elegant, touching album of beautiful ballads.
3{ Stars. _ Glenn Whipp.

LOOKING FOR LAUDERDALE...

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; If you caught Lucinda Williams on late-night TV
recently, that was country singer-songwriter Jim Lauderdale on
acoustic guitar and harmony vocals.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina-born Lauderdale has known Williams for 10
years and appeared on her last two albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love singing harmonies with her,'' Lauderdale said.
``We have a real natural blend. And I'm a huge fan of her
writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauderdale's current album, ``Whisper'' (BNA), was released
earlier this year. The disc features a cameo from bluegrass legend
Ralph Stanley of the Clinch Mountain Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Lauderdale's songs have been covered by George Strait, Patty
Loveless, Vince Gill and Mark Chesnutt, among others. He appears
Tuesday at the Mint (6010 W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles; (323)
954-9630).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, but I have a dual career,'' he said. ``I'm a
songwriter for mainstream acts that have hits, and I'm a recording
artist on my own. But I haven't been picked up by country radio. It
just doesn't seem to be in the cards.''
</P>
<P>
   AND FURTHER-MORE...: Rusted Root drummer Jim Donovan reports
that all is well at the Further Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been fantastic,'' he said. ``All the audiences have been
extremely warm, mellow and really into the music. Everyone's
dancing. Hot Tuna and the others are playing fantastic music.''
</P>
<P>
   The Further Festival comes to Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on
Wednesday. Along with Pittsburgh, Pa.-based Rusted Root and former
Jefferson Airplane side project Hot Tuna, the bill features
Grateful Dead remnants the Other Ones.
</P>
<P>
   Rusted Root, whose last album was ``Remember'' (Mercury), is
finishing up a new record produced by Susan Rogers (David Byrne,
Prince). The band has a loyal regional following even though
commercial pop radio has been resistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even from the beginning, we set ourselves up so we could have
a career regardless of radio,'' said Donovan, who recently released
a meditative solo effort, ``Indigo'' (Triloka).
</P>
<P>
   MORE MARLEY: Due next month is the second volume of ``The
Complete Bob Marley &AMP; the Wailers'' multi-disc series. The new
three-CD package features all the Wailers singles produced by Lee
``Scratch'' Perry in 1970-71.

</P>
<P>
   UNCENSORED ANIMATION: You know an animation event is really out
there when this crosses your desk:
</P>
<P>
   ``If your idea of animation is a bland feature designed to sell
hamburgers as well as tickets, then go to the freezer and make sure
Uncle Walt hasn't prematurely defrosted.''
</P>
<P>
   That's cold, but definitely apropos for ``General Chaos:
Uncensored Animation,'' showing midnight July 24 and 25 at the
University Village 3, near the USC campus. It promises animation
with a sense of ``visual electricity, moral ambiguity and a wicked
sense of the mature'' that ranges from claymation to puppetry,
cutouts to computer-generated stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty shorts in all will be screened, including works by Bill
Plymptom, the Bolex Brothers, Kathryn Travers, Stefan Eling and
Frances Lea. The Village is at 3323 S. Hoover St., Los Angeles. For
show times, call (213) 748-6321.
</P>
<P>
   WHOOPING IT UP: The upcoming slacker comedy ``BASEketball'' is
shooting to be a major player this summer, and what better way to
build buzz about America's newest sport than over beers with the
fellas.
</P>
<P>
   So, Universal Pictures is throwing the first BASEketball Pub
Crawl in Old Town Pasadena on Wednesday, where players won't get
whistled for traveling. The action starts at 7 p.m. at Moose
McGillycuddy's, moves to Barney's Pub, then Jake's Billiards, and
onto 35er for the final buzzer. Expect drink specials and contests
at every stop.
</P>
<P>
   The Bud and Miller Girls will pose for photos, movie promotional
stuff will be given away, and a King of the Slackers will be
crowned. His or her royal slackness wins VIP passes to the L.A.
premiere of the film, directed by David Zucker (``Naked Gun'') and
starring ``South Park'' co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``BASEketball'' tells the story of three guys who morph baseball
and basketball into a driveway sport that snowballs into an
American sports craze. The film opens July 31.

   CAR-SMART-NYT (Undated) _ A lot of convertibles shake, rattle
and roll. They leak and squeak, and, without the integral bracing
of solid tops, they flex like sponges when you wring them out on

   AUTO-REVIEW-HNS (Undated) - The two stretch-cab Toyota Tacoma
pickup trucks looked pretty much identical: jacked up, huge tires
on modular wheels and the initials TRD written large on the sides
of their pickup boxes. TRD stands for Toyota Racing Development.
Upon closer inspection, the difference between the two trucks is
glaring. One has a rugged four-wheel-drive system for serious
off-road work, complete with low-range gearing, that gives it the
capabilities of a mountain goat. The other truck doesn't. Called
the PreRunner, it's just a two-wheel-drive, despite its rugged
off-road styling and attitude. But before you write it off as a
mere poser, the two-wheel-drive model does have distinct
attributes. By Bob Golfen.

<P>
   SHARP-DRIVING-COX (Atlanta) _ It was like a brief trip into
automotive heaven. As a driving enthusiast, the mere mention of the
German autobahns has been like a vision of sugarplums dancing in my
head. It truly was Christmas in July during a trip to Germany. For
me, it was the ultimate treat. Traveling at speeds in excess of 110
mph, our little 170-horsepower Saab sprinted happily along, once
even legally passing a police car. What a rush! The system seems so
sensible, and it's difficult to argue its logic. Not once in more
than 600 miles of driving did I see a single accident or a tinge of
animosity between drivers. If only we could make it work on our far
superior interstate highway system. By Linda Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   MECHANIC-COX (Atlanta) _ Gasoline is a hot topic these days.
Three readers have fuel-related questions, two about fuel quality
and one about gas stations. Let's tackle the confusion about fuel
first. David Harris writes: ``I take excellent care of our three
cars (change the oil every 2,500 miles, etc.), but I buy the
cheapest gasoline I can find. How do I determine which fuel is a
good-quality fuel?'' By Nora Carter.
</P>
<P>
   TESTDRIVE-COX (Atlanta) _ Chevrolet likes to bill its Malibu
sedan, a midsize model larger than the Cavalier and smaller than
the Lumina, as ``the car you knew America could build.'' The
question that phrase begs, naturally, is, ``Well, why did it take
so long?'' By Russ DeVault.

Kansas City, and in the 1840s brave souls gathered there each
spring for the arduous journey by Conestoga wagon to the golden
West. Today Kansas City is the metropolis in the middle: 1,435
miles from Boston on the Atlantic, 1,577 from Los Angeles on the
Pacific, 829 from New Orleans to the south, 768 from the Canadian

head. It truly was Christmas in July during a trip to Germany. For
me, it was the ultimate treat. Traveling at speeds in excess of 110
mph, our little 170-horsepower Saab sprinted happily along, once
even legally passing a police car. What a rush! The system seems so
sensible, and it's difficult to argue its logic. Not once in more
than 600 miles of driving did I see a single accident or a tinge of
animosity between drivers. If only we could make it work on our far
superior interstate highway system. By Linda Sharp.

   MECHANIC-COX (Atlanta) _ Gasoline is a hot topic these days.
Three readers have fuel-related questions, two about fuel quality
and one about gas stations. Let's tackle the confusion about fuel
first. David Harris writes: ``I take excellent care of our three
cars (change the oil every 2,500 miles, etc.), but I buy the
cheapest gasoline I can find. How do I determine which fuel is a
good-quality fuel?'' By Nora Carter.
</P>
<P>
   TESTDRIVE-COX (Atlanta) _ Chevrolet likes to bill its Malibu
sedan, a midsize model larger than the Cavalier and smaller than
the Lumina, as ``the car you knew America could build.'' The
question that phrase begs, naturally, is, ``Well, why did it take
so long?'' By Russ DeVault.

   AUTO-REVIEW-BOS (Undated) _ The big new Ford F250 is super in a
lot of ways. By John R. White.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-REVIEW-AZR (Undated) _ The two stretch-cab Toyota Tacoma
pickup trucks looked pretty much identical: jacked up, huge tires
on modular wheels and the initials TRD written large on the sides
of their pickup boxes. Upon closer inspection, the difference
between the two trucks is glaring. By Bob Golfen.

<P>
   NY-SUMMER-ART-RDP (Undated) _ Summer, as always, offers a mix of
shows in the region around New York City, which for someone with a
car, a map, an appreciation for bad roadside food and an esthetic
purview big enough to encompass Caravaggio and Johnny Weissmuller
is a fair alternative to the beach.
</P>

SUMMER-NEW-JERSEY, SUMMER-HUDSON, SUMMER-LONG-ISLAND,
SUMMER-CONNECTICUT.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS-CITY (Kansas City, Mo.) _ Once this was the edge of
American civilization, a portal to the unknown. The Santa Fe,
Oregon and California Trails all started in Independence and
Westport, two small frontier towns long since melded into greater
Kansas City, and in the 1840s brave souls gathered there each
spring for the arduous journey by Conestoga wagon to the golden
West. Today Kansas City is the metropolis in the middle: 1,435
miles from Boston on the Atlantic, 1,577 from Los Angeles on the
Pacific, 829 from New Orleans to the south, 768 from the Canadian
border to the north. The precise geographic and population centers
of the country are both nearby. But more than geography makes this
the capital of Middle America. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   SPEND-CHILD-CARE-NYT (Undated) _ A growing number of companies

them on the job and away from home longer. By Julia Lawlor.

   BOOK-SPOCK-HNS (Undated) _ ``Dr. Spock: An American Life'' is

</P>
<P>
   BOOK-AUTHOR-AZR (Undated) _ Roy Blount Jr. says much of ``Be

his self-loathing is at the heart of his comedy efforts. By Anne

</P>
<P>
   KIDS-LANGUAGES-COX (Austin) _ Twice recently in a two-week
period, parents planning to relocate to the Austin, Texas, area
called the Round Rock Independent School District to find out if
Spanish is part of the elementary level curriculum there. Not in
Round Rock. Yet some local students _ those whose parents can
afford it and have made the effort to find or initiate programs _
are learning foreign languages from Spanish to Chinese to Hebrew to
Italian.
</P>
<P>
   MARRIAGE-COUNSELING-COX _ Most clergy say couples will not know
what marriage is really like until they have been married for a
year or longer. Many recommend that newlyweds have marital checkups
with a counselor after six months of marriage and again near their
first anniversary. But they insist that serious preparation is
critical for the success of many marriages. Now, the state of
Florida has discovered what clergy have long known. In June, Gov.
Lawton Chiles signed the Marriage Preparation and Preservation Act.
The law _ which will take effect next Jan. 1 _ encourages
premarital counseling and requires counseling before parents can be
divorced.

`THE THIEF': STEALING LOVE AND LOYALTY, AMONG SOME OTHER THINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end)  
 (JT)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first thing the handsome stranger steals in the Russian film
``The Thief'' is the devotion of Katya (Ekaterina Rednikova), a
dewily beautiful young mother. The year is 1952. Katya and her
6-year-old son, Sanya (Misha Philipchuk) are traveling by train
when they meet a flirtatious army officer named Tolyan (Vladimir
Mashkov), who turns out to be a dangerous fraud. Except for the
charm, nothing about Tolyan is what it seems.
</P>
<P>
   It takes time for Katya to detect this, time spent settling into
a precarious domesticity that is one of this film's best aspects.
The director, Pavel Chukhrai, brings a novelistic sense of detail
to evoking the dailiness of Soviet life under Stalin's regime.
Drawing on his own childhood memories, he presents the bustle of
communal apartments, the backdrop of grandiose Stalinist
architecture, the disruption of frequent travel on trains, the
specter of prison in a distant, snowy place. ``The Thief'' summons
this backdrop for a three-character family story that is no less
redolent of this particular era.
</P>
<P>
   As dramatically compelling as it is heavily metaphorical, ``The
Thief'' invests Tolyan with a symbolic importance that is difficult
to miss. For one thing, he has a likeness of Stalin tattooed onto
his chest. For another, his way of beguiling Katya and her
watchful, saucer-eyed son is a mixture of seduction and menace,
especially when he begins demonstrating for Sanya what it means to
be a man. The boy, whose real father is long gone and comes back to
haunt him only in fantasies, gets his first lessons in masculine
intimidation at Tolyan's side.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately falling for Tolyan in a burst of sudden heat, Katya
agrees to pretend he is her husband so that they can move into an
already-crowded apartment together. For Sanya, who shares a room
with the lovers and cannot avoid noticing their ardor, the
situation is awkward and intimidating from the start. The place is
presided over by a sharp-eyed landlady and her shoemaker husband
who raise an eyebrow or two about this family of newcomers but are
kind to Sanya. They too had children, they reveal tersely, but
their children were killed in the war.
</P>
<P>
   But Tolyan has a way of disarming anyone he meets. So the
household has grown convivial by the time he resorts to a favorite
trick: leading boozy toasts to Stalin and then encouraging all his
neighbors to visit the circus so he can be home alone. To her
horror, Katya learns she has been wooed by a shrewd burglar whose
affections are governed by expediency and scheming. Even more
angrily, she watches Tolyan revert to lady-killing. Mashkov, a
popular Russian leading man with glowering machismo and a
resemblance to Antonio Banderas, makes Tolyan's allure easy to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, ``The Thief,'' one of this year's Oscar nominees
for Best Foreign Film, becomes a lesson in disillusionment and
corruption. A young boy desperately in need of a father figure is
lured and bullied into actions he knows are wrong. A woman
experiences a bitter blend of love and fury. And a forceful,
utterly ruthless man is able to alter their lives forever. There's
as much soap opera as Stalin in this narrative. Either way,
Chukhrai invests it with strong, rueful echoes that give this story
of fatherly betrayal its insinuating power.
</P>

 &HT;    REVERSING HIMSELF, YELTSIN CHOOSES TO ATTEND CZAR'S BURIAL

   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ President Boris Yeltsin reversed his
earlier decision and pledged to attend Friday's burial of Russia's
last czar, a final erratic twist in the nation's jumbled plans to
entomb Nicholas II and his family on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise announcement from the Kremlin, Yeltsin said
Thursday he would attend the service in the former imperial capital
of St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth (about the executions) was concealed for 80 years,''
Yeltsin said. ``Tomorrow, the truth should be told, and I should
take part.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia will bury the fragmented skeletal remains of Nicholas,
his wife Alexandra, three of their five children and four family
servants. The family and their attendants were killed by a
Bolshevik firing squad in 1918, ending the 300-year reign of the
Romanovs of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's decision last month not to attend the ceremony
followed the refusal of the Russian Orthodox Church to acknowledge
the identification of the bones as that of the czar and his family,
despite exhaustive genetic testing and confirmation by an
international team of scientists.
</P>
<P>
   His decision started an avalanche of official backsliding over
what had been intended as a full-scale royal funeral designed to
celebrate Russian history and heal old wounds following the Russian
revolution and seven brutal decades of Soviet rule.
</P>
<P>
   After the church hierarchy and Yeltsin declined, a host of world
leaders, prominent royalty and Russia's top politicians decided not
to attend. The Russian government scaled back the ceremony,
spending less than $1 million on the three-day observance, which
began Wednesday in Yekaterinburg, the city where Nicholas and his
family were killed.

</P>
<P>
   As Russia's pioneering reformer in 1991, Yeltsin prompted the
unearthing of the Romanov's remains from a shallow grave in
Yekaterinburg. Yeltsin's reversal Thursday came without elaboration
about his change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   A Kremlin statement said: ``Putting to rest the remains of
innocent people who were murdered, the present generation of
Russians is striving to atone for the sins of their predecessors.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, eight decades after he abdicated and was later
exiled to Siberia before his death, Nicholas and his family
returned to St. Petersburg. Their remains were carried in nine
small coffins, flown in an Aeroflot jumbo jet to the city's Pulkovo
airport and furnished a military honor guard.
</P>
<P>
   As bagpipes moaned and drums rolled, dozens of descendants of
the Romanov family, clad in black, followed the procession into the
St. Peter and St. Paul Cathedral, burial place of czars since Peter
the Great.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people quietly lined the streets to catch a glimpse
of the motorcade as it passed through the streets of St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see the bones of the last emperor, to see history
being made, to be a part of it'' said Tatyana Salmina, 52, a worker
at a nuclear power plant who stood on a crowded sidewalk near the
czar's former residence, the Winter Palace.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional trim begins.)
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a local priest will preside over a simple ceremony
which acknowledges the family not by name, but merely as victims of
the Communist era. Wreaths will be laid, a choir will sing, cannons
will thunder and a short service will pray for the souls of the
entire family, including the two children whose bodies are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Patriarch Alexy II, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, has
sought to distance himself from the rites and will preside over a
rival service for the dead of the Soviet years at a monastery near
Moscow.

`THE MASK OF ZORRO': THE MARK OF THE Z? THE CUNNING FOX IS BACK  
 (PRODUCTION NOTES AT END)  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Mask of Zorro'' extends a tempting invitation: travel back
to the days when swashbuckling was serious business, when boyish
adventure films still had their innocence, when the bravado of
thrilling stunt work was all a movie needed in the way of special
effects. With a wealth of charismatic Zorros (two), a smashing
heroine and a dauntless love of adventure, this is hot-weather
escapism so earnestly retrograde that it seems new.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Martin Campbell, who gives it the same gaudy Bondian
brio he brought to ``Goldeneye,'' this Zorro features heroic
derring-do from three men. First and most distinguished is Don
Diego de la Vega, a k a Zorro Senior, played by a marvelously game
Anthony Hopkins with unexpectedly elegant panache. Then there is
his jokey, hot-blooded protege, the role that Antonio Banderas was
obviously born to play.
</P>
<P>
   And behind the scenes there's Robert Anderson, sword master to
the stars for 45 years (he worked with Errol Flynn), who has
choreographed the film's many sword fights with spectacular
flamboyance. If Anderson's style looks familiar, that may be
because it was he who matched light-sabers with Luke Skywalker
while dressed in a Darth Vader suit.
</P>
<P>
   There are ``Star Wars'' overtones to the story here, too, since
``The Mask of Zorro'' draws on the relationship between mentor and
hero-in-training with the same debt to Joseph Campbell's mythic
motifs. None too seriously, you understand _ just well enough to
keep the film's castanets clicking. This format requires an early
tragedy, and that happens when Zorro Senior loses his raven-haired
wife and baby daughter to the evil Don Rafael Montero (Stuart
Wilson), an early-19th-century Spanish governor of Alta California.
There's something irresistibly quaint about the moment when Zorro
and his wife, while sharing a tender moment at home, suddenly find
themselves surrounded by a dozen sword-clanking soldiers who
somehow crept noiselessly into the house.
</P>
<P>
   Though the dashing Don Diego has donned the Zorro mask to fight
Spanish oppression (see assorted Zorro reruns on the late show for
further details), circumstances now demand that he vanish for 20
years. He turns up again in the midst of a scraggly, unwashed crowd
who can be described only as wretches in this context. Meanwhile,
no less scraggly is a hapless thief named Alejandro Murieta
(Banderas) who has his own grisly reasons for hating Don Rafael.
</P>
<P>
   It also happens that when Alejandro was a young boy, in the
film's first big swashbuckling scene, he helped to save Don Diego's
life. Later, when they meet as adults and Don Diego does him a good
turn, Alejandro asks, ``Why are you so eager to help me?'' Don
Diego replies, ``Because, long ago, you did the same for me.'' (The
dialogue all sounds like that.) From here, it's not long before
these two begin their Zorro lessons. Clowning merrily without
jeopardizing his smolder quotient, Banderas is shaped most
endearingly into a protege worthy of mask, steed, mission and the
works.
</P>
<P>
   Gracing ``The Mask of Zorro'' with a beauty inevitably described
as ``beyond compare'' is the stunning Catherine Zeta-Jones. She
plays Elena, Don Diego's long-lost and predictably raven-haired
daughter, and she does it so showstoppingly that the film's appeal
extends well beyond boyish action-adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Enchantingly paired with Banderas for a scorching tango, a
hearty duel, a scene in a confessional that has him impersonating a
priest and other such vintage-style encounters, Ms. Zeta-Jones
makes her first major film role one to remember. It's worth noting
that her bold, alluring Elena is one of numerous strong movie
heroines (Jennifer Lopez in ``Out of Sight,'' Cameron Diaz in
``There's Something About Mary,'' Rene Russo in ``Lethal Weapon
4,'' the animated Mulan) on screen this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Though its major sets and vistas have their blatant
artificiality, there's nothing phony about the vigorous, sometimes
jokey physical exertions on which ``The Mask of Zorro'' thrives.
The wild bravado on horseback is on a par with dueling scenes. And
as for the double who jumps spread-legged onto his saddle from a
substantial height, well, he's a hero, too.
</P>
<P>
   The costume designer Graciela Mazon, who had been warming up
Banderas for Zorro duty in ``From Dusk Till Dawn'' and
``Desperado,'' lives up to the occasion with all the boots and
corsets and flamenco chic that the material warrants. James
Horner's atmospheric score frequently summons the memory of
``Malaguena,'' giving the film all the beguiling hokum it needs. &QL;

   PRODUCTION NOTES
</P>
<P>
   THE MASK OF ZORRO
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``The Mask of Zorro'' is rated PG-13. It includes

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A carnival-sized crowd in blue suits and neckties
abruptly pulled stakes at the end of the speech, and the carpeted
warehouse in which NASA keeps its biggest space training equipment
ebbed into a hush.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of the president can do that to a room, even one
this big and industrial: drain it of so many people so quickly it
feels like the air has left, too. Spectators, security officers,
television cameras with their clacking bird legs, all suddenly
gone. Out.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone split with President Clinton after his tour of
the Johnson Space Center on this hot April afternoon. The seven
bright crew members of the space shuttle Discovery still kicked
around on NASA's royal blue carpet, still buzzing a bit from the
VIP glow. With one exception.
</P>
<P>
   Payload specialist John Glenn, a native Ohioan, was not high on
the thrill of having been with the president, something he does now
and then in his day job. Instead he enjoyed a more precious moment:
hanging out with his space ship crew.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the glare, off camera, Glenn reveled in the
camaraderie of being John rather than Senator Glenn, dribbling out
M&AMP;Ms to all hands, swapping tastes of the space food that was
sampled by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Laughing in the glory of it. Biting a steaming fork of
rehydrated shrimp cocktail offered by a crew mate who declared it
``the Cadillac of space food.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, this is great!'' Glenn said, mouth open, chewing, hot.
``May have shrimp for breakfast, lunch and dinner, I don't know. I
found out one thing in tasting it: stir it up a little bit. If you
get down to the corner (of the plastic bag) where that horseradish
is concentrated, Ohhhhhh!''
</P>
<P>
   America is waiting for John Glenn's return to glory with the
shuttle launch in October, but Glenn himself is not. He turned 77
Saturday(NOTE: JULY 18), and for him the glory is already back.
</P>
<P>
   He is tenacious yet patient in the pursuit of his mission, and
those traits have served him well. That's why he broke the coast-to
coast flight record in 1957. Why, in 1962, he became the first
American in orbit. And that is why, come Oct. 29, he'll be the
oldest human to fly in space
</P>
<P>
   The launch is not for months, but the mission is already
underway. It's in the endless training on shuttle systems and the
poring over experiment manuals. It's him dangling down the side of
a life-sized shuttle trainer and mastering _ at long last since
he's been so slow warming to the new computers in his Senate office
_ the high-powered laptops that run some of the science experiments
aboard the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm enjoying every minute of it,'' Glenn said that day in
Houston, ``want to spend all the time here I can getting ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe that.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Lt. Col. Glenn rocketed through a clearing sky above
Cape Canaveral on that late February morning in 1962, he already
knew something about fame. Before the ticker tape parades and the
presidential medals and the speech before Congress, Glenn had
introduced his face to America.
</P>
<P>
   He teamed with youngster Eddie Hodges, who went on to a brief
Broadway career, to win about $25,000 on the television game show
Name that Tune in October of 1957. A former glee club member and a
life-long devotee to a good barbershop quartet, Glenn made big
money by quickly recognizing such tunes as Far Away Places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some gal just walked up to him... `` remembers Glenn's
longest, closest friend, retired Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Tom Miller,
75. ``She didn't recognize him or anything, said, 'How'd you like
to be on a show?'''
</P>
<P>
   Recognize him? Yeah, Glenn was famous even before that. Months
before this CBS talent scout spotted him shopping in the New York,
Glenn made headlines by setting a cross-country speed record. The
mission was Operation Bullet, which Glenn invented and named, and
it involved flying the F8U jet at supersonic speeds from Los
Angeles to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to wring out a supersonic engine over more than
three hours of high-powered flight time to see how it stood up. At
the same time, Glenn hoped to snag the spotlight for the Marines by
setting a record. Worked like a charm. The plane did beautifully
and Glenn, one of two pilots who took off that morning, was the
only one who didn't have to bail out before New York making the
trip faster than if he'd ridden a bullet fired from a .45 caliber
gun.
</P>
<P>
   When the Marines nominated Glenn for the Harmon Trophy, an
international aviator's prize that had previously been won by Chuck
Yeager and Howard Hughes, the Corps gave him all the credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be worth mentioning that it was largely through
repeated efforts on the part of the major that the Navy and the
Defense Department permitted the flight to be made,'' the Harmon
application reads. ``Three times (Glenn) had submitted detailed
proposals and flight statistics before, on the fourth try, his
efforts bore fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn didn't win the award, but he chiseled out a reputation for
rare tenacity. Anyone who saw him make the speed record his
personal mission knew Glenn would be a guy who didn't just beat the
odds, he'd wear them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always starts from behind and winds up in the front
ranks,'' said retired Adm. James Stockdale, who was in Glenn's
class at test pilot school. ``Covered everything in his life
because he'll take on a task without necessarily having all the law
degrees and all that stuff. He's willing to get in there and learn
it as he goes. And he's still doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockdale became famous as Ross Perot's running mate in the
presidential election of 1992, but before his late-in-life
political debut he was a fighter pilot, Vietnam prisoner of war and
Congressional Medal of Honor winner. He tutored Glenn in physics
and calculus at the test pilot school in Patuxent River, Maryland
in early `54 because Glenn had left college before graduating to
fly in World War II. In exchange, Glenn taught the Naval Academy
grad to fly jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew within himself that he had the capacity to learn fast
enough to keep up with almost any academic experience,'' Stockdale
said.
</P>
<P>
   By launch day, Glenn will have spent nearly 500 hours in
training. He will know the essentials of living in orbit from
sleeping to using the bathroom (the toilet is vacuum sealed with
spring-loaded clamps that hold the astronaut in place). He'll
understand the rudiments of the shuttle life support systems and
radio operations, and he's been put in charge of the flight's still
and video photography.
</P>
<P>
   When he's done Glenn still won't be schooled in how to fly the
shuttle, but he'll be qualified for a job as a television news
cameraman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Senator's down here we try to keep him busy because
we do have him for a limited period of time and we want him to be
as prepared with all the orbiter systems as we can,'' said Curt
Brown, Glenn's shuttle flight commander. ``Plus, he has a whole
suite of life science experiments that he has started.''
</P>
<P>
   He returns to Washington saddled with reading material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do we load him up,'' said Steve Williams, training
manager for Glenn's flight, ``but he loads himself up. He's a real
interesting man to work with. He wants more than is the minimum
required to perform the job. We give him the information that's
required to do the job, and he's looking for the next level of
detail, the next level of depth of knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Industriousness is not something Glenn developed for NASA. Or
the Marines for that matter. Growing up in New Concord, a pretty
Presbyterian town about 70 miles east of Columbus, Glenn got a car
only when he made a clunker on his dad's Chevy lot run. (Mr. Glenn
was a plumber by trade, but had a car dealership in tiny New
Concord.) And he only got money as a boy by harvesting rhubarbs
from the family garden and selling them from a wagon. ``I was the
rhubarb king of New Concord!'' he boasts.
</P>
<P>
   He also was a model airplane builder who loved the taste of
speed. That old Chevy was a convertible whose top had long ago
rotted away, and Glenn never replaced it. He drilled holes in the
floor to drain the rain, and has had rag tops ever since. Yes, even
today.
</P>
<P>
   But flying was something Glenn took to as soon as he could.
Muskingum College, right there in New Concord, offered flying
lessons for physics credit under a federal program designed to
build a supply of combat pilots as World War II approached. The
class was taught on a grass field 50 miles away, but that didn't
deter Glenn. No surprise there, he just drove.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Glenn insists the whole space shuttle thing began
accidentally. He swears he wasn't fishing for a way back into the
astronaut program, to get that second space shot he was denied
during Project Mercury. President Kennedy reportedly had decided
Glenn was too popular to risk his life with another rocket flight.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was preparing for NASA's budget hearings in the summer of
1996 when he stumbled across a medical chart that listed the
multitude of physiological reactions the human body has to
prolonged weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   He saw muscle atrophy and cardiovascular shifts, and
sleeplessness and weakening of the immune system. Brittling of the
bones. Dozens of changes to the body that astronauts endure in
weightlessness before recovering fully soon after returning to the
gentle pull of earth's gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn had a thought. He snatched a medical book on geriatrics,
and there he saw another chart listing the many painful effects of
normal human aging. Muscle atrophy and cardiovascular shifts,
sleeplessness and weakening of the immune system. Brittling of the
bones.
</P>
<P>
   As a man in his 70s, Glenn was becoming familiar with some of
these conditions, though he has been stalling them as best he could
with a diet of perpetual moderation and a devotion to brisk 2-mile
walks four or five times a week.
</P>
<P>
   NASA already was working with the National Institute of Aging, a
part of the National Institutes of Health, on some of these same
issues but experts there hadn't yet proposed sending an elderly
person into space to see if an aged body would react any
differently than younger astronaut bodies do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got into this thing and developed what I thought was a
rationale for somebody (in his age group) going,'' Glenn said, ``to
look into these particular areas. And if I could do it, why,
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn admits it wasn't really that casual for him. What he
saw in those medical books was more than some interesting facts
that made him curious. What Glenn saw in those medical books was a
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Within months he was on the floor of the Senate reading from
NASA documents about the similar effects of aging and space travel,
sharpening his rationale, taking it to the public through C-SPAN.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could have the very personal attention of every
person in this country who is 60 years of age or older,'' Glenn
said from the floor. ``One thing that has happened in the look into
the life and biosciences in the NASA program has been that we find
some notable parallels between what happens to astronauts in space
and what happens to the elderly right here on earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if we can find what triggers some of these similarities,
perhaps we will have a whole new handle on approaching difficulties
that people have right here on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before that, he'd gone to see NASA Administrator Dan
Goldin, a President Bush appointee who found himself being asked to
approve sending into space a man born not many years after the
Wright Brothers triumphed at Kitty Hawk.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, the issue was more than age because this was not
just any fit-as-a-fiddle grandfather. John Glenn is a national
icon, a Cold War and Real War hero, the very personification of
America's pioneering work in space. Glenn didn't just ride
America's first space capsule into orbit, he designed the
instrument panel. It would be like bringing back Henry Ford to race
the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   It was an opportunity of great poetry and great danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The space frontier is unforgiving to error,'' Goldin said.
``It was a very big decision that had to be made. You know, it was
not a comfortable decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants to be the guy whose decision to send America's John
Glenn back into space accidently kills him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was uncomfortable in the sense, here is a national hero,''
Goldin said. ``President Kennedy made just the opposite decision. I
mean, the President of the United States decided not fly him
because he was a national hero. So it was uncomfortable in that
sense because I was going to override what President Kennedy had
decided some 30 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldin made a list of requirements that would have to be met
before he'd agree to the flight. The science experiments would have
to be legit, Glenn's health would have to be a certainty, the White
House would have to stay out of the process, and Glenn's wife Annie
would have to be consulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know her and I called her,'' Goldin said of Glenn's wife
since 1943. ``You know what she said to me? `This is what John
wants to do. I've been with him for 55 years, I'm going to support
him.' ``
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, Glenn, as he is want to do, just kept coming.
</P>
<P>
   Need the experiments peer reviewed? Fine, tell me if I can
provide anything to help. Want me to pass a physical? Fine, you
pick the doctor. Need my medical history? No problem, I've been
sending NASA my annual physicals every year since I left the space
program in 1964. Between NASA and the Marines, the government has
most every one since I was in college.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin insisted on no medical waivers, ``and I said, `Fair
enough,'' Glenn said. He told his 52-year-old son David, a
physician in California, about all the medical tests he'd undergone
and the younger Glenn concluded that NASA had done everything but
an autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn was not content to sit back and wait for the signal.
He started calling Goldin. To check. How's it going? What's cooking
on my idea for a shuttle flight? Have you heard anything new? Can I
get you any more information?
</P>
<P>
   About that time, Tom Miller got a call at home in Arlington.
This is the same Arlington house he lived in back in 1962, which is
next door to the house the Glenn's owned at the time -_ the Millers
and Glenns built the houses side by side _ the house where Annie
Glenn and the two teenaged Glenn kids watched America's first
orbital flight, and where Vice President Lyndon Johnson dropped by
that historic day.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Goldin was on the phone. He needed suggestions for dealing
with Glenn, Miller says. The senator was driving folks at NASA
crazy. But Miller didn't have much advice to offer on taming this
guy he'd known since flight school 50 years ago. It was more like a
warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Dan, `You're in contact with the most persistent person
I've ever known.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not many things make John Glenn squirm. Nerves of steel are part
of the legend, part of the hero package. After all, he's a fighter
pilot who flew 149 combat missions In World War II and Korea and
collected a host of medals in the process. This after losing a
friend to anti-aircraft fire in combat mission number one.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn has met with world leaders, and even made a hearty but
failed attempt to become one, losing his 1984 bid for president. He
was in California with Bobby Kennedy the night he was killed, and
flew to Boston in the morning to tell the Kennedy children.
</P>
<P>
   He's faced difficult things, and that's not to say things don't
effect him, but he handles them. Whatever it is, he deals.
</P>
<P>
   But something does unnerve Glenn, or at least take him out of
his stride, make him a little less sure-footed than his fighter
pilot confidence would like: the whole topic of his flight that
doesn't deal very specifically with the scientific research, the
procedures, the quantifiable.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin has been up front in saying that while defensible
scientific research made the Glenn flight possible, that's not all
that's going on. Goldin says he wanted to give Glenn the second
space flight he didn't get before, and has said several times that
``Inspiration is a part of the American psyche.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn might be flattered, but he's not letting on: ``I've heard
him say that... that it goes beyond (science). And I suppose
there's that aspect to it, that someone going up at my age...
whether it will be an inspiration, I don't... Define inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it make me an inspiration to older people to be more
active or will it affect younger peoples' view that the elderly are
not people just to be put away in a bin? You know, will there be
that aspect to it? I suppose there will. But that wasn't the design
when we were starting out. We didn't set out to design it to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, at least some of Glenn's reticence may be to deflect
the charges of critics who say his flight has little scientific
value and is instead a nostalgic adventure. John Pike, director of
space policy for the Federation of American Scientists, doesn't
oppose Glenn's return to space, just the rationale being proffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question you have to ask is, why are we doing this?'' Pike
said. ``We're doing it because it's John Glenn, we're not doing it
because he's a geezer.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn of course bristles at this idea, pointing out that the
National Institute on Aging had a pair of conferences to discuss
his flight .
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought in experts from all over the country to talk
about...'' Glenn said, ``would we learn enough by doing this, or do
we have the potential of learning enough that they should really
back it and get into it. And after these two national conferences
they had, why they decided yes they'd do it. They thought there was
real merit to this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreed, says Pike. The science is not ``completely bogus,'' but
neither is it essential nor likely to result in any breakthroughs
in the aging process of people on earth, he said. Pike said the
space program would benefit most from Glenn's flight if Glenn would
embrace the cultural significance of a space hero returning to
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not useful, it's glorious,'' Pike said. ``I wish he would
get off this medical stuff and give us some pep talks.''
</P>
<P>
   On the medical stuff, Glenn will be involved in two age-related
experiments, as both a researcher and a guinea pig. One will study
the way certain proteins are processed during weightlessness, in
the hopes that researchers will gain a hint about what causes
muscle weakening in space. The other will look into sleep patterns
by comparing the circadian rhythm, or biological clock that governs
alertness and sleepiness, between Glenn and others in the crew.
</P>
<P>
   For those two studies, Glenn will give blood 12 times in nine
days. Flight engineer, Dr. Scott Parazynski, who's on his third
shuttle mission, will insert a catheter into Glenn's arm so he'll
only be stuck with a needle four times.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn will talk about the science all day. He can recount from
memory the minute details of each shuttle procedure he must know,
tossing in extra info like how fast the ship will be traveling when
he does this thing or that. He can talk about the crew flying with
him on this flight, effusively respectful of each one of them. But
he's never been one to offer details from his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Even going back to Project Mercury, America's first space
program. Glenn talked longest and soonest in those press
conferences with the seven original astronauts, but it was all
about the work, not the feeling he got from the work.
</P>
<P>
   Example: That first orbital flight concluded with a harrowing
period during reentry into earth's atmosphere when everyone thought
his heat shield might have slipped loose, which would have meant
instant incineration of the capsule. America waited long minutes in
one of the nation's first truly unifying television moments to see
if the shield was still attached and Glenn was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   In retelling that moment, Glenn described his state of mind in
the capsule as `concerned.' And that's not today, looking back on a
tough moment 36 years ago, that's back then. On the Navy destroyer
that picked him up.
</P>
<P>
   So now, faced with the cultural significance of his return to
space as an elderly man, the shameless romance of it, the grand
potential for it to inspire young and old... well, you heard him,
that's not part of the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I leave it to other people to make observations about
whether they think that's going to occur or not,'' Glenn said. ``I
don't PROpose or OPPose, I guess. If it's going to have that
effect, and other people think it will have that effect, well fine,
maybe that's a good, maybe that's a good benefit from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's wife Annie is a bit like him on matters such as these,
at least publicly. His true love since high school, she's been
stiff-upper-lipping it for a long, long time. Just a few weeks ago,
milling about at Johnson Space Center while Glenn and the crew
worked through the routine they'll follow upon first achieving
orbit, Annie shrugged at questions about the dangers involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the scary type like it was before because back then
it was so, so unknown,'' she said. ``I had confidence then, but you
just didn't know. But he was a test pilot so that's just one of
those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Suggest to her that he still is, and she laughs and nods
approvingly. ``He keeps me going. He keeps me alert.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Glenns concede that the family was at first
``cool'' to the idea of his return to space, everyone has since
climbed aboard. Glenn has had both his children and the two grand
kids out to Houston for a tour of the simulators he'll begin
training in shortly. And Annie is with him for most of his sessions
at the space center.
</P>
<P>
   She says seeing things firsthand has helped her overcome the
butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, you have to,'' she said flatly. ``I'm very lucky that I
can learn what's going to affect him, and I can watch him in
training or attend classes. And he's really so excited. So
tickled.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the science, he wants to make clear. The science. After
every question about what it means to him personally, Glenn swings
back to the mission like a compass finding true north. ``I always
wanted to go up again,'' he'll say, ``but that's sort of beside the
point...''
</P>
<P>
   Until finally, in his Washington office with the Senate computer
behind him cued to the shuttle Discovery's webpage, he lets a door
drift open. Yes, there was something about the first space flight
that moved him. And held him. In a rare, fleeting moment, he
confesses that much. Behind the Cold Warrior exulting in the power
of American ingenuity there was this guy from Ohio who as a kid
made model airplanes and as a grown up got to look down on the
earth the way angels do. He agrees, now, that it was spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not spiritual in the idea that you expect to run into God or
anything like that,'' he says. ``But a spiritual quality in that
having such a different vantage point to look at creation, even
though you're not that far away from earth, but to look at it from
that new kind of vantage point can't help but give you a greater
appreciation for all this creation we live in.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's squirming. This is clearly off the mission. Tenacity
and discipline don't help explain the way a single day in orbit, 4
hours and 55 minutes in a metal can no bigger than a refrigerator,
could grip a person's imagination for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose when you've had an experience like that you're a
little different person when you come back,'' Glenn says, trying.
``You've seen things that very few people have ever seen, and that
can't help but... I guess it maybe makes you... maybe a little more
tolerant of life in general or you're not quite so prone to be
critical of everything that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   He shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's a poor way to put it, I don't know.''

`POLISH WEDDING': A CELLAR FULL OF PICKLES AND SOUP MADE OF BLOOD 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   When Lena Olin, looking stunningly slim and sensual as Jadzia
Pzoniak, a Polish-American cleaning woman, tells her lover Roman
(Rade Serbedzija) that her body has been so ravaged by having
children her husband doesn't look at her anymore, you wonder what
body she could possibly be talking about. The discrepancy between
what comes out of her mouth and what is visible on the screen isn't
the worst problem with Theresa Connelly's muddled film ``Polish
Wedding,'' but it is glaring enough to make you question everything
else about this aggressively sentimental, nearly laugh-free comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Jadzia, her husband, Bolek (Gabriel Byrne), and their brood of
four sons and one daughter, along with a daughter-in-law and a
grandchild, live in a crowded house on the outskirts of Detroit.
The movie aspires to be one of those zany ethnic comedies
celebrating the vitality and earthiness of American working-class
life that Hollywood has been trying unsuccessfully to re-make ever
since ``Moonstruck.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jadzia, who favors revealingly low-cut, bright red dresses,
announces that ``making life and love'' are her ``religion,'' you
are supposed to think how much more rooted and healthily in touch
with their basic instincts these people are than everybody else.
For Jadzia, being in touch with her basic instincts means that when
her boyfriend steals into the men's room she is cleaning, she
promptly tackles him and throws him down on the tile floor awash
with soapy water. It means that when Roman offers her a trip to
Paris, she says no, insisting no other city in the world could be
more wonderful than beautiful Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   All that spontaneous self-expression and robust sensuality must
owe partly to the hearty fare Jadzia likes to serve her family. She
has a whole cellar full of pickles. One of the delicacies she
ladles out over the dinner table is a homemade soup made of duck's
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Jadzia is not ashamed to admit that many years ago she and Bolek
had to get married because she was pregnant. Now her only daughter,
Hala (Claire Danes), is running wild the same way she did. When
Hala sneaks out of a basement window night after night to roll
around on the grass with Russell (Adam Trese), a handsome young
policeman who lives in the neighborhood, her basic instincts take
over just as her mom's did. The situation becomes dicey when Hala
agrees to represent virginity in an annual church procession.
</P>
<P>
   With its duck's blood soup and pickles, ``Polish Wedding''
offers ample opportunities for rough-and-tumble family farce. But
none of its humor is allowed to run free. That's because the movie
would like more than anything to be a nostalgically heartwarming
slice of working-class Polish Americana. At the same time, it is so
intent on not striking any downbeat notes of kitchen-sink realism
that the very real problems its characters face _ adultery,
unmarried pregnancy and ethnic discrimination _ have no dramatic
weight. Lost in a stylistic limbo, the most ``Polish Wedding'' can
muster is an attitude that could be described as wanly cute.
</P>

WORLDWIDE LAWS OF LIFE:  
 HUMILITY IS THE HIGHEST FORM OF SELF-RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>

Henry David Thoreau)
</P>
<P>
   (Sir John Templeton, the Tennessee-born billionaire and founder
of the Templeton funds, built his fortune on his legendary ability
to perceive value that others overlooked. In his column, he urges
us to recognize the value of spirituality in life.)

</P>
<P>
   If you walk outside on a clear, dark night and look up into the
sky you can see thousands of stars. Did you ever consider that if
it were not for the darkness of space the starlight would never be
revealed to us on Earth?
</P>
<P>
   We tend to think of anything dark or black as bad and perhaps
not as valuable as white or light. Or, we may perceive black as
nothing at all since it has no color. Scientifically, it is the
absence of light and could be called an illusion, or invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Going to a movie can remind you of how important it is for the
theater to be dark, for it is the darkness that allows the movie to
be seen most clearly.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the heavenly light within each one of us -- our divine
purpose of potential -- also has a dark background against which it
becomes illumined. This is not a destructive or negative darkness,
rather a necessary foundation of strength. Could this darkness
perhaps be what is called humility: our ability to admit we may not
know everything or be all things to all people?
</P>
<P>
   Humility is not self-deprecation. To believe that you have no
worth, or were created somehow flawed or incompetent, can be
foolish. Humility represents wisdom. It is knowing you were created
with special talents and abilities to share with the world; but it
can also be an understanding that you are one of many souls created
by God, and each has an important role to play in life.
</P>
<P>
   Humility is knowing you are smart, but not all-knowing. It is
accepting that you have personal power, but are not omnipotent.
</P>
<P>
   The unseen -- the beauty that exists as potential in each of us
-- is what makes us alive. If we don't believe we're alive with
inner potential, we may not be progressive in our life.
</P>
<P>
   But if we are aware of the tremendous potential within and the
value of our self-worth, we can understand that the true reality
abides in God.
</P>
<P>
   When we reach this stage of maturity and moral development, we
can become consistently more productive and useful. We may also
become more outgoing. We can feel a surge of joy when others
experience good fortune. The desire to accomplish something of
lasting benefit can reside at the forefront of our thoughts and
bring us closer to success.
</P>
<P>
   As a tree requires a strong root system to grow tall, or a
skyscraper must have a deep foundation to hold tension against
stress, we need the strength of humility to reach our greatest
heights. This strength can serve as our foundation for living and
help us step forth in faith and valiantly challenge life, daring to
take risks.
</P>
<P>
   Wise is the person whose love of work, of family and friends, of
colleagues and peers, and of life itself stems from his love of
God. We have unlimited potential to create, but it must be rooted
in the knowledge of understanding of the perimeters of our personal
power.
</P>
<P>
   The humble attitude is a flexible attitude. Just as the tree and
the building must sway with the wind, our agility in dealing with
whatever life throws our way can become our strength.
</P>
<P>
   Inherent in humility resides an open and receptive mind. We
don't know all the answers to life, and sometimes not even the
right questions have been revealed to us.
</P>
<P>
   Humility can be a strength that serves well; it leaves us more
open to learn from others and refrains from seeing issues and
people only in blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite of humility is arrogance -- the belief that we are
wiser or better than others. Arrogance promotes separation rather
than community. It looms like a brick wall between us and those
from whom we could learn.
</P>
<P>
   An example could be Virginia Smith, a young woman who was about
to graduate from college with honors. She held a high opinion of
herself and lofty visions of greatness. As Virginia descended from
the podium in her cap and gown, she carried her diploma ... and an
air of intellectual smugness.
</P>
<P>
   From out of the crowd of onlookers an old woman stepped to
Virginia's side. We can call her Wisdom of the World. She spoke
casually to the young graduate, ``Well, who have we here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You evidently don't know me,'' said the young woman in an
arrogant tone. ``I am Virginia Cordelia Smith, A.B.S.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, my young friend,'' said Wisdom of the World with a
chuckle, ``Come with me and I will teach you the rest of your
alphabet.''
</P>
<P>
   This young woman undoubtedly contained a bright light to shine
on the world. She had great potential for doing good, but she had
yet to understand how much of life would be a mystery to her.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa of Avila made the comment, ``Humility must always be
doing its work like a bee making honey in the hive: without
humility all will be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   If the young graduate could only gain humility, her ``heavenly
light'' could surely shine and her life would be much sweeter.

`MARK TWAIN'S AMERICA IN 3-D': TALL TALES ON A TALL SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.)  
 (js)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As an experienced Mississippi riverboat pilot, Mark Twain surely
knew shallows when he saw them. So he'd probably steer well clear
of the thin murky brew sloshing around under the title ``Mark
Twain's America in 3-D,'' the latest Imax attraction.
</P>
<P>
   But as a venture capitalist who thrilled to inventions but, to
his financial detriment, didn't always know a good one when he saw
it (he turned down Alexander Graham Bell), Twain might have enjoyed
the film's three-dimensional effects while turning his withering
scorn on its pretensions to biography, history and social
relevance.
</P>
<P>
   The boy in him that blessed the world with Tom Sawyer and Huck
Finn would probably have got a chuckle while flinching from the
mud-drenched, volleyball-playing girl who seems to fly right off
the screen and at the onlooker. In this film, houses seem real;
huge trees seem to sprout right out of the middle of the theater,
and the locomotive of a train on the Virginia &AMP; Truckee Railroad, a
line Twain himself once traveled on his way west, seems to roar
into the audience.
</P>
<P>
   From the scenic standpoint, ``Mark Twain's America'' has its
rewards. But as it skips around between present and past, from
color and 3-D segments of modern riverboats, restored trains, the
annual Tom Sawyer Days celebration in Twain's hometown of Hannibal,
Mo., and his home in Hartford, to old black-and-white photographs
of slaves, mining towns and train wrecks, the film loses its
figurative focus.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to stitch Twain's biography to the broader history of the
times he lived in and then to the America of today, the hodgepodge
of images, old and new, begins to look like some cinematic salad,
tossed together more as a matter of convenience than coherence,
with the pictorial outweighing the truly pertinent.
</P>
<P>
   Twain's busy, adventurous literary and personal life
(1835-1910), which was filled with rewards and tragedy, coincided
with the Civil War, America's westward expansion and its explosive
growth as an industrial nation. And if ``Mark Twain's America''
can't do justice to all this in its relatively brief running time,
it can at least be enjoyed for its 3-D effects and appreciated for
the curiosity it might arouse for a fuller acquaintance with
Twain's life, work and American history.
</P>
<P>
   With a narration by Anne Bancroft and some of Twain's words
spoken in a treacly style by Dennis O'Connor, the film was written,
directed and produced by Stephen Low, whose credits include
``Across the Sea of Time'' and ``Titanica.''

ART REVIEW: LANDSCAPES, ARCHITECTURE AND MIRO ON LONG ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: SUMMER-NEW-JERSEY, SUMMER-HUDSON, SUMMER-CONNECTICUT,
AND SUMMER-RDP)  
(lh) 
 By KEN JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Appropriately for the season, tranquillity prevails at the art
museums of Long Island, N.Y. From the Nassau County Museum of Art,
the Heckscher Museum of Art and the Museums at Stony Brook along
the North Shore to the Parrish Art Museum, Guild Hall and
Pollock-Krasner House in the Hamptons, the offerings are
interesting, sometimes delightful and, on the whole, comfortably
familiar. There's little to disturb anyone's summertime bliss.
</P>
<P>
   NASSAU COUNTY MUSEUM: If you can visit only one, make it the
Nassau County Museum of Art in Roslyn Harbor. Set in a bucolic
145-acre park, the Georgian mansion that Henry Clay Frick gave his
son Childs as a wedding present is the site of two thoroughly
appealing exhibitions: an extended comparison of the works of
Alexander Calder and Joan Miro, and a selection of prints by Henri
de Toulouse-Lautrec from the Baldwin M. Baldwin Collection.
</P>
<P>
   To associate Miro and Calder is not an original idea. The
artists admired and influenced each other, and, as Constance
Schwartz, who is the co-curator of the show with Franklin Perrell,
notes in her catalog essay, as early as 1936 Calder's mobiles had
been described as ``Miro abstractions come to life.'' Nevertheless,
to see such kindred spirits play off each other like jazz musicians
in this well-selected show is exhilarating and revelatory.
</P>
<P>
   The satisfaction is partly formal. Miro and Calder both liked to
set eccentrically curvey lines and flat, biomorphic shapes floating
freely in space. It's nice to see how that happens in the fictive
space of Miro's painting versus the real space of Calder's
sculpture. On the other hand, in contrast to Miro's tendency to
enrich pictorial space, creating allover fields of quirky
symbolism, Calder tends to pare down his works to elemental
structures, moving away from Miro's Surrealism toward
Constructivism.
</P>
<P>
   Miro and Calder also share certain imaginative and spiritual
predilections. They both work out of childlike states of mind,
producing images of toylike people and friendly animals in magical
spaces where the laws of adult gravity have been rescinded. For
both artists, the child is the doorway to the unconscious, and the
unconscious becomes a source of cosmic transcendentalism, a dreamy
theater of archetypes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both artists tie this playful, mystical primitivism to a
rigorous formal pragmatism, often to comical effect, as in Calder's
``Cow With Yellow Face'' (1971), a construction of flat sheets of
steel with teats attached by steel loops, or Miro's ``Pastorale''
(1923-24), a farmscape populated by a fish, a cow and other life
forms schematically abstracted with a kind of scientific precision.
</P>
<P>
   To climb the museum stairs to the Toulouse-Lautrec exhibition is
to move to another century but not to another universe because he
is, like Calder and Miro, a modern artist and an endlessly witty
and inventive draftsman. There is also in his work a childlike
desire to play and to be entertained, coupled with a hard-working
concentration on form and material.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of this exhibition is an 1896 series of
lithographs called ``Elles,'' representing scenes in Parisian
brothels. The series calls to mind Degas' bathers, but it has more
narrative tenderness. Toulouse-Lautrec does not objectify his
subjects formally or sexually; rather he empathizes, as in ``Femme
sur le Dos: Lassitude,'' in which a young woman lies on her back on
a luxuriantly rumpled bed gazing in private reverie at the ceiling.
Printed in sanguine ink on a dark olive-green field, the print has
a misty subtlety to match the image's drifting mood.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing else in the show is so psychologically evocative, but in
dozens of posters, theater programs and portraits of actors,
Toulouse-Lautrec's graphic ingenuity, talent for caricature and
alertness to contemporary fashion are well displayed.
</P>
<P>
   HECKSCHER MUSEUM OF ART: The two remaining North Shore museums
are focusing on artists associated with Long Island. At the
Heckscher, a blocky concrete temple set next to a duck pond in the
middle of Huntington, is an exhibition devoted to William de
Leftwich Dodge (1867-1935), a once famous muralist who created
public works for the Library of Congress, the State House in
Albany, N.Y., and various international exhibitions. In 1906, Dodge
built a Greek Revival mansion in Setauket, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A facile academician trained in Europe (he studied with
Jean-Leon Gerome), Dodge shifted styles easily, moving between
old-fashioned history painting, trendy illustration and plein-air
Impressionism. At best, in modest, impressionistic paintings, he
shows a convincing sensitivity to light and paint, as in a small
dark view of boats on San Francisco Bay or Sargent-like gouaches
representing views in and around Villa Francesca, as he called his
estate. But no coherent artistic identity emerges from this show,
and one leaves with the feeling that Dodge's obscurity is not
undeserved.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodge show is supplemented by two exhibitions drawn mostly
from the Heckscher's permanent collections. ``Americans in Paris:
Studies and Sojourns Abroad'' is a selection of works by Americans
who studied in Europe around the same time as Dodge. It includes
some very fine pieces, like a small study for ``The Cello Player,''
by Thomas Eakins, and a male nude drawn in charcoal by Thomas
Anshutz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Country Pleasures: Views of Long Island'' presents an
assortment of restful landscapes and seascapes by several dozen
Long Islanders, including Arthur Dove, Paul Georges and Casimir
Rutkowski, whose painterly view of a leafy residential neighborhood
typifies the show's pastoral mood.
</P>
<P>
   Dove and his wife, Helen Torr, who lived in nearby Centerport,
are also given a tiny exhibition of small, lively works on paper in
the museum lobby, along with a display of tools, materials and
memorabilia from his studio.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   MUSEUMS OF STONY BROOK: The Museums of Stony Brook, a collection
of low-lying, wooden buildings, are featuring an exhibition about
the Long Island projects of Stanford White (1853-1906), the Gilded
Age architect and libertine who designed the original Pennsylvania
Station in Manhattan, the Boston Public Library and other major
metropolitan buildings. White designed many Long Island residences,
from the house and studio of American academic painter William
Merritt Chase in the Shinnecock Hills of Southampton to the
Versailles-like Harbor Hill in Roslyn (destroyed in 1947). White's
own Long Island home in St. James is a palatially refurbished
farmhouse called Box Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Architecture exhibitions are often frustrating, dependent as
they are on drawings, photographs and text to represent unavailable
buildings, and this one suffers more than most from the genre's
deficits. Its principal merit is to make you want to go see the
buildings. The book accompanying the show, ``The Houses of McKim,
Mead &AMP; White'' by Samuel G. White, Stanford White's great-grandson,
could be a valuable guide for a drive-by tour of the actual
estates.
</P>
<P>
   The most exciting part of the exhibition is an hourlong video,
which has been on television, that breathlessly recalls the
scandalous history of White's affair with the beautiful teen-age
starlet Evelyn Nesbit and his murder by the man she married, the
psychotically jealous Harry Thaw.
</P>
<P>
   Also at Stony Brook is a retrospective of the illustrative
realist paintings of Joseph Reboli, a contemporary Long Islander.
If you go, however, don't miss the carriage museum, which houses a
lavish display of more than 100 antique horse-drawn carriages, many
of which are extraordinary works of Old World craft.
</P>
<P>
   POLLOCK-KRASNER HOUSE: In Southampton and East Hampton, things
are quiet this weekend but promise to become more exciting in the
next few weeks as two museum shows open. For now, the best place to
go in the Hamptons is the Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center,
in the Springs section of East Hampton. There's a small temporary
exhibition of works by Douglass Morse Howell (1906-1994), a
papermaker who supplied fine, handmade sheets to, among others,
Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner, Anne Ryan and Alfonso Ossorio, each
of whom has a piece on Howell paper in the show. Howell's modest
works, made by casting dyed paper, string and other materials into
expressionistic as well as gridded compositions, have an intimate,
delicate sensuality.
</P>
<P>
   But the main attractions at the Pollock-Krasner House are the
small shingled house where Pollock and Krasner lived from 1945
until Pollock's death in 1956 and the studio in one of the
outbuildings, where Pollock created his revolutionary drip
paintings. (Krasner lived here intermittently until she died in
1984.)
</P>
<P>
   If you've never been there before, you're in for a treat. Take
off your shoes, put on a pair of silly, foam-rubber slippers
supplied by the museum and walk around on the splattered floor
where you can still see the ghosts and colors of ``Lavender Mist,''
``Blue Poles'' and other well-known paintings. Around the walls, a
sequence of text panels and photographs by Hans Namuth and Arnold
Newman tells the history of a singular artist and a troubled but
productive marriage. It's amazing to think how the history of art
turned here in this serene place, so far from the tempestuous
cacophony of the Manhattan art world.
</P>
<P>
   GUILD HALL: At Guild Hall in the Village of East Hampton a solo
show of paintings by Julian Schnabel, another denizen of the
Hamptons, will open on Aug. 8. For better or worse, the grandiose
Neo-Expressionist rarely fails to give people something to talk
about. Meanwhile, a crowded exhibition of works by artists who have
lived or vacationed locally remains up through July 26.
</P>
<P>
   Mined from the museum's permanent collection, the show is deep
in inconsequential prints, but it is also studded with gems,
including lush landscapes by the 19th-century painters Thomas Moran
and George Inness; a small, glowing all-over abstraction by
Krasner; a rich green, nearly abstract painting of a sun-dappled
tree by Fairfield Porter, and Henri Cartier-Bresson's 1968
photograph of a car rushing past an old East Hampton graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   PARRISH MUSEUM OF ART: Celebrating its centennial, the Parrish,
in the Village of Southampton, will present ``Dreams for the Next
Century,'' selections from its collection of artists who have lived
in the area. With Klaus Kertess as curator, the show opens on
Sunday and concentrates on the recently deceased painters Willem de
Kooning and Roy Lichtenstein. It will also include works by Joan
Mitchell, John Chamberlain, Chuck Close, Robert Gober and others.
</P>
<P>
   Concurrently with that show, the Parrish will present a major
outdoor installation by Barbara Kruger, a seasonal Hamptons
resident, whose canny showmanship and aggressive ideological
approach will surely stir up the town's tony ambiance.

HISTORIC LANDMARK PRESERVATION COULD BE HILLARY CLINTON'S LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 19)   (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ So much of what has been reported about Hillary
Rodham Clinton has dealt with her involvement in the Whitewater
affair and her defense of her embattled husband that it was a
pleasure to witness her efforts last week to preserve America's
historic landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, life as first lady has not been what she must have
envisioned when she left the governor's mansion in Little Rock for
the White House in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the 1992 presidential campaign, she told a
national television audience that she was not the type to stay home
and bake cookies or follow the ``stand-by-your-man'' credo voiced
by Tammy Wynette.
</P>
<P>
   But, ironically, standing by her man in the face of charges that
he has had extramarital affairs and solicited illegal campaign
contributions has become a big part of her life as first lady.
Although many Republicans, for purely partisan reasons, would like
the president to be impeached or forced to resign, many also have
sound reasons for questioning his integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Those reasons transcend Hillary Clinton's assertion that her
husband is simply the victim of a ``right-wing conspiracy.'' Such
hyperbole has tended to diminish the influence of a talented first
lady.
</P>
<P>
   A highly intelligent woman who sought to pattern herself after
Eleanor Roosevelt, she has been unable to play a major public role
in promoting such causes as health care and child welfare.
</P>
<P>
   When, with the president's blessing, she oversaw creation of a
massive but flawed health care plan, her concoction was destroyed
by congressional Republicans and a multi-million dollar drive
headed by insurance and medical interests. When the battle was
over, Hillary Clinton had lost her cause and many supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign against health care was similar to _ and just as
venomous and disingenuous as _ the one launched this year by the
tobacco industry to kill legislation designed to curb smoking among
teen-agers by sharply increasing the tax on cigarettes. It was
equally successful.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton also has had to answer many questions about her
work in the Whitewater matter as a partner in Little Rock's
prestigious Rose Law Firm. She has been summoned to testify before
a federal grand jury and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the first lady has traveled the world at her
husband's side and on her own. Wherever she had gone, she appears
to have made an excellent impression.
</P>
<P>
   But her legacy has not been a strong one.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that will change as she continues her journeys to save
America's treasures for future generations. Like her husband,
Hillary Clinton has her eye on the millennium and her determination
to honor the past while celebrating the future.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve that goal, she has drawn attention to the need to
preserve the Star Spangled Banner that inspired Francis Scott Key
during the British shelling of Baltimore's Fort McHenry in 1814 to
write the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Baltimore and Washington's Smithsonian Institution,
where the tattered flag is being restored, she has visited Thomas
A. Edison's historic invention factory in West Orange, N.J., and
the homes of James and Dolley Madison in Virginia, famed American
novelist Edith Wharton in Massachusetts and civil rights pioneer
Harriet Tubman in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In Seneca Falls, N.Y., last Thursday she challenged the nation
to ``finish the work begun here'' on behalf of women's rights 150
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At each stop, she stressed the need to protect America's
illustrious past. She plans to extend her focus across the United
States, spotlighting the need for historic preservation in various
sectors of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Before Eleanor Roosevelt strode onto the national stage in the
1930s, presidents' wives were bound by rather strict rules of
decorum. Unless they were involved with such organizations as the
Girl Scouts or the Daughters of the American Revolution, they
played no role in public life and did not travel about on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   But things began to change. Bess Truman and Mamie Eisenhower
were the last of the traditional first ladies.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s Jacqueline Kennedy redecorated the White House with
many original furnishings. Lady Bird Johnson sought to beautify the
nation by keeping junk yards and billboards off many major highways
and by enlivening the landscape with an abundance of wildflowers.
She also promoted Operation Head Start and other Great Society
programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Johnson's basic view was that the president's wife
should create in the White House an ``island of peace'' for the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Nixon was a more retiring first lady, but she made many
friends traveling abroad with her husband and promoting
volunteerism at home.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the White House in 1977, Betty Ford overcame her
dependence on alcohol and then established the clinic that bears
her name and that has helped thousands of individuals overcome
chemical dependency.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalynn Carter's most important mission was to get federal
funds for mental health. She also was a strong advocate of the
Equal Rights Amendment, which ultimately failed.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Reagan exerted powerful influence behind the scenes in the
White House, but her most memorable, and most criticized, public
project was urging young people to ``just say no'' to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bush, an extremely popular first lady, concentrated on
literacy, Head Start and programs for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The president's wife, no matter who she is, can be a valuable
asset to the nation as a persuader and achiever. That is what
Hillary Clinton now is seeking to do. Preservation of historic
landmarks could be her most important legacy.

`BOYS IN LOVE 2': A MEDIOCRE MIX OF SHORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at the end of review.)  
 (js)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Easily the most intriguing film in a mostly mediocre collection
of gay-oriented shorts collected under the title ``Boys in Love 2''
is Barry Purves' ``Achilles.'' The 11-minute animated film
re-imagines the history of the Trojan War as revolving around the
star-crossed love of Achilles and his younger soldier and lover,
Patroclus. Although the movie, narrated by Derek Jacobi, is too
abbreviated and jumpy to carry much dramatic weight, the film's
puppet soldiers, who do battle and make love, are elegant
imitations of classical sculpture brought to life.
</P>
<P>
   The other selections in the anthology are mostly one-joke
affairs. Several borrow their gaudy style from the John Waters
school of brash candy-colored camp. In the longest, Joel Moffett's
``My Body,'' a man wakes up after his first homosexual experience
to discover himself in bed with a dead body that looks just like
him. Discovering that he has contracted a rare new disease called
sexually repressed shedding disorder, he desperately searches for a
cure and winds up in a hospital under the care of a doctor who
preaches the advantages of leading a repressed double life. This
belabored fable about sexual shame and the difficulty of
self-acceptance is directed and performed in an incongruously cute
comic style that quickly runs out of charm.
</P>
<P>
   In Stewart Main's doomed love story, ``Twilight of the Gods,'' a
Maori warrior and a European soldier meet in the jungle, fight,
then become lovers. Although the film strives for a mythical
resonance, it succeeds only as pretentious soft-core fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   David Briggs' leering horror spoof, ``Karen Black Like Me,''
finds a young man chased around his apartment by an extremely
determined sex toy. In Todd Downing's ``Dirty Baby Does Fire
Island,'' a wide-eyed baby doll washed up on the shore becomes a
Peeping Tom. Patrick McGuinn's ``SPF 2000,'' a science fiction
comedy in which a group of lecherous sunbathers encounter a space
alien, is an inept spoof of Italian sexploitation films of the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The wittiest selection, John Scott Matthews' six-minute film
``Boot Camp,'' is also the shortest. As two men cruise each other
in a leather bar, their flirtation turns into a peppy musical
comedy number that bares the ingenuous romanticism seething behind
the characters' studied macho poses.
</P>

ART REVIEW: EXOTICA IN NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: SUMMER-LONG-ISLAND, SUMMER-HUDSON, SUMMER-CONNECTICUT,
AND SUMMER-RDP)  
(lh) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Manhattanites, and particularly those with underdeveloped
driving skills, an art excursion to New Jersey is a breeze. Many of
the state's museums and galleries are a quick trip by train or bus
from Manhattan. And most of them hop with activity through the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   NEWARK MUSEUM: The Newark Museum, ever adventurous in its
programming, is always a premier attraction. And this year it
greets the travel season in appropriate fashion with a smartly
fashioned think piece of an exhibition devoted entirely to the
despised esthetic category known as ``tourist art.''
</P>
<P>
   Organized by the Heard Museum in Phoenix, Ariz., ``Exotic
Illusions: Art, Romance and the Marketplace'' evolved under
interesting circumstances. A few years ago, the Heard did some
housecleaning and decided to unload a range of items, mostly
African, Oceanic and work from the Americas, that were deemed to be
either knockoffs of traditional objects or entirely modern
inventions. But the curator put in charge of de-accessing, Peter H.
Welsh, had plans of his own. He held onto the unwanted material and
turned it into an extended visual essay, with eye-opening results.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh began with a fundamental premise of post-modern theory,
that ``art'' is a fluid category, changing its meaning depending on
its context and that art objects often have as much to say about
the people who acquire them as about those who make them. The 40
entries he selected, most of them from Africa, illustrate his
point.
</P>
<P>
   With few exceptions, they were made for a foreign market and
shaped by its demands. Some objects adapt existing African forms to
reinforce cultural stereotypes. A reproduction of a classic Kifwebe
mask from Congo, for example, adheres to a traditional tribal model
but distorts its features to create a cartoon emblem of brutish
primitivism. Other facsimiles are scuffed up to suggest antique
origin or ceremonial use, factors much valued by collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Certain images are inventive fictions. Sinuous wooden figures
called shetani are among thousands of stylistically similar
sculptures carved by Makonde artists in Tanzania since the late
1950s. Although credited with supernatural origins, the type was
actually conceived with Western esthetic requirements in mind: each
image is unique, if only in minor details, and each is signed with
the name of an individual carver.
</P>
<P>
   By museum standards, such mass-produced objects are historically
inauthentic and artistically suspect. But Welsh argues for a
different set of criteria for judging their validity. For many of
their buyers, including increasing numbers of Africans, they
provide a tenuous psychological link to a lost way of life, a
nostalgia for an imagined Eden. And sometimes they carry clear and
political messages of life in the present.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the case with a charming toy-size beaded helicopter made
for the tourist trade in 1991 by a woman named Gabigabi Nzama in
South Africa. On the one hand, the little sculpture exemplifies a
century-old tradition of Zulu beadwork. On the other, it is a
knowing symbol of the apartheid era, when surveillance helicopters
were known among blacks as ``eyes of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Exotic Illusions'' also includes a selection of travel
brochures, grade-B jungle movie posters, and a mockup of a suburban
living room furnished with ersatz tribal art, all obvious
illustrations of neo-colonialist appropriation. But in the end
Welsh keeps his argument in more complex terrain, considering
artists and patrons neither simply as victims nor opportunists, but
as interactive partners in sustaining the cultural illusions that
all art, masterpiece or otherwise, traffics in.
</P>
<P>
   ALJIRA: Tucked in an office building just a block away from the
Newark Museum is Aljira, a contemporary art center, with a
one-person show by sculptor Martha Posner, who lives in rural
Pennsylvania. The six striking pieces in the shape of garments are
made of wire and organic materials: a towering kimono-like robe is
covered with raw fleece; a stiff and unwearable cloak is woven from
wild rose cane threaded with brightly colored cloth scraps.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade in which images of clothing have been enlisted as
stand-ins for the human body, Ms. Posner's work has a lot of
competition, but by drawing nature into the equation, she gives the
metaphor an evocative spin.
</P>
<P>
   ROBESON CENTER ART GALLERY: Nature also infuses a series of 18
recent paintings by Gregory Amenoff at the Robeson Center Art
Gallery on the Newark campus of Rutgers University. Although their
titles are drawn from the poetry of William Blake, they partake
stylistically of a time-honored strain of American visionary art,
particularly the palpitating animism of Albert Pinkham Ryder and
Charles Burchfield. Amenoff's abstraction has always hovered just
this side of landscapes painting; here he passes, at Romantic
full-throttle, across the line.
</P>
<P>
   MASON GROSS GALLERY: In New Brunswick, a half-hour train ride
from Newark, a very different solo show can be found at the Mason
Gross School of the Arts Gallery near the main campus of Rutgers
University. Sponsored by the University's Center for Latino Arts
and Culture, it includes 30 large-scale paintings by Noe Hernandez,
32, a self-taught, Mexican-born artist.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's mix of Roman Catholic, pre-Columbian and populist
references harkens back to the muralists of an earlier day, though
his predominant subject is immigration rather than revolution. In
one composite image, the Virgin of Guadalupe appears as the Statue
of Liberty floating against a barbed-wire fence at the U.S.-Mexican
border; in another Jesus' face appears on a resident-alien card.
Hernandez's didacticism can be heavy-handed, but he has a firm
command of scale _ one can easily see this work as public art _ and
his collage-style splicing of images is often provocative.
</P>
<P>
   The same gallery is host to ``Puerto Rican Graphic Arts From the
Island to El Barrio/Spanish Harlem: 1950 to 1985.'' The 65 works
document the output of artists in the Caribbean and the United
States, with an emphasis on those who settled in the largely Latino
neighborhood on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Many of those artists
_ Marcos Dimas, Antonio Martorell and Fernando Salicrup among them
_ are still vital members of that community, and their work has
real graphic verve. Photographs of the Barrio two decades ago by
Hiram Maristany are an added delight.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   VOORHEES ZIMMERLI MUSEUM: At the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art
Museum, also on the Rutgers campus in New Brunswick, ``Paul
Robeson: Artist and Citizen'' is worth a look.
</P>
<P>
   This examination of the life of the protean American actor and
singer, who was a Rutgers graduate, consists primarily of archival
papers and artifacts. But there is a selection of portraits by
Winold Reiss, Charles White, Jacob Epstein and Edward Steichen, a
not-unimpressive lot, whose work distills the feeling of American
life at mid-century when Robeson's career was at its peak. The
exhibition will travel to the Museum of the City of New York next
year.
</P>
<P>
   MONTCLAIR ART MUSEUM: Redolent of a still earlier era is the
work of Boston-born Impressionist Maurice Prendergast (1858-1924)
at the Montclair Art Museum in a traveling exhibition, ``Maurice
Prendergast, the State of the Estate: Selections From the Williams
College Museum of Art.'' The 50 or so small paintings and
watercolors were found in the artist's studio at his death and were
eventually given to the college.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of the show is that this material represents the
``private'' Prendergast: works to which he was personally attached
or never finished or was unable to sell. Among them are journeyman
academic portraits, allegorical tableaus and an oversupply of beach
scenes. With his incremental, picture-puzzle technique, Prendergast
could be an attractive artist: his unfinished watercolors, in which
half-formed images and detached swatches of paint float out on a
white ground, look good. But overall he doesn't generate much
excitement here.
</P>
<P>
   More interesting is ``Collecting Culture: Grace Nicholson,'' a
selection from the museum's celebrated American Indian holdings
organized by Twig Johnson that constitutes another exploration of
the dynamics of art-making and patronage. Grace Nicholson
(1877-1948) was a dealer who, indirectly through the collector she
served, supplied a wealth of material to Montclair, and superb
examples of her choice finds are on view.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson's standards for ``museum-quality'' art were stiff. She
considered age, indigenous use and formal beauty as essential
ingredients, and as early as 1912 she reported that: ``All Pueblo
and Hopi material is scarce. They offered to make up a lot of
material for me but I did not care for any of that sort of stuff.''
By 1927 she gave up dealing in American Indian work altogether,
stating that all the ``good'' and ``genuine'' art was gone and
``there is no danger of a revival.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson's perspective itself qualifies, of course, as an
exotic illusion, but fortunately it was one she wasn't locked into
it. For years she supported the careers of living artists like the
great Karok basket makers Elizabeth and Louise Hickox of
California, who produced work for Western travelers during the
craze for American Indian basketry that swept the country early in
the century.
</P>
<P>
   One of Elizabeth's baskets, incorporating maidenhair fern stems
in its weave, is in the show. A more exquisite example of
``tourist'' art, past or present, is impossible to imagine. And
it's nice to know that a century from now, work by artists of our
own day _ differently but equally inspired _ will be appearing in
exhibitions just like this summer offering at Montclair.

 &HT;    ELDERLY CYBERSURFERS CLICKING ONTO INTERNET
 &HT;    560&AMP;add. With INTERNET-DATA
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ E-mail is a great way to keep up with the
grandkids, but that's just one benefit senior cybersurfers are
discovering as they venture on line in growing numbers, experts
told a Senate committee Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are currently faced with two world-wide revolutions _ the
convergence of aging or longevity and the explosion in technology _
both of which are driving the transformation of society,''
explained Craig Spiezle, Microsoft's director of market
development. ``People over the age of 60 represent the
fastest-growing segment of computer and Internet users.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, retirement communities will find that fast
cable modem connections to the Internet are as important as nearby
golf courses in attracting elderly residents, predicted Mary
Furlong, chairman of ThirdAge Media, an online business providing
information to older Americans and the companies trying to reach
them.
</P>
<P>
   The forecasts of an expanding elderly population that is rapidly
becoming cyber-saavy came at a Senate Special Committee on Aging
symposium on ``Older Americans and the World Wide Web: The New Wave
of Internet Users.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a variety of reasons, many of us view the Internet and
other forms of technology as tools of the young,'' said Sen.
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, the committee chairman. ``Although young
people are often the first to use new forms of technology, it often
benefits older people just as much or even more.''
</P>
<P>
   While the elderly are going on line at a faster rate than other
age groups, they still make up only a small portion of the wired
community. Only about 5 percent of senior households own and
actively use a home computer, compared to about 45 percent of
households over all, said Spiezle.
</P>
<P>
   But those demographics will change quickly in an aging global
population. ``Every week, worldwide, 1 million people turn 60. In
the United States alone, 10,000 people turn 50 every day,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of these trends, Microsoft is looking to the elderly to
provide not only customers for its software but also for future
employees in an era where there is already a shortage of high-tech
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view mature Americans as a key solution to this skills
gap'' and have begun programs ``to tap the wealth of experience
seniors bring to the workplace and to help them develop and
cultivate their technological skills,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Older people are not the technophobes or cyber-klutzes that they
are often portrayed to be, said Herbert Ernst, a retired government
computer scientist who trains his contemporaries at a SeniorNet
learning center in suburban Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jewish Council for the Aging center, he said, ``most of
us e-mail our family and friends almost daily; many are members of
on-line groups ...and a colleague of mine asks, 'How did we ever
get along without it?.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the elderly quickly find the Internet to be
indispensible, said Micki Gordon, director of the Center for
Productive Aging. She said they use e-mail to communicate with
family and friends, chat rooms to exchange information with others
who have similar interests, games such as Solitaire to keep their
minds engaged, Web sites to find information on Social Security,
health care, investments and genealogy, and media links for keeping
up with news and gossip.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Logging onto the Internet ``prevents isolation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many elderly Americans are going to their community libraries
for computer training and for an on-line connection, said Jeanne
Hurley Simon, chairperson of the National Commission on Libraries
and Information Science. About 73 percent of the nation's 15,718
libraries provide public access to the Internet, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some communities have created ``cybermobiles'' _ similar to the
familiar bookmobiles utfitted with computer workstations with
Internet links. When the cybermobiles roll out to introduce
homebound senior citizens to the Internet, she said, ``it provides
a whole new meaning to the term ``Information Highway.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the elderly do get hooked into the Internet, they log on
more often and surf longer than other users _ perhaps because they
have more time, said Furlong.
</P>
<P>
   Spiezle said Microsoft is working with the American Association
of Retired Persons (AARP), the National Council on Aging and other
organizations to introduce older Americans to the Internet and give
them the needed technological training. About 35 million households
of people over the age of 60 don't have a home computer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than two-thirds of the group without PCs says they simply
don't see the need,'' Spiezle said. ``But this attitude almost
always changes with the recognition that such technology presents
the opportunity to be employed in a good-paying job, extend one's
independence and allow individuals to remain productive and
creative.''

176 pages of haute-runway literature. You would, however, be
mistaken, insisted McInerney, who said that fashion is simply one
strand of his new novel, ``Model Behavior,'' which chronicles the
unraveling relationship of a fashion magazine journalist and his
size 6 girlfriend who is gainfully employed as a model in the New
York hothouse of fashion, where appearance is destiny and
``breathless enthusiasm sings harmony with toxic ennui.'' By Doreen
Carvajal.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the better ways to understand your chosen
field is through the eyes and ears of those outside it. ``As
Thousands Cheer,'' the musical by Moss Hart and Irving Berlin that
just closed after a succesful resuscitation by the Drama Dept., had
something to tell us about the early-music movement. The audience I
shared it with not long ago helped explain why the operatic voice
is such a hard sell to so many smart young listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Well received on Broadway in 1933 and reborn this summer at the
Greenwich House Theater, the new ``As Thousands Cheer'' was
brightly cast in this revival, rehearsed to a fine point and as
clear as it could have been.
</P>
<P>
   The house was small and welcoming to Hart's texts: no
amplification needed. This was a cut-down version of a show that
originally had more dancing and more things to look at; several
numbers were inserted and taken out as well. Yet a dogged spirit of
fidelity to Berlin's music and Hart's words prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   The joys were archaeological, a kind of Egyptology transferred
to Manhattan. If you had studied the age and the musical culture,
you would have been pleased by it. But for a bright young American
who goes to the theater expecting relevance to a life currently
being led, it was a beautiful job of embalming.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Thousands Cheer'' reminded me of a Baroque opera revival,
one so faithful to period singing styles and dramatic conventions
(excepting the piano that replaced Berlin's pit band) that new and
inquiring audiences were at a disadvantage. There is nothing wrong
with this kind of clubbiness. Indeed, the Drama Dept. seemed to be
aiming at a special listener, either old enough to remember or deep
into the history of American musical theater and Depression-era
history. The restricted seating capacity made this tiny theater the
perfect clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Thousands Cheer'' and I are the same age, so I was
reasonably aware of the news events it commented on. But even for
older people the bite of immediacy disappears. My companion that
night was smart and well-read, but skits about the Rockefellers,
Hoover, Gandhi and vast unemployment _ humor that, to judge by
reviews, amused audiences back then _ left this person largely
baffled. Think of David Letterman opening his show with one-liners
about a WPA project or Henry Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of cabaret performers from a Mabel Mercer
Foundation concert at Town Hall fresh in my ears, it was also
fascinating to hear how different all these singers sounded from
one another. Opera singers sound different, too. If they didn't,
record companies would go out of business and a fervent army of
voice lovers would have to surrender their contentious evenings of
debate and take up bowling.
</P>
<P>
   But in opera there are standards of beauty, a general target
that moves glacially if at all. Although teachers have a thousand
methods for breath support, there is still in opera's collective
unconscious a good idea of what the perfect tenor sounds like.
Discounting the occasional quasi-operatic sound, my cabaret and
theater voices each had a private agenda. Every technique seemed to
constitute its own school of singing.
</P>
<P>
   The great opera sound is triumphant; it advertises victory over
all the glitches that can do the run-of-the-mill singer in. Popular
voices exploit their imperfections. Faintness of tone, rasping
color and strained breathiness evoke vulnerability. The listener _
not threatened by overpowering mastery, longing for human contact
and recalling that the meek shall inherit the earth _ buys into
their weaknesses. It is a device opera uses sparingly, in the
tenorial sob or the casting of ravaged voices in appropriate
character roles.
</P>
<P>
   The operatic voice is a collection of conventions arrived at in
the past, and its fans become amateur historians by necessity.
History becomes a kind of middleman, an intermediary to be
laboriously dickered with. Anyone who loves ``Parsifal'' or
``Carmen'' knows that the labor is worth it, but all must
acknowledge that things are lost: art at the speed of light, the
suddenness of experience unimpeded by the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   We may be wrong when we call bright young listeners who refuse
to have a long-dead set of musical values imposed on them
uncultured and ignorant. Indeed, we might pay more attention to
their world. You cannot, of course, appreciate the play ``Art''
without knowing, at the least, that esthetic squabbles over modern
painting exist.
</P>
<P>
   But understanding opera voices or an Irving Berlin musical
requires more: namely, a hard-working desire to absorb and accept
the long-past worlds that created them.
</P>
<P>
   So if a younger generation says that it has better things to do
with its mind and heart, a lot of us are sorry, but how can we
argue? And if this generation is short on tradition, remember that
tradition has not fared well in our century.
</P>
<P>
   Take geopolitics, where young countries with brief pasts benefit
from traveling light, and old countries previously empowered by
their histories feel the burdens of old habits in a quick-change
world. On one hand, there is the United States, suffering from a
lack of inherited culture but accomplishing wonders through
flexibility. Then there are the people of the Balkans, whose spirit
is paralyzed to this day by a battle fought with the Turks at
Kosovo in 1389.
</P>
<P>
   There is no use asking which direction is better: the direct
artistic experience or the negotiated one, current events or dead
ones. You can love the operatic voice while understanding why lots
of intelligent people do not. I hope you enjoyed ``As Thousands
Cheer'' for its archaeological revelations. They were many. Still,
I don't advise calling this living theater. It's as dead as a
doornail.

<HEADLINE>
`ZORRO' IS A GRAND OLD SWASHBUCKLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFF SHANNON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The creators of ``The Mask of Zorro'' wanted to reintroduce the
fabled hero to young '90s audiences with an operatic flair, so
they've beefed up the masked avenger's legacy with enough tragedy,
treachery and hard-earned redemption to make it as ripe as anything
Verdi ever staged.
</P>
<P>
   It's a vigorous crowd pleaser that gradually betrays its own
noble ambitions, but it's also got enough gusto and agility to
qualify as a satisfying swashbuckler in the grand old style.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Fairbanks was a better swordsman than either Anthony
Hopkins or Antonio Banderas, who play Zorro here as a
master-student combo, with Don Diego de la Vega (Hopkins) passing
the torch after serving served 20 years of an unjust prison
sentence. But Fairbanks would surely approve of this dual effort of
charismatic stars, and the sly combination of Hopkins' gravity and
Banderas's seductive insouciance.
</P>
<P>
   Top it off with parallel subplots of vengeance and you've got
familial honor of ``Godfather'' proportions, albeit with old-world
etiquette and more witty joie de vivre.
</P>
<P>
   Don Diego was jailed by Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson), the Spanish
governor of Alta California, in a confrontation that cost the life
of Diego's beloved wife (Julietta Rosen) and possession of his
infant daughter Elena, who was raised by Rafael with no knowledge
of her real father's fate. Two decades later, Mexican bandit
Alejandro Murieta (Banderas) suffers a similar loss to Rafael's
ironically-named military henchman Capt. Love (Matt Letscher), who
yearns for the now stunningly beautiful Elena (Catherine
Zeta-Jones).
</P>
<P>
   Having passed his time in the heroic spotlight, Diego grooms
Murieta to be the new Zorro, joining forces to combat Rafael's plot
to exploit Mexicans in his quest to purchase California from Spain.
</P>
<P>
   You can easily figure out the rest of the scenario, which
escalates into a zesty display of swordplay, clever maneuvering and
an explosive free-the-slaves climax. ``The Mask of Zorro'' is more
effective in set-up than payoff, and after piling on its subplots
it gradually gives way to the kind of mayhem that director Martin
Campbell handles so well in his 007 blockbuster ``GoldenEye.''
</P>
<P>
   No telling what young maverick Robert Rodriguez would have done
with the movie; he bailed over contract disputes two months before
cameras rolled. But Cambell seems more in line with the lavish,
glossy vision of Steven Spielberg, who fostered the project and was
once intending to direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mask of Zorro'' has just enough sophistication to satisfy
adults (and a script good enough to attract this stellar cast), but
like ``Braveheart' and ``Rob Roy,'' it's an action-drama with youth
appeal and some indulgent concessions to a mainstream audience.
</P>
<P>
   Even at 136 minutes, the story takes some conspicuous shortcuts
(as when Banderas goes from crude rogue to diplomatic ``gentleman''
virtually overnight) and, after all its dashing fancy, it falls
back on a rousing but routine action finale.
</P>
<P>
   And Zeta-Jones, despite the intelligence and grit of her
character, is basically the target of Banderas's sexy (and
occasionally sexist) humor. It's all delightfully good-natured, but
the now-familiar gag (in which Zorro precisely slices Elena's
night-dress off with his sword) tells you where the movie's (and
Zorro's) priorities lie.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part it's good. It could have been better.
</P>
<P>
   The Mask of Zorro. Directed by Martin Campbell. Screenplay by
John Eskow and Ted Elliott &AMP; Terry Rossio. Cast: Anthony Hopkins,
Antonio Banderas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stuart Wilson, Matt
Letscher. Tri-Star Pictures. 136 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence,

ODD `BUFFALO 66 MIXES FANTASY AND REALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Buffalo 66'' is named after the Buffalo Bills football team
and the year in which the story's hero was born.
</P>
<P>
   Written by actor Vincent Gallo, who also directs and stars, the
film is about Billy Brown (Gallo), a poor schlub who harbors a
grudge against former Bills' place kicker Scott Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Billy believes Woods wrecked his life by throwing a big game,
causing him to lose a fortune to the local hoods. The only way he
can repay the debt is to take the fall for one of the gang's thugs,
and he goes to prison for a crime he never committed. After Billy
is let out of jail, he returns home to Buffalo to even the score
against those who wrecked his life and his big chance at being the
best bowler in town.
</P>
<P>
   The film features a tender supporting performance by Christina
Ricci as Layla, the young tap dance student Billy clumsily kidnaps
to act as his wife on his homecoming visit to his negligent
parents, played with a scary ferocity and humor by Ben Gazzara and
Anjelica Huston.
</P>
<P>
   Billy's folks embrace Layla as the daughter they never had,
pouring her a glass of wine, stuffing her full of tripe stew, and
telling her they love her. But they ignore Billy, looking at their
son as if he were a stranger, and indeed, he's lied to them for
five years, telling them he's been on a covert mission for the CIA
instead of wasting away in a prison cell.
</P>
<P>
   This odd film _ which won raves at Sundance and played the
recent Seattle International Film Festival _ is full of surprises,
some good, some not so believeable.
</P>
<P>
   It's sadly funny as well as whimsical in spite of its backdrop
of potentially abrasive _ and highly abusive _ situations. It's a
strange mix of gritty realism and fantasy stirred together into an
unusual love story that thankfully only flirts, and then flees,
from violence. It's about missed opportunity, shattered dreams and
trying to make a mark in a world that barely knows you're alive.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo, who has played the loser role before in a number of indie
movies like ``Palookaville,'' is surprisingly endearing as Billy,
especially since the character is so critical and judgmental of
others.
</P>
<P>
   Writer/director Gallo's intentions are clearly noble in this
offbeat romance about loving in spite of past scars, but he can't
fully pull his ambitious subtext from beneath the quirkiness. In
the end, ``Buffalo 66'' parallels Billy's story by not fulfilling
its potential.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo 66. Directed and written by Vincent Gallo. Cast: Gallo,
Christina Ricci, Anjelica Huston, Ben Gazzara. Lions Gate Films.
110 minutes. Rated R for nudity, language, violence.

`LAWN DOGS' IS YET ANOTHER ATTACK ON SHALLOW SUBURBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Australia's John Duigan continually shows himself to be a
director capable of great highs and great lows, of films as
excellent as ``Sirens'' and ``Flirting'' and as pedestrian as ``The
Journey of August King'' and ``Wide Sargasso Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, his latest effort, ``Lawn Dogs,'' which debuted
at the Seattle International Film Festival, is very much at the low
end of his career chart _ indeed, is likely to be regarded as its
all-time nadir.
</P>
<P>
   The film is the movies' umpteenth attack on the shallowness of
suburbia, as seen through the eyes of a 10-year-old girl (Mischa
Barton) who has what may be the most cardboardishly venal and
hypocritical parents ever be portrayed in a major motion picture.
</P>
<P>
   She forms a forbidden friendship with a 21-year-old gardener and
white-trash outcast (Sam Rockwell), who takes care of the lawns of
the middle class scum who populate the closed-off Kentucky
suburburban community. Together, they become martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawn Dogs'' has some visually stylish flourishes and moves _
granted _ to a riveting ending. But the journey there is grueling
and totally unnecessary. Surely there can't be anyone left in the
world who hasn't already learned from the movies that the American
suburb is the habitation of soulless monsters.
</P>
<P>
   Duigan's deliberately broad tone comes off as oafish and
heavy-handed, his satire continually misses its mark, his child
lead is charming but a noticeably bad actress. Worse, his film
seems to positively relish its mean-spirited violence and its
endless urine and burping jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Can this possibly be the work of the same John Duigan who could
make a film as poignant and intelligent as ``Romero'' and a
romantic comedy as sophtisicated and witty as last March's ``The
Leading Man?'' Nawhh, that must be a different John Duigan.
</P>
<P>
   Lawn Dogs. Directed by John Duigan. Written by Naomi Wallace.
Cast: Mischa Barton, Sam Rockwell, Kathleen Quinlan, Christopher
McDonald. Strand Releasing. 101 minutes. Rated R for violence.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, Md. _ A dozen skaters wearing simple black practice
clothes are gliding with precision and concentration up and down a
suburban Maryland ice rink. For a while they move in groups of
four. Then their leader, a boyish, mild-mannered but intensely
focused young man, demonstrates an intricate sequence including
several shifts of balance and an elegant spiral. The skaters soon
follow suit, performing the moves one by one under his watchful
eye.
</P>
<P>
   As the July sun blazes outside, members of Next Ice Age are
completing their daily class, which precedes a day of rehearsals
for their American Dance Festival debut on Thursday in Durham, N.C.
The 10-year-old ensemble-skating company, founded by Nathan Birch,
35, who taught the class, and Tim Murphy, 39, will take an
important step at Durham. It will be performing in a modern-dance
context.
</P>
<P>
   The program will consist of five works. Three are by Birch _ the
world premieres of ``Syllabice'' and ``Starr-Struck'' and a 1991
solo, ``Breezeway''; and two are by Murphy _ ``Machines,'' his
earliest work for the company, and ``Bright Blue Skating,'' from
last year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The two men's goal has been to create an alternative type of
repertory dance company with its own discipline and technique, an
enterprise closer in spirit to the Durham festival than to the
flashy touring productions presented in ice arenas.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Birch and Murphy fervently believe in figure skating as a form
of dance, a belief that reflects their heritage as original members
of the John Curry Skating Company in the 1980s. That short-lived
but highly praised and influential venture staked a claim for
skating as a significant artistic endeavor. Training his skaters
through the detailed, intricate classes he developed, and
commissioning major choreographers to create ice dances, Curry (the
1976 Olympic gold medalist who died of AIDS in 1994)
single-handedly altered the perception of skating and enhanced its
validity as a performing art suitable for the proscenium stage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us knew at the very beginning of his company that there
was one light shining in the skating world, and he was it, that he
could really open doors for us,'' says Murphy, who before working
with Curry had been ready to abandon skating, demoralized after
nine months of playing a ``big yellow chicken'' in the Ice Follies.
``He really made me believe that anything is possible.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Curry's intention, even during his successful competitive
career, had always been to bring skating into the dance world. And
through Curry, skaters like Birch and Murphy found a new way to
apply and extend their skills after their competitive years were
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were skating at the Metropolitan Opera House and Kennedy
Center, working with choreographers like Lar Lubovitch and Laura
Dean,'' recalls Birch, who was 20 when he hooked up with Curry.
``Life was pretty great.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An integral element of Curry's vision was the classes he
developed. They functioned as the equivalent of the George
Balanchine classes that had helped mold the New York City Ballet's
dancers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trained in a very specific way, very similar to the class
we do here,'' Birch says. ``For two hours we wouldn't spin or jump.
We would just do edge work, concentrating intensely on body line
and position. John would talk a lot about where the blade and the
ice meet, where the weight of your foot is and how your foot sits
in the boot. And he taught us through his own example, because he
was the most extraordinary skater ever.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite its artistic success, Curry's company encountered legal
and managerial problems and disbanded abruptly in 1985. ``At the
time, there was no other company on the same wavelength, so all of
us were forced to move on with our lives,'' Birch recalls. ``I
tried teaching. I did some solo performances and some touring shows
that weren't artistically satisfying.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 he moved to Baltimore, where Murphy was already living
and teaching. The two men _ childhood friends who had often faced
each other in amateur competition _ decided to pick up where Curry
had left off. ``We started our company out of frustration,'' says
Birch, who is the artistic director and shares choreographic
responsibilities with Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to see the art form continue. There was nothing of
significance to carry on the legacy of what John did. We wanted to
create an environment with the mind-set of an ensemble company,
with really good skaters who checked their egos at the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry helped select the company's name, made guest appearances
and, in 1993, choreographed his final group work for it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although it lacks a home base (it moves around between various
rinks in the Baltimore area) and has yet to establish a regular
season, performing intermittently when and where it can, the Next
Ice Age has managed to build a repertory that confirms the
choreographic possibilities of skating. It has shared the struggles
familiar to other dance companies in the 1990s; Birch's
conversation frequently veers from artistic matters to the
financial and administrative struggles to which he necessarily
devotes much time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A big break came last year when Next Ice Age was invited to
perform for a week on the Kennedy Center Opera House stage,
accompanied by a full orchestra. The program included new works by
Birch and Murphy, a revival of the Curry work and guest appearances
by the former Olympic skater Dorothy Hamill, who has moved to
Baltimore and frequently takes class and performs with the troupe
(and also serves on its board).
</P>
<P>
   The musically sophisticated, richly varied program eloquently
demonstrated how much more there is to explore in skating beyond
four-minute solos and quadruple jumps. There was no shortage of
virtuosity on the stage, but the sweeping, fluent patterns of group
movement inspired as many ovations as the individual feats.
</P>
<P>
   For Birch and Murphy, it was not only a chance to demonstrate
their choreographic maturity and versatility; it was also an
emotional return to a stage on which they had appeared with the
Curry company at the pinnacle of its success. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charles and Stephanie Reinhart, the Kennedy Center's artistic
advisers for dance, took the bold step of presenting Next Ice Age,
installing an ice surface on the vast stage. They were so excited
by the performances that they decided the company deserved to be
part of the 65th-anniversary season of the Durham festival, of
which they are co-directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it's another way of pushing the envelope for what
modern dance has traditionally done, which is break new ground,''
Mrs. Reinhart says. ``It's elegant and imaginative _ and great
dancing. Historically, ADF has had all kinds of performances in all
kinds of venues.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinhart adds, ``I put this in the category of what Elizabeth
Streb and Pilobolus have done; when people first see them they ask,
`Is that dance?'''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The stage of the Reynolds Industries Theater, where Next Ice Age
will perform, is significantly smaller than that of the Kennedy
Center; to the choreographers, this is a challenge rather than a
limitation. ``My hope is that if we can make it work in that size
space,'' says Birch, ``then perhaps our touring options will be
greater. We hope to be presented in dance venues. Putting ice on a
stage is not as scary as it seems.''
</P>
<P>
   Birch's ``Starr-Struck,'' set to recordings by the celebrated
big-band singer Kay Starr, who will be in attendance, was created
for the festival through the Doris Duke Awards for New Work. He
describes it as ``a departure for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm known for making long, heavy, classical pieces,'' he says.
``This one is meant to be fun. Kay Starr's music always puts me in
a great mood, and I wanted to choreograph to it for a long time.
It's our 10th anniversary, and I feel like celebrating a little.''

FEEL FREE TO SPEAK OUT ON PUBLIC ISSUES _ THAT IS, IF YOUR BOSS
APPROVES

c.1998 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suppose you are involved in the anti-abortion movement and you
spend your weekends picketing abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Now, suppose your boss at the XYZ Co. is pro-choice and doesn't
much like your brand of political activism. So he tells you to cut
out your picketing and any other show of support or you'll lose
your job.
</P>
<P>
   What? What about the First Amendment? Can your boss quash your
free speech rights?
</P>
<P>
   In a word, yes. Private employees don't have any free speech
protections, the courts have ruled over and over.
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment refers to protections against government
tyranny of free speech, said Tony Rosenstein, an employment lawyer
for Baker &AMP; Botts in Houston. Employers were not feared tyrants
when the Constitution was written.
</P>
<P>
   The issue recently surfaced in the case involving Edward Blum,
who spent 17 years as a stockbroker for PaineWebber in Houston. He
had been campaigning to abolish affirmative action in Houston _ a
referendum he sponsored on the city ballot was defeated in November
_ and was forced by the brokerage firm to cease all outside
political activity as a condition of employment.
</P>
<P>
   Blum received a reprimand in March telling him that the firm
will not clear any press contacts either on or off the record or
any article in which he espouses an anti-affirmative postition and
that any further violation would result in immediate termination.
The firm requires its employees to clear all interviews and
articles in advance, according to the reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   In his written response, Blum wrote that in the last six to
seven years he's had letters to the editor published in newspapers,
but none of them addressed financial issues relating to the
securities industy, capital markets or investments. Instead, they
dealt with issues such as genetic cloning, racial preferences and
U.S. policy toward Israel, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PaineWebber code of conduct I'm required to sign every
year specifically requires me to clear any investment-related
articles prior to publication,'' he wrote. ``The code does not
address pre-clearance of letters to newspapers, articles, etc.,
that are outside of investment-related topics.``
</P>
<P>
   Blum resigned recently, contending the firm's stipulation to
stop his outside political activities came after a ``very senior
elected offical of the city of Houston'' called the chairman of
PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, PaineWebber said Blum's articles were reflecting
negatively on the firm's reputation and had led to client
complaints and loss of business. After underwriting city bond
offerings for several years, PaineWebber has been passed over
lately for city bond work.
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber was within its rights to tell Blum to stop his
political activity, said Andrew S. Golub, an employment lawyer who
represents individuals. Blum probably doesn't have a case against
the brokerage firm, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He may, however, have a case against the city of Houston for
interfering with his free speech rights by complaining to his
employer, Golub said. That government muzzling of free speech is
what the First Amendment protects.
</P>
<P>
   Free speech is a trickier situation if an employee works for a
government agency.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, public employees have more freedom to
express themselves. A public school teacher, for example, would
have the right to participate in the pro-choice movement on his own
time, Rosenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The situation changes if the government employee complains about
his employer. Then issues of public concern and government interest
determine whether the speech is protected or whether it's just like
a private employer-employee relationship.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a city firefighter complains to the media about
not getting a raise and says the fire chief is a bad guy, it's a
personal issue and wouldn't be protected speech, said Bill Helfand,
a defense lawyer in Houston who concentrates on employment law and
civil rights claims.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a matter of public concern _ and thereby protected _ if
an employee in the police department complains the department is
not keeping track of confiscated drugs and they're lying all around
the basement.
</P>
<P>
   Cases are never clear, Helfand said. They have to be judged
individually.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a delicate balance of weighing government interest
with freedom of speech for public employees. That pops up in
sports, said John Zavitsanos, a Houston lawyer who recently opposed
Helfand on a free speech case.
</P>
<P>
   If a coach works for a state-supported college and complains
about a bad referee at a game, courts have ruled that the school's
interest in muzzling its coach is greater than letting a coach
mouth off, he said.

WHAT WAS LIFE LIKE BEFORE THE INTERNET? 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to believe, but the use of graphical browsers to surf
the World Wide Web is just over 5 years old. Mosaic, the first
software to let users see images on the Web, was originally
released in January 1993.
</P>
<P>
   For those who rely on a connected computer for work and play, it
seems like a lot longer than that.
</P>
<P>
   Can you recall what you did to warm a plate of leftovers before
the microwave? I suspect in just a few more years serious Webheads
may have a hard time remembering what it was like to order flowers
by phone or browse a bookstore in the 3-D world.
</P>
<P>
   Okay, so perhaps I exaggerate. But you get the point _ few
communications media have changed the world as quickly as the Web
... at least for those who use it regularly. And the numbers of
those who do continue to grow rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the Web changes the lives of those who embrace it,
the Web itself is changing.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, just having a Web site was enough to draw
attention. If it rated as a cool site _ whatever that means _ then
so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the number of sites could be measured in the
thousands. It was not unlike the dawn of television, when early
adopters gathered around sets to stare at test patterns. A little
eye candy went a long way.
</P>
<P>
   But with millions of Web pages online, getting and holding
visitors' attention now requires that a site offer something of
value. The Web has gone from being a curiosity to being a seriously
useful tool.
</P>
<P>
   If you use the Web on a daily basis, chances are there are a
handful of sites you return to regularly for a variety of services.
In some cases, they may have supplanted other ways you used to get
the same information.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I no longer call an airline when I want to find out
when a particular flight is arriving. Instead, I visit TheTrip.com
and use its flight tracker at www.thetrip.- &QL; 
com/flightstatus/.
</P>
<P>
   Choose an airline and a flight number, and not only will the
site tell you when the plane is expected, but it will even tell you
how many miles it is from the destination airport.
</P>
<P>
   When I want directions to a particular location, I no longer
look it up on a paper map. Instead, I visit MapQuest at
www.mapquest.com. This is one of several sites that let you enter
starting and destination addresses to get door-to-door directions,
complete with a map.
</P>
<P>
   You do have to be careful with these because the directions
aren't always perfect. If I'm in doubt, I'll double-check MapQuest
against Maps On Us at www.mapsonus.com, a similar service.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm shopping for computer components, I'll try ZDNet's
NetBuyer at www.netbuyer.com, which lets you compare prices at
dozens of different online vendors. Tell the site you want to find
prices on, say, 9-gigabyte and bigger hard drives with an Ultra ATA
interface. You'll get plenty of choices, sorted by manufacturer,
complete with prices.
</P>
<P>
   However, be aware that some of the bigger computer vendors
aren't listed, including CompUSA (www.compusa.com) and Cyberian
Outpost (www.outpost.com).
</P>
<P>
   When I want to check out the weather _ not that there have been
many changes around here from the hot-and-dry forecast lately _ I
don't wait to hear it on radio or TV. Instead, I drop by
Intellicast at www.intellicast.com.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are other weather sites _ including the Weather
Channel's at www.weather.com _ Intellicast is easily the
friendliest and the fastest. Weather sites tend to bog down when
the atmosphere acts up, but Intellicast stays fairly speedy even
when there is lots of weather news.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the single most useful Web site in Houston is the
Real-Time Traffic Map at traffic.tamu.edu/traffic.html. It shows a
map of the city's freeway system, color-coded to indicate freeway
speeds. Click on any colored segment to get the average speed of
traffic on that road. If you're not in Houston, you can get similar
maps for nearly 30 U.S. cities at TrafficNet at
www.accutraffic.com.

REMOVING SOFTWARE'S OLD VERSION LEAVES PROBLEMS FOR THE NEW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I was using McAfee VirusScan 3.14 when I downloaded version
3.16. I noticed in the Add/Remove program of Windows 95 that both
versions were listed. I decided to remove the old version, but when
I did, it removed the shortcut for both versions. Can you not
remove old versions of software or programs in ``Add/-Remove''
without affecting the new version?
</P>
<P>
   A. In theory, that's how it should work. But as is the case with
Windows 95/98, theory and practice are often two different things.
</P>
<P>
   The Add/Remove module in the Control Panel is the simplest _
though not always the best _ way to remove a program from Windows
95/98. Usually, the entries you see in the list point to a removal
program in each software package's folder.
</P>
<P>
   If you install new versions of a program on your system, the
installation process should handle the listing in Add/Remove. But
sometimes, as apparently is the case with VirusScan, it dropped a
duplicate entry into the list.
</P>
<P>
   The uninstall routine for the older version of McAfee searched
your program groups for shortcuts with a specific name. If both
shortcuts have the same name, the uninstall program will remove
both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, even if you have removed a program, Add/Remove will
still show a listing for it. You can remove these phantom listings
using TweakUI, the Windows 95 PowerToy that lets you configure the
Windows desktop. You can get the Windows 95 version at 
www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/contents/PowerToys/W95TweakUI/de
fault.asp. A version of TweakUI for Windows 98 is on the operating
system's upgrade CD, in the Tools/Reskit/Powertoy folder.
</P>
<P>
   And here's the standard disclaimer about removing Windows
programs: You should never just delete a folder to nuke a program.
Always use either Add/Remove or a third-party uninstall program,
such as CleanSweep or Uninstaller.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Last year I bought a computer with an AMD K6 chip, and I
really like it. I'd heard it doesn't play games like Quake very
well, but that's not been my experience. Quake rocks on this thing!
Anyway, now I'm seeing something called the K6-2, and supposedly
it's better for games. What's the difference between the K6 and
K6-2?
</P>
<P>
   A. The K6 is Advanced Micro Devices' answer to the Pentium
family of chips from Intel Corp., though it's significantly less
expensive. This has made PCs that use this chip the favorites of
those who want lots of speed but also want to keep from spending
lots of cash.
</P>
<P>
   However, the K6 doesn't match Intel's Pentium family in one
respect, an area called floating-point calculations. This is a
certain kind of math that's handled by a specific part of the chip.
Games like Quake use floating-point calculations to handle some
aspects of their graphics.
</P>
<P>
   With the K6-2, AMD has added a set of instructions in the chip
called 3DNow!, which can handle a lot of the work done by the
floating-point unit in Pentium chips. And because they are specific
to 3-D graphics, they can in some cases handle it better.
</P>
<P>
   To prove its point, AMD has released a set of drivers and a new
executable for Quake II that works with the 3DNow! instruction set.
I've tried these on a K6-2-based machine running at 300 megahertz,
and the results are indeed spectacular. Quake II is incredibly
fluid.
</P>
<P>
   There's one problem, though. Programs must be tweaked to take
advantage of the K6-2's abilities. Running any old 3-D game on a
K6-2 machine won't yield the kind of results you get with the
specially tuned version of Quake II. As a result, AMD is promoting
the K6-2, hoping to convince software developers to take advantage
of 3DNow!
</P>
<P>
   If you have a machine with a K6-2 chip in it, you can download
the Quake II files at www.amd.com/products/cpg/k623d/drivers.html. &QL;

ART REVIEW: IN THE HUDSON VALLEY, A FEAST WITH A PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: SUMMER-LONG-ISLAND, SUMMER-NEW-JERSEY,
SUMMER-CONNECTICUT, AND SUMMER-RDP)  
(lh) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   People venturing into New York's Hudson Valley in pursuit of
interesting art have their work cut out for them. The summer shows
are diverse, substantial and spread out, forming a feast that
requires no small amount of mobility but is generally worth the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   HUDSON RIVER MUSEUM: Moving north from the city, the first stop
is the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, which is living up to its
name with ``Where Land Meets River,'' a selection of works from its
collection by artists of the Hudson River School, their
contemporaries, followers and fellow travelers. It's a small,
thrown-together affair with only two dozen artworks, and it isn't
helped by its setting, a gallery dominated by a large, ugly
stairwell. Still, the show is close to enchanting, its piecemeal
nature underscoring the pervasive influence of the river on
artistic imaginations of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Start with several images from John Hill's ``Hudson River
Portfolio'' of the early 1820s, whose big, capable aquatints are
based on the watercolors of William Guy Wall. Each image shares its
sheet with descriptive text, like that which identifies ``View Near
Fort Montgomery'' as ``one of those happy groupings of mountain and
water scenery, which, among the windings of the highlands, are so
abundant as to render selection difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   This abundance is reiterated by John Douglas' large,
fastidiously detailed late-19th-century canvas, ``View of the
Hudson (Highlands) With Woman Painting.'' The artist has set up her
easel overlooking a panorama that could yield a lifetime of motifs.
</P>
<P>
   The show is peppered with idiosyncratic works. These include a
large panoramic wash from 1831 looking north from West Point by one
A. Van Zandt that is notable for its delicate textures and muted,
almost Chinese atmosphere; a dramatic folk art painting of a stormy
night on the Hudson, in which waves, clouds and sails all tilt
starchily to the right, fighting the wind, and four decorative
panels made from 1830 to 1840 in which riverside scenes, crisply
stenciled in light paint on dark, have the hallucinatory
ghostliness of afterimages.
</P>
<P>
   Certain vistas clearly attracted artists by the the score. The
Hudson's majestic Palisades loom in several images in tones ranging
from lavender to brown, including another Hill/Wall collaboration
whose accompanying text, citing their ``savage grandeur,'' is
nearly redundant.
</P>
<P>
   A second exhibition, ``Go Figure,'' contains a handful of works
from the museum's collection by George Segal, Rigoberto Torres,
Joseph Cornell, Red Grooms and Paul Manship.
</P>
<P>
   NEUBERGER MUSEUM OF ART: Conveniently, the next stop is the
Neuberger Museum of Art, where a survey of Robert Berlind's
landscapes confirms that the tradition is alive and well, and that
water continues to cast its spell. Berlind, who turns 60 this year
(and who has a show of recent work at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery on
Fifth Avenue through July 24), prefers to view water close up, in
puddles and ponds that capture, animate and distort reflections of
trees, sky and river banks. It is a vantage point that brings out
the abstract side of nature while creating a contemplative,
slightly melancholy air.
</P>
<P>
   Representing 14 years of work with roughly 30 paintings and oil
sketches, this exhibition traces a growing artistic command and
emotional complexity. Some early paintings settle tensions that are
largely narrative. ``Field'' a dark lawn illuminated by light from
a barely visible house might almost be a crime scene. Occasionally,
there's a rather coarse decorative buzz, as in ``Winter Vineyard,''
where twisted grape trees dance against the stark whiteness of
snow; a conventional realism, generic and dull, characterizes
industrial images like ``Saw Kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlind began to hit his stride in the early 1990s with a series
of desolate, tree-strewn images in black and white titled ``Damaged
Woods'' that experiment with a more painterly approach. In
subsequent works he turns to trees reflected in water or seen
against empty skies. The drama of his art emanates increasingly
from the paint itself, from the play between depicted and real
light and from the fluidity of both paint and water. The sense of
the artist's hand, mind and eye increases, evoking, oddly, both
Willem de Kooning and John Singer Sargent. But Berlind anchors his
increasingly bravura style in reality, where it is leavened by a
palpable sense of nature's power and inevitability.
</P>
<P>
   Other shows at the Neuberger include a small survey of recent
paintings, most notably ``Glass Houses,'' in which Maura Sheehan,
Ming Hu and Thermon Statom have used various kind of glass to
create handsome installations. An installation work by Nancy
Davidson is also on view.
</P>
<P>
   KATONAH MUSEUM OF ART: ``Pavel Tchelitchew: Landscape of the
Body,''at the Katonah Museum of Art, is the first retrospective in
more than 30 years devoted to the eccentric Russian-born Surrealist
whose star burned brightly in New York, London and Paris in the
late 1930s and '40s. He designed sets for George Balanchine; did
portraits of Dame Edith Sitwell, Lincoln Kirstein and Gertrude
Stein, all of whom admired his work profoundly; drew covers for
View magazine, whose founder, Charles Henri Ford, was his
companion, and was often seen as the rival and equal of Jackson
Pollock.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time he died in Rome in 1957, Tchelitchew's
achievement had faded in the light of Abstract Expressionism's
blazing rise. He became known for exactly one painting:
``Hide-and-Seek,'' the phantasmagoric fusion of child's play,
tree-of-life and truncated body that is among the Museum of Modern
Art's most popular paintings. The exhibition includes this work and
an even more extravagant tour de force, ``Phenomenon,'' an
apocalyptic freak show painting from the late 1930s on loan from
the State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative, mystical, preternaturally gifted as a draftsman,
Tchelitchew was born in Russia in 1898 to a wealthy privileged
existence that ended with the Russian revolution, which scattered
his family in exile. His life closely parallels that of Vladimir
Nabokov, who was one year his junior, and an extravagant refinement
inhabits the one's line and the other's language. But beneath
Tchelitchew's crystalline refinement, an element of indulgence and
delusion tinges most of his work.
</P>
<P>
   This exhibition traces a trajectory of considerable momentum, by
turn fascinating, beautiful and pandering, and frequently overly
indebted to Picasso and Dali. The artist's ink drawings and
notebooks, which alternate between spontaneous sketches and
meticulous preparations for larger works, show his talent at its
freshest and most immediate. And his late abstractions _ their
luminous circuitries distilling the veins and nerves that
electrified his transparent skulls and bodies, turn calculated
refinement into the genuinely visionary. Dating from the last four
years of Tchelitchew's life, these networks may have been spurred
by Pollock's example, but their fibrillating intensity is all their
own.

<P>
   STORM KING ART CENTER: ``The Fields of David Smith,'' at the
Storm King Art Center in Mountainville, just west of the Hudson, is
the second of three surveys of the American sculptor's career being
held during successive summers. It displays nearly two dozen
examples of Smith's often implicitly figurative work outdoors,
where they are forced to compete with gentle mountain views. An
additional 30 sculptures and reliefs, as well as drawings and
photographs, are being shown in the large renovated stone house
that contains the center's galleries. Basically this is another
David Smith show that, despite its pleasures, is rudimentary and
does little more than underscore the need for a large, definitive
examination of the artist's work.
</P>
<P>
   Variously planar or linear, touchingly humorous or offensive in
reference (consider the reclining forms of ``The Lady Painter''),
physically audacious or simply clumsy, Smith's art is complex and
uneven. Unlike the Abstract Expressionist painters, who tended to
distill their visions into a single style or motif, his forms and
styles continued to multiply and divide until his death in 1965.
And while the painters tended to pass through Cubist or Surrealist
phases, Smith's work retained signs of these influences throughout,
remixing and reconsidering their possibilities, so that his work
has a peculiar suspefsion.
</P>
<P>
   It can be seen as bringing to conclusion many of the most
important sculptural ideas of the first half of the 20th century
and also as inaugurating a more abstract and experiential phase of
sculpture. Smith translated the improvisational freshness of
``action painting,'' as Abstract Ex`ressionism was sometimes
called, into three dimensions; he demonstrated how sculpture, like
painting, can be made up as it goes along. His best works make us
aware of the physical decisions and compositional elements involved
in their unity, of the artist's hand, impetuosity and eye for
detail and accident.
</P>
<P>
   But his work doesn't decisively point sculpture in the direction
of environmental art, which was the achievement of various Pop,
Minimal and Post-Minimal artists, prominently Claes Oldenburg,
Donald Judd and Richard Serra.
</P>
<P>
   The show makes much of this clear, but the information is
virtually unorganized, with the presentation of works outdoors in
jumbled disarray being especially unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of Smith's penchant for displaying his work
in the fields around his studio at Bolton's Landing, N.Y. a few
miles up the river, but here, at least, the idea seems overrated.
With works from the Voltri series; stainless steel pieces like ``XI
Books, III Apples'' ``Sentinel V'' and ``Untitled (Candida)'' and
sundry other works, including the powerful, white forms of ``Primo
Piano III,'' one's time outdoors is hardly wasted. Still, the works
are seen to much better advantage in the galleries, where their
often delicate structures, psychological currents and historical
references can be more fully savored and neither their strengths
nor their weaknesses are muffled by the natural setting.
</P>
<P>
   VASSAR COLLEGE: The tour rounds out with two very different but
rewarding group shows. ``Acquisitions on Paper: 1988-1998,'' at the
Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College sounds modest: it
is a selection of drawings, prints and photographs acquired by the
college during the last decade that have not yet been exhibited.
But the 50 works on view include some marvelous things: prints by
Schongauer, Cezanne, Munch and Alexander Calder; drawings by
Gauguin, Tchelitchew and Abraham Jansz van Diepenbeeck, the
17th-century Flemish painter whose ``Mass of St. Gregory'' is a
vision of miniaturized grandiosity. Also included are numerous
photographs, among them images by Walker Evans, Edward Steichen,
Dorothea Lang and Gjon Mili, this last being a view from on high of
the 1947 Madison Square Garden fight between Joe Louis and Jersey
Joe Walcott, so precisely composed it might have been staged.
</P>
<P>
   BARD COLLEGE: The tour finishes squarely in the present at the
Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, where Yvo Mesquito,
a visiting fellow from Brazil, has organized ``Stills: A Selection
from the Marieluise Hessel Collection.'' Its subject is vast _ the
influence of film upon recent art _ and was recently tackled in
``Hall of Mirrors: Art and Film Since 1945,'' an ambitious sprawl
of artworks, avant-garde film and feature movie excerpts organized
at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The only movies in Mesquita's far more modest effort are those
conjured up by the artworks themselves. This eliminates a certain
intermedia competition that hampered ``Hall of Mirrors.'' The
suspects are often usual: Cindy Sherman, John Baldessari, Ed
Paschke, Nan Goldin and Robert Longo, and the borders sometimes so
elastic that nearly any artist would seem to qualify. Mesquita
manages to show how different aspects of film _ the prop, the movie
poster, narrative, sequential frames, stereotype, romance, violence
and visual drama _ have infiltrated contemporary art. The show has
more than its share of dead spots, but it also casts many things in
a new light, providing a reasonable demonstration of the art
exhibition as a form of visual thought.

   HOLLYWOOD _ It's easy! Start a magazine with an eye toward
Hollywood and then sell the articles to producers who will turn
them into movies, money and fame. At least thav's the image some
might have gotten last week when Tina Brown announced she was
quitting as editor of The New Yorker to start a magazine with
Miramax Films that would funnel the articles to the studio.
</P>
<P>
   Well, any ethical issues aside, it might not be so easy after
all, say a number of journalists who have been swallowed up in what
they describe as the miasma of Hollywood filmmaking. Movies like
``Saturday Night Fever,'' ``Urban Cowboy'' and ``\op Gun'' grew out
of magazine stories, but many journalists said those are the rare
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Hollandsworth should know. Hollandsworth is a staff writer
for Texas Monthly, a respected magazine based in Austin that has
taken an aggressive, but sober-minded, approach to the$studios.
Hollandsworth said he has had nine articles optioned by various
studios, but only two have been turned into movies, both for
television. One, about a high-school girl seduced by the football
coach, was so changed by the time it was broadcast that it bore
little resemblance to what he had written about in the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering how much gets changed, why do they need to get
these stories from magazines in the first place?'' Hollandsworth
asked. ``I don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   His most recent success was ``The Killer Cadets,'' made for NBC.
Overall, he said, Hollywokd has been a source of frustration and
confusion, which has only made him ever more eager to focus on
journalism and let the chips fall where they may in the film world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your chances of success are so infinitesimally small that you
don't think about it,'' Hollandsworth said. ``If you write an
article with that in mind, I guarantee you're going to fail. The
fact is that journalists are on the bottom rung of the movie-making
ladder, and they should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Levy, the founder and publisher of Texas Monthly, said he
recognized that the long narratives the magazine publishes were
potentially good material for films so he hired an agent more than
15 years ago to try to make deals. The magazine is represented by
the William Morris Agency, which has sold options to dozens of
articles. Levy said that among the lessons learned from the
experience are that journalists should write articles and not
``treatments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no and no,'' he said in response to the idea that the
magazine might focus on pieces with an eye toward Hollywood.
``That's critical. Our editors are too smart for th`t. The point is
if we luck out and get a good movie deal, it's icing on the cake.
It's not the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Better Than Disney?
</P>
<P>
   It seems that hardly a day passes without the announcement of a
new animation project from Hollywood. A number of new animated
shows are coming to television, many for adults, and most of the
major movie studios are feverishly working on animated films.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the filmmakers are chasing the Walt Disney
Company, which all but owns this lucrative franchise, and they are
following Disney's time-tested techniques. But there is a notable
exception. The Imax Corporation is working on several 3-D animated
film projects, using an unusual new technology it has developed,
which bring an entirely new element to this genre.
</P>
<P>
   To get a sense of what Imax is up to one need only watch a
two-and-a-half-minute animated short that the company is showing
along with one of its popular 3-D movies, ``Into the Deep.'' The
short, called ``Paint Misbehavin','' was produced to show off the
new technique, which has been dubbed Sandee, and Rich Gelfand, a
chief executive of Imax, says the film has met with an enormously
favorable reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with animation is that to compete with Disney, you
have to do it better than Disney,'' Gelfand said. ``What we're
thinking is we can do it different than Disney.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning at an Imax theater in Los Angeles, the
short, which involves a character, Roman, twisting back and forth
on a ladder that appears to be tumbling on the heads of the
audience, set off squeals of laughter and had children flailing
their arms and reaching out for the character.
</P>
<P>
   Animation artists using the Sandee technology put on a pair of
3-D glasses and, as Gelfand described it, draw in the air with a
stylus attached to a computer. That produces images on the
computer, which are then transformed into a film that must be
viewed with the glasses to produce the effect.
</P>
<P>
   Gelfand and Brad Wechsler, Imax's other chief executive, said
the company had a range of 3-D projects in development. The first,
called ``T-Rex,'' will be released in October. It involves
life-like dinosaurs _ eight stories tall _ produced on a computer
and placed in a live-action setting.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Imax is working with the noted cartoonist Gahan
Wilson on an original film, and is developing movies based on
``Gulliver's Travels'' and ``Pinocchio.'' It is also considering
transforming existing animated films into 3-D, which can be done
relatively easily if the original movie was computer-generated,
like ``Toy Story,'' Wechsler said. The company is hoping to get the
first of these projects in its Imax theaters next year.
</P>
<P>
   True Grit on the Grid
</P>
<P>
   Can the MTV generation learn to take sports seriously as a moral
guide?
</P>
<P>
   That is the question being addressed by Brian Robbins and Mike
Tollin, the directing and producing team currently finalizing an
unusual sports movie, ``Varsity Blues,'' for MTV Films and
Paramount, which is due in theaters this fall. The movie is billed
as a comedy, but Robbins , who directed the movie and is a
producer, and Tollin, a producer, said the film also carried some
strong messages about character and responsibility, rather than the
simple raucous good times frequently shown in movies aimed at the
MTV crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a drama with a lot of comedy, in my view,'' said Robbins,
who starred for five years in the television show ``Head of the
Class.'' ``I mean, it's high school and there's a lot of comedy in
that, but it's kind of a coming-of-age story and these kids learn
some lessons. `Hoosiers' is really the model for this.''
</P>
<P>
   The sports films made a generation ago, the stories of Jim
Thorpe, Lou Gehrig and Knute Rockne, were thinly disguised lectures
on morals. The gritty sporting arena was a place where character
was tested, and values like loyalty and honesty generally won out.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the entertainment focused on young people today
takes a more flippant and irreverent attitude; just consider
``Beavis and Butt-head Do America,'' another movie MTV co-produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Varsity Blues,'' which stars Jon Voight as an overbearing
football coach and James Van Der Beek, of ``Dawson's Creek,'' as a
second-string quarterback suddenly thrust into the limelight, is
intended to be amusing, but in some ways it is a throwback to the
earlier type of sports movie. That is not surprising, coming as it
does from two filmmakers who are admitted sports freaks and have
long done films that take sports very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins and Tollin first worked together on a documentary,
``Hardwood Dreams,'' which charted the rise and fall of a high
school basketball team in a rough neighborhood of Los Angeles. They
also made the documentary ``Hank Aaron: Chasing the Dream,'' and
have produced ``Nickelodeon's Sports Theater With Shaquille
O'Neal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This film is really about the confrontation between the coach
and his quarterback and the team, and what they take away from
it,'' Tollin said. ``It's not just for laughs.''
</P>
<P>
   Tollin and Robbins also are the executive producers of
``Arliss,'' a show on HBO with a decidedly X-rated side that charts
the path of a fictional sports superagent struggling to maintain
his precarious perch at the top. The two have also created two
other Nickelodeon shows, ``All That'' and ``Kenan and Kel.''

ART REVIEW: WHERE CARAVAGGIO FIRST CAME TO AMERICA, IN 1943 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: SUMMER-LONG-ISLAND, SUMMER-NEW-JERSEY, SUMMER-HUDSON,
AND NY-SUMMER-RDP)

<P>
   Modern and contemporary art are on view in several Connecticut
museums, with a particularly ambitious and up-to-the-minute survey
in Ridgefield, but the most glamorous show is devoted to an Old
Master, Caravaggio, in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   WADSWORTH ATHENEUM: A year ago the Wadsworth Atheneum in
Hartford ended an old dispute with the Italian authorities by
agreeing to return a painting that was stolen from the Italian
Embassy in Berlin at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In 1908, the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica in Rome lent a
picture by Jacopo Zucchi, a 16th-century Florentine Mannerist and a
follower of Vasari, to the embassy. In 1947 Russian military
officers in Germany offered it for sale. Later it was on the market
in Paris, which is where the Atheneum bought it from a private
dealer in 1965 without knowing its provenance. Italian officials
pressed Hartford for the picture, but decades of fitful
negotiations passed until Peter C. Sutton, who had recently taken
over as director of the museum, cleared the way for it to go back
to Rome.
</P>
<P>
   To say thank you, the Italian government is now lending more
than two dozen paintings by Caravaggio, Carlo Saraceni, Simon
Vouet, Guercino and others to the museum for its exhibition,
``Caravaggio and His Italian Followers.'' It's a remarkable
exchange, and you should go out of your way if necessary to see
this excellent show before it closes on July 26.
</P>
<P>
   The Atheneum was the first American museum to buy a Caravaggio,
his ``Ecstasy of St. Francis,'' in 1943, so the show ostensibly
revolves around that picture, with additional loans from other
American institutions: Caravaggio's ``St. John the Baptist in the
Wilderness,'' from the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City,
Mo., and his ``Cardsharps,'' from the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort
Worth, Texas, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   The result is handsome but it is also clever for mixing, for
example, Neapolitan pictures lent from Rome with ones that Hartford
owns, to the benefit of both, and uniting different versions of the
same subject, like the three Caravaggios of St. John. Moreover,
along with works by better-known artists, there are curios like a
painting of a fishmonger cleaning a skate _ the artist isn't known
_ and another of a laughing woman, her face hard-edged, the surface
like fresco, by Angelo Caroselli, a self-taught artist and skilled
forger of the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   The Caravaggios are the obvious attraction. Caravaggio, better
than anyone, knew how to capture the posture of adolescent angst.
The picture from Kansas City shows St. John as a brooding boy,
slumped, eyes hooded; he is then transfigured by the cold,
impartial light that picks him out of the darkness and makes him
bigger than life, an isolated and hypnotic presence: Olivier
playing Hamlet on an empty stage.
</P>
<P>
   I was struck no less by some of the other artists in the show.
Bernardo Cavallino's ``St. Peter and the Centurion Cornelius'' is a
delicate, elegant image, the figures attenuated like Tiepolo's.
Saraceni's paintings bring to mind what people admire in Vermeer:
soft-edged figures in a clear and even light, jewel-like, as if
suspended in time. Saraceni was a less dynamic painter than
Caravaggio, but he could be more poetic; his picture of St. Cecilia
with an angel is a kind of silent music.
</P>
<P>
   Orazio Gentileschi was a Caravaggesque painter of poetic style
too but darker in mood. ``Judith and Her Maidservant with the Head
of Holofernes,'' from the Atheneum's collection, is a calibrated
mix of refinement and violence. It shows the two women looking in
opposite directions, listening into the darkness behind them.
Gentileschi paints a soft raking light across Judith's dress that
picks out some gold brocade, a counterpoint to the Cevered head of
Holofernes that rests on her lap.
</P>
<P>
   The Zucchi is here, too, by the way: meaty women bathing in
various odd Mannerist poses. It leaves for Rome when the show ends.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ALDRICH MUSEUM: ``Pop Surrealism'' is a big, boisterous show at
the Aldrich Museum in Ridgefield put together by Harry Philbrick,
the museum's director, with a team of curators. It surveys current
art that mixes Pop and Surrealism, which is to say most of what's
new these days.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the art gives a weird or malevolent spin to Pop subjects
(Jim Shaw, Paul McCarthy, Cameron Jamie, John Currin, Manuel
Ocampo, Robert Williams, Miles Coolidge, Pieter Schoolwerth, Peter
Saul). Some of it remakes Surreal objects (Bellmer redux) in
materials like colored latex, or as tchotchkes, giving the works a
Pop twist (Nancy Davidson, Rachael Neubauer).
</P>
<P>
   A whole section of the show is dedicated to underground comics
(Charles Burns and Gary Panter, Kaz, Art Spiegelman). And much of
what's on view involves grotesque bodies or bodies bizarrely
reconfigured (Cindy Sherman, Nicola Tyson, Carroll Dunham, Ashley
Bickerton, Tony Oursler, James Esber).
</P>
<P>
   Besides Bellmer, the unrepresented ancestors include Guston, R.
Crumb, George Herriman, Leger, Paul Cadmus, de Chirico, Beckmann _
the point being that what's new here isn't a completely new
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   But it is distinguished in a few ways. One is the emphasis on
minute detail and an almost obsessive process of construction. You
can see in this exhibition just how much young artists today seem
fixated on technique, causing a kind of unanticipated revival of
the traditional crafts of painting and drawing. Shazia Sikander's
riffs on Persian miniature paintings are an obvious example. Sue
Williams' latest paintings are another, mixing of Pollock and Matta
with the comics.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the assumption (it used to be a radical assertion)
among many younger artists that high and low culture now simply
blend together seamlessly. Dunham, a senior member among the
painters here, makes a remark along these lines in the show's
catalog: ``It used to give me fits every time I would read
something about my paintings because it was cartoon this, cartoon
that, blah, blah, blah, cartoons. It bothered me _ Walt Disney
wasn't the first guy to use black lines around things. Matisse and
Picasso used a lot of black lines. Then I realized I was being
defensive because my attitude about drawing really is influenced by
cartoons. It's silly to pretend it isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, I think, has been gradually, almost surreptitiously,
to shift our sense of what's beautiful and well made and serious _
which is what good art should do. With 73 artists and a big
subject, the exhibition is a mixed bag, with some questionable
choices and omissions. But the best work in it is strangely catchy,
funny and fluent. Whitney in Stamford
</P>
<P>
   As proof that there are different ways to slice the same pie,
Gregory Crewdson's photographs, which are in ``Pop Surrealism,''
are also in a show here called ``Where: Allegories of Site in
Contemporary Art'' at the Whitney Museum's Stamford branch. (Ashley
Bickerton is in both shows, too.) ``Where'' is a small,
helter-skelter overview of untraditional landscapes and other
singular views of the built environment _ malls, spaghetti highway
entanglements, abandoned lots, suburban sprawl _ made during the
last 30 years or so. Robert Smithson, Lawrence Weiner and Gordon
Matta-Clark are the Old Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Conceptually speaking, the show is thin, but it has art worth
seeing, including Matta-Clark's familiar photographs of houses he
cut holes out of during the '70s. One of Michael Ashkin's miniature
landscapes is here, along with a few of Martha Rosler's sinister
photographs of airports and Catherine Opie's small, dreamy platinum
prints of Los Angeles freeways. This was the first time I focused
on Gabriel Orozco's photographs, which always struck me as sterile.
The ones here, of unnoticed, hangdog places in the city, seemed to
me to have a delicate, ad hoc poetry.
</P>
<P>
   YALE ART GALLERY: The Yale Art Gallery, ostensibly celebrating
art at Yale since 1945, has put up modern and contemporary art this
summer, much of it from the collection, some of it by artists who
went to Yale, some of it belonging to Yale alumni, but some other
loans. Probably it's best not to worry about the details too much
and just regard what's here as a kind of extravagant summer filler
until the new director of the museum, Jock Reynolds, takes over in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   You might check out the room of works by younger alumni: a small
Matthew Barney sculpture, photographs by Lois Conner and Abelardo
Morell and (who else?) Gregory Crewdson. (Art is dominated by a
pack mentality.) Then see the galleries of more or less
contemporary works: several fine small Gerhard Richters from the
mid-1960s, a Martin Kippenberger collage, a Kiki Smith sculpture of
a flayed arm and an early Wayne Thiebaud of drink syrups. The rooms
of Katherine Dreier's collection have lately been reinstalled and
deserve a look.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the collection of European genre and landscape
paintings from the collection of Herbert and Monika Schaefer, which
is to be given to the museum. A painting of a jester, by a
16th-century Tyrolean artist known as the Angrer Master, is
especially unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   And don't miss the group of American 19th- and 20th-century
drawings belonging to Yale that includes a Dorothy Dehner, a Lesley
Dill, an early gray-on-gray Brice Marden and a funny Thomas Cole
ink drawing of the devil throwing a monk off a cliff.

`THE SILVER SCREEN: COLOR ME LAVENDER': LITTLE INSIGHT ON HOLLYWOOD
AND HOMOSEXUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (js)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Images and opinions abound in ``The Silver Screen: Color Me
Lavender,'' but genuine insight and reportorial curiosity are in
short supply in this film about Hollywood's treatment of
homosexuality during its golden age, from the 1930s to the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Written, directed and edited by Mark Rappaport, ``The Silver
Screen: Color Me Lavender'' is another of the so-called cinematic
essays by the filmmaker, whose previous works include ``Rock
Hudson's Home Movies'' (1992) and ``From the Journals of Jean
Seberg'' (1995).
</P>
<P>
   With a narration by Dan Butler (described in the publicity
materials as an outspokenly gay actor), who plays the womanizer on
the hit sitcom ``Frasier,'' Rappaport's film makes the unsurprising
point that at a time when American society at large preferred that
homosexuality remain hidden, so did its films.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Rappaport observes through Butler, the old films are rich
with relationships, dialogue, glances and other bits of action
susceptible to interpretation as being freighted with
homosexuality. And when these moments are presented out of context,
the assertion gains force. But at times, listening to the narration
is like being in the company of adolescents who can find sexual
innuendo anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Rappaport is entitled to his opinions, but devoid of interviews
with studio executives, actors, directors, screenwriters and
dispassionate experts, ``The Silver Screen: Color Me Lavender''
forfeits any claim to seriousness. And its hit-and-miss
identification of its film clips and performers is vexing.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly ``an incomplete sampling,'' Rappaport's film surveys
the prissy comic character actors of the '30s like Eric Blore,
Franklin Pangborn and Edward Everett Horton; finds and speculates
on homosexual undercurrents in the Bob Hope-Bing Crosby movies, and
spends an inordinate amount of time on Walter Brennan's playing
grizzled sidekicks to macho stars like John Wayne, Gary Cooper and
Humphrey Bogart.
</P>
<P>
   It pores over the jealous resentment shown Lizabeth Scott by
Wendell Corey in the triangle completed by John Hodiak in ``Desert
Fury'' (1945); takes a brief excursion to Europe to display the
lingering, loving images of beauteous actors like Jean Marais and
Alain Delon in films by Jean Cocteau and Luchino Visconti; and it
returns to the United States to pore over the womanless world in
the westerns of Randolph Scott, who was known to Hollywood to be
gay.
</P>
<P>
   Rappaport makes a telling point when he notes in a fleeting
comment that the highly praised 1947 film ``Crossfire,'' about a
bigoted Army sergeant who kills a Jew, was based on a novel in
which the victim was a homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Moments like this prompt a wish that Rappaport were less of a
superficial essayist and more of a determined reporter and
historian.

   Summer, as always, offers a mix of shows in the region around
New York City, which for someone with a car, a map, an appreciation
for bad roadside food and an esthetic purview big enough to
encompass Caravaggio and Johnny Weissmuller is a fair alternative
to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, for instance, the Newark (N.J.) Museum has a
collection of souvenir masks from Congo, posters of Weissmuller's
Tarzan movies and a foot-long model helicopter covered with bright
Zulu beadwork (it's based on the surveillance helicopters of the
apartheid era), part of an exhibition of odds and ends from the
tourist trade.
</P>
<P>
   Sound frivolous? It's not, but the traditional-minded might try
instead the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Conn. A decision by the
museum to return to Italy an Italian painting stolen during World
War II and bought by the museum, unwittingly, years ago has led to
an exhibition of Caravaggios from Italy: a stunning thank you.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hudson Valley, meanwhile, are two shows of mid-century
Americans. For a while Russian-born Pavel Tchelitchew (1898-1957)
had a reputation in New York almost equal to Jackson Pollock's. Now
he's known, if at all, for a single surreal and nightmarish picture
of children at play, which is in the Museum of Modern Art. The
Katonah (N.Y.) Museum of Art has organized the first Tchelitchew
retrospective in 30 years, revealing, among other things, his
wizardry as a draftsman and arguing for his renewed relevance. You
can decide.
</P>
<P>
   David Smith's relevance has never really been in doubt. The
Storm King Art Center in Mountainville, N.Y., is continuing, from
last year, a celebration of him: 57 works plus drawings and
photographs, mostly from the 1940s and '50s. The biggest steel
sculptures are clustered beside the center's meandering lawns
against the picturesque backdrop of the Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   And for pure pleasure, you might also make your way to Long
Island for works by Calder and Miro, linked in history by their
combination of whimsy and hands-on practicality; they are the
eternal optimists of modernism, brought together in an exhibition
at the Nassau County Museum of Art in Rosyln Harbor, N.Y.

12.)  
 BOND FUNDS REQUIRE SCRUTINY BEFORE JUMPING IN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing; moved July 10 in advance for July (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 35 years old, and I have $55,000 in stock mutual funds
with Vanguard, Janus, and Legg Mason (of which $17,000 is an IRA
account), $10,000 in U.S. Savings Bonds, $6,000 in an annuity, and
$10,000 in cash. I also have a $32,000 IRA invested in a CD which
matures soon. I'd like to invest the CD money somewhere with good
returns but relatively low market risk. A friend suggested a bond
fund. What do you think of this advice? Any ideas about a good bond
fund?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  A.F., Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, there are a lot of good bond funds out there, but I
won't tell you any names until I deliver a little lecture about
time and risk. At age 35, you will probably have this money working
for you for between 20 and 30 years. That's a long time. It's
certainly true that if you put your money in a good bond fund for
about 25 years, you will see a few bumpy seasons, but the general
trend will be relatively smooth. In my computer I have a program
tracking our investments, and an 18-month chart showing net asset
value (but not total returns) for one of our funds, Vanguard GNMA,
is nearly as flat as a table. The same is true if you look at the
longer records in the Morningstar Mutual Funds pages -- the net
asset value was $10.05 at the end of 1986; it's $10.44 as this is
written. Its 10-year record shows 9.26 percent average annual total
returns. If such a pace were sustained for 25 years, that would
turn your $32,000 into $294,890.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also true that when you're talking about two or three
decades, the odds are almost overwhelming that stock funds will
outpace bond funds. If you were to select a stock fund instead, and
if you achieved just one percentage point better returns than we
cited for the GNMA fund, the difference in returns over 25 years
would be $75,409. I suspect you're about as spooked with the
current market as I am, so I suggest a cowardly approach. Begin my
moving $31,000 of your IRA to Vanguard Prime Money Market fund,
putting the final $1,000 in Vanguard Index Value fund. Then
instruct Vanguard to move $925 from the money market to Index Value
every month. This will spread your investment period out over about
36 months (presuming average 5 percent returns from the money
fund). This is an investment discipline called dollar cost
averaging. If the market takes a substantial dip during the
investment period, you will be buying subsequent shares at lower
prices, reducing your average cost per share.
</P>
<P>
   Okay, suppose you're still hell-bent for bonds. My suggestion
then is this: build a portfolio of three bond funds, running most
of the risk spectrum. You might, for example, put a third each into
Vanguard Short-Term Bond, Vanguard GNMA, and Vanguard High- Yield
Corporate Bond funds. From this, you might expect a portfolio
average yield of about 7.1 percent, nbased on current levels. But I
still think you'd be better off adding that IRA account to your
list of stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   Since we're talking about Vanguard, here's an incidental note
for H.S. of East Falmouth: You can reach Vanguard by calling
800-662-6273.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Shortly I expect to receive $400,000 from the sale of my
home. From this amount, I must be able to pay for my rental
obligation. I'll need returns of 6 percent to 7 percent --
preferably 7 percent. My other living expenses are covered by
Social Security and CDs. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   H.S., Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, you might consider the bond portfolio I suggested for
A.F. in the question above, which would generate a 7.1 percent
yield at current rates.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with that is that the most aggressive leg of
that portfolio -- the Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Bond fund -- is
a member of the fund class that's usually called ``junk bonds.''
You'll have to decide whether you are comfortable with the risks
these bring. Junk bond funds typically invest in portfolios of
bonds graded BBB, BB, B and lower. Because of their relatively low
credit quality, these funds can experience two kinds of volatility
-- the interest-rate volatility that affects all bond funds, and
credit volatility. The latter situation makes these funds subject
to market pressure when the economy weakens and investors worry
that some of these lower-rated companies might not be able to meet
their obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, though, is that Vanguard's junk bond fund is a
very conservative entrant relative to its peers. According to
Morningstar Mutual Funds' last report, it held 5 percent of assets
in AAA-rated issues, 38 percent in BB-rated bonds, and the
remaining 57 percent in B-rated holdings. The average effective
maturity of the portfolio is 8.2 years, and the current yield is
8.4 percent. Morningstar reports a 10.25 percent average annual
total return over the last 10 years, and accords the fund a top,
five-star rating. (For the record, I own shares in this fund.) If
this makes you uncomfortable, you might decide to divide the
portfolio evenly between Vanguard Short-Term Bond and Vanguard
GNMA, a move which would bring the current portfolio yield to 6.5
percent, but which should give you a lower level of volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, because bond markets can be quite volatile, it's always
nice to withdraw a little less than the total yield if you can
afford it. For example, if you were to invest in the portfolio that
includes the junk bond fund, but to take distributions that
represent only 6.5 percent of your initial investment, the effect
would be that you would be reinvesting a little money each month --
probably enough to insulate your principal from market shocks over
the long haul, and eventually even to allow a little growth in
principal. If you were to follow such a course, withdrawing
$2,166.66 a month, and if rates held steady, you might expect that
over the course of a decade (which would of course see market bumps
of various proportions) your principal might have grown to
$421,659.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have been out of college for about three years, and after
much soul-searching I've decided to enter the Peace Corps. After
paying all my debts, I have $7,500 in savings. My commitment will
be for 27 months service in a foreign country. Where would the best
place be to invest my savings over that period, providing little
risk and the ability to take out the money once I return?
</P>
<P>
   G.M., Stoneham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, if you are indeed looking for little risk, the menu of
options is pretty limited and boring. You might, for example, shop
around for the best two-year CD rate and then instruct the bank
that the funds should be automatically moved into a 90-day CD at
the prevailing rate when it matures. Thus your money would be
available to you precisely after 27 months, and you would know at
the outset what your earnings will be for the lion's share of the
time. Suppose you get 5.5 percent on the initial CD and that the
rate falls to 5 percent after the first 24 months; the result would
be that you'd have $8,570 upon your return.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative would be a fund money market fund from a mutual
fund company. Such funds provide an only minuscule level of risk
(but, unlike CDs, they are not insured by the government) and the
interest rate varies daily. As a general rule, if interest rates
tend to rise during those 27 months, you would be best off with a
money market fund; if rates tend to fall during the period, you'd
be best off if you locked in your interest rate through a CD.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to be more venturesome, you might look at
conservative bond funds. For example, just looking at offerings
within the Fidelity family, the 30-day yield on June 30 for
Fidelity Cash Reserves -- its largest money market fund -- was 5.25
percent. If you went with Fidelity Short-Term Bond, the yield would
step up to only 5.56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Imagining that such returns were constant over 27 months, that
would translate to a difference of only $52 in total returns for
the period -- not, in my opinion, enough to warrant changing from
the ultra-low risk money fund to the riskier short-term fund. In
fact, the only bond funds that seem to me to offer a significant
difference in total returns, given the relatively short period of
time involved, would be the junk bond funds. But these cannot truly
be considered offerings with ``little risk,'' so they probably
don't fit the bill.

 &HT;    SOLAR POWER USE GROWING AS COST DROPS, REPORT SAYS
 &HT;    460&AMP;add
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By SAMAR ABULHASSAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fueled by falling costs of photovoltaic cells,
world solar markets are growing 10 times faster than the oil
industry, the Worldwatch Institute reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of solar cells, closely related to silicon
semiconductor chips found in computers, has fallen by 80 percent
since 1980, the environmental group reported. This is making
electricity affordable to more than 2 billion people worldwide not
connected to power lines, as evidenced by a 40 percent rise in
sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the largest increase in a decade,'' said Christopher
Flavin, Worldwatch senior researcher, who co-wrote the report with
researcher Molly O'Meara. While solar power still makes up a tiny
fraction of all power generated, it ``has the potential to move
from the margins of the global energy marketplace right into the
mainstream,'' Flavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Solar power is not yet economically competitive in the United
States, where it still costs two to five times more than
electricity generated by nuclear or fossil fuels. But as technology
matures in the next decade with the use of technology such as
``thin film'' photovoltaic material, scientists believe costs will
dip perhaps another 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In much of the Sunbelt, where air conditioning drives up power
demand, this price would make solar power competitive with
electricity from fossil fuels, Worldwatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, integrating solar cells into roofing tiles and even
window glass _ which allows homes and buildings to generate some of
their own power and even sell electricity back to the utility _ are
beginning to be used in a few pioneering communities such as
Sacramento, where the local utility company partially subsidized
rooftop solar systems for 420 homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwatch found that much of the recent growth in solar sales
was spurred by rooftop solar programs, championed in President
Clinton's goal of installing solar energy systems on the rooftops
of 1 million U.S. buildings by 2010. Japan is the world leader so
far, with 9,400 solar home systems installed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sklar, executive director of Solar Energy Industries
Association, said it's uncertain whether Congress will provide
sufficient funds to achieve the ``million roofs'' goal.
</P>
<P>
   But solar power can't become competitive in the United States
until people can choose the kind of electricity they want, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we deregulate our electricity market, one of 10 homes
will use solar power,'' Sklar said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is currently the No. 1 producer of solar
cells, primarily for the export market.
</P>
<P>
   But without market reforms to encourage solar power at home,
Flavin said, ``the current strong U.S. leadership could be lost
because the industry is likely to migrate where markets are
developing unless we develop a small domestic market.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A separate report released last week by Winrock International
suggests that renewable electricity, including sun, wind and water
sources, can be brought to nearly half the world's population that
lives without power for just pennies a day.
</P>
<P>
   The report makes a direct connection between electricity and
economic growth. For example, it says, a family of onion farmers in
Indonesia could devote 16 hours a day carrying water by hand to
irrigate their fields. But with a small wind power system that
operates water pumps, labor would be slashed to 100 hours per
season.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-page report is ``the first time the market has been
described as comprehensively,'' said John Kadyszewski, director of
Winrock's renewable energy team. Winrock assists governments,
private enterprises and institutions such as the World Bank in
bringing electricity to the rural poor.
</P>
<P>
   Kadyszewski, who has traveled to more than 30 countries, said
that field experience taught him that rural people in developing
countries want electricity and are willing to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt there was a big opportunity to make an impact,'' he
said. ``A small amount of energy changes a person's life.''

`SLAM NATION': THREE MINUTES TO SHOW YOU CAN RHYME WITH GUSTO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pop culture pundits have proclaimed the existence of Woodstock
Nation and hip-hop nation, so why not Slam Nation?
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly enough noisy poetic talent on display in Paul
Devlin's documentary film ``Slam Nation'' to suggest that the
competitive marathon poetry readings known as ``slams'' are more
than a passing fad.
</P>
<P>
   If the emerging stars of this frenetically high-powered oral
literary genre are unlikely to supplant the long-running legends of
world literature in academic status, they have helped make poetry
sexy again in a way it hasn't been since the heyday of the Beats.
Their work, which is much better appreciated in performance than on
the page, suggests the emergence of a vital parallel strain of
poetic literature.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Slam Nation'' devotes several minutes to the history
of the movement, which began in Chicago in the mid-1980s, its main
focus is a four-day national competition in Portland, Ore., at
which teams from 27 cities compete for modest cash prizes. The
spirit of the event is determinedly populist. Judges are chosen
from the audience and grade the competitors Olympics-style, with
numbers from 1 to 10. The members of the four-person slam teams
compete both as individuals and as groups. There is a three-minute
time limit on a poem, and anything that runs too long has its score
shaved. Musical accompaniments are not allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Poetry slams take place ``on a level playing field,'' the
genre's champions proudly declare. That means, among other things,
that academic credentials carry no weight. From the aggressive
recitations on display in the film, the pool of talent competing in
poetry slams seems similar to that found among standup comedians,
if a bit more upscale. You have to enjoy strutting your stuff in
public to make your mark in a slam.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the best poetry, like much of the best standup comedy,
is verbally akin to stripping naked. The most brilliant verse in
the world doesn't count for much at a slam unless it is delivered
with gusto and showmanship. Because the poetry slams are so closely
related to rap music, a good number of the rising stars of the
genre are black, and their work is heavily indebted to the rhythms
and defiant attitudes of hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest stars of the movement is Saul Williams, a
charismatic New Yorker whose poetry tends toward mind-twisting
cosmic rumination with hallucinatory science-fiction scenarios that
the poet delivers with an incantatory fervor. Williams belongs to
the New York City team that also includes Jessica Care Moore, Mums
the Schemer and Beau Sia, an Asian-American whose hilarious fantasy
of suddenly gaining vast wealth and exerting infinite power will
hit home with anyone who has ever daydreamed of omnipotence.
</P>
<P>
   If Williams has a challenger as the unofficial king of the
genre, it is Taylor Mali, whose team, from Providence, R.I., ends
up going head to head with the New York team. Mali is a ranting
comic showman and literary provocateur whose best poem in the movie
is a barbed critique of American speech patterns. In the poem, he
humorously observes how the declarative modes of speech are
increasingly giving way to the interrogative. His poem ends with a
sharp challenge to Americans to express themselves with conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Can the kind of work featured in ``Slam Nation'' cross over into
print? One book editor interviewed in the film is intrigued,
although he is not sure. As for recordings, one record label, Mouth
Almighty, already has a firm hold on the niche. If the phenomenon
grows, and there's plenty of evidence here to suggest it might,
``Slam Nation'' could one day be viewed as the genre's answer to
``Monterey Pop.''

   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - The centerpiece of Fritz Scholder's
``Chapel'' for the End of the Century'' is a large bronze angel
standing on a globe.
</P>
<P>
   It is a resonant and ambiguous figure: one you know you've seen
before but can't place and you don't know exactly what it means.
</P>
<P>
   The figure is disquieting. It is neither male nor female. And
although most angels have both arms and wings, this figure has only
a pair of wings and they are too small for flight.
</P>
<P>
   Scholder calls the figure ``Future Clone,'' which is an
ambiguous title. Is it a clone &UR; from the future or is it a clone  &UR; of
the future _ a second future like the original but different by
being unnatural?
</P>
<P>
   We tend to be made uncomfortable by uncertainty, and the whole
chapel rings with it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are clues.
</P>
<P>
   The figure relies on our cultural memory of the original: The
many figures of Christ standing on or holding on to the globe that
symbolizes earthly power. It is an image that has its own familiar
variations. For it is also Christ on Golgotha _ the figure on the
dome of the skull.
</P>
<P>
   The meaning of the figure is hinted at in the many collages with
which Scholder has lined the walls: his version of the
stained-glass windows found in Christian chapels.
</P>
<P>
   In those collages, you will find the bronze figure rhymed by
other images.
</P>
<P>
   In one, it is the archangel standing on the vanquished head of
Satan.
</P>
<P>
   In another, it is three astronauts standing behind a large model
of the moon, rising above it like three figures on an orb.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another, it is Charlie Chaplin in ``The Great Dictator,''
where Chaplin of the Hitler parody strides over the globe the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   It is an archetype, an image radiant with meaning, although the
meaning changes with context.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the Caspar David Friedrich that gives us the final
key: a small reproduction of the German painter's ``Wanderer Above
the Sea of Fog.'' It is the same image although the scale has
changed radically: The orb is immense, and the figure, a rather
middle-class German ``burgher,'' is small in relation, standing on
the pinnacle of rocks above the world.
</P>
<P>
   We are all that angel Scholder has cast in bronze. We all stand
every day atop the orb, like the ``burgher,'' although we only
rarely sense the spinning planet beneath us. &QL;

WITH SANCTIONS LIFTED, PAKISTAN MAKES MAJOR U.S. WHEAT PURCHASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pakistan Thursday agreed to buy about $30 million
worth of wheat from the United States, increasing its planned
purchase to reward Congress and U.S. farmers for acting so quickly
to remove sanctions imposed against the country for testing nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the U.S. wheat Pakistan bought is expected to come from
Washington state, which is the source of half the soft white wheat
exported by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had been barred from selling wheat to Pakistan
_ the largest importer of U.S. white wheat _ under the terms of
sanctions imposed after Pakistan and India tested nuclear weapons
in May.
</P>
<P>
   Congress this week passed a bill to exempt agricultural sales
from the sanctions, and President Clinton signed the measure into
law just 17 hours before Pakistan accepted bids for this week's
major purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan had planned to purchase 300,000 metric tons of soft
white wheat this week, and Australia offered to fill that order at
a lower price than did the United States. But Pakistan decided to
increase its purchase, to 500,000 metric tons, in order to steer a
sizable order to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan will now purchase 300,000 metric tons from the United
States and 200,000 metric tons from Australia. The value of the
U.S. purchase was estimated at $32 million by the Pakistani Embassy
and at $29 million by U.S. Wheat Associates, an export market
development organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting good rates, and we thought that when the U.S.
farmers and their representatives had put in so much effort, we
should buy more wheat from the United States,'' said Farrakh
Qayyum, the trade minister at the Pakistani Embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Australians had offered us a very competitive price, but
we wanted the Americans to participate so we held the tender back a
few days to allow Congress to go ahead, and we decided to provide
some satisfaction ... that their efforts hadn't gone to waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheat farmers, who are facing historic low prices because of the
Asian economic crisis and strong harvests worldwide, were delighted
to have a rare positive development.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is wonderful news,'' said Christopher Shaffer, a
fifth-generation wheat farmer in Walla Walla and the chairman of
the Washington Wheat Commission. ``There was a lot of concern they
(Pakistan) would hold a grudge against us for the original embargo,
but it looks like we've been able to work through that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan last year accounted for 40 percent of overall U.S.
white wheat exports and 37 percent of Northwest exports, according
to U.S. Wheat Associates. Pakistan purchased 2.2 million tons of
wheat from the U.S. last year.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. wheat will actually be purchased from a variety of
exporters, who buy wheat from farmers and sell it to foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much needed dose of export demand at a time when we are
facing a shortage of storage space and a shortage of market,'' said
Jonathan Schlueter, executive vice president of the Pacific
Northwest Grain and Feed Association, which represents commercial
grain handlers. ``There will be fewer ground piles (of wheat) in
the Pacific Northwest as a result. This will move grain through the
system, and we need to get it moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlueter said the industry had expected that Australia would
win a sizable portion of the Pakistani purchase because Australia
had refused to impose agricultural sanctions against Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest lawmakers, including Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash.,
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., pushed
hard to have the sanctions removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistan has been a good trading partner and is seeking a good
relationship with the U.S.'' said Nethercutt, who was one of
several lawmakers called by Pakistan's ambassador to the United
States about the sale yesterday. ``The purchase is an indication
that they're grateful, rather than resentful, and now we have sold
300,000 tons we wouldn't have otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton was also pleased with the purchase, but said the plight
of wheat farmers demands greater action by the Clinton
administration. He sent a letter to Clinton urging him to
re-evaluate a broad array of sanctions, to implement more
agricultural export programs, to support agricultural research
projects, and to push harder to get U.S. wheat into China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commodity prices are hitting record lows and the fear of
bankruptcy looms for many in the agriculture community,'' Gorton
wrote. ``What we do today ... to help our farmers will determine
their economic viability for years to come.''

FRITZ SCHOLDER AT LAST HAS DISCOVERED SELF IN NEW WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV. Photos have been send to NYT photo clients)  
 (WITH SCHOLDER-SIDE)
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BY RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - Fritz Scholder has always been a perplexity.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottsdale painter and sculptor is clearly the most
historically important artist in the Phoenix area. . His work
regularly appears in art history texts; if you live outside Arizona
and know an Arizona artist, it is almost certainly Scholder.
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s and '70s, his brash, brilliant Pop icons of American
Indians redefined a sleepy genre. Frothy with color and acidic with
irony, they were among the first paintings to look at modern Indian
life without the distorting gloss of sentimentality. Scholder's
Indians were not noble savages, but guys in Stetsons swigging Coors
beer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in the succeeding years, Scholder's paintings lost
something of their energy. The painter, wandering from subject to
subject, never seemed to regain his vision. The paintings lost the
sure-footedness of their color, and the iconic nature of their
composition _ a single figure on a flat, colored background _
seemed more and more to become mere formula.
</P>
<P>
   Scholder seemed to be going through the motions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there was still something churning inside him, frustrated
to get out.
</P>
<P>
   There were those who complained that Scholder had been seduced
by success and money, that he was just production-lining paintings
to pay the rent. Yet, if that had been so, he would certainly have
continued painting Indians, like so many lesser lights, repeating
themselves endlessly for a comfortable living.
</P>
<P>
   But Scholder didn't do that: He followed his demons, taking up
first one subject and then another. There were mystery women, demon
lovers, martyrs, Liliths and conjurers. Occasionally, there was a
landscape. He left behind his bread and butter and took up Egyptian
subjects, fetish items, skulls. He tried sculpture, lithographs,
even, briefly, jewelry. In recent years he has been attracted to
bookmaking.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear he was doing what he felt compelled to do,
following his muse rather than his bankbook. Yet the results were
not always completely satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is simply that Scholder has never been a
good editor of his own work. He doesn't seem to know the difference
between what is worth saving and what is worth trashing. As a
result, his shows have seemed unfocused and overloaded with weak
work. But that is a minor issue, in the long run. The &UR; real problem
is only now coming clear.
</P>
<P>
   The two new shows at the Scottsdale Center for the Arts are
breakthrough shows for Scholder. As if a foundering man has begun
to find himself at last.
</P>
<P>
   And the show makes clear both Scholder and his public have
misunderstood his essential nature.
</P>
<P>
   His landmark work from the '70s was Pop in sensibility. The time
was right and his bright canvases had the necessary pizazz. But
Scholder's sensibility was a poor fit for Pop, which is all style
and little substance.
</P>
<P>
   Scholder never really fit in as a Pop artist, even though his
mentor was Wayne Thiebaud, the master of the thickly painted pie
slice and ice-cream sundae.
</P>
<P>
   And for the past decade or so, thrashing his way through a host
of familiar demonry, he has seen himself as a latter-day symbolist.
His paintings were filled with serpents and skulls, crucifixions
and dream imagery. Yet, although Scholder was attached to the
symbols, he seldom seemed to break through to what looms behind the
symbols, playing with the alphabet rather than writing words and
sentences. The symbolism was no more his true nature than the Pop.
He was still on the surface. He was driving himself, but in the
wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   The new shows both seem as if a light has been turned on.
Scholder's better angels are awakened; his demons cast off.
</P>
<P>
   He seems to have discovered that his allegiance as an artist
isn't to art, but to life. That his experience is more meaningful
than the products of his talent. There is a directness to the new
work that has eluded him for decades.
</P>
<P>
   And a connectedness.
</P>
<P>
   The two shows are quite different. ``The Chapel for the End of
the Century'' is an installation in the form of a church. The
gallery has been reshaped into the form of a Christian cross, with
nave, apse, crossing and transept.
</P>
<P>
   The central axis of the chapel is occupied by three pieces of
sculpture. In the nave is a Minimalist block of metal, brilliantly
lit so it glows. At the crossing is what Scholder calls ``The Last
Book,'' an obscure volume on a lectern, whose words are difficult
to make out. And finally, in the apse is a large bronze, titled
``Future Clone,'' which is a pathetic kind of angel, teetering on a
globe of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of the transept are covered with collages, built out
of the detritus of 20th-century culture. They function as the
stained glass in this chapel. Each collage has a theme _ celebrity,
nature, money, war, artists, space exploration _ and together they
define our times.
</P>
<P>
   At the far ends of the transept are opposing discards. On the
south, a vitrine filled with fast-food packaging; on the north, a
Native American shield and buffalo skin. Is culture as disposable
as a paper drinking cup? And what have we lost?
</P>
<P>
   According to the imagery in the chapel, we have lost ourselves
in a tempest of effluvia, wasting our energies on trivia, all the
while missing somehow the central truths of our lives. The lesson
of Scholder's chapel is not an optimistic one.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings upstairs are different, but they also show the
artist going in a new direction. Instead of Pop, instead of
symbolism, he seems to have somehow been jerked back into reality.
He has reacted emotionally to the actuality of the world. And in
doing so, it is as if he has found himself for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The worse for us all, he has found the world at just the time
the world seems to be dwindling, gasping and dying. It is a
pessimistic vision Scholder presents, but it no longer seems merely
arty. It seems genuine, profound.
</P>
<P>
   The painting that greets the visitor first is a depressing
variation on Edward Hick's ``Peaceable Kingdom.'' In that famous
image, the lion and the lamb lie down together as, in the distance,
William Penn makes a treaty with the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   In Scholder's ``Heading Toward Extinction,'' the animals wander
off the edge of the unstretched canvas into an undefined fiery glow
that we must understand as their doom. In the corner, replacing
Penn, is a table full of drunks. One seems to fill the glass of an
Indian with firewater. They are drinking from hopelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Another painting, ``Sick Rhinoceros,'' owes its existence to
Steven Spielberg's ``Jurassic Park.'' Instead of Laura Dern and a
sick triceratops, it is a distraught woman and a dying rhino. Same
poses, but not some distant fictional dinosaur, but a real,
suffering, endangered animal.
</P>
<P>
   Scholder has found the right level: It is symbolic, but more
importantly, it is real.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is Scholder's reliance on Grand Guignol, and in its place,
genuine suffering. The garish faces of his Ensor-like ``Future
Faces'' might all be his own face in different masks. Yet, it is
not all depression and gloom. Scholder holds out the possibility of
grace. It is not much, but it is real.
</P>
<P>
   First, there is beauty, which is not mere prettiness to distract
us from the gloom, but the very real sense of awe at the splendor
of the universe. It can be found in the only three framed canvases
in the show: a trilogy that are the finest bits of painting
Scholder has done in years.
</P>
<P>
   They are three landscapes collectively titled ``End Time Land.''
The first is a seascape with a distant fire _ like those we have
seen from the burning oil wells of Kuwait, streams of smoke wafting
off into the sky and reflected in the water.
</P>
<P>
   The third is a twilight woods, with the similar glow in the
corner. The dark woods are equally menacing and comforting.
</P>
<P>
   But the second clinches it. It is simply a rock in a field. Like
an Indian medicine rock, it occupies its ground and demands our
attention as if it were the center of the galaxy. Oddly, a
similarly shaped shadow glowers on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite the brooding mood, there is in these three
paintings a simple issue: They are basically hopeless, yet they
ring with the love we all have for the world.
</P>
<P>
   Transcendent beauty is one out Scholder offers.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another, in two small paintings around the corner.
They are both titled ``Icon of Life,'' and they are pairs of
figures in the act of love. This is not some heavenly, disembodied
love, but the interlaced limbs and friction of lovers. The figures
are embedded in the gold leaf of an Orthodox icon, and like those,
make the figures seem holy.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, they are models of what has changed in Scholder.
Gone is the reliance on surface and unattached symbol. The artist
has given up on trying to be clever, even on trying to be a good
painter. All that counts is the experience of being alive, fully
felt, and fully expressed. &QL;

   &QL;  WILLARD'S MOM PUSHES FOR AIMEE'S LAW
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Kane
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 16 -- Gail Willard went from victim to lobbyist
Thursday, walking the halls of Congress in a bid to ensure states
don't release convicted murderers and rapists early.
</P>
<P>
   At a tear-filled press briefing, Willard recounted the horror of
learning that her daughter Aimee had been raped and murdered in
June 1996, only to grow more mortified when she learned that the
alleged killer had already been convicted of murder in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   A little less than two months before the murder trial of Arthur
Bomar begins, Mrs. Willard pushed Congress to pass a ``No Second
Chances'' bill, which its sponsors are calling ``Aimee's law.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bomar had not been given a second chance by Nevada in 1990,
Willard said, her daughter would have gone on to graduate from
George Mason University, where she starred on the lacrosse and
soccer teams. ``Aimee Willard would be alive, teaching, coaching,''
she said, adding, ``Those dreams will never be fulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., was already working on a bill
addressing prison releases when prosecutors charged Bomar with the
murder in 1997, and reports soon showed that Bomar had served just
11 years for murder and was paroled in 1990. The Willard case
``galvanized'' Salmon's staff to write ``Aimee's Law,'' an aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   The law would penalize states that release convicted murderers,
rapists or child molesters if they go on to commit another violent
crime. That state would forfeit up to $100,000 in federal funding
for crime fighting, payable to the victim or the family of the
victim.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in the Willard case, Pennsylvania would be able to tally
up the costs of investigating, prosecuting and jailing Bomar -- if
he is convicted -- and send the bill to the Department of Justice.
The attorney general would then dock that amount of federal funds
from Nevada, and send the money to Pennsylvania, reimbursing the
state and local police.
</P>
<P>
   The real incentive in ``Aimee's Law,'' Salmon said, was to prod
states into drafting policies that would not allow violent sex
offenders and murderers to go free. ``This provides both a carrot
and stick approach,'' he said, citing Department of Justice
statistics that the average time served for convicted rapists is
four years, nine months. Convicted child molesters serve an average
of two years, nine months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years, nine months?'' asked Luis Gonzalez, whose brother,
New Jersey police officer Ippolito ``Lee'' Gonzalez, was gunned
down in 1995 by freed murderer Robert ``Mudman'' Simon, an Upper
Darby native convicted of murdering his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are serving a life sentence of grief and lost loved one,''
Luis Gonzalez said. He mocked Pennsylvania's parole system for
calling Simon a ``model'' prisoner upon his release after serving
12 years for his girlfriend's murder. Within 11 weeks of his
parole, Simon, who is now on ``Death Row'' after pleading guilty,
had killed Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties groups say the law goes too far because, they
believe, some criminals can be rehabilitated. But Salmon admitted
that he feels most violent criminals don't deserve a chance to be
rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Willard, Luis Gonzalez and other victims met with key House
Republican leaders to press for ``Aimee's Law.'' The bill, which
has been endorsed by Reps. Curt Weldon, R-Aston, and Jon Fox,
R-Abington, does not have any Democratic co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   In her lobbying efforts, Gail Willard said it is difficult to
retell Aimee's story, now to a national audience. ``(But) it needs
to be told over and over again,'' she added.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Once this was the edge of American
civilization, a portal to the unknown. The Santa Fe, Oregon and
California Trails all started in Independence and Westport, two
small frontier towns long since melded into greater Kansas City,
and in the 1840s brave souls gathered there each spring for the
arduous journey by Conestoga wagon to the golden West.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kansas City is the metropolis in the middle: 1,435 miles
from Boston on the Atlantic, 1,577 from Los Angeles on the Pacific,
829 from New Orleans to the south, 768 from the Canadian border to
the north. The precise geographic and population centers of the
country are both nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But more than geography makes this the capital of Middle
America. There is probably no such thing as a typical American
place, but Kansas City comes close. That's why old-time
wire-service reporters were always told to write for a mythical
``Kansas City milkman,'' and why John Updike once said he aimed his
words ``toward a vague spot a little to the east of Kansas.''
</P>
<P>
   Before we go any further, Toto, I should emphasize that the
Kansas City we're talking about here is not the one in Kansas. The
older, bigger, more vibrant of the two Kansas Cities is in
Missouri, east of State Line Road. Though it's a Kansas suburb,
Overland Park, that has captured the biggest construction project
currently under way in the country, a $700 million,
3.1-million-square-foot world headquarters for Sprint Corp.
</P>
<P>
   This Kansas City is a plain-spoken place, a big-league town with
a small-town feel, whose favorite son was the President who more
than any other embodied the sturdy virtues of the common man, Harry
S. Truman. He grew up in Independence, rose through Boss
Pendergast's Kansas City political machine, an honest man in a
spectacularly crooked organization, and carried the accent and
attitudes of the Midwest with him all his life.
</P>
<P>
   Perched on a bluff above the Missouri River, laced with
fountains and boulevards, graced by unusually handsome public
buildings, this city survived the vicissitudes of recent decades
better than most. It remains a recognizable exemplar of the
turn-of-the-century City Beautiful Movement, and it has spent
liberally in the last few years to refresh Beaux-Arts and Art Deco
landmarks and build modern ones.
</P>
<P>
   William Rockhill Nelson, the imperious founder of The Kansas
City Star, did more than anyone to shape his adopted hometown. When
Nelson arrived in 1880, the city struck him as ``incredibly
commonplace and ugly,'' and he resolved ``that if I were to live
here, the town must be made over.'' Such was his wealth and his
willpower that when he died in 1915, he left behind a city so
transformed that it dazzled country folk who flocked here to work
and play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ev'rythin's up to date in Kansas City,'' they sang in
``Oklahoma!,'' the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical. ``They've gone
about as fur as they c'n go!/They went and built a skyscraper seven
stories high _/About as high as a buildin' orta grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kansas City still seems like the sticks to many Easterners.
Asked recently by The Wall Street Journal why his best steak is
called a New York strip and not a Kansas City strip, Chris Gilman,
managing director of the Palm, a Manhattan beef palace, replied
haughtily, ``You think we would name our steak after a city with
what, three people in it?'' To me, that's a bum steer.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to see how any open-minded visitor to Kansas City can
fail to be impressed by the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, which has
few if any peers west of the Mississippi. Lacking private
collections on which to build when construction began in 1930, the
trustees had to buy everything, and in the Depression years their
dollars went a long way. More important, they had the wit to hire
Laurence Sickman, then a 23-year-old graduate student in China, who
proved to be one of the great curatorial connoisseurs in American
history.
</P>
<P>
   Patterning the collection on those of Boston and Cleveland,
Sickman assembled treasures of Oriental art, especially Chinese, to
rival theirs. The roomful of rosewood Ming furniture, spare and
sensual at the same time, draws me back again and again.
</P>
<P>
   So do the glorious groups of Tang tomb figures, including a
posse of polo-playing women; an earthenware Wei orchestra, the only
one to survive from the sixth century, and an unmatched collection
of landscape paintings from the Northern Sung period (960-1127),
which were the models for generations of Chinese artists. But until
I toured the collection recently with Marc F. Wilson, the museum's
gregarious director, who is an Oriental specialist, I had never
noticed the charming, intricately carved little cages for singing
crickets.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in this vast art hangar, you will not want to miss the
rich, posterlike depictions of mythological and regional subjects
by Thomas Hart Benton (grandson of a great Missouri senator), whose
``Persephone,'' from 1938, once hung in Billy Rose's Diamond
Horseshoe bar in New York; Monet's ``Boulevard des Capucines,''
from the first Impressionist show in 1874; the courtyard cafe, good
enough to be rated by Zagat, or the four gigantic Oldenburg
shuttlecocks on the surrounding lawns _ welcome relief from the
building's neo-classic severity.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City has more than a half-dozen theaters, a very lively
chamber music scene and the locally based State Ballet of Missouri.
It lacks an adequate concert hall, but Anne Manson, the newly
appointed musical director of the Kansas City Symphony, has
announced her determination to remedy that. Only 36, she has
established a reputation as a guest conductor in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But the city's place in performing-arts history was earned by a
distinguished roster of jazz and blues musicians who made their
mark here, from Joe Turner and Mary Lou Williams to Count Basie and
Charlie Parker.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, a warren of more than 60 smoky clubs in the black
neighborhood around 18th and Vine Streets was the very heartland of
American jazz. The director Robert Altman, a native son, revisited
the scene in his 1996 movie, ``Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   Virgil Thomson, the composer and critic, who was also born here,
reveled in the happy contrast between dry, ``moralistic'' Kansas
City, Kan., and Kansas City, Mo., where, thanks to Pendergast's
defiance of Prohibition, saloons stood shoulder to shoulder. ``Just
as Memphis and St. Louis had their Blues,'' he wrote, ``we had our
`Twelfth Street Rag,' proclaiming joyous low life.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Now that era is celebrated in the snazzy new city-financed
Kansas City Jazz Museum, which local officials hope will turn the
neighborhood from a blighted backwater into a tourist attraction.
Major exhibits are built around four jazz masters: Louis Armstrong,
Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald and Parker, the junkie-genius whose
acrylic saxophone, on display along with Ellington's suitcase and
one of Ella's dresses, cost $140,000 in public money.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also space for lesser-known local lions like Basie,
Turner, the blues shouter Jimmy Rushing and the band leaders Bennie
Moten and Andy Kirk, who called his group the 12 Clouds of Joy.
Historic recordings can be heard through earphones.
</P>
<P>
   No less gripping for the aficionado is the adjoining Negro
Leagues Baseball Museum, which commemorates the Kansas City
Monarchs of the old Negro Leagues.
</P>
<P>
   It displays uniforms, balls, pennants and a diamond peopled by
life-size statues of black stars like Satchel Paige and Josh
Gibson. A highlight: the dramatically told tale of the integration
of the big leagues by Jackie Robinson of the Brooklyn Dodgers and
Larry Doby of the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   (If you're looking for live music, you'll find jazz at the Blue
Room, part of the museum complex, four nights a week, and blues
across town at the Grand Emporium in Westport, one of the top blues
clubs in the country.)
</P>
<P>
   Jazz, baseball . . . and food. The humorist Calvin Trillin, who
is white, made Kansas City's proletarian food famous, but it was
the blacks who came up the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers from the
South who created it. Trillin wrote a quarter-century ago in The
New Yorker that ``the best restaurants of the world are, of course,
in Kansas City,'' adding, ``Not all of them; only the top four or
five.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two, actually. Winstead's hamburgers, Trillin's hometown
choice, can't compare to Swenson's, the pride of Akron, Ohio, my
hometown. Lamar's Do-Nuts don't hold a candle to Krispy Kremes. But
Arthur Bryant's barbecue parlor, which Trillin still prefers to
Taillevent after four years at Yale and decades of world travel,
and Stroud's, whose fried chicken makes the Colonel's taste like
papier-mache, are every bit as good as he says they are.
</P>
<P>
   Especially Arthur's. For a while, it slipped a little; I
attributed the problem to the plastic gloves the health police made
the countermen wear when handling the brisket. In those dark days,
the flavor lost something. But now bare hands are back, slicing a
half-pound of slow-cooked meat, slapping it between two slices of
gummy white Butternut bread, brushing it with the hot, grainy sauce
that cures in big jugs in the window, and surrounding it with the
Best French Fries in America, cooked in fresh lard. Expensive,
sure, the proprietor once told Trillin, ``but if you want to do a
job, you do a job.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no stockyards in Kansas City. Well, there are still
stockyards, but the last time I looked, the pens between 14th and
16th Streets on Genessee were filled with weeds, not steers. But
the American Royal Livestock, Horse Show and Rodeo still fills a
180-acre complex each fall, as it has every fall since 1899. This
year's dates are Oct. 2 to Nov. 22.
</P>
<P>
   A more citified entertainment, available year round, is a
leisurely stroll through the central business district, which
retains a fine collection of Art Deco buildings. Among the best are
the Kansas City Power and Light Building at 14th Street and
Baltimore Avenue, which looks particularly impressive when
illuminated by a system of hidden floodlights at night; the
Municipal Auditorium on 13th Street, especially its lobby, and the
City Hall on 12th Street, with strips of recessed windows that lend
it a bold verticality. All were built in hard times, between 1931
and 1937, yet all display an unquenchable Midwestern optimism in a
streamlined, chrome-plated future.
</P>
<P>
   On the edge of downtown, spanning an interstate highway, is the
striking new 200,000-square-foot Bartle Hall convention center. Its
roof is suspended on 56 steel cables from four towering concrete
pylons, topped by four futuristic metal sky sculptures, which weigh
4 to 10 tons each. That method of construction yields a pillar-free
central exhibition hall; it also represents a vote of confidence in
modern engineering from a city embarrassed in recent years by the
collapse of a hotel skywalk and the roof at Kemper Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The skywalk was at the Crown Center, 15 blocks south of City
Hall, which was one of the nation's first mixed-use redevelopment
projects. The brainchild of Joyce C. Hall, founder of Hallmark
Cards, it replaced abandoned warehouses and tar paper shacks around
the Hallmark headquarters with a complex of office buildings,
hotels, shops, restaurants, apartments and theaters.
</P>
<P>
   It has come to function as the hub of a mini-downtown that will
be enhanced by a new science museum, a $234 million project
scheduled to open in November 1999, in the restored Union Station.
Proclaimed ``the great gate to the West'' by President Woodrow
Wilson when he opened it in 1914, the station is a monolithic
building of enduring grandeur through which half the nation's
soldiers passed during World War II. In an infamous shootout that
will presumably not be noted in the museum, Charles (Pretty Boy)
Floyd and his henchman Adam Richetti gunned down lawmen outside the
station in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another hub in this polycentric city is Country Club Plaza,
the nation's first suburban shopping mall when it was built in 1922
by a visionary developer named J.C. Nichols. It is now the heart of
a sprawling 20-square-block retail district along Brush Creek, well
within the city limits.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols sent his architects to Seville, Spain, and they returned
to create beguiling arcades of shops topped with multicolored tile
roofs and punctuated by Moorish-style towers modeled on the
Giralda. One of the earliest tenants was Fred Wolferman's Grocery
Company, which gave birth to the habit-forming double-thick English
muffins that are still made in the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a few miles east along Truman Road (what else?) you
come to Independence. There are three main things to see there. One
is the superb new National Frontier Trails Center, which celebrates
the courage of those who made the trek west. Among the moving
testaments quoted on its walls is that of the historian Francis
Parkman, who passed this way just after leaving Harvard: ``We knew
that more and more, year after year, the trains of emigrant wagons
would creep in slow procession toward barbarous Oregon and wild and
distant California. But we did not dream how commerce and gold
would breed nations along the Pacific.''

   Here is information about Kansas City, Mo., and environs:
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RITZ-CARLTON, &LR;  401 Ward Parkway, (816) 756-1500, is right
across Brush Creek from Country Club Plaza, so you won't have to
walk far to empty your wallet or purse. This is the queen of Kansas
City's hotels, with expansive guest rooms, a marble-clad lobby and
impeccable service from everyone, notably Daniel Persing at the
concierge desk. Luxurious in every detail. Double room: $165 a
night weekdays; $139, $159 or $179 weekends.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RAPHAEL, &LR;  325 Ward Parkway, (816) 756-3800, could be the
Ritz's little brother. It has 72 apartmentlike suites among its 123
rooms and an understated atmosphere. The staff is attentive, the
food is good, and all in all the place feels like one of the chic
hideaways you find in London. Summer rates: $110 a night for a
standard room, $120 to $130 for a suite.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WESTIN CROWN CENTER, &LR;  1 Pershing Road, (816) 474-4400, has
a bustling atmosphere befitting a 725-room behemoth. This is
probably the best of the convention hotels, with 31 meeting rooms
and easy access to the center's two dozen restaurants. A good
health center, an indoor waterfall and a heated pool rescue this
establishment from the sterility that plagues chain hotels. Double
room: $230 a night weekdays; $99 to $129, weekends.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HISTORIC SUITES OF AMERICA, &LR;  612 Central St., (816) 842-6544,
offers enormous suites _ ``big as a basketball court,'' says a
friend with a gift for hyperbole _ in a lovingly restored old
warehouse with a glass-roofed rotunda in the trendy garment
district close to downtown. No restaurant, but a free Continental
breakfast is provided, each suite has a fully equipped kitchen and
there are plenty of restaurants close at hand. Great for business
people. Room rates: $150 and $160 weekdays; $99 and $115 weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAFE ALLEGRO, &LR;  1815 West 39th St., (816) 561-3663, a few doors
from the Kansas line, has emerged in the last decade as Kansas
City's best restaurant. Steve Cole, the proprietor, and Allan
Samuelson, the general manager, provide exactly what the doctor
ordered for fin-de-siecle dining in America: casual but never
raucous ambiance, imaginative but never needlessly complicated
food, select but never absurdly overpriced wines. Fine after-dinner
drinks, too.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE AMERICAN RESTAURANT, &LR;  25th Street and Grand Crown Center,
(816) 426-1133, pioneered the use of regional ingredients in
updated versions of American classics 25 years ago. The stunning
modern decor remains fresh, and the cooking of Debbie Gold and
Michael Smith often excels in dishes like a Laura Chenel goat
cheese tart, sauteed steelhead trout and mustard-braised short
ribs. The only problem is consistency. The one-hour, three-course
lunch at $16 is a model.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE STOLEN GRILL, &LR;  904 Westport Road, (816) 960-1450, a new
storefront entry in the humming Westport neighborhood, pleases
demanding palates. Worth sampling from an eclectic menu: crisp
rosti made with celery root and served with bitter greens, and
Patrick Weber's skillful preparation of pork tenderloin, a cut much
loved in the Midwest, with a sauce made from Spanish sherry
vinegar. The relatively short wine list is adequate but not
exciting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PLAZA III, &LR;  4749 Pennsylvania Ave., (816) 753-0000, lacks the
patina of old-time steak houses like Jess &AMP; Jim's, the Hereford
House and the Savoy Grill, which was Harry Truman's favorite. But
it serves the best Kansas City strip in town, aged 21 to 28 days,
in a clubby room decorated with photographs of champion cattle and
their owners. Deep list of beef-worthy red wines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ARTHUR BRYANT BARBECUE, &LR;  1727 Brooklyn Ave., (816) 231-1123.
Every time I go, I prepare myself for the letdown that never comes.
For me, this remains the best of Kansas City's 80 barbecue joints.
Gates' 'cue is great, but the atmosphere is too buttoned-down. I
keep meaning to hit the Smoke Stack out in the suburbs, but then I
think about Arthur's burnt ends, the crispy beef bits that they
throw in if asked, and the car heads for Brooklyn Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STROUD'S OAK RIDGE MANOR, &LR;  5410 Northeast Oak Ridge Road,
approximately at I-35 and Vivian Road, (816) 454-9600. The original
Stroud's nestles under a grim overpass on the south side; this
branch, an old farmhouse, is more pleasant. You'll have to wait for
a table, but that gives you time to sip a margarita (first rate)
and work up an appetite for the crisp, amber-gold pan-fried
chicken, with a skin so succulent it makes you wonder what other
cooks do wrong. There are pork chops for chicken-o-phobes. Great
mashed potatoes, peppery cream gravy and sinful cinnamon rolls,
too. Forget the flaccid green beans unless you're from the South.
</P>
<P>

   &UR; NELSON-ATKINS MUSEUM OF ART &LR; , 4525 Oak St., (816) 751-1278.

`FORTUNE IS A RIVER': LEONARDO, MACHIAVELLI AND THEIR BIG DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fascinating, indeed the historically electrifying idea of
Roger Masters' ``Fortune Is a River'' is that Leonardo da Vinci and
Niccolo Machiavelli collaborated on a ``magnificent failure'' that
would have reshaped history, had their project been a success. The
audacious idea, to alter the course of the Arno River in order to
make Florence victorious in war and supreme in global commerce,
brought together the elements of genius for which each of Masters'
protagonists are known: Machiavelli's hard-headed, realistic
political vision and Leonardo's startling prescience as an
engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Niccolo and Leonardo tried to control both the flow of history
and the flow of the river by combining science, technology and
political power,'' Masters writes. ``To understand the
implications,'' he continues, ``imagine that the atomic bombs
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki both failed to explode, leading
to a costly and prolonged invasion of Japan by American troops and
the abandonment of nuclear technology.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a marvelously provocative thesis that ought to generate
some discussion. Masters, the Nelson Rockefeller Professor of
Government at Dartmouth College and the author of several previous
historical volumes, makes some important conjectures along the way:
for example, that Leonardo may have been a Florentine spy at the
court of Florence's enemy Cesare Borgia, and that he and
Machiavelli probably met at the Borgia court at Imola in 1502 to
begin formulating their project.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the materials on the personal relationship between
Machiavelli and Leonardo, as Masters acknowledges, are scant. Only
one document specifically links them, and it had nothing to do with
the diversion of the Arno. It was a contract signed by Machiavelli
_ who was second chancellor of the Signoria, Florence's governing
council _ that specified the terms of Leonardo's commission to
paint a mural of the battle of Anghiari in the Great Council Hall
of the Palazzo Vecchio. (The work was never completed.)
</P>
<P>
   The elements of conjecture rob Masters of some authority. To
explain matters, moreover, he plunges fairly deeply into the
convoluted world of Florentine and Roman politics, which can be
slow going for those not absorbed by that subject. Still, whether
Leonardo was a spy or not, and whether he and Machiavelli were
friends or not, there is no doubt that the Arno project existed. It
came in the context of a long war between Florence and Pisa that
occupied the Florentine leadership and drained its treasury between
1494 and 1509.
</P>
<P>
   In 1503 and 1504, a long military campaign against Pisa having
failed, Florence embarked on a plan devised by Leonardo and
supported by Machiavelli to change the Arno's course. The military
objective was to deprive Pisa of water and thereby force the city
into submission. But Masters finds strong circumstantial evidence
that the idea, at least as it existed in the minds of Leonardo and
Machiavelli, was bolder than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diversion of the Arno was not an isolated military action
to defeat Pisa, but merely the first step in Leonardo's grandiose
plan to create a seaport for Florence,'' Masters writes. Indeed, he
finds that the Arno diversion plan links several other important
elements of the epoch, most notably the voyages of Amerigo Vespucci
to South America and Leonardo's conception of the Mona Lisa. The
South America journey, and the realization that the lands
discovered by Columbus were not part of Asia but a vast and
separate continent, stimulated Machiavelli's dream of making
Florence a major seaport.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Mona Lisa, Masters speculates that its famous
iconography grew out of Leonardo's immersion in the Arno project.
``The background of `La Gioconda' has been described as a
surrealistic landscape, in part because it is seen from a point in
the sky, high above the ground,'' Masters notes. In fact, he
argues, the background resembles the bird's-eye views of the Tuscan
hills and mountains that Leonardo drew in preparation for the Arno
project.
</P>
<P>
   The actual Arno project takes up a relatively minor portion of
Masters' book, the rest of which is devoted to biographies of its
two main characters, an interpretation of their roles in history,
and descriptions of Renaissance politics in which both men were
enmeshed. Masters' description of the failed effort to divert the
Arno's flow is so succinct as to be a bit confusing on the
technical details. A modern-day chart would have been helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the concept behind the project is clear, and so are
Masters' interpretations of the project's influence on the
subsequent careers of both of his protagonists. Leonardo, he
argues, saw its failure as a lesson in the twin necessities of
money and influence, neither of which had been in sufficient supply
for the Arno diversion. His subsequent successes were built,
Masters maintains, on his skill in courting men of royal power.
</P>
<P>
   Machiavelli's response was, as Masters describes it, more
complex. For one thing, he turned to another of his favored ideas,
opposed by the Florentine nobility, that of a citizen army to wage
the war against Pisa, rather than relying on mercenaries and
implausibly gigantic projects. More generally, as he put it in his
subsequent masterpiece, ``The Prince,'' the successful state needed
to rely on ``good arms'' and ``good laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, there is a bit of conjecture in this interpretation, with
Masters perhaps overdrawing the importance of the Arno project on
Machiavelli's subsequent, remarkably up-and-down career.
Nonetheless, his description of that career, and his portrait of
Machiavelli as both genius and libertine, triumphant statesman and
humiliated intriguer, are among the most interesting passages of a
very interesting book.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The high temperature in Phoenix, Ariz., soared to a
record-breaking 117 degrees Wednesday, eclipsing the old record of
114. Blistering heat will affect the Western states once again
Friday as high pressure from the surface up to 20,000 feet provides
subsiding air and ample sunshine. Temperatures will rise into the
100s in many areas. The exceptions will be near the Pacific
coastline, where sea breezes and low clouds will keep temperatures
in the 70s, and over the peaks of the southern Rockies where rising
air currents prompt scattered cooling thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Summery heat and mixed sun and clouds will continue in the
southern Plains. A few thunderstorms will develop in western parts
of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas during the afternoon. Late morning
sea breezes will lift sultry air into towering thunderheads near
the Texas coast.
</P>
<P>
   Warm air overrunning a stationary front from the central Dakotas
to Iowa will spawn several clusters of thunderstorms. Scattered
thunderstorms will also develop ahead of a series of cold fronts in
the Northeast and Middle Atlantic states. Some of the storms over
interior New York and New England may be severe, with damaging wind
gusts and hail. An upper-level disturbance will trigger tropical
downpours in the stagnant air from the Carolinas to the peninsula
of Florida while isolated showers develop in the seasonal heat over
the remainder of the Deep South. Meanwhile, bright sunshine and
comfortable humidity will accompany high pressure in the upper
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Tsunami &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, an undersea earthquake in the central Pacific was
judged to be insufficiently strong to produce a tsunami. A tsunami,
a wave caused by a sudden shift in the ocean floor, is similar to
the storm surge of a hurricane. When a hurricane develops over the
open sea, there is little, if any, storm surge. As a hurricane
nears land, powerful winds push water toward shore which piles up
as the bottom becomes shallow. Tsunamis often possess great energy,
much of which moves swiftly below the surface. As it encounters a
shallow bottom the energy can be converted into monstrously high
waves.

<BODY>
 THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE EXECUTIVE  
 By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the middle of his legal troubles in the late 1980s, junk-bond
king Michael Milken paid for hundreds--hell, maybe it was even
thousands--of kids to go to ballgames in what everyone in America
saw as a heavy-handed attempt to win public sympathy. Deposed
Sunbeam CEO Al Dunlap hasn't yet shepherded little children to
Yankee Stadium, but don't be too surprised if there's some such
scheme in his future plans.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of public battering (some of it right here), Dunlap
broke his silence Thursday ((July 9)), giving a tearful interview
to the Wall Street Journal and turning in a stiff-upper-lip
performance on CNN that brought to mind nothing so much as Bill
Clinton looking into the camera and saying, ``I did not have sexual
relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.'' It's The Redemption of
Al Dunlap, Act I.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that heading back into the public arena in so
completely orchestrated a fashion is hardly the best way to dispel
the perception that Dunlap is a conniving, self-interested
executive who never cared about anything but his press clippings
and the size of his contract. Dunlap's hired a PR firm to represent
him, and presumably will be making the rounds of newspapers and
magazines soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   But at this point it's hard to imagine what he could do to
humanize himself. The problem is that Dunlap's public persona was
fundamentally a creation of the media, which loved his ``Mean
Business'' shtick and his penchant for slamming other CEOs. So his
attempts to defend himself necessarily come across as attempts to
reinvigorate that persona. He's like an aging nightclub singer
playing the Sands 10 years too late.
</P>
<P>
   In his CNN appearance, Dunlap was convincing in his denials of
any accounting malfeasance, insisting that the earnings numbers
Sunbeam had released for previous quarters were good (the company
has publicly questioned them) and that he played no games with the
numbers at all. But Dunlap didn't say anything about negotiating an
expensive three-year contract before news of the company's earnings
shortfall came out. And in any case, if Dunlap wasn't guilty of
accounting shenanigans, then he was guilty of incredibly poor
management. Either way, it's hard to see how he wins.
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said of Dunlap's insistence (both to the Journal
and Lou Dobbs of CNN) that Coleman Brands--one of the three
companies that Sunbeam overpaid for just before everything fell
apart--was in far worse shape than he could have imagined. In the
first place, Dunlap is clearly slamming Coleman because Ron
Perelman, who owned the company, appears to have played a role in
Dunlap's ouster, and because Dunlap's successor at Sunbeam was a
former Coleman exec. More important, spending $2.1 billion to
acquire a company without doing enough due diligence to realize
what a mess it was hardly inspires confidence in Dunlap's
managerial ability. Perhaps a better PR firm is in order.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Welch, on the other hand, continues to live up to his
reputation as the world's greatest CEO. In the midst of an earnings
season that's already shaping up as one of the weakest in
memory--DuPont announced Friday ((July 10)) that it would fall
short of estimates--GE once again met estimates and turned in
earnings growth of close to 15 percent at a time when the global
economic environment could be, shall we say, better.
</P>
<P>
   More than enough has been written about Welch's magical
leadership abilities, but the most important thing about his career
has been his remarkable capacity to reinvent GE even when
reinvention seemed unnecessary. He pushed through massive job cuts
in the early 1980s--earning the nickname ``Neutron Jack''--that
ended up boosting GE's productivity immensely. Then he switched
tacks to emphasize decentralization and bottom-up empowerment, and
now is pushing a Six Sigma quality effort that, if it works, will
make GE among the most efficient companies on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   If Dunlap is American business at its sloppiest and most
unattractive, Welch is American business not at its prettiest, but
at its most rigorous.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's important to remember that Welch's performance is
hardly unique among GE execs. In fact, as Jim Collins and Jerry
Porras point out in their book ``Built to Last,'' in terms of
average return on equity Welch actually ranks fifth among the seven
CEOs GE has had in this century. That speaks both to GE's
tremendous institutional continuity and to the perils of what you
might call the ``CEO as demigod'' school of business journalism.

   JACK&AMP;JILL-CLUBS (Undated) _ Jack and Jill is the venerable
social club for children of the black middle class. Founded 60
years ago in an era of inflexible segregation, it once organized
outings like children's swimming parties when public pools were
closed to blacks. During the 1960s and '70s, some blacks viewed
Jack and Jill as a relic as society became less segregated. But now
a new generation of parents who have settled in the suburbs worry
that their children are cut off from African-American roots. They
are making Jack and Jill fashionable again. By Marianne Rohrlich.
</P>
<P>
   CELLPHONE-OBSESSION (Undated) _ The pocket-sized accessories
have been a status symbol for years, of course, in the Hamptons and
other places, but this summer the usage and fascination with things
cellular has blossomed into an obsession. By
</P>
<P>
   GENDER-SCHISM (Undated) _ In 1998, an avalanche of books _ with
titles like ``What Men Don't Want Women to Know: The Secrets, The
Lies, The Unspoken Truths''; ``How to Heal the Hurt by Hating'' and
``How to Dump a Guy: A Coward's Manual'' _ have, beneath their
light-hearted, humorous veneers signalled a growing antipathy
between the sexes. By Alex Kuczynski.
</P>
<P>
   COLLARD-OUT-PROFILE (New York) _ ``We need to stop worrying
about what's in and what's out, and start thinking about what we
like,` said James Collard, the new editor-in-chief of Out Magazine.
Interview. By David Colman.
</P>
<P>
   STYLE-TRENDS (Undated) _ People complain that fashion moves too
quickly, but really it moves too slowly. This summer, a host of
style trends that should have come and gone as quickly as Madonna's
gold tooth are refusing to exit politely and make room for
whatever's next. It's a problem. Take the French blue dress shirt,
for instance. Gentlemen, it's time for a new look. By Frank DeCaro.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ There's something about the
perpendicular that does not love a lawn mower. No matter how
well-designed the machine, no mower can reach that last inch of
grass next to the garage, or the ring of turf immediately around
the trunk of the front-yard maple. Weed whackers, those noisy
contraptions that slash at the vegetation with a nylon string, were
invented for this reason. A more permanent and quieter solution is
an edging of plants. By Cass Peterson.

 BAD JOURNALISM? FORGET ABOUT IT  
 By JONATHAN MAHLER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it possible to forget a memory? Slate poses this paradoxical
question apropos of the continuing fallout from CNN's controversial
newsmagazine segment on ``Operation Tailwind.''
</P>
<P>
   To refresh your memory, the story's central figure, Robert Van
Buskirk, claimed to have watched as U.S. forces dropped sarin gas
on a Laotian village. He also claimed to have killed two U.S.
defectors with a phosphorous grenade during the mission. It soon
emerged, though, that Van Buskirk had failed to note this seemingly
noteworthy recollection in his 1983 book on Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Why? As other reporters poked holes in the CNN expose, Van
Buskirk confessed that he had ``recovered the memory.''
</P>
<P>
   But how do we know that such memories represent real, rather
than imagined, events?
</P>
<P>
   Freud grappled with this very dilemma in turn-of-the-century
Vienna. In 1895 he came up with his seduction theory, which linked
hysteria to repressed memories of sexual molestation during
childhood. A few years later, however, Freud decided that these
were not, in fact, real memories; they were fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to the 1970s, the heyday of pop psychology. A
backlash is brewing against therapists who are considered too
skeptical of recovered memories, and a new movement is born:
Repressed Memory Therapy. By the mid-1980s, bookstores are crowded
with self-help guides on how to deal with ``repressed memory
syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   The message is always the same: If you're feeling alienated,
disaffected, unmotivated, trust that inner voice--you probably were
the victim of sexual abuse. Then the inevitable occurs: A
California man named George Franklin is convicted of raping and
murdering a playmate of his daughter 20 years earlier. The
centerpiece of the prosecution's case is a recovered memory.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out, though, that the daughter had been hypnotized by
her therapist to help remember the details of the event. The case
was thrown out a few years back, but the question remains: What if
these so-called repressed memories are simply the product of the
power of psychoanalytic persuasion?
</P>
<P>
   Slate asked that of Richard Ofshe, a social psychologist at UC
Berkeley, and his answer was refreshingly unambiguous: ``There is
no mental mechanism that could create this ignorance of memory. If
anything, things of a traumatic character are more likely to be
remembered than forgotten.'' Recovered memory therapy?
</P>
<P>
   Ofshe prefers the term ``psychotherapy malpractice.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Van Buskirk, well, we may never know exactly what
happened out there. But we do have some clues. A psychiatrist who
treated World War II veterans reported that one man who had been in
a tank regiment visualized being trapped inside a burning tank,
though it never actually happened. And decades later, a Vietnam vet
who had never been captured acted out the experience of having been
tortured by the Viet Cong.
</P>
<P>
   Even more bizarre: As Mark Pendergrast writes in his book
``Victims of Memory: Incest Accusations and Shattered Lives,'' one
participant in a support group for Vietnam veterans, Ed, recalled
seeing a buddy's head explode during a firefight. When one of his
fellow group members called Ed's parents to help put together a
surprise party for him, his mother was shocked: ``What? He's in a
veterans' recovery group? But he was rated 4-F. He never was
allowed to go to Vietnam!''

 ONWARD, CHRISTIAN CLOTHIERS  
 By ALFRED GINGOLD 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Christians are at it again. Southern Baptists explain how
marriage ought to work and Cardinal O'Connor of New York, never shy
about his inside line on which political candidates will be going
to hell, wants no Major League Baseball games on Good Friday (or at
least not between noon and 3 p.m.) and no Little Leaguers missing
church for ball.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the likes of hymn-singing, tip-leaking truth-seeker
Kenneth Starr and Second Amendment expert Charlton Heston, the
country is in the midst of a renaissance of rectitude.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, faith is not enough for the really, really
faithful. They wear their devotion on their shirts now, also on
their baseball caps and their lapels. Piety is a commodity for
these truest of true believers, touted with a zeal that would make
the most aggressive huckster blush.
</P>
<P>
   You've probably seen the initials ``WWJD?'' around. I first
encountered them while browsing with my family in the Okefenokee
Swamp Park gift shop. I was unpleasantly surprised to find little
woven bracelets bearing the letters, which stand for What Would
Jesus Do?, for sale along with the gator mugs and kudzu T-shirts.
When we got home, I sent off a snappy e-mail to the authorities
about the separation of church and state park.
</P>
<P>
   A week or so later, I got an inconclusive reply, which addressed
me as Mr. Ringold, a suspiciously Wagnerian misspelling of my
Jewish name. By then, I realized that this stuff really gave me the
willies.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of ``Christ-honoring product,'' as Christian Booksellers
Association President Bill Anderson calls the bumper stickers, key
rings, coffee mugs and clothing now linked to Jesus, have grown
from $1 billion in 1980 to $4 billion in 1996. The big winner is
anything with WWJD? on it. According to Newsweek, 15 million of
those logoed bracelets were sold in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But there's lots more than just bracelets: DeColores Designs
offers ``fine apparel for witnessing,'' while Cross Wear ``rages
with an attitude.'' (I'm not sure what it means, but it doesn't
have the same ring as ``love thy neighbor.'')
</P>
<P>
   The grimmer, punkier side of the phenomenon features death's
heads, stigmata, and creepy apocalyptic texts. A T-shirt with a
silk-screened design of skulls, surrounded by the words ``Eat my
flesh, drink my blood-Cannibals for Christ'' would look right at
home in a head shop, glowing beneath the black light.
</P>
<P>
   And for that devout motorcycle thug on your Christmas list,
there's a black T-shirt with a skull and crossbones captioned ``2nd
death'' on the front and, on the back, a spiky, harsh drawing of
the Crucifixion, captioned ``It's hell without Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm a dyed-in-the-wool, freedom o'speech kind of guy, and
it takes more than visceral disagreement to make me want a
particular point of view erased from the face of the earth, or at
least legally required to keep away from me. So why does a
``Fishers of Men'' baseball hat make me want to spit bile? Two
reasons:
</P>
<P>
   1. Aesthetics. Christian sportswear bears the same relation to
piety that Tommy Hilfiger clothing does to good taste: It's a
cheesy, commercialized imitation of the real thing. For a bracing
look at hypocrisy in cyberspace, take a look at the claims these
schmatte peddlers make on their Web sites:
</P>
<P>
   -- XP Apparel ``helps people of all ages meet Christ's challenge
by providing clothing that helps them share their faith.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Spiritual Wear hopes ``to provide a means for individuals,
churches and organizations to express their religious
convictions.'' Actually, they go beyond mere self-expression.
``With our products we strive to provide the Christian community
with wearable messages that motivate people (to) consider their own
religious convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   -- What Would Jesus Do?, a company that moves ``WWJD?'' coffee
cups, sweatshirts, and watches, offers this warranty: ``Rest
assured that when you purchase our WWJD? products you are
supporting a Christian Ministry led by the hand of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me, but WWJD? is not a Christian ministry, it's a
business, selling its products by claiming God is on its side. You
don't have to be religious to be nauseated by entrepreneurs
professing sanctity for their products. Incidentally, while all the
Christ-honoring retailing sites I examined claimed to donate a
portion of profits to charity, none are charitable organizations.
Haven't these jokers heard about not taking the Lord's name in
vain? This is advertising presented as evangelism, and that brings
me to the second reason why Christian sportswear is bad for the
republic:
</P>
<P>
   2. The Spiritual Thing. Candidate Jack Kennedy reassured the
nation, skittish about a Catholic in the White House, when he
stated, ``I believe in an America where the separation of church
and state is absolute.''
</P>
<P>
   Time flies. Now representatives of both realms mix, mingle, and
meddle in each other's business at will. While we are used to
secular types such as Trent Lott weighing in with their views on
sin, it's harder to swallow when the folks at WWJD? tell us that
wearing their duds is a virtue. When spirituality becomes a selling
point, like mother-of-pearl buttons, then religion has entered the
realm to which it's supposed to provide a detached alternative.
It's not religion anymore, it's commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Blurring the line between church and state isn't always a
business strategy; it serves other forms of self-interest too.
Lott's comments on homosexuality surely have more to do with how
they play in Mississippi than with his innermost convictions.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's desire for a baseball-free Good Friday, on the other
hand, is surely heartfelt. But his opinion is not God's law, as a
great many angry Little League parents were quick to remind him.
Why doesn't O'Connor address his pronouncements to his flock
instead of the world at large and suggest Catholic ballplayers sit
out Good Friday?
</P>
<P>
   There have been observant players even in the majors, most
notably the great Sandy Koufax, who declined to play on Yom Kippur.
He did not, however, suggest that everybody follow his example. He
knew where to draw the line.
</P>
<P>
   It's a line the Christian sportswear industry does its best to
fudge, boasting that its wares are expressions of faith, when they
are in fact crass, occasionally intimidating assertions of
spiritual superiority. What would Jesus do if he encountered the
schlock that is marketed in his name? He chased the moneylenders
out of the temple, didn't he?

NERD VS. NEBBISH: WHO'S THE BIGGER LOSER? 
</HEADLINE>
  By FRANKLIN FOER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can talk about globalization, the sexual revolution, or the
civil rights movement. But one of the greatest upheavals of the
century is the liberation of the nerd.
</P>
<P>
   Many have noted the rise of the Silicon Valley programmer and
the iconification of Bill Gates. Few have placed these developments
in context.
</P>
<P>
   Nerds, once defined as squares and losers, now also lord over
Washington (Newt Gingrich, Al Gore) and Hollywood (Steven
Spielberg, Quentin Tarantino).
</P>
<P>
   Just as the women's rights movement revolutionized male-female
relations, so also has this movement created its own turmoil. With
the advent of the power nerd, we can no longer say for certain what
makes a nerd a nerd. Or, to put it another way, what now separates
the nerds from the nebbishes? The time has come to reassess and
redefine the loser.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody _ not William Safire, not the Oxford English Dictionary _
has concretely pinned down the origin of the word nerd. One theory
traces it to a throwaway passage in Dr. Seuss' lesser-known 1950
children's book If I Ran the Zoo. Another considers it a variation
of the 1940s put-down nerts to you, as in ``nuts to you.'' A third
derives it from turd.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its origins, the appellation rose to prominence in the
1950s, the High Age of Conformity, when boomers employed it to
condemn the most conformist of the conformists, the squarest of the
squares. And the phrase conjured up a specific image: the greasy,
pocket-protected teen in thick, horn-rimmed glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the unstylish, klutzy bookworm has existed throughout
history. (Einstein is an obvious example of a nerd who predated the
term.)
</P>
<P>
   But nerdiness became well defined only after the birth of its
opposite _ coolness _ during the prosperous postwar era, as the
middle class expanded to include vast new segments of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   These new constituencies adopted bourgeois values, among them a
fixation with fashion _ what's cool and what's not. Nerdy was not.
</P>
<P>
   But the popular understanding of nerdiness _ that a nerd is an
uncool person _ doesn't stand the test of time. In particular, it
doesn't survive the 1980s, an era the New York Times deemed was
characterized by ``nerd chic.''
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of the go-go decade, fashion magazines touted the
popularity of nerd couture _ plaid plants, horn rims and oxford
shirts buttoned all the way to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Further, witness the proliferation of '80s teen movies
valorizing nerds: ``Revenge of the Nerds,'' ``Weird Science'' and
``Real Genius,'' to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying this transformation of the nerd's image was a
transformation of the nerd's economic status. With their entry into
new high-tech industries, many nerds suddenly became millionerds.
</P>
<P>
   Let me posit a more durable definition than the nerd-cool
opposition: Nerdiness is connoisseurship gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   The essential characteristic of nerds is that they lack a normal
understanding of style and social graces. The essential reason they
get this way is that as youths they channel their mental energies
into a particular area _ film, computers, politics _ at the expense
of learning social conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Nerds may or may not carry their adolescent obsession into
adulthood, but the scars of their obsession remain palpable. (Note:
Rare is the person who becomes a nerd later in life. Bill Clinton,
for instance, may have developed an unusual passion for policy in
his 20s, but it never interfered with his social being.)
</P>
<P>
   The popular parlance conflates nerd with nebbish. But the
overlap between the two concepts is not large, more on the order of
this:
</P>
<P>
   While one could build a Nerd Hall of Fame, nebbishes are almost
always anonymous. By definition, nebbishes are whiners, lacking
self-confidence, generally inept, and on the losing end of social
transactions _ all characteristics that work against their ever
achieving fame.
</P>
<P>
   The only famous nebbishes are fictional characters: George
Costanza, Isaac Bashevis Singer's Gimple the Fool, George McFly in
``Back to the Future,'' and virtually anyone played by Woody Allen
or Rick Moranis.
</P>
<P>
   Other attributes:
</P>
<P>
   1) Nebbishes are necessarily schlumpy, never handsome or
physically robust.
</P>
<P>
   2) The term is usually applied to men _ often implying
effeminacy. But it would not be inaccurate to describe a woman as a
nebbish or as nebbishy.
</P>
<P>
   3) Few nebbishes are actually nerds or intellectuals _ some
Woody Allen characters excepted. They lack the nerd's enterprise
and obsessivesness.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, many nerds can be handsome (Gore) or self-confident
to the point of arrogance (Gates, Gingrich).
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the nerd-nebbish divide is pity. Nebbishes are
too pathetic to warrant actual disdain. They are too easy a target.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, nerds evoke envy. We hate them because they
are smarter, or more studious, or more focused than we are. Nerds
are genuinely threatening.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that the word nebbish originated in Yiddish, a
language without a nation that is spoken by a people repeatedly
beaten down by pogroms and thus in a good position to empathize
with nebbishes. So, to pose the obvious question: Is there
something inherently Jewish about the nebbish?
</P>
<P>
   According to the great Yiddish linguist Max Weinreich, Jews
appropriated the word nebbich from their Slavic neighbors in the
11th century. Indeed, other European nations with similar histories
of subjugation maintain similar words.
</P>
<P>
   In Ukrainian, for instance, the word ``bidni'' refers to an
unfortunate, pitiable soul. Italian has ``poverino.'' The fact that
nebbish made it into English owes much to Jewish Borscht Belt
comedians becoming '50s TV stars.
</P>
<P>
   Nebbishes will never ascend to the heights of nerds. There will
be no ``Revenge of the Nebbishes,'' no nebbish liberation. A
nebbish could never gain real power. More easily, one can imagine
nebbishes banding together to promote a nebbish agenda, kvetching
that they are systematically discriminated against, demanding
Nebbish Studies at universities, and complaining that history
textbooks treat them as losers.
</P>
<P>
   But only a schmegegge would ever bet on a nebbish. Visit Slate

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Long before there was a Disney, there were
Staffordshire productions. Ceramics factories in Staffordshire,
England, began producing china just for children about 1790. The
ones showing idyllic scenes of perfect children at play _ riding,
fishing, rolling hoops or skipping rope _ were probably directed
toward adoring parents, but most of the production was directed
toward the children themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As Noel Riley explains in her 1991 book, ``Gifts for Good
Children,'' in the early 19th century, ``for the first time
children came into their own as a marketing target.'' She examined
nearly 1,700 examples of this china, made between 1790 and 1890,
mostly from the collection of the dealer Richard Dennis of
Somerset, England, ``to study a popular but relatively uncharted
area of ceramic history.'' In the book, published by Dennis, she
concludes that more than 60 English factories made children's china
in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, cups inscribed with children's names have been
christening presents for centuries, and the antique ones are still
popular gifts. But such mugs were often made of precious materials,
like silver or porcelain, so they were expensive. Most children's
china is made of glazed earthenware.
</P>
<P>
   There was china for every kind of child. Some items were for
goody-goodies: rewards for good behavior. They say things like
``Present for William,'' ``For a Good Girl'' and ``Present for
Being Good in Church.'' The James II Galleries at 11 E. 57th St.,
Manhattan, have a large selection of children's ware, including a
mug with the inscription ``A Present for My Dear Girl'' for $600.
</P>
<P>
   Other plates were for baddies. ``I have plates that portray
quarrelsome children and cruel children,'' said Mo Wajselfish, the
owner of Leatherwood Antiques in Sandwich, Mass., a private dealer
who has what may be the largest stock of antique British children's
wares in America, including the ``Present for William'' mug, circa
1840, for $650. ``One shows a boy torturing a cat. Sometimes you
see bizarre situations on the plates.''
</P>
<P>
   Other dishes capture entertainments that appealed to children:
accordion players, the circus, dog races, and Punch and Judy puppet
shows. Sheila Chefetz, owner of the Country Dining Room Antiques in
Great Barrington, Mass., has an early-19th-century plate ($245)
called ``The Young Charioteer'' that shows a little boy driving a
go-cart pulled by miniature horses. Behind him sits a little girl
carrying a parasol.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the items made fun of adults, probably making them
popular with children. One plate in Ms. Riley's book shows an
outrageously dressed dandy trying to impress a lady; its caption
reads, ``Who binds himself till almost dead/And with a wig adorns
his head/And looks like a complete Blockhead/The Dandy.'' There
were also riddles, nursery rhymes and caricatures, all meant for
the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Other plates were intended to edify. Using transfer prints, the
factories represented the flora and fauna, even exotic animals,
designers thought children should know. Clock faces teach time.
Alphabet wares teach the ABC's. In the Riley book, a young man
standing next to the letter Y is shown on one mug, which reads, ``Y
is a youth, who has many kind friends.'' Another mug says, ``Q _
The Queen: God Bless Her.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite copyright laws, engravers at the potteries would
brazenly steal designs from books, magazines and popular prints.
Benjamin Franklin's maxims from ``Poor Richard's Almanack''
(1732-1758) were extremely popular. ``Diligence is the mother of
good luck'' graces a plate with a fat farmer next to his cow and
sheep. ``Experience keeps a dear school, but fools will learn in no
other'' shows a man in front of the village stocks. Leatherwood
Antiques is selling a plate ($385) with a Franklin maxim, ``Employ
thy time well if thou meanest to gain leisure,'' and two foppishly
dressed boys flying kites.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear whether children's plates were meant to be used
or merely displayed. As Letitia Roberts, Sotheby's porcelain
expert, said, ``In the 18th century, children were dressed as
little adults, so why wouldn't they eat like them?'' The plates,
she said, ``were employed to teach children good manners.''
</P>
<P>
   Wajselfish says the wares were expensive decorations, and they
WERE expensive until the pieces were mass produced at the end of
the 19th century. The early dishes depict the well-to-do at
leisure, and the humor reflects more a Jane Austen than a Charles
Dickens sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   Wajselfish has been selling children's creamware, bright yellow
canary ware and lustrous pearlware from England for 15 years at
antiques shows. (The next one is the Nantucket Historical
Association show, Aug. 6-9.) ``I grew up in England, and the humor
and charm of this china always got to me,'' he recalled. ``When I
first started selling it, no one paid attention. Only in the past
five years have prices gone up, because the pottery is getting
rare. You can spend between $400 and $800 for a single cup now.''
</P>
<P>
   Who collects? Julie Seymour of James II said, ``Our customers
are children, young adults and adults who think young.''
</P>
<P>
   Many potteries did not stamp their names on children's china.
``Some of the well-known makers, like Davenport and Minton,
produced and marked their children's china,'' Wajselfish said.
``But small local manufacturers made most of it, and their
anonymous workshops usually lasted only 10 to 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   For Wajselfish, ``what's important is the subject, not the
mark,'' he said. ``You have to buy what you relate to.'' He said he
was moved by intimate scenes of family life. When he bought a plate
reading, ``From an affectionate father,'' he said, he almost cried,
thinking about his own father. He is now selling an octagonal plate
for $350 that depicts a young girl holding a ladder that her
brother has just climbed. It reads: ``When up the ladder I would
go, how wrong it was I now well know. Who cried but held it fast
below: My sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Edith Wolf, the owner of the Bardith Ltd. antique-china shop,
901 Madison Ave. at 72nd Street, pointed out that French and German
factories also produced children's wares. In addition to her large
stock of English children's china, she has, from France, four
late-19th-century plates made by the Digoin &AMP; Sarregulmines factory
in Lorraine ($900 for the set), and a set of hand-colored plates
from Creil, north of Paris (four for $2,500).
</P>
<P>
   She also has an unusual Sowerby &AMP; Co. white pressed-glass beaker
made in England, circa 1850, that has a humorous bas relief, hand
painted in bright colors, that follows the activities of a young
redhead as he hopelessly attempts to do his lessons. It is $750.
</P>
<P>
   Second Childhood, a store at 283 Bleecker St., near Seventh
Avenue, in Greenwich Village, occasionally carries a few pieces and
currently has two German plates, made by Blenheim in 1910, for $22
each.
</P>
<P>
   Long before ``Ozzie and Harriet,'' British factories produced
plates with didactic themes and perfectly scrubbed children. Or at
least these are the plates that have come down to us. As Ms. Riley
writes, the survival of so many ``goody-goody plates may be because
they were simply less popular with children, and therefore less
used and broken, than rhymes and nursery stories that were fun
rather than moralistic.'' Either that, or goody-goodies don't drop
plates.

`SOMETHING ABOUT MARY' HAS HIGH HIGHS, TOO MANY LOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Of course there's something about Mary. She's played
by Cameron Diaz, who is such a knockout she could fog your glasses
even if you're not wearing any.
</P>
<P>
   There's also something crazy about ``There's Something About
Mary'': It's like the Three Stooges doing a sex comedy. Only in
this case, the Stooges aren't the performers but the directors, the
Farrelly brothers, Peter and Bobby.
</P>
<P>
   They've created six scenes of the most outrageous comedy since
their last movies: ``Dumb and Dumber'' and ``Kingpin.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, those wild moments are embedded in a huge waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if the Farrellys thought up these six great scenes, then
ran out of comic material and said, ``That's enough. Let's just use
hamburger filler for the rest of the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary, played with lovely fireworks by Cameron Diaz, is the girl
all the guys can't help falling in love with.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with Ted (Ben Stiller), who falls for Mary in high
school when he's a desperate loser.
</P>
<P>
   Then 13 years later, Ted wakes up, still a desperate loser,
realizes he's never gotten over Mary and hires a sleazy private eye
(Matt Dillon) to find her again.
</P>
<P>
   The detective also falls for Mary and uses everything he's
learned from spying on her to romance her.
</P>
<P>
   When Ted plunges back into the chase, we learn that there's
plenty of competition in the fixated-on-Mary race.
</P>
<P>
   You really can't blame them: Mary's the all-American guy's girl:
she wants nothing more than a man who loves sports, hot dogs, beer
and a woman with a tendency to get dressed in front of open
windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Something About Mary'' has a strange comic rhythm. If
it were a roller coaster, you'd fly over this huge cliff screaming
your head off, then creep along a flat stretch for about 15 minutes
of snooze time before the next thrill.
</P>
<P>
   But those big scenes, they're wild. If you love those
I-can't-believe-they-did-that comic moments, the ones that offend
most civilized people, this movie has them.
</P>
<P>
   The Farrellys explore the realm of humiliating dates and come up
with some all-time embarrassments. They're enough to make you
change your entire wardrobe from zippers to Velcro.
</P>
<P>
   When the Farrellys get onto a gag, they don't know when to stop.
They just keep heaping on the gross, embarrassing nuttiness until
you're either howling or ready to walk out, more offended than you
thought a comedy could make you feel.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, as the object of adoration, is a delight. When she walks
across the screen, you wonder why they don't devote an entire movie
to that subject.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Stiller nor Dillon add much to the fun. The big scenes
are funny because of their outrageous content, not because they're
played funny by the stars.
</P>
<P>
   You don't realize how bland Stiller and Dillon are until a
non-actor sports star drops in for a cameo with all the impact of
flat beer, and you realize that he's doing exactly what the pros
are doing: nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Stiller (''Flirting With Disaster)'' has a comic range that
shifts slightly from embarrassment to humiliation, which fits some
scenes. But his comic bits prove useless in livening up the film
when the Farrellys run short of material.
</P>
<P>
   You begin to be diverted by such thoughts as: is Stiller wearing
prosthetic ears? And why is he trying to impersonate a 10-year-old
boy?
</P>
<P>
   Dillon has a few good scenes as a sleazy jerk, but he's not
nearly as funny as he was in ``The Flamingo Kid'' or ``In &AMP; Out.''
</P>
<P>
   If the kind of offensive comedy the Farrelly's created in ``Dumb
</P>
<P>
   and Dumber'' cracks you up, then you'll love the big scenes in
``There's Something About Mary'' and forgive the rest. But you
could go out of the theater in between those big scenes, make a
couple phone calls and not miss anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Something About Mary'' is rated R for profanity,
nudity and sex. 3 stars.

ABC FOLLOWS FOX'S LEAD WITH `MAXIMUM BOB' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Six months ago at this semiannual gathering
of TV critics and TV programmers, ABC said it would introduce a
new, original series this summer, a tactic the Fox network has had
some success with. The keystone of ABC's effort is ``Maximum Bob,''
a one-hour drama about a flamboyant Florida judge, adapted from the
Elmore Leonard novel. It premieres Aug. 4 in the ``NYPD Blue''
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Beau Bridges is Maximum Bob Gibbs, who meets his match in a
feisty public defender played by Liz Vassey. Early consensus at the
fall-season press tour in Pasadena is that the bizarre and funny
``Maximum Bob'' is as good as anything ABC has on its fall
schedule, yet ``Bob'' right now is just a seven-episode series that
will end with the network's fall rollout.
</P>
<P>
   ABC says ``Bob'' will return as a midseason substitute if
audiences like it, but Bridges is philosophical about the show's
short season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a long time ago not to have any expectations as far
as longevity goes in a television series,'' he said, ``because
after the actors have done their best, there's really nothing we
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridges said being in the ``NYPD Blue'' time slot for seven
weeks in a row is an enviable launch position in any season, given
the realities of the TV business.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what time of the year you go on,'' he said, ``you've
only got four or five shows to catch people's attention. If you
don't do it by then, you're going to be off anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the less stultifying schedules unveiled so far in
Pasadena belongs to VH1, the older-skewing spinoff of MTV. Starting
with ``Rock &AMP; Roll Jeopardy!'' (premiering Aug. 8), VH1 will unveil
six new fall-season series that follow on the success of quirky
hits like ``Pop-Up Video.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock &AMP; Roll Jeopardy!'' is fairly straightforward: The format
is the same as ``Jeopardy!'' but all the categories relate to rock
music in some way, and Alex Trebek stays home. Jeff Probst, a
correspondent for ``Access Hollywood,'' is the host.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vinyl Justice,'' meanwhile, is highly goofy, with two actors
(Barry Sobel and Wayne Brady) posing as ``music police.'' For
example, they write up one person for playing hip hop in a Volvo.
Another regular segment features ``investigations'' of celebrities'
CD collections.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``Rock of Ages,'' which shows diverse groups of
people watching videos and offering opinions on musical styles and
on even weightier matters, such as whether the members of Hanson
are male or female.
</P>
<P>
   The other three new shows are ``Video Timeline,'' looking at the
careers of music's big names chronologically through their videos;
``Viva Le Rock,'' a satirical newsmagazine exploring the outrageous
side of the music business, and ``Where Are They Now?'' an hourlong
show that perpetuates the cachet of four ``Where Are They Now?''
specials that have already aired. Upcoming topics: girl bands, bad
boys of rock, and winners of the Grammy for best new artist.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise! ABC executives Stu Bloomberg and Jamie Tarses are
bullish on this fall's lineup, which includes five new comedies and
three new dramas.
</P>
<P>
   But Bloomberg, chairman of ABC Entertainment, deserves a little
credit for facing facts, the scariest being ABC's dismal showing
last season among viewers in the 18-to-49 age group, the most
highly prized by advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research has armed me with so much ammunition that I could
probably convince you that last season was a brilliant season,''
Bloomberg said. ``We still won four out of seven nights, we had
seven out of the top 20 series, we won 32 percent of all
half-hours, and our demographics were broader than the other
networks and were spread across the entire week and not just one
night.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all true, which demonstrates how good the networks are at
massaging numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you guys know the other truths,'' Bloomberg said. ``We
played `Home Improvement' to death and weakened Tuesday night, we
had critically acclaimed but viewer-challenged dramas, `TGIF'
(Friday programming) relied too heavily on gimmick-oriented
concepts, and our movies failed to reach the right audience and,
some might say, any audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg and Tarses, president of ABC Entertainment, said ABC's
goal this season is to deliver ``smart, urban, fresh, funny and
inclusive'' shows. Perhaps mindful of criticism that ABC mistreated
quality shows like ``Nothing Sacred'' and ``Cracker'' last season,
Tarses said the network will make it easier to find shows, and that
it will program with greater ``consistency and clarity.''

`ZORRO' IS A GRAND OLD SWASHBUCKLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFF SHANNON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The creators of ``The Mask of Zorro'' wanted to reintroduce the
fabled hero to young '90s audiences with an operatic flair, so
they've beefed up the masked avenger's legacy with enough tragedy,
treachery and hard-earned redemption to make it as ripe as anything
Verdi ever staged.
</P>
<P>
   It's a vigorous crowd pleaser that gradually betrays its own
noble ambitions, but it's also got enough gusto and agility to
qualify as a satisfying swashbuckler in the grand old style.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Fairbanks was a better swordsman than either Anthony
Hopkins or Antonio Banderas, who play Zorro here as a
master-student combo, with Don Diego de la Vega (Hopkins) passing
the torch after serving served 20 years of an unjust prison
sentence. But Fairbanks would surely approve of this dual effort of
charismatic stars, and the sly combination of Hopkins' gravity and
Banderas's seductive insouciance.
</P>
<P>
   Top it off with parallel subplots of vengeance and you've got
familial honor of ``Godfather'' proportions, albeit with old-world
etiquette and more witty joie de vivre.
</P>
<P>
   Don Diego was jailed by Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson), the Spanish
governor of Alta California, in a confrontation that cost the life
of Diego's beloved wife (Julietta Rosen) and possession of his
infant daughter Elena, who was raised by Rafael with no knowledge
of her real father's fate. Two decades later, Mexican bandit
Alejandro Murieta (Banderas) suffers a similar loss to Rafael's
ironically-named military henchman Capt. Love (Matt Letscher), who
yearns for the now stunningly beautiful Elena (Catherine
Zeta-Jones).
</P>
<P>
   Having passed his time in the heroic spotlight, Diego grooms
Murieta to be the new Zorro, joining forces to combat Rafael's plot
to exploit Mexicans in his quest to purchase California from Spain.
</P>
<P>
   You can easily figure out the rest of the scenario, which
escalates into a zesty display of swordplay, clever maneuvering and
an explosive free-the-slaves climax. ``The Mask of Zorro'' is more
effective in set-up than payoff, and after piling on its subplots
it gradually gives way to the kind of mayhem that director Martin
Campbell handles so well in his 007 blockbuster ``GoldenEye.''
</P>
<P>
   No telling what young maverick Robert Rodriguez would have done
with the movie; he bailed over contract disputes two months before
cameras rolled. But Cambell seems more in line with the lavish,
glossy vision of Steven Spielberg, who fostered the project and was
once intending to direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mask of Zorro'' has just enough sophistication to satisfy
adults (and a script good enough to attract this stellar cast), but
like ``Braveheart' and ``Rob Roy,'' it's an action-drama with youth
appeal and some indulgent concessions to a mainstream audience.
</P>
<P>
   Even at 136 minutes, the story takes some conspicuous shortcuts
(as when Banderas goes from crude rogue to diplomatic ``gentleman''
virtually overnight) and, after all its dashing fancy, it falls
back on a rousing but routine action finale.
</P>
<P>
   And Zeta-Jones, despite the intelligence and grit of her
character, is basically the target of Banderas's sexy (and
occasionally sexist) humor. It's all delightfully good-natured, but
the now-familiar gag (in which Zorro precisely slices Elena's
night-dress off with his sword) tells you where the movie's (and
Zorro's) priorities lie.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part it's good. It could have been better.
</P>
<P>
   The Mask of Zorro. Directed by Martin Campbell. Screenplay by
John Eskow and Ted Elliott &AMP; Terry Rossio. Cast: Anthony Hopkins,
Antonio Banderas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stuart Wilson, Matt
Letscher. Tri-Star Pictures. 136 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence,
mature humor.

`THE NET': BASED ON THE MOVIE, BUT WANTING TO BE `THE X-FILES' 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Angela Bennett, a young, beautiful and reclusive (``I keep to
myself'') free-lance programmer, gets a weird e-mail message about
something called Copper Canyon. She shrugs it off and goes for her
daily run, but when she stops at an ATM, the screen tells her that
her account is closed. A carful of FBI agents promptly arrest her,
believing that she is a criminal named Elizabeth Marx.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as we see, while Angela (Brooke Langton, formerly of
``Melrose Place'') was innocently jogging past the Seattle skyline,
someone was changing all computerized records of her past so that
Angela no longer exists and Angela herself appears to be Liz.
</P>
<P>
   A National Security Agency operative (Joseph Bottoms), oozing
charm, offers to help but turns out to be a fraud. He's soon
standing in her living room, pointing a gun and shouting: ``NSA,
FBI, CIA! They all have too many boundaries, Angela. What we do is
more important, more practical. Give me my e-mail!''
</P>
<P>
   All of this happens in the first half-hour of the premiere of
``The Net'' (Sunday night at 9), USA's new hourlong drama series
based on the 1995 Sandra Bullock film of the same name. But once
the computerized identity changing is done (before the first
commercial), ``The Net'' wants to be something else entirely: ``The
X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to everything, you see, is a mysterious 1984 confab at
Copper Canyon attended by ``the military, philosophers,
theologians, chaos theorists'' and, wouldn't you know it, Angela's
long-lost father. She finds his file in a huge room lined with
cardboard boxes. Meanwhile, her new traveling companion, a
scientist who attended the 1984 meeting, finds evidence that proves
the space shuttle Challenger explosion and other disasters were
planned and carried out by an evil secret agency. When Angela needs
confirmation or just emotional support, she talks to an anonymous
character named Sorceror (the voice of Tim Curry) via her laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Langton seems to be a good enough actress, but she doesn't
have the lovable vulnerability that Ms. Bullock, at her
post-``Speed'' peak, brought to the movie role. And Ms. Langton
doesn't exude the sexy spookiness of David Duchovny as Fox Mulder,
the character who is clearly Angela's male counterpart. The show
itself is inoffensive if a little obvious and could go either way.
</P>
<P>
   The oddest thing is that just when you're expecting a guest
appearance by the Cigarette-Smoking Man, Sorceror's disembodied
voice says ``Stay out of it, Angel'' and Farrah Fawcett, Kate
Jackson and Jaclyn Smith in their '70s prime come to mind. It's
probably just a coincidence.

ODD `BUFFALO 66 MIXES FANTASY AND REALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Buffalo 66'' is named after the Buffalo Bills football team
and the year in which the story's hero was born.
</P>
<P>
   Written by actor Vincent Gallo, who also directs and stars, the
film is about Billy Brown (Gallo), a poor schlub who harbors a
grudge against former Bills' place kicker Scott Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Billy believes Woods wrecked his life by throwing a big game,
causing him to lose a fortune to the local hoods. The only way he
can repay the debt is to take the fall for one of the gang's thugs,
and he goes to prison for a crime he never committed. After Billy
is let out of jail, he returns home to Buffalo to even the score
against those who wrecked his life and his big chance at being the
best bowler in town.
</P>
<P>
   The film features a tender supporting performance by Christina
Ricci as Layla, the young tap dance student Billy clumsily kidnaps
to act as his wife on his homecoming visit to his negligent
parents, played with a scary ferocity and humor by Ben Gazzara and
Anjelica Huston.
</P>
<P>
   Billy's folks embrace Layla as the daughter they never had,
pouring her a glass of wine, stuffing her full of tripe stew, and
telling her they love her. But they ignore Billy, looking at their
son as if he were a stranger, and indeed, he's lied to them for
five years, telling them he's been on a covert mission for the CIA
instead of wasting away in a prison cell.
</P>
<P>
   This odd film _ which won raves at Sundance and played the
recent Seattle International Film Festival _ is full of surprises,
some good, some not so believeable.
</P>
<P>
   It's sadly funny as well as whimsical in spite of its backdrop
of potentially abrasive _ and highly abusive _ situations. It's a
strange mix of gritty realism and fantasy stirred together into an
unusual love story that thankfully only flirts, and then flees,
from violence. It's about missed opportunity, shattered dreams and
trying to make a mark in a world that barely knows you're alive.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo, who has played the loser role before in a number of indie
movies like ``Palookaville,'' is surprisingly endearing as Billy,
especially since the character is so critical and judgmental of
others.
</P>
<P>
   Writer/director Gallo's intentions are clearly noble in this
offbeat romance about loving in spite of past scars, but he can't
fully pull his ambitious subtext from beneath the quirkiness. In
the end, ``Buffalo 66'' parallels Billy's story by not fulfilling
its potential.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo 66. Directed and written by Vincent Gallo. Cast: Gallo,
Christina Ricci, Anjelica Huston, Ben Gazzara. Lions Gate Films.
110 minutes. Rated R for nudity, language, violence.

ALMOST EVERYTHING WAS THE SAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday July 23)  
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every summer I can remember, I've spent the Fourth of July at my
grandmother's farmhouse in West Virginia, eating homemade banana
ice cream, watching the parade, picking blackberries and counting
fireflies from the porch.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, my children and I flew to West Virginia to carry on
the tradition. But it's no longer my grandmother's farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
   It's ours.
</P>
<P>
   Before my grandmother died in September, she deeded the
homestead to my mother, who promptly transferred it to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to keep it in the family for the children
anyway,'' says my ever-practical mother, who was born and raised on
the farm and has always been amused by my romantic attachment to
the place.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother and I had exactly one conversation about this
before it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big responsibility,'' she told me.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as we pull up the gravel driveway, I look at the rutted
ditches holding water, the peeling paint, the fence that needs
mending and the overgrown garden.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I are in the midst of a move ourselves. With jobs
in transition and our children's college funds in their embryonic
form, we're not in any financial position to take on another home _
however sentimental its value.
</P>
<P>
   But the farm has long been my bedrock, especially during times
of chaos, and just the sight of it reassures me. The red porch
swing, the old crib stacked with firewood, and the stone walkway to
the elm tree are my indicators that all is right with the world.
</P>
<P>
   After four hours spent in airports and on planes, I was ready
for some serenity. Adam and Sarah tumble out of the car, eager to
explore, and I sink onto the familiar couch in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, where we had so many meals of fresh garden corn,
chicken and dumplings, and apple butter on toast. In the pink,
flowered bedroom upstairs, where her necklaces, scarves and old
purses wait for Sarah to play dress-up. And in the cabinet beside
the living room fireplace, where grandma's 1926 high school
yearbook shows that she was its editor. We spend the week much as I
spent my childhood vacations _ watching the holiday fireworks from
rag rugs on a hill side, sitting on hay bales at an auction, buying
a take-home quart at the church ice-cream social.
</P>
<P>
   And we visit grandmother's grave, bringing her Black-eyed Susans
and Queen Anne's lace.
</P>
<P>
   Artificial bouquets already fill the concrete vases, so Adam
places the flowers on top of the headstone. I read aloud the names
and dates engraved in the marble _ Hobart D. Crum, 1897-1979, and
Freda Sayre Crum, 1904-1997.
</P>
<P>
   During last year's visit, grandma had been disappointed that I
hadn't brought my daughter, who was home with the flu. Grandma had
held Sarah the year before, a smiling baby just starting to hold
her head up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the fading light, Sarah plays with her brother in the
pasture behind the cemetery. As we leave, she turns to wave not at
the graves, but at the empty, rolling field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bye-bye, Grandma Freda,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not prone to fanciful thoughts about spirits roaming the
earth, playing guardian angel to loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   But, at that moment, I am almost certain that grandmother is
there, waving back.
</P>

 &HT;    BILL PROPOSES LIFE SENTENCE FOR RAPISTS; DEATH FOR MURDERERS
 &HT;    By DANIELLE SHOOK
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mika Moulton displayed a picture of her 10-year-old
son, Christopher Meyer. Blond hair, a radiant smile, and youthful
innocence caught in a photograph taken just three weeks before he
was abducted.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days after his disappearance from a neighborhood park in
Illinois on Aug. 7, 1995, her murdered son's body _ stabbed 53
times _ was found.
</P>
<P>
   She showed a second snapshot: his grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy and Jeffrey Dahmer are all safe
because they're dead,'' Moulton said, referring to some of the most
notorious murderers of recent history. ``When you have your first
chance, and you mess up, you shouldn't get a second one.''
</P>
<P>
   Moulton joined others whose lives have been touched by vicious
crimes at a news conference Thursday to support a bill calling for
mandatory life sentence without parole for rapists and child
molesters and the death penalty for first-degree murderers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we pass this bill, we will literally save lives,'' said
Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., the bill's sponsor. ``We owe it to every
American to do nothing less.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which Salmon said will be formally introduced next
week, has attracted 22 co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Among those participating in the news conference were Marc
Klaas, father of Polly Klaas, who was abducted from her California
home during a slumber party, and Fred Goldman, father of Ron
Goldman, who stabbed to death along with Nicole Simpson, the wife
of O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Klaas, whose 12-year-old daughter was killed by a Richard Allen
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a career criminal now on death row, said it was ``time to
put our foot down.'' He also said states should be responsible for
paying restitution to victims of paroled criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would make states financially responsible for
restitution if previously released or escaped murderers, rapists,
and child molesters commit similar crimes again. It would provide
$100,000 to the victims of the subsequent attack.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where a rapist or murderer from one state commits a
similar crime in another state, the first state would reimburse the
other state's cost of apprehension, prosecution and incarceration
of the criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon released statistics from the Bureau of Justice Statistics
indicating that the average time served in prison for rapists was 4
years, 9 months and the average time served by murderers was 5
years, 11 months.

WEATHER STATISTICS POINT TO GLOBAL WARMING, SOME EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: At least 25 Texans died in record heat this month.
Flash floods swamped 123 Tennessee homes. And forest fires obscured
the July 4 skies over Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Is global warming for real, after all?
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore says so, basing his conclusion this week
on the latest federal weather data that showed that this June was
the warmest June on record.
</P>
<P>
   Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
revealed that each of the first six months of this year set new
monthly records for global temperatures, measured at the surface.
</P>
<P>
   This follows last year's data that showed the entire year of
1997 was the warmest on record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The latest data showing this June was the warmest month on
record provide more evidence that global warming is real,'' Gore
said at a news conference in Washington. ``And disasters around the
country, like the devastating fires in Florida, show just how
vulnerable we are to extreme weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and other Democrats called Wednesday for more
``common-sense'' strategies to protect future Americans from the
impacts of global climate change.
</P>
<P>
   But others scoff at assertions that the recent weather extremes
are connected to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The World Climate Report, edited by Patrick Michaels, a
University of Virginia climate expert who has expressed skepticism
of global warming, noted in this month's edition that early
explorers marveled at the Florida wildfires _ and that was during
an especially cool period on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the first time that Gore has invoked bathos in
support of his agenda even though his science was completely
wrong,'' the editorial stated. ``Last year, he conflated the North
Dakota flood with global warming, which was actually caused by
excessive snowfall that would be reduced as it warms there.''
</P>
<P>
   As a basis for his position as a global warming-skeptic,
Michaels relies, in part, on satellite temperatures, rather than
surface temperatures. He said those satellite readings show no
dramatic rise in temperature.
</P>
<P>
   But such rhetoric frustrates Daniel Lashof, senior scientist at
the Natural Resources Defense Council, a national environmental
group that supports curbs on the nation's greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Lashof discounted looking at satellite temperatures when there
are only about 20 years of data, pointing out that scientists have
more than 100 years of surface temperature data.
</P>
<P>
   That larger set of data is also more reliable because satellite
technology has changed over the years, while the technique of
reading a temperature at the ground has remained pretty much the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more frustrating, Lashof said, is that the data just
continue to mount _ month after month, year after year, but people
still doubt that global warming is occurring.
</P>
<P>
   To Lashof, it's clear that the planet is getting warmer.
</P>
<P>
   The information from this year``strongly reinforces the
conclusion that global warming is under way,'' Lashof said in an
interview Wednesday. ``What's surprising about the data is that
each individual month sets a record for that month.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it sets it by a considerable margin.''
</P>
<P>
   Among many scientists, it's generally accepted that the globe's
climate is being changed by man's release of millions of tons of
carbon and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   A November 1997 report by climate expert Jerry Mahlman in the
journal Science stated that it's now ``virtually certain'' that man
has induced a warming of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   What's not certain is the impact of that warming. How much will
the temperatures rise and what regions will be affected the most?
And how will variables that scientists can't yet calculate _ such
as increased cloudiness _ alter the impact?
</P>
<P>
   Currently, it's likely that a warming of 2 to 8 degrees
Fahrenheit will occur, Mahlman predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it's not exactly sound science to point to recent weather
extremes as evidence of global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas heat wave, Lashof said, ``is an example of the kind of
problem that is predicted from global warming and the kind of event
we might expect to occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can't point to a specific event and say that is proof
of global warming.''
</P>
<P>
   What's certain is that there have been quite a few of those
extremes of late.
</P>
<P>
   The current drought in the southern and southeastern United
States, which began in March, is the driest April-June period for
Florida, Louisiana, New Mexico and Texas since record keeping began
in these states more than 100 years ago, said David Easterling of
the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   And although it's supposed to be hot in Texas and Florida in
June, it's not normally this hot. In Amarillo, the temperature
topped 100 for 13 days. In Melbourne, Fla., it was above 95 for 24
days.
</P>
<P>
   Such long, hot spells normally have little probability of
occurring. The Amarillo heat wave, for example, would normally
recur only once every 1,000 years, according to the national
climate data center.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the national center's new models of the impacts of
global warming on the United States show that it might soon occur
once every six years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, while some are broiling others are benefiting.
</P>
<P>
   New England enjoyed one of the wettest Junes on record. In the
Midwest, this June was the second wettest. The wettest was in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   Across the globe, land and ocean temperatures also reached an
all-time high in June, the climate data center reported.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures averaged more than 1 degree Fahrenheit above the
average recorded temperature since 1880. The highs were more
evident over land, nearly 2 degrees above average.
</P>
<P>
   This June record also came despite the recent demise of El Nino.
As it has subsided, temperatures in the Central Pacific dropped.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect July to bring much relief _ it is expected to
become the seventh month in a row to become the hottest on record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite possible,'' Lashof said. ``And normally July is the
hottest month of the year, which means it could be the hottest
month of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, that's quite possible.''

WORKERS STUCK IN THE SLICES OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Do you feel like a slice of bologna?
</P>
<P>
   Many workers are learning what it feels like to be in the
sandwich generation. They are sandwiched between caring for aging
parents and not-yet-out-of-the-home children.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, then, that a new study by the nonpartisan business
research organization, The Conference Board, finds that sandwichers
are suffering financially and emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it surprising that their employers are incurring
productivity losses because of sandwich-related work intrusions,
particularly absences. Deborah Parkinson, a Conference Board
research associate, put such losses at $11.4 billion a year. That's
a big but fairly meaningless number, unless you're in the sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   There's no simple way to cope simultaneously with 16-year-olds
and 86-year-olds, college tuition and nursing home fees. But the
study identifies one thing as ``the most valuable corporate program
to help employees deal with their dependent-care needs'' _
flextime.
</P>
<P>
   Flexible hours let employees juggle their work time. With
flextime, sandwichers can respond to family needs without
sacrificing time on the job or income. Surveys repeatedly list
flextime among top ways to retain good workers and among benefits
that employees most desire.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, boomers have entered the ranks of parenthood
and clamored for child-care help from employers. Most didn't get
much help, except for referrals to metropolitan child-care
resources. Now the same employers are being asked to provide
elder-care assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, referrals to outside resources are a beginning, but
probably not enough. Sandwichers say they also need dependent-care
accounts, access to elder-care seminars and counseling, and
long-term insurance that will help pay for the health and
residential needs of ill and aging parents.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons why many employers never provided child-care
assistance was that it was an expensive benefit that a relatively
small percentage of workers needed at any one time. So far, that
may be true of elder-care help, but demographics portend growing
demand.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Americans over age 65 will jump from 34 million in
1995 to 62 million by 2025, the report says. Fortunately, Americans
are living longer in better health, so it's not a given that
workers with aging parents are going to be making daily calls to
the nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're not already a sandwicher, it's a good bet you work
near someone who is. Whether you live it or observe it, it's clear
that caring for the needs of aging parents is a different kind of
stress from caring for your children. For one thing, you're never
as prepared. And, quite often, the learning curve is crammed into a
crisis time frame.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of the reason why the new child- and elder-care
initiatives under way at several Kansas City area workplaces are
worth noting. These employers know they'll get better workers when
those employees have information and resources to help them deal
with family needs.
</P>
<P>
   The companies' investments mean that thousands of Kansas City
area workers are going to be in a more comfortable sandwich. It may
mean the difference between feeling like a slice of bologna and a
cut of Kansas City steak.

THE ROMANTIC COMEDY IS AMUSING BUT ULTIMATELY SUPERFICIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I Think I Do,'' a comedy, is unrated. It contains some mild
language and sexual themes. Running time is 1 hour 40 minutes. Two
and a half out of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   A retooled ``Big Chill'' with gay overtones, ``I Think I Do'' is
an often-amusing romantic comedy that never rises above the level
of pleasant trifle.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Sloan's film begins in the early '90s at George Washington
University, where a group of men and women has been partying
heartily. In scenes encompassing several holiday gatherings during
their senior year, we meet the characters.
</P>
<P>
   Principle among them is Bob (Alexis Arquette), who knows he's
gay but hasn't really done much about it. Problem is, he's in love
with his roommate, Brendan (Christian Maelen), who very well may be
gay but certainly hasn't faced the issue. When the desperate Bob
finally makes his move, he's shot down.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile there's a regular round robin of sexual high jinks
going on. There's a womanizing party boy (Guillermo Diaz), a couple
of gal pals who are romantic rivals for the available men (Marianne
Hagen, Maddie Corman), and monogamous longtime steadies Carol and
Matt (Lauren Velez and Jamie Harrold).
</P>
<P>
   Flash to the present. Carol and Matt finally are tying the knot,
and the old gang reunites for the nuptials. Bob, now a successful
TV writer, shows up with his significant other, Sterling (Tuc
Waters), a soap opera star whose hunkish TV persona conceals an
aspiring Martha Stewart. Bob and Sterling are such a tight duo that
they're even thinking of cementing their relationship with a
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Bob's perplexity, then, when Brendan pops up
acknowledging that, yes, he is gay after all. And would Bob like to
make up for lost time?
</P>
<P>
   Writer//director Sloan dishes superficial characters in
superficial situations, but he has a good sense of humor and in
Arquette he has a sort of nebbishy homosexual Woody Allen hero.
Some of the performances, particularly Waters' affected TV actor,
are very funny. And though the film is clearly aimed at gay
audiences, Sloan gives even the straight characters some juicy if
not quite believable dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, nobody in this film is that believable.

THERE'S NOTHING BEYOND `THE BEYOND' BUT BAD FILM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Beyond,'' a supernatural thriller, is unrated. It contains
graphic violence and gore. Running time is 1 hour 28 minutes. One
out of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of his huge success with ``Pulp Fiction,'' Quentin
Tarantino decided to pay homage to those filmmakers who influenced
him by setting up Rolling Thunder Films, a distribution label
devoted to bringing to audiences quirky titles that received few or
no U.S. bookings on their initial release.
</P>
<P>
   The effort paid off when Rolling Thunder brought back Hong Kong
filmmaker Wong Kar-Wai's ``Chung King Express.'' Alas, Tarantino
now subjects us to ``The Beyond,'' a 1981 horror entry from Italian
goremeister Lucio Fulci.
</P>
<P>
   The late Fulci, a colleague of the better known Dario Argento,
has a cult following, presumably among audiences captivated by
bloody makeup, sadism and really awful acting. ``The Beyond,''
playing as the late show this week at the Tivoli Westport Theatre,
is regarded by some as Fulci's best film. That's a depressing
thought.
</P>
<P>
   The movie starts out in the 1920s when the residents of
Louisiana bayou country rise up to torture to death a warlock
living in a picturesque hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Now, half a century later, the old hotel has been inherited by a
young woman (Catriona MacColl) who hopes to restore it. But it
turns out that the building conceals one of the seven entrances of
hell, and the spirit of the late warlock is still up to mischief,
killing workmen and then animating their corpses.
</P>
<P>
   The film has a mysterious blind girl (Sarah Keller) who
interacts with our heroine but actually doesn't exist, and a
physician (David Warbeck) who doesn't believe in hocus-pocus but is
too dim to figure out that to kill a zombie, you have to shoot it
in the head.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing even vaguely approaching real characterizations
here. (Despite their Anglicized names, most of the cast members are
Italian, and their lines are dubbed in English.) The story is
preposterous, and the scary effects wouldn't alarm a 10-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   At best ``The Beyond'' provides an opportunity for audience
participation in the style of ``Mystery Science Theater 3000.''
Come on down and make up your own dialogue. It's got to be better
than what's on the soundtrack.

ALL-INDIAN FILM SEEMS LOW ON SPIRIT UNTIL POWERFUL END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals,'' a comedy//drama, is rated PG-13 for some
intense images. Running time is 1 hour 29 minutes. Two and a half
out of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   As the first feature film written, directed, produced and almost
exclusively acted by American Indians, ``Smoke Signals'' most
certainly will have a lock on the P.C. crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Question is: Just how good is it as a movie?
</P>
<P>
   For most of its running time, ``Smoke Signals'' impresses as a
thoroughly competent, often amusing but vaguely underwhelming
effort. And yet in the final minutes it achieves a rare power and
resonance quite out of proportion to its otherwise workmanlike
nature.
</P>
<P>
   Just how it achieves this is hard to say _ perhaps through the
accumulation of details and emotional moments that individually
don't mean much but that add up to something affecting.
</P>
<P>
   This easygoing film _ written by novelist Sherman Alexie and
directed by Chris Eyre _ begins on the Coeur d'Alene reservation in
Idaho, where the DJ on the local low-powered radio station greets
listeners with ``It's a good day to be indigenous!'' and a guy
posted out by the highway gives an unusual weather report (``One of
the clouds up there looks like a horse!'').
</P>
<P>
   Our protagonists are cousins who, save for their shared
bloodline, might have come from different planets.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) is a charismatic former high-school
athlete with a chip on his shoulder and a future already running
low on possibilities. Handsome but sullen and unmotivated, Victor
seems destined to fall into a familiar cycle of poverty and
despair.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Builds-the-Fire (Evan Adams), on the other hand, is a
grinning geek with a taste for nerdy three-piece black suits, heavy
eyeglasses and carefully braided hair. Thomas is a born storyteller
who yaps nonstop about tribal and personal history, recycling
age-old legends and dishing new ones of his own invention. If
Victor is a sullen pessimist, Thomas is willingly naive, with a
mischievous sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Victor finds his cousin an irritating pest, but their shared
history binds them together. When both were infants, Thomas'
parents died in a house fire after a night of heavy boozing.
Victor's father, Arnold (Gary Farmer), saved baby Thomas from the
flames. The boys grew up together as neighbors and classmates.
</P>
<P>
   A good chunk of Victor's bad attitude can be traced to his dad
abandoning the family a decade ago and moving off the reservation.
Now word arrives that Arnold has died in Arizona. Victor and Thomas
are dispatched to bring back his ashes.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a road movie about two innocents set loose in a
foreign land _ namely, the U.S.A. The whites they encounter view
the Indian lads with everything from condescension and contempt to
superficial pleasantries; it doesn't help that the suspicious
Victor bites every friendly hand.
</P>
<P>
   He even mistrusts Suzy (Irene Bedard), a fellow Indian and
social worker who befriended Arnold in his last years and now
relates that Victor's alcoholic dad finally kicked the bottle,
straightened up and in his final days achieved a kind of grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals'' is amiable enough, with a good dose of
American Indian humor and an unhurried, drifting style that is easy
to take even as it fritters away much of the drama.

LIGHT TOUCHE CARRIES THE DAY IN `ZORRO' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Mask of Zorro,'' a swashbuckler, is rated PG-13 for
intense action and violence. Running time is 2 hours 11 minutes.
Three out of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   You can try to resist ``The Mask of Zorro,'' but it won't work.
This good-natured if slightly overcooked swashbuckler revives
old-fashioned derring-do and melds it with a post-Indiana Jones
wryness.
</P>
<P>
   Add actor Antonio Banderas in a performance that will most
certainly make him an A-list star, and you've got fine summer fun _
completely lightweight but highly enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   Director Martin Campbell and the screenwriters (Ted Elliott,
Terry Rossio, Randall Jahnson and John Eskow) have come up with an
interesting twist on the legendary caped swordsman of old
California by delivering not one, but two Zorros.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy prologue set in 1821, we see Zorro (played by
Anthony Hopkins and, rather obviously, a stunt man) defeating the
corrupt provincial governor, Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson), and
leading the oppressed peons in a revolt against Spain that marks
the birth of the Mexican nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the wily Don Rafael isn't easily vanquished. Before he
leaves for Spain he orchestrates the capture of Zorro _ whose real
identity is Don Diego de la Vega _ and the death of Zorro's beloved
wife. And he seizes the couple's infant daughter, Elena, to raise
as his own.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 years later, Don Rafael returns to California with plans
to create his own little dictatorship. He brings with him Elena
(Catherine Zeta-Jones), now a spirited and beautiful young woman.
</P>
<P>
   Coinciding with these events is Don Diego's escape from prison
(finally!) and his recruitment of an impetuous young bandit,
Alejandro Murrieta (Banderas). Worn down by 20 years of chains and
whips, Don Diego knows he's no match for Rafael's army. His idea is
to train Alejandro as the new Zorro.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mask of Zorro'' has plenty going on. Too much, in fact.
It's part ``Rocky'' movie (lots of ``training'' sequences), part
``My Fair Lady'' (the proletarian Alejandro must learn how to pass
himself off as a foppish aristocrat), part coy love story
(Alejandro//Zorro and Elena repeatedly cross swords and lips in a
clever dance of seduction and defiance), part ``Lethal Weapon''
flick (huge explosions), part family melodrama (Elena doesn't
realize that the servant ``Bernardo'' is actually her real father).
</P>
<P>
   Nitpickers will find plenty of incongruities. How can Don Diego
come away from two decades of near-starvation with a substantial
middle-aged spread? How do they light those torches placed 20 feet
up a wall? How come some characters speak Spanish-accented English,
others British-accented English, and still others Spanish? What's a
loaded cannon doing inside a soldiers' barracks?
</P>
<P>
   Holding it all together is Banderas, whose impish sense of fun
and bad-boy cockiness provide just the right counterpoint to the
film's heavy-handed handling of political and social events. One of
the film's strengths is that it doesn't take its new Zorro too
seriously _ Alejandro is so eager to get into costume that he dons
the black mask before he's sufficiently skilled, leading to some
very amusing foul-ups involving his horse.
</P>
<P>
   And the stunt guys have done a terrific job, staging stirring
acrobatic sword fights and chases that will no doubt send off an
entirely new generation of kids to turn pillow cases into capes.
</P>
<P>
   If director Campbell, best-known for the James Bond flick
``GoldenEye,'' hasn't quite yet developed the polished
sensibilities of Michael Curtiz (``The Adventures of Robin Hood'')
or even Steven Spielberg (``Raiders of the Lost Ark''), he has come
closer to delivering an old-fashioned Errol Flynn swashbuckler than
anyone else in the past decade.

   WILLARD'S MOM PUSHES FOR AIMEE'S LAW
</P>
<P>
   Eds. note: updated version of Aimee with ACLU criticism of law
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Kane
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 16 -- Gail Willard went from victim to lobbyist
Thursday, walking the halls of Congress in a bid to ensure states
don't release convicted murderers and rapists early.
</P>
<P>
   At a tear-filled press briefing, Willard recounted the horror of
learning that her daughter Aimee had been raped and murdered in
June 1996, only to grow more mortified when she learned that the
alleged killer had already been convicted of murder in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   A little less than two months before the murder trial of Arthur
Bomar begins, Mrs. Willard pushed Congress to pass a ``No Second
Chances'' bill, which its sponsors are calling ``Aimee's law.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bomar had not been given a second chance by Nevada in 1990,
Willard said, her daughter would have gone on to graduate from
George Mason University, where she starred on the lacrosse and
soccer teams. ``Aimee Willard would be alive, teaching, coaching,''
she said, adding, ``Those dreams will never be fulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., was already working on a bill
addressing prison releases when prosecutors charged Bomar with the
murder in 1997, and reports soon showed that Bomar had served just
11 years for murder and was paroled in 1990. The Willard case
``galvanized'' Salmon's staff to write ``Aimee's Law,'' an aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   The law would penalize states that release convicted murderers,
rapists or child molesters if they go on to commit another violent
crime. That state would forfeit up to $100,000 in federal funding
for crime fighting, payable to the victim or the family of the
victim.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in the Willard case, Pennsylvania would be able to tally
up the costs of investigating, prosecuting and jailing Bomar -- if
he is convicted -- and send the bill to the Department of Justice.
The attorney general would then dock that amount of federal funds
from Nevada, and send the money to Pennsylvania, reimbursing the
state and local police.
</P>
<P>
   The real incentive in ``Aimee's Law,'' Salmon said, was to prod
states into drafting policies that would not allow violent sex
offenders and murderers to go free. ``This provides both a carrot
and stick approach,'' he said, citing Department of Justice
statistics that the average time served for convicted rapists is
four years, nine months. Convicted child molesters serve an average
of two years, nine months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years, nine months?'' asked Luis Gonzalez, whose brother,
New Jersey police officer Ippolito ``Lee'' Gonzalez, was gunned
down in 1995 by freed murderer Robert ``Mudman'' Simon, an Upper
Darby native convicted of murdering his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are serving a life sentence of grief and lost loved one,''
Luis Gonzalez said. He mocked Pennsylvania's parole system for
calling Simon a ``model'' prisoner upon his release after serving
12 years for his girlfriend's murder. Within 11 weeks of his
parole, Simon, who is now on ``Death Row'' after pleading guilty,
had killed Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties groups say the law goes too far and that
``one-size-fits-all'' prison sentencing from Washington is
unconstitutional. ``It's a decision that the states should be
making, not the fedearl government,'' said Jenni Gainsborough,
spokeswoman for the National Prison Project of the American Civil
Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Willard, Luis Gonzalez and other victims met with key House
Republican leaders to press for ``Aimee's Law.'' The bill, which
has been endorsed by Reps. Curt Weldon, R-Aston, and Jon Fox,
R-Abington, does not have any Democratic co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   In her lobbying efforts, Gail Willard said it is difficult to
retell Aimee's story, now to a national audience. ``(But) it needs
to be told over and over again,'' she added.

 &HT;    Unwelcome solitude: Alone and adrift in cyberspace trance
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 19: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Virtual Valhalla, a man named Bran Ferren says, is no more than
25 years off. My timing is never good. I can see I'm going to miss
this one, too. In 25 years I'll be retired _ if I'm lucky. Or maybe
even dead, the worst timing of all.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, on second thought, it's just as well.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about something that Bran Ferren calls an
Internet-connection implant. I don't know what exactly this would
be, only that Ferren, who is an executive with Walt Disney
Imagineering, says it would let you hook up to cyberspace without
even turning on your computer. Ferren has anticipated the doubters
and skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why risk it?'' he asked in The New York Times Magazine a few
months ago. ``Well, imagine that you could understand any language,
remember every joke, solve any equation, get the latest news,
balance your checkbook, communicate with others and have
near-instant access to any book ever published without ever having
to leave the privacy of yourself. Not bad.''
</P>
<P>
   There it is, in that third-to-last word: Yourself. Myself. The
Self, sovereign and solipsistic.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing else exists.
</P>
<P>
   An amoeba-like world
</P>
<P>
   As a view of the world, it conforms perfectly to the amoeba-like
inconstancy that Ellen Ullman writes about in ``Close to the
Machine: Technophilia and Its Discontents'' (City Lights Books,
$21.95 hardback, $12.95 paperback). Ullman is as close to a poet as
cyberculture will ever produce. Her prose has a pith and precision
that turns things inside out, exposing the unseen. In Ullman's
hands, virtual reality becomes a trance, its protocols and language
dreamlike, disembodied, disconnected from life. Here, in her
opening paragraph, she locates us in the mind of a programmer
working around the clock:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what time it is. There are no windows in this
office and no clock, only the blinking red LED display of a
microwave, which flashes 12:00, 12:00, 12:00, 12:00. Joel and I
have been programming for days. We have a bug, a stubborn demon of
a bug. So the red pulse no-time feels right, like a read-out of our
brains, which somehow synchronized themselves at the same blink
rate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Close to the Machine'' is one of those books that get by on no
publicity, but somehow find their audience. It deserves a larger
one. As cultural commentary, it is far more telling than Tracy
Kidder's ``The Soul of a New Machine,'' published in the early
1980s. Where Kidder was writing from the outside, the observer
reporting what he saw but not always what he understood, Ullman
writes from the inside. The effects are dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Ullman has been a software engineer for 20 years, a onetime
English major who got sidetracked into an industry ravenous for
smart people who can learn a new language, a new way of thinking
about what is and is not. And then those people find themselves
drifting in an electronic universe. If it's disturbing to read,
it's because Ullman renders that universe so seamlessly. She takes
you into it, and you want out.
</P>
<P>
   Timeless and unmoored
</P>
<P>
   The features of that universe are by now familiar _ the monitor
and the mouse, the cubicle, the sound of clicks. It is a world
without hard ground:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting in my sun-filled, 1,600 square feet of architectural
cool, I felt light-shocked, stunned. The sudden huge quiet unnerved
me. Now I spent my days in the company of machine hum. Now I worked
whenever, got dressed when I had to. Time on the face of the clock
meant less and less as the weeks went by. I was all unmoored again.
My company and my life had devolved to their inevitable essence: me
and my machines.''
</P>
<P>
   The satisfactions of solitude are restorative, a being with
oneself. It is spiritual, yet tethered still to the physical. This
is not what Ullman means. In the electronic cosmology, being itself
loses meaning because it is denied substantiality. Face-to-face
relationships have no more value than e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Ullman, it happens, also wrote an op-ed piece in the Times
recently, less poetic but no less pertinent. What is the point of a
computer science degree, she asked, if the technology is
continually changing? The original programmers, in the years
following World War II, were mathematicians and physicists. Today,
with the demand for programmers far outpacing any normal supply of
mathematicians and physicists, they have been succeeded by tekkies,
uneducated drones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Programmers,'' she wrote, ``seem to be changing the world. It
would be relief, for them and for all of us, if they knew something
about it.''

BONDS, DOLLAR FALL DESPITE SIGNS ECONOMY IS COOLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury securities fell Thursday despite government
reports pointing toward lower economic growth and diminished
inflationary pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Traders attributed the bond market's retreat to a further
decline in the dollar's value and a belief that the effects of the
General Motors Corp. strike had made the latest economic data look
deceptively weak.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar fell to the lowest level against the yen in more than
three weeks on speculation that Japan's next elected prime minister
will support radical bank reform and help rescue the country from
recession. The dollar also fell for the fifth day against the mark
after Russia's Parliament passed austerity measures to secure new
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds have tended to track movements in the dollar's value
lately. A higher dollar attracts foreign investors to assets
denominated in the currency.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 30-year bond slipped 12/32, to a price of 105
21/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to
5.72 percent, from 5.70 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The price weakness came despite government reports showing a
decline of six-tenths of a percent in June industrial production
and a decline of eight-tenths of a percent in factory use to the
lowest level in more than four years. The data suggested the
economy is cooling, which would tend to help bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But economists said the data reflected the mass shutdown of GM
factories caused by a strike at two plants in Flint, Mich., that
began more than a month ago. The reports would have been stronger
without the effects of the labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The GM strike has started to wreak havoc with the economic
data base and market observers are beginning to weave through the
statistical minefield,'' said Donald Fine, the chief market analyst
at Chase Asset Management.

 &HT;    For Reynolds Price, stories `want' to be told
 &HT;    By Teresa K. Weaver
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a society, a region, ``a country of leavers,'' author
Reynolds Price shows a definite propensity toward staying. At age
65, he lives only an hour away from where he was born, in Macon,
N.C., and only 10 minutes away from Duke University, where he's
been teaching since 1958. And 14 years after doctors found a
10-inch-long, pencil-thick tumor on his spinal column, the
silver-haired Price thrives, clearly relishing his role as a master
of contemporary literature.
</P>
<P>
   Price's work is so profoundly grounded in his home territory
that he has spent much of his writing life fending off labels of
``Faulknerian'' or even strictly ``Southern.'' Indeed, his themes
of love vs. independence, a family vs. a life alone, could be set
anywhere. They're usually not, but they could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've tried to do is communicate everything I saw and felt
and thought I knew as clearly as possible _ as close to the truth
as possible,'' Price says in a slow, measured baritone befitting a
natural-born storyteller.
</P>
<P>
   ``My work is about the huge struggle that any thoughtful person
has between love, duty and freedom. How much do you have to
surrender to have a companioned life?'' asks Price, who himself has
never married. ``How much are you prepared to surrender? And what
are you going to do when you find out that you've got a husband and
four kids and it's taken away too much of your freedom?''
</P>
<P>
   Such questions come honestly to Price, whose parental families _
the Prices and the Rodwells _ grappled with the vagaries of human
relationships and the fallout of choices poorly made. Two of his
father's three sisters had disastrous marriages and returned to
live in the family home, each of them bringing a child, never
remarrying, and having to find work in a small Southern town at a
time when women _ at least middle-class white women _ didn't work.
His family also had its share of experience with drink and
depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, part of my fascination with that reality, that
theme of love vs. freedom, comes from my being an only child until
I was 8 years old, and not having a lot of other children to play
with. I was fascinated by, and deeply seduced by, my parents'
social circle, which consisted largely of extended family. And
these people tended to be marvelous talkers and storytellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't leave the adults alone. Even when there were other
children around, I preferred to stay and listen to the adults talk.
Until they ran me off so they could tell a dirty joke. Then I
lurked around a corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps predictably, a solitary boy with a penchant for truth
grows up to be a solitary writer with an unerring ear for detail
and an unwavering delight in the complexities of human character.
The themes, the expressions (``a neck as long as any wet week,'' a
man ``quiet as warm dust under your feet,'' ``alone as a crow on a
dead tree''), the gift of storytelling that is still ``a Southern
thing, if you're in the right part of the South, meaning off an
interstate'' _ all those things were laid down early in life as
major sources, major resources.
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist of Price's critically acclaimed novel ``Kate
Vaiden'' (1986) was based loosely on his mother, Elizabeth Rodwell
Price, a loyal and loving woman in whom he always detected an
``outlaw spirit.'' His only other first-person female voice is
found in his latest novel, ``Roxanna Slade.'' Roxanna is based,
again loosely, on his mother and her older sister, Price's Aunt Ida
Drake.
</P>
<P>
   Both Roxanna and Kate are products of the small-town South, and
both are strong women.
</P>
<P>
   But Kate, the orphaned survivor of her parents' murder-suicide,
spends her life running, first from her infant son, and eventually
from one place to another, from one man to many others. Roxanna
never leaves, straying from traditional female roles _ sister,
wife, daughter-in-law and mother _ only figuratively, with a
terrifying breakdown and her own brand of emotional detachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The miracle is, you can last through time.''
</P>
<P>
   _``Kate Vaiden'' (1986)
</P>
<P>
   Price is a great conversationalist, as comfortable with words as
his characters are with dialogue. He is cursed, he swears, with
``this fatal Southern liking to talk to people.'' In Atlanta
recently near the end of a 16-city tour promoting ``Roxanna
Slade,'' he speaks easily and elegantly in the rhythm of a natural
poet, in the mesmerizing cadence of a lifelong North Carolinian.
Conversation is peppered with thoughtful pauses and passing
references to a circle of beloved friends ranging from Eudora Welty
to Polly ``Kiss My Grits'' Holliday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is so revered,'' says Thom Bales, community relations
coordinator for Borders Books &AMP; Music in Atlanta, where Price read
to about 75 spellbound readers. ``The tone of the audience was so
quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   In a comfortable pace his readers know well, Price will talk
about almost anything _ about the South as a setting and a cultural
phenomenon, about teachers as ``awesome beings'' and about his
life's work.
</P>
<P>
   In conversation, he refers to characters from his novels as if
they are lifelong friends or perhaps ne'er-do-well relatives. He
admits he ``fell in love'' with two of his creations: the
unattached and unattainable Polly Drewry in ``The Surface of
Earth'' (1975) and ``The Source of Light'' (1981), and Blue
Calhoun, the title character in his 1992 novel about a middle-aged
man's adulterous affair with a 16-year-old child-molestation
victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Blue and Polly are outlaws. For complicated reasons, they
simply don't buy the standards and moral and ethical and domestic
imperatives of their culture, which is small-town Southern
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Outlaws are universal, Price insists. Both stories could have
been set anywhere, conceivably far outside the South. They could
have been, but they're not.
</P>
<P>
   In his travels, Price continually encounters readers who know
nothing of the South, who may never even have set foot in the
South, yet they understand his work. ``They really get it,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   There does still exist, in Price's view, a tangible, definable
South, despite urbanization and the transient nature of
20th-century society. His definition of that South, though, is far
from romantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that has ever been truly unique about the South
is still under way,'' he says. ``Even those of us who are
Southerners immediately start thinking of the weather, cooking,
Christianity, the King James Bible, music, front porches, etc.,
when we try to describe the South. And a lot of that does seem
imperiled, especially if you live in Atlanta or Charlotte or
Raleigh-Durham or any other metropolitan area. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think the only thing that the South has that some other
region doesn't have ... is three centuries plus, ongoing, of
incredible intimacy between two very different races. That is still
very much with us.
</P>
<P>
   ``And with all the horrors like the recent episode in Texas (in
which three white men allegedly tortured and killed a black man
because of his race), and all the huge inequities that continue to
exist, I'm very proud to say we know a hell of a lot more about
segregation and integration than any other part of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember what you see and save it up for me.''
</P>
<P>
   _Polly Drewry in ``The Surface of Earth'' (1975)
</P>
<P>
   Thanks partly to the computer age (no more drafting chapters by
hand) and partly to confinement in a wheelchair (a renewed sense of
discipline), Price's creative output since 1984 is twice what it
was in the two decades before that _ not that he was exactly
slothful before. Since his first novel, ``A Long and Happy Life,''
was published in 1962, he has written 11 novels, two volumes of
memoirs, two collections of short stories, a study of the Gospels
and four collections of poems, along with assorted plays,
screenplays, essays and even song lyrics. His work has appeared in
16 languages.
</P>
<P>
   He spends eight hours a day, six days a week in his office at
the house in the pines outside Durham, where he has lived since
1965. Before his paralysis, Price lived alone. Since, he has
learned to rely on a live-in companion _ usually a former Duke
student, who commits to a yearlong arrangement _ to help with the
rituals of everyday life that a paraplegic cannot take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Price is not given to self-pity, nor to sharing intimate details
of his life. But after his ``cancer crisis'' 14 years ago, he wrote
``A Whole New Life,'' a slender, selfless account that continues to
resonate with readers everywhere he goes. Four years of surgeries,
radiation treatments and drugs left him cancer-free but in a
wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every book signing now, without fail, somebody will turn up
with an interesting story that goes with their having read the
book,'' he says. ``A man came up to me in Washington, D.C., last
night and said his wife had just recently died. And even when she
was so sick she couldn't get out of bed, she wanted him to keep
reading her passages from that book.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses. ``Three weeks ago in L.A., a woman who looked like a
trustworthy person _ she seemed to be telling the truth _ described
herself as being a tormented clinical depressive and said that book
saved her life. She said it saved her life.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses again. ``I'll take that,'' he says. Some rewards of a
life spent writing are more poignant than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pretty much have to be driven to be a writer. You've got
to want to have kind of a weird life. ... People always ask me what
I tell young writers. And truthfully, the first thing I tell them
is: Quit if you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Tyler and Josephine Humphreys are two of Price's former
students who couldn't quit. Both went on to become as famous as
their teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best,'' Humphreys says simply. ``He was the
handsomest man any of us had ever seen. He really was extraordinary
looking, with his dark hair and dark eyes. And he was the funniest
man, which always helps in teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best teachers have a kind of magic. They're not like
normal people. ... I think there were two things in particular that
all of us students latched on to. First, he's a genius with the
language. He can put words together in ways that no other living
person can. And he's had a huge influence on the Southern style of
fiction with his wordsmithing. He makes real poetry out of it, and
we all wanted to learn the secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, he has a great deal of insight into the human heart,''
Humphreys adds. ``He taught us that writing is not just about
words. Writing is always an effort to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stories are something I'm better at than life.''
</P>
<P>
   _``Blue Calhoun'' (1992)
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing is simply some hard-wired part of my nature,'' Price
insists. ``It's the only thing I was ever any good at. And I knew
it since I was 16 years old. I just keep doing it, and it keeps
wanting to be done. It really is as mysterious and unexamined as
that. I don't look at it too hard for fear it might go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Chappell, a fellow North Carolina poet and novelist who was
a freshman at Duke when Price was a senior, remembers the
upperclassman ``looking very much like a young Orson Welles'' and
ultimately ``worrying about looking like an old Orson Welles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was someone roughly my age who was the most urbane, the
most polished, knowledgeable person I knew,'' Chappell says. ``And
despite the physical problems, he remains more or less that same
person. Even as a young man, he always had a confidence that he
would be the Reynolds Price that we know today.''
</P>
<P>
   Price still teaches at Duke one semester a year: a
near-legendary course on John Milton and either ``Advanced
Narrative Writing'' for seniors and graduate students or a course
on the Gospels of Mark and John.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to fight really hard not to do the old graybeard thing
_ `you know, back in my day' _ because I really try to remember
with bald realism,'' Price says. ``That was by no means a golden
age of literacy and classical education, but we certainly had some
complicated opportunities that are fairly unavailable today. For
instance, it was very standard for a child to take two or three
years of Latin, and virtually everybody I knew studied foreign
languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's most different today in students' lives is not
so much the level of educational preparation as it is that most
boring of all villains: television. That, I'm convinced, is the
major difference between students now and even students when I
began teaching in 1958. They spend such a phenomenal amount of time
in front of television, from infancy on, that their imaginations
may as well have been surgically removed.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how he ultimately wants to be remembered _ as a
successful writer or a good teacher _ Price is slow to answer,
obviously reluctant to choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the beginning, writing and teaching have always been
paired in my life. ... I've taught about 2,000 people. Some of them
will remember me as long as they live, and some of them will tell
their children about me. After that, the teaching part of my life
will vanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The books, I hope, will be around for another few millennia.''

 &HT;    `Private Ryan' first to hit the beach as WWII rages again
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 19: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The no-nonsense Army captain still looks a tad Forrest Gumpish,
the Iowa farm boy he's helping to rescue is actually Hollywood's
latest ``It'' boy, and the only shots that really count here are
being captured on 70 mm film.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when ``Saving Private Ryan'' marches into theaters
nationwide Friday _ complete with its harrowingly realistic battle
scenes, inspiringly patriotic themes and a platoon full of highly
decorated performers _ moviegoers may have to blink hard to
convince themselves World War II's not happening all over again.
</P>
<P>
   In a way it is. The war that saved humanity, preserved democracy
and, not coincidentally, spawned more movies than any other
conflict in history is at it again. Indeed, Steven Spielberg's
hugely hyped ``Saving Private Ryan'' is just the opening salvo in a
fusillade of upcoming films set in or around World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Besides getting to relive D-Day in ``Private Ryan'' _ directed
by Spielberg and starring Oscar winners Tom Hanks and Matt Damon _
moviegoers soon can revisit the battlefields of Guadalcanal,
courtesy of John Travolta, George Clooney and Nick Nolte in ``The
Thin Red Line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more coincidental than anything else,'' said ``Thin Red
Line'' producer John Roberdeau. ``People are simultaneously drawn
to the same thing and you get these cycles going.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, some one dozen World War II-themed movies are either
``in the can or in active development,'' according to the industry
bible, The Hollywood Reporter. They range from a French romantic
adventure (``Spoils of War'') to a Philippine fighting epic (``The
Emperor's General'').
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget ``Hogan's Heroes.'' Paramount Pictures last
month optioned the rights to the hit '60s sitcom set in a German
prisoner-of-war camp (now in syndication on cable's TV Land).
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``the last great war'' (as historians and ``Private
Ryan's'' publicity materials frequently dub World War II) is the
next big thing well beyond movie screens. HBO recently broadcast
``When Trumpets Fade,'' about an American soldier who is his
company's lone survivor of 1944's Battle of Hurtgen Forest. Next
month, A&AMP;E will premiere ``More Great Escapes of World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   On the publishing front, Hyperion Books in May paid an
undisclosed six-figure sum for the rights to Jefferson native Damon
J. Gause's dramatic account of his escape from a Japanese prison
camp in the Philippines during World War II. Historian Stephen E.
Ambrose's ``Citizen Soldiers,'' spent several months on the
best-seller lists earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose traces the current explosion of interest in World War II
to several factors, including nostalgia for a time when
``individuals made a difference'' and the realization that the
war's aging veterans won't be around much longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But bigger than either of those is that we as a nation are
yearning for heroes,'' said Ambrose, a historical consultant on
``Private Ryan.'' ``We don't have any. And we don't live in heroic
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor do we live at a time when the issues seem as clearly
delineated as they were during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the forces of good and they were the forces of evil,''
said Western Michigan University professor Lewis H. Carlson about a
plot line with eternal appeal. ``We still like morality plays
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanks suggested that's why World War II movies have once again
supplanted other wars,
</P>
<P>
   such as Vietnam, as popular
</P>
<P>
   subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is, Vietnam was a place of questionable morals
and motives,'' Hanks said while in Atlanta last week with Spielberg
promoting the movie. ``And in World War II, the Nazis were evil.
They had to be conquered.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, few World War II veterans tended to open up
about their experiences, said Carlson, who published an oral
history of former POWs last year. Even those who did approached the
subject much like movies at the time: The stories were heavy on
honor, even humor, and light on horror.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the 51-year-old Spielberg says he grew up a ``war movie
fanatic.'' As a teenager, he used an 8 mm camera to try and capture
the spirit of the tales of his father, a veteran, about Americans'
combat heroics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If World War II is undergoing a revival, it may be that people
would rather see films about a war that has a point than films
about a war that many Americans have or had great doubts about,''
said Geoffrey Cocks, an Albion College professor who teaches a
course on Film Images of World War II. ``At least World War II was
for a good cause.''
</P>
<P>
   During Vietnam, the public saw the battlefield presented
unvarnished on daily TV newscasts. The war movies being churned out
in Hollywood became less patriotic than cynical or tragic in tone
(``Platoon,'' ``Apocalypse Now''). Yet by the Gulf War, Cocks says,
the U.S. government had ``learned the Vietnam lesson. There was
very carefully controlled (media) access and the picture presented
back home was very sanitized.''
</P>
<P>
   All the more the reason, perhaps, for our revived interest in
the last great war. And at least now, Spielberg said last week, the
focus is where it should be _ on the men who served at the front,
not behind Hollywood cameras or Washington desks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I chose to tell it from the level of the sand as
opposed to the level of the camera crane up 45 feet and showing all
the spectacle of thousands of GI's hitting the beach,'' Spielberg
said quietly, sounding quite unlike that teen with an 8 mm camera
and romantic notions of war. ``I didn't want to tell that story,
because that was a Hollywood version of World War II. I wanted to
tell the veterans' version of World War II.''

   KID _ Like thousands of other kids, 12-year-old Nathan Adams
arrived at Busch Stadium in St. Louis last Sunday hoping for a
souvenir. He left with the ball that became Mark McGwire's 39th
home run.In the first inning, McGwire couldn't quite reach the left
field bleachers, where Adams sat. The ball landed in the Houston
Astros bullpen, then bounced onto the field, where an Astro gloved
it and flipped it into the crowd. As Adams reached for the ball, so
did an adult fan. (McClelland, Dayton Daily News) ETA 8 p.m. ET.

   SHARP-DRIVING _ ATLANTA -- It was like a brief trip into
automotive heaven. As a driving enthusiast, the mere mention of the
German autobahns has been like a vision of sugarplums dancing in my
head. It truly was Christmas in July during a trip to Germany. For
me, it was the ultimate treat. Traveling at speeds in excess of 110
mph, our little 170-horsepower Saab sprinted happily along, once
even legally passing a police car. What a rush! The system seems so
sensible, and it's difficult to argue its logic. Not once in more
than 600 miles of driving did I see a single accident or a tinge of
animosity between drivers. If only we could make it work on our far
superior interstate highway system. (Sharp, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MECHANIC _ ATLANTA -- Gasoline is a hot topic these days. Three
readers have fuel-related questions, two about fuel quality and one
about gas stations. Let's tackle the confusion about fuel first.
David Harris writes: ``I take excellent care of our three cars
(change the oil every 2,500 miles, etc.), but I buy the cheapest
gasoline I can find. How do I determine which fuel is a
good-quality fuel?'' (Carter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

 &HT;    On a picnic, it's the atmosphere that matters, not the food
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My New York editor friend, Larry Ashmead, clearly thinks I am a
nut about picnics. And, of course, he is right.
</P>
<P>
   I come from a long line of women, even old ladies in their 80s,
who often said, ``Let's take dinner and go to the woods.'' Our
theory is that whatever you have to eat tastes better under the
open sky, and ants in the cake and sand in the salad never bothered
one of us a whit.
</P>
<P>
   Larry probably remembers to his distress the time I walked him
and two other visitors from New York, Walter Mathews and Mary
Hedges, a couple of weary miles to our beloved Johnson's rock over
by Little River. (Try to find the rock now. Subdivisions have
obliterated the old wagon trail to it.) We spread our dinner on the
rock, which juts out of the hill overlooking the river, with blue
peaks of the mountains edging woods and sky beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The food wasn't notable. I don't remember what the four of us
toted to the rock, but it was probably fried chicken, potato salad,
pimento cheese sandwiches and iced tea. I didn't know there was
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Now I know better. Larry has sent me from a British publication,
Country Life, a piece about the kind of picnics the stylish boating
crowd put on over there. His little note says, ``For your next
picnic _ choux puffs with trout pate, stuffed boned duck and
raspberry hazelnut meringue. Or maybe cherry clafoutis.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I think a really good picnic warrants the best food you
can come up with _ but what's wrong with fried chicken and pimento
cheese sandwiches? Of course, I haven't tried choux puffs with
trout pate or stuffed boned duck, but I'm willing to give them a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that I have a very elegant picnic basket, which
Larry and Walter gave me after the weary walk to Johnson's rock. It
came from Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, and it has plates and cups and
saucers, and knives and forks, and even a couple of small thermos
jugs. It's a lovely thing, and I have used it often, on less
distinguished picnics.
</P>
<P>
   My grandchildren charitably remember walks to Johnson's rock
when the cupboard was bare, and we made do with honey and butter
sandwiches and apples.
</P>
<P>
   One of the boys, now grown and about to get married, said
wistfully the other night, ``Do you ever make honey and butter
sandwiches and walk to the river any more?''
</P>
<P>
   To my shame, I haven't, since I tried to find the road to the
rock and found it blocked by a truckload of garbage, old mattresses
and springs and decaying baby furniture. It's enough to discourage
the most indefatigable picnicker.
</P>
<P>
   However, my neighbor Betsy Hastings, who rides to the rock on
her horse, has promised to show me the new way.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, I'll get to work on something boned and
stuffed, and maybe a basket of quail eggs dipped in celery salt and
nestling in chicory leaves with mangos and smoked chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could be like that picnic I planned for some guests at the
beach. I was packing the picnic basket, and had planned to haul the
group a couple of miles down the Gulf beach, when a delegation
called on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you mind,'' they began hesitantly, ``if we didn't go
down the beach and just ate here on the porch?''

 &HT;    Everything's fair game in no-holds barred `Mary'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rude, crude and hilarious, this comedy by the ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber''
team of Peter and Bobby Farrelly definitely isn't a family film.
Ben Stiller plays Ted, a nerdy high school senior who suffers a
very particular bathroom mishap that keeps him from attending his
prom with the class golden girl (Cameron Diaz). Thirteen years
later, the still-obsessed Ted hires a lower-rung gumshoe (Matt
Dillon) to track her down.
</P>
<P>
   Be forewarned: ``Something About Mary'' hits as many sacred cows
as possible: the physically challenged, the mentally challenged,
little yappy dogs, and people with skin conditions. But at least,
in the movie's sickest, funniest scene, the hair gel that one
character uses is cruelty-free.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is liberating in its scatological, slapstick way. But
the easy-to-offend should find something more polite to watch.
Which would be just about anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Something About Mary''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cameron Diaz, Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon. Directed by
Peter and Bobby Farrelly. Rated R for strong comic sexual content
(including glimpses of fake mangled genitalia and rubber breasts)
and language. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 58 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: In your face and very funny.

 &HT;    `Mary' revels in cruelty jokes, perverse humor
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Preston Sturges' classic ``Sullivan's Travels,'' the
wandering movie director played by Joel McCrea tries to switch from
comedies to serious ``issue'' films, but winds up learning to value
his own gift for making audiences laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber'' team of Peter and Bobby Farrelly aren't
exactly Sturges. After all, he didn't traffic in jokes about
everything good, bad or disgusting that can go in or out of a human
body. But in their exuberant, democratically offensive fashion, the
brothers (also responsible for ``Kingpin'') have a knack for making
you laugh helplessly. And that's a gift.
</P>
<P>
   Be forewarned: ``There's Something About Mary'' isn't a family
film. The politically correct, beware. The movie hits as many
sacred cows as possible: the physically challenged, the mentally
challenged, little yappy dogs and people with skin conditions. But
at least in the movie's sickest, funniest scene, the hair gel one
character uses is cruelty-free.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the film's cheery tone makes its comic assaults seem
like a twisted salute to American diversity. As a people, we come
in all shapes, sizes and degrees of skin burn, and the Farrellys
seem committed to give every one the comic once-over.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but what's the movie about? Ben Stiller plays Ted, whom we
meet as a high school senior, infatuated with Mary (Cameron Diaz).
She's the untouchable class golden girl. So imagine his surprise
when she invites him to the prom. And his mortification when a very
particular bathroom mishap keeps him from ever reaching the dance
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years later, Ted is still obsessed with Mary. So he
hires a lower-rung gumshoe named Healy (Matt Dillon) to track her
down. She turns out to be living in Miami, still gorgeous, still
single and a surgeon. Which is why Healy decides to woo Mary
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The ``something'' Mary has _ and Diaz makes us believe it _ is
the ability to make just about every man fall for her. Especially
the worst men, like Healy, or a pizza boy who, like the private
eye, will stop at no lie or crass stunt to have her.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the fun in the movie is its riffs and comic bits. So the
less said, the better. The Farrellys know how to set up a joke,
build on it a few scenes later and then make it pay off in one
loud, rude funny way one last time.
</P>
<P>
   And they give the movie its own romance-comedy aura, trotting
out singer Jonathan Richman and drummer Tommy Larkins to give the
audience musical updates of the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Stiller does his patented schlemiel bit; after ``Flirting With
Disaster'' and ``Zero Effect,'' it's become his pigeonhole, but he
does it well. Dillon revels in the hidden rot beneath his
character's mock-suave exterior. And while she's a glowing
presence, it's a shame that Diaz, a gifted comedien, has to play a
character so perfect that she never gets a chance to go screwball,
like all the male cast members.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Something About Mary'' isn't the cookie-cutter
Hollywood romance you're used to. That's a recommendation, and a
warning. It's liberating in its scatological, slapstick way. But
the easy-to-offend should find something more polite to watch.
Which would be just about anything.

 &HT;    Black Rock up to the challenge
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The times Greg Tate is recalling could be right now.
There was resistance from audiences to certain kinds of black
instrumental music, especially experimental guitar-oriented music.
And there was resistance from black and white divisions of record
labels to signing this kind of music.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1985. And one of the few major differences between
now and then is the Black Rock Coalition, which Tate co-founded
that year. ``We just banded together to correct that situation in a
proactive way,'' says Tate, 40, a Village Voice columnist and the
author of ``Fly Boy in the Buttermilk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of complaining about what the labels weren't doing, we
decided to be our own kind of industry within the industry. Put out
our own records. Put on our shows. And just create situations where
we challenged the audience to want and expect more.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a gradual process, Tate concedes. A lot of what the
BRC has done is within the popular music vein, taking on Sly and
the Family Stone, Prince, Curtis Mayfield and even Stevie Wonder at
the last National Black Arts Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``But don't get it wrong; we've never been a cover band,'' adds
Vernon Reid, a co-founder of the BRC and the now-defunct Living
Colour. ``We make the individuality of the band members very
pronounced and just use a particular artist's music as a starting
point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's just time for this kind of challenge,'' continues
Tate. ``I feel that what Max Roach was doing as a drummer presaged
drum and bass. And his collaborations with Abbey Lincoln were very
much about addressing the political and social situations of
African people in the world. They were fearless about having a
political agenda inside of jazz. Something like `We Insist' is as
bold as anything in hip-hop when you think about the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And when you think about this time, he adds, such boldness is
still necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Max &AMP; Abbey Conversion in a Jungle Style''
</P>
<P>
   10 tonight. Presented by the Black Rock Coalition. Variety
Playhouse, Atlanta $18. 1-888-836-6223.

 &HT;    Yes, Stickney's funny _ just think about it
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray

<P>
   ATLANTA -- Walking out of comedian-actress Phyllis Yvonne
Stickney's one-woman show, you may think that what you just heard
wasn't funny.
</P>
<P>
   Black people who have ``lost their funk chasing that dollar.''
The near-prostitute-like image of prominent rap stars such as Lil'
Kim. The way black people discriminate against one another because
of their skin color and hair texture.
</P>
<P>
   What had you doubled over with laughter about any of that?
</P>
<P>
   Well, you might realize that what you were laughing at is the
reflection of yourself in Stickney's fun house mirror. Or you might
not have been one of those people Stickney talks about who creates
his own words (``lookeded'' ``'fose to''), but you've heard it
enough to recognize it. So you applaud in affirmation.
</P>
<P>
   With the sharp insight of a more personal Chris Rock, the
curator of the National Black Arts Festival's performance arts
program offers up an affecting form of ``edu-tainment,'' as she
calls it. It's part comedy, part poetry, part audience
participation, with a whole lot of her inspiring personal story.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're watching a masterpiece in the making,'' claims
Stickney, who has appeared in ``The Women of Brewster Place,''
``New Jack City,'' ``Malcolm X'' and the upcoming movie adaptation
of Terry McMillan's ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And being onstage is my therapy.''

 &HT;    Spielberg: `I thought I knew what war was'
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 19: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the unexplored realms of extraterrestrial existence to the
unspeakable horrors of the Holocaust, Academy Award-winning
director Steven Spielberg has been known for tackling immense
topics throughout his 26-year career. Yet his latest film may be
his most personally oriented ``big'' film. In ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' Spielberg turns his vision on World War II. In an interview
last week, Spielberg shared his thoughts on war, war movies,
personal courage and a career spent directing everything from
mechanical sharks to the geisha girls who will be the focus of his
next project.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Q:There have been all sorts of theories about your supposed
inspiration for doing this movie. So what was it, really?
</P>
<P>
   A:I wish I did have the idea for the movie, but I read a
completed screenplay by Robert Rodat. It had been given to me by my
agency, who knew I was looking to tell a story about World War II
and had been for years.
</P>
<P>
   I was compelled very much by the morality play at the center of
``Private Ryan.'' But I certainly think that Rodat drew his
inspiration from the stories of brothers who have died in combat,
from the Civil War to the Sullivan brothers (five brothers who died
on the U.S. cruiser Juneau in 1942) _ which was probably the
biggest blow the home front ever took during the war ... and later
on there was the Niland family, who lost two out of four sons and a
minister was sent out into the field to search for the (remaining)
brothers for 10 days before finding them.
</P>
<P>
   Q:One of the things you're being credited for in ``Saving
Private Ryan'' is making one of the first ``realistic'' movies
about World War II. How would you characterize your earlier
efforts?
</P>
<P>
   A:Well, if that's what I'm credited for in this film, then (in)
my first films, I would have been credited for romanticizing war.
You know, making war a paradise for war lovers!
</P>
<P>
   And that's sort of what propaganda films did in the 1940s _ to
help with recruitment, to sell war bonds and to make people back
home feel that their sons were dying for a good cause.
</P>
<P>
   So I was only a creature of habit. I was a kid growing up in
Arizona, and on TV when I was growing up, there were two choices:
Westerns and war movies. And I hated horses, so I watched the war
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Q:So what's next, your western?
</P>
<P>
   A:(Laughing) You're not going to see my western for a long time,
no!
</P>
<P>
   Q:So did a time finally come in your life when you wanted to set
the record straight on WWII?
</P>
<P>
   A:Oh yes, it happened to me _ it happened to all of us. I'm 51,
so I guess I'm the Vietnam generation. I was (classified) 1A before
the lottery. I had a high lottery number, which is the only reason
I didn't go to Vietnam. I took the Army physical in the induction
center and was one month away from getting the ``greetings'' letter
when the lottery was inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
   But I think what changed my mind from the glory movies of the
1940s and '50s was seeing the casualties from the Vietnam War on TV
seven nights a week, over and over and over again. You know, Dan
Rather and Mike Wallace literally out there in the field with their
microphones, on their hands and knees, showing triage of these guys
screaming their lungs out. And I'm in college at the time. A lot of
us were talking about going to Vietnam and suddenly I'm of draft
age, and it's all we thought about.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Since you were so close to being drafted, would you have gone
to Vietnam?
</P>
<P>
   A:Yes. Yes, definitely I would have gone. I would've been too
scared not to. Because then, I did not have the courage of my
convictions _ to have protested the war by leaving the country. I
would have served my country, although I would have been unhappy,
because I didn't agree with that war. But I would have gone anyway.
A lot of guys went into that war who didn't want to fight that war.
They fought and they died. It was something they had to do.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Still, was there ever a point while you were making ``Saving
Private Ryan'' when you said to yourself, ``I only thought I
understood what war was all about?''
</P>
<P>
   A:Yes. I was knocked off my perch every day. I thought I knew
what war was, because who's been teaching me war all my life but
the movies? But when I began to make this picture, I realized, ``My
God, I've been learning from the wrong people.'' The people who
really should have been teaching me (about) war over all those
years were the veterans of those wars _ of Vietnam, Korea and World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Q:You put your actors through a mini-boot camp before filming
began. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A:I was trying to teach them to respect soldiering. You can't
put any individual through five to six days of basic training and
expect them to be soldiers. It takes three to four months to make a
soldier. But I thought six days was better than no time spent
learning how to respect the people they were about to portray. To
me, it was about teaching them respect more than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Stephen Ambrose (the renowned World War II historian who
served as an adviser on the film) says D-Day's soldiers got to
confront the question every man wonders about himself _ ``Am I a
coward?'' What situation in your own life similarly tested your
personal bravery?
</P>
<P>
   A:I think that the biggest test of courage in my life was
deciding to direct ``Schindler's List.'' Because I was terrified. I
was terrified that I wasn't enough of a filmmaker, enough of a
human being. Or I was afraid I didn't possess the qualifications
necessary to acquit that event in history and to give honor, not
shame, to the survivors of the Shoah.
</P>
<P>
   I felt that had I told the story wrong _ had it been too
melodramatic, too sentimentalized, which I have an inclination
toward anyway _ that I would have brought shame to a subject that
is already, you know, regarded by many debunkers and deniers as
never having happened. And if I had made a mistake with that story
I would have unwittingly contributed to the side that says, ``See,
it's not real after all. It never really happened.''
</P>
<P>
   And so that was probably the scariest decision I ever made. And
it wasn't to do with my career _ (with) making another choice to
direct just another movie. This was an event that could only go in
two directions.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Are your kids going to see ``Saving Private Ryan''?
</P>
<P>
   A:My kids are not going to see it, no. Because it's too graphic.
It's too realistic, and I just don't want my kids being exposed to
this right now.
</P>
<P>
   I think 15 years old is even a gray area. But I think once you
get your learner's permit _ once you can drive a car and see those
``Death on the Highway'' videos they show you, and then once you
can actually serve in the Army _ that's my cutoff age.
</P>
<P>
   But I think people should just be warned that it is not a movie
that glorifies or glamorizes war. It's a movie that tells to the
best of my ability _ with all the actual consultants I had on this
picture, with all the people who were veterans of the war _ it's
just the best job I could do of telling their story. And therefore,
this might not be a film for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Who do you hope goes to see this movie?
</P>
<P>
   A:Well, I hope that people who don't know very much about World
War II will go to see it and understand what it was like, you know,
for the kids who created the baby boomers. I hope people will see
the movie and understand, were it not for that generation _ my
dad's generation, or some of our grandparents' generation _ there
wouldn't be a baby boomer generation and therefore there wouldn't
be a Generation X. That that's how critical in terms of a seminal
moment of the last 100 years that war was for the world.
</P>
<P>
   And I hope veterans will see it. But I don't expect veterans
will see it anymore than the Holocaust survivors saw ``Schindler's
List.'' Most of the Holocaust survivors would not go to see
``Schindler's List'' because the memory of their existence in those
camps was still too current. And I expect that, even though I
really feel I made this movie for the veterans _ as a memorial to
the veterans who didn't come back and, as I say, as a kind of grand
overture of gratitude to those who fought that war and won it. I
expect very few of those veterans will allow themselves that
experience, especially when they read that it's realistic. But
that's who I hope will see the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Has your father seen the movie yet?
</P>
<P>
   A:No, he's seeing it next week.
</P>
<P>
   Q:As one of those vets, did he have to be convinced to see it?
</P>
<P>
   A:No, not at all. He gave me a lot of help on this movie. A
couple of scenes that are in the movie came from my father. ... My
dad will see it because my dad wasn't in combat on the ground. He
was in B-25s in Burma. So he had a different experience. So I think
the ground experience (depicted in the film) will be OK for him.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Since you brought up ``Schindler's List'' earlier, a lot of
people are wondering if ``Saving Private Ryan'' is a companion
piece to that. Do the two films have anything to do with each other
in your mind?
</P>
<P>
   A:No, nothing. I don't even consider the Holocaust part of World
War II. I think the Holocaust was a ... you know, was just a
monstrous evil that would have happened with or without America's
intervention in the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Maybe that's a case of people now looking at your movies in
terms of them being ``the next Steven Spielberg film.'' Do you ever
think back to those days when you could just make a movie like
``E.T.'' because you wanted to, or, maybe in the case of ``Jaws,''
because someone hired you to. ...
</P>
<P>
   A:That was basically it, too! ``Jaws'' was a good job!
</P>
<P>
   Q:Do you ever miss those days?
</P>
<P>
   A:Not at all, and I'm not influenced by it either. I'm not
influenced to try to tell the kind of stories that people either
are hoping I'll tell or expecting me to tell. Because if I did
that, I would simply be dishonest to my own needs.
</P>
<P>
   You know, I'm making a movie in January that I couldn't have
conceived of making until I read this book _ ``Memoirs of a
Geisha.'' I couldn't have conceived of going to Kyoto and making a
geisha movie, are you crazy? When (studio executive) Lucy Fisher
called me and sent me the book, I didn't even read it for a month.
But when I read that book, I said, ``Oh, my God!''
</P>
<P>
   So I need to be open to that kind of influence _ not the
influence of trying to second-guess what the pundits want me to
make next, what might be right for me to make next.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What attracted you to ``Memoirs of a Geisha'' (a first-person
narrative of a Japanese girl sold into the slavery of a geisha
house)?
</P>
<P>
   A:I am so attracted to that wonderful competitive attitude
between the two geisha houses and (the characters) Sayuri and
Pumpkin. And I love Hatsumomo _ she's the greatest villainess since
Cruella De Vil! I just can't wait to get my chops around this
thing!
</P>
<P>
   Q:So you'll be working with a lot of women on this film?
</P>
<P>
   A:All women and all Asians. There are no Americans, no
Westerners in this film.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Won't that be quite a switch from ``Private Ryan,'' which
except for a few opening scenes, has virtually no female
characters?
</P>
<P>
   A:I think women are involved in this movie to a great degree. I
think there is the ghost of motherhood that sort of haunts every
frame of this picture. Because that's why they're saving Private
Ryan, or attempting to, and that's where they want to send him if
they do manage to save him. So I think that American motherhood is
completely a very strong component that runs all through this
picture. But in a sense right now what I'm drawn most to is a men's
movie, because I've just come out of what became a kind of male
bonding experience. I mean, I really bonded with those guys. We've
already had a couple of reunions. The whole cast, Tom, myself _
we've already gotten together and had some cigars, some drinks and
a nice steak dinner. And literally told our war stories, reminisced
about the experience of making ``Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Q:Speaking of that, were you ever envious of the men in that
``Private Ryan'' platoon?
</P>
<P>
   A:I envied them to the point that I wore a Ranger jacket to work
every day. And I wore fatigues and I wound up picking up a terrible
habit, which is that I began smoking these dumb things. (Spielberg
pulled a short, stubby cigar from his shirt pocket.) Actually I
haven't smoked one in a long time. But on the movie ... gosh, some
of the guys smoked cigars and we were on the field of battle, and I
was smoking cigars with the guys.
</P>
<P>
   So yeah, I envied them. I still wear my dog tags (Spielberg
reached inside his shirt and pulled out a set of authentic military
dog tags hanging around his neck.) These are actual dog tags that
were minted in 1942. Every single soldier in ``Saving Private
Ryan'' wears a dog tag that was minted in the 1940s and was given
to us as a gift from the government. And it has the name, not the
name of the character _ some of them did, but (some) wanted their
real names on them.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What's on yours?
</P>
<P>
   A:My name. I am my own character anyway!

WOODS IN TIE FOR FIRST IN BRITISH OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ As the winds subsided and the sun broke
through clouds over the Lancashire coast by the Irish Sea, Tiger
Woods stepped to the front of the opening round of Thursday's 127th
British Open at Royal Birkdale. The American phenom gave an early
hint that he might be ready to assert his considerable presence at
golf's oldest championship. Make no mistake about it, Woods was
hitting on all cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   He had arrived in Ireland last week to fish and play a few
relaxing rounds on the great links courses of Ballybunion and
Waterville, and the pressures he felt a year ago at Royal Troon in
Scotland as the reigning _ and runaway _ Masters champion seemed to
be ancient history. ``It's just learning to play golf,'' said
Woods. ``It's an evolution process I think every player goes
through. I'm no exception.''
</P>
<P>
   At Royal Troon, Woods had a quadruple bogey and two triple
bogeys cluttering his opening-round scorecard. He was wild.
Thursday, he was controlled, hitting a 2-iron tee shot on the
457-yard par-4 eighth and a sand wedge to within 40 feet of the pin
and two-putted. ``I think by coming over a week early has always
helped me in the past in the Scottish Open twice as an amateur,''
said Woods. ``We fished all the time over in Ireland. Unfortunately
the golf got in the way of the fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods's chance for sole possession of the lead evaporated on the
18th hole when his 8-iron second shot went over the green and he
lipped out a par putt from 8 feet. This brought him home at
5-under, (30-35_65) and in a tie with John Huston (34-31_65). They
were one in front of Nick Price, Fred Couples, and defending
Pleasant Valley champion Loren Roberts and two ahead of Rhode
Island's Brad Faxon, PGA Championship winner Davis Love, Vijay
Singh, Sweden's Fredrik Jacobson, and Australia's Robert Allenby.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Leonard, who closed with a majestic 65 to triumph last
year at Royal Troon, painted himself in an early corner with a 73
that was marred by a double bogey on the par-4 13th. ``I'm
disappointed to shoot 3-over on a day when you know there's very
good scores out there,'' Leonard said. ``It's disappointing. I hit
the ball OK in spots, but the bad far overshadows the good today. I
just hit it in some bad places.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who stunned the golf world when he won the Masters by 12
shots at the age of 21, has struggled in subsequent major
championships and his best finish was joint eighth at Augusta
National this year. He was not struggling Thursday. On the 411-yard
ninth he pulled out his driver and split the fairway, then hit a
sand wedge to within 6 feet to set up a birdie. ``To me it makes no
sense to lay up,'' Woods said, ``when I can carry the bunker and
put it right on the green. There's no rough down there. The whole
key to it was to get it up and ride the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Huston in the opening-round hunt isn't
surprising, and he showed in Hawaii this year he can shoot low
numbers, firing a PGA Tour record 28-under 260. Huston closed with
an eagle on 17, sinking a 40-foot putt, and then dropped a 4-foot
birdie putt on 18. After an even-par 34 going out, Huston birdied
the 10th (8-iron, 6 feet), 11th (6-iron, 12 feet), and 12th
(6-iron, 8 feet). ``That sort of jump started my round,'' said
Huston.
</P>
<P>
   Huston, who holed out from the 18th fairway to lead the first
round of the Masters two years ago, has been bothered by tendinitis
and bursitis. At the start of the year he began sleeping on a
magnetic mattress. ``I've been sleeping on it. I travel with it,
and it seems to really help. It's a mattress cover, and it has
little magnets all throughout it. It feels like a bumpy mattress.''
</P>
<P>
   Price won the PGA Championship twice (1992, 1994) during a hot
streak when he was one of the game's dominant players; he won this
tournament four years ago at Turnberry. Thursday, he played what he
felt was a perfect round except for two shots that set up bogeys on
the first and 10th holes. ``They were the only two greens I missed
today,'' said Price. ``The biggest problem over the last six months
is I haven't putted solidly. I felt today I was starting the ball
on line.''
</P>
<P>
   The round for Couples could have been better, but it could have
been worse. He salvaged it with eagle putt the par-5 15th, but then
yanked his drive into heavy trouble on the par-55 17th and wound up
with a par instead of looking at a birdie on a reachable hole. ``I
feel like I'm very close to playing like I did,'' said Couples,
``when every time I went out I felt I was going to win.''

 &HT;    Take a more global view with these works from other lands
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 19: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no frigate like a book to take us lands away,'' poet
Emily Dickinson wrote. Maybe so, but even as the U.S. economy
becomes more global, our literature becomes less so.
</P>
<P>
   New York Times reporter Martin Arnold recently explored the
migrations of books across oceans and found that fewer foreign
translations are published in this country now than three or four
decades ago. ``Americans have become isolated from a literary point
of view compared to the '50s and '60s when there were lots of
translations here, of Sartre and Beckett and so forth,'' Richard
Seaver, co-publisher of Arcade Publishing, told Arnold. Today a
translated book usually sells only 3,000 to 6,000 copies, and few
publishing houses are interested. Industry people also cite
American discomfort with foreign languages and the lack of review
attention as reasons for the dearth.
</P>
<P>
   The United States tends to export more fiction than it imports,
even when imports are originally written in English. For example,
10 U.S. authors were listed among the 40 top fiction and nonfiction
best sellers in a recent London Sunday Times. The same sample from
the New York Times Book Review included only four titles by
English-writing non-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, few U.S.-born novelists, traditionally urged to
write about what they know, venture to set novels in other
countries; memoirs and biographies are more often the source of
foreign settings. Still, for readers who hunger to be taken to
other lands, there are some fine recent novels:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Once Upon the River Love.'' By Andrei Makine. Translated
from French by Geoffrey Strachan. Arcade. $24.95. 209 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Makine's ``Dreams of My Russian Summers'' (1997), winner
of two French prizes, was a masterful Proustian view of
contemporary Russia. In this earlier novel, Makine returns to 1970s
Russia in a coming-of-age tale about three boys caught in ``the
pendulum'' of Russian history. Their identities are forged by the
River Amur (Love): Utkin is crippled when he is caught in its ice
floes; Samurai barely escapes a gang rape on its shores; and the
narrator discovers his sexuality when he emerges from a swim. But
when they travel 20 miles over the frozen steppes to see a
Jean-Paul Belmondo movie in Nerlug, they are so altered that they
return 17 times. In the Red October Theatre, located ``between the
squat building of the local militia and KGB and the Communard
factory, where they manufactured the barbed wire that went to all
the camps in that region of Siberia,'' the boys glimpse a vision of
the West. The narrator imagines a mysterious, train-traveling
Western Woman, who is less an erotic fantasy than the embodiment of
the right to imagine and create. Ultimately, the three young men
travel to ironic futures. The narrator turns to filmmaking; Samurai
becomes a merchant marine; and Utkin, a would-be poet, moves to the
United States, where he discovers that empty prose is ``the deathly
ivy closing in on the West. The ivy of words that has killed
life.'' The only bad thing about this novel is that it ends.
Readers can look forward to Makine's next translated work in 1999.
His words are far from deathly ivy; rather, they are the river of
life, and, of course, love.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Way I Found Her.'' By Rose Tremain. Farrar, Straus &AMP;
Giroux. $25. 359 pages.
</P>
<P>
   A teenage boy also narrates this fine work from Rose Tremain, a
British writer best known for ``Restoration,'' which was nominated
for the Booker Prize. The object of Lewis Little's affection is the
Russian-born Valentina Gavril, a popular medieval romance writer.
Lewis and his mother, a translator, leave Britain to spend the
summer in Paris working with Valentina. Lewis becomes acquainted
with an existentialist roofer, a floor-polishing maid from Benin
and a Russian historian crazy over Valentina, who is plagiarizing
his books since she has run out of ideas. Suddenly, Valentina
disappears and Lewis discovers that the French police are not of
the same caliber as Porphiry Petrovich, the detective in
Dostoyevsky's ``Crime and Punishment.'' Lewis uses language and
world literature to hunt for the woman he adores. Though it is
difficult to accept the narrator's precocity, and the ending is
grim, this book lingers in the memory like a good European
vacation.

   -- ``The Iron Tracks.'' By Aharon Appelfeld. Translated from the
Hebrew by Jeffrey M. Green. Schocken. $21. 195 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Aharon Appelfeld's world is far more grim than Tremain's, but
just as compelling. His latest translated novel, originally
published in 1991 in Jerusalem where he lives, examines forgiveness
and revenge by distilling the effects of the Holocaust into the
life of Erwin Siegelbaum. Siegelbaum's Communist parents were
killed in a Nazi camp that he barely survived. After liberation, he
spends 40 years riding the trains of Austria on a set schedule,
ostensibly trading in Jewish religious artifacts. He sleeps at inns
mostly run by Jews, romances women travelers and fights depression
with drink. He also practices shooting his pistol, because his real
business is looking for Nachtigel, the Nazi who killed his parents.
The action he takes when he confronts his nemesis makes for a
skewed, unsatisfactory ending. But the novel of conscience poses
immense questions: Can we forgive genocide? Should we?

   -- ``The Snake Charmer.'' By Sanjay Nigam. Morrow. $22. 223
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Indian-born Sanjay Nigam, now a physician and medical researcher
at Harvard University, has written a gem of a fairy tale located in
modern Delhi. Though Sonalal is a great snake charmer, he is poor,
lacking the respect of wife or sons. One day, he takes his beloved
cobra Raju, and a new gourd that makes exquisite music, to play for
the tourists at Humayn's Tomb. It is an enchanted performance,
until, in front of foreign journalists, Raju stings Sonalal.
Sonalal then chomps Raju in two, resulting in global headlines:
``Snake Charmer Bites Cobra Back.'' Sonalal suffers enormous guilt.
He seeks salvation with an almost mythic prostitute, a quack doctor
who diagnoses everyone as homosexual, and old magicians. After his
sons refuse to become charmers and his friends die, he feels death
stalking him, too. When his second snake bites him, he no longer
can retaliate. Sonalal, though despairing over his toothless life,
remembers the day he played to the gods, the day Raju died. Nigam's
tale is as seductive as the charmer's music, the cobra's dance.

   -- ``Cubana: Contemporary Fiction by Cuban Women.'' Edited by
Mirta Yanez. Translated by Dick Cluster and Cindy Schuster. Beacon.
$24. 213 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Woolf may have called upon women to find a room of
their own, but as Ruth Behar writes in her forward: ``In Cuba
housing is terribly scarce. Most of the contributors to this book
live with more than one generation of their families and writing is
done amid the ever-present interruptions from relatives and
friends.'' These 16 uneven stories mostly tell of a reality so
removed from our own that they are difficult to assess. Some of the
tales provide their own context. In ``Internal Monologue on a
Corner in Havana,'' Josefina de Diego writes in the voice of an
economist-turned-street-vendor, trying to sell her cigarettes for
food: ``To smoke or to eat, that is the question.'' Most Norte
Americanos will have no trouble grasping the ironies of
Cuban-American author Achy Obejas' ``We Came All the Way From Cuba
So You Could Dress Like This?'' And in Nancy Alonso's ``A Tooth for
a Tooth,'' a gift of eggs from an old political enemy is both a
taunt and a treasure. But other stories are seen through a glass
darkly. Still, for readers who want to enhance their knowledge of
Cuban literature, this is an important book to keep and reread as
other collections are published.

   -- ``Ahmed's Revenge.'' By Richard Wiley. Random House. $23.95.
320 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Wiley teaches fiction writing at the University of
Nevada, Las Vegas, but he has lived and worked in Japan, Korea,
Nigeria and Kenya, locales that serve his prize-winning fiction
well. ``Ahmed's Revenge'' evokes a modern-ironic version of Isak
Dinesen. Nora Grant and her Canadian husband, Julius, run a coffee
farm in Kenya in the 1970s; when he is hideously murdered, she too
is endangered. She learns that Julius and her father, a former
minister of wildlife, have sold acrylic ivory tusks on the black
market, and now the Kikuyu ``Mr. Smith'' wants what Julius has
stolen _ or else. Nora, who doesn't know what was stolen or where
it is, enlists the help of Detective Mubia, who may or may not be
two-faced; Miro, a Nairobi opera singer; Ralph Bunche Road, owner
of a Kenyan tour company; and her father, who has written an
inaccurate book on elephants. And elephants _ particularly Ahmed,
the national symbol _ are at the heart of the mystery. As Nora
atones for the sins of father and husband, she learns cultural
respect and renegotiates life. This is a fearlessly imagined and
incredibly novel novel, noteworthy as well for its male author's
success in adopting a female voice.

<P>
   Armageddon PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The world, interpreted as a video game. While ``Deep Impact''
treated a similar let's-save-Earth story with sobriety,
``Armageddon'' never lets the threat of global annihilation get in
the way of fun. It's a space-cowboy movie, with Bruce Willis and
Ben Affleck saving the world for Liv Tyler. As a summer popcorn
movie, it's more enjoyable than that big-lizard flick ``Godzilla.''
And you'll see the reported $165 million budget onscreen in the
impressive effects and mammoth sets. But is the movie good for you?
Probably not. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi disaster action, implied sex
and profanity. 2 hours, 24 minutes. (SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Bulworth R
</P>
<P>
   Provocative, funny, and unbalanced _ just like politics.
Director, star and co-writer Warren Beatty plays the titular
senator from California, who breaks down while watching his latest
re-election commercials. Hiring a hit-man with himself as the
target, he returns to campaigning, where his meltdown becomes very
public. Rated R for profanity. 1 hour, 48 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Can't Hardly Wait PG-13
</P>
<P>
   You won't want to wait . . . for the movie to end. This teen
comedy about an end-of-the-school-year all-night party shirks
subtlety whenever a broad stroke will get us there faster. Jennifer
Love Hewitt plays Amanda, the goddess of the just-graduated senior
class. Ethan Embry is the sweet, sensitive guy who, the movie tries
to convince us, deserves to be her boyfriend. Rated PG-13 for
profanity, simulated sex, drug and alcohol use. 1 hour, 38 minutes.
(SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   City of Angels PG-13
</P>
<P>
   In this Hollywood-style adaptation of Wim Wender's great film
``Wings of Desire,'' Nicolas Cage plays an angel who wants to trade
in his wings for an earthly fling with a comely heart surgeon (Meg
Ryan). Directed by Brad Silberling (``Casper''). (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Cousin Bette R
</P>
<P>
   Balzac's 1846 novel may have been whittled down, but there's
still much to like about this deliciously tart comedy of
ill-manners and worse morals that slowly ripens into a revenger's
tragicomedy. Jessica Lange stars as the overlooked and
underestimated spinster who devises some elaborate revenge
scenarios for her shallow, wealthy relatives. The artful supporting
cast includes Elisabeth Shue and Bob Hoskins. Rated R for sex and
nudity. 1 hour, 48 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Deep Impact PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The impact here is human, which is pretty gutsy since, going in,
we all know this is about a giant comet hurtling toward Earth.
Director Mimi Leder harks back to 1959's ``On the Beach'' in her
determination to show that worldwide catastrophes can be measured
one human life at a time. Her strong cast is headed by Tea Leoni,
Morgan Freeman, Elijah Wood and Robert Duvall. Rated PG-13 for
violence, language and end-of-the-world jitters. 2 hours, 3
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Dirty Work PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Laughless comedy starring an insufferably smug Norm Macdonald,
the comic who was booted from his slot as ``Weekend Update'' anchor
on ``Saturday Night Live.'' MacDonald plays an allegedly charming
prankster who launches a revenge-for-hire business. Rated PG-13 for
language and comic nudity. 1 hour, 35 minutes. (Newhouse News
Service) Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dolittle PG-13
</P>
<P>
   This raucous but uninspired Eddie Murphy vehicle has almost
nothing to do with the old Rex Harrison musical. Murphy is John
Dolittle, a busy doctor who has neglected his wife (Kristen Wilson)
and his two daughters. One day, all kinds of animals start
pestering him vocally. Despite the zing of some nuttier moments,
the lame plot keeps dragging the movie to the ground. Rated PG-13
for crude humor and language. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Everest NR
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' This
44-minute documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm
that killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' Cameraman David Breashears
fills the screen with awesome vistas, but discreetly avoids the
piles of discarded oxygen tanks, human waste and frozen bodies that
now litter the trails of the mountain. This is a film whose cruel
beauty manages to celebrate the spirit of the climbers, while
making you question their sanity. (SM) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas R
</P>
<P>
   Too much is never enough for both fabled gonzo journalist,
Hunter S. Thompson, and filmmaker Terry Gilliam. Thus Gilliam's
version of Thompson's 1971 book about his drug-drenched visit to
Vegas has a brilliant first hour and an excessive second one. But
Johnny Depp gives an amazing, uncompromised performance as
Thompson. Rated R for vulgar language, violence and extensive drug
use. 2 hours. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Godzilla PG-13
</P>
<P>
   He's back. He's big. He's boring. There was probably no way
Hollywood's extravagant update of ``Godzilla'' could live up to its
year-long hype. What's depressing is how far it falls short from
being even solid summer escapism. Bikini Atoll resident Godzilla
comes to nest in Manhattan when it's time to think of family
matters. Matthew Broderick is a biologist on the monster's trail.
Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action/violence. 2 hours, 19 minutes. (SM)
Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Hav Plenty R
</P>
<P>
   Plays like the first draft of what might have been a good
comedy. Writer-director-star Christopher Scott Cherot is Lee
Plenty. Dateless on New Year's Eve he happily accepts an invitation
to a party from his friend Havilland (Chenoa Maxwell), whom he
secretly adores. Cherot is a likable performer, but he doesn't have
the movie star wattage his role needs. Rated R for language. 1
hour, 32 minutes. (SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   He Got Game R
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee gets it together in this celebration/expose of high
school hoop dreams. Denzel Washington is a jailbird dad who could
earn a reduced sentence if he can convince his hot-prospect son
(Milwaukee Bucks guard Ray Allen) to play for the governor's alma
mater. Not a slam-dunk, but close enough. Rated R for sex, nudity
and language. 2 hours, 10 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   High Art R
</P>
<P>
   Former Brat Packer Ally Sheedy gives us a stunning lesson in the
high art of acting as a once-famous photographer who becomes
involved, both personally and professionally, with an ambitious
young editor (Radha Mitchell) at a chi-chi manhattan magazine. In
the film's pivotal role, Sheedy is all wired intensity and wary
irony. Rated R for language, drug use, nudity and sex. 1 hour, 42
minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Hope Floats PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Never flies, but never sinks either. Sandra Bullock teams up
with director Forest Whitaker (``Waiting to Exhale'') for this
affecting story of a woman who goes back to her small-town home to
lick her wounds after her husband has an affair. Also stars Harry
Connick Jr. and Gena Rowlands. Rated PG-13 for language and illicit
kissing. 1 hour, 54 minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The Horse Whisperer PG-13
</P>
<P>
   There are far worse ways to pass the time than riding the range
with Robert Redford. In this old-fashioned, emotionally satisfying
story, the director/star plays a cowboy whose magic way with horses
has a healing effect on humans, too. Also stars Kristin Scott
Thomas. Rated PG-13 for violence and sex. 2 hours, 48 minutes. (ER)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Kurt and Courtney NR
</P>
<P>
   A flawed but fascinating documentary about the death of
Nirvana's Kurt Cobain and the transformation of his widow, Courtney
Love, from grunge queen to satin-swathed movie star. Trouble is,
one can't talk and the other won't. So filmmaker Nick Broomfield
fills in the blanks with assorted misfits, hangers-on,
Courtney-haters and conspiracy theorists (she had Kurt killed).
There's too much time spent in Jerry Springer territory, but the
overall effect is hard to shake. Not rated but there is vulgar
language and references to drug and alcohol. 1 hour, 35 minutes.
(ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Lethal Weapon 4 R
</P>
<P>
   The latest in director Richard Donner's cheerfully chaotic
blow-em-up series re-pairs Mel Gibson's hothead cop Riggs, and
Danny Glover's long-suffering partner Murtaugh. Shaggy and amiable,
Number 4 hardly bothers to get its real plot going for its first
hour. More than ever, the film is an excuse to give its crack
supporting cast, including Joe Pesci and Chris Rock, a series of
comic riffs. Rated R for violence and profanity. 2 hours, 5
minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Lost in Space PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A movie that has all the flash and depth of the latest Nintendo
game. Based on the campy '60s TV show, ``Lost in Space'' throws in
vicious space spiders, genetic monsters, confusing time-travel
elements and heavy doses of family values. There's also Gary Oldman
as the evil Dr. Smith, and ``Friends'' hunk Matt LeBlanc as the
arrogant pilot Major West. Predictably, the movie has an open
ending, suitable for sequels. Rated PG-13 for intense sci-fi
action. 2 hours. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Madeline PG
</P>
<P>
   A remarkably faithful and fun adaptation of the beloved series
of children's books about a precocious red-headed orphan living in
a girls' school. Set in the relatively uncomplicated 1950s and
breathtakingly filmed in Paris, it's fast-paced enough to appeal to
kids (even little boys should take to the motor scooter-riding
rascal Pepito) and just nostalgic enough for adults. Rated PG for
comic violence. 1 hour, 29 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Man in the Iron Mask PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Swashbuckling escapism at its best. Leonardo DiCaprio plays dual
(and dueling) roles in this adventure based on the Dumas novel
about a masked youth, imprisoned by his twin brother, King Louis
XIV and aided by the Musketeers (Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich,
Gerard Depardieu, Gabriel Byrne). Written and directed by Randall
Wallace (``Braveheart''), the movie isn't just for Leo-maniacs; it
has a fine streak of aging-legend melancholy, too. 2 hours, 7
minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The Mask of Zorro PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Derring-do done right. Our men in black are Anthony Hopkins and
Antonio Banderas who double our swashbuckling pleasure and double
our fun as dual Zorros, saving California and Hopkins' beautful,
spirited daughter (stunning newcomer, Catherine Zeta-Jones) from
the evil schemes of one Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson). It's an expert
blend of panache, romaticism and supple, tongue-in-cheek humor.
Rated PG-13 for violence. 2 hours, 16 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Mulan G
</P>
<P>
   The best Disney animated feature since ``Beauty and the Beast''
and ``The Lion King.'' Based on a 4th-century legend, it's about a
young girl who pulls a National Velvet, i.e., disguises herself as
a boy and goes to battle in her elderly father's place. This isn't
just a grand family film; it's a grand film, period. As Eddie
Murphy's little red dragon says, ``Mulan, you the man!'' 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The Opposite of Sex R
</P>
<P>
   Christina Ricci's teen tart burns across the screen in this
acerbic yet strangely sweet black comedy. The convoluted plot kicks
off when Ricci visits her gay half-brother (Martin Donovan) and
steals his dim-bulb lover (Ivan Sergei). The eclectic (and fine)
supporting cast includes Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Rated R for
vulgar language, sexual situations, some nudity and sexual
references. 1 hour, 40 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Out of Sight R
</P>
<P>
   Another winning adaptation of a book by Elmore Leonard, the
brain that cooked up ``Get Shorty.'' George Clooney plays a courtly
bank robber, Jennifer Lopez is the federal marshal he kidnaps. In
outline, this is a screwball romantic comedy. It just happens to be
propelled by firepower, betrayal, bloodshed _ and the erotic
gravitational pull between the two leads. Rated R for language. 2
hours, 9 minutes. (SM) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Paulie PG
</P>
<P>
   A solid, sweet kid flick. Paulie is a wisecracking parrot (voice
by Jay Mohr of ``Picture Perfect'') who is separated from his
beloved owner, a 5-year-old girl named Marie. The bulk of the movie
is Paulie's picaresque adventures as he goes from one owner to
another, trying to find his way back. ``Paulie'' doesn't have the
magic or emotional depth of ``Babe,'' but it's well-crafted and
provides an ending with a lovely twist that can appeal to kids and
adults alike. Rated PG for brief mild language. 1 hour, 27 minutes.
(SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   A Perfect Murder R
</P>
<P>
   Not perfect, this ``Dial M for Murder'' remake is still a guilty
pleasure, a slick B-movie jazzed up with great clothes, art
direction and decent plot twists. Michael Douglas plays a business
shark whose boom is going bust, so he attempts to hire his wealthy
wife's lover to kill her. Rated R for language, sex and violence. 1
hour, 47 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Quest for Camelot G
</P>
<P>
   This action-packed animated feature is a kid-pleaser with enough
humorous asides to keep adults interested, too. During the time of
King Arthur, a plucky girl dreams of becoming a knight and finds
herself responsible for saving Camelot. Gary Oldman, Don Rickles
and Eric Idle are among the more recognizable voices. 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Six Days, Seven Nights PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Think ``Romancing the Stone'' ... only without the romance or
the adventure. Harrison Ford is a gruff charter pilot and Anne
Heche is a New York magazine editor. They wind up stranded on an
island near Tahiti _ an abandoned place, except for some pirates.
The pair bicker, bond and kick some pirate butt. Rated PG-13 for
sexual entendres and implied sex. 1 hour, 41 minutes. (SM) Grade:
C+
</P>
<P>
   Smoke Signals PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A bittersweet coming-of-age comedy about two Native Americans
who leave their dilapidated reservation to go to Arizona to fetch
their father's (one biological; the other spiritual) body. Rambling
and rough around the edges, with a honed casualness that suggests
the early '70s, Chris Eyre's debut film is still definitely worth a
look. Rated PG-13 for vulgar language and alcohol abuse. 1 hour, 30
minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish Prisoner PG
</P>
<P>
   More fiendish fun 'n' games with David Mamet. A naive young
inventor (Campbell Scott) is the patsy/hero in a complex confidence
game. Steve Martin is surprisingly good as a well-connected but
mysterious businessman who befriends him. An insubstantial but
deliciously entertaining scam of a movie. Rated PG for language and
mild violence. 1 hour, 52 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Spice World PG
</P>
<P>
   If they're good enough for Nelson Mandela and Prince Harry, then
they're certainly good enough for us mere mortals. Director Bob
Spiers (``Absolutely Fabulous'') focuses on a few frenzied but fun
days in the life of the Spice Girls as they gallop from concerts to
recording sessions to press appearances. It's a bubble-gum movie _
snappy, colorful and instantly disposable. And perfect for its
intended pre-teen audience. Rated PG for very mild violence and
sexual innuendo. 1 hour, 33 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Suicide Kings R
</P>
<P>
   A retired hood (Christopher Walken) is kidnapped by some rich
kids (led by Henry Thomas and Jay Mohr) who hope his connections
can help them recover Thomas' kidnapped sister. The overly
schematic script begins to circle in on itself, becoming
claustrophobic and predictable. But Walken is terrific, bringing a
wry humor and an intimidating temper to his down-but-hardly-out
mobster. Rated R for language and violent situations. 1 hour, 47
minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   There's Something About Mary R
</P>
<P>
   Rude, crude and hilarious, this comedy by the ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber''
team of Peter and Bobby Farrelly definitely isn't a family film.
Ben Stiller plays Ted, a nerdy high school senior who suffers a
very particular bathroom mishap that keeps him from attending his
prom with the class golden girl (Cameron Diaz). Thirteen years
later, the still-obsessed Ted hires a lower-rung gumshoe (Matt
Dillon) to track her down. The movie is liberating in its
scatological, slapstick way. But the easy-to-offend should find
something more polite to watch. Rated R for strong comic sexual
content and language. 1 hour, 58 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The Truman Show PG
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey's excellent performance is the centerpiece of this
provocative, thoroughly entertaining social satire about a cheerful
insurance salesman who slowly realizes his entire life has been a
TV show and everyone he knows are actors. Peter Weir directs this
dazzlingly executed conceit and the strong cast includes Laura
Linney and Ed Harris. Rated PG for mild language. 1 hour, 44
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Marshals PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lee Jones returns as U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard in this fine
sequel to ``The Fugitive.'' This time, Gerard's on the trail of an
ex-CIA operative implicated in two murders, played by Wesley
Snipes. While this installment lacks some of the emotional
resonance of the original, it offers an exhilaratingly detailed
look into what it takes to be a fed _ the stakeouts, the video
surveillance, the occasional rooftop runs. Through it all, Jones
attacks his role like a pit bull. He makes single-mindedness seem
like a superhuman trait. Rated PG-13 for violence and language. 2
hours, 11 minutes. (DH) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Whatever R
</P>
<P>
   A painfully earnest, overlong look at a teen girl's rites of
passage. Writer-director Susan Skoog tells the story of Anna
(newcomer Liza Weil), a New Jersey girl who, upon graduating from
high school, decides to cut loose a little. Skoog fills the movie
with party scenes, driving home the point of the kids' aimless
drinking and drugging. But ``Dazed and Confused'' covered the same
territory better, with more humor and honesty. Rated R for drug and
alcohol use, profanity, sex and violence. 1 hour, 52 minutes. (SM)
Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   The X-Files PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Bigger but not really better. Though the feature film
continuation of Fox's conspiracy-mad TV series offers more gore and
profanity, it never accelerates to that stratospheric level of
action, suspense or awe that we hope for in a summer movie. As FBI
agents Mulder and Scully, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson take
a smooth step up from television to the big screen. Rated PG-13 for
mild language, gore and violence. 2 hours, 2 minutes. (SM) Grade:
B-

 &HT;    Grown-up Schroder ready to give his all for `NYPD Blue'
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pasadena, Calif. _ Rick Schroder knows the knocks.
</P>
<P>
   He knows he would not have been the first choice of ``NYPD
Blue'' fans to replace Jimmy Smits this fall, or the second, third
or 1,000th. Knows he still takes ridicule for his child star past,
in the 1979 movie ``The Champ'' and the '80s NBC sitcom ``Silver
Spoons,'' and for changing his name from Ricky to Rick.
</P>
<P>
   Now all he has to do is hold his own against Dennis Franz, the
three-time Emmy winner whose Detective Andy Sipowicz is the show's
anchor, and who will be partnered with Schroder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to go in there and earn my place on the show,''
Schroder says with confidence during Thursday's press briefing for
TV critics meeting here to preview the new fall season. ``They
wanted somebody who would not be intimidated by Dennis Franz, and I
went in (to the audition) thinking I have to stand up for myself
and not let Dennis intimidate me.''
</P>
<P>
   And apparently he succeeded. ``He's young but he's not a boy,''
says the cop drama's co-creator, Steven Bochco. ``He's a man. We
look for the best actors we can find, and this was the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt we had something that clicked,'' says Franz, giving his
imprimatur to the controversial casting decision. ``Rick has an
honesty. I didn't see any pretending, I didn't see any acting.''
</P>
<P>
   But still. Rick Schroder, the winsome little wimp from ``Silver
Spoons,'' mixing it up in the urban grit with Sipowicz and all
those low-life perps? Icky Ricky?
</P>
<P>
   For those whose minds are perpetually on mental rerun, Schroder
is 28, married and the father of three, raising his family on a
ranch in Colorado. He has a blond crew cut, and while he won't pass
for the toughest guy on the block, he probably doesn't get carded
in bars these days. He hasn't made the perfect transition from
child star to adult that, say, Jodie Foster has, but he did get
generally good notices 10 years ago when he had a key supporting
role in ``Lonesome Dove.''
</P>
<P>
   That was also about the time his agent suggested he change his
name on credits from Ricky to Rick. ``People started making fun of
it,'' he says, adding that at least once he dissed them back. ``It
took on a life of its own, but it really doesn't bother me,'' he
says. ``My mom and my wife call me Ricky.''
</P>
<P>
   The child star legacy, he's not quite so blithe about. ``It's
been a struggle, but all good things are a struggle. That's what's
made me who I am today.''
</P>
<P>
   Just who he'll be on ``NYPD'' is still pretty much a mystery.
His character hasn't even been named yet. The working plan is for
Smits, who wanted other acting opportunities (and has a development
deal for a new ABC series) to do the first six episodes; his
character, Bobby Simone, will not be killed off. Schroder, playing
a newcomer whose gold shield is still shiny, will be partnered with
Sipowicz, a vet who sometimes struggles with burnout. (Kim Delaney,
who plays Detective Diane Russell, Simone's new wife, will
continue, but Bochco and co-creator David Milch are mum about how
that'll work.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to offer a lot of opportunities to go in a new
direction, to kick him in the butt and take him under my wing,''
says Franz, although he admits he's guessing, since Bochco and
Milch have not yet figured out Schroder's character.
</P>
<P>
   One thing he'll be, very occasionally, is partly naked, in one
of the series' trademark rear shots. And Schroder knows that there
the comparisons with Smits may be the unkindest of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tall, dark and handsome,'' says Schroder. ``I'm short,
blond and skinny.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my wife says I have a great one.''

 &HT;    Giddyup and go to Saratoga: New York destination offers more
than just racing
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saratoga Springs, N.Y. -- The 20th century careens toward the
finish line. Look in the rear-view mirror, and among the objects
getting smaller and smaller is horse racing in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bad day at the races,'' spoke one wise man, ``is better than
a good day anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, those words were delivered in a bygone era when racing was
esteemed as the sport of kings. In today's giddyup-and-go society,
a kick-back day at the track _ one-to-two-minute spurts of furious
action, separated by nearly a half-hour of waiting _ has become a
tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   Hallelujah, then, for this hallowed ground in upstate New York.
Saratoga Race Course, whose six-week season launches July 29 and
winds down on Labor Day, may not lure the swiftest horses or the
most skilled jockeys, nor offer the cushiest amenities. But, at 134
years young, the nation's oldest continuously operating track has
deftly blended elements of its distant past with such modern
conveniences as 875 TV monitors for close-ups of the races.
Somehow, the mix makes for a day that you wish would never end.
</P>
<P>
   Important aside: Even if you don't know a furlong from a
fetlock, or think post time is when the mail arrives, do not
hesitate to tag along with your horse-derelict spouse, relative or
pal. There's plenty to engage your interest _ not only at the track
but about the town. Saratoga is home to stately Victorian
architecture, soothing spas, arts with a capital A, antique stores
and atmospheric places for food and drink.
</P>
<P>
   The quickest route from Atlanta is a flight to Albany, N.Y.,
then a half-hour drive the rest of the way. Time permitted me to
catch a train out of Penn Station in New York for a leisurely 3 1/2
hours spent alternately staring out the window at the Hudson River
or at the Daily Racing Form in my lap. Between Poughkeepsie and
Schenectady, I caught a nap. By the time I'd reached the
whistle-stop station in the Springs, I was as refreshed and anxious
as a frisky colt in the starting gate.
</P>
<P>
   A short taxi ride later, and I was deposited at either a
racetrack or the set of a Victorian-era movie under production.
Saratoga has aged gracefully, its wooden clubhouse floors, spired
roof and quaint seating for 15,000 all suggesting a bygone era.
Ignore the concession stand prices _ $7.75 for a tall, thin glass
of Moet &AMP; Chandon champagne, strawberry included _ and focus
instead on the architecture, the apparel, the country-fair flavor.
It's the type of place where the Leonardo DiCaprio character in
``Titanic'' would have spent a summer mucking stalls by morning and
talking his way onto millionaire's row for the afternoon's racing.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, listen closely, and you can hear that clock ticking off the
last seconds of the 20th century slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   An hour before the first race, bettors and employees halt their
business and pause as an instrumental version of the National
Anthem plays. Some place their hands over their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Many women wear fancy dresses and shade-producing hats, while
men slip on sport coats _ all in keeping with the track's tradition
of elegant attire.
</P>
<P>
   Kid-friendly Saratoga welcomes families. Strollers and coolers
compete for space under oak, elm, maple and pine trees near the
gazebo and wishing well in the picnic areas behind the grandstand,
where some patrons never see a race and don't seem to care. A band
plays, artists and crafters display their equine-related wares and
hawkers peddle an array of snacks and refreshments _ Ben &AMP; Jerry's,
Carolina Barbecue, Italian ices and the local microbrew, North
Country.
</P>
<P>
   Jockeys emerge from a white clapboard house that serves as their
quarters and stroll through the crowd toward the paddock, where
their mounts await. Shadowed by security guards who seem
superfluous, the tiny riders slow to fetch paper and pen from
youngsters nearly as tall as they are and cheerfully sign
autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Before one race, I walked behind the jockeys' building and
noticed the peerless Jerry Bailey talking strategy across a fence
with a suited man. I parked myself close enough to eavesdrop.
</P>
<P>
   I derived no special insight from the conversation, so I placed
my bet with the usual lack of confidence and made my way back to
the clubhouse to watch the jockeys in their colorful silks guide
the gorgeous animals around the dirt oval track. As the horses were
steered down the stretch, the T-shirted crowd at ground level and
the dapper upper crust in their private boxes rose as one, programs
or parimutuel tickets clutched in hand, to loudly urge on their
betting choice.
</P>
<P>
   Some races unfold on Saratoga's exquisitely manicured turf, or
grass, course. And, in a bow to the sport's European roots, hurdles
are placed on the track for one steeplechase race daily.
</P>
<P>
   Racing hard-cores will appreciate the guarantee of one
``stakes'' race, involving top-caliber thoroughbreds, on each card.
</P>
<P>
   Later, I stumbled across the Carousel bar, surrounded by
merry-go-round horses. Sipping a beer, I decided the difficult
choice here is not which horse to wager on but where to pass the
time at the track.
</P>
<P>
   I hated to see the last race end, but there was a town out there
to explore, if a small one. Two high schools are sufficient to
accommodate the 25,000 residents, fewer than the track's turnstile
count on many days.
</P>
<P>
   First stop: the Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame, lesser-known
of the two sports museums in these parts. (Baseball's Cooperstown
is barely two hours down the road.) The hall, just outside the
track's gates, mixes artifacts, such as old saddles and
turn-of-the-century paintings, with interactive features, including
audio bios of jockeys and race calls. Then it's a short stroll to
Siro's, the bar/restaurant, to cry in your beer (losers) or buy a
round for your group (winners).
</P>
<P>
   City center isn't far, with its shops and eateries. Stay the
course north on Broadway, the main drag, and don't be deceived by
the Salvation Army Center: Another block, and you're about to
invade the territory of the rich and famous. Horse owners and the
mile-high society _ Whitneys, Vanderbilts _ summer on this stretch
in fabulously refurbished three-story homes.
</P>
<P>
   The upper crust, and those social climbers who share their
tastes, do not want for post-race activities. The Saratoga
Performing Arts Center hosts the New York City Ballet and
Philadelphia Orchestra. There is an array of music festivals and
art galleries. Men with names ending in Roman numerals can break a
sweat with polo matches. The Victorian architecture is so
distinguished here that one storefront displayed a series of photos
titled ``Porches of Saratoga.''
</P>
<P>
   History buffs can immerse themselves in forts, monuments, an old
monastery and the casinos that operated during the first half of
the century, setting the gambling climate. If a Saratogian's office
building or home has not made the National Register of Historic
Places, he should feel left out.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond horses, the town is best-known, as its name implies, for
the naturally carbonated water flowing from mineral springs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Crystal Spa, I skimmed a menu with a la carte choices
from a simple bath or pedicure to a European facial or herbal wrap.
The packages range from the Rejuvenator ($47) to the ``The
Experience of a Lifetime,'' which runs $110, takes 2 1/2 hours and
features something called a Seasalt Loofah. Whatever, it's
perfectly legal.
</P>
<P>
   Preferring to save all available dollars for the betting
windows, I chose the basic bath. I shed my clothes and slid into a
tub of water that made my body tingle and relax, if only slightly.
You may get more stimulation from Magic Fingers in your hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the myriad non-equine attractions, a tour of the town
eliminated any doubt that this is horse country. Lawn jockeys
patrol front yards. Sculptures of horses stand sentry in front of
the convention center.
</P>
<P>
   You can bed down at the Turf &AMP; Spa or Thorobred Motel. Dine at
Bookmakers, the Stable Stop Deli or the Trackside Grill. Drink at
Trotters, Drafthorse, the Horseshoe Inn Bar &AMP; Grill or Gaffney's
Starting Gate.
</P>
<P>
   On race days, the local newspaper includes a four-page pullout
called the Pink Sheet devoted exclusively to racing. (Headline
writers refer to the track simply as the Spa.) Many buyers grab the
morning edition, lift out the Pink Sheet and discard the rest. One
day last summer, however, they would have missed the two most
prominent stories on page 1A _ a profile of a jockey and reports of
a racing bill in the state Legislature _ and the lead editorial,
with this headline: ``Paddock teaches kids nuts and bolts about
horse racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, one municipal nod to modernization is the
installation of ATMs. You may need them, unless you hit a long shot
at the track. The area's 1,100 rooms fill quickly, as do the homes
that rent out for one to six weeks, and nothing is inexpensive. My
spacious but ratty hotel room ran $150 per night, three times its
normal rate. But when ``no vacancy'' signs are flashing, who can
argue?
</P>
<P>
   The summer night, devoid of humidity or bugs, was the type you
wished would go on forever, like in ``American Graffiti.'' But
bar-hopping till just past 10 was enough for me. There was
tomorrow's Daily Racing Form to study and some sleep to log before
I would rise at dawn. I would soon experience one more reason to do
the 'Toga: 7 a.m. breakfast at trackside, watching horses exercise
through the morning mist.
</P>

 &HT;    Summer series based on novel shows little of book storyline
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pasadena, Calif. _ ABC may be quietly burying one of the most
promising new series of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maximum Bob,'' based very loosely on the Elmore Leonard novel,
will get a seven-week run starting Aug. 4, when it wil air in
``NYPD Blue's'' timeslot at 10 p.m. Tuesdays. Traditionally, summer
seres are considered less prestigious than the big fall debuts,
although very occasionally, one pops through to success. Eight
years ago, CBS debuted ``Northern Exposure'' in the summer, and the
quirky little drama about Cicely, Alaska, went on to be a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maximum Bob'' has some of the same off-center feel of
``Exposure.'' It's set in the fictional Florida town of Deep Water,
a place where the judge, ``Maximum'' Bob Gibbs (Beau Bridges) is a
flamboyantly corrput despot, his wife is a former Weeki Wachee
``mermaid'' turned psychic, the sherriff is obsessed with
competitive ballroom dancing, and two dim-bulb twins named Dirk and
Bogarde show up for little good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's billed as Elmore Leonard-land, fans of
Florida-noir novels will feel more like they're submerged in the
surreal dark comedy of Carl Hiaasen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a conscious effort to sort of lighten up the
darkness a little bit,'' executive producer Alex Gansa told TV
critics meeting here to preview the new fall season. (The show was
developed by film director Barry Sonnenfeld, who did the ``Addams
Family'' and ``Men in Black'' movies.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at first when you hear that you're not on the (fall)
schedule, which is everybody's ambition, you have a little bit of a
moment for pause,'' says Barry Josephson, the other exec producer.
``But summer's a great time to break a new show and something that
is a litte different, like this show is.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is ABC running ``Maximum Bob'' in the summer, it cut
down on the number of episodes it ordered, from the original 13 to
a mere seven. ABC execs say if the show succeeds, it will come back
in mid-season.
</P>
<P>
   Bridges is hilarious as Maximum Bob, an unrepentant, politically
incorrect pig.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one of the episodes, we deal with sexual harassment, where
suddenly all these women are coming out of the woodwork saying I
did that to them, I did this to them, I bit this woman in the
tush,'' Bridges says. ``I have to go to court to save my good name.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in the end, when I've been exonerated, I get together with
my wife and she calls me a hound dog. And I say to her, 'Listen,
Leanne, you're right, I have been a hound dog ... But honey muffin,
I swear to you that I am trying to work my way up the evolutionary
ladder.' ''
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   ABC on CNN
</P>
<P>
   ABC News president David Westin offered both praise and implicit
criticism of CNN's handling of its Operation Tailwind story and
subsequent retraction and apology. Asked by TV critics about the
issue Thursday, Westin said, ``I know (CNN chairman) Tom Johnson
well. Nothing in his conduct has diminished my respect for him. I
think he's handled it in an exemplary fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   But he went on to say that ABC News reporters would never be in
the embarrassing position of CNN correspondent Peter Arnett, who
was the on-camera reporter for the Tailwind story but later said he
had done very little of the reporting. (Arnett was reprimanded by
CNN.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our correspondents take responsibility for what they say on
the air,'' Westin said. ``At ABC, we would never, never do a
serious investigative piece and have a correspondent come in at the
last minute and do a voice-over. Our correspondents would never
stand for that and I would never tolerate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford promotes new series
</P>
<P>
   Model Cindy Crawford got in her own little dig at CNN Thursday
as well, when she appeared before TV critics to promote her
upcoming (and provocatively titled) special ``Sex With Cindy
Crawford.'' The special, which airs Sept. 22 on ABC, is meant to be
informative, with Crawford acting like a journalist, even though
she freely admits she isn't one. One line of questioning was
whether the special would be credible, since it was produced by
ABC's entertainent division rather than its news division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or (produced by) CNN for example?'' Crawford asked, and then
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Titanic to go air live
</P>
<P>
   Celine Dion can't stop singing ``My Heart Will Go On'' and TV
can't shy away from the Titanic. On Aug. 16, Discovery will air
live film footage of the sunken ship during a summer underwater
expedition. ``Baby'' remote cameras will travel further inside
Titanic than ever before. The live broadcast will be seen in more
than 100 countries with simultaneous translation in Spanish,
Mandarin, Thai and Japanese.

 &HT;    Reversing himself, Yeltsin chooses to attend czar's burial
 &HT;    By Charles W. Holmes
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ President Boris Yeltsin reversed his
earlier decision and pledged to attend Friday's burial of Russia's
last czar, a final erratic twist in the nation's jumbled plans to
entomb Nicholas II and his family on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise announcement from the Kremlin, Yeltsin said
Thursday he would attend the service in the former imperial capital
of St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth (about the executions) was concealed for 80 years,''
Yeltsin said. ``Tomorrow, the truth should be told, and I should
take part.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia will bury the fragmented skeletal remains of Nicholas,
his wife Alexandra, three of their five children and four family
servants. The family and their attendants were killed by a
Bolshevik firing squad in 1918, ending the 300-year reign of the
Romanovs of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's decision last month not to attend the ceremony
followed the refusal of the Russian Orthodox Church to acknowledge
the identification of the bones as that of the czar and his family,
despite exhaustive genetic testing and confirmation by an
international team of scientists.
</P>
<P>
   His decision started an avalanche of official backsliding over
what had been intended as a full-scale royal funeral designed to
celebrate Russian history and heal old wounds following the Russian
revolution and seven brutal decades of Soviet rule.
</P>
<P>
   After the church hierarchy and Yeltsin declined, a host of world
leaders, prominent royalty and Russia's top politicians decided not
to attend. The Russian government scaled back the ceremony,
spending less than $1 million on the three-day observance, which
began Wednesday in Yekaterinburg, the city where Nicholas and his
family were killed.
</P>
<P>
   As Russia's pioneering reformer in 1991, Yeltsin prompted the
unearthing of the Romanov's remains from a shallow grave in
Yekaterinburg. Yeltsin's reversal Thursday came without elaboration
about his change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   A Kremlin statement said: ``Putting to rest the remains of
innocent people who were murdered, the present generation of
Russians is striving to atone for the sins of their predecessors.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, eight decades after he abdicated and was later
exiled to Siberia before his death, Nicholas and his family
returned to St. Petersburg. Their remains were carried in nine
small coffins, flown in an Aeroflot jumbo jet to the city's Pulkovo
airport and furnished a military honor guard.
</P>
<P>
   As bagpipes moaned and drums rolled, dozens of descendants of
the Romanov family, clad in black, followed the procession into the
St. Peter and St. Paul Cathedral, burial place of czars since Peter
the Great.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people quietly lined the streets to catch a glimpse
of the motorcade as it passed through the streets of St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see the bones of the last emperor, to see history
being made, to be a part of it'' said Tatyana Salmina, 52, a worker
at a nuclear power plant who stood on a crowded sidewalk near the
czar's former residence, the Winter Palace.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional trim begins.)
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a local priest will preside over a simple ceremony
which acknowledges the family not by name, but merely as victims of
the Communist era. Wreaths will be laid, a choir will sing, cannons
will thunder and a short service will pray for the souls of the
entire family, including the two children whose bodies are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Patriarch Alexy II, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, has
sought to distance himself from the rites and will preside over a
rival service for the dead of the Soviet years at a monastery near
Moscow.

   SHARP-DRIVING _ ATLANTA -- It was like a brief trip into
automotive heaven. As a driving enthusiast, the mere mention of the
German autobahns has been like a vision of sugarplums dancing in my
head. It truly was Christmas in July during a trip to Germany. For
me, it was the ultimate treat. Traveling at speeds in excess of 110
mph, our little 170-horsepower Saab sprinted happily along, once
even legally passing a police car. What a rush! The system seems so
sensible, and it's difficult to argue its logic. Not once in more
than 600 miles of driving did I see a single accident or a tinge of
animosity between drivers. If only we could make it work on our far
superior interstate highway system. (Sharp, Atlanta

<P>
   MECHANIC _ ATLANTA -- Gasoline is a hot topic these days. Three
readers have fuel-related questions, two about fuel quality and one
about gas stations. Let's tackle the confusion about fuel first.
David Harris writes: ``I take excellent care of our three cars
(change the oil every 2,500 miles, etc.), but I buy the cheapest
gasoline I can find. How do I determine which fuel is a
good-quality fuel?'' (Carter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

WITH SANCTIONS LIFTED, PAKISTAN MAKES MAJOR U.S. WHEAT PURCHASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pakistan Thursday agreed to buy about $30 million
worth of wheat from the United States, increasing its planned
purchase to reward Congress and U.S. farmers for acting quickly to
remove sanctions imposed against the country for testing nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the U.S. wheat Pakistan bought is expected to come from
Washington state, which is the source of half the soft white wheat
exported by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had been barred from selling wheat to Pakistan
_ the largest importer of U.S. white wheat _ under the terms of
sanctions imposed after Pakistan and India tested nuclear weapons
in May.
</P>
<P>
   Congress this week passed a bill to exempt agricultural sales
from the sanctions, and President Clinton signed the measure into
law just 17 hours before Pakistan accepted bids for this week's
major purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan had planned to purchase 300,000 metric tons of soft
white wheat this week, and Australia offered to fill that order at
a lower price than did the United States. But Pakistan decided to
increase its purchase, to 500,000 metric tons, in order to steer a
sizable order to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan will now purchase 300,000 metric tons from the United
States and 200,000 metric tons from Australia. The value of the
U.S. purchase was estimated at $32 million by the Pakistani Embassy
and at $29 million by U.S. Wheat Associates, an export market
development organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting good rates, and we thought that when the U.S.
farmers and their representatives had put in so much effort, we
should buy more wheat from the United States,'' said Farrakh
Qayyum, the trade minister at the Pakistani Embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Australians had offered us a very competitive price, but
we wanted the Americans to participate so we held the tender back a
few days to allow Congress to go ahead, and we decided to provide
some satisfaction ... that their efforts hadn't gone to waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheat farmers, who are facing historic low prices because of the
Asian economic crisis and strong harvests worldwide, were delighted
to have a rare positive development.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is wonderful news,'' said Christopher Shaffer, a
fifth-generation wheat farmer in Walla Walla and the chairman of
the Washington Wheat Commission. ``There was a lot of concern they
(Pakistan) would hold a grudge against us for the original embargo,
but it looks like we've been able to work through that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan last year accounted for 40 percent of overall U.S.
white wheat exports and 37 percent of Northwest exports, according
to U.S. Wheat Associates. Pakistan purchased 2.2 million tons of
wheat from the U.S. last year.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. wheat will actually be purchased from a variety of
exporters, who buy wheat from farmers and sell it to foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much needed dose of export demand at a time when we are
facing a shortage of storage space and a shortage of market,'' said
Jonathan Schlueter, executive vice president of the Pacific
Northwest Grain and Feed Association, which represents commercial
grain handlers. ``There will be fewer ground piles (of wheat) in
the Pacific Northwest as a result. This will move grain through the
system, and we need to get it moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlueter said the industry had expected that Australia would
win a sizable portion of the Pakistani purchase because Australia
had refused to impose agricultural sanctions against Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest lawmakers, including Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash.,
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., pushed
hard to have the sanctions removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistan has been a good trading partner and is seeking a good
relationship with the U.S.'' said Nethercutt, who was one of
several lawmakers called by Pakistan's ambassador to the United
States about the sale yesterday. ``The purchase is an indication
that they're grateful, rather than resentful, and now we have sold
300,000 tons we wouldn't have otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton was also pleased with the purchase, but said the plight
of wheat farmers demands greater action by the Clinton
administration. He sent a letter to Clinton urging him to
re-evaluate a broad array of sanctions, to implement more
agricultural export programs, to support agricultural research
projects, and to push harder to get U.S. wheat into China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commodity prices are hitting record lows and the fear of
bankruptcy looms for many in the agriculture community,'' Gorton
wrote. ``What we do today ... to help our farmers will determine
their economic viability for years to come.''

<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running times and
ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ARMAGEDDON,' starring Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler.
Directed by Michael Bay (PG-13, 144 minutes). This big, showy,
spirit-crushing summer extravaganza includes not a single heartfelt
moment, unless you count its sequence set in a strip club. Imminent
doom (courtesy of an approaching asteroid) becomes the excuse for
rampant flag-waving, gung-ho patriotism and a notion of heroism
that has nothing whatever to do with real courage. Willis gets the
film's noblest lines for the same reason that he probably got the
set's biggest trailer. Affleck tries gamely to seem mad about Ms.
Tyler, who serves as window-dressing at NASA headquarters. Totally
predictable elements _ loud noises, frequent explosions and bright
computer-screen colors _ seem as inevitable and deadly as the
asteroid while they create the illusion of escapist fun.
</P>
<P>
   `DR. DOLITTLE,' starring Eddie Murphy. Directed by Betty Thomas
(PG-13, 85 minutes). When this Dr. Dolittle talks to the animals,
they pile on the back talk, thanks to the stellar cast of vocal
talent (Ellen DeGeneres, Garry Shandling, Paul Reubens, John
Leguizamo) that keeps the wisecracks flying. And Murphy plays
straight man with hilarious aplomb. This good-humored family film
is formulaic but steadily funny (and a lot less corrosive than
``The Nutty Professor''), thanks not only to Murphy's understated
timing, but also to expertly computer-enhanced performances from
the animal cast.
</P>
<P>
   `GONE WITH THE WIND,' starring Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable.
Directed by Victor Fleming (G, 220 minutes). There's still a lot of
robust life left in this 1939 David O. Selznick adaptation of
Margaret Mitchell's romantic novel of the Old South (possibly as it
never existed) just before, during and after the Civil War. Not a
great film but a satisfying one. The performances by Leigh, Gable
and Hattie McDaniel are ravishing, and there's grandeur in the
meticulous physical production. The movie shows its age most
unfortunately in the uneven quality of the Technicolor prints,
which, though new, go sort of pinkish more often than they should.
</P>
<P>
   `HENRY FOOL,' starring Thomas Jay Ryan, James Urbaniak and
Parker Posey. Directed by Hal Hartley (R, 138 minutes). The
affectless precision of this filmmaker's previous work is
absolutely no preparation for the brilliance and deep resonance of
this contemporary parable. Without forsaking the clean, spare look
and hyperreal clarity that are his trademarks, Hartley moves into a
much larger realm with a meditation on, among other things, art,
trust, loyalty, politics and popular culture. When Henry Fool
(Ryan) bursts mysteriously into the thankless life of Simon Grim
(Urbaniak) and urges this silent garbage man to start writing, the
results are strange and sublime. Ms. Posey plays Simon's slatternly
sister with nonchalant wit in one of her best roles. A few
glaringly scatological touches don't detract from the film's
elegance of vision.
</P>
<P>
   `THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO,' starring Kate Beckinsale and Chloe
Sevigny. Directed by Whit Stillman (R, 112 minutes). Stillman's
smart, fretful, patrician characters turn up midway between
``Metropolitan'' and ``Barcelona'' in a film that charmingly mixes
post-college career worries with improbable discomania. A
delightful cast engages in nonstop flirtation and hair-splitting
debate, rendered with Stillman's usual acuity and humor. Ms.
Beckinsale, an English actress with a flawless American accent here
and diffidence that's just as perfect, holds court beguilingly at
the center of a bright and amusing crowd. The ideal film for anyone
willing to entertain the notion that the spread of environmentalism
was sparked by the revival of ``Bambi'' during the disco
generation's formative years.
</P>
<P>
   `LETHAL WEAPON 4,' starring Mel Gibson, Danny Glover and Rene
Russo. Directed by Richard Donner (R, 125 minutes). In the full
perspective-warping heat of the summer movie season, this turns out
to be one of the nicer blow-'em-ups around. The characters are
funny and likable, and they all live on Earth. The formula still
has some zip. The stars, with the welcome new addition of Chris
Rock as a young detective who has literally married into the
``Lethal Weapon'' family, play their roles with breezy finesse. And
the story, about slave smuggling and Chinese gangsters, is a
flamboyant, fight-filled adventure fueled by jokey camaraderie and
constant forward motion. Bear in mind that this is still a film
whose idea of high drama is watching a car get pushed in front of
an oncoming train.
</P>
<P>
   `MULAN,' with the voices of Ming-Na Wen, Eddie Murphy and B.D.
Wong. Directed by Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft (G, 86 minutes).
Disney takes a sledgehammer to the subject of gender stereotyping
in this film, which not only breaks the cross-dressing barrier but
also ratchets up the violence level for children's animation. This
is the most inert and formulaic of recent Disney animated films,
right down to the jokey sidekicks, would-be ``Under the Sea''
production number and Destiny ballad from the intrepid heroine
(``When will my reflection show who I am inside?''). Murphy's very
funny wisecracks make the character of a little dragon
entertaining, but this black-sounding character is also treated as
a servile clown. The animation mimics live-action crowd scenes more
often than it takes audiences to the realm of the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   `NIGHTS OF CABIRIA,' starring Giulietta Masina. Directed by
Federico Fellini (not rated; 117 minutes). Anyone dismayed by the
hyperkinetic emptiness of summertime film spectacles will find the
antidote in this 1957 Fellini masterpiece. It has been refurbished
and revived by the same team that brought back ``Contempt'' last
year, and they display the same acumen in reissuing a film of
special prescience; though it was shot in black and white amid the
poverty of postwar Italy, neither the style nor the searching of
``Cabiria' has grown dated at all. In a prize-winning and
heartbreaking performance, the star plays a scrappy Roman
streetwalker who drifts almost magically among the film's
astonishingly varied realms. There is more grace and courage in the
famous image of Masina smiling through her tears than in all the
fire-breathing blockbusters Hollywood has to offer.

BANKBOSTON NET RISES 14 PERCENT IN SECOND QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by(New York Times News Service cnients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 Thm Boston Globe   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ BankBoston Corp. reported a 14 percent increase in
second-quarter earnings Thursday, as gains in fees earned from
fijancial servicer far outweighed losses from trading in volatile
emerging-markets securitieS.
</P>
<P>
   New England's second-largest bank said net income rose to $241.9
million, or $0.80 per diluted share, from $212 million, or $0.68 a
share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat Wall Street
expectations by $0.01 and were in line with a trend of rising
earnings from fee-related services across the banking industry.
</P>
<P>
   Total revenues grew 11 percent to $1.1 billion, mainly on growth
an non-interest income services, which include fees earned from
deposit and automated teller machine activities, overseas
securities trading, private equity placements, and mutual fund
sales and other investment activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a nice diversity across the revenues,'' said
BankBoston's chief financial officer, Susannah M. Swihart.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's 16th-largest commercial bank, which has major
operations across Latin America, a capital markets unit and a
national consumer lending business, saw fees earned from financial
services rise 23 percent to $192 million from $156 million a year
ago. Overseas activities were generally profitable, although some
areas produced losses. Emerging market debt prices, including those
for Latin America, took a hit last quarter, mainly on financial
trouble in Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a $4 million loss in emerging markets securities
trading, compared to profits of $28 million in the year-ago quarter
and $34 million in the first three months of 1998. The bank said it
had pared total loan exposure to Indonesia to $75 million from $200
million at the start of the year but lost $10 million on such
activities last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, emerging market turmoil lifted BankBoston's profits from
foreign exchange operations, which rose to $32 million from $20
million a year earlier. The company saw a general decline in
international commercial lending activities but reported an
increase in loans to Argentinian customers. Latin American
operations traditionally account for around 20 percent of the
company's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Net credit losses were $51 million, compared to $79 million a
year ago and $141 million in the first quarter of 1998.
Second-quarter non-interest expenses rose 13 percent year-on-year
to $647 million but declined on the previous quarter. All numbers
reflected BankBoston's recent 2-for-1 stock split.
</P>
<P>
   The results generally pleased banking analysts, who are sanguine
about the bank's expansion and restructuring plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fairly straight-forward quarter,'' said Ronald I.
Mandle of Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. BankBoston shares eased 13/16
Thursday to close at $56.58 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston, with $70.5 billion in assets, is second in size in
New England to Fleet Financial Group, Inc., but it is expanding
rapidly in Argentina and Brazil and also has strong toeholds in
Chile, Columbia, Peru, and other regional countries. It bought
San-Francisco-based investment bank Robertson, Stephens Inc. in
May, acquiring the equity-underwriting, research, and advisory
services that many banks now seek. The $800 million deal is to
close in September.

   `THE OPPOSITE OF SEX,' starring Christina Ricci, Martin Donovan,
Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Directed by Don Roos (R, 100 minutes).
Wicked, foulmouthed and very funny, this gleefully acerbic comedy
finds that Ms. Ricci has morphed enchantingly from nasty little
Wednesday of ``The Addams Family'' into Lolita's evil twin.
Voluptuous and scheming, her poisonous Dedee narrates this film and
announces immediately that she won't be developing a heart of gold.
Which is, of course, mostly a lie. The film brutally skewers
preconceptions about gay and straight life, then lets its
characters intermingle in sweetly unexpected ways. Donovan and Ms.
Kudrow, as unlikely comrades brought together by Dedee's treachery,
deliver the zingers from Roos' screenplay with deadpan panache.
</P>
<P>
   `OUT OF SIGHT,' starring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez.
Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 120 minutes). As directed with
terrific panache by Soderbergh in his most frankly commercial
effort, Clooney and Ms. Lopez take an intricate Elmore Leonard
crime tale and give it steam heat. Like ``Get Shorty,'' this story
has been adapted from a Leonard novel by Scott Frank, who knows
exactly how to capture the writer's shrewd, hard-boiled style on
screen. An outstanding supporting cast _ including Don Cheadle,
Dennis Farina and Albert Brooks _ provides the movie with a vivid
rogues' gallery and remains good fun even when the story is
occasionally confusing. To fill in the blanks, go back to Leonard's
version; there are certainly worse ways to spend a summer
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   `A PERFECT MURDER,' starring Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow
and Viggo Mortensen. Directed by Andrew Davis (R, 107 minutes). The
characters may be cardboard-thin in this film, a skillfully plotted
update of Frederick Knott's play (and Alfred Hitchcock's film)
``Dial M for Murder,'' but the nasty cat-and-mouse games they play
are icily amusing. Douglas, looking more than ever like a wattled,
riled-up rooster, is Steven Taylor, a shady Wall Street bond trader
in deep financial trouble who hires his rich wife's handsome lover
(Mortensen), a con man posing as a painter, to murder her. It's not
as easy as he hopes. Ms. Paltrow, looking chic, is the wife, Emily,
a translator at the United Nations, who has her own agenda. The
story takes enough surprising twists to keep you engrossed, and the
high-style ambiance (especially the Taylors' Fifth Avenue
apartment) is mouthwatering.
</P>
<P>
   `SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS,' starring Anne Heche and Harrison Ford.
Directed by Ivan Reitman (PG-13, 146 minutes). This escapist
romance for the Treadmill Generation is a workout in its own right,
putting its stars through the wringer (and into a ``From Here to
Eternity'' surf clinch complete with hiking boots). The leads are
attractive and funny, and the screenplay strives for a
Tracy-Hepburn dynamic, but this truly strenuous love story is as
long on tropical scenery as it is short on new ideas. Once the
stars are marooned in splendid isolation, the film has to cook up
pirates and a snake in Ms. Heche's shorts just to keep afloat. In
supporting roles, David Schwimmer makes a drippy beau for Ms.
Heche; Temuera Morrison deserves his own pirate picture, and the
ex-grocery clerk Jacqueline Obrados torches up the film as if Salma
Hayek were in town.
</P>
<P>
   `SMALL SOLDIERS,' starring Gregory Smith and Phil Hartman.
Directed by Joe Dante (PG-13, 105 minutes). This ably animated film
about action-figure toys who virtually come to life should have
been a sure thing. There are innocent echoes of ``Toy Story'' and
darker ones of the director's own ``Gremlins'' pictures, which had
the witty balance of mischief and horror that ``Small Soldiers''
strangely lacks. The voice talent here is extraordinary, with the
casts of ``The Dirty Dozen'' and ``This Is Spinal Tap'' playing
rival toy factions, and Tommy Lee Jones and Frank Langella as their
respective commanders. But the story remains unfocused and grows
too wan for horror, too creepy for lighthearted fun. Another reason
not to laugh is Hartman's performance in the fatuous role that was
his last.
</P>
<P>
   `THE TRUMAN SHOW,' starring Jim Carrey. Directed by Peter Weir
(PG, 104 minutes). The ultimate in high-concept ingenuity. Hosannas
and cartwheels for this ingenious media-age fantasy are over the
top, but by comparison with Hollywood's usual notion of summer
movie fare, it's definitely a dazzler. Carrey, refreshingly free of
shtick, gives an instantly iconic performance as a guinea pig for
an entertainment-happy nation, a man whose whole life is a fraud
contrived by Ed Harris' so-called ``televisionary.'' Carrey's
innate edge of volatility gives the material, from a screenplay of
transfixing sci-fi intensity, its trace of danger. Laura Linney, as
the actress playing a wife whose bluff could be called at any
moment, is the story's spookiest character as well as its perkiest.
Weir unifies the story's many nuances with great finesse (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE X-FILES,' starring David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson.
Directed by Rob Bowman (PG-13, 115 minutes). Conspiracy theorists,
consider this: What if the hush-hush atmosphere and Internet mania
surrounding the first ``X-Files'' feature film were part of a giant
scheme to hide the uneventfulness of a summertime sci-fi fizzle?
It's as possible as much of what this spinoff film has to offer. If
devotees of the television series approach the film with enough
baggage for a six-week safari, maybe they can deepen the experience
of watching a middling action-adventure with brand-name appeal. But
this film will strike true X-fanatics as watered down and remains
fairly bewildering to the uninitiated. And no, Scully and Mulder
don't quite take their working relationship to a higher plane.

BIRD ALL BOXED IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Larry Bird's son, Conor, saw him on the cover of a Wheaties
box recently, the boy was somewhat surprised to discover his father
had once been a pretty good basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   Conor knew his dad mainly as the coach of the Indiana Pacers,
not as the Hall of Fame player for the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Conor won't be confused anymore _ unless he returns with
dad to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   General Mills announced Thursday it was putting Bird on the
cover of a Wheaties box for the second time, with two layouts. For
the cereal sold in Indianapolis, Bird will be the stoic coach of
the Pacers. For boxes sold in Boston, he will be in a Celtics
uniform, which he last wore in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Bird previously graced the cover of a Wheaties box in 1995; that
one also was distributed in the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman said there will be 100,000 boxes on the
shelves in Indiana, Bird's home state. No figures were announced
for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   General Mills released a statement alleged to have come from
Bird saying he was honored to be chosen again. Still, Bird hasn't
caught up to Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods yet _ at least not in
the minds of those who market the so-called Breakfast of Champions.
Those two athletes, and six others, have been marketed nationally
on the cover of Wheaties boxes.

PATRIOTS SIGN SPIRES, SHAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Patriots signed third-round draft pick Greg Spires
and sixth-rounder Harold Shaw to muliti-year deals Thursday. But
more importantly the team moved closer to deals on its first-round
picks Robert Edwards and Tebucky Jones.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that deals for both Edwards, a running back from
Georgia, and Jones, a defensive back from Syracuse, will run in the
4-year, $5.5 million-6 million range and will be at least partially
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots aren't opposed to guaranteeing money in order to
reduce signing bonuses. The team did it with Terry Glenn three
years ago when they guaranteed some of his five-year deal. In fact,
Glenn will have $1.25 million of his deal guaranteed this year and
next. He'll earn $1.6 million in 1998 and $2.05 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's No. 1 pick, Chris Canty, had $325,000 per year
guaranteed in his four-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Spires, a defensive end from Florida State and the 83d pick in
the draft, received a three-year deal worth just under $1 million
with a $350,000 signing bonus. Shaw, a running back from Southern
Mississippi, the 176th overall pick, signed a three-year deal
averaging $190,000 per annum with a $50,000 signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have four draftees left to sign. Besides Edwards
and Jones, second-round pick Tony Simmons, a wide receiver and
fifth-round pick, Ron Merkerson, a linebacker have yet to sign
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to signing Spires and Shaw, the Patriots had inked tight
end Rod Rutledge, a second-rounder; fullback Chris Floyd, a third
rounder; and seventh-round pick Jason Andersen, a center from
Brigham Young.
</P>
<P>
   After all of the rookie money is paid out, the Patriots should
still be about $100,000 under the salary cap for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are also negotiating a one or two-year deal with
Adam Vinatieri's agents, Woolf Associates. Vinatieri is an
exclusive rights player and must accept the Patriots' offer, but
the team may want to tie him up long term.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have yet to respond to a proposal from Ted
Johnson's agent, Jack Mills, on a five-year deal, but the team
hopes to keep the talks alive during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots' coaches and personnel moved their base to Smithfield,
R.I., Thursday in preparation for the start of training camp, the
team's 23d, at Bryant College Sunday.

TAX CUT HEADED FOR GOVERNOR'S SIGNATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Senate Thursday approved the $700 million tax cut
37-1, sending the legislation to Acting Governor Paul Cellucci, who
has said he will quickly sign it into law.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers can expect to see some of the benefits on their
upcoming tax returns in two areas: Increased personal exemptions,
eased taxes on capital gains from the sale of a principle residence
and on individual retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The House unanimously passed the same tax package Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Only one Senate Republican, Robert Hedlund, voted against the
measure. ``I think we could have done a lot better,'' Hedlund, a
Weymouth Republican, said during debate.
</P>
<P>
   The package doubles the exemption for earned income, saving
between $131 for a single filer to $262 for joint filers; and cuts
in half the 12 percent tax rate on interest and dividend income.
</P>
<P>
   The new 5.95 percent tax rate for unearned income would be
applied to tax year 1999.
</P>
<P>
   As for the doubling of exemptions, taxpayers will be able to
receive 75 percent of the phased-in savings this year and 100
percent of the savings the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also allows the stabilization, or rainy day, fund to
grow by as much as $475 million to $1.42 billion. The proposal also
reduces unemployment insurance rates by $116 million, funneling
another $18 million toward creating a work force development
program.
</P>
<P>
   The bill does not include Cellucci's proposal to lower the
income tax from 5.95 to 5 percent, which would cost more than $1.2
billion when fully phased in over three years.

INSIDE ART: SETTLEMENT PAID IN PAINTINGS; SOTHEBY'S ON THE NET; 2
MUSEUMS FILL POSTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   When a $5 million lead pledge to the Museum of Contemporary Art
in Chicago from its chairman went unpaid, the institution took
action.
</P>
<P>
   An out-of-court settlement was reached last week, but the museum
got two paintings instead of cash.
</P>
<P>
   When the museum began raising money to finance its new $50
million building, which opened two years ago on a two-acre site on
Chicago Avenue, Paul Oliver-Hoffmann, a real estate developer, who
was chairman of the museum's board, agreed in writing to give $5
million to help endow and operate the building.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed in Cook County Circuit Court on Dec. 31,
1997, the museum said Oliver-Hoffmann's pledge was to be paid in
full by June 30, 1997. Documents filed in the case showed seven
payment forms and unanswered reminders dating from November 1991 to
June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not consider this a pledge but rather a letter of
intent, which is not a binding document,'' said Camille
Oliver-Hoffmann, the wife of Oliver-Hoffmann, who died in April.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver-Hoffman, who with his wife was a well-known contemporary
art collector, was asked to join the museum's board in 1981. Mrs.
Oliver-Hoffmann said he decided not to go through with the gift
when he began having differences of opinion with other museum board
members and with Kevin Consey, who was the director at the time,
over the museum's financial management.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband expected he would have a voice in the way the money
was to be allocated'' Mrs. Oliver-Hoffmann said. ``But, in 1990,
when he realized he wasn't going to, he resigned from the board and
never set foot in the museum again. Then, when he lay dying of a
terminal illness, we were sued.''
</P>
<P>
   To settle the case, Mrs. Oliver-Hoffmann agreed to give the
museum two works of art from her collection: ``Banner,'' a 1990
painting by Anselm Kiefer, and ``Cindy,'' a portrait of Cindy
Sherman from 1988 by Chuck Close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes to end up in litigation, especially a nonprofit
institution,'' said Penny Pritzker, the museum's chairwoman. ``This
was an unfortunate and very unusual situation and we are glad it is
settled.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice of paintings were made by the museum. ``We had no
works by Kiefer and only three works on paper by Close,'' said
Michael Thomas, a museum spokesman. ``These works fill some large
holes.'' Mrs. Oliver-Hoffman said, ``My husband was both dedicated
and devoted to the museum during his lifetime.'' She added: ``I
felt it was only fitting that he be honored this way. He would have
been happy to see these paintings hanging in the museum.''

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sotheby's began as a book auctioneer 250 years ago,
and in its first Internet auction is selling books.
</P>
<P>
   The sale consists of 122 lots of American, English and juvenile
literature; books on theater, opera and ballet; property from the
estate of Donald and Jean Stralem, New York collectors, and books
from the estate of James Heineman, a New York publisher. Also for
sale are a first edition of Nathaniel Hawthorne's ``Scarlet
Letter'' and an edition of Edgar Rice Burrough's ``Tarzan of the
Apes,'' as well as about 300 autographed Time magazine covers.
</P>
<P>
   Interested buyers may leave bids on Sotheby's Web-based bid
sheet, www.sothebys.com; bidding may also be done by e-mail to
book.auction(AT)sothebys.com, or by fax at (212) 774-5385. All bids
must be in by July 21, at 1 p.m. EDT. Sotheby's will then determine
who has made the highest bids and which bids meet the sellers
reserve, the secret minimum price agreed upon by the seller and the
auction house. Bidders will be notified whether they have been
successful within 10 days of the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The auction house decided to test the Internet waters by selling
books rather than works of art, Sotheby's officials said, because
there was already an enormous amount of book buying on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an understanding that people buy books, sight
unseen,'' said David Reden, who runs Sotheby's book department.
</P>
<P>
   The books were on exhibit at Sotheby's York Avenue headquarters
the last two weeks in June and are now on view at Sotheby's book
department at 411 E. 76th St.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby officials said they carefully considered which books to
sell and purposely selected as wide a range of titles to explore
just what Internet buyers are interested in.
</P>
<P>
   ``By offering the books on the Internet, people won't have to
pick up the phone during business hours,'' Redden said. ``It's
amazing how much activity on the Internet takes place in the middle
of the night.''

   Jewish Museum
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish Museum in Berlin is gearing up to open its doors in
2000 in a new building designed by the Polish-born architect Daniel
Libeskind, and so is beginning to put a staff in place. This week
it named Tom Freudenheim, a German-born American, to become its
deputy director and chief operating officer beginning September
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Freudenheim was head of the Museums and Humanities Program at
the National Endowment for the Arts and has been a curator at the
Jewish Museum in New York. Most recently he has been the executive
director of the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In his new job he will collaborate with W. Michael Blumenthal,
director of the Jewish Museum in Berlin, in shaping the museum's
core programs and permanent installations.

   Guggenheim
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Guggenheim curator Robert Rosenblum has been named
the first Stephen and Nan Swid Curator of 20th-century art at the
Solomon Guggenheim Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The newly endowed senior curatorial position, the first for the
Guggenheim, is to be held by a distinguished art historian and has
been given by Stephen Swid, vice president and treasurer of the
Guggenheim Foundation, and his wife, Nan Swid, founder of Nan Swid
Design.

AT ABC, THIS YEAR'S SUPERMODEL IS JUST A TEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ You waken at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, prop
yourself up in bed to read the day's schedule and see, firm for
noon, ``Sex With Cindy Crawford.''
</P>
<P>
   And because you are a television critic, the first thing you
think is, this could mean that the PBS portion of the press tour
has come to a close.
</P>
<P>
   It will also be apparent that ``Sex With Cindy Crawford'' is an
ABC special. While Crawford will be in attendance, the only
intercourse on anyone's card is over an interviewer's microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are less pleasant ways to contribute to a 401k.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Crawford was preceded on the schedule by Jamie
Tarses, ABC Entertainment president, and by ABC Entertainment
chairman Stuart Bloomberg, who graduated magna cum laude from
Georgetown University so that he could rave to critics about ``Boy
Meets World.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarses and Bloomberg have survived a year together at Disney's
disaster network, but no one is blowing boat horns.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is in the third year of a nasty ratings slump. There were
nights last season when its total viewing audience could have
erected pup tents in a phone booth. Frankly, I'm surprised that
Cindy Crawford isn't anchoring ``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg, before launching into his perfunctory
bullish-on-the-new-season pitch, at least paused to acknowledge the
ugliness of the 1997-98 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played `Home Improvement' to death and weakened Tuesday
night,'' he recounted. ``We had critically acclaimed but
viewer-challenged dramas. TGIF (ABC's ``Thank Goodness It's
Friday'' lineup) relied too heavily on gimmick-oriented concepts.
And our movies failed to reach the right audience. Some might say,
any audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The usual reward for a season like that is a cigarette and a
blindfold. But wait: Bloomberg revealed that he's found the cure
for ABC's woes.
</P>
<P>
   Better movies. Shh _ don't let NBC hear this. But with Tarses
nodding earnestly at his side, Bloomberg said a key to ABC's
inevitable resurgence will be a ``strong and vibrant'' movie
package.
</P>
<P>
   It was the former head of movies and miniseries who got the
cigarette and blindfold. The new head of movies and miniseries,
Susan Lyne, is overseeing a roster of movie events that, on paper,
is impressive.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Gulliver's Travels'' and ``The Odyssey,'' NBC benefited
from producer Robert Halmi Sr. So ABC has hired him for
``Cleopatra,'' the miniseries, replete with sex and toga parties.
</P>
<P>
   There's a Dean Koontz miniseries, ``Mr. Murder.'' And a Stephen
King miniseries written for TV, ``Storm of the Century.'' And Tom
Clancy's ``Netforce.''
</P>
<P>
   In the made-for-TV movie category, Norman Mailer and director
Barry Levinson are involved in ``American Tragedy,'' about the
legal machinations in the O.J. Simpson murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Oprah Winfrey Presents'' franchise returns with two new
movies, including a ``David &AMP; Lisa'' remake. Christopher Reeve will
star in another remake, this one of the Alfred Hitchcock film
``Rear Window.'' Wes Craven (``Scream'') will launch a series of
scare movies on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   The theatrical features in ABC's arsenal include ``The
Birdcage,'' ``Courage Under Fire,'' ``Escape From L.A.'' and ``Up
Close and Personal.'' Not great, but maybe serviceable.
</P>
<P>
   ABC could screw it up, though. After all, I fully expect this
network to screw up ``Sex With Cindy Crawford.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, this big emphasis on movies coincides with ABC's
elimination of the customary movie slot at 9 p.m. Sundays. Look
there in the fall, and you'll find ``20/20'' and ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday is now movie night on ABC. That's the night when
everyone except crack addicts and certain species of tropical fish
is glued to NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Mondays will be available, too, after ``Monday Night Football''
expires in January. And, Tarses said, ``20/20'' and ``The
Practice'' will have to be rested on some Sunday nights _ lest
viewers become too familiar with them, presumably.
</P>
<P>
   As if movies weren't enough, ABC is marching ahead with another
year of its ``TV Is Good'' advertising campaign. You know _ yellow
and black coloring, and phrases that are funny but also profoundly
sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``If TV's so bad for you,'' asks one of the new spots, ``why is
there one in every hospital room?''
</P>
<P>
   Or: ``Don't just sit there. OK, just sit there.''
</P>
<P>
   Make one move, and Stu Bloomberg will kill you.

REGARDING BASEBALL NICKNAMES: CREATIVITY HAS WANED, BUT THRILL IS
NOT GONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Fresno Flash is borrowing a page from the Bard, discussing
what's in a name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call Will, `Thrill,' '' the Flash says. ``Rusty is `Rojo.'
Lee is `Big Stuff.' I call Lee, `Sugar Bear.' He calls me
`Sweetness.' I couldn't tell you why we each do that, but we do.
You get into a little pattern, and it takes off from there.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Bard might have said, a baseball player by any other name
would be just as well known.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that almost every baseball player has a nickname.
``Thrill'' is Rangers first baseman Will Clark. ``Rojo'' is left
fielder Rusty Greer. ``Big Stuff'' is designated hitter Lee
Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the clubhouse, just about everybody has a nickname,''
Rangers manager Johnny ``Quaker'' Oates says. ``Very few people get
called by their name inside the clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's a name they brought with them, like Ivan
``Pudge'' Rodriguez or Juan ``Igor'' Gonzalez. Often it's a
diminutive of their last name, like Kevin ``Ellie'' Elster or
Darren ``Ollie'' Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make them up all the time,'' the Flash says. ``It gives
you something else to call a guy instead of using his formal name.
It kind of puts it on more of a personal level.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``the Fresno Flash'' doesn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   The person speaking is center fielder Tom Goodwin, known to
Stevens as ``Sweetness'' and the rest of his teammates as
``Goody.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time in baseball history, though, when a player with
Goodwin's speed who hailed from Fresno, Calif., might have been
known as the Fresno Flash.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the great nicknames in baseball history were bestowed by
sportswriters. The Sultan of Swat. The Iron Horse. The Yankee
Clipper. The Splendid Splinter. The Georgia Peach. The Rajah. The
Flying Dutchman. The Say Hey Kid.
</P>
<P>
   Times changed, though. As journalists began to turn a more
critical eye toward America's sports heroes and public figures, the
bestowing of nicknames by and large ended.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason that, although players rarely call each other
by their first names, the age of colorHgO|V%Xf{,{psynB$FE)!$V+) &Cx1f;

factory, is making history that could affect Mexico's entire
maquiladora industry. Han Young factory workers are the first to
vote to join an independent labor union _ defying the traditional
government-controlled labor movement. With some American labor

impose sanctions on Han Young for alleged attempts to destroy the
independent union. (Ferriss, Cox News Service)

NAFTA was passed, Mexico and the United States agreed banks would

Half an hour later, the massive sea turtle begins to deposit more

OFF THE RACK: BEYOND THE FUSS OVER BANK MERGERS AND THE NEW IRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 19)  
 (bl)  
 By FRED BROCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least two personal-finance magazines for August are providing
a reality check on a couple of the summer's news stories: bank
mergers and legislation to change the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The much-ballyhooed bank combinations are supposed to produce
``synergy'' and lower costs, which sounds great. The average
consumer might be forgiven for thinking that all this could mean
lower fees and charges for checking accounts and other bank
services.
</P>
<P>
   Well, think again. Smart Money and the August-September issue of
Your Money discuss what many people are learning the hard way:
Megabanks are using their market heft to impose megafees. The
magazines note that studies by the Federal Reserve Board and Bank
Rate Monitor, a company that tracks the industry, show that big
multistate banks charge more for their services _ often a lot more
_ than smaller banks do. And many of these banking giants are also
streamlining, a fancy term that often means closing or
consolidating neighborhood branches.
</P>
<P>
   Your Money, published by Consumers Digest, cites the case of a
retired widow in Florida who had been paying $12 a month for a
Great Western checking account that came with a $500 overdraft line
of credit: When Great Western and Washington Mutual agreed to merge
earlier this year, her free $500 line of credit dropped to $100.
This meant that she would face a $28.50 fee for every overdraft of
more than $71.50, because the fee would count toward the $100.
</P>
<P>
   According to Smart Money, a Citibank account in San Francisco
tops Bank Rate Monitor's most-expensive list. With a balance of
$1,500 in a no-interest account, and assuming 12 transactions a
month and one bounced check a year, a customer would pay $315
annually. That same $1,500 in an account at the Mutual Savings
Association in Kansas City, Mo. _ the survey's least-expensive
account _ would EARN $30.75 a year in interest. Bank Rate Monitor
operates a World Wide Web site (www.bankrate.com) that reviews
accounts in 30 large cities.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Your Money says that all this is great for
people who own stock in the big banks _ at least as long as the
economy keeps booming.
</P>
<P>
   As for legislation to make the IRS more user-friendly and to
halt abuses, Albert R. Hunt and Alan Murray of Smart Money contend
that changes for the average taxpayer will be less than indicated
by the talk coming from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt and Murray point out in their Capitol Gains column that
most of the benefits _ except for a reduction in the time an asset
must be held to qualify for the lowest capital-gains tax rate _
will go to those taxpayers who are audited by the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   These benefits include shifting the burden of proof from the
taxpayer to the IRS when tax cases go to court and making it harder
for the agency to seize property. But only a tiny fraction of
Americans face audits each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed,'' the columnists write, ``most of the benefits of the
new law will most likely fall to small-business owners and
independent contractors _ which is the main reason Republicans,
heavily dependent on small business for support, started pushing
for IRS reform in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, wage slaves won't notice much difference.
Anyway, the article says, IRS studies show that they're not the
source of much tax cheating because all of their income is reported
automatically.
</P>
<P>
   The article continues: ``Far more significant, according to
internal IRS estimates, is the failure of independent business
people to report all their income. Roughly two-fifths, or $40
billion, of the estimated `tax gap' comes from underreported
business income, and some 40 percent of that is attributed to
small-business owners. Most of the IRS enforcement efforts are
aimed at them, and most of the relief in the new law will fall
their way as well.''
</P>
<P>
   WELL, WHICH IS IT? _ Your Money says credit card costs continue
to travel north, citing interest rates that run 17 percent and
higher. But Money magazine advises readers to ``watch for falling
card rates.'' Money lists two credit card issuers, Capital One and
First USA, that are offering no-fee cards with fixed rates of
slightly less than 10 percent. The lesson in this mixed message, of
course, is to shop around.
</P>
<P>
   STAKE A CLAIM _ Kiplinger's reports that, all told, the 50
states are holding $300 billion in unclaimed money waiting to be
reunited with its owners.
</P>
<P>
   This stash has many causes: Some people change addresses and
fail to notify previous employers, banks, insurance companies and
brokerage firms, often causing their money to land in state
coffers. Others abandon property, lose records, fail to keep
paperwork or are simply unaware of some benefit that is due to
them.
</P>
<P>
   The various state treasuries maintain lists of people they can't
find. There is also a World Wide Web site (www.unclaimed.org) where
25 states post names of people who have money coming, though
Kiplinger's says the data bases are not equally comprehensive. The
magazine discovered that Steve Forbes, the publisher of Forbes
magazine and a former, and perhaps future, Presidential candidate,
has three bank accounts languishing on New York State's list of
unclaimed property.
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger's notes that the IRS has some unclaimed money, too:
Last year alone, nearly 100,000 tax refund checks were returned as
undeliverable.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKING UP _ Money asked 10 Wall Street money managers for
their favorite stocks to buy now. The picks were Aetna, Altron,
American Express, BankAmerica, Cox Communications, Dell Computer,
Health Management Associates, Laidlaw Environmental Services, Men's
Warehouse and Ocean Energy.
</P>
<P>
   BITS AND PIECES _ Smart Money has a concise rundown of changes
in the bankruptcy laws that Congress is considering . . . In
Kiplinger's, the market guru Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman, Sachs
remains bullish on stocks despite further weakening in Asian
economies . . . Money looks at home security systems; an expert
says one of the best deterrents to burglaries remains a big dog.

<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running times and
ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ARMAGEDDON,' starring Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler.
Directed by Michael Bay (PG-13, 144 minutes). This big, showy,
spirit-crushing summer extravaganza includes not a single heartfelt
moment, unless you count its sequence set in a strip club. Imminent
doom (courtesy of an approaching asteroid) becomes the excuse for
rampant flag-waving, gung-ho patriotism and a notion of heroism
that has nothing whatever to do with real courage. Willis gets the
film's noblest lines for the same reason that he probably got the
set's biggest trailer. Affleck tries gamely to seem mad about Ms.
Tyler, who serves as window-dressing at NASA headquarters. Totally
predictable elements _ loud noises, frequent explosions and bright
computer-screen colors _ seem as inevitable and deadly as the
asteroid while they create the illusion of escapist fun (Janet
Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `DR. DOLITTLE,' starring Eddie Murphy. Directed by Betty Thomas
(PG-13, 85 minutes). When this Dr. Dolittle talks to the animals,
they pile on the back talk, thanks to the stellar cast of vocal
talent (Ellen DeGeneres, Garry Shandling, Paul Reubens, John
Leguizamo) that keeps the wisecracks flying. And Murphy plays
straight man with hilarious aplomb. This good-humored family film
is formulaic but steadily funny (and a lot less corrosive than
``The Nutty Professor''), thanks not only to Murphy's understated
timing, but also to expertly computer-enhanced performances from
the animal cast (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `GONE WITH THE WIND,' starring Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable.
Directed by Victor Fleming (G, 220 minutes). There's still a lot of
robust life left in this 1939 David O. Selznick adaptation of
Margaret Mitchell's romantic novel of the Old South (possibly as it
never existed) just before, during and after the Civil War. Not a
great film but a satisfying one. The performances by Leigh, Gable
and Hattie McDaniel are ravishing, and there's grandeur in the
meticulous physical production. The movie shows its age most
unfortunately in the uneven quality of the Technicolor prints,
which, though new, go sort of pinkish more often than they should
(Vincent Canby).
</P>
<P>
   `HENRY FOOL,' starring Thomas Jay Ryan, James Urbaniak and
Parker Posey. Directed by Hal Hartley (R, 138 minutes). The
affectless precision of this filmmaker's previous work is
absolutely no preparation for the brilliance and deep resonance of
this contemporary parable. Without forsaking the clean, spare look
and hyperreal clarity that are his trademarks, Hartley moves into a
much larger realm with a meditation on, among other things, art,
trust, loyalty, politics and popular culture. When Henry Fool
(Ryan) bursts mysteriously into the thankless life of Simon Grim
(Urbaniak) and urges this silent garbage man to start writing, the
results are strange and sublime. Ms. Posey plays Simon's slatternly
sister with nonchalant wit in one of her best roles. A few
glaringly scatological touches don't detract from the film's
elegance of vision (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO,' starring Kate Beckinsale and Chloe
Sevigny. Directed by Whit Stillman (R, 112 minutes). Stillman's
smart, fretful, patrician characters turn up midway between
``Metropolitan'' and ``Barcelona'' in a film that charmingly mixes
post-college career worries with improbable discomania. A
delightful cast engages in nonstop flirtation and hair-splitting
debate, rendered with Stillman's usual acuity and humor. Ms.
Beckinsale, an English actress with a flawless American accent here
and diffidence that's just as perfect, holds court beguilingly at
the center of a bright and amusing crowd. The ideal film for anyone
willing to entertain the notion that the spread of environmentalism
was sparked by the revival of ``Bambi'' during the disco
generation's formative years (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LETHAL WEAPON 4,' starring Mel Gibson, Danny Glover and Rene
Russo. Directed by Richard Donner (R, 125 minutes). In the full
perspective-warping heat of the summer movie season, this turns out
to be one of the nicer blow-'em-ups around. The characters are
funny and likable, and they all live on Earth. The formula still
has some zip. The stars, with the welcome new addition of Chris
Rock as a young detective who has literally married into the
``Lethal Weapon'' family, play their roles with breezy finesse. And
the story, about slave smuggling and Chinese gangsters, is a
flamboyant, fight-filled adventure fueled by jokey camaraderie and
constant forward motion. Bear in mind that this is still a film
whose idea of high drama is watching a car get pushed in front of
an oncoming train (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `MULAN,' with the voices of Ming-Na Wen, Eddie Murphy and B.D.
Wong. Directed by Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft (G, 86 minutes).
Disney takes a sledgehammer to the subject of gender stereotyping
in this film, which not only breaks the cross-dressing barrier but
also ratchets up the violence level for children's animation. This
is the most inert and formulaic of recent Disney animated films,
right down to the jokey sidekicks, would-be ``Under the Sea''
production number and Destiny ballad from the intrepid heroine
(``When will my reflection show who I am inside?''). Murphy's very
funny wisecracks make the character of a little dragon
entertaining, but this black-sounding character is also treated as
a servile clown. The animation mimics live-action crowd scenes more
often than it takes audiences to the realm of the imagination
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `NIGHTS OF CABIRIA,' starring Giulietta Masina. Directed by
Federico Fellini (not rated; 117 minutes). Anyone dismayed by the
hyperkinetic emptiness of summertime film spectacles will find the
antidote in this 1957 Fellini masterpiece. It has been refurbished
and revived by the same team that brought back ``Contempt'' last
year, and they display the same acumen in reissuing a film of
special prescience; though it was shot in black and white amid the
poverty of postwar Italy, neither the style nor the searching of
``Cabiria' has grown dated at all. In a prize-winning and
heartbreaking performance, the star plays a scrappy Roman
streetwalker who drifts almost magically among the film's
astonishingly varied realms. There is more grace and courage in the
famous image of Masina smiling through her tears than in all the
fire-breathing blockbusters Hollywood has to offer (Maslin).
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `THE OPPOSITE OF SEX,' starring Christina Ricci, Martin Donovan,
Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Directed by Don Roos (R, 100 minutes).
Wicked, foulmouthed and very funny, this gleefully acerbic comedy
finds that Ms. Ricci has morphed enchantingly from nasty little
Wednesday of ``The Addams Family'' into Lolita's evil twin.
Voluptuous and scheming, her poisonous Dedee narrates this film and
announces immediately that she won't be developing a heart of gold.
Which is, of course, mostly a lie. The film brutally skewers
preconceptions about gay and straight life, then lets its
characters intermingle in sweetly unexpected ways. Donovan and Ms.
Kudrow, as unlikely comrades brought together by Dedee's treachery,
deliver the zingers from Roos' screenplay with deadpan panache
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `OUT OF SIGHT,' starring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez.
Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 120 minutes). As directed with
terrific panache by Soderbergh in his most frankly commercial
effort, Clooney and Ms. Lopez take an intricate Elmore Leonard
crime tale and give it steam heat. Like ``Get Shorty,'' this story
has been adapted from a Leonard novel by Scott Frank, who knows
exactly how to capture the writer's shrewd, hard-boiled style on
screen. An outstanding supporting cast _ including Don Cheadle,
Dennis Farina and Albert Brooks _ provides the movie with a vivid
rogues' gallery and remains good fun even when the story is
occasionally confusing. To fill in the blanks, go back to Leonard's
version; there are certainly worse ways to spend a summer afternoon
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `A PERFECT MURDER,' starring Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow
and Viggo Mortensen. Directed by Andrew Davis (R, 107 minutes). The
characters may be cardboard-thin in this film, a skillfully plotted
update of Frederick Knott's play (and Alfred Hitchcock's film)
``Dial M for Murder,'' but the nasty cat-and-mouse games they play
are icily amusing. Douglas, looking more than ever like a wattled,
riled-up rooster, is Steven Taylor, a shady Wall Street bond trader
in deep financial trouble who hires his rich wife's handsome lover
(Mortensen), a con man posing as a painter, to murder her. It's not
as easy as he hopes. Ms. Paltrow, looking chic, is the wife, Emily,
a translator at the United Nations, who has her own agenda. The
story takes enough surprising twists to keep you engrossed, and the
high-style ambiance (especially the Taylors' Fifth Avenue
apartment) is mouthwatering (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS,' starring Anne Heche and Harrison Ford.
Directed by Ivan Reitman (PG-13, 146 minutes). This escapist
romance for the Treadmill Generation is a workout in its own right,
putting its stars through the wringer (and into a ``From Here to
Eternity'' surf clinch complete with hiking boots). The leads are
attractive and funny, and the screenplay strives for a
Tracy-Hepburn dynamic, but this truly strenuous love story is as
long on tropical scenery as it is short on new ideas. Once the
stars are marooned in splendid isolation, the film has to cook up
pirates and a snake in Ms. Heche's shorts just to keep afloat. In
supporting roles, David Schwimmer makes a drippy beau for Ms.
Heche; Temuera Morrison deserves his own pirate picture, and the
ex-grocery clerk Jacqueline Obrados torches up the film as if Salma
Hayek were in town (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SMALL SOLDIERS,' starring Gregory Smith and Phil Hartman.
Directed by Joe Dante (PG-13, 105 minutes). This ably animated film
about action-figure toys who virtually come to life should have
been a sure thing. There are innocent echoes of ``Toy Story'' and
darker ones of the director's own ``Gremlins'' pictures, which had
the witty balance of mischief and horror that ``Small Soldiers''
strangely lacks. The voice talent here is extraordinary, with the
casts of ``The Dirty Dozen'' and ``This Is Spinal Tap'' playing
rival toy factions, and Tommy Lee Jones and Frank Langella as their
respective commanders. But the story remains unfocused and grows
too wan for horror, too creepy for lighthearted fun. Another reason
not to laugh is Hartman's performance in the fatuous role that was
his last (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE TRUMAN SHOW,' starring Jim Carrey. Directed by Peter Weir
(PG, 104 minutes). The ultimate in high-concept ingenuity. Hosannas
and cartwheels for this ingenious media-age fantasy are over the
top, but by comparison with Hollywood's usual notion of summer
movie fare, it's definitely a dazzler. Carrey, refreshingly free of
shtick, gives an instantly iconic performance as a guinea pig for
an entertaifment-happy nation, a man whose whole life is a fraud
contrived by Ed Harris' so-called ``televisionary.'' Carrey's
innate edge of volatility gives the material, from a screenplay of
transfixing sci-fi intensity, its trace of danger. Laura Linney, as
the actress playing a wife whose bluff could be called at any
moment, is the story's spookiest character as well as its perkiest.
Weir unifies the story's many nuances with great finesse (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE X-FILES,' starring David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson.
Directed by Rob Bowman (PG-13, 115 minutes). Conspiracy theorists,
consider this: What if the hush-hush atmosphere and Internet mania
surrounding the first ``X-Files'' feature film were part of a giant
scheme to hide the uneventfulness of a summertime sci-fi fizzle?
It's as possible as much of what this spinoff film has to offer. If
devotees of the television series approach the film with enough
baggage for a six-week safari, maybe they can deepen the experience
of watching a middling action-adventure with brand-name appeal. But
this film will strike true X-fanatics as watered down and remains
fairly bewildering to the uninitiated. And no, Scully and Mulder
don't quite take their working relationship to a higher plane
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   FILM SERIES:
</P>
<P>
   `UNIVERSAL COMEDY.' Twenty-one films and countless laughs.
That's the undertaking in progress at the Film Forum, where the
series ``Universal Comedy'' moves this weekend to classics of the

 &HT;    Coke earnings on target
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola's full-steam-ahead approach to fending off
the ``Asian flu'' paid off in the second quarter, with strong sales
in the region contributing to strong earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company said income rose 4 percent to $1.16
billion, or 47 cents a share, excluding a 2 cent charge and a 3
cent gain. That compares with income of $1.11 billion, or 45 cents
a share, excluding a 7 cent gain, in second quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose 1 percent, to $5.15 billion, from $5.08 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The results were tempered by a 10 percent reduction in operating
income, caused by the U.S. dollar's strength against weakened
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is beyond anyone's control,'' Schroder Wertheim analyst
Carolyn Levy said of Coca-Cola's vulnerability to currency
fluctuations. ``There's too many things going against them at once
for them to be able to manage that.'' She added that another round
of currency devaluations could throw off future earnings.
</P>
<P>
   George Thompson with Prudential Securities was among analysts
who said the company should be able to keep the impact on earnings
from currency fluctuations in the 8 percent to 9 percent range for
all of 1998, as Coca-Cola Chief Financial Officer James E. Chestnut
has predicted. Usually, it's around 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite continued economic strife in some markets, Coca-Cola's
worldwide case sales surged 10 percent, which was the high end of
the range the company projected last month. To Levy, those sales
figures are the important numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earnings are much less important than the volumes,'' she
said. ``If the volumes continue to meet or beat expectations, the
stock will continue to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's shares, which hit a 52-week high Wednesday, closed
at $87.18 3/4 on Thursday, down 62 1/2 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Case sales rose 8 percent in North America, which accounts for
30 percent of Coca-Cola's sales. They rose 12 percent in Latin
America, the second-largest market, and 10 percent in Europe, the
third-largest.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose 7 percent in the Middle and Far East region, despite
a 3 percent dip in Japan, which accounts for an estimated 18 to 20
percent of profits. Coca-Cola recently passed its first price
increase in seven years in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola and its bottlers have been countering the Asian
currency crisis by shifting to more affordable packaging, such as
returnable bottles, while increasing investment dollars in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   More coolers and vending machines are being added, resulting in
a strong second-quarter showing in some emerging markets like China
and India, with sales increases of 28 percent and 33 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with the headwinds of currency, they're able to stimulate
volume growth and cash flow,'' said Andrew Conway, analyst with
Morgan Stanley, who remains bullish on Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Though most analysts exclude gains and charges when weighing
earnings, the company's second-quarter profits actually declined by
9 percent if the gain and charge are factored in. Using that
method, net income was $1.19 billion, or 48 cents per diluted
share, against $1.31 billion, or 52 cents per share, in the
previous period, which also included a 7 cent gain from the sale of
a company-owned bottler.
</P>
<P>
   The second-quarter gain of $78 million, or 3 cents per share,
came from Coca-Cola's sale of its company-owned bottling operations
in northern and central Italy to Coca-Cola Beverages, the company's
10th anchor bottler. CCB has taken over the European business from
Sydney-based anchor Coca-Cola Amatil.
</P>
<P>
   The $50 million charge, amounting to 2 cents per share, covered
a writedown of manufacturing assets.

 &HT;    Valenti: Safeguard intellectual property
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture
Association of America, best known for his role as the czar of
motion picture and television content rating, came to Summer
Internet World in Chicago with a new mission and a new cause:
fighting the theft of intellectual property on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti had been expected to talk about his speciality but
instead told the audience the entertainment industry was worried
the Web was a threat to his industry.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show about 14 percent, or about 13 million Web surfers,
routinely look for information about movies. There are roughly
10,800 corporate and fan sites devoted to movies. Valenti said the
popularity of movie and entertainment sites on the Web could lead
to what he called ''the invasion of the copyright snatchers.'' He
said intellectual property thieves are ``a hazard to America's most
wanted commodity.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenti confessed neither he nor his entertainment industry
colleagues fully understand the power of the Web as it relates to
intellectual property. He made it clear the entertainment community
was not looking to prevent Web development. In fact, he said the
Web would ultimately use more and more streaming, or live, video
and audio components generated by his industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''The movie business is an unpredictable, chancy and expensive
business,'' he said. ''We have to find new revenue streams in order
to survive.'' He suggested pay-per-view movies on the Web were just
one way to generate revenue and help keep intellectual property
issues under control.
</P>
<P>
   Although he floated a few temporary solutions to the question of
property and copyright, in the end Valenti thinks only the
government can keep emerging technologies from co-opting
entertainment content on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ''If these creative enterprises are not protected from
poachers,'' he concluded, ''it will haunt us and shrink computer
choices.''

 COMBAT-READY SPIELBERG REVISITS WORLD WAR II IN `PVT. RYAN'
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By RUTHE STEIN &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR; c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Steven Spielberg first got the urge to make
a movie, at age 13, he didn't have to look far for a subject. His
father, a World War II veteran, had ``intoxicated me with bedtime
stories about the war,'' Spielberg recalls. ``His stories were like
the war movies I was watching on TV _ all worthy of cameo
appearances by John Wayne.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg cast his seventh-grade buddies in a war drama,
``Fighter Squad,'' outfitting them in the leather flier helmets,
big tinted goggles and bomber jackets his father kept around the
house. A year later, in 1960, he featured the war-surplus family
Jeep in ``Escape to Nowhere,'' an action picture in which GIs
invade a Nazi stronghold in the Libyan desert (simulated by the
Arizona desert near his house).
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg's fascination with the war continued after he started
making movies for real. Of the 17 features he has directed, four
(``1941,'' ``Empire of the Sun,'' ``Always'' and the Oscar-winning
``Schindler's List'') have some connection to World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is back with ``Saving Private Ryan,'' his most realistic
depiction yet of his father's war. Set during the Normandy
invasion, the movie follows a ragtag group of soldiers (Tom Hanks,
Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore and Jeremy Davies) on a mission to
rescue the remaining son (Matt Damon) in a family that has lost
three boys in action.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg is flying around the country in a private jet to
advance the film. The last time the publicity-shy director traveled
to promote a film was 17 years ago for ``E.T.,'' and then he made
only a few stops. Determined not to seem like a rich guy, he is
quick to point out that the plane isn't his. ``I don't have a
plane,'' he adds, never mind that with a net worth estimated at $1
billion and films that have grossed almost $5 billion, he could
afford a fleet of them.
</P>
<P>
   Settling into a corner armchair in an elegant hotel suite,
Spielberg establishes eye contact and maintains it without once
looking away. He is dressed formally for him, in a tweed sport coat
and open-collar blue shirt. His hair is graying and he has a bald
spot; yet his earnest, open manner makes him seem more like a kid
than a 51-year-old father of seven.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is part owner of DreamWorks, the studio that is
bringing out ``Saving Private Ryan,'' he hardly can be accused of
hyping the film. In fact, Spielberg says, the main reason he agreed
to tour is that he feels ``a duty to warn people'' about the
graphic battlefield scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want people to know that this movie is extremely close
to reality. It doesn't glorify or titillate, as violence in summer
movies usually does. This movie in effect may resensitize people
who thought they were desensitized to violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The carnage begins almost immediately with a wrenching sequence
on Omaha Beach before any of the characters are developed.
Spielberg says he did this deliberately so the audience would not
be able to sit back as in most movies and just be spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt in a sense that the Omaha Beach landing was not unlike
basic training for an audience, that once they got through that _
if, in fact, they allowed themselves to get through it _ they would
be on the alert just as our kids are aware as they walk through the
hedgerow of France looking for Pvt. Ryan that any moment something
like that could happen to them again.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that ``Saving Private Ryan's'' R rating is
``the hardest R you can be given'' and that the film is ``very much
on the edge,'' he thinks it would have been a shame if it had
received an NC-17. For one thing, it would have kept away people
the same age as a lot of the soldiers who died on Omaha Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for me to say none of my kids (six are younger
than 13) are going to see the picture, and it's also important for
me to say I wouldn't even accompany a 14-year-old to see it. I
would basically make the cutoff point 15.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg believes that he would have enlisted in World War II,
which he was taught was justified. However, he had no such thoughts
about the Vietnam War and tried his best to get out of going.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just that I had objections to that war, I was afraid
of getting killed,'' he says. ``I went to a psychiatrist, you know,
to try to get a letter to get out of Vietnam. After a year with the
psychiatrist, I said, `Look, I'm leaving now, but can I have a
letter that says I'm not fit to serve?' He said, `No, I don't
believe in writing letters.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Spielberg, when a draft lottery was called he
was given a very high number (based on his date of birth). ``That's
the only reason I didn't go to Vietnam,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He ended up in Hollywood instead. If ``Easy Riders, Raging
Bulls,'' a gossipy new book about the wunderkind directors of the
'70s, is to be believed, Spielberg was one of the few who didn't
self-destruct through excessive behavior such as womanizing and
doing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't ever use drugs,'' Spielberg says. ``I had no
curiosity about them, and in fact I had a healthy fear of them
because I wanted to be a director. I thought directing meant total
control, and I felt that if I ever, you know, took drugs I would
lose control and therefore I would lose a chance to be a
filmmaker.''

CAR SAFETY: DWI MOTORISTS LOSE LICENSES, THEN CARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, N.C., Calif.)  (Duplication warning: Also moving in `f' category)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A person convicted more than once of driving under
the influence of alcohol usually faces the suspension or revocation
of his or her driver's license. But many people who lose permission
to drive still get behind the wheel, so a growing number of states
have taken a more forceful response: instead of telling the driver
to hang up the keys, they take away the car.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials say most of the people whose licenses
are suspended or revoked keep on driving. No one knows how many,
and the problem is referred to as an ``invisible violation,'' since
an officer has no way to tell that an unlicensed driver is on the
road, short of pulling the car over and running a check.
</P>
<P>
   Unlicensed drivers constitute a high percentage of a large
number of people. For example, a survey by the National Sheriffs'
Association found recently that in Salt Lake County, Utah, with a
population of 850,000, at any given time an average of 50,000
drivers were suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is particularly frustrating for police.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't surprise me a bit if two-thirds of them still
drive,'' said A.N. Moser Jr., executive director of the
association, referring to people nationwide whose licenses were
suspended or revoked.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if confiscating cars was too extreme, Moser said, ``If
that's their vehicle they're driving, I'd seize that and sell it so
fast it would make their heads swim.'' Repeat drunken drivers
impose a high cost on society in deaths, injuries and property
damage, he said, and the alternative _ locking up the driver _ is
costly, too.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one states permit confiscation of vehicles, according to
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, some for 30
days or longer, and some permanently. A recent study in California
found that taking the car away does not solve the problem, but it
can help.
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Motor Vehicles followed 6,300
drivers whose licenses had been suspended or revoked. Among first
offenders, they found that of those whose cars were not seized by
the courts, within a year about 25 percent were convicted for
driving without a valid license. Among those whose cars were
confiscated, only about 20 percent were convicted for driving
without a license.
</P>
<P>
   Among repeat offenders, seizure was even more effective; again,
about 20 percent of those whose cars were taken were convicted for
driving in the first year, compared with about 30 percent for those
whose cars were not taken.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important measure was the number of crashes.
About 40 percent of those whose cars were seized were involved in a
crash in the next year. For repeat offenders whose cars were not
seized, the figure was about 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A different study found that in 1993, 12 percent of the crash
fatalities in California _ nearly 500 people _ occurred in
collisions involving drivers whose licenses were suspended or
revoked.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Canadian researchers have found that a high
proportion of fatal accidents are caused by hard-core drinkers. In
a 1996 report, the Traffic Injury Research Foundation, in Ottawa,
said, ``Administrative impoundment and immobilization of vehicles
being operated by suspended drivers appears to be an efficient and
effective means of bolstering license suspensions and preventing
repeat DWI behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   But taking a car doesn't always do the trick, Moser said. He
pointed out, with only slight exaggeration, ``In California they
have five vehicles per family.'' And drivers who lose both their
licenses and their cars can still get their hands on the keys to
cars belonging to employers, relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Taking away cars can cause unexpected problems, as North
Carolina discovered this year. A law that took effect last Dec. 1
allowed police to seize vehicles from drivers caught behind the
wheel after their licenses had been suspended for alcohol
violations. The first seizure was made less than two hours after
the bill took effect.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature voted that the cars and trucks should be
given to local school boards, which could auction them and keep the
money. But the school districts complain that under the law they
cannot sell the cars until the drivers are convicted in court, and
that can take months. In fact, at the end of April, more than 2,300
vehicles had been seized in the state and hardly any had been
released for sale. The towing and storage costs exceeded the market
value of many of the vehicles. And school superintendents complain
that they are not familiar with the car auction business, and they
do not want to be.
</P>
<P>
   Also, banks complained that they had a larger interest in many
of the vehicles than the drivers being punished. And North Carolina
and other states have also found it difficult to handle cars that
are owned not by the driver, but by a friend or a rental car
company.
</P>
<P>
   A leader in getting tough with drunken drivers, North Carolina
is now considering changes to its impoundment law.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of seizing cars is spreading, and Congress has
partly endorsed that approach in a new law requiring the states to
enact tougher minimum penalties for drivers convicted twice or more
for alcohol violations. One way for states to meet the requirement
is to enact a vehicle-impoundment law; others include mandatory
license suspensions for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   States that do not pass such laws will have some of their
federal highway construction money diverted to safety programs. The
federal rules take effect on Oct. 1, 2001.

 &HT;    Delta: $1 billion profit for fiscal year
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Delta Air Lines' advertising campaign says passengers
have a ``million different reasons to fly.'' Thursday's earnings
announcement provided a billion reasons why the carrier is glad
they do.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Delta logged its first $1 billion annual profit in
the fiscal year that ended June 30, up 13 percent from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   The milestone was achieved with a fourth-quarter surge that saw
profits climb 20 percent to $362 million, or $4.52 a share, vs.
$301 million, or $3.90 a share, in the same quarter a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the quarter rose to $3.76 billion from $3.54
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Delta also said it filled just over 76 percent of its seats in
the quarter, a record, and 72 percent for the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy ridership, coupled with a continuing decline in fuel
prices and higher overall fares, has boosted profits across the
airline industry this year. Delta paid 52 cents a gallon in the
latest quarter, down from 60 cents a year earlier. Fuel is
typically an airline's second-biggest expense behind labor.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's quarterly result beat Wall Street consensus estimates,
but the carrier's stock descended Thursday. It had surged as high
as $143 earlier this week after Delta announced plans for a 2-for-1
split. Analysts said investors were expecting even better quarterly
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   For the full fiscal year, Delta said the $1 billion profit,
which compared with $854 million a year ago, equated to $12.68 per
share vs. $11.03 a share. Revenue totaled $14.13 billion, up from
$13.59 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Chief Executive Leo F. Mullin said the annual profit
reflects the airline's ``underlying financial strength as well as
our continued ability to deliver strong margins and operating cash
flow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our management team is clearly focused on building upon
Delta's strong core franchise to deliver superior financial
performance while making important investments to strengthen
Delta's customer service, operational performance and technological
infrastructure,'' Mullin said.
</P>
<P>
   The fiscal-year profit will translate to more than $180 million
in profit-sharing payouts to employees, Delta said. The airline has
about 68,000 workers, about 26,000 of them based in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The payouts, which a spokesman said will amount to 6 percent of
annual base salary for domestic workers, will be distributed in
early September. Last year's payout was 5 percent.

 SAN FRANCISCO _ a filmmaker.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg says he is crazy about the directors who came up with
him. George Lucas, with whom he collaborated on the ``Indiana
Jones'' movies, was driving in from Marin County to visit later in
the day, and Spielberg was about to call Francis Ford Coppola to
congratulate him on winning $80 million in his lawsuit against
Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' Spielberg quips, ``Francis has made more money
suing a studio this year than I have made running one.''
</P>
<P>
   While Spielberg is no less intense about filmmaking than he was
in his younger days, he now takes time off to be with his wife,
actress Kate Capshaw, and their large brood. He realized the
necessity of this when he came home after filming one evening and
his 18-month-old ``took one look at me and said, `Bye-bye Daddy.'
That spun me right around.''
</P>
<P>
   So following the one-two punch of ``Jurassic Park'' and
``Schindler's List,'' he didn't make another movie for three years.
Spielberg is in the midst of another hiatus after shooting ``The
Lost World,'' ``Amistad'' and ``Private Ryan'' all in one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned how much I love being at home and how much I love
having my kids know I'm at home. I've been car-pooling all this
year, and I do all the breakfasts in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg has found a way to stay involved even when he has to
go to his office at DreamWorks, where he produces and develops
scripts. ``We have a big blackboard in the kitchen where
everybody's activities are charted. So when I get home from work, I
know where they have been and can talk to them about their play
dates. If my day was casting `Private Ryan,' we'll talk about
casting `Private Ryan.'
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our kids are leaders. We have no followers, which makes
our family very noisy. It would be an interesting sitcom. Every day
something amazing happens and I think, `My God, if that were on TV,
I'd be on the floor laughing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg and Capshaw have been married nine years; it is by
most accounts a happy marriage, unlike his first one to actress Amy
Irving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love at first sight is a wonderful thing for romance novels,''
he says, ``but marriages truly only work when you work at them. If
I'm making a picture, the family is with me. That is totally key.
You can't be off four months away from each other making phone
calls every day. You can't have a marriage on the telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, Spielberg will take his family to Japan, where he
will begin shooting ``Memoirs of a Geisha,'' based on the
best-selling novel. ``It's a wonderful melodrama,'' he says, ``and
I've never done a real melodrama.''

   THE LUXURY OF STOPPING: A Ross McElwee documentary is just about
perfect for video. Since he usually chronicles his own life in
films like ``Sherman's March'' (1986) and ``Time Indefinite''
(1993), the dramas couldn't be more intimate. Given McElwee's eye
for odd happenings and juxtapositions, the scenarios are also
provocative enough to make one want to pause and ruminate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pleases me that on video people have the luxury of
stopping,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His latest documentary ``6 O'Clock News'' (1997), recently
released on videotape by First Run Features, fits neatly because it
is about the medium of television. In fact, unlike his earlier
films, it didn't get an extensive theater showing primarily because
it was first broadcast on the ``Frontline'' television series.

   In this context ``news'' refers to disasters. Fires rage,
schoolyards are sprayed with automatic weapons fire and in South
Carolina there has been a hurricane called Hugo. McElwee gets news
of the devastation on television in Boston and decides to take his
camera and fly down to check on the fortunes of Charleen Swansea,
his formep high-school English teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Swansea, a fixture in McElwee films, lives on an island near
Charleston. He finds her in a state of dread over conflicting and
inaccurate reports of total destruction. Ferried out to the island,
she finds her place damaged but standing.
</P>
<P>
   On top of everything else, the storm is rumored to have produced
grapefruit-size balls of ants that are attacking people.
Corroboration fails to materialize about this and other tales, but
as he wanders about, McElwee begins to notice how the storm has
totally destroyed entire blocks and left other areas directly next
to them virtually untouched.
</P>
<P>
   From this observation springs rapidly evolving McElweeian
reflections on the total randomness of life and the deceptiveness
of appearances. That starts him watching the news all the more
intently for people and situations that appeal to his sense of
fate. Spotting a scene of particular pathos, he packs his camera
and goes off to get to know the afflicted.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's lost love (``Sherman's March'') or the vagaries of
sudden personal tragedy (``Time Indefinite''), McElwee films take
their surprises, which are sometimes considerable, without missing
a beat.
</P>
<P>
   In ``6 O'Clock News'' he goes to Arkansas to film and interview
Steve Im, a Korean merchant whose wife was killed during a robbery
attempt at their store in Mississippi. Describing his feelings at
the sight of Im's face on the news, McElwee says that he feels
compelled to find out what has become of this tortured,
forlorn-looking man whose life was torn apart that day several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport, he is met by a dapper businessman in a
chauffeured Lincoln. Im, it seems, now owns a restaurant and a
pulp-wood business and is worth $6 million. The woman who stays
sedately in the background is his new wife, Miss Korea of 1974.
``She's good with the children, this one,'' Kim says.
</P>
<P>
   McElwee takes it all in and moves along to other victims around
the country. Always there are questions of perception and reality.
Earlier in the film, the 6 o'clock news in his town has heard about
this filmmaker who chronicles his own life. They want to do a
feature about him, and he invites them into his house, filming them
as they film him. The interviewer asks the usual question: When is
he going to give up documentaries and go to Hollywood to make a
real film?

   It's Dickens a go-go in Florida as young Finn (Pip in the novel)
grows up artistically inclined and hopelessly smitten with the
lovely, haughty Estella. Miss Havisham is now Nora Dinsmoor (Anne
Bancroft), spruced up and ready to party, and Magwitch, Dickens'
escaped convict, is called Lustig (Robert De Niro) and has mob
connections. Later, in New York, Finn (played as an adult by Ethan
Hawke) electrifies the art world and again encounters Estella
(Gwyneth Paltrow), who's still haughty but a little nicer. In sum,
Alfonso Cuaron's film is saved by it's look, which, Janet Maslin
wrote in The New York Times, ``makes up in visual exoticism some of
what it loses in character and context.''

   To protest government death squads and torture, students kidnap
the U.S. ambassador to Brazil (Alan Arkin), which happened in 1969.
What is achieved is arguable as the dissidents are caught and
tortured themselves. In real life, democracy didn't return until
1989, partly because, Bruno Barreto's film suggests, student
terrorism only fueled the tyranny. As for his gripping but often
clumsy semi-fictional account, it ``presents a disturbingly
ambiguous and unromantic portrait of retaliation against
oppression'' (Stephen Holden). &QL;

GOVERNORS URGE SENATE TO AMEND BILL ON INTERNET TAXATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's governors urged the Senate on Thursday
not to adopt a six-year ban on new Internet taxes, saying states
could lose billions of dollars as commerce on the Internet
explodes.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Scheppach, executive director of the National Governors'
Association, told the Senate Finance Committee that states already
lose $4 billion annually from not being able to tax mail-order
sales. And he estimated that by 2002, states would lose between $15
and $20 billion in revenue from a sales-tax ban on both mail-order
and Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce on the Internet continues to grow as consumers
increasingly turn to their computers to buy goods ranging from
stocks to books. By the year 2002, $300 billion worth of business
will be conducted on computers, according to Commerce Department
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Scheppach urged the committee to drop the Senate's proposal for
a six-year ban on Internet taxes and adopt a measure similar to a
House bill that calls for a three-year moratorium on new Internet
taxes. The House bill also would ban the practice of making
customers pay taxes in both the resident state and the state from
which the good arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Scheppach also warned against a permanent ban on Internet taxes,
saying retail businesses that were unable to sell their products
over the computer would be at a ``perpetual disadvantage'' to
competitors who were on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Harley Duncan, executive director of the Federation of Tax
Administrators, an organization that represents state tax
collecting agencies, also criticized the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Senate measure used very broad language that would
make it difficult for state tax agencies to interpret which types
of business transactions on the Internet should be taxed.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan also called on the Senate to pass a measure similar to
the House bill, which he said would provide tax collectors a better
idea of what can and cannot be taxed.
</P>
<P>
   The House measure, which was passed in June, also would
establish a temporary two-year commission, made up of business
executives and officials from state and local governments, that
would work on ways to fairly tax the sale of goods on the Internet.

NEW YORK VIDEO FESTIVAL OFFERS A UNIVERSE OF INTIMATE VIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Calif.)   (js)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nearly 20 years ago, a catchy hit song called ``Video
Killed the Radio Star'' by a group called the Buggles eerily
presaged the rise of MTV and the revolution in pop-music marketing
that the promotional video clip was just beginning to incite.
Today, when the mindless star-studded ``event movie'' has risen to
become the economic cornerstone of the film industry, the time is
more than ripe for an upstart video artist to concoct a similar
fantasy that might be dubbed, ``Video Killed the Movie Star.''
</P>
<P>
   In the world of the $20-million-a-picture movie-star salary,
that's not going to happen any time soon. But as suggested by the
work shown in the New York Video Festival, which opens Friday at
the Walter Reade Theater, video art, that unruly stepchild of
television and experimental cinema, has flowered into a vast,
immensely creative alternative culture. At its most inventive, as
in ``Flat Is Beautiful,'' Sadie Benning's 50-minute video evocation
of preadolescent angst in a nontraditional Midwest household,
experimental form and conventional narrative fuse into something
extraordinarily original and touching.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the bewildering array of styles, technologies and
attitudes in the festival, which runs through Thursday and is a
part of Lincoln Center Festival '98, you almost have a sense of the
universe expanding at the speed of light after a spontaneous
explosion. Within the territory being mapped, there's nary a movie
star to be found.
</P>
<P>
   While it's risky to generalize about the flowering of video art,
a few broad trends seem obvious. The home video camera leads people
into much more intimate and quirkier spaces than the movie camera.
Where movies monumentalize their subjects, video banalizes them,
reducing everything to a collection of dancing pixels. Where movies
are great at conjuring beautiful dreams, videos tune us in to the
gritty day-to-day texture of ``the real world,'' as defined by
television. But paradoxically, in the hands of a subversive artist,
it is equally adept at challenging the narrow Darwinian vision of
life that saturates commercial television.
</P>
<P>
   Video art lends itself to work of raw, punkish nonsense, as in
the program of eight bizarre shorts, ``Faultlines in the Psyche,''
but it can also yield work of rigorously elegant abstraction. In a
program called ``The Persistence of Vision,'' the seductive images
run from the whimsical abstractions of Michael Intriere's ``Fish''
(schools of fish photographed swimming against a woozy, waterlogged
pop instrumental soundtrack) to visually transfixing, even romantic
meditations on technology.
</P>
<P>
   As gorgeous as any fireworks display, Van McElwee's
``Transfinite Loops'' invents dazzling astral patterns and finds a
mood of deepening sadness in the swirling, overlapping images of
amusement park rides photographed at night and accompanied by the
sound of howling wind.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bain's ``Space Probing,'' which was photographed in a dense
tangle of ducts, pipes and machinery beneath the campus of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, creates a shifting, kinetic,
kaleidoscopic landscape that suggests a continually re-configuring
Cubist painting that at moments seems almost three-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
   On a more austere, experimental level, Les LeVeque's ``Flight''
takes the shimmering low-resolution black-and-white television
image of a lunar astronaut and, to the sounds of accompanying
static, stretches it into two figures.
</P>
<P>
   If ``The Persistence of Vision'' represents one pole of the work
shown in the Video Festival, three programs _ ``The Good, the Bad
and the Converted,'' ``Frontier Meditations'' and ``Gimme Shelter''
_ bring fresh concepts to the documentary form.

NEW YORK: documentary form. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeanne Finley and John Muse's ``O Night Without Objects,'' the
centerpiece of ``The Good, the Bad and the Converted,'' tells the
true story of a rabidly anti-Semitic grand dragon of the Ku Klux
Klan in Lincoln, Neb., who underwent a spiritual and political
transformation, converted to Judaism, and was taken in and cared
for until his death by a local cantor and his family. The story,
which probes deeply into this family's complicated dynamics, is
framed by abstract essays on family psychology (the opening segment
of this triptych shows a psychological test being given to a child
who is asked to describe what's happening in certain ambiguous
pictures), society and religious community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frontier Meditations'' consists entirely of the Russian
director Alexander Sokurov's five-and-a-half -hour documentary
``Spiritual Voices: The Diaries of War,'' a rigorous, glacially
paced meditation on the personal ravages of war on individual
soldiers. The movie opens with a nearly one-hour shot of a desolate
snow-covered landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of ``Gimme Shelter'' is ``The Final Insult,'' a
disturbing, quasi-documentary on homelessness and the apathy of the
impoverished by American filmmaker Charles Burnett. Narrated by a
fictional character, a low-level bank employee named Box Brown
whose financial woes have left him homeless and forced to live in
his car, ``The Final Insult'' blends fiction and truth so craftily
that it's impossible to tell the actors from the nonactors. But its
portrait of people living on the streets (and under the freeway) of
Los Angeles is depressingly realistic. It shows how homelessness
could happen to almost anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the festival's longer works are more notable for what
they attempt than for what they achieve. ``Tomorrow and Tomorrow,''
by Dominique Cabrera, is a personal video diary, filmed with a
hand-held camera, of a year in which Ms. Cabrera suffered from
paralyzing bouts of depression. The work captures the texture of
her daily life (with luminous close-up images of household objects)
and the roller-coaster mood swings of someone desperately trying to
pull her life together. For all its candor, the work still seems
fragmentary and incohesive.
</P>
<P>
   Equally ambitious, although wildly different in intent, the
Belgian video artist Johan Grimonprez's ``Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y,'' in
the program ``Secret Histories,'' is an intellectually pretentious
documentary history of airplane hijackings (accompanied by
heavy-handed readings from the works of Don DeLillo). Illustrating
how televised disasters have forced us to redefine what constitutes
a genuine personal drama and to re-think our notions of personal
autonomy, the work has a haranguing tone; after a while, the old
newsreel and television clips of hijack survivors recounting their
ordeals fades into a blur.
</P>
<P>
   Much more satisfying and far scarier is Maria Venuto's half-hour
video film, ``The Tourist,'' which is based on a true incident in
1993. Arriving at Kennedy International Airport, a young German
tourist who has fled her domineering family is fleeced of her money
by a taxi driver and returns to the terminal where she spends the
next three weeks composing unsent postcards home describing her
glorious new life in New York. Having subsisted on Pizza Hut
leftovers and sleeping in the terminal, she is eventually thrown
out into the cold by a security guard. This portrait of
helplessness is so merciless it becomes nightmarishly funna.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the high point of this uneven festival is Ms.
Benning's ``Flat Is Beautiful,'' which explores the world of a
tomboyish 11-year-old girl named Sammy Steel, who lives with her
divorced mother and the mother's gay male roommate. The most
inspired conceit of this technically crude video film is to have
all the characters wear cartoonish masks. Along with the
characters' face gear, the videography, which focuses on
billboards, store signs and flat surfaces, creates the feeling of
living in a children's cartoon world where reality is
simultaneously hiddel and revealed in a twisted, more intensely
felt stylization.
</P>
<P>
   If the same devices were employed in a glossier film, they
wouldn't have nearly the same emotional impact. But because ``Flat
Is Beautiful'' has the look, feel and sound of an intimate home
video, it draws you into a private world thatfeels at once strange
and profoundly recognizable.

THE JESUS AND MARY CHAIN:   SCOTTISH PUNK NIHILISTS CALL ON
TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (js) 
By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Jesus and Mary Chain, the Scottish rock band that
headlined Irving Plaza on Wednesday night, started out in the
mid-1980s as a one-trick band, burying sulky rock songs in feedback
and distortion. By the mid-1990s, it had changed to a different
tactic, stripping away the guitar noise to prove that the songs
could stand on their own. And by now, through sheer recalcitrance,
the Jesus and Mary Chain is starting to sound like a band of
die-hard rock classicists, dedicated to the verities of three
chords, an implacable beat, a drone and an attitude. Two songs,
``Moe Tucker'' and ``Stardust Remedy,'' cited the Velvet
Underground, the revered fountainhead for punk primitivism.
</P>
<P>
   Punk was from the beginning a divided rebellion. Bands like the
Ramones were iconoclastic toward their 1970s contemporaries but
devout about earlier rock 'n' roll. The British punks that followed
them had less humor, more rage and less respect for roots, but the
Jesus and Mary Chain, who arrived in the post-punk era, kept
British punk nihilism in their lyrics while their music held on to
rock's past. For the Jesus and Mary Chain, the Velvets and the
Beach Boys were always as important as the Sex Pistols.
</P>
<P>
   At Irving Plaza, where the band was headlining as part of the
Intel New York Music Festival, the Jesus and Mary Chain maintained
its usual demeanor. The lighting usually kept the band members'
faces in shadows; the group's two singers and songwriters, William
and Jim Reid, spoke only to introduce their sister Linda, who sang
``Moe Tucker.'' Luckily, the band's routine also calls for
absolutely dependable, powerful musicianship.
</P>
<P>
   In songs from the band's new album, ``Munki'' (Sub Pop), Jim
Reid sang, by turns, about self-hatred and misanthropy _ ``I want
to kiss my darkened soul/I want to kill my darkened soul'' _ but
the music never had any identity crisis. It was implacable midtempo
rock, with William Reid's guitar and Ben Lurie's bass often just
sharing a repeated resonant note, not a chord, in octaves; Nick
Sanderson's drumming was steady, austere and unstoppable.

<P>
   The songs buzzed and droned, rising from monotone melodies to
understatedly catchy choruses, with their surly attitude belied by
the stolidity of the music. And to prove that they hadn't forgotten
their noise phase, the band ended its two final songs with
feedback: one with sustained, throbbing consonances, and then the
final one with a dissonant extended screech. It wasn't anything
like a shock anymore, just a new extension of rock traditionalism.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the music festival's computer theme, one song, the
well-chosen ``Virtually Unreal,'' was made available on the
festival's Web site (www.intelfest.com) the same night as the show,
and will be available for a week. Heard through a computer sound
card, it still buzzes and drones, but it doesn't capture the
enveloping sensation of one repeated chord resonating in the club
itself.

U.S. URGED TO BUY OUT HOMES IN FLOOD-PRONE AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Texas, Mo., N.J., N.Y., Fla., Mass., Miss., Calif.,
Ill., S.C., Pa., Conn., Va., N.C.)  (bl) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tens of thousands of homes across the nation have
been flooded again and again while their owners repeatedly
collected federal flood insurance payments, often in amounts
exceeding the total value of the houses, an environmental group
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Wildlife Federation, which based its report on a
comprehensive analysis of government computer records, called on
federal agencies to further expand their relatively new programs
for buying houses in areas prone to flooding and letting low-lying
land revert to a natural state.
</P>
<P>
   Since the devastating Midwest flooding of 1993 shook up federal
flood protection and relief programs, the government has purchased
17,000 properties in flood plains, and Congress is considering
Clinton administration requests to expand this approach instead of
building ever more dams and levees.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management
Agency are both seeking new funds to expand purchases of
flood-prone homes. In May, Michael Armstrong, FEMA's associate
director for mitigation, told a congressional committee that the
agency saves at least $2 in avoided costs for every dollar it
spends removing frequently flooded buildings, and that FEMA could
use up to an additional $300 million for such purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The wildlife group said its study, titled Higher Ground, proved
that many thousands of homes remain susceptible.
</P>
<P>
   The study's authors said Friday that unless more of vulnerable
homes were purchased by the government instead of remaining
insured, losses to the federally operated insurance program, which
is supposed to break even but is already hundreds of millions of
dollars in debt to the Treasury, would continue to mount.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There is a way out: voluntary buyouts, which serve people in
distress, save the taxpayers money, and create environmental
benefits,'' said David Conrad, the wildlife group's project
director.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited 300 communities where the wildlife group saw
high potential for voluntary buyouts of properties because so many
homes were flooded again and again. The areas around New Orleans
and Houston topped the list, but communities in 35 states were
deemed to offer good buyout opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   In one extraordinary case, the records showed that a house in
Houston was flooded 16 times in 18 years, its owner receiving
insurance payments of $806,591 although the house was only worth
$114,480. (Under privacy laws, the government did not disclose the
addresses of the homes in its database or the owners' names.)
</P>
<P>
   The study documented 5,629 homes, or almost 10 percent of the
houses flooded more than once, where cumulative flood insurance
payments exceeded each building's value. In all, these homes were
valued at $307.5 million but received $416.4 million in insurance
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The group examined files on 58,975 single family homes that were
flooded at least twice during any 10-year period between 1978 and
1995 and whose owners won claims for at least $1,000 each time. In
total, these houses received $2.6 billion in flood insurance
payments, the authors said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of FEMA, which runs the program, did not dispute the
report's findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, we think that what they are saying
supports where we are headed,'' said Andrew Sachs, a FEMA official.
``It is in all of our interests to get those structures out of the
flood plain.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the repeated insurance claims were in 15
states: Louisiana and Texas, the study found, followed by Missouri,
New Jersey, New York, Florida, Massachusetts, Mississippi,
California, Illinois, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Connecticut,
Virginia and North Carolina. These states accounted for 90 percent
of the total payments for repetitive floods, according to the
study.

<P>
   After studying 4,000 people in eight countries, a team of
scholars at Associates for Research Into the Science of Enjoyment,
in Reading, England, has determined that people should try to do
things that make them happy.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers studied such activities as sex, drinking wine,
eating chocolate, watching television and having a cup of tea or
coffee, and determined that ``there is a wealth of evidence to
suggest that the cumulative effect of these little pleasures and
happy moments can make us all live longer.''
</P>
<P>
   They neglected to define ``suggest'' and ``can,'' lapses that do
leave a little room for doubt. Among the specifics they mentioned,
however, was the finding that men and rich people like sex and
women and poor people like to shop.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the course of exactly nine (not eight and not 10,
either) years, reports Men's Fitness magazine, Swedes who spent the
least amount of time playing an instrument or attending a concert
or going to a museum or participating any cultural activity were
1.5 times as likely to die as those who did.

GORE PREACHES AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION VIRTUES TO NAACP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Al Gore can preach.
</P>
<P>
   In a week of revelations for delegates to the NAACP national
convention here, this was perhaps the least expected: The vice
president, famous for lacking the ease and eloquence his boss is
famous for, wowed this crowd, and, in the estimation of many,
burnished his credentials among a constituency perhaps crucial to
his presidential hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, striking a decidedly partisan tone and adopting the
vernacular of a black Baptist preacher, delivered a hard-hitting
speech on civil rights that mocked critics of affirmative action
and rebuffed the notion that American is colorblind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard critics of affirmative action,'' he said. ``I've
heard those who say that, `Yes, it is a colorblind society.' They
use their colorblind the way duck hunters use their duck blind.
They hide behind it and hope the ducks won't notice what they're up
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are in favor of affirmative action if you can dunk the
basketball or sink a three-point shot. But they are not in favor of
it if you merely have the potential to be a leader in this
community and bring people together.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's were arguably the most emphatic remarks either he or
Clinton has ever offered on the subject of affirmative action. The
crowd of more than 4,000 was moved to some 15 standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the speech was a chance to prove that he is capable of
building the kind of bond with black voters that seems second
nature to Clinton. Gore earlier this year made a highly successful
Martin Luther King Jr. Day speech at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   With Coretta Scott King seated at the dais, Gore announced that
Clinton Thursday authorized creation of a national monument to
King, her late husband, on the site of the National Mall where he
gave his famous ``I Have A Dream'' speech.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also announced that the Small Business Administration was
entering into an agreement with the NAACP and other black
organizations to make available $4.1 billion in loan assistance to
minority-owned businessed by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose warm reception here upstaged most other major
speakers during the final day of NAACP's six-day gathering touched
on all of the major issues raised here.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed regret for the government's treatment of black
farmers, who are part of a multibillion-dollar discrimination
lawsuit against the Agriculture Department, pledging that ``this is
a problem we will solve, and not bury.''
</P>
<P>
   He lamented the spread of AIDS and HIV among African-Americans,
and promised to continue working to fix crumbling schools and
enhance the quality of teaching and education that many of
America's black children receive.
</P>
<P>
   And in a swipe at the GOP, Gore said: ``The Republicans know
that theirs is the wrong agenda for African Americans, that's why
they don't even want to count you in the census.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore referred to the ongoing controversy over whether the
traditional census count, which has tended to undercount
minorities, should be supplemented by statistical sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Comunications Director Lawrence Haas brushed aside talk
that Gore's speech amounted to an early appeal black votes in 2000.
``His political interest is in 1998. Past 1998, he will address at
a later time. That will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, however, has methodically traveled the south shoring up
black support in an effort to ward off any potential primary
challenge in his home region _ particularly from the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, who is himself considering a presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   Black voters, who made up about 10 percent of the total vote in
the last two presidential elections, make up 50 percent of the vote
in the south. In 1992 and 1996 Clinton garnered 82 to 83 of the
black vote, said David Bositis, senior research associate for the
Joint Center of Political and Economic Studies, a black think tank
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, in all honesty, he should be president,'' said George
Bush, an NAACP delegate from Biloxi, Miss. ``Tell him,'' he added,
laughing, ``that you talked to George Bush and he highly recommends
Al Gore'' for president.
</P>
<P>
   Patrice Lombard, an NAACP delegate from Gulfport, Miss. said
after Gore's speech, ``We're going to get him back in office _ as
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore often spoke in religious terms to a gathering which began
and ended its days with prayers and hymns. He closed with a booming
call to arms for affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three times,'' he said, ``the Republicans tried to roll back
affirmative action this year, and three times we fought back. Hear
me well, if they try again, we'll fight them again...and again, and
again, and again.''

IN SHIFT, CHINA ANNOUNCES CRACKDOWN ON SMUGGLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ After years of tolerating a steady growth of
lawlessness at their borders, China's leaders Friday announced a
war on smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharp indictment of how corrupt and ineffectual Chinese
Customs officials have become, the leaders announced that a new
anti-smuggling police force would be formed. President Jiang Zemin,
addressing a special meeting of top leaders, outlined the problem
in a way that showed how border guards have simply become unwilling
or unable to perform their job.
</P>
<P>
   A major reason the smuggling situation has become so desperate,
Jiang pointed out, is that many of the worst offenders are party
officials and army officers. It was the first time that a top
Chinese official had publicly referred to the extensive role that
China's military plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is confronted by rampant smuggling that involves the
participation of some party, government and army organizations, as
well as judicial and law enforcement departments,'' Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the volume of goods smuggled into China cannot be
measured, officials and business executives estimate that it has
reached tens of billions of dollars a year. The main contraband is
not drugs or arms but rather consumer goods that face such onerous
import duties that it pays to bribe Customs officers or to pay off
army transport officers, who can escape scrutiny at the border.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarettes, gold and automobiles were among the heavily smuggled
items cited at the meeting. Yet a wide range of industrial and
consumer items like telecommunications equipment, diesel oil and
chemicals are also smuggled in enormous quantities.
</P>
<P>
   Even cigarettes produced in China are a major item. To avoid
domestic taxes, many cigarette makers export more than half their
output, only to smuggle the cigarettes back into China, thus
avoiding both domestic and import duties.
</P>
<P>
   With smuggling so rampant and so deeply entrenched in the
interests of powerful authorities, it is not clear how effective
Beijing's new campaign will be. The size and scope of the new
police force is vague; no director was named.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the first five months of this year, Chinese Customs
confiscated $350 million of smuggled goods, a small fraction of the
overall volume. In an report this week, Customs officers blamed
local officials who often blocked investigations.
</P>
<P>
   As with any national campaign, there may be several political
elements at work. Yet decision-making in China remains so opaque
that it is impossible to know if the driving force is Jiang's
desire to flex his muscles over the military or buttress his
reputation as a corruption-fighter.
</P>
<P>
   There may also be financial concerns. Prime Minister Zhu Rongji
argued that it was necessary to reverse the drastic drop in tax
collection as the government undertakes a huge spending program to
encourage economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carrying out the anti-smuggling struggle throughout the whole
country with the speed of lightning is related to achieving this
year's economic growth target,'' Zhu told the meeting.
``Increasingly rampant smuggling activities have already caused
serious harm to many aspects of China's economy, society and
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhu said all party and government offices and law enforcement
agencies would be required to sever ties with affiliated business
companies in an effort to root out official protection of
smuggling. Yet in China's complex morass of companies that are
owned and partly owned by the government, that will be a gargantuan
task.
</P>
<P>
   Fines and proceeds from confiscated goods, Zhu said, will be
divided in a formula: 50 percent to equip anti-smuggling police and
reward individuals and departments that help, 20 percent to pay for
anti-smuggling efforts by provincial governments and 30 percent for
the central government.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, a People's Daily account of the meeting noted the
attendance of leaders of the Xinjiang Production and Construction
Military Group, the only organization to be named. Xinjiang, a vast
area in the northwest that borders Russia and Kazahkstan, is a
center for smuggling, and mentioning the paramilitary group
suggested that it has been playing a role in smuggling itself.
</P>
<P>
   Diesel oil has been flowing into China from refineries in other
parts of Asia even though a ban on imports took effect in February.
Smuggled oil is much cheaper than domestically produced oil, whose
price is set artificially high by the government, and illegal sales
have severely hurt domestic refineries.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial in Friday's issue of People's Daily said smuggling
eroded tax revenues, violated import-export management policies
corrupted officials and undermined social morals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general public must fully realize that the anti-smuggling
drive is not only a major economic struggle, but also a harsh
political struggle that will have a great bearing on the reform,
opening-up and modernization drive,'' the editorial said.

AGENCY CITES LOW COST OF DEMOCRATIC HEALTH CARE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Congressional Budget Office Thursday estimated
that the average consumer would pay less than $25 a year extra for
health insurance under the Democratic managed-care bill.
</P>
<P>
   The report ``shows that the wild claims of the opponents about
the high cost of the legislation are wrong, and that previous
independent estimates of minimal cost are right,'' said Senator
Edward M. Kennedy, sponsor of the Democrats' version of a
``patients' bill of rights,'' which would require managed-care
plans to provide certain rights and benefits to patients.
</P>
<P>
   The CBO estimated that premiums for a typical employer-sponsored
health plan would rise by 4 percent because of the mandates in the
bill. But the CBO also estimated that employers would deflect 60
percent of that increase by taking different steps, such as
reducing benefits or increasing the worker's share of the premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans had charged that the mandates in the bill
would cost consumers an additional $100 per month in premiums.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans released their version of the bill Thursday,
as President Clinton attended a noon pep rally at the Capitol to
press for passage of the leading Democratic plan.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders had opposed any type of health-care
legislation until recent polls showed the GOP was vulnerable on the
issue in this election year. Polls indicate that consumers want
more protection for patients enrolled in managed-care programs,
such as health maintenance organizations, even if the protection
raises their fees and insurance premiums. When Senate Republicans
unveiled their version of the bill Wednesday, they even used the
same title as the Democrats, the patient bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican leadership has been pulled into this issue
kicking and screaming,'' Kennedy said after the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Although the major Democratic and Republican bills differ on
major points, particularly the right of a patient to sue a
managed-care provider for inadequate care, and the number of
mandates, the fact that the GOP now wants to pass a bill has given
the issue a boost.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican bill would create association health plans
to allow small businesses and the self-employed to pool together to
buy health insurance. The Senate Republican bill would allow
unlimited access to medical savings accounts, the IRA-style
accounts for health care.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his third trip to Capitol Hill to tout the
legislation, urged Republicans to join Democrats in crafting a
consensus bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe this is a partisan issue any place but
Washington, D.C.,'' said Clinton. ``We need to stop this from being
a partisan political issue ... It's a people issue. It's about the
integrity of the health care system. It's about how people feel
about our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Blakeney, the principal public health nurse for the
Boston Public Health Commission, spoke for the American Nurses
Association at the rally: ``America's nurses are passionate about
this issue. And we vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Two House Republicans joined the Democrats' rally _
Representatives Michael Forbes, the New York lawmaker who broke
with House Speaker Newt Gingrich over Gingrich's ethics problems
two years ago, and Greg Ganske of Iowa, a plastic and
reconstructive surgeon who specializes in fixing cleft palates _
surgery he said some HMOs refuse to cover because it is
``cosmetic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For heaven's sakes,'' said Ganske, ``insurance should mean
something!''
</P>
<P>
   Ganske said his planned appearance at the rally had caused ``a
firestorm among some members of the Republican caucus.'' As a
result, Ganske said, he resigned Wednesday from a commission
charged with reforming Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   He said no one demanded that he quit, but some Republican
commission members ``questioned, `How can you be in a high-profile
post on the Medicare commission and stand there with the president,
against us?' ''
</P>

   Jay Leno: Nice guy.
</P>
<P>
   That's what everyone says about him. Popular wisdom says the
``Tonight Show'' host is one of the most decent celebrities around
_ a hardworking everyman who's never too busy to sign an autograph
or pose for a photo.
</P>
<P>
   I can think of at least three or four friends of mine who have
pictures of themselves with Jay. Arms tossed around each other, big
grins. These aren't people who work in the media and would have
special access to Leno _ they're fans who have met him in the Billy
Goat or at Mr. Beef or somewhere in LA.
</P>
<P>
   They all had the same thing to say about their encounter. It was
pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   You never hear about Leno brushing off a fan in some diner or
being rude to a waitress. He's more likely to don an apron and
pitch in behind the counter for a half hour, all the while posing
for snapshots and cracking jokes and reminding everyone what time
every night he's on NBC-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I've long thought there's also something disturbing about
the guy. Any grown man who would hide in a closet to eavesdrop on a
conversation between network executives, as Leno did when he was up
for the job as Johnny Carson's replacement, has a bit of a dark and
sneaky side, wouldn't you say?
</P>
<P>
   There's also a dichotomy between the ever-grinning Leno who
comes out before a show's taping in denim work shirt and blue
jeans, working the crowd, and the often mean-spirited monologuist.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment lore says Leno trumped David Letterman in the
ratings in July, 1995, with the infamous ``What the hell were you
thinking!'' interview of then-scandalized Hugh Grant. While that
show did give Leno a ratings boost, he actually started gaining
steadily on Letterman earlier that year _ when he peppered each
night's monologue with joke after joke about the O.J. Simpson
trial. Who can forget the Dancing Itos?
</P>
<P>
   Letterman, the supposedly mean one, refused to do O.J. jokes for
months, despite pleadings from his staff. ``I just don't think
double murder is funny,'' said Dave.
</P>
<P>
   Leno had no such moral qualms; he mined the trial for every
nugget of humor he could find, never worrying about stepping into
tasteless territory. By the time Letterman gave up his stance and
started cracking wise on O.J., it was too late. The ratings war was
over.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Letterman was the one who held off for so long
on the O.J. jokes, all the headlines about Leno said, ``Nice Guys
Finish First.''
</P>
<P>
   You want further proof Jay's a good guy? Consider how he reacted
last week when he was criticized for a joke he made after attending
Harley-Davidson's 95th Anniversary Reunion in Milwaukee. Leno said
that while he feels fat in Los Angeles, all those big bikers in
Brat-town made him feel thin by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. He called some bikers fat. You know what? Some of 'em
are.
</P>
<P>
   But Leno reportedly received reams of mail from Milwaukeeans who
were steamed about the remark, including some nasty threats. He was
also criticized in the Milwaukee media.
</P>
<P>
   Weird. It seems as if half the jokes Leno made on his most
recent visit to Chicago were about our love of pizza and beef and
other thick foods, and I can't recall a single complaint. Guess
they're touchier in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Super-nice Jay's reaction to the criticism? Major mea culpas. He
telephoned Milwaukee Journal Sentinel columnist Joyce
Evans-Campbell to apologize, telling her, ``I didn't mean anything
by it. It was a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Leno called a thin biker who was featured in
Evans-Campbell's column, to apologize to him. How nice can you get?
</P>
<P>
   Well. I guess it depends on whose looks you're mocking. Even as
the biker controversy was brewing, Leno had this to say about the
sex scandal in Washington: ``Linda Tripp testified last week. For a
minute, I thought they were rerunning the movie `Tootsie.'''
</P>
<P>
   And: ``Linda Tripp has her own Web site on the Internet. There's
one Web site you pray they don't have nude pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny. Cheap. Easy.
</P>
<P>
   So in other words, it's all right to mock the physical
appearance of a stout woman, even if that woman is the mother of
two children, but you should apologize if you make fun of
big-bodied bikers.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting how the mind of a nice guy works sometimes.

CONGRESSMAN AIMS AT SAN FRANCISCO'S DOMESTIC PARTNERS ORDINANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Republican congressman wants to ban federal
housing money from San Francisco because of the city's gay-rights
ordinance requiring that companies with city contracts provide the
same benefits to workers with unmarried partners as they do to
married employees.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif., said in an interview Thursday that
he is pushing the money ban because San Francisco is ``trying to
force a particular political belief, a doctrine if you will,'' on
others.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs said he plans to attach the funding ban to an
appropriations bill such as the one to fund the departments of
housing and urban development and veterans affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs, who represents California's North Coast from Napa to the
Oregon border, said he is retiring from Congress at the end of this
year to return to his real estate business.
</P>
<P>
   He denied his plan was an attack on gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's sexual orientation is their own private business,''
he said, adding that he has ``no problem'' with the city of San
Francisco offering domestic partner benefits to city employees. But
he said it was ``a tremendous stretch'' for the city to try to
force private businesses to offer domestic partner benefits, which
usually take the form of medical insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco board of supervisors adopted the domestic
partners ordinance, effective June 1, 1997, requiring city
contractors to provide the same benefits to the domestic partners _
gay and straight _ of their employees as they would to married
couples.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights advocates hailed the measure as an important step
toward equality.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Salvation Army refused to go along with the rule
and announced that it would no longer accept city funds to pay for
its programs serving the homeless, drug addicts and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Salvation Army objects to the domestic partners law on
religious grounds,'' the charity group said, adding that it has
always provided services without discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In disclosing his plan, Riggs cited the Salvation Army's
decision and complained that the effect of the San Francisco
ordinance ``is to deny taxpayer-funded assistance to the most
needy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really doing it to try to get the board of supervisors to
reconsider this ill-advised policy in light of the unintended
effects _ such as the Salvation Army that wouldn't knuckle-under to
this particular ordinance. I just can't believe they would punish
the Salvation Army and the people it serves.''
</P>
<P>
   Riggs said he hopes the city would grant a waiver to the
Salvation Army so it can continue to provide beds for the homeless
and meals for AIDs patients without losing federal dollars.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Mayor Willi Brown reacted angrily to Riggs' plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're outraged at this type of activity,'' said Brown. ``Local
autonomy is of utmost importance and Congressman Riggs has in the
past been a supporter of that concept. It's the oldest trick in the
book to attach non-relevant amendments to a bill. We hope the
(Clinton) administration and Congress will find a way to eliminate
this amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   The leading gay and lesbian organization also expressed outrage
at Riggs's plan.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Winnie Stachelberg, political director for the
Human Rights Campaign, said Riggs' plan ``was an anti-gay attack,
pure and simple, but what is so frightening about it is it
jeopardizes the welfare of tens of thousands of men, women and
children in San Francisco in order to punish a locality for setting
a policy that's clearly within its jurisdiction.... This is an
example of gross federal micromanagement of local issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Her organization issued a statement labeling the Riggs plan as a
``direct attack on the city of San Francisco.'' The statement said
the Riggs amendment ``makes a mockery'' of Republican rhetoric
about empowering local governments to handle their own affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., whose district includes San
Francisco, attacked Riggs' planned amendment as ``irresponsible and
draconian'' and said it ``would undermine local autonomy and put
the federal government in the role of dictating policy to cities
around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The two San Francisco supervisors at the forefront of the
domestic partners law criticized Riggs' efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's blackmail and political opportunism,'' said Supervisor
Tom Ammiano. ``This is an issue of local sovereignty. There's a
mandate from the electorate for domestic partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Said San Francisco Supervisor Leslie Katz: ``This is much bigger
than the City of San Francisco. This is a fundamental issue about
local autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano added that San Francisco's law ``has been a tremendous
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the ground-breaking law took effect 13 months ago, more
than 1,700 companies have extended equal benefits to their workers'
domestic partners, according to city officials.

   If enacted, Riggs' amendment to the $25 billion HUD budget would
potentially affect 20 federal programs in San Francisco. Among them
are the construction of new public housing and the demolition of
old, dysfunctional units; the community development block grant
program for revitalizing downtown areas; empowerment zones and
enterprise communities, where businesses receive tax incentives and
grants to develop commercial enterprises in blighted areas; and
housing projects for senior citizens and the disabled.

<P>
   In one of several court challenges to the city ordinance, a
federal judge ruled in April that the ordinance was constitutional
as long as it was limited to employees of the contractor who live
within the boundaries of the city of San Francisco. Thus, a
national company that has an office in San Francisco and has a
contract with the city would have to offer domestic-partner
benefits to those employees who work in the city. The company would
not have to provide domestic partner benefits to all employees
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Other court challenges are pending, including one brought by the
American Center for Law and Justice, a conservative organization
affiliated with fundamentalist minister Pat Robertson.

   The Riggs amendment is the latest in a series of assaults on
homosexuals by congressional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colo., said in an interview Wednesday that
he plans next week to offer legislation that would nullify
President Clinton's executive order banning job discrimination
against homosexuals working for the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey, R-Texas, recently cited
scripture for his view that homosexuality is a sin, an assertion
that came just days after Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., compared homosexuals to alcoholics, kleptomaniacs and sex
addicts.

MEEHAN SAYS TIME RUNNING OUT ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND ESTELLA DURAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With time running out on a congressional effort to
overhaul the campaign-finance system, Representative Martin T.
Meehan said Thursday the initiative will fail unless House
Republican leaders agree in writing to complete action before the
summer recess begins Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat and co-sponsor of the most
prominent plan to rewrite the campaign-finance laws, issued the
warning as negotiators remained deadlocked on a prospective
agreement to conclude the protracted debate.
</P>
<P>
   In a breakfast meeting with reporters, Meehan said ``any
reasonable person'' would recognize the problem. Only 16
legislative days remain before Aug. 7, the last day the House could
act on the campaign-finance issue and leave enough time for the
Senate to consider the legislation before Congress adjourns in
early October.
</P>
<P>
   Under a rare procedure approved by Speaker Newt Gingrich, the
House must consider a freshmen-sponsored campaign-finance proposal,
11 susbtitute plans and 258 amendments before it completes action
on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way we could get this done, if you look at the
schedule,'' Meehan said. ``What we need to do is come to an
agreement on limiting debate, limiting amendments, limiting
substitutes, and limiting time, then have a vote.''
</P>
<P>
   House leaders have permitted only several hours of debate on the
issue each week for more than a month. And only a few hours of
debate are scheduled next week.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave 10 day legislative days to complete the debate,
as well as consider other vital legislation, including eight
spending bills to keep the government operating.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan, who has pushed for several years for new
campaign-finance laws with his Republican co-sponsor,
Representative Christopher Shays, of Connecticut, lashed out at GOP
leaders for creating a debate procedure that he said could allow
opponents ``to filibuster the bill to death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to come back week after week and work on this
and to not get cynical about the motives of the Republican
leadership,'' he said. ``I feel as though we've been a little too
patient with the Republican leadership on this.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief Republican negotiator on campaign finance, California
Representative Bill Thomas, did not return phone calls seeking
comment.

 &HT;    PARTY LINES DRAWN OVER PATIENTS BILL OF RIGHTS
 &HT;    750&AMP;add
 &HT;    Photos to illustrate this story are available from The New York
Times News Service.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN and REBECCA CARR
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican and Democratic leaders, scrambling to
control a potent election-year issue, urged passage Thursday of
competing health-care bills that would stiffen regulation of the
managed care industry and provide more rights for patients.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare appearance on Capitol Hill, President Clinton joined
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle and House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt at a rally touting the Democratic plan, which would impose
federal regulations on managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have comprehensive national legislation,'' Clinton
said. ``That's one of the biggest problems with the bill offered by
the Republican leadership, it covers too few people.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, Speaker Newt Gingrich and Republican House
leaders unveiled their plan. It would give patients better access
to doctors of their choice; create an external appeals process for
managed care decisions, and provide direct access to gynecologists
for women and pediatricians for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about human beings,'' Gingrich said against the
backdrop of the George Washington Medical Center, where where
President Reagan was taken after an assassination attempt in 1981.
``No human being in need of legitimate care should be stopped from
getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Senate Republicans outlined their own version of a
patient protection bill, which would be limited only to persons in
employer-sponsored health care plans.
</P>
<P>
   Riding what polls show is a large reservoir of anger at HMOs for
denying medical treatment _ and bolstered by horror stories of
delayed treatment leading to permanent injury and death _ both
parties are trying to position themselves as the defenders of
patient rights. Next week, both houses of Congress are expected to
take up the respective GOP bills.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican bills differ sharply, particularly over the
issue of whether patients should have the right to sue a managed
care plan if its delay or denial of treatment injured a patient. A
1974 law exempts employer-sponsored health plans _ and the managed
care companies that administer them _ from being held liable for
medical malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Democratic congressional leaders said Thursday they
were willing to compromise on many provisions of a patients
protection bill, but would insist on the right to sue for damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can write all the guarantees you want into the law here in
Washington, (but) if nobody can enforce them, the delay in the
system will still cause people to die,'' Clinton said. ``We have to
do something about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle took an even harder line: ``There's something wrong in
this country when the only groups of people who get immunity from
our laws are foreign diplomats and HMO bureaucrats. It's time for
HMOs to understand: when their decisions cause the death or injury
of a patient, they will be held responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton and Gingrich both said patient protection
should not be a partisan issue, congressional leaders of both
parties were harshly critical of the other's bills.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle called the Republican bill ``a response to the polls.
Our bill is a response to the patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan is ``the only true patient protection''
bill, responded Rep. James Talent, R-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Republican unity cracked slightly when Rep. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa,
a plastic reconstructive surgeon, joined Clinton and Democratic
leaders to support the Patients Bill of Rights measure introduced
by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Ganske displayed a large color photograph of a young boy born
with a severely cleft palate and noted that an HMO had initially
denied coverage for his reconstructive surgery because it was
considered cosmetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``For heaven's sake, insurance should mean something,'' Ganske
said. ``People who pay good money for their HMO should not have to
rely on charity so their child can have a normal face like this
little boy had after his surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   After being criticized by some Republicans for his decision to
participate in the rally with Clinton and the Democrats, Ganske
announced Thursday that he was resigning as a GOP member of the
Medicare Reform Commission. He said Gingrich had not asked for the
resignation, but other GOP members had questioned his service on
the high-profile commission.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was joined by leaders of the American Medical
Association and the American Nurses Association in calling for a
comprehensive national patients Bill of Rights. Democratic leaders
said more than 170 health care and consumer organizations have
endorsed their bill.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Health Benefits Coalition, representing the
nation's major business organizations, announced it planned a major
grassroots and advertising campaign to defeat the proposal. The
group warned that the Democratic plan would expose employers who
provide health coverage ``to unlimited lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   The managed care industry bristled at the attacks from both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real people being attacked are those working Americans who
are going to pay more for their health care or have their health
care coverage dropped because the increased costs that these laws
would impose,'' said Mark Merritt, vice president of American
Association of Health Plans, which represents more than 1,000
managed care companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians are playing a bait-and-switch game. They are
playing this as an attack on health plans when all this is is a
hidden tax masquerading as consumer protections.''
</P>
<P>
   Major legislative initiatives have died in Congress recently as
a result of bitter partisan feuding. The massive tobacco bill
disintegrated, as did a proposal to overhaul campaign fund-raising
laws.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to avoid that, Gingrich said he would seek support
from the White House and from Democrats to pass a bipartisan bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big test ought to be: can we get together and pass a
bill,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered similar sentiments: ``We need to do everything
we can to stop this from being a partisan political issue, because
it isn't anywhere but Washington. It's a people issue.''

TEXAS BUDGET SURPLUS LIKELY TO HIT $3.7 BILLION AT YEAR'S END 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   With sales tax revenues booming, Texas' budget surplus probably
will reach a record $3.7 billion when legislators start work in
January on how to use it, state Comptroller John Sharp said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a turnaround that has not been achieved by any other
state,'' Sharp said, recalling that Texas faced a deficit of at
least $4.5 billion in 1991 as the economy recovered from an oil
industry collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp, speaking to the Rotary Club of Houston as the Democratic
candidate for lieutenant governor, joked that Texas might consider
buying New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Unless problems related to the troubled Asian economy, the Texas
agricultural drought or other factors interfere, the surplus will
continue to grow to $6.7 billion for the two-year budget that
starts in September 1999, Sharp said.
</P>
<P>
   The state's current two-year budget is about $84 billion, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   With statewide offices up for the grabs in the November election
and lawmakers pushing for tax cuts or new programs, Sharp's
announcement created a wave of comments about the pot of gold.
</P>
<P>
   No leader proposed refunding the entire amount to the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. George W. Bush said he will first push for
funding of top-priority programs, especially public education, and
then look for ``responsible ways'' to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to make sure that tax cuts and spending
commitments during a time of economic prosperity will not create a
burden for the state when economic times are not as good,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   With last year's Legislature, Bush engineered property tax cuts
totaling about $1 billion. But lawmakers rejected his proposals for
more massive tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   State House Speaker Pete Laney echoed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``When times are good, we should lay the groundwork to prepare
for lean times,'' Laney said about Sharp's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's look for the long term,'' said House Appropriations
Committee Chairman Rob Junell, D-San Angelo, as he cautioned
against hasty tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Texas could continue granting property tax cuts, Junell said,
but ``how do you refund people's sales tax? We don't keep records
on who spent it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp's preliminary surplus estimate came at the request of
Junell, who wanted to give budget planners an early picture of the
state's books.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Sharp pegged the surplus at about $1 billion, based
on the forecast that personal income in Texas would grow as much as
6.4 percent this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   The new forecast assumes 7.5 percent growth this year.
</P>
<P>
   State sales tax revenues are climbing 10 percent a year, a rate
unseen since the oil-related boom of the late 1970s, Sharp said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, which has no personal income tax, collects a tax of 6.25
cents on every $1 of sales with exemptions for food, medicine and
other items.
</P>
<P>
   Business taxes, motor vehicle taxes and other fees are
contributing to the surplus, Sharp said, along with cost-saving
moves put into place by elected officials from both parties since
1991.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He cited his own agency's development of the Lone Star card, an
electronic debit system that is credited with reducing food stamp
fraud, as an example.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic gubernatorial candidate Garry Mauro, the state land
commissioner, said the surplus estimate deflects Bush's criticisms
of his proposals, which include giving teachers a $5,000 pay raise,
replacing temporary classroom buildings and junking the tax on
vehicle purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``This budget surplus gives us the historic opportunity to put
`Texas families first,' '' he said, referring to the title of his
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp said the state could cut taxes in ways that would
encourage business development, such as exempting small business
from franchise fees and giving tax credits for research and
development by large firms. The state could also consider funding
college tuition for the best students and carrying a larger share
of the funding for public schools, giving relief to property
taxpayers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp's Republican opponent for lieutenant governor, state
Agriculture Commissioner Rick Perry, said the state should fund
priority programs, such as a crime-fighting programs, and use the
remainder of the surplus for tax cuts.

RUSSIAN PRESIDENT, IN CHANGE OF HEART, WILL ATTEND CZAR'S BURIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ It is difficult to upstage the burial
of the final czar, emperor and autocrat of all the Russias, the man
whose remains were hidden for nearly eight decades by the
communists who killed him and seized his empire. But President
Boris Yeltsin managed to do just that on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In trademark fashion, Yeltsin abruptly announced on television
that he had decided to attend Friday's elaborate and much-debated
interment of Czar Nicholas II, most of his family and four servants
in the czar's imposing riverside fortress here. ``This truth has
been concealed for 80 years,'' he said, referring to the killings,
``and we have to tell this truth tomorrow and I should take part.
This will be the right thing to do from the human point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   That caused a small sensation. Yeltsin had said only weeks
earlier that he would not go to the funeral, apparently because the
country's political and religious factions are deeply split over
its meaning and propriety. That announcement, in turn, had caused a
stir, because it was Yeltsin who had virtually ordered a state
funeral for the czar in the first place, as an act of national
repentance.
</P>
<P>
   His spokesman said on Thursday that Yeltsin's turnabout came
after ``hard thinking'' and a talk with Dmitry Likhachyov, a
historian and major figure in Russian cultural affairs. Almost but
not quite lost amid the pirouettes was Nicholas himself, returning
to his ancestral home for the first time since he abdicated the
throne in March 1917. The fragmentary remains of the czar, his wife
Alexandra, three of his four daughters and four servants were
unloaded from a cargo plane at the St. Petersburg airport Thursday
to the accompaniment of an army band's dirge and an honor guard's
salute.
</P>
<P>
   Each small wooden coffin, embellished with a cross, silk tassels
and an engraved nameplate, was then loaded into its own teal
minivan and escorted through the city to the hexagonal riverside
fortress, built by Nicholas' ancestor Peter the Great some 350
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from an occasional communist flag, there was neither much
protest or approval along the long route until the motorcade neared
the fortress itself. There, thousands watched the procession of
funeral vans as the Russian tricolor and the red-and-yellow flag of
St. Petersburg flapped at half-mast under a bright sun and stiff
wind.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as bells rang, snare drums kept march time and a Scottish
bagpiper wheezed mournfully, _ the czar was related to Queen
Victoria and was honorary commander of a company of Scottish
dragoons _ the coffins were brought into the fortress and carried
to a cathedral where services will be held. At noon on Friday, the
remains will be eulogized and lowered into a single crypt in the
cathedral, which already serves as a mausoleum for the Romanov
dynasty that ruled Russia from the 1600s until Nicholas' death.
</P>
<P>
   Four hundred government officials, diplomats, Romanov
descendants and others will witness Friday's service, but until
Thursday, the guest list included few of the political or religious
elite. After Yeltsin changed his mind, the leaders of the Russian
parliament's upper house, the Federation Council, said they would
also send an official delegation. But the lower house, the Duma, is
ignoring the event, and church leaders also are staying away.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The execution of the Romanovs was, until recently, both one of
the pivots and enigmas of 20th-century history. It was long known
that the imperial family and their servants were executed by
Bolshevik revolutionaries in 1918. But the details of the deaths
and the location of the bodies were carefully hidden secrets until
close to the end of communist rule in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Leading historians now say most victims were hastily buried in a
pit and then covered with logs. Two bodies _ those of the czar's
only son, and one daughter _ have never been found. Many experts
believe they were partly burned and buried nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin ordered the bodies recovered and authenticated in 1991
after their discovery became public, and DNA tests in U.S. and
European laboratories later concluded that the remains almost
certainly are those of the czar's family. But just as many Russian
leaders have contested or ignored much of that story _ especially
the still-powerful Communist Party, whose leaders ordered the
executions, and the Russian Orthodox Church, which is split over
the authenticity of the remains. And the Russian public, ever
suspicious of official pronouncements, is almost evenly split over
whether the coffins actually contain royal bones, according to one
new public-opinion poll.
</P>
<P>
   The mercurial Yeltsin is prone to schedule and cancel
appearances almost as often as he fires and hires cabinets, a trait
_ or tactic _ that has served to keep him at the center of public
attention. His spokesman, who said on Monday that rumors of
Yeltsin's attendance at the funeral were ``nonsense,'' said
Thursday that the president's latest change of heart was ``a
courageous, humane and Christian act'' devoid of political meaning.
His political allies and foes immediately began reading import into
it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Chernomyrdin, once Yeltsin's prime minister and now a
candidate for his job as president, called the funeral ``a mess.''
``We shouldn't turn it into a show, trying to clear out who will
attend and will not attend the ceremony,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gennady Zyganov, the Duma's communist leader, said Yeltsin
clearly was acting under political pressure from his advisers.
Yeltsin's spokesman called that ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the cathedral, a stooped and white-haired Russian woman
in formal dress said her father had commanded forces in the
so-called White Army that fought a failed counterrevolutionary
battle against the communists in 1918. ``Praise God,'' she said of
the funeral. ``It's about time.''

 &HT;    KEY HOUSE CHAIRMAN DIGS IN ON VISAS FOR FOREIGN WORKERS
 &HT;    With TECH-VISAS-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    By CHRISTI HARLAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ High-tech companies and other employers who are
waiting for more visas to hire foreign workers may have to wait a
little longer.
</P>
<P>
   This year's supply of 65,000 visas for specially skilled foreign
workers ran out more than two months ago, but legislation that
would create more visas remains stalled in the House, the victim of
an increasingly entrenched battle over protections for U.S. tech
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has already voted, 78-20, to create more of the H-1B
visas without imposing new requirements on employers. Unless an
agreement can be reached on the House version, no more visas for
foreign workers will be available until Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the House bill's chief sponsor, Rep. Lamar Smith,
R-Texas, again defied business groups and his own party leadership
by insisting that any new H-1B visas be accompanied by requirements
that employers certify that they made efforts to find U.S. workers
for jobs being filled by foreign workers. Smith also wants
employers to certify that no U.S. workers were laid off from those
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration chimed in Thursday with its most
serious threat to date that President Clinton may veto any visa
legislation that does not include the worker protections being
sought by Smith. The administration is also insisting that U.S.
employers help pay for training of U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   The tough stands may complicate work next week for Republican
congressional leaders, who plan to bring in their top guns to try
to resolve the impasse. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., are expected to join the
small group of House and Senate members who have been trying for
weeks to hash out an agreement on the visas.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, has been
the highest-ranking Republican in the group, which has included
Smith and the author of the Senate bill, Sen. Spencer Abraham,
R-Mich. Smith's fellow Texan and Republican, Sen. Phil Gramm, has
also been in on the efforts to persuade Smith to lighten his
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, Smith wasn't budging: ``The most simple, most
basic protection we can give American workers is to guarantee that
they won't be fired by their employers and replaced by foreign
workers on H-1B visas,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared at a news conference with computer specialist Ed
Curry of Jarrell, Texas, and two other U.S. workers who said they
have been unable to find the computer jobs they are seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lives have essentially been run through a wringer,'' said
Curry, who shuttered his computer-chip analyzing business in early
1997. Curry has been through a series of short-term consulting jobs
since then, some at firms that employ foreign workers on H-1B
visas. None of the companies have offered him fulltime work. ``I'm
not able to find employment even with basic benefits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech companies, who complain of a shortage of suitable
workers, are leading the fight to defeat additional requirements
for hiring foreign workers. In a letter last week to Smith, Gramm
and other members of the group, several company executives, said
the requirements ``give the Labor Department enormous new powers
over how American companies run their personnel policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey said Thursday that he is optimistic that a compromise can
be reached: ``I think we're just about an inch away from closing
this up,'' he said a few hours before the White House released a
statement saying that Clinton's top advisers would recommend a veto
of any bill that did not contain additional protection for U.S.
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it may be necessary in the short term to increase the
number of visas for temporary foreign workers, this must only be
done in conjunction with additional efforts to increase the skill
level of U.S. workers and meaningful reforms to the H-1B program,''
the White House said in the statement.

VICTIMS (Washington) - The nation's most high-profile spokesmen for

funding to another state where that criminal commits the next
crime. But critics say the bill is likely unconstitutional

PIGEONS (Lake Havasu City, Ariz.) - The smell used to be so bad

DESPITE NEWSPAPER'S APOLOGY, CHIQUITA STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (With sidebar, CHIQUITA-MEDIA) 
(nk) 
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Overlooked in the furor that followed when The
Cincinnati Enquirer last month apologized for a stinging series
accusing Chiquita Brands International of engaging in corruption
were the extraordinary allegations at the heart of the series _ the
questionable business practices of a major corporation with broad
influence in the United States and across Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   In their first lengthy interviews on the subject, top Chiquita
executives claimed total victory and portrayed the entire package
of articles as unfair and inaccurate, the untrustworthy work of a
reporter who stole hundreds of voice-mail messages. But interviews
with government officials, people outside the company, and some of
those quoted, along with a review of the articles, found that some
of the allegations cannot be dismissed so easily, despite the
questions raised about the methods used to report them.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission had already initiated an
inquiry into Chiquita's practices on the basis of some of the
stolen taped voice-mail messages, and the government of Honduras,
where Chiquita has been a power for decades, said it was reviewing
some of the charges raised by the series, ranging from bribery of
foreign officials to the use of dangerous pesticides at some of the
company's foreign agricultural sites.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita could face penalties under the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act if it engaged in or failed to disclose bribery. A
lawyer briefed on the commission's inquiries to the company said
the investigation was not slowed by the disclosure that the voice
mail was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just draw your attention to the fact that the information
that was reported was extremely detailed,'' said the lawyer, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``This isn't going away.''
</P>
<P>
   Determining the validity of the newspaper's claims is difficult.
The publisher and editor of the newspaper, which paid more than $10
million to Chiquita, refused to discuss the articles or provide
access to the voice-mail messages and Chiquita records, citing a
confidentiality agreement with Chiquita. Mike Gallagher, the
reporter who wrote the articles, did not respond to messages left
at his home, and his attorney, Patrick Hangley, did not return
telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   However, no one has disputed the authenticity of the voice mail
and internal Chiquita records that formed the basis for the most
sensational allegations, and the Chiquita executives said they
could not respond to some questions raised by the articles.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita has a storied and infamous past. Its predecessor
company, United Fruit, was so influential in Latin America, where
most bananas are grown, that it inspired the term ``banana
republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl H. Linder Jr., a prominent Cincinnati financier and major
donor to the Republicans and Democrats, acquired a majority
interest in Chiquita in 1984 through his American Financial Corp.
Four years later, he moved Chiquita to Cincinnati from New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Chiquita has worked to shake off its old
notoriety and present itself as a socially and environmentally
conscious company. But trade restrictions and new competitors have
made selling bananas a tough business, and company executives
acknowledged that they can make improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have work to do,'' said Steven Warshaw, Chiquita
president and chief operating officer. ``The company is making a
tremendous effort to do things right, but that doesn't happen
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Enquirer offered a sharp rebuttal to the new image in an
18-page special section published May 3, called ``Chiquita Secrets
Revealed.'' The articles claimed the company secretly controlled
dozens of supposedly independent banana companies to avoid
restrictions on land ownership and limit unions, threatened the
health of its workers through indiscriminate use of pesticides and
was involved in a bribery scheme and a host of other questionable
practices.
</P>
<P>
   But on June 28, The Enquirer, owned by the Gannett Co.,
published its apology to Chiquita. The paper said Gallagher had
claimed to have obtained copies of the voice-mail messages from a
high-ranking Chiquita official. ``The Enquirer has now become
convinced that the above representations, accusations and
conclusions are untrue and created a false and misleading
impression of Chiquita's business practices,'' read the apology.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Olson, Chiquita's general counsel, said the company had
prepared a suit against The Enquirer and that the paper avoided it
only at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Enquirer publisher, Harry Whipple, and editor, Lawrence
Beaupre, declined to answer any questions about the accuracy and
fairness of the stories or the circumstances surrounding the
apology. Whipple said they were bound by a confidentiality
agreement with Chiquita.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chiquita executives, Warshaw and Olson, provided a
rebuttal to some of the allegations in a two-hour interview,
several follow-up conversations and written material. They
declined, however, to answer questions on some key points, citing
the Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry and an ongoing
criminal investigation into the theft of the voice-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   The executives did not dispute the authenticity of the voice
mail or internal documents. However, they said the paper's articles
took brief portions out of context and provided an unfair and
inaccurate portrait of Chiquita.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that voice-mail messages are often thoughts in
process or, in my vernacular, blah, blah, blah,'' said Warshaw,
whose own voice mail was invaded. ``They represent conjecture and
cannot be understood out of context.''
</P>
<P>
   But the articles were based on more than voice-mail messages.
Indeed, the article charging that the company used foreign trusts
to evade restrictions on land ownership in Honduras, a major
growing location, relied on Chiquita documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using more than one bank in Honduras and more than one country
to establish offshore trusts further obfuscates the ownership of
the farms,'' said a 1991 letter from a Chiquita finance executive
to a company vice president, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
   A voice-mail message played a key role in describing what the
newspaper said was the company's secret ownership of a farm
management company in Guatemala called COBIGUA. After Enquirer
reporters questioned company lawyers about rumors concerning
Chiquita ownership of COBIGUA last October, David Hills, a Chiquita
lawyer, left a message for one of his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is to answer that, first of all, that COBIGUA is
not our subsidiary, it's just one of our (independent) associate
producers _ wink, wink _ because we have to take that position
publicly,'' said Hills, according to the article. ``We cannot
possibly admit that COBIGUA is our subsidiary.''
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw said he could not respond directly to questions about
the trusts and relations with banana producers for competitive
reasons. ``My blanket statement is that we operate an international
business in a manner that we and others consider to be ethical,''
he said. ``We are highly confident that any arrangements that have
been put into place are conforming.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the articles ran, The Enquirer provided information about
the trust arrangements to the Honduran embassy in Washington, D.C.
An embassy official, Benjamin Zapata, was quoted saying the
government would review the matter.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Honduran ambassador to the United States, Edgardo
Dumas Rodriguez, said in an interview Wednesday that there would be
no inquiry. ``Do you believe that the government of Honduras should
trust someone who did what this reporter did?'' asked the
ambassador. ``We have no reasonable reason to believe Chiquita did
these things.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Honduras, where Chiquita has been a powerful political force
for nearly a century, the controversy has had surprisingly little
impact. The Enquirer's initial stories were widely reproduced, but
merely reinforced the low regard in which many Hondurans
traditionally have held the company, journalists and diplomats
said. The newspaper's apology and $10 million payment was
overshadowed by other news.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell the truth, not that many people have been paying
attention, because the flap occurred right in the middle of the
World Cup, and most people were more interested in soccer,'' said
Juan Bautista Vazquez, a veteran radio reporter in Tegucigalpa, the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the company said the memos and voice mail
messages provided dramatic confirmation of long-held suspicions
about Chiquita's operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the sudden the voice mail and documents confirmed all
the things we have believed passionately,'' said Larry Birns, an
official at the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a liberal research
organization in Washington. ``Chiquita got the luckiest break in
the world when the messages turned out to be stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   Birns said he provided Gallagher documents from the council's
files and the reporter allowed him to record some voice mail
messages. Last month, he said, an FBI agent came to his office and
asked for copies of any Chiquita tapes in his possession.
</P>
<P>
   The articles also claimed that Chiquita's use of pesticides
endangers workers and residents near its farms, despite an
agreement with an independent environmental group to follow strict
standards. In addition to voice mail messages and internal
documents, those articles relied on many interviews in Central
America and additional records, including a coroner's report on the
death of one worker from exposure to toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw disputed the claims, saying the company is a model in
its attempts to reduce the use of pesticides and that government
agencies in Central America have approved its practices.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita executives said they were particularly angered that the
newspaper implied that toxic pesticides were sprayed on workers
from airplanes. They said the company does not engage in aerial
spraying of pesticides, although it does so with herbicides, which
are far less dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most controversial articles claimed Chiquita tried to
cover up a bribery scheme in Colombia that implicated employees of
a chemical company and its subsidiaries. The article, which relied
heavily on voice mail messages, described apparent payments to
customs agents for use of a storage facility. In one message to
Warshaw and Olson, a Chiquita lawyer discussed how to fire one of
the employees without implicating the company.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately three employees, including an executive in Cincinnati
and one in Colombia, were forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita also offered defenses from third parties in the
interview, including a recent United Nations report that singled
out one of Chiquita's banana farms for its efforts to reduce
pollution and copies of letters to The Enquirer objecting to
portions of the articles.
</P>
<P>
   Olson said the article had many facts wrong, but he refused to
discuss specifics because of the Securities and Exchange Commission
investigation. ``Management covered all the right bases on this and
behaved properly,'' said Olson.

IN SHIFT, CHINA ANNOUNCES CRACKDOWN ON SMUGGLING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 1st graf and penultimate graf to change day to Thursday)  (bl) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ After years of tolerating a steady growth of
lawlessness at their borders, China's leaders Thursday announced a
war on smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharp indictment of how corrupt and ineffectual Chinese
Customs officials have become, the leaders announced that a new
anti-smuggling police force would be formed. President Jiang Zemin,
addressing a special meeting of top leaders, outlined the problem
in a way that showed how border guards have simply become unwilling
or unable to perform their job.
</P>
<P>
   A major reason the smuggling situation has become so desperate,
Jiang pointed out, is that many of the worst offenders are party
officials and army officers. It was the first time that a top
Chinese official had publicly referred to the extensive role that
China's military plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is confronted by rampant smuggling that involves the
participation of some party, government and army organizations, as
well as judicial and law enforcement departments,'' Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the volume of goods smuggled into China cannot be
measured, officials and business executives estimate that it has
reached tens of billions of dollars a year. The main contraband is
not drugs or arms but rather consumer goods that face such onerous
import duties that it pays to bribe Customs officers or to pay off
army transport officers, who can escape scrutiny at the border.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarettes, gold and automobiles were among the heavily smuggled
items cited at the meeting. Yet a wide range of industrial and
consumer items like telecommunications equipment, diesel oil and
chemicals are also smuggled in enormous quantities.
</P>
<P>
   Even cigarettes produced in China are a major item. To avoid
domestic taxes, many cigarette makers export more than half their
output, only to smuggle the cigarettes back into China, thus
avoiding both domestic and import duties.
</P>
<P>
   With smuggling so rampant and so deeply entrenched in the
interests of powerful authorities, it is not clear how effective
Beijing's new campaign will be. The size and scope of the new
police force is vague; no director was named.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the first five months of this year, Chinese Customs
confiscated $350 million of smuggled goods, a small fraction of the
overall volume. In an report this week, Customs officers blamed
local officials who often blocked investigations.
</P>
<P>
   As with any national campaign, there may be several political
elements at work. Yet decision-making in China remains so opaque
that it is impossible to know if the driving force is Jiang's
desire to flex his muscles over the military or buttress his
reputation as a corruption-fighter.
</P>
<P>
   There may also be financial concerns. Prime Minister Zhu Rongji
argued that it was necessary to reverse the drastic drop in tax
collection as the government undertakes a huge spending program to
encourage economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carrying out the anti-smuggling struggle throughout the whole
country with the speed of lightning is related to achieving this
year's economic growth target,'' Zhu told the meeting.
``Increasingly rampant smuggling activities have already caused
serious harm to many aspects of China's economy, society and
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhu said all party and government offices and law enforcement
agencies would be required to sever ties with affiliated business
companies in an effort to root out official protection of
smuggling. Yet in China's complex morass of companies that are
owned and partly owned by the government, that will be a gargantuan
task.
</P>
<P>
   Fines and proceeds from confiscated goods, Zhu said, will be
divided in a formula: 50 percent to equip anti-smuggling police and
reward individuals and departments that help, 20 percent to pay for
anti-smuggling efforts by provincial governments and 30 percent for
the central government.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, a People's Daily account of the meeting noted the
attendance of leaders of the Xinjiang Production and Construction
Military Group, the only organization to be named. Xinjiang, a vast
area in the northwest that borders Russia and Kazahkstan, is a
center for smuggling, and mentioning the paramilitary group
suggested that it has been playing a role in smuggling itself.
</P>
<P>
   Diesel oil has been flowing into China from refineries in other
parts of Asia even though a ban on imports took effect in February.
Smuggled oil is much cheaper than domestically produced oil, whose
price is set artificially high by the government, and illegal sales
have severely hurt domestic refineries.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial in Thursday's issue of People's Daily said
smuggling eroded tax revenues, violated import-export management
policies corrupted officials and undermined social morals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general public must fully realize that the anti-smuggling
drive is not only a major economic struggle, but also a harsh
political struggle that will have a great bearing on the reform,
opening-up and modernization drive,'' the editorial said.

SURE `BETTE': CLASSIC DELIVERS WICKED FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Revenge is sweet and equally amusing in ``Cousin
Bette,'' a wickedly droll comedy about the endless vanity of the
upper classes.
</P>
<P>
   With a dry wit and a touch of cruel delight in exposing the
foibles of the elite, director Des McAnuff turns Honore de Balzac's
classic novel into the most amusing literary romp since Gwyneth
Paltrow's sassy ``Emma.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in Paris in the middle of the 19th century, ``Cousin Bette''
details the decline of the Hulot family, led to the brink of ruin
by the profligate baron (Hugh Laurie).
</P>
<P>
   Bette (Jessica Lange) is the poor country cousin of the snobbish
family, an old maid whose strength of character and force of will
go unrecognized in a society where women get by on youth and
beauty, men on wealth and arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   Having served the baron's family faithfully for years, Bette is
wronged by the family and determines to have her revenge, to bring
its members as low as they have sunk her.
</P>
<P>
   Her scheme is simplicity itself: The family is so foolish that
all Bette needs to do is facilitate its follies and the family will
bring itself down.
</P>
<P>
   She is aided in this endeavor by the demimonde's favorite singer
(Elisabeth Shue), who is the heartthrob of Paris and the mistress
of a series of men whose money has overcome their better judgment,
if they ever had any.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bette's plans are complicated when she falls in love
with a starving young artist (Aden Young) and finds her own foolish
heart getting in the way of revenge.
</P>
<P>
   McAnuff turns Balzac's tale of social unravelings into an
intellectual nose thumbing that, in the end, insults us as happily
as it insults the 19th-century French.
</P>
<P>
   McAnuff has a sly eye for designing scenes that emphasize the
humor in any situation, as everyone takes a turn being the butt of
the joke. He pushes ``Cousin Bette'' to the edge of farce several
times, but restrains that urge in favor of drollery.
</P>
<P>
   Making his first film, McAnuff directs with the skill and
confidence of a veteran.
</P>
<P>
   He is an accomplished playwright and theater director, but other
directors have come from the stage without his talent for
enlivening screen dramatics.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of miserable outings in ``Hush'' and ``A Thousand
Acres,'' Lange finds a starring role perfectly fitted to her manic
intensity. She plays Bette like a coiled asp waiting, waiting,
waiting to strike.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie (who plays the rich fool in ``Jeeves and Wooster'')
creates a perfect fool as the baron, for he is made poignant by his
ability to see how foolish he is while he is unable to do anything
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cousin Bette'' is an enjoyably poisonous comedy, the perfect
antidote for a summer of too much slapstick and not enough
sophisticated humor.
</P>
<P>
   Rated R for nudity, sex and profanity, ``Cousin Bette'' is more
risque than ``Masterpiece Theater'' has led us to expect from our
literary classics. 4 stars. &QL;

POLAROID REPORTS 22 PERCENT DECLINE IN REVENUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Polaroid Corp., which last month warned investors to expect
disappointing second quarter financial results, delivered as
promised: a dramatic drop in profits and a 22 percent decline in
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced that most of its top two dozen
executives have agreed to invest more than $2.5 million of their
own money in the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge, Mass. company reported earnings of $12.1 million,
or 27 cents a share, excluding one-time gains and loss reserves.
That compares with a $34.6 million profit, or 76 cents a share, for
the same period last year. Polaroid's revenues, which were hurt by
lower camera and film purchases by Kmart Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores
Inc., fell to $464.7 million for the quarter from $564.9 million in
the comparable period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid had said last month that its results would be hurt a
new strategy among retailers to keep inventories lean.
</P>
<P>
   The changing inventory patterns at retailers was only part of
Polaroid's quarterly downturn . Consumer camera and film purchases
also fell, although the company declined to state how much it
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid also said it created a $10 million pre-tax reserve to
cover potential bad debts in Russia. The instant photography
company added that it took a $26.3 million pre-tax gain on the sale
of some of its closed plants and other real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the company's forecast last month, Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter analyst, Rebecca Runkle said she was surprised by the some
of financial results, including lower-than-expected international
revenues and generally higher selling and administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid's shares, which have fallen 37 percent in the past 12
months, closed Thursday unchanged at 35 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   The lackluster stock performance and Polaroid's anemic earnings
have put pressure on chairman and chief executive Gary DiCamillo,
now in his third year at the company. Having pared costs with
layoffs, plant closings and fewer long-term research and
development projects, DiCamillo has said he is now looking for
growth with forthcoming new products.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to tie executives closer to the company's future
performance, DiCamillo announced that most of the two dozen top
officers have agreed to use their own money to buy $2.5 million of
Polaroid stock. The company is scrapping top managers' existing
stock-ownership plan, based on a corporate officer's annual
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that our officers should have a significant portion
of their net worth tied directly to the company's performance,''
said DiCamillo about the new voluntary program.
</P>
<P>
   These officials, he added, ``are sending a clear, unambiguous
message that Polaroid officers are committed to and believe in our
strategic plan to grow Polaroid's sales and earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman said the executives won't receive any
interest-free corporate loans to buy the stock.
</P>
<P>
   A major question mark will be whether new products _ such as a
single use disposable instant camera due out this fall _ will be
popular enough to lift the company's sales and profits.
</P>

U.S. URGED TO BUY OUT HOMES IN FLOOD-PRONE AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(subs 1st graf to fix day) 
 (ATTN: La., Texas, Mo., N.J., N.Y., Fla., Mass., Miss., Calif.,
Ill., S.C., Pa., Conn., Va., N.C.)  (bl) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tens of thousands of homes across the nation have
been flooded again and again while their owners repeatedly
collected federal flood insurance payments, often in amounts
exceeding the total value of the houses, an environmental group
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Wildlife Federation, which based its report on a
comprehensive analysis of government computer records, called on
federal agencies to further expand their relatively new programs
for buying houses in areas prone to flooding and letting low-lying
land revert to a natural state.
</P>
<P>
   Since the devastating Midwest flooding of 1993 shook up federal
flood protection and relief programs, the government has purchased
17,000 properties in flood plains, and Congress is considering
Clinton administration requests to expand this approach instead of
building ever more dams and levees.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management
Agency are both seeking new funds to expand purchases of
flood-prone homes. In May, Michael Armstrong, FEMA's associate
director for mitigation, told a congressional committee that the
agency saves at least $2 in avoided costs for every dollar it
spends removing frequently flooded buildings, and that FEMA could
use up to an additional $300 million for such purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The wildlife group said its study, titled Higher Ground, proved
that many thousands of homes remain susceptible.
</P>
<P>
   The study's authors said Friday that unless more of vulnerable
homes were purchased by the government instead of remaining
insured, losses to the federally operated insurance program, which
is supposed to break even but is already hundreds of millions of
dollars in debt to the Treasury, would continue to mount.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There is a way out: voluntary buyouts, which serve people in
distress, save the taxpayers money, and create environmental
benefits,'' said David Conrad, the wildlife group's project
director.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited 300 communities where the wildlife group saw
high potential for voluntary buyouts of properties because so many
homes were flooded again and again. The areas around New Orleans
and Houston topped the list, but communities in 35 states were
deemed to offer good buyout opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   In one extraordinary case, the records showed that a house in
Houston was flooded 16 times in 18 years, its owner receiving
insurance payments of $806,591 although the house was only worth
$114,480. (Under privacy laws, the government did not disclose the
addresses of the homes in its database or the owners' names.)
</P>
<P>
   The study documented 5,629 homes, or almost 10 percent of the
houses flooded more than once, where cumulative flood insurance
payments exceeded each building's value. In all, these homes were
valued at $307.5 million but received $416.4 million in insurance
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The group examined files on 58,975 single family homes that were
flooded at least twice during any 10-year period between 1978 and
1995 and whose owners won claims for at least $1,000 each time. In
total, these houses received $2.6 billion in flood insurance
payments, the authors said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of FEMA, which runs the program, did not dispute the
report's findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, we think that what they are saying
supports where we are headed,'' said Andrew Sachs, a FEMA official.
``It is in all of our interests to get those structures out of the
flood plain.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the repeated insurance claims were in 15
states: Louisiana and Texas, the study found, followed by Missouri,
New Jersey, New York, Florida, Massachusetts, Mississippi,
California, Illinois, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Connecticut,
Virginia and North Carolina. These states accounted for 90 percent
of the total payments for repetitive floods, according to the
study.

SPRINGFIELD CLOSE TO ADOPTING NEEDLE EXCHANGE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ZACHARY R. DOWDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. _ City councilors here are poised to make
this community the fifth in the state to embrace a needle exchange
program as a way of curbing AIDS, overcoming opponents' charges
that such a program ignores one stubborn, deadly ill to attack
another.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-member body is scheduled to vote on a proposal Monday
night. Officials said the program offering clean hypodermic needles
to intravenous drug users is almost certain to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters in Springfield believe that, unlike in 1996 when the
council defeated a similar proposal, new research on
needle-exchange programs elsewhere and aggressive public relations
have combined this time to push Springfield's leaders toward
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the indications I have are that it will pass,'' Mayor
Michael J. Albano, a supporter, said this week at a press
conference set up to show medical evidence of the critical need for
a program. ``But anything and everything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote comes after the debate heated up in recent weeks. In
Europe, evidence of the programs' effectiveness was presented at an
international conference, and in Washington needle exchanges were
endorsed by the Clinton administration. However, US officials still
won't allow federal dollars to fund the programs.
</P>
<P>
   While four city councilors oppose the plan, four others are
proponents. The swing vote, William T. Foley, who has previously
voted for it, said he is unsure but leaning toward backing it.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, Cambridge, Northampton and Provincetown are the four
other communities that have started needle exchanges since the
state made funding available for up to 10 towns and cities in 1993.
Nationally, there are 120 programs funded by cities, states, and
private groups.
</P>
<P>
   To rally support for needle exchanges, Albano and city Health
and Human Services Director Helen Caulton launched a blitz campaign
that at once highlights the severity of AIDS in this city of
150,000 and the medical weapons against it.
</P>
<P>
   Albano and several city councilors are scheduled to tour
Boston's program Friday in a last-minute fact-finding mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needle exchange is one of those issues that can pit public
health against the perception of morality,'' said Caulton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1996, we have a lot more information that proves
conclusively that needle exchange does work without increasing drug
use,'' Caulton said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing US Centers for Disease Control statistics, she said
Springfield, with about 767 cases of AIDS, now has the 25th highest
rate of infection in the nation. Caulton said 56 percent of those
people with AIDS got the HIV virus by sharing dirty needles.
</P>
<P>
   Caulton said each city councilor had been supplied news reports
of one of the largest studies to date of needle exchange programs.
The study, released this month at the 12th World AIDS Conference in
Geneva, Switzerland, said needle exchange efforts brought AIDS
transmission among New York City's 150,000 intravenous drug users
under control.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Rooke, a city councilor who has led the fight against
needle exchange for several years, said he's unimpressed with the
array of studies, and will vote against the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, whose vote will be decisive, said he will vote in favor
of it unless he uncovers new information that contradicts what he's
heard so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's an effective program but I didn't realize the
amount of controversy and anger it would cause,'' he said. ``We
have to think hard because we're sending a negative social message.
You're giving needles to drug users but, if it's going to stem an
epidemic, then I think it's justified. But I wouldn't want it to
stay in place any longer than necessary.''

`ZORRO' IN DUCES Z'S OF ANOTHER SORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Z as in zzzzzzzz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mask of Zorro'' makes its mark in the annals of adventure,
but for such a big production, it's a small mark and a silly one,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of dashing adventure, the film settles for slash and
flash, with not one but two Zorros.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they should have tried for a chorus line of 20 dancing
Zorros.
</P>
<P>
   The first Zorro is Don Diego De La Vega (Anthony Hopkins), the
only Spanish nobleman living in Mexico in 1820 to speak with an
English accent.
</P>
<P>
   Zorro 1 goes up against the evil Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson), who
has come to Mexico with a vague plan to make people suffer.
</P>
<P>
   The old Zorro gets tossed into prison for 20 years, at which
point Don Rafael decides to make people in California suffer. Don
Diego emerges from prison none the worse for 20 years of starvation
and torture.
</P>
<P>
   Zorro 1 then trains Zorro 2 (Antonio Banderas) how to fight and
wear the black mask.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why Zorro 2 has to wear a mask is unclear since he's a
common thief and no one would know who he was even if they knew
what he looked like.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because the black mask goes so well with the black
cape.
</P>
<P>
   Zorro 2 takes up the fight against Don Rafael and various people
who fall down at the slightest provocation.
</P>
<P>
   Zorro 2 also falls in love with the lovely Elena (Catherine
Zeta-Jones), who thinks she's the daughter of the bad guy even
though she's really the daughter of the good guy.
</P>
<P>
   In between bouts of running from Don Rafael's buffoons, Zorro 2
and Elena engage in a bit of foreplay called strip sword-fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The less exciting fights alternate between the silly and the
serious, with the silly being slightly more entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem with ``The Mask of Zorro'': vast stretches of
tedium in between the sword fights, during which Zorro 1 gives
Zorro 2 too many lectures about how to achieve Zorro-ness.
</P>
<P>
   As for the peasants that the Zorros champion, they have the
curious habit of looking happy in one scene and miserable in the
next. Exactly what is Zorro trying to liberate them from? A life of
bowing and smiling like underpaid extras?
</P>
<P>
   Director Martin Campbell, who created more excitement with
``Golden-Eye,'' can't decide whether he's making a lame comic
adventure or an ordinary straight bad adventure. So he zigs and
zags between the two, creating the wrong kinds of Z's.
</P>
<P>
   Banderas, the first Spaniard to play a Zorro in the movies,
gives much better than he gets from the director. He has the spirit
and the sense of humor to inject some zip into the proceedings, but
he's zapped by the feeble script.
</P>
<P>
   As for the much-publicized passion between Banderas (``Evita'')
and Zeta-Jones (``The Phantom''), it consists of the director
finding endless excuses for her to bend forward so he can show us
what used to be called in Hollywood ``her talents.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's curious conceit is to suggest that Zorro is the
19th-century Batman: a rich guy who lives in a cave, fancies a cape
and has a dark side.
</P>
<P>
   Two or three of the fights he stages have amusing moments
because they borrow heavily from two great sword adventures: ``The
Princess
</P>
<P>
   Bride'' and Richard Lester's ``The Three Musketeers.''
</P>
<P>
   In between the swordplay, he asks the question: How many long
speeches about nothing of importance do we need in a two-hour-plus
adventure movie? About half as many as ``The Mask of Zorro''
contains.
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG-13, ``The Mask of Zorro'' contains brief nudity and
extensive violence, which is too sadistically graphic for a movie
being pitched to kids. 2 stars. &QL;

CALIFORNIA PRIMARY MOVE DISTURBS NEW ENGLAND STATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ California is moving toward holding its
presidential primary in 2000 on the same day five New England
states hold their ``Yankee Day'' vote, prompting concern that the
region's importance in the election may be diminished.
</P>
<P>
   California's move is considered one of the most significant
preliminary political events leading up to the 2000 presidential
campaign. Not only would it force candidates to spend more time and
money in California _ and much less in New England _ but it could
also harm efforts by lesser-known candidates to make a
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, California is trying to convince Washington and Oregon
to hold their votes on the same day, creating an unprecedented
Pacific Coast primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is getting to be a bigger mess than ever,'' said
Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin, the state's top
election official. Galvin, calling the matter a ``political and
civic crisis,'' met earlier this week in Utah with many of his
counterparts from other states in an effort to resolve the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin revealed for the first time publicly that he is willing
to schedule a later date for the Massachusetts primary if all the
states would agree to a system of regional primaries, with the
order rotating every four years. But officials from the other
states are not close to agreeing to a regional primary system.
</P>
<P>
   With relatively little notice, legislation to switch the
California primary date has gained momentum in the last several
months. California's Senate approved the measure last May, and the
state Assembly is expected to vote on it within weeks, with the
sponsors predicting it will pass. Governor Pete Wilson, who may run
for president in 2000 and could benefit from an early primary in
his state, has said he will sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Wilson Thursday sought to calm concerns in New
England, a region he had hoped would be a stronghold during his
failed 1996 campaign. Wilson spokesman Sean Walsh said tying
together votes in five New England states and California on March 7
would give a boost to moderate Republican candidates _ presumably
including Wilson, if he runs again.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Walsh said, Republican primaries in recent years
have been dominated by conservative states, exemplified by the
mostly Southern states that participate in ``Super Tuesday'' the
second week of March.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Governor Jeanne Shaheen, meanwhile, tried to put a
positive spin on California's effort to hold its election on March
7, saying the Granite State's first-in-the-nation primary, to be
two weeks earlier, might become even more important.
</P>
<P>
   California's effort is headed by state Senator Jim Costa, a
Fresno Democrat who said he has been pushing some form of the
legislation for the last 18 years. Costa said he is on the verge of
victory and is unconcerned about criticism from the East.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the population of New Hampshire?'' Costa asked. ``My
Senate district has 850,000 people. I am less concerned about New
Hampshire being first than in setting up an orderly process.''
</P>
<P>
   California is the nation's most populous state, with 32 million
people, while New Hampshire has 1.16 million people.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire still would hold the first primary under Costa's
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Super Tuesday was created,'' Shaheen said, ``it was said
it would make those states more important and diminish the
importance of New Hampshire and Iowa. What they did in fact was
make New Hampshire and Iowa more important.'' Iowa holds its
presidential caucus before the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some political observers believe New Hampshire is becoming
less relevant. For years, the state boasted that a candidate had to
win in New Hampshire to become president. But in 1992, Bill Clinton
came in second to Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts and went on
to win the Democratic nomination. In 1996, Robert Dole came in
second to Patrick Buchanan and won the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Shaheen said New Hampshire offers a far better
opportunity for lesser-known and less-well-funded candidates to
build standing by meeting voters one-on-one, something far more
difficult in California, where most campaigning is done by
expensive television ads.
</P>
<P>
   Five other New England states _ Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine,
Connecticut and Rhode Island _ joined to create the Yankee Day
primary in 1996 to increase the region's clout.
</P>
<P>
   But if California goes through with its plan, and no changes are
made by other states, March 7 could be a crowded primary day. In
addition to five New England states, primaries or caucuses are also
tentatively scheduled by New York, Maryland, Georgia, Minnesota and
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   With so many primaries held so early, there would be less chance
for a relatively unknown candidate to break through in Iowa or New
Hampshire, as Jimmy Carter did in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire law requires the state to hold the first primary _
with voting at least 10 days before other states. But many other
states have scheduled early primaries to gain influence in the
critical early days of the campaign season.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Costa helped enact legislation that moved up
California's primary from June to the last Tuesday in March. But
the party nominations were locked up long before Californians had a
chance to vote. Costa said California Republicans haven't had a
meaningful role in the GOP primary since the 1964 contest between
Nelson Rockefeller and Barry Goldwater, and the state's Democrats
have not had much of a primary voice since the 1972 race between
Hubert Humphrey and George McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Costa said, candidates view California as a political
bank, siphoning millions of dollars in contributions from the state
and spending the money in New Hampshire and other places with early
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been reduced to becoming the automatic teller machine
for presidential aspirants,'' said Costa.

WHITE HOUSE THREATENS FOREIGN WORKER   BILL VETO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Announcing its stand on an important issue for high-tech
companies, the White House threatened Thursday to veto a Senate
bill that would raise the number of foreign workers admitted to the
United States to work as computer programs and in other skilled
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, White House press secretary Michael
McCurry suggested President Clinton favors a House proposal. The
House bill increases the number of foreign workers, but it also
requires US companies to certify that they laid off no US workers
in order to hire a foreigner, and that they tried to recruit an
American before hiring a foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   Employers, particularly high-tech firms, want the right to hire
more foreigners because, they say, the booming economy has left a
shortage of skilled Americans. But they are resisting the ``no
layoff'' and recruitment requirements as an unnecessary government
intrusion into their hiring practices.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee voted to increase the number of
skilled foreigners admitted each year to about 115,000, from 65,000
today, on so-called H-1B visas. But the committee also voted to
impose the new requirements on employers who use the foreign labor.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also approved the additional visas, without the new
requirements for employers. Some House Republican leaders
reportedly favor the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   H-1B visas allow a foreigner to work in the United States for
six years.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said the president's advisers would recommend that he
veto any bill that does not require employers to show that they
have tried to recruit Americans and have not laid off Americans
before hiring foreigners. The president believes any bill must also
have ``a significant training component'' for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry's statement drew criticism from an aide to Senator
Spencer Abraham, the Michigan Republican who sponsored the Senate
bill. ``For a president and vice president who claim to be friendly
with the high-tech community, this was a very unfriendly move,''
said Joseph McMonigle, Abraham's spokesman.

   WOLFSBURG, Germany _ It isn't enough to buy Rolls-Royce Motor
Cars and Lamborghini, the Italian sports car manufacturer.
Volkswagen AG chairman Ferdinand Piech also wants to build a
monument to the company he rescued from decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auto City 2000,'' a theme park being built at a cost of nearly
$400 million near Volkswagen headquarters here, is a testimony to
Piech's consuming ambition. It will feature at least eight separate
pavilions to showcase Volkswagen's brands. It will also ifclude a
luxury hotel, a yacht pier and a museum that will let people
test-drive cars in virtual reality.
</P>
<P>
   Well, why not? The company that pioneered the homely, no-frills
Beetle is moving upscale. After a fierce bidding war against BMW
AG, Volkswagen completed its purchase of Rolls-Royce, which also
makes Bentley roadsters, for nearly $800 million this month. That
came on the heels of an agreement for VW's Audi unit to buy
Lamborghini SpA, for what is thought to be about $100 million. And
it recently entered a joint venture with Porsche to build luxury
sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   This series of rapid-fire actions, along with other moves, has
startled Volkswagen's rivals and excited investors, who are
swapping endless rumors about Piech's next deal. But while it might
seem hard to imagine the Beetle and the Bentley under one roof _
Volls Woyce, as one cartoonist envisioned it _ Piech appears to be
extremely serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The umbrella strategy is that we want to provide mobility for
everybody's needs,'' said Jens Neumann, the chief financial officer
of Volkswagen and a board member. ``We haven't diversified in the
old sense of the word, into a conglomerate. We are in the mobility
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, that is likely to mean a concerted attack on
the luxury markets dominated by BMW and Daimler-Benz's Mercedes,
perhaps by a line of lower-priced ``Baby Bentleys'' from a
re-engineered Rolls-Royce. It also means an expansion in the truck
business, whether by acquisition, alliance or a go-it-alone
strategy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Piech has the money. In the five years since he became chairman,
Volkswagen has recovered from its catastrophic decline and become a
huge money machine. Sales are climbing rapidly, powered by popular
new versions of the Volkswagen Golf and the more upscale Audi.
Thanks largely to the new Beetle, which went on sale in the United
States in March, Volkswagen's U.S. sales soared 50 percent in the
first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen's expanding profit margins have allowed it to
accumulate enormous amounts of cash _ currently about $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Piech wants more. As the grandson of Ferdinand Porsche, who
conceived the original Beetle, he is determined to increase
Volkswagen's size and its prestige. He also seems to carry a sense
of being on the ``wrong'' side of the Porsche family _ the plebeian
Volkswagen side rather than the patrician Porsche side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even today, there is some kind of unspoken law in our
family,'' Piech said in a recent interview with the German car
magazine Auto Motor Sport. ``Porsche is Stuttgart, and Piech is
Salzburg,'' the Piech family home.
</P>
<P>
   Neumann, in an interview Thursday at Volkswagen headquarters,
did not discourage widespread speculation that Volkswagen wanted to
attack the Mercedes S-Class and BMW 7-series with an expanded line
of Bentleys.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good idea!'' he said with a grin, as if he had just
heard it for the first time. While insisting that Volkswagen is
still analyzing its options, he said there were ``lots of
opportunities'' to build up Rolls-Royce and Bentley. ``With our
technology in the mass markets, we could probably improve the
price-value relationship of these cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say Piech has good reason to push into the
market for luxury cars, in part because Daimler-Benz is attacking
downward with subcompacts like the Mercedes A-Class and the Smart
car. And when Daimler announced its stunning agreement to take over
Chrysler Corp., it instantly positioned itself to offer both mass
and class.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Volkswagen has said it plans to bolster Rolls-Royce
and Bentley production to 10,000 cars a year from 2,000. That would
still be an almost negligible number, but many experts think it
isn't the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Reitman, an automobile analyst at Merrill Lynch,
predicts that Piech also plans to develop a line of lower-cost
Bentleys, which now sell for more than $200,000 each. Reitman
thinks Volkswagen will try to develop ``Baby Bentleys'' that would
be closer in price to the $120,000 top-line Mercedes S-Class sedan
or the most expensive BMWs. It is easy to imagine, Reitman said,
that Volkswagen could produce as many as 30,000 to 40,000 Bentleys.
Mercedes produces about 44,000 S-Class sedans in its peak years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Objectively, the Audi A8 is as good as the S-Class or BMWs 7
series,'' Reitman said. ``The problem is that you cannot charge
those kinds of prices with the Audi badge.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains far from clear, though, whether taking VW so far
upscale will work. Ford Motor Co. paid $2.4 billion for Jaguar, the
venerable British sports car manufacturer, and then invested more
than $6 billion to modernize it. Ford says Jaguar now turns a
profit, though it won't say how much. Industry analysts say it is
still tiny compared with the investment.
</P>
<P>
   In Rolls-Royce, Volkswagen is at least acquiring a company that
is making money. After coming close to bankruptcy, it was taken
over by Vickers PLC and rehabilitated over the last several years.
It earned about 30 million pounds, or $49 million, on revenues of
300 million pounds, or $491 million, last year.
</P>
<P>
   Piech is also nursing ambitions in the even more exclusive area
of high-performance sports cars. At the Geneva Auto Show in the
spring, Volkswagen introduced a concept car called the W-12 that
looks like a Ferrari or a Maserati. In June came Audi's letter of
intent to acquire Lamborghini, which makes about 200 cars a year
but will provide Volkswagen with an additional famous brand name.
Volkswagen is also negotiating to acquire Bugatti SpA, which went
bankrupt three years ago but still has a prestigious name.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen's joint venture with Porsche to make sport utility
vehicles is likely to prove more substantial. Volkswagen had long
been eager to enter the joint venture, but Porsche executives were
nervous about developing a vehicle that would be so different from
their established line of high-priced sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement announced last month, Porsche will assume
most of the design work and Volkswagen will be responsible for the
manufacturing. The two companies hope to produce about 100,000
luxury sport utility vehicles beginning in 2002. About 80,000 would
be produced for Volkswagen, which is expected to sell them for
about $55,000 each. The rest would be produced for Porsche and sell
for about $85,000 each. Porsche has said it will invest about $550
million in the project; Volkswagen has not said what it expects to
spend.
</P>
<P>
   But all of these projects are tiny in comparison with
Volkswagen's core car businesses, which provide the muscle for new
ventures. Piech, who joined Audi in 1972 and worked his way to the
top ranks of Volkswagen, was elevated to chairman in 1993 when the
company was near financial collapse. Its costs were high, its
quality had deteriorated and its plants were among the most
inefficient in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Piech, an engineer by training, worked to lower costs and
revitalize Volkswagen's various brands. In addition to VW and Audi,
the company owns Seat, based in Spain, and Skoda, based outside of
Prague. Piech recruited Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, General
Motors' head of purchasing, who had cut billions of dollars in
costs by forcing suppliers to offer better prices.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen's growth has been almost as remarkable as its
previous decline. Revenues jumped to 113 billion marks, or $62.7
billion, in 1997 from 80 billion marks, or $44 billion, in 1994,
and analysts expect them to reach 127 billion marks, or $70.5
billion, this year. Net income climbed to 1.36 billion marks, or
$755 million, from 150 million marks, or $86 million, and is
expected to reach 2.8 billion marks, or $1.6 billion, this year.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Volkswagen, now trading at 183 marks, or $101.60, have
risen fivefold since Piech took over.
</P>
<P>
   But company executives and analysts predict that profits will
climb even more quickly over the next year or two. VW is
consolidating its different models on four separate ``platforms'' _
the interior components like the chassis, brake systems and
electronics of a car. That saves money on parts, simplifies
production and allows factories to shift more easily between
models.
</P>
<P>
   By the end 1997, Volkswagen had shifted about 25 percent of its
production to the four platforms. Jurgen Heinz, an automobile
analyst at West LB Research in Dusseldorf, said the real savings
from the platform strategy were about to hit the bottom line over
the next two years. VW hopes to nearly complete the process _
moving about 90 percent of its production to the four platforms _
by the end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   But Piech has also infuriated rivals and annoyed investors. At a
time when big European companies increasingly embrace notions of
``shareholder value'' and openness, Volkswagen is often opaque and
highhanded. VW shares abruptly plunged about 12 percent last fall,
for instance, after the company announced a plan to sell a huge
block of stock without providing much explanation of why it needed
the money. The company delayed the offering until March, then went
ahead with half the amount of the original plan.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also complain that the company consistently understates
its true profits, a move that allows it to hold on to more cash and
keep better control. Though German companies are famous for their
conservative accounting, Volkswagen has gone out of its way to take
additional charges. When Volkswagen results are calculated along
the lines of American standards, analysts said, its 1997 income
jumps to 3.2 billion marks, or $1.8 billion, from 1.36 billion
marks.
</P>
<P>
   Piech has not worried much about creating the image of a nice
guy _ and he does not have one. Though Volkswagen has acknowledged
for some time that it used thousands of slave workers during World
War II, when it was a chief weapons supplier for Adolf Hitler,
Piech flatly refused to compensate victims. Earlier this month,
under the threat of being sued, Volkswagen agreed to set up a fund.
</P>
<P>
   He has angered rivals as well. When General Motors accumulated
extensive evidence several years ago that Lopez, its former
purchasing chief, had taken reams of internal data with him when he
joined Volkswagen, Piech dismissed the allegations until just a few
days before he reached a billion-dollar out-of-court settlement.
</P>
<P>
   When BMW outbid Volkswagen at an auction for Rolls-Royce this
spring, Piech scuttled the deal with a sweetened offer to Vickers.
BMW, which supplies engines used in the Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph,
immediately announced that it would stop as soon as its contract
expires next July.
</P>
<P>
   Piech was not ruffled. He agreed to buy Cosworth, a manufacturer
of high-performance engines that Vickers also owned. Volkswagen
officials say their own engines will be ready to fill the void
immediately.

DESPITE SLUGGISH SALES AND RATINGS, TURNER STILL UPBEAT ON GOODWILL
GAMES  
 (JT )
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Who cares if the first three Goodwill Games have lost
$109 million? Not Ted Turner. On the eve of the fourth edition _
starting in New York Saturday with opening ceremonies at Battery
Park _ Turner abruptly dashed across his 29th floor office in Time
Warner's Manhattan headquarters to fiddle with his deskside
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ha! I made $150 million today!'' he said, analyzing the
late-afternoon action of his 60 million shares of Time Warner
stock. Eyes atwinkle, he told a visitor, ``But I've lost $50
million since you've been here!''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Turner's paper gain on Wednesday amounted to $251
million by 1:20 p.m. and had plummeted to $75 million when he
punched his computer keys. But it recovered to $120 million by
day's end. His shares were worth $5.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, the Goodwill Games _ a 15-sport spectacle starring
1,500 athletes from 60 countries _ are affordable, a minor item for
a $13.3 billion corporation. They were affordable before the Turner
Broadcasting System merged with Time Warner in October 1996. They
remain affordable now.
</P>
<P>
   And what's $109 million when you're ending the Cold War? ``Yeah,
we helped end the Cold War,'' he said, leaning perilously far back
in his chair and distractedly watching the Mets-Braves game on a
corner TV. ``It's hard to tell what's the first straw or the last.
You can't get too much goodwill.''
</P>
<P>
   There will certainly be more. Saturday at Madison Square Garden,
Turner will announce the site for the 2001 Goodwill Games, which is
expected to be in Asia or Australia. The usual four-year cycle is
being shortened once to avoid future conflicts for the attention of
viewers and advertisers with the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Why does Turner keeping staging them? The Soviet Union is dead.
The United States won the Cold War. The truth is, he likes them.
They're not as big as the Olympics, but so what? He'll still
broadcast them in 130 countries. They will fill 47 hours on the TBS
Superstation, plus 10 on CBS and 8 on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't caused trouble,'' he said. ``How can getting
athletes on the field more often be bad?''
</P>
<P>
   And by paying prize money of $5 million, plus bonuses for world
records, he has lured Michael Johnson, Dan O'Brien, Michelle Kwan
and other world-class athletes. Ten athletes are being paid
six-figure fees to promote the games.
</P>
<P>
   The Goodwill Games are as much a pampered Turner scion as Cable
News Network, the Atlanta Braves or his new 24-hour ``Cold War''
series on TBS. He insisted that Time Warner never tried to axe the
Goodwill Games in the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't lay down the law,'' said Turner, who owns 10 percent
of the company but is second in command to the chairman, Gerald
Levin. ``I'm not the big dog. But we were already committed to
doing this in New York, and Jerry was excited. It's like it was
predestined for New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Schiller, the president of Turner Sports, said: ``He
really feels it's very good programming, with the sports that have
the most interest with the public. He thinks it's an event you can
put in places where the Olympics don't fit. And he loves the idea
of being in the biggest city.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wussler, the former president of Turner Broadcasting,
helped create the first Goodwill Games in Moscow in 1986. It
included the first competition between American and Soviet athletes
since the United States boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics in
Moscow and the Soviets boycotted the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something he created,'' Wussler said. ``It's his child
and he wants to continue it forever if possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Goodwill Games' impact on the Olympics will be long debated.
Turner brought the superpowers together when the Olympics kouldn't.
If the Goodwill Games did not exist, would the boycotting nations
have gotten together in Seoul in 1988?
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pound, a member of the International Olympic Committee,
said: ``They've had any impact at all. If there ever was a use for
them, that time has past. They're just a made-for-TV Olympics.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wherever they have been played, the Goodwill Games have not
proven to be TV bonanzas. Nielsen ratings on TBS for the 1994 Games
in St. Petersburg, Russia, tumbled by nearly half, to a 1.4, from
the 1990 Games in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   And so far only about 200,000 of between 550,000 and 600,000
tickets have been sold for the Games in New York. The buzz about
Goodwill IV is not overwhelming sports fans in Manhattan, Long
Island and Staten Island, where the 15 sports will ba played.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I going to do?'' Turner asked. ``Let's see how it
goes. It's there for people who want it. My driver asked me about
how to get skating tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Turner sat in a sweltering Boys &AMP; Girls Club in
downtown Manhattan, beaming when a marching band performed for him
during a Goodwill Games presentation and smiling beatifically as
politicians extolled his sporting vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy,'' Turner said. ``It was before Tailwind''_ the
CNN report on the use of nerve gas by the United States military
that proved to be wrong and was retracted. ``It's too early to tell
if that'll bring me down during the Games. But you can only mourn
so long. Even people on Death Row laugh once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, a chuckle: after his Braves finished thrashing the Mets,
12-1, he aimed his remote control at the TV, seeking CNN. ``Let's
see if we're screwing up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These Goodwill Games are different than past ones. They have
been trimmed from 2,500 ath,etes in 23 sports, slashing sports like
yachting, which irked Turner. ``But more people walk on land,'' he
reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   The mission has been redefined, from fostering goodwill between
countries to raising $2 million for the Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs of
America and UNICEF International. And promotion has been broadened
immensely because of Time Warner's ownership of Turner. Forty-three
Time Warner divisions are involved; Warner Bros. cartoon characters
are being for advertising, HBO is carrying boxing, magazines like
Sports Illustrated and Time are running ads.
</P>
<P>
   The Games' structure has also been revised. Time Warner is the
owner, and does not award the event to an organizing committee.
``By the end in St. Petersburg, people ended up hating each
other,'' said Mike Plant, the Goodwill Games president.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to changing the mission, ``Ted was very
receptive,'' Plant said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we probably won't have to rededicate the Games anytime
soon, unless we solve all the problems of kids, will we?'' Turner
said.
</P>
<P>
   But will Time Warner sweat when there are too many unsold
tickets? It's one thing to have rows of empty seats in St.
Petersburg, another in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Plant insisted that last-minute marketing, much of it targeted
to various ethnic groups, will lead to substantial walk-up sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at Atlanta,'' said Plant, who served on the board of
the Atlanta Olympic organizing committee. ``In the end, they had 3
million unsold tickets, out of 11 million. That's a benchmark to
use.''
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors like Canon, Budweiser, Snapple, Sony and Johnson &AMP;
Johnson hope fans and viewers take better notice of the Goodwill
Games than in the past.

GALVESTON IMPOSTOR FACES PROBATION HEARING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By KEVIN MORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ Final arguments are scheduled for Friday in a
probation revocation hearing for a former Galveston civic leader
who faked suicide and abandoned his family in Ohio 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Welsh, 50, known in Galveston since 1983 as Tim
Kingsbury, could be ordered to serve a four-year prison term he
received in December 1996 after authorities here found forged birth
certificates and other documents in his office at the radio station
he managed.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh's former wife, Elizabeth Welsh, learned he was alive and
tracked him down in Texas after probation terms of his 1996 forgery
conviction forced him to use his real Social Security number. She
started looking for her former husband after federal officials
demanded repayment of Social Security benefits the family received
after Welsh was declared dead.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh's real identity was known to only a few people in
Galveston until his former wife filed Ohio charges against him and
he was arrested on an Ohio indictment on Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh pleaded no contest in an Ohio court in April to nonsupport
and complicity-in-theft charges. He was sentenced to four years in
an Ohio prison on those charges and then extradited to Texas for
this week's probation revocation hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston County District Attorney Mike Guarino said Thursday
that even if the probation is revoked here,Welsh probably will be
returned to Ohio to serve prison time there first. The terms would
be served concurrently, Guarino said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors here maintain he violated his 1996 Texas probation
terms by failing to put his real name on all credit cards, loan
documents ``and any other financial documents wherein defendant is
a party.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney David Walker on Thursday called expert
witnesses who testified Welsh legally was not a ``party'' to
property sales and purchases to which he signed his assumed name
when he was president of the Galveston Historical Foundation in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The experts also said bank signature authorization cards he
signed as a foundation officer and as a United Way officer legally
are not ``documents.''
</P>
<P>
   Among prosecution witnesses was Frank W. Jackson III, executive
director of Unitied Way of Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing Welsh's probation terms on the stand, Jackson said:
``As I see this, the bank records, the signature cards, should have
been changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Miller, a retired accountant and one of the owners of the
radio station where Welsh worked, said he was helping with an
income tax form in 1996 when Welsh claimed to have had his name
legally changed. Attorneys, however, said that the defendant could
not have changed his name while on probation.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh was convicted in 1980 of stealing money from Ohio State
University, where he worked as a fund-raiser. He was on probation
when he fled Ohio, leaving his wife and sons, 10 and 6. He later
sent his wife letters saying he would kill himself.

`ZORRO' IS A GRAND OLD SWASHBUCKLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFF SHANNON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The creators of ``The Mask of Zorro'' wanted to reintroduce the
fabled hero to young '90s audiences with an operatic flair, so
they've beefed up the masked avenger's legacy with enough tragedy,
treachery and hard-earned redemption to make it as ripe as anything
Verdi ever staged.
</P>
<P>
   It's a vigorous crowd pleaser that gradually betrays its own
noble ambitions, but it's also got enough gusto and agility to
qualify as a satisfying swashbuckler in the grand old style.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Fairbanks was a better swordsman than either Anthony
Hopkins or Antonio Banderas, who play Zorro here as a
master-student combo, with Don Diego de la Vega (Hopkins) passing
the torch after serving served 20 years of an unjust prison
sentence. But Fairbanks would surely approve of this dual effort of
charismatic stars, and the sly combination of Hopkins' gravity and
Banderas's seductive insouciance.
</P>
<P>
   Top it off with parallel subplots of vengeance and you've got
familial honor of ``Godfather'' proportions, albeit with old-world
etiquette and more witty joie de vivre.
</P>
<P>
   Don Diego was jailed by Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson), the Spanish
governor of Alta California, in a confrontation that cost the life
of Diego's beloved wife (Julietta Rosen) and possession of his
infant daughter Elena, who was raised by Rafael with no knowledge
of her real father's fate. Two decades later, Mexican bandit
Alejandro Murieta (Banderas) suffers a similar loss to Rafael's
ironically-named military henchman Capt. Love (Matt Letscher), who
yearns for the now stunningly beautiful Elena (Catherine
Zeta-Jones).
</P>
<P>
   Having passed his time in the heroic spotlight, Diego grooms
Murieta to be the new Zorro, joining forces to combat Rafael's plot
to exploit Mexicans in his quest to purchase California from Spain.
</P>
<P>
   You can easily figure out the rest of the scenario, which
escalates into a zesty display of swordplay, clever maneuvering and
an explosive free-the-slaves climax. ``The Mask of Zorro'' is more
effective in set-up than payoff, and after piling on its subplots
it gradually gives way to the kind of mayhem that director Martin
Campbell handles so well in his 007 blockbuster ``GoldenEye.''
</P>
<P>
   No telling what young maverick Robert Rodriguez would have done
with the movie; he bailed over contract disputes two months before
cameras rolled. But Cambell seems more in line with the lavish,
glossy vision of Steven Spielberg, who fostered the project and was
once intending to direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mask of Zorro'' has just enough sophistication to satisfy
adults (and a script good enough to attract this stellar cast), but
like ``Braveheart' and ``Rob Roy,'' it's an action-drama with youth
appeal and some indulgent concessions to a mainstream audience.
</P>
<P>
   Even at 136 minutes, the story takes some conspicuous shortcuts
(as when Banderas goes from crude rogue to diplomatic ``gentleman''
virtually overnight) and, after all its dashing fancy, it falls
back on a rousing but routine action finale.
</P>
<P>
   And Zeta-Jones, despite the intelligence and grit of her
character, is basically the target of Banderas's sexy (and
occasionally sexist) humor. It's all delightfully good-natured, but
the now-familiar gag (in which Zorro precisely slices Elena's
night-dress off with his sword) tells you where the movie's (and
Zorro's) priorities lie.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part it's good. It could have been better.
</P>
<P>
   The Mask of Zorro. Directed by Martin Campbell. Screenplay by
John Eskow and Ted Elliott &AMP; Terry Rossio. Cast: Anthony Hopkins,
Antonio Banderas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stuart Wilson, Matt
Letscher. Tri-Star Pictures. 136 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence,
mature humor.

 &HT;    FORMER COMRADES CAST DOUBT ON AIR FORCE NOMINEE'S INTEGRITY
 &HT;    By SHANNON JOYCE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's nominee for secretary of the
Air Force watched Thursday as fellow officers from his former
reserve wing told the Senate Armed Services Committee he had not
been truthful at his first confirmation hearing a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   The daylong hearing addressed several issues in Florida State
Sen. Daryl Jones's past, including how he was grounded as a fighter
pilot in 1991, whether or not he knew he had been overpaid for
about three years, and if he used his position as an officer to
peddle Amway home cleaning products.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony from Jones's former superior officers led some
senators on the panel to express doubt whether he was fit to serve
as Air Force secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Jones told the panel in June that he made the difficult decision
to ground himself after the demands of running for office, rasing
children, and starting a law practice took too much time away from
his fighter pilot training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the decision to ground Daryl Jones and no one else,''
Col. Thomas Dyches told the committee. Dyches was Jones' commanding
officer during his last days as a fighter pilot in Homestead Air
Force Base's 482 Fighter Wing, and said Jones had been warned that
without more practice time in the F-16, he would not be allowed to
continue flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have read and listened to the testimony Mr. Jones gave to
this committee, and sadly I must say that he misrepresented the
facts to you and the American people,'' Dyches said.
</P>
<P>
   Another officer in the reserve unit said he witnessed the
meeting and took notes as Jones threatened to challenge the
decision to take a ground job or face a formal panel to take his
wings.
</P>
<P>
   Jones stood by his original testimony, stating the discrepancies
simply showed two different memories of the same meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because I have a different recollection of an event
doesn't mean I don't have integrity,'' Jones told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he didn't have to accept Dyches' grounding or leave
the reserves. He could have asked to go before a Flight Evaluation
Board, a scrutiny Jones said he believes he would have survived.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Jones said he took Dyches' advice and went home to
think about Dyches' offer to find him a job on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't want to contest that when I knew I wouldn't be
able to take the eight to 10 days'' for training,'' Jones said
about his choice to take the ground job.
</P>
<P>
   Other glitches in Jones' testimony surfaced as well.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Maj. Thomas Massey said he witnessed Jones trying to
sell Amway products to a group of enlisted men during a daylong
training exercise, an action strictly prohibited in the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Massey told Jones to stop, but ``he quickly dismissed my
comments,'' Massey said. ``I was dumbfounded, because he was not
only violating an Air Force regulation, but he was doing it
knowingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican members of the committee said the incidents
point to a fundamental flaw in the personality of a future
secretary of the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Mr. Jones has an insatiable appetite to say
things that aren't true, and that is a very significant issue,''
said Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said he saw Jones's failure to take
accountability for his actions as a disturbing trend in behavior.
</P>
<P>
   After Jones relinquished his flight status, he continued to
collect fighter pilot pay for three years, despite warnings. Jones
said it was an accounting error on the part of the Air Force, and
he had heard that reserve pilots, like their active duty
counterparts, continue to collect flight pay after they've stopped
flying.
</P>
<P>
   Warner said another instance, in which Jones blamed his staff
for listing himself as a fighter pilot on his resume after his
grounding, made him wonder if he would be able take responsibility
for the weighty decisions he would make as Air Force secretary.
</P>
<P>
   While several friends testified to Jones' good character and
strong leadership, none were able to corroborate his accounts of
the grounding or the Amway incident.

 &HT;    Increasing Black Business: Gore announces 1.4 billion loan
program
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Small business advocates in metro Atlanta Thursday
hailed a federal plan aimed at putting $1.4 billion in loans in the
black business community, but warned that the program was useless
if black entrepreneurs didn't have help dealing with complicated
bank loan requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership between the NAACP and the Small Business
Administration is part of an ambitious three-year effort by the SBA
to increase loans to blacks. The plan was unveiled by Vice
President Al Gore Thursday at the NAACP annual convention in
Atlanta. The federal agency has enlisted the NAACP's aid to extend
its reach into the black community.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, with a black population of about 68 percent, stands to
benefit significantly from the SBA program . The area ranks second
only to New York in the number of black-owned firms, according to
SBA data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta is fertile ground for increasing opportunities because
there are so many startups of African American -owned businesses
who could grow their business if they could get access to cheaper
capital _ which is what is possible through the SBA. And that's
really at the heart of this,'' said SBA chief Aida Alvarez, who
spent Thursday in Atlanta meeting with businesspeople, attending
the NAACP conference and touring the One Stop Capital Shop, a small
business help center in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Under the loan initiative, black entrepreneurs will conceivably
be able to walk into their local NAACP branch to get help in
starting or expanding their business. Officials at the 69 SBA
district offices, including Atlanta, and local NAACP branches will
be working closely in the future on workshops and seminars designed
to make it easier for blacks to get through the cumbersome business
loan process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most significant step since the institution of
minority procurement programs,'' said Georgia Tech economics
professor Thomas D. Boston. Boston was among 30 Atlanta area
business leaders who met with Gore and Alvarez Thursday to discuss
ways to assist and help increase the number of black-owned
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a loan (program) targeted specifically for black
businesses,'' he added. `` Most government programs have been open
to all minority and women-owned businesses. Often, those programs
get skewed in favor of women.''
</P>
<P>
   Leona Barr-Davenport, president of the Atlanta Business League,
a small business advocacy group of about 300 companies, called the
loan initiative an excellent opportunity for black-owned businesses
to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   `` With the way the country is going with affirmative action, we
need as many vehicles in place as possible to allow our businesses
to function and flourish in light of some of those state agencies
that still don't provide the kinds of help to African-American and
small business owners as they ought to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But without expert help in putting the loan package together,
there won't be large increases in the number of black-owned
businesses, said Carlotta Roberts, director of Kennesaw State
University's Small Business Development Center. About 20 percent of
the 300 clients the centers sees annually are black.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good start,'' she said. ``It's an attempt to get
more small business owners qualified.''

 &HT;    Gore preaches to choir from his pulpit
 &HT;    By Christy Oglesby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The reverend, ... well actually Vice President Al
Gore made a convert of NAACP delegate Esther Trice Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the money _ $1.4 billion for black businesses _ that
did it. And it wasn't the monument _ the newly authorized one for
Martin Luther King Jr. in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   It was the man, said Trice from Mount Union, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting Scripture, prophesying redemption and sometimes
borrowing a Southern preacher's inflection, Gore won over Trice
who, at best, was lukewarm about his intentions and skeptical about
his motives before he took the podium to address the thousands
attending the annual convention of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before Gore's 45-minute address in which he
declared America still needed affirmative action and vowed to
resolve the financial blight plaguing black farmers.
</P>
<P>
   That was before Gore proclaimed, ``We have the ability in our
souls, given to us by God, to transcend racism!'' And it was before
Trice found out about Gore's father, whose political career ended
when he refused to sign in 1956 the Southern Manifesto, which
pledged to reverse the court decision that integrated schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know about his father,'' Trice said almost
apologetically. ``My heart just goes out to him. Sometimes you can
carry the seed, and sometimes you can't. He truly carries the seed.
I have to take back all that stuff I said before (Gore's speech).''
</P>
<P>
   Like a number of delegates at the convention Thursday morning,
Trice wondered about the timing of the $1.4 billion in loans being
made available to black business owners over the next two years.
She was among those who believed it was a move for Gore to curry
favor among black voters as he prepares to run for president.
``This is one of his candidacy moves,'' she surmised.
</P>
<P>
   People still swim in the river where she lives, and she wants to
open a fitness club with a pool. Before Gore spoke, she said she
would decide her political position depending on whether that money
would help businesses with just a few employees. And there would be
another test: ``It'll depend on his speech ... if he's looking at
you or looking through you.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidayon Mayers-Kelley employs 14 people in her two Atlanta
businesses. The timing of the NAACP partnership with the Small
Business Administration that Gore announced would infuse $1.4
billion in loans into black businesses didn't bother her.
``Everybody who does something, does it for a reason,'' she said.
``Sometimes you can accidentally do some good.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayers-Kelley, who said she was a Clinton-Gore supporter before
she was aware of the money, was more concerned about whether the
money would help black businesses that employ just a handful of
people and if the SBA would get input from local businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses that employ a handful or 200 people would qualify for
the loans, said Billy Max Paul, the SBA's southeast regional
administrator. The goal is to quadruple the number of black-owned
businesses by 2000, he said. Black people comprise 12 percent of
the population, Paul said, but 3.6 percent of business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Pickney of Eutawville, S.C., didn't care about Gore's
motives. ``I look at (the money) as they seeing they need it,''
said Pickney who said she would vote for Gore. ``He's the vice
president of Clinton and Clinton has done a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Gore's talk of how many African-Americans Clinton had
appointed to national and cabinet positions that brought the crowd
to its feet one of a half dozen times. As Gore rattled off the list
that included secretarys of energy, agriculture, commerce,
transportation, labor, veterans affairs and surgeon general, NAACP
Chairman Julian Bond stood banging his hand on the table with glee
as the crowd waved miniature American flags in the air.
</P>
<P>
   With a few Bible verses, Gore raised his voice in a pledge for
unity to provide better employment, education and economic
opportunities for black Americans. ``Rejoice with them that do
rejoice, and weep with them that weep,'' he bellowed. ``Be of the
same mind one toward another. ... And the crooked places shall be
made straight and the rough places plain: And the glory of the Lord
shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together!''
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd burst into strands of ``We Shall Overcome,'' Trice
proclaimed her conversion and declared Gore sincere. ``He looked at
us,'' she said. ``He looked at us!''

BILL BLOCKING ATM FEES DEAD FOR THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran said Thursday that
legislation banning automated teller machine surcharges is dead for
this year, allowing BankBoston Corp. and Fleet Financial Group Inc.
to move ahead with plans to impose $1 fees.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the two banks declined to say when they would start
charging customers of other banks who use their ATMs, but it
probably won't be long.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston has said preparations to impose the fees are going
according to schedule and testing of the system should start soon.
The banks are required to give the state 30 days notice before they
begin assessing the fees.
</P>
<P>
   Most smaller banks had supported the legislation, fearing
customers would desert in droves if the two big banks start
charging them a fee each time they use one of the banks' ATMs.
BankBoston and Fleet say they doubt that will happen and add that
the fees are the cost of having the convenience of using another
bank's ATM network.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran gave no explanation for his action Thursday, but his
comments in recent days have indicated that he did not want to
meddle in an industry dispute.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision again underscored the power of the House
speaker to do pretty much whatever he wants even though he is only
one of 160 House members.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the House had signed a petition asking that the bill
banning surcharges be released from the House Ways and Means
Committee so the full chamber could vote on it. The bill passed the
Senate unanimously 38-0 last year and had the support of Acting
Governor Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   The House Ways and Means Committee, which suppressed the bill
apparently on the speaker's orders, had sent conflicting signals in
recent months on what it would do with the bill. On the same day
recently, the spokeswoman for the committee told one reporter that
the bill was not going anywhere and told another that it would be
released in some form after the budget had been approved.

COMMENTARY: THE WAR AGAINST BIBI  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On May 31, 1996, Benjamin Netanyahu was elected prime minister
of Israel, the first to be chosen by direct vote. On that same day
most of the world's governments began a political war to destroy
him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is still in place. So is the international effort to
bring him and his conservative government down and return the
defeated Labor party to power. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to understand the day-by-day negotiation
stories or the incessant attacks and denunciation of Israel at the
United Nations, or the Clinton administration's taut and sometimes
insulting attitude toward the Israeli government without grasping
the reality and magnitude of the international campaign against
Netanyahu, and its objectives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first goal is to achieve not merely getting rid of Netanyahu
but also the policy for which Israelis chose him. The policy is
peace with Palestine and giving land for it _ but in return getting
borders that would give Israel some protection against another war
by Arab states, or war by terrorism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Labor would bring back a policy that Yasser Arafat has accepted.
It would meet virtually all Palestinian ambitions for full
possession of the West Bank including the hills and ravines that
since Israel's victory in 1967 have given it some barriers against
attack.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's Israeli opponents are willing to take the risk, for
the advantages of ``peace now.'' That would bring Israel worldwide
cheek-pinching. They campaign against him at home, which is their
right, and around the world, which is disgusting.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Muslim motives are unconcealed. Palestinian poets still sing of
Israel's end. Netanyahu is a hindrance to that goal. For other
Muslim peoples, hatred of Israel is religious duty. Christians
criticize Christians. Jews tear each other apart. But far from
Israel, Muslims scream jihad; the world nods ever so
understandingly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among non-Muslim nations: India trots docilely behind Arafat to
mute Muslim support of Pakistan. China, Japan and the Europeans,
particularly the French and Russians, see Palestinians as their way
to expanding Mideast influence _ also known as oil-development
contracts.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Chirac of France is no cute soccer fan when he
conspires with Egypt to warn of a European boycott of Israeli
agriculture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, Israel has no chance whatsoever against
the Arabs _ proved during Labor's rule as well as Netanyahu's. The
whole place is now run by blocs. Europe's democracies often lead
other bloc-heads in anti-Israeli enthusiasm.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Israel has no hope of getting one of the 10 rotating Security
Council seats. It is permitted to show up to hear itself denounced
by states like the Sudan, which allows slavery and the murder of
Christians. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The United States is Israel's best friend. But as long as the
Administration uses threats of withdrawal of support, pressures
Israel and favors the Palestinians, it will also be Israel's best
blackmailer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's Mideast policy advisers are mostly Jews.
They were entranced by former Labor Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
They glowed at his talk of building rose gardens with Arabs at
once, even if Arabs were not keen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These Clinton aides invested their passions and careers in
Labor. Oh, the downfall of Netanyahu _ how sweet the thought. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has broken its official promise that
Israel alone would decide its borders and withdrawals. It warns
that the U.S. will blame Israel if negotiations collapse.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With that backing, Arafat does not give an inch, nor fulfill his
annual promise to disband the terrorism apparatus; evermore he
reaches out to Hamas. And he has never plugged the sewer of
Palestinian propaganda about the curse of Jews to the world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under U.S. pressure, Netanyahu is expected to make land
concessions faster than he wanted. But he says he will not
surrender the territory until Arafat's actions begin to match his
yo-yo promises _ one piece of land for one unfulfilled promise,
another for another.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Netanyahu peace policy would be tricky and risk-taking.
Israel is for gamblers.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gamblers, not fools. So _ some Israelis build their nation's
strength with their computer genius. Some count on the Torah and
Author, some on political democracy. Some become paratroopers.
There are no guarantees, but as a combination it is difficult to
think of a better.

`FALSETTOLAND': THEATER SUCCESS VIA PURITY OF SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At a time when nontraditional casting no longer seems
so rare, or even so nontraditional, leave it to a little-known
group called the National Asian-American Theater Company to find a
way to make it novel again. The troupe has taken ``Falsettoland,''
William Finn's lyrical paean to Jewish angst, with its aggressively
Jewish New York sensibility and multiple references to gefilte
fish, and recast it with Asian-American actors.
</P>
<P>
   Does the gambit work?
</P>
<P>
   Let's put it this way: You should be so talented.
</P>
<P>
   The production, directed with a respectful delicacy by Alan
Muraoka, is sung with such elan and technical accomplishment that
the dissonant moments _ the cast members in yarmulkes and prayer
shawls, for example _ are simply nullified by the winning ensemble.
What one approaches nervously as a potentially embarrassing put-on
is in reality a rather loving tribute to, among other things, the
joy of being in a musical. Here are seven singing Asian actors who
seem to be declaring to audiences and casting directors alike that
they would like to be considered for parts in musicals other than
``Miss Saigon'' and ``The King and I.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the effortless sophistication and compassion of Finn's
score, and the actors' evident vocal gifts, who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   It's surprising how rapidly your mind adjusts for superficial
incongruities when a work is approached with such purity of spirit.
For the production at the Vineyard Theater, which grew out of a
successful benefit performance in February, Muraoka and company
have wisely chosen to play it straight. Only in a teasing prologue,
in which one of the actors, Merv Maruyama, pretends to hypnotize
the rest of the cast into assuming their less than ideally suited
roles, does the director disarmingly acknowledge the show's risky
conceit. And only a theatergoer in a black mood would begrudge them
the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falsettoland,'' a chamber musical Finn wrote as the sequel to
his earlier work, ``March of the Falsettos'' _ the two were merged
in 1992 to create the Broadway musical ``Falsettos'' _ returns at
an advantageous moment. The composer is represented by Lincoln
Center Theater's production of his newest musical, ``A New Brain,''
which opened to mixed reviews and a sense of muddled intention.
``Falsettoland,'' in contrast, is Finn at the top of his playfully
twisted game. Both sardonic and sentimental, it shows off the range
of his songwriting talent, from the nervous comic patter of ``The
Baseball Game'' to the three-hanky schmaltz of ``Unlikely Lovers.''
</P>
<P>
   The sung-through piece has an incontrovertibly Jewish pedigree:
At the heart of the story of Marvin (Jason Ma) and his life and
loves, is the question of how, and whether, Jason (Kennedy
Kanagawa), the son of Marvin and his ex-wife, Trina (Ann Harada),
will celebrate his bar mitzvah. It is, of course, in Finn's
send-ups of the ritualized neuroses of Jewish New Yorkers in the
1980s that Muraoka's cast has the most difficulty reinterpreting.
Neither Ma nor Maruyama, who portrays Mendel, the Uber-shrink, can
quite manage to vibrate at his character's excessive energy level.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ma's elegant rendition of the lovely ``What More
Can I Say?'' as uncluttered as the bare-bones set by SaSXk%I

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MONTE CARLO, Monaco _ The stars aren't here for the U.S. team that
is training for the FIBA World Championship of Basketball.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are no NBA players within thousands of miles _ other than
Hakeem Olajuwon, who is traveling in Europe on his way to Mecca _
but there will be stars on the U.S. team of replacement players.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, nobody knows who they will be.
</P>
<P>
   But just about everybody connected with USA Basketball is
banking on former Texas Tech standout Jason Sasser being one of the
leaders of this team, which has been thrust into the role of
underdog against the world.
</P>
<P>
   Even Rudy Tomjanovich, the coach who strives to treat the 12th
man the same as the No. 1 player, knows Sasser ranks as one of the
toughest and most effective players on his squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking with (Sioux Falls Skyforce coach) Mo McHone, who
has been real good in evaluating CBA players, and he told us that
he (Sasser) is the kind of guy you're going to want on the floor,''
Tomjanovich said of the 6-7 Sasser. ``Mo said he's going to find a
way to will it into the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``And just watching him the past week or so, that (scouting
report) is right on the money. Sometimes the ball looks like it
squirts out of his hands, but he gets it done. He's what you'd call
a scorer without a great shot. He has a knack for getting the ball
in the basket. And he's got such a tough mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy who is going to be there at the end of a game for
us and the kind of guy we're going to look for to make big plays
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad stamp of approval for a guy who, for two years since
leaving Texas Tech, has had what can only be called a near-great
career.
</P>
<P>
   When you are the Continental Basketball Association Rookie of
the Year, follow that up by being one of that league's top five
scorers the next season and mix in six weeks in Spain and three
10-day NBA contracts, it's evident you know how to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   But for two years, Sasser has been an ``almost'' player. He has
almost been able to nail down a permanent NBA job.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he's perhaps the leader of this U.S. basketball pack.
He views this run for America's pride as another piece of the
puzzle that his basketball career has become. Someday, he's
certain, that puzzle will be pieced together and he'll have an NBA
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity to represent the country and go over
there and get a gold medal,'' Sasser said Thursday. ``But it's also
a career move for me. We're coached by two great NBA coaches and a
great college coach. There's a lot of eyes on you in a situation
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich, the Lakers' Del Harris and the University of
Illinois' Lon Kruger are running this U.S. team, but coaches always
talk to other coaches when evaluating talent, and word of Sasser's
play for the U.S. team will spread.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected Sasser will start when the U.S. team takes on
France in the first exhibition for the Americans on Saturday. The
Federation Internationale de Basketball Association World
Championship of Basketball starts July 29 in Athens, Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Sasser hopes to parlay this experience into an NBA tryout with a
team that is the right fit for him because he would prefer not to
have another season like the last two, not that there's anything
wrong with the CBA, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CBA is the second-best basketball in the world because
guys down there are trying to get a 10-day (NBA contract),'' Sasser
said. ``You're not trying to get a one-year (contract). You're just
worrying about getting a 10-day. It's a real competitive league.
You don't have the real quality 7-footers. That's about the only
difference between it and the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that and the paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, Sasser said he expects to weigh his European
options after the tournament to see if it makes sense to return
overseas to play next season, especially because the NBA lockout
could extend through the early portion of the season. He said he
had a bad experience with Europe when he came out of college, and
only after spending six weeks last season with Caja San Fernando in
Spain did Sasser begin to accept Europe as a basketball-playing
option.
</P>
<P>
   ``My agent and I made a decision when I was a rookie to test the
waters overseas,'' Sasser said. ``I went to Italy to see how it
was, and I really wasn't ready for that move. So I went to the CBA
and got Rookie of the Year. I felt like I had a great CBA season
with my team and individually. I got two 10-days with San Antonio
and one with Dallas. That made me actually happy to come back to
the CBA again the following year (last season) and felt like I was
going to go up early with an NBA team and would stick there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I didn't get a call-up, even though I was
leading the CBA in scoring. I went to Spain for a month and a half
this year, and I enjoyed it. I think it's something I could do as a
career move this year if I have to. As far as me, I would make more
there than the NBA minimum because of the taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's nothing like the NBA. It's a dream league. It's
the best basketball in the world, and there's so many people
striving to make it there and stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Sasser is on the verge of being one of those who
make it. And his play for the U.S. team in the next 3{ weeks could
be the steppingstone that puts him over the top. &QL;

REPUBLICANS PUT OFF EFFORT TO OVERTURN ORDER ON GAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small group of conservative Republicans postponed
their effort Thursday to reverse a presidential order prohibiting
discrimination against gays in the federal work force.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, directed by Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colo., and backed by
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Irving, and Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, R-Sugar Land, was postponed out of concern that it would be
embarrassing to Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona, the only openly gay
Republican in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe chairs the committee that approved a treasury and postal
spending bill that the Republican leaders wanted to use as a
vehicle to carry an amendment overriding Clinton's
anti-discrimination order.
</P>
<P>
   Hefley said he would try to attach his amendment to another
spending bill next week, one that Kolbe has no authority over.
</P>
<P>
   Armey told reporters that he plans to continue his support for
the Hefley amendment, not because of his own views on gays but
because of what he called ``the excessive and abusive use'' of
executive orders by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe that a responsible Congress can allow a
president to govern by fiat,'' Armey said in an interview with
Texas reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Armey acknowledged that he does not believe that any
group of citizens should afforded a special protection based on
what he called ``a behavioral issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My own personal feeling is that we have civil rights
legislation that protects people from discrimination,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   Hefley's amendment, according to some Republican aides, grew out
of a so-called ``values summit'' in May sponsored by DeLay in which
Christian conservative leaders won a promise from GOP House leaders
to support their ``family values agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Republicans led by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
of Mississippi have labeled homosexuality a sin and blocked the
nomination of the openly gay James Hormel as ambassador to
Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Christian conservatives have placed ads in newspapers
imploring gay people to renounce their homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe warned his Republican colleagues Thursday that if they
persisted with their assault on gays, they could alienate a
substantial bloc of voters in November. He called the Hefley
amendment, not to mention the anti-gay rhetoric from his party
leaders, ``a bad signal'' for the GOP to be sending.

   NEW YORK _ Everybody into the pool!
</P>
<P>
   The fairy-tale-pretty ponds in the ravishing country called
Illyria, which has materialized at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at
Lincoln Center, aren't just there for scenic purposes. People get
wet in the English director Nicholas Hytner's spirited new
production of ``Twelfth Night.'' Some jump into the water; some
fall in, and others merely get splashed.
</P>
<P>
   Now you could get all academic and argue that such incidents
correspond to the elemental imagery in the play, the greatest of
Shakespeare's romantic comedies, what with all those references to
the transforming powers of the sea and Elysian streamt's occurring
isly as much burlesque-comic as cosmc, an occasiools and dunked
amers s to strutf.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Center has cwith a seductive, classier alternathe r-age
comedieaditionally flood movie theaters in July and August. This
`lfth Night, or What You Will,'' which op asenter Festival '98, is
never less than an appetizing eyeful, thanks largely to the work of
the great designer Bob Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, in capturing what one character describes as the
``midsummer madness'' of the play, the production is ofted, plgags
aed in cleasiblet even has homovie-hose ps guaranteed toz: Paul
Rudd Kyra Sedgwick an the the crossiola, this r's Oscar Best
unt.yable as mucof this `ht'' iting it to come togher in ways it
never does, and thore eavmayitsimb set, a sensualist's delight of a
dreamscape that hovers between Venice and Marrakech and makes
astonishing use of eye-fooling perspective, sets up expectations
for a ``Twelfth Night'' of surpassing wit and sophistication. It
promises, alas, more than much of the cast can deliver.
</P>
<P>
   The romantic leads, with the qualified exception of Ms.
Sedgwick, rarely suggest depths of character. They execute their
comic and thematic functions attractively enough. But Ms. Hunt, in
particular, has a two-dimensional flatness that keeps the audience
at a distance. As a consequence, the play's central love story,
which hinges on the complications wrought by mistaken sexual
identity, offers a tidy quota of laughs but little in the way of
emotional nourishment.
</P>
<P>
   For that you'll need to look elsewhere, and not necessarily
where you would expect. ``Twelfth Night,'' as you may recall, tells
the story of what happens when Viola, separated from her twin,
Sebastian (Rick Stear), in a shipwreck, disguises herself as a boy
and becomes the emissary for the Count Orsino ( Rudd), with whom
she has fallen in love, in his wooing of Olivia (Ms. Sedgwick), who
herself falls in love with the man she thinks Viola is.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a subplot that revolves around the ale-soaked,
carousing Sir Toby Belch (Brian Murray), Olivia's parasitic uncle,
and his dim-witted friend, Sir Andrew Aguecheek (Max Wright), and
their run-ins with Olivia's puritanical steward, Malvolio (Philip
Bosco). The ambitious, dislikable and finally pitiable Malvolio has
always been a part to reckon with, portrayed by heavyweights like
Henry Irving and Laurence Olivier, and Bosco does a creditable,
workmanlike job with it.
</P>
<P>
   But the revelations of the production come from Murray and
Wright, who transform the low high jinks of Toby and Andrew into a
blissful vaudeville as rich in psychological detail as it is in
hilarious shtick. If it weren't for Crowley's bedazzling sets, this
Elizabethan Laurel and Hardy would walk away with the show. As it
is, they bring a warm verisimilitude to scenes that are often
treated as throwaway comic relief. In contrast, the primary story
of addled lovers and misdirected passions starts to look like
something that might be titled ``Fast Times at Illyria High.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't necessarily inappropriate to ``Twelfth Night.''
There's definitely a quality of arrested, self-involved adolescence
about Illyria's posturing aristocrats. Orsino, who thinks he wants
nothing more than to marry Olivia, is nEver happier than when
striking attitudes of lovelorn melancholy, while Olivia, in
mourning for her dead brother, revels in the melodrama of
bereavement.
</P>
<P>
   The play's opening images, accordingly, are soaked in an
atmosphere of self-indulgence. Orsino is first seen lolling
languorously and toking on an opium pipe with his courtiers on the
patterned carpeting that covers much of the stage and that has as
its dominant motif a peacock. When he later speaks of ``the
constant image of the creature that is beloved,'' he is not above
staring at his own reflection in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, our first glimpse of Olivia, in a self-conscious
procession of women in exaggerated mourning costumes (the clever
work of Catherine Zuber), establishes her as a pose-striker par
excellence. When she pauses reverentially by a pond, a skull pops
out of the water, in one of the work's many amusing visual
flourishes. Grief, for Olivia, is obviously something of a game.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Viola, who arrives to stunning effect as she wades to shore amid
swirls of mist, is the antidote to this artificiality: sane,
unaffected and emotionally grounded. In some ways, the all-American
Ms. Hunt nicely fills this bill. Her voice, the aural equivalent of
the Great Plains, certainly brims with a common-sensical approach
to life. But hitched to Shakespeare's language, especially the
poetry, it develops a singsong quality that belies her character's
claim that she can speak in ``many sorts of music.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a Viola of lyrical feeling, we get an emotional
efficiency expert, perfectly at ease in men's clothing. ( Stear's
Sebastian, by the way, both looks and sounds remarkably like Ms.
Hunt's Viola.) This works fine when she's skeptically summing up
the convolutions of the plot, and Ms. Hunt has some charming
business when Viola is forced into a sword fight.
</P>
<P>
   But in contrast to the subtle sensuality she generated in her
Oscar-winning role in ``As Good as It Gets,'' she seems not so much
sexually ambiguous as sexually disinterested, even when Viola (in
the guise of Orsino's page, Cesario) has to undress her employer
for a swim.
</P>
<P>
   This absence of chemistry robs the play of any erotic danger,
though not for want of directorial effort: Hytner has Viola's hands
straying to Orsino's hips when he kisses her on the brow and Ms.
Sedgwick's Olivia wrestling Violq-Cesario to the ground while
kissing her/him full on the mouth. But the scenes feel spurious
somehow; what you feel you're watching is actors carrying out a
director's instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd, the comely star of the film ``The Object of My
Affection,'' directed by Hytner, has a good time posing as an
eternally bare-chested poseur. But it's a one-note, if exuberantly
realized, performance that doesn't let Orsino grow from false love
into the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sedgwick is potentially a first-rate Olivia; she has the
requisite glamour and a confident grasp of the comedy's language
that lets her play inventively with line readings. She is
ill-served, however, by Hytner's direction, which has Olivia shed
her dignity in her first speaking scene and never reclaim it. As
she progresses through a series of increasingly revealing outfits,
in hopes of capturing Cesario's attention, she registers as the
sort of hungry man trap found in old slapstick routines.
</P>
<P>
   Murray and Wright certainly understand slapstick. Hytner has
steered them through some delicious physical comedy, in which they
are ably assisted by the more straightforward performances of Amy
Hill as Maria, Olivia's crafty lady-in-waiting, and Skip Sudduth as
their friend Fabian. But Murray and Wright also create the kind of
complete portraits that allow you to imagine the lives their
characters lead when they aren't onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Murray locates a chilling, class-conscious viciousness in Toby,
never so evident as when he drunkenly sputters at Malvolio,
``Aren't thou any more than a steward?'' And you're always aware of
the ravages of age and alcohol; this Toby is first kin to Falstaff.
Wright's Andrew Aguecheek, of the stuttering speech and fluttery
footwork, provides a beautifully assured picture of a
heartbreakingly tentative soul, a stupid man who can never be more
than an imitative echo of others.
</P>
<P>
   Without ever ceasing to be funny, these actors elicit the
subliminal sadness and anxiety in ``Twelfth Night,'' even more than
this production's Malvolio, who becomes the victim of a practical
joke pushed too far, and the clear-eyed philosophizing clown, Feste
(David Patrick Kelly), who anticipates Lear's fool.
</P>
<P>
   Bosco, a fine actor, is more than adequate, but his character
seldom transcends the role of disapproving foil and easy target for
the others, bringing to mind Gale Gordon's curmudgeonly boss in
``The Lucy Show'' on television. Kelly is an unusually low-key,
close-to-invisible Feste, a sort of Depression-era folk hobo type,
whose songs, set to music by the talented Jeanine Tesori (the
composer of the musical ``Violet''), are bizarrely reminiscent of
James Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twelfth Night'' also features an appealing on-stage band,
directed by Kimberly Grigsby. In addition to indulging the musical
requests of the moody Orsino and Olivia, whose funeral obsequies
are given haunting voice by the counter-tenor Marshall Coid, the
musicians strike astral chords to suggest the ordering,
otherworldly providence at work in ``Twelfth Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tesori's music here is fantastical and wonder-struck, a
fitting accent to the exquisite visual pipe dreams conjured by
Crowley's set and Natasha Katz's lighting. It's unfortunate that
the characters onstage don't always measure up to the ethereal
charms of the land they inhabit. But this Illyria _ a place, after
all, of much mirth and beguiling spectacle _ remains an inviting
oasis for theatergoers in search of escape from Manhattan in its
dog days, and their own midsummer madness.
</P>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ Ian Schrager sat at the head of a stark
white table in a stark white room. Dressed in khaki pants and a
collarless white shirt, he was surrounded by men in crisp dark
suits talking in the most minute detail about this hotel _ the
Delano, his intimate Art Deco property whose room rates are Miami's
highest.
</P>
<P>
   Why, Schrager wanted to know, were housekeepers turning down
only 35 rooms a shift, instead of 50 or 55? And how was the mix of
fashion, walk-in and group business holding up?
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, during a fast-paced tour of the hotel, Schrager
turned up a maddening stain on the bottom of the swimming pool _
one of the hottest social scenes in Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Fix it, he said to hotel's general manager before boarding a
Gulfstream jet to return to New York. Over the next week, he would
fly to London to inspect two other hotels he was developing, debate
acquiring a property in Chicago and reopen the St. Moritz hotel,
the frayed dowager on Manhattan's Central Park South that he hopes
to turn into superluxury lodging and the flagship for his company.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five months, Schrager, the former operator of the
Studio 54 discotheque _ and, as a result, a convicted felon who had
a hard time borrowing the money to buy his first hotel, a fleabag,
in 1983 _ has multiplied the number of hotels he owns to 16 from
six. He has also found a powerful Wall Street partner, enabling his
company to become the largest hotel owner in New York. And last
week, he signed contracts to buy the 1,000-room St. Giles Circus
hotel in London and the 110-room Hotel de la Tremoille in Paris.
And within the next three years, he wants to quadruple the size of
his billion-dollar company.
</P>
<P>
   But if Schrager, who turns 52 July 19, was once a rebel _
defying industry conventions with hotels in bad locations that
combined stylized, closet-sized rooms with glamorous patrons and
head-turning lobbies, bars and restaurants _ the ``boutique'' niche
he brought to life is now being stalked by every large hotel chain
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton, Sheraton and their ilk are all hurrying to build quirky
hotels for baby boomers who are tired of the sameness of their
childhood Holiday Inns. And the rush is coming as the industry,
notorious for its cycles of boom and bust, appears to be in the
midst of another episode of frenzied overbuilding.
</P>
<P>
   Schrager, who nearly lost his heavily leveraged hotel empire
during the last industry downturn, in the early 1990s, says he is
better capitalized than in the past _ and more nimble and more hip
than his rivals. He, not they, Schrager says, is best able to
replicate the success of hotels like his Royalton, whose lobby and
restaurant on Manhattan's West 44th Street remain the places to be
seen for the black-clad executives of the advertising, fashion and
magazine industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every city could use a boutique hotel that takes it up
a notch,'' said Schrager, looking over his steel-framed reading
glasses. ``In a place like Indiana you couldn't do a Royalton, but
you could do a hotel that's better than the generic cookie-cutter
ones that are out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrager's hotels can never be described as cookie-cutter. The
dark wood lobby that sweeps back to the airy Blue Door restaurant
at the 208-room Delano, for example, bears little resemblance to
the 2,000 yards of sheer white curtains and 40-foot mahogany doors
that dominate the lobby of the 245-room Mondrian in West Los
Angeles _ even though the two hotels had the same designer,
Philippe Starck. At both, the guest rooms, with their custom
furniture, have an elegant simplicity, which may help guests forget
the close quarters. But the emphasis is on the public areas _ the
lobbies, restaurants and bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he could be successful at the Mondrian,'' said
David Geffen, the Los Angeles media billionaire who is an old
friend of Schrager's. ``But he turned it into a major addition to
L.A. He knows how to make people feel that they're staying at an
exciting place.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrager's office at the Paramount, his 591-room hotel on West
46th Street in Manhattan, is characteristically black and white,
with family photographs scattered amongst magazine and newspaper
articles that testify to his obsession with the elusive
intersection of pop culture, fashion and commerce: ``How Cars Lost
Their Character,'' ``Fantasy Decor Isn't Just for Amusement Parks
Anymore'' and ``How the Gap Inc. Spells Revenge.'' Indeed, the Gap,
along with Nike, serves as a corporate model for him; both
companies have stayed ahead of the fashion curve while appealing to
audiences that cross class lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up in a mass-market economy,'' Schrager said.
``Sameness was a virtue. Holiday Inn used to say the best surprise
is no surprise. But I think my generation wants to see something
new and innovative, stylish. We brought an entertainment approach
to hotels that makes it more than just a place to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrager, who lives with his wife, Rita Narona, and two young
daughters in a $9 million apartment on Central Park West, has gone
to great lengths to assure that sleeping is the last thing his
guests think about. Before settling on a design for the ``water
salon'' at the Delano, he papered his entire office with
photographs of swimming pools torn from magazines. Before choosing
the appropriate uniform for workers at the Whiskey Bar in the
Paramount, he had models don 100 different outfits.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, Ian is selling a certain amount of sex
appeal, which is probably the same notion he was selling 20 years
ago at Studio 54,'' said Jonathan Tisch, president of Loews Hotels.
``Ian has really changed the hotel industry by showing us what
design, excitement and hype can do for what has been a very staid
business.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   These days, ever conscious of his image, Schrager emphasizes the
profitability of his enterprise. Last year, he said, the six of his
hotels that were open for guests turned $59.5 million in operating
income on $148.7 million in revenue from rooms _ a 40 percent
profit margin that analysts say puts Schrager in the top tier of
hoteliers. Revenue per available room, a standard measure of
financial health, runs about 6.6 percent above the industry average
for the Paramount and a whopping 40 percent at the smaller
Royalton.
</P>
<P>
   Setting the stage for the rapid expansion he plans, Schrager
formed a partnership in March with the Northstar Capital Investment
Corp., a real estate investment firm in New York, and consolidated
his hotel properties into a single company, Ian Schrager Hotels.
Northstar, which is becoming a publicly traded real estate
investment trust, has an 84 percent stake in the company, but
Schrager runs the hotels with little interference. He is chasing
more deals in Paris and Berlin and plans to sell shares overseas
this fall in his company's hotel venture in Europe with Burford
Ltd., a real estate company based in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets more rate for his product than other hoteliers because
of his style, clientele and the image thing,'' said Arthur Adler,
lodging director at Sonnenblick Goldman, a real estate investment
bank in New York. ``With Starck and the custom-made furniture, he
has higher development costs, but he makes up for it with higher
occupancy. Overall he's extremely cost efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrager said his current strategy had three prongs: to buy up
to five hotels a year, to roll out one of his New York hotels as a
brand in other cities and to develop a line of boutique hotels for
one of the lodging giants. According to hotel executives, Schrager
has had talks with Bass Hotels and Resorts, which operates or
franchises the Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn chains. More recently,
industry analysts say, he resumed negotiations with Barry
Sternlicht, chairman of Starwood Hotels and Resorts _ which, as the
owner of such brands as Sheraton and Westin, is the largest hotel
company in the world _ about creating a hotel brand for Starwood.
Starwood officials did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something that's just a specialized niche,''
Schrager said of his style of hotel development. ``It's got
mainstream appeal that people respond to.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industry experts disagree. ``He's still playing the
margins,'' said Stephen Rushmore, president of HVS International, a
hotel consulting firm in Mineola, N.Y. ``He's going after the
entertainment set, actors, models, designers. I'm not sure that
market is deep enough to fill all those rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   One hotelier who says he does not see the appeal of Schrager's
approach is Donald Trump.
</P>
<P>
   ``He puts linoleum in the bathrooms and gets people to pay a
high price,'' Trump said. ``I've always liked using marble.'' For
Schrager's sake, he adde, ``I hope the public never tires of
linoleum.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Schrager'3 bid to become an international hotelier comes as the
specter of overbuilding is again haunting the hotel industry.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, up to almost 165,000 new rooms are expected
to open this year, one of the highest volumes ever, according to
Paine Webber Lodging Research. It is as if many hoteliers have
forgotten the lessons from the great hotel bust of the early 1990s,
when the industry teetered under the weight of empty rooms and
hefty debts. Even the mighty Marriott Corp. had to reorganize into
two separate companies; Marriott International now expects to add
150,000 new rooms by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But hotel occupancy rates are already dropping in cities like
Atlanta, Dallas and Phoenix _ places that only a few years ago were
described as hot real estate markets. Analysts take some solace in
the fact that fewer new rooms are planned at the high end of the
market. Investors, however, have found no such comfort, sending
hotel stocks down about 10 percent this year, on average, even as
the overall stock market has continued to climb.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, its seems as if every hotel company wants a line of
boutique hotels, a field that Schrager once had to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Nussbaum, chairman of Patriot American Hospitality, which
owns Interstate Hotels and Wyndham, has said he plans to bring his
recently acquired Malmaison boutique chain to New York, Boston,
Chicago and Los Angeles from Britain. William Kimpton, whose
boutique hotels feature the restaurants of Wolfgang Puck and other
celebrity chefs, is pushing his collection of trendy hotels
eastward from San Francisco and wants to double it in size by 2002.
In April, Starwood _ which had tried to buy Schrager's company last
year _ converted the old Doral on Park Avenue into the W New York.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say a smaller company like Schrager's will find it
difficult to compete with the huge advertising budgets and
reservations systems of a giant like Starwood. But, they add,
Schrager retains an entrepreneurial edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big corporations will find it more difficult to duplicate
t(e creativity of small, boutique properties,'' said Jason Ader, a
lodging analyst with Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schrager is spreading his entrepreneurship well beyond
his three original hotels in New York. He is now operating eight
hotels, including the Clift in San Francisco and the recently
acquired Barbizon and Empire in Manhattan. At the same time, he is
developing eight others: three in London, one in Paris, the Miramar
in Montecito, Calif., and three others in New York, including the
St. Moritz, which he snatched away from Trump.
</P>
<P>
   For Schrager, of course, the risk is that he may become the kind
of cookie-cutter hotelier he once abhorred.

   Wisdom answers his mail:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Wisdom: Isn't it awful about Prosecutor Kenneth Starr
demanding that the president's Secret Service detail testify about
the president's private activities? Doesn't this mean that our
presidents would be permanently surrounded by police spies?
</P>
<P>
   (Signed) Walter T.
</P>
<P>
   Dear T.: So what's wrong with that? It could lead to great
things: every member of Congress surrounded by police spies, for
example. But not to worry. Once the Secret Service is licensed to
police presidents, what's to stop a president from throwing them
all out onto the lawn and bringing in his own private bodyguards?
Gangsters do it. Why not the chief?
</P>
<P>
   Yrs truly, Wisdom
</P>
<P>
   Dear Wisdom: I've been thinking about these HMOs. What right do
they have to make doctors get approval from insurance agents before
an insured patient like me can get proper treatment?
</P>
<P>
   (Signed) Jennifer W.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Ms. W.: What are you kicking about? If you weren't so
self-centered you'd be asking why there's no health insurance of
any kind for millions and millions of suffering people.
</P>
<P>
   At least you've got something to complain about. So the
insurance sharks turn off your X-rays. Big deal! Be grateful the
insurance business is letting you have anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   Yrs impatiently, Wisdom
</P>
<P>
   Dear Wisdom: I don't see why so many schools openly encourage
unmarried teen-agers to take condoms when they go out on dates.
Shouldn't they, instead, be warning the kids that fooling around
could prevent them from growing up to be president?
</P>
<P>
   (Signed) Ignace P.
</P>
<P>
   Dear P.: So can AIDS, you knucklehead.
</P>
<P>
   Yrs in exasperation, Wisdom
</P>
<P>
   Dear Wisdom: Don't you think that the country would be much
happier, not to mention nobler, if we restricted ourselves to
presidents who have never engaged in premarital sex or even the
kind of adultery so popular nowadays?
</P>
<P>
   (Signed) Bruce M.
</P>
<P>
   Dear M.: You are suggesting that Americans will only tolerate
presidents who are out of touch with the nation's sexual norms.
This is silly. All the country cares about is legality.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Congress has never codified what is legal
and illegal, sexually speaking, for a president.
</P>
<P>
   Write your congressman. Tell him we need a law stating clearly
not only what youthful sexual experience will bar people from the
highest office, but also what sexual behavior, if any, will be
legally permitted while he serves.
</P>
<P>
   Yrs creatively, Wisdom
</P>
<P>
   Dear Wisdom: I am an old-fashioned TV watcher who still turns to
the network news every night, hoping that Brinkley, or Huntley or
Cronkite will be making a comeback. Not that it's likely, I know.
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow, I notice that almost every night half of each network
show is devoted to a story about some amazing new medical discovery
that will make it possible for everybody to just go right on living
and living. My question is this: Why is there never any news at all
from the world outside Washington and medical laboratories?
</P>
<P>
   (Signed) Mrs. Thelma C.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Mrs. C.: I take it from your letter that you are no longer
26 years old. From this it follows that what you watch is of no
interest whatever to television programmers, none of whom is older
than 27, and all of whom have the taste of 14-to-25- year-olds,
which is the age that interests their advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The glut of happy medical news exists for two reasons:
</P>
<P>
   (1) It is much cheaper to produce than it is to have
correspondents reporting from Singapore, New Delhi, Brisbane,
Johannesburg, Ankara, Caracas or even Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   (2) By promising immortality, it encourages people like you to
keep buying the patent medicines whose ads, promoting ways to
survive the nightmare of being over 30, keep TV news in business.

   Cheerlessly yrs, Wisdom

THALIDOMIDE IS APPROVED FOR U.S. USE, WITH STRICT SAFEGUARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thalidomide, a sedative whose use produced
thousands of babies with flipperlike limbs and other deformities,
was approved for use in the United States for the first time
Thursday, nearly four decades after it was stripped from pharmacy
shelves around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Food and Drug Administration marked a major
reversal for the agency, which rejected thalidomide in 1960 as it
was being promoted worldwide as a harmless cure for morning
sickness. That initial rejection spared countless American infants,
and sealed the FDA's reputation as the finest consumer safety
authority in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 38 years later, thalidomide is showing promise for
maladies as diverse as AIDS, blindness and cancer and autoimmune
disease. Technically, the FDA has approved it to treat a
complication of leprosy, but the majority of prescriptions are
expected to be written for ``off-label'' uses, particularly the
severe mouth ulcers and wasting that occur in the late stages of
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is monumental,'' said Dr. Norman Fost, professor of
pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin who has been a close
observer of the thalidomide controversy. ``It is one of the most
interesting and important drugs that the FDA has ever and will ever
be asked to approve.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA first announced its intention to approve thalidomide
last September. But it took 10 months for the government _ working
with Celgene Corp., of Warren, N.J., which manufactures the drug _
to iron out a complex distribution plan that is intended to prevent
future birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting system will make thalidomide the most strictly
regulated medicine in the nation's history. Pharmacists will be
required to register with Celgene to dispense the drug, and doctors
must register to prescribe it. Patients must fill out detailed
surveys that will be submitted to a team of Boston University
researchers who will track the use of thalidomide.
</P>
<P>
   Women of childbearing age who want to take thalidomide will be
required to use two forms of birth control. They will undergo
weekly pregnancy tests in the first month, during which time
prescriptions will be filled for seven days at at time. In
subsequent months, pregnancy tests will be conducted and
prescriptions filled every 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more rigorous than anything I am aware of in the
world,'' said Dr. Allen Mitchell, director of the Slone
Epidemiology Unit at the Boston University School of Public Health,
which will run the thalidomide monitoring system. ``Perhaps it is a
certain kind of symmetry that the agency that made its reputation
by prohibiting thalidomide might make it again by developing a
system that makes it available with minimum risk.''
</P>
<P>
   For Celgene, a tiny biotechnology company that has never before
brought a drug to market, Friday's approval was the culmination of
five years of work. Bruce Williams, the company's director of
marketing, said the drug could reach pharmacy shelves in four to
six weeks. The drug will not be cheap; Williams estimated it would
cost patients an average of $12 a day, but said it would likely be
used for only several months at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the approval, Williams sounded at once elated and
nervous. ``We are somewhat sobered by the fact that now, all the
responsibility that we know we are taking on is real,'' he said.
``Even with that, this feels great. It's been a long haul.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But for the original victims of thalidomide, who over the past
several years have reluctantly accepted that the drug was making a
comeback, Friday was no cause for celebration. Of the estimated
12,000 thalidomide babies, about 5,000 survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're somber,'' said Randy Warren, the founder of the
Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada. Warren, 36, was born
with deformed hands and stumps for legs and after his mother took
just two teaspoonfuls of the drug early in her pregnancy. ``We
remember all the people that were lost. Today is a day of
remembrance for us, and a hope that history doesn't repeat
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   In designing the plan to prevent birth defects, FDA officials
had to strike a delicate balance that would weigh safety against
the prospect that severe restrictions would drive the drug
underground. Indeed, it was a black market trade of thalidomide,
which was being imported from Brazil and sold over the Internet
several years ago, that prompted the FDA to consider approving the
drug in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to strike a balance between regulation and
over-regulation,'' said Dr. Debra Birnkrant, deputy director of the
FDA's Division of Antiviral Products. ``We do this feeling
comfortable that we have a strong safety monitoring program and
that the data support the safety and efficacy of this product.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of whether, or if, more deformed babies will be born
has been a contentious one. While both Celgene and FDA officials
say they believe they can achieve their goal of no new birth
defects, others, including Warren and Fost, are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly not achievable,'' Fost said. ``There is
nothing in the world that has zero risk. Not water, not air, not
cars, not anything. The question is what are reasonable measures to
come as close to that goal as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Should birth defects _ the agency calls them ``adverse events''
_ occur, Dr. Birnkrant said the FDA and Celgene would investigate.
If it turns out that a doctor or pharmacist is refusing to comply
with the rules of the distribution system, their privileges to
prescribe or dispense the drug might be revoked.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts expect doctors to react cautiously to Friday's
approval, in part because they fear lawsuits and in part because of
the cumbersome bureaucracy that goes along with prescribing it.
Celegene's Williams predicted that fewer than 10,000 patients would
use thalidomide in its first year on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Originally manufactured by a German company, thalidomide was
banned from drug stores in 1962 but never disappeared from use. In
the mid-1960s, an Israeli doctor gave it to leprosy patients who
had trouble sleeping. To his surprise, their skin lesions cleared
up almost overnight.
</P>
<P>
   By 1975, the U.S. Public Health Service had set up a special
``compassionate use'' program to distribute thalidomide to patients
who suffered erythema nodosum leprosum, or ENL, a complication of
leprosy that causes skin lesions, fever and other symptoms. By the
late 1980s, Brazil and Mexico had approved thalidomide for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1991, Gilla Kaplan, a scientist at Rockefeller
University, discovered that thalidomide helps regulate the immune
response by suppressing a crucial protein called tumor necrosis
factor alpha. She teamed up with Celgene, whose scientists began
investigating the drug's use for AIDS. Other companies began
investigating thalidomide for other ailments, including brain
cancer and macular degeneration, which causes blindness.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, after reports that drug buyers' clubs in New
York and San Francisco had been purchasing thalidomide illegally in
Brazil and distributing it to AIDS patients, the FDA issued
invitations to Celgene and the other companies to submit
applications to market thalidomide.
</P>
<P>
   As the lengthy approval process got underway, Warren and his
fellow ''thalidomiders'' found themselves in the uncomfortable
position of consulting with Celgene in an effort to insure that the
drug was kept out of the hands of women who are or might become
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   He described himself and the other victims as ''the unwilling
watchdogs of this process,'' adding: ``We alone ask the question:
Is the world ready for another generation of thalidomiders?''

SEC CHARGES BAY STATERS IN ALLEGED INTERNET SECURITIES SCAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Federal securities regulators Thursday charged two
Massachusetts brokers with being part of a nationwide ring that
peddled fake securities over the Internet and bilked investors of
$7.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in a complaint
filed in US District Court that Anthony Garry, of Beverly, and
Thomas Connolly, of Wilmington, played key roles in selling phony
certificates of deposit to clients enticed by the promise of high
returns.
</P>
<P>
   The fake investments were part of an international Ponzi scheme
originating in suburban Chicago that shuttled money between dozens
of accounts in the United States and overseas, regulators alleged.
In a Ponzi scheme, early investors in a scam are paid with money
that comes from later investors, who typically lose their money.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint, Michael D. Richmond, of Orland Park,
Ill., invented and ran the scheme, advertising various investments
in Royal Meridian National Bank, which he claimed was an
international private bank in the South Pacific. He said the
institution is a ``fully chartered'' bank with offices in
Vancouver, the Bahamas, Guernsey, and Turks &AMP; Caicos.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the bank is ``a shell'' with no offices and no revenues,
regulators allege.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond set up an Internet site late last year advertising bank
investments, including certificates of deposit with little or no
risk and ``great yield'' and money market accounts of up to 24
percent, the complaint alleges. The site instructed investors to
fill out an investment application and courier checks to an office
in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond also employed a network of agents _ including Garry and
Connolly _ through Liberty Network, a financial planning school
Richmond ran, the complaint alleges. Garry sold at least $500,000
in certificates of deposit in Massachusetts, and Connolly sold the
investments despite warnings from his firm.
</P>
<P>
   About 185 investors in 14 states, including Massachusetts,
bought the phony investments, the complaint alleges. Regulators
said they have been able to trace just $2.7 million of the money
invested. At least $4 million was used by Richmond and his
employees, the complaint contends. Richmond spent $72,000 to lease
a car, used $2,500 for a boat, $895 for a ring and spent $18,000 on
home improvements, regulators alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond, 49, previously was sanctioned by the state of Illinois
in 1991 for selling unregistered securities, according to the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Also named in the complaint are K. Bruce Nuckles, an estate
planner in Virginia Beach, Va., and William Duke, a resident of
Florida who allegedly issued false account statements to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the defendants declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   US District Judge Reginald Lindsay Thursday halted the
defendants' sales and froze their assets. The judge also asked the
defendants to account for investors' money by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Richmond case is one of the biggest Internet fraud claims
filed by the SEC, said Jay Perlman, a senior SEC attorney. &UR;  &LR; In one
of the biggest previous cases alleging Internet securities fraud,
Systems of Excellence Inc. chairman Charles Huttoe pleaded guilty
in January 1997 to defrauding investors of $12 million. He was
sentenced to 46 months in prison.

DAEWOO LEGANZA AND NUBIRA DAEWOO WHO? THE LOW-KEY ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 19)  
 (JT)  
 By JOSEPH SIANO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Daewoo wants to stand out in the traffic jam at the low-price
and family-sedan end of the market, the company's collegial sales
strategy may be its best hope. Its cars, while worth a look, have
no inherent characteristics that set them apart.
</P>
<P>
   The Daewoos' styling sets the tone. Anyone worried about being
the first on the block to own something that might attract too many
stares can buy with confidence. A Daewoo is the road-going version
of the federal witness-protection program. Test drives of the
Leganza and the Nubira brought a few second glances from car-savvy
motorists, but most comments came from attendants at parking
garages and service stations.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean the top-of-the-line Leganza, the compact
Nubira and the subcompact Lanos are ugly _ they might have drawn
more looks if they were. But they are stealth vehicles, which
testifies to how well-proportioned, and derivative, they are. The
Leganza, designed with the help of Giorgetto Giugiaro, the Italian
who created the original Volkswagen Scirocco, blends a few parts
Lexus GS with a smidgeon of Nissan Altima. The Nubira's front end
is vaguely reminiscent of a small BMW.
</P>
<P>
   The name Leganza _ wiseacres are already calling it ``the
lasagna'' _ is a melding of the Italian words elegante and forza
(power). But in trying to build what Daewoo calls an elegant sedan
with a comfortable ride, something was lost in translation.
</P>
<P>
   It is a competent midsize sedan, with comfortable seats (my test
car had six-way power adjustments and manual bolster control) and
room for five people. The handling is secure, with a lot of
predictable understeer, and the four-wheel antilock disk brakes
have good pedal response and produce sure stops.
</P>
<P>
   But Daewoo has miles to go in quietness and ride quality before
the Leganza matches cars like the Honda Accord or Chevrolet Malibu.
Road noise over grooved pavement is a howl; the car's nose
porpoises over uneven surfaces, and road joints are transmitted
harshly to the occupants.
</P>
<P>
   Engine noise from the 16-valve, 131-horsepower in-line four (2.2
liters) intrudes under heavy acceleration. At highway speed,
though, the car could cruise comfortably at 80 or more _ if it
weren't for a disturbing glitch: The engine refused to hold a
steady rev level. Every few seconds, the rpm would dip by about
500, then rise again. In about 700 miles of driving, it never got
worse _ or better. Two other test drivers reported similar
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   The Leganza tries hard to be user-friendly, perhaps its most
endearing trait. The full-size spare was mounted on an exact match
to the other handsome wheels, and the trunk had a CD changer
attached to an upper surface, not the floor. For cargo, the rear
seat folds in a 2-to-1 proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Interior controls were good, with the climate setting adjustable
by degree, but the illuminated graphic on the ventilation takes
some getting used to, with its swirling lines and arrows. The real
puzzler was the premium sound system, with rows of tiny buttons
bearing indecipherable labels. Its graphic equalizer can be
individually tuned or programmed for the type of music (pop, disco,
etc.) and ambience (stage, theater, church), so you can get the
most from that album of disco hymns. Even with all the adjustments,
the sound was lackluster.
</P>
<P>
   And there were some annoying quality lapses. The vanity mirrors
in the visors looked as if they came from a fun house, and the
sunroof shade felt tinny.
</P>
<P>
   The Nubira, the compact sedan that is a step down from the
Leganza, provided the more pleasant driving experience, once its
lower price (starting around $9,000) is factored in. Perhaps
because of its lighter weight, it exhibited less harshness on road
joints. The handling seemed closer to neutral, too, but required a
steady hand in fast cornering. As with the Leganza, the anti-lock
disks produced smooth, steady stops.
</P>
<P>
   Power was adequate, although the 2-liter, 129-horsepower engine
seemed to strain more up hills than you'd think, given that the
much lighter car had nearly as many horsepower. The throttle
problem in the Leganza could also be felt to a lesser extent in the
Nubira. The optional four-speed automatic shifted with creamy
smoothness.
</P>
<P>
   On a long drive, the front seats were comfortable, with six-way
manual adjustment (just spare any backseat passengers an extended
ride). The seatback was the only difficult adjustment, with not
enough clearance between the knob and the door post.
</P>

SERB FORCES SAID TO ABDUCT AND KILL CIVILIANS IN KOSOVO

<TEXT>
<P>
   DECANI, Serbia _ Serbian forces have been turning increasingly
to the abduction and execution of small groups of civilians in
their fight against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo,
according to human rights officials and witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the executions took place moments after Serbian special
police units concluded attacks on villages held by the Kosovo
Liberation Army rebels, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of disappearances are increasing each month,'' said
Behxhet Shala, secretary of the ethnic Albanian Council for Human
Rights. ``There is a mathematical logic to all this. As the Kosovo
Liberation Army kills more police, the police go out and hunt down
civilians who live in the areas where the attacks take place. These
are reprisal killings.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 300 ethnic Albanians are listed by human rights officials
as missing since March, when the conflict intensified between the
rebels and the 50,000 or so Serbian soldiers and policemen deployed
here. Some of them may have fled to Albania or Montenegro and
others may be living with relatives elsewhere in Kosovo. But some
were seen by witnesses being led away by special police units,
never to reappear.
</P>
<P>
   As the war progresses, and as the rebels, who themselves have
abducted at least 30 Serbs, increasingly make Serbian civilians
their target, the fear is growing that the fighting could spiral
into the kind of war against civilians that swept across Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Visits to six of the sites where kidnappings and executions by
Serbian forces are said to have taken place yielded accounts by
witnesses and a look at the bodies of some of the victims. But the
precise number of those executed is difficult to determine.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the accounts of witnesses from each area, it appears
that a total of about 100 ethnic Albanians, most of them men of
fighting age, have been rounded up and shot, usually in groups of
fewer than a dozen, in the last five months.
</P>
<P>
   One man, Ndue Biblekaj, said he witnessed abductions and
executions by members of the notorious Serbian ``black hat'' unit,
which was employed in Bosnia to kill Muslims and Croats and expel
them from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were massacres in the village of Drenoc and Vokshit near
Decani,'' he said in an interview in rebel-held territory. ``I saw
a black hat unit line up 13 civilians and shoot them. They stripped
the bodies of their clothes, slashed the arms and legs with their
knives and dug out their eyes. They used an excavator to dig a pit
and bury the bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never forget this sight,'' he said. ``There were other
executions that included women, children and the elderly. You could
see the bodies, including one group of 15 people, lined up by the
side of road.''
</P>
<P>
   The detained men were often marched in single file by the
black-uniformed Interior Ministry commando unit to the local water
treatment plant, which was used as a command center, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Biblekaj, an ethnic Albanian, served for eight years in the
police force in the border village of Junik. He was part of the
Serbian force that recaptured Decani from the rebels in June. The
Serbs shelled the town, reducing whole sections to rubble. They
sent in tanks and armored personnel carriers, blasting holes in the
walls of houses and driving nearly the entire population over the
mountains into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Decani is now abandoned, and the Serbian police, who crouch
behind sandbagged positions in the ruins, come under frequent fire
from rebel units.
</P>
<P>
   Biblekaj has deserted the police to join the rebel movement. He
changed sides after the attack on Decani, because, he said, he was
appalled by the killing there.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated attempts to inspect two sites suspected of being mass
graves in a wooded area near the deserted and badly damaged town,
still the scene of frequent armed clashes, were thwarted by special
commando police units.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Kosovo, Veljko Odalovic, a Serb in a province
that is 90 percent ethnic Albanian, denied that the police had
executed anyone. Serbian officials, as a matter of policy, refuse
to disclose the names or location of those taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   Not every ethnic Albanian who is picked up by the police
disappears permanently, but the fear of being seized has become
common in these villages. Many are those picked up return after a
few days, complaining of beatings and other ill treatment at the
hands of the police.
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses, the largest number of killings occurred
in the villages of Likosane and Cirez at the end of February, in
the village of Prekaz in the first week of March, in the village of
Poklek at he start of May, in Ljubenic at the end of May and in
Decani in June.
</P>
<P>
   On May 30, special police units entered Poklek and ordered most
of the residents into a house owned by Shait Qorri.
</P>
<P>
   Fazli Berisha, who was outside the village hiding behind a wall,
said he saw 60 or 70 women and children ordered out of the house as
Serbian forces burned neighboring homes. The women were told to
walk across a field to Vasiljevo, a neighboring village, he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Hajirz Hajdini and Mahmut Berisha were brought out moments
later and told to walk in the opposite direction,'' he said,
referring to two men. ``As they walked away they were shot by the
police. Sefer Qorri, 10 minutes later, was brought out of the house
and told to walk in this direction. He was shot in about the same
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The villagers said they later found the body of Ardian Deliu, a
17-year-old youth, near Vasileva, about two miles away, but they
said nine men remain missing.
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, Fred Abrahams, a researcher at Human Rights Watch,
spoke with Zahrije Podrimcaku, who witnessed the attack on Poklek.
An hour after speaking with Abrahams, who is compiling a report on
human rights violations, she was arrested by Serbian police
officers in Pristina, the provincial capital. She was charged a
week later with involvement in terrorist activity. She remains in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Poklek is part of the silent no man's land that lies between the
Serbs and the rebels, who control about 40 percent of the province.
Broken glass litters the main street. The deserted stucco homes and
small shops have been looted, with household items strewn over
yards and left in broken heaps. A pack of mangy dogs snarl from
behind the blackened shell of a house, and the stench of a dead
farm animal rises from an untended hayfield.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road in the town of Glogovac the residents seem to move
in fear down the dirt streets, which are periodically the targets
of Serbian snipers. A farmer, Ali Dibrani, 54, was shot dead
recently as he walked home at dusk with his niece.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian authorities, who have issued a written order to
block food and commercial goods to all but state-run shops in
Kosovo, have effectively cut supplies to Glogovac and nearby
rebel-held areas. The shortages have left people bartering for
liter-size plastic bottles filled with gas. The clinic has run out
of medicine, and processed food, like cooking oil, is scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, abductions have left their mark. Dr. Hafir Shala, 49,
an ethnic Albanian who worked in a clinic run by Mother Teresa's
Sisters of Charity mission in Glogovac, was seized by the Serbian
police on April 10.
</P>
<P>
   Shala, who was jailed for four years for separatist activity
during Yugoslavia's period of Communist rule, was pulled from a car
at a police checkpoint on the road to Pristina and put in a black
jeep with three plainclothes police officers. One officer got into
a gray Volkswagen Passat with two of Shala's companions. The two
vehicles were driven to the central police station in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three of us were taken to separate rooms on the third
floor,'' said Shaban Neziri, 49, who was traveling with the doctor,
as he sat in the remains of an unfinished house in the village. ``I
was interrogated for six hours and then told I could leave. When I
was escorted out of the room and down the hall I heard horrible
screaming. It was Dr. Shala. I stopped. I asked the policeman what
was happening to Dr. Shala. He pushed me forward, saying, `Go, go,
go.'''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor never returned. His father, Isuf Shala, 63, went to
the police headquarters the next day, but was turned away at the
door.

   ``I saw the police after a few days and they said Hafir was not
on the list of prisoners,'' he said, seated cross-legged in his
home. ``They said he had never been in police custody. The police
said maybe our soldiers had taken him, perhaps I should check with
them.''

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
SOUTHPORT, England _ If Nick Price should win the 1998 British Open
this week at Royal Birkdale, he will have his near miss at last
month's U.S. Open to thank.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took Price's fourth-place finish at the Olympic Club for him
to realize that the reason he hasn't won is not his golf swing but
his putting stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem I've had over the last six months is that
I have not putted solidly,'' Price said. ``I have not putted badly.
But I've not been making the bonus putts, like a couple of the ones
I made today, the 15-to-20-foot range. Sometimes, it takes
something like the U.S. Open to give me a good kick in the backside
and go and practice my putting more.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was exactly what Price did, and the results showed in
Thursday's first round. Price shot a 4-under-par 66 and was only
one shot behind co-leaders John Huston and Tiger Woods. Four of his
birdie putts Thursday were from 12 feet or longer, including a
22-footer on No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I changed putters right after the Open,'' Price said. ``I've
gone back to a face-balanced putter. I've always putted best with a
face-balanced putter or mallet-type putter. My game from tee to
green has been solid for, I feel like, the last 2{ years. If I
could just get to putt like I did from that spell from 1992 through
1994, I probably would have won a couple of tournaments this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've been playing for seventh, eighth, ninth places,
because the club has been in the bag for show, just making up the
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Price the world came to know in the early to mid-1990s
finished first far more often than seventh or eighth. He won twice
in 1991 and 1992, including the 1992 PGA Championship. Then, he won
four times in 1993 and five times in 1994, picking up his second
PGA Championship title.
</P>
<P>
   Price finished No. 1 on the PGA Tour money list in 1993 and '94,
earning player-of-the-year honors both years.
</P>
<P>
   But as the demands on his time grew and his life became hectic
and hurried, Price's game began to slide. He didn't win again until
the 1997 MCI Classic. In the past 18 months, however, Price has
slowly returned to top form. This week, a number of players picked
him as one of the golfers to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The return of his game has come hand-in-hand with the return of
peace to his private life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got all my priorities in order a couple of years ago,''
Price said, ``and life has been an absolute pleasure the last year
and a half. I still have the desire, which I think is the thing
that's the key. I enjoy going out and practicing and playing. I
still love playing the game. But it's been frustrating because my
putting has not kept me at the strength I was playing at in the
early 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to change that, Price went home after the U.S. Open
and headed to the putting green. He spent a couple of hours a day
for 10 days grinding it out with his new putter. And finally, Price
believes his efforts are paying off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting is a psychological thing,'' Price said. ``My biggest
problem has always been starting the ball on line. I feel with this
putter, I start the ball on line and I can be more focused on the
speed. It's such a fickle thing. It's like a science, a game within
a game.''
</P>
<P>
   So Price has high hopes for the rest of the tournament. He would
love to return to the spotlight with another major victory, but if
it is not meant to be, that is fine with Price as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, when you've got kids and a family, it's not the
be-all and end-all when you don't play that well,'' Price said.
``Especially your kids. My kids have no idea what I do. My kids are
too young to really understand. They still think Greg Norman is a
better golfer than I am.''

AEROSMITH DRUMMER RECOVERING FROM BURNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The investigation into the cause of a car fire that injured
Aerosmith drummer Joey Kramer Wednesday night focused Thursday on a
pool of gasoline that witnesses saw beneath the car before the
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer, 46, suffered second-degree burns on his left arm and
minor burns on his legs. He was pulled from his burning 1998
Ferrari by an attendant at a gasoline station in Scituate, Mass.
Kramer was sitting in the driver's seat when the flames engulfed
the car.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer, who was released after treatment at hospital, could not
be reached for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, which produced flames that reached 15 feet, destroyed
the car and damaged a gasoline pump.
</P>
<P>
   The gasoline may have leaked from a ruptured fuel line or a
faulty gasoline pump, said fire officials. The tip of the nozzle of
the gasoline hose snapped off inside the fuel tank of Kramer's
Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the station, Gerald Gorman, said the pump was in
good condition and that it had serviced ``thousands'' of cars
without incident.
</P>
<P>
   The fumes from the pool of gasoline may have been ignited by the
intense, 1,500-degree heat generated by the car's catalytic
converters, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the car was running while the gasoline tank
was being filled, which is illegal and increases the chance of
fire. The engine in the Ferrari is in the middle of the car, near
the gasoline tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the fuel line had lost its integrity and the product
leaking out of the fuel line puddled underneath the car and came in
contact with hot engine parts, there is the potential of fire,''
said Scituate Deputy Fire Chief Charles Curran.
</P>
<P>
   Making sure that a motorist shuts off his car engine while
fueling is the reponsibility of a gasoline station owner. Gorman
said he did not know whether the Ferrari's engine was running.
</P>
<P>
   An Aerosmith spokeswoman in New York said Kramer is resting at
his home in Marshfield Hills, Mass. with his wife, April. An
Aerosmith tour scheduled for later this summer will go forward as
scheduled.

 &HT;    Woods, Huston lead British
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ Not one to miss out on good scoring
conditions, even in a major championship where frequently he's been
outmuscled by the heather and hay, Tiger Woods shot to the top of
the British Open leaderboard Thursday at Royal Birkdale, taking a
share of the first-round lead at 5-under-par 65 with fellow
American John Huston.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to last year at Royal Troon, Woods went from big
numbers to low numbers. He hit irons or 3-wood off tees and hit
fairways. He managed his game. Considered by some observers to have
vanished from golf's mainstream except for a win in Atlanta two
months ago, Woods jumped back into the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased,'' Woods said. ``I played very well today,
made a lot of good putts, drove the ball very well. Consequently, I
was able to control my spin on the greens because I was in a lot of
fairways.''
</P>
<P>
   Huston, who has been sleeping on magnets to ease shoulder and
back pain, eagled the 17th hole and birdied the 18th on a day when
the winds died down significantly and the temperatures warmed.
After three cold days with winds that once reached gusts of 55 mph,
Thursday was by comparison a day at Palm Springs, with 27 players
under par. If you drove the ball straight and missed the rough, it
provided the groundwork for a low score.
</P>
<P>
   One shot back at 66 are Americans Fred Couples and Loren Roberts
and Nick Price of Zimbabwe. At 67, two shots off the lead, are
Americans Davis Love III of Sea Island and Brad Faxon, Australian
Robert Allenby, Vijay Singh of Fiji and Sweden's Fredrik Jacobson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have predicted about 10 over winning if every day was
like Monday,'' Huston said. ``(Conditions) have gradually got a
little easier every day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly didn't expect the weather to be like this
(Thursday),'' said Couples, ``so I don't know what it's going to be
like (Friday). Maybe it will be back to normal where a 72 or 73
will be a good score.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone took advantage of the conditions. Defending
champion Justin Leonard, Scotland's Colin Montgomerie and five-time
champion Tom Watson settled for 3-over 73s. Georgia Tech's Matt
Kuchar, the U.S. Amateur champion, managed a 75 _ six shots higher
than Spain's superb amateur, Sergio Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Goergia Tech was prominent on the leaderboard elsewhere. David
Duval, who leads the PGA Tour money list, shot an even-par 70,
along with Columbus' Larry Mize. Atlanta's Stewart Cink opened with
a 71 to match England's Lee Westwood, a local betting favorite
along with Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Tightening up his sometimes suspect putting, Woods turned in
4-under 30 with birdie putts ranging from 6 to 20 feet and slipped
only a bit. He missed a 3-footer on the 12th for bogey and then
smacked an 8-iron over at the 18th for a bogey that cost him the
sole lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think last year I made a couple of mistakes,'' Woods said,
``and I went for too much instead of playing a little safe. ...
It's just learning how to play golf.''

   Kuchar's status, play still amateur
</P>
<P>
   By Furman Bisher
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England -- Seemingly, it is such a matter for
discussion that a rather large choir of press nobility gathered by
the first tee at an alarmingly early hour of the morning to watch
Matt Kuchar strike his first shot in the British Open. Matt Kuchar,
amateur champion of the United States, had become quite a magnet
for attention since landing at Royal Birkdale, bordered on one side
by the Irish Sea, on another by a suburb of this blue-collar resort
town.
</P>
<P>
   Would he turn professional, would he continue the carefree life
of college at Georgia Tech, playing the game for fun, leaving all
that endorsement money lying on the table?
</P>
<P>
   The sky was low and blackening when he was introduced, playing
with old Sam Torrance of Scotland and Stuart Appleby, the
Australian Adonis who reminds you of a blond Frank Stranahan.
Kuchar chose an iron and pulled the tee shot into hay. British
galleries have a sense of timing, and they applaud only when the
shot merits it, and so sat silent. He would bogey the hole, and
this would sort of set the tone for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Old dad, Peter Kuchar, was on the bag as usual. ``I like having
my dad caddie for me,'' Matt said. ``We have a good time
together.'' This time the caddie was less animated than at the U.S.
Open, where the brass called him in and asked him to cool it. So
when Matt rolled in a 35-foot putt for birdie, Peter merely grinned
broadly and gave a little fist thrust.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Matt did little to incite histrionics.
</P>
<P>
   Two holes pretty much established his round. He was back to even
par after the birdie on fourth hole when disaster struck. The fifth
is a big swinging dogleg right, and in an attempt to cut the
corner, Kuchar was a bit short, but the lie in the mild rough was
not bad. His second shot, though, flew like a rocket, onto and over
the green under the low-hanging limbs of a pine. He made a
misguided effort to slash it out and failed. A second swing
advanced the ball a few feet, and in the end he had to sink a
downhill putt from 12 feet to save double bogey.
</P>
<P>
   At the 13th, his drive was one of the rare ones that split the
fairway. He hit his approach to 20 feet, and here he takes over.
``I walk up thinking birdie and walk off with a bogey.'' He
three-putted, the mortal sin of golf. Now he was 4 over par and it
wouldn't get any better. He made a remarkable recovery from a
pothole bunker to save par at the 12th, a lovely par 3. He was the
master of the up-and-down several other times, but when he came to
the 17th, a 547-yard par 5 inviting birdie with a trailing wind, he
found the rough again, then a bunker and bogeyed.
</P>
<P>
   So, at the end of his first round of British Open golf, his 75
was six strokes behind the leading amateur, Sergio Garcia, the
Spaniard who won the British Amateur. It had been a round that
frustrates, ``Not the pressure,'' he said. ``I was ready for the
pressure. It was all the fairways missed. I was driving so poorly,
and I'm working on my fourth driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, we approach the maddening issue of to pro or not to pro.
There is a pile of endorsements out there should he make the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very marketable. Highly marketable,'' said Bev Norwood of IMG.
``On marketability, he's ready. As for his game, I'm not so sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kuchars, pere et fils, are approaching crisis time. Does he
defend his U.S. Amateur title and risk not winning again, and
losing market appeal? Does he turn after the Palmer Cup and get on
with it? Or does he go back to school for his degree and a chance
at winning a national collegiate championship? Or, would you risk
making the turn with a game not yet mature enough and the prospect
of being another wealthy Marty Fleckman? That is, being quite
wealthy but no game to back it up, without the pride of
achievement?
</P>
<P>
   Based on finishes in the professional tournaments he has played
this year, six from the Masters to Loch Lomond, he would have
earned about $105,000. Not much for a pro's life. The pressure now
is not only on his game, but on the decision. Time after time, both
Matt and Peter have been forced to give the same answer:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not thinking about that right now. We have no idea yet
what's going to happen. Right now,'' says Matt, ``I just want to
enjoy my first British Open.''

   SOUTHPORT, England _ In howling conditions earlier in the week
when balls were either struck low into the wind or simply struck
down, Nick Price loomed an even bigger favorite to contend in the
127th British Open. While others quaked at the thought of 72 holes
around Royal Birkdale in such windshirt-whipping madness, Price
merely shrugged on the practice range as he bored another long iron
into the dark sky.
</P>
<P>
   Wind? What wind?
</P>
<P>
   ``A gentle zephyr,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   With calm conditions and warmer temperatures bringing more
players into the field Thursday, Price's solid ball-striking still
put him among the elite. Shooting a 4-under-par 66 in the first
round, Price positioned himself a stroke off the pace set by Tiger
Woods and John Huston.
</P>
<P>
   It was Price's best round in the British Open since he won at
Turnberry in 1994. That he missed just two greens seemed nothing
unusual. That he missed very few opportunities while on the greens
explained the 66. Everyone knows that if Nick Price's putting had
been anything close to his ball striking in recent years, more than
three majors would be on his bio by now.
</P>
<P>
   ``My game from tee to green has been solid for the last two and
a half years,'' Price said Thursday. ``If I could just get to putt
like I did from that spell from, '92 to '94 (when he won two PGA
Championships and a British), I probably have won a few more
tournaments this year.''
</P>
<P>
   A few more days like Thursday and Price might even secure more
respect around his Hobe Sound, Florida, home.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids have no idea what I do,'' said Price. ``My kids are
too young to understand. They still think Greg Norman is a better
golfer than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Price was kidding there. His putter was no joke. All the hard
work the good-natured Zimbabwean has done with his flatstick lately
has started to pay off. To those amateur players who can not spare
15 minutes on the putting green, consider that Price has been there
16-18 hours over the past two weeks. Three hours at a stretch
sometimes. In south Florida summer heat, it's less taxing than
hitting balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest problem has always been starting the ball on
line,'' said Price, who switched to a ``face balance'' mallet
putter after a fourth-place finish at the U.S. Open. ``I feel with
this putter I start the ball more on line and I can be more focused
with the speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Price's confidence with the putter approached what he feels
while standing over a 2-iron to a tightly-guarded green, he likely
would not have finished five shots behind Lee Janzen. Hitting 49
greens in regulation at Olympic (second), he wasted the performance
with a tie for 48th in putting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I putt well, I have a good chance to win,'' Price said.
``For me, my ball striking has always been a standard. I guess it's
just a question of how sharp my short game is. Sometimes it just
takes something like the U.S Open to give me a good kick in the
backside to go and practice my putting more.''
</P>
<P>
   Price's threesome was the place to be for red numbers Thursday.
He played with Woods, the co-leader, and saw the difference in his
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He managed his game,'' Price said. ``To me, it looked like he
throttled back a little bit today, which is good to see. ... If he
continues to get better and better, by the time he's 30, he's going
to be a pretty good player.''

 &HT;    Love cure may be time off
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ While it's unlikely many players will copy
Davis Love III's fractured preparation for the British Open, so
far, it's working. The evidence Thursday was a 3-under-par 67 at
Royal Birkdale that allowed the Sea Island PGA champion to stand
two shots off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days ago, it didn't appear that Love could make a
plane, let alone a leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   He came to the year's third major having missed the cut at the
U.S. Open, partially because of back problems. Idle on the PGA Tour
since then, Love didn't begin hitting balls until last Wednesday.
Then, planning to fly to England Monday, he forgot his plane and
passport, drove back to Sea Island from Jacksonville and came over
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   But Love quickly adapted. He played a strong practice round
Wednesday despite his tender back and even hit balls afterward.
Thursday the 67 tied his low career round at the British Open. He
turned in even-par 34, birdied the par-4 11th with a 7-iron to four
feet, then birdied 15 and 16. He missed a chance for three straight
at the par-5 17th, which was downwind and delightful, by hitting a
5-iron through the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy to be playing and getting off to a good
start,'' Love said. ``I hit a few wayward drives, but I didn't
panic and was very patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Love's back is getting any attention needed. Columbus, Ga.,
physical therapist Tom Boers is on site, also treating Fred Couples
(66) and Ernie Els (72).
</P>
<P>
   Lehman guts out a 71
</P>
<P>
   After straining his right shoulder Tuesday night and doubting at
the time that he could play, 1996 champion Tom Lehman managed to
hold together for a 1-over-par 71. Lehman injured the shoulder with
his kids at the Southport Fun Fair while on a barrel ride that
required supporting both hands and feet. But after several sessions
Wednesday at the fitness trailer and two hours of hitting balls
before his mid-afternoon round, Lehman improved enough to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started warming up today, I thought there was no way I
could play,'' Lehman said. ``I could not lift my arm after it
happened.'' He did not make the decision to play until 45 minutes
before his tee time. ``My swing plane was not quite right, but I
manufactured a swing,'' he said. ``I earned my right to play and I
wasn't going to give it up when I had a fair chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar misses opportunity
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech's Matt Kuchar started out Thursday morning with
calm conditions and milder temperatures and knew the obvious. It
was a day when 5-over-75 became nearly unacceptable. ``You really
feel you have to take advantage when it's like this,'' said the
20-year-old amateur. ``It's a little disappointing.'' Kuchar said
he was relaxed starting out, but found his stomach churning a few
holes into the round. ``About the fourth hole I was thinking, 'Man,
this (major championship) golf stuff is such a different feeling,''
he said. ``It's so much different than regular golf.'' ...
Scotland's Colin Montgomerie struggled to a 73 after starting
2-under through six holes, troubled by pulled hooks. Until this
year, he's been a fader. ``The fade has gone and now I hook the
ball,'' he said. ``I'm afraid that in a right-to-left wind, you're
lost.'' ... Defending champion Justin Leonard said his 73 was
especially disappointing ``because I know this is probably as easy
as the golf course will play all week.'' ... Britain's chief hope
to end the Americans' three-year win streak, Lee Westwood, said he
was not distracted by a cellular phone that rang during his swing,
but, ``I don't know why people bring them to the course. If you
need a telephone on the course, you're too busy and you should be
in the office.''

 &HT;    Ellis, Pittman slotted as starters at defensive end
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas -- It might be an overstatement when defensive
coordinator Dave Campo says every position is up for grabs, but
there are some big holes to fill in his defense. In the past two
seasons the Cowboys have lost three key defensive ends _ Charles
Haley, Tony Tolbert and Shante Carver.
</P>
<P>
   When the season opens Sept. 6, rookie Greg Ellis and seldom-used
defensive end Kavika Pittman will be starters. At least that's what
the depth chart lists this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion is that Kavika is an outstanding athlete who really
came around at the end of last year,'' Campo said of the third-year
player from McNeese State. ``He's a combination of a linebacker and
defensive end, someone who can rush the passer and drop back into
coverage. (Ellis) is good at rushing the passer and stopping the
run. At 285 pounds, I think he's going to develop into quite an
overall player.''
</P>
<P>
   The other positions seemingly up for grabs are middle linebacker
and free safety. Veteran Fred Strickland will start in the middle
in the early part of camp, but Randall Godfrey, who played outside
linebacker last year, is expected to challenge for the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Campo declined to talk about the position battle, saying,
``Right now Fred Strickland is our middle linebacker.''
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer George Teague is expected to be the leader at free
safety, a position vacated when Brock Marion went to Miami. Also
trying out for the position are Charlie Williams, Kenny Wheaton and
Omar Stoutmire.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders is probably the only player in Dallas who can
create a scene without trying. Although the injured cornerback will
not practice for about a week, he drew a crowd when he drove up in
his customized golf cart. Many spectators tried to get his
attention, but Sanders declined comment. The only sound from his
vehicle came from his stereo.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders attended the afternoon workout and ran sprints. The
ankle surgery he had in the spring has not hurt his speed.
</P>
<P>
   Quote of the day
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chan Gailey, speaking about the excitement the Cowboys
have brought to Wichita Falls: ``I hate to say I don't pay
attention to things like that. But if one person shows up or 10,000
show up, we've got a job to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Did you know?
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bates, who retired Wednesday to become a full-time coach
with the Cowboys, is tied with Ed Jones and Mark Tuinei for most
years of service to the football team. All three played 15 years in
Dallas. Jones, however, holds the team record for most games played
_ 224. Bates finished with 217.
</P>
<P>
   Bates said a handful of NFL teams were interested in signing
him, but was not interested. ``I couldn't play for a team other
than the Cowboys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Name recognition
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Bates, his addition to the coaching staff has caused
one problem. The team already has a defensive assistant named
Bates.
</P>
<P>
   Line coach Jim Bates is one of the team's most vocal leaders.
When asked about the new man on the staff, he smiled and said,
``Bill's my cousin. You can call us Bates and Bates.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bates had a better idea: ``You can just call me Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Critic's corner
</P>
<P>
   Larry Weisman of USA Today predicts the Cowboys will go 7-9 this
season: ``This is not the NFC East old geezers will remember. The
Cowboys have made a lot of changes in personnel and with the
system. Alterations like that are not easily assimilated.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Former All-Pro safety Mel Renfro will sign autographs at a local
department store today. ... More than 240 press credentials have
been issued for training camp. ... The Cowboys started camp earlier
than most NFL teams because they play five preseason games instead
of four. ... The Cowboys will practice in pads for the first time
during today's 4 p.m. workout.

DOCTORS STAND WITH CLINTON ON MANAGED-CARE OVERHAUL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four years ago, doctors were on the front lines
helping Republicans kill President Clinton's complicated plan to
overhaul the health-care system.
</P>
<P>
   But times have changed, and so have alliances. On Thursday when
Democrats rallied on Capitol Hill to push their plan to regulate
managed care, the man who introduced Clinton was Dr. Randolph
Smoak, chairman of the American Medical Association, the nation's
largest doctors' organization.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest health-care battle, the powerful physicians' group
has thrown its support behind Democratic efforts to rein in managed
care and has criticized Republican leaders for offering what it
considers ineffectual and half-baked plans.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors, who plan to descend on Capitol Hill next week to
lobby their lawmakers, are also angry that Republican legislation
does not give people the right to sue their HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who the day before had met with people unhappy with
their managed care plans, has called for a bipartisan effort to
solve the problem and has refrained from sharp attacks on the
Republican proposals.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Democratic rally, he couldn't resist pointing out
some political irony in the doctors' support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried for years to talk them out of it, but most doctors
are still Republican,'' the president told his audience of
lawmakers and medical professionals.
</P>
<P>
   While the AMA is a nonpartisan organization, its political arm
awarded Republican lawmakers two-thirds of the more than $400,000
in contributions it has made in the most recent election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Smoak said he could not agree with the president's assessment
that most doctors belong to the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But the South Carolina physician said he was disappointed that
the congressional leadership has been slow to recognize the problem
with managed care and has only recently issued proposals on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not put out a piece of legislation that we have been
able to read,'' Smoak said. ``They have put out some things that
give a skeleton. But then the devil's in the details.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Senate and the House GOP leadership have unveiled
health care plans that would provide appeals process for some
consumers in managed care plans and give patients easier access to
emergency rooms and gynecologists.
</P>
<P>
   But neither of the GOP plans would allow patients to sue their
HMOs or provide access to specialists other than gynecologists and
pediatricians. Those elements are included in Democratic plans.
</P>
<P>
   Smoak said the right to sue is a ``critical'' element of any
managed-care plan, arguing that it is unfair that many patients can
sue their doctors but not their health-care plans.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican lawmakers have agreed with insurance companies
and business groups that giving people the right to sue would drive
up health-care costs and reward trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trying not to be outdone by the Democrats, House Republicans
staged their own health care event in front of the emergency room
of the George Washington University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   But divisions within the Republican ranks have become evident,
as two GOP lawmakers showed up at the Democratic event earlier in
the day, including Rep. Greg Ganske of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Ganske, a physician, announced that he was resigning from a
national panel on Medicare because fellow Republicans were angry at
his support of Democratic managed-care plans.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Republican lawmakers are also under pressure from the
state's doctors who want Congress to make it clear that the state
has the right to give consumers the ability to sue their health
care plans.
</P>
<P>
   One source said that House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Sugar
Land, has been wavering on the legislation because of the
objections of local doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston, who supports the right to sue, said
that ``it's going to be awkward'' for the Republicans in the
state's congressional delegation because, members of the Texas
Medical Association are ``typically Republican and have been
supporters of Tom DeLay and Bill Archer.''
</P>
<P>
   House Ways and Means Chairman Archer, R-Houston, supports the
House GOP managed care legislation, an aide said.

SPORTS COLUMN: `MORE MORE' GALLERIES FOLLOW PAK 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GLF-JAL) 
(JT) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. _ During the hazy, humid morning, the legions
following Se Ri Pak up and down and across Wykagyl Country Club's
hills had increased from about 200 on the first tee to maybe 500,
and now, as golf's latest wonder woman strode up the ninth fairway,
an Asian man pointed to another 500 spectators framing the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Galleries more more more,'' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   And on the back nine in Thursday's opening round of the JAL Big
Apple Classic, the galleries were even more more more, growing to
maybe 2,000. Mostly they were people of Asian backgrounds _ men,
women, teen-agers and children _ but there were many white and
black men, women, teen-agers and children.
</P>
<P>
   Some were there to see the others in Pak's threesome _ Nancy
Lopez, still the queen of women's golf, and Hiromi Kobayashi, the
Japanese pro who won this tournament in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But all were there to see Se Ri (pronounced Se-REE) Pak, the
20-year-old South Korean rookie pro. Over five days last week she
won the United States Women's Open in a 20-hole playoff and then
shot a round of 61, a record for the Ladies Professional Golf
Association tour, en route to winning the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic
near Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   Pak didn't play at that level Thursday, shooting a one-over-par
72, eight strokes behind the leader, Penny Hammel. But golf's like
that. The game is too elusive to let the same golfer win every
week, as Tiger Woods has discovered for all his talent and all the
commotion he created in winning the 1997 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   With Pak's sudden and stunning success, she is naturally being
thought of now as the Tigress of the women's tour, a prodigy who is
winning major titles at a younger age than Tiger did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Se Ri's following the same path as Tiger,'' said Lopez, who
shot 68. ``But she shouldn't be compared to anybody. She's great
already. She's going to set records. She just has to be herself.''
</P>
<P>
   For Pak, being herself has been enough. As an amateur in South
Korea, she won 30 tournaments. Turning pro at 18, she played in 14
tournaments in Korea, winning six and finishing second in seven.
Early last year she moved to Orlando, Fla., for tutoring by David
Leadbetter, the celebrated guru to many PGA Tour pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a presence about her,'' Leadbetter was saying over the
phone from the British Open. ``She had heard of Nancy Lopez, but
she didn't know much else about the women's tour. But it was her
and her family's wish to come over here and play the women's tour
to fulfill her goal of being the best in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Like everybody else who sees the 5-foot-6-inch Pak for the first
time, Leadbetter noticed her sturdy legs, the foundation of her
power off the tee. As a youngster in South Korea, she developed
those legs as a track-and-field athlete, winning medals in a rare
combination of events, the hurdles and the shot put.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she arrived,'' Leadbetter said, ``I'd never seen such a
potentially good player for such a young player.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Leadbetter knew she needed some tweaking to her swing
and to her posture when addressing the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like many Asian golfers, she was too bent over, but now she's
more upright,'' he said. ``She also took the club inside and looped
it, so we firmed that up. Now she's swinging on a much simpler
plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Pak had yet to qualify for the LPGA Tour, she finished
tied for 21st in last year's Women's Open at Pumpkin Ridge in
Cornelius, Ore., as Lopez finished second to England's Alison
Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see the potential was there,'' Leadbetter said.
``The ambition was there too. She once told me, `If I come back in
this world, I want to come back as a man and be the best player on
the men's tour.'''
</P>
<P>
   Having won another women's major, the McDonald's LPGA
Championship in Wilmington, Del., along with the Women's Open and
her record 61, Pak is arguably the world golfer of the year so far,
male or female.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her goal this year was to win five tournaments, which I
thought was pretty ambitious for a rookie,'' Leadbetter said. ``But
she's already won three. Like she says, `I have no nervous.' ''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But whether Se Ri Pak, who tees off with Lopez and Kobayashi
Friday at 12:30 p.m., wins or loses at Wykagyl this weekend, she's
the attraction. And no matter what she shoots, the galleries will
be more more more.

DAN FOGELBERG KEEPS ON DELIGHTING FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM ROGALSKI  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been 19 years since a 28-year-old Dan Fogelberg earned
immortality with his No. 2 hit single ``Longer,'' which has been
used at more weddings than a polka band.
</P>
<P>
   The man with the sensitive, introspective lyrics and satin voice
hasn't had a Top 30 hit since 1982 when ``Make Love Stay'' and
``Missing You'' were released on his smash Greatest Hits album,
which went triple platinum.
</P>
<P>
   The album capped a string of eight consecutive album that went
either gold or platinum. But the years since have not been as
successfuly. The singer's last four albums have failed to reach the
benchmark of 500,000 copies sold.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of mega-hits through most of the 1980s and
1990s, Fogelberg _ a fit and boyish-looking 47 and still as
feverishly private as ever _ has maintained a huge and loyal
following of fans, some of whom travel in caravans for up to 10
hours or more to see his concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Fogelberg has stated several times that when he reaches the age
of 50, he will ``take a long, hard look at my career and decide if
I want to keep doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   That has created a bit of a feeding frenzy among his most loyal
fans, who will go to great lengths to see his shows and try to
learn about him before he literally sails off into the sunset on
one of his many boats.
</P>
<P>
   Fogelberg said in a telephone interview that he wants to explore
his painting and sailing talents when he finally retires from the
music industry.
</P>
<P>
   On his current tour, which raps up July 25 in Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., Fogelberg is promoting the album ``Portrait,'' which
chronicles songs from all 15 of his album. It also includes five
never-before-released songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got another studio album in me,'' said the singer, who is
on the second leg of his summer tour. ``I don't know when I'm going
to get to it, but there's no hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   No hurry, he said, because he's currently working on a Christmas
album for 1999 release, as well as a live album from last summer's
acoustic tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not your traditional Christmas album,'' he said. It will
explore his Celtic roots, he explained, using traditional Scottish
instruments like lutes, as well as his guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two will keep me pretty busy up to 2000, probably,'' he
said. ``At that point I'll look at making another studio album and
say, `Is this the last one or do I want to keep doing this?'''
</P>
<P>
   It is the thought of a final Fogelberg album that has fans like
Susan Wilcox, 31, of Warensburg, Mo., scrambling to see as much of
the singer as possible.
</P>
<P>
   She discovered Fogelberg when she was 13 years old and has been
a dedicated fan ever since. In early July she travelled 11 hours on
a train to catch his concert in Chicago, knowing that there are an
ever-dwindling number of opportunities to see him perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``His music is so totally different from anyone else. It's
intelligent. It's introspective. It's beautiful,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Fogelberg said it's that type of connection with his fans that
has helped keep him going all these years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When songs reach people in a much deeper way than just
commercial, it's very gratifying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But having such an ability to touch people with his lyrics has
been a double-edged sword for Fogelberg, who is also is an
accomplished guitarist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest frustration of my career has been that I've done
all my own guitar playing over the years and don't get recognized
for it,'' he said. ``People come to my shows and say, `I had no
idea you played lead guitar.'''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason fans enjoy Fogelberg, his popularity shows
no signs of fading into the past.
</P>
<P>
   There are numerous active Fogelberg Web pages on the Internet
with message boards and chat rooms where fans share their kinship
and discuss anything Fogelberg related, from contemplating the
meaning of his lyrics to mourning the day he chooses to hang up his
guitar for other pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Connelly runs one of the most active Fogelberg message
boards out of his Wilmington, N.C. home. He says the board receives
an average of 50 posts per day from people, some from as far away
as Australia and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just love his music,'' Connelly said in a phone interview.
``His lyrics are so enlightening and have a philosophical impact on
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Fogelberg is not packing them into 20,000-seat stadiums
like he used to, he is having little trouble filling smaller venues
of up to 5,000 seats or more.
</P>
<P>
   After the July 25 show in Fort Lauderdale, it's back to his
Colorado ranch where he'll continue working on the Christmas and
live albums in his private studio, and sailing whenever he can at
his summer home in Maine.

NEWSPAPER, REPORTER UNDER FIRE ON CHIQUITA STORY 
</HEADLINE>
 (With CHIQUITA-ENQUIRER.) 
(nk) 
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Robert Olson, general counsel at Chiquita Brands
International, suspected someone was tampering with his voice mail
on May 1 when he checked for messages and kept getting busy
signals. The system operator quickly discovered an intrusion from
outside the building, but it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, The Cincinnati Enquirer published an 18-page
section of articles criticizing the business practices of Chiquita,
the world's largest banana company. Peppered throughout the
articles, and seeming to confirm many serious accusations, were
quotations from the confidential voice-mail messages of senior
executives and top lawyers at the company, which had been recorded
secretly and systematically over the past seven months. The
articles asserted the quotations were from 2,000 recordings leaked
by a company official, not an uncommon way for reporters to get
information.
</P>
<P>
   But Chiquita says there is no person with authority over its
voice mail system. Within days, their own electronic sleuthing
convinced executives that the lead reporter for The Enquirer
articles, Mike Gallagher, had himself invaded the system and
tape-recorded hundreds of messages.
</P>
<P>
   On June 28, in a shattering retreat, the city's dominant
newspaper dismissed Gallagher, accused him of stealing the
voice-mail messages, and agreed to pay Chiquita more than $10
million and publish a front-page apology on three separate days
repudiating the entire series.
</P>
<P>
   On July 2, Chiquita filed a defamation suit against Gallagher in
federal court here.
</P>
<P>
   Even as intriguing new details of the case emerged in interviews
this week, many mysteries remained. One is whether the suit was
settled because the newspaper questioned the accuracy of the
articles or because the voice mail messages were stolen by its
reporter. What is also unclear is how, if he did steal the
information, Gallagher, 40, got the code words for so many voice
mailboxes and whether he had inside help.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and a local special prosecutor are investigating whether
laws covering privacy of electronic communications and wiretapping
were violated, said Sheri Farrar, the FBI agent in charge of the
Cincinnati bureau. Even though people involved in the investigation
said that calls into Chiquita's voice mail system had been traced
to Gallagher's desk and pay phones near his office and home,
prosecutors could face difficulty proving that he made the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher has not commented publicly on the matter since he was
dismissed. He did not respond to telephone messages and written
messages left at his home this week; his lawyer, Patrick Hanley,
did not return telephone calls. A ``for sale'' sign was posted in
the front yard of the suburban home he shares with his wife and two
young daughters. Friends said it went up the day after Gallagher
lost his job.
</P>
<P>
   The furor over The Enquirer's renunciation of its year-long
investigation and the ensuing criminal investigation has unsettled
employees at the newspaper and the apparent divisions spilled into
public when Chiquita filed its suit against Gallagher.
</P>
<P>
   A letter on Enquirer stationary attached to the suit asserted
that the articles were prepared outside the newspaper's normal
checks and balances and were the result of Editor Lawrence
Beaupre's zeal to win a Pulitzer Prize for the paper. The letter
was undated and the signature was removed, although the writer said
he or she is a newsroom editor at the paper. The letter was sent to
a local radio talk show host and later provided to Chiquita,
company executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted that Pulitzer so bad that he lost perspective,''
said the writer. ``He trusted Mike. He didn't ask questions. He
didn't listen to the people whom he pays to ask those questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaupre declined to discuss the articles. He became editor of
the Gannett-owned paper in late 1992 after eight years as executive
editor of the company's 10 dailies and two weeklies in Westchester
and Rockland counties.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after his arrival, Beaupre was quoted in Cincinnati
magazine promising to emphasize hard news and enterprise reporting.
Gallagher had worked for Beaupre in Westchester County and came to
The Enquirer in 1995 to beef up the investigative team.
</P>
<P>
   Two people with knowledge of how the Chiquita articles were
handled before publication disputed the letter writer's assertions.
Both people, who spoke on condition that they not be identified,
said the articles had been thoroughly examined by senior editors
and three outside lawyers. They said only a handful of people knew
the specifics of the year-long inquiry because the editors feared a
leak.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two said Beaupre wavered for months on whether to use
the voice mail messages. Gallagher asserted they had been provided
by a source within Chiquita who had authority over the voice mail
system and he urged that they be used. Beaupre was concerned about
the legal ramifications of using material stolen by a Chiquita
employee, the person said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In its suit, the company said evidence showed Gallagher and
unidentified people broke into its voice mail boxes as often as 13
times a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one 10-day period just before the publication of The
Enquirer's special reports, phone and voice mail records show that
Chiquita's voice mail system was invaded on more than 50
occasions,'' the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Warshaw, Chiquita's president, and Olson said evidence
showed that for months Gallagher posed questions to Chiquita
lawyers as he interviewed them for the articles, and then went into
the voice mail system to monitor and record their efforts to get
answers for him.
</P>
<P>
   The suit said three former or current Chiquita employees who
were not identified helped Gallagher gain access to the voice mail
boxes of senior company officials, including Warshaw and Olson, and
provided him with documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he got into the system, he would record the messages from
one person's mail box and then move onto another mail box and
another,'' Warshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Olson and Warshaw said they are not certain whether any current
employees helped Gallagher and that an internal inquiry was
continuing.

PEEPING TOMS HAVE NEW WEAPON IN VIDEO CAMERAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KIMBERLY MARTINEAU  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUILDERLAND, N.Y. _ Peeping toms have a new weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Home video cameras.
</P>
<P>
   No longer confined to window ledges and tree limbs, voyeurs now
stalk their prey at crowded shopping malls, bus stops and airports
with a simple camera stowed in a shopping bag. Edging up to their
victims, they film up skirts and down blouses, largely without
their victims' knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the footage ends up on one of the dozens of Web sites
catering to those who enjoy seeing graphic pictures of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, police have reported a growing number of
these incidents, including such popular places as Disneyland in
California. Last week, Guilderland police questioned a man who was
following women at Crossgates Mall and videotaping up their skirts.
</P>
<P>
   But authorities are often stymied in arresting the amateur
videographers. Without a victim stepping forward to press charges
on invasion of privacy or harrassment, police can't make an arrest.
Because of the nature of the deed, most women strolling through the
mall or riding an escalator have no idea they were targeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have many victims but no faces to go with them,'' said
Guilderland police officer Roger Ginder.
</P>
<P>
   Ginder questioned the 30-something man at Crossgates after a
clerk at Footaction USA noticed the man shadowing a woman while she
was in line. Ginder seized the camera and the footage last Monday,
which included over one hour of taping, with hundreds of different
women from several different malls.
</P>
<P>
   But the man was released without any charges being filed because
they couldn't identify any of the women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems absurd that such a despicable invasion of privacy
would be unenforceable under any current law,'' said Guilderland
police chief James Murley. He said the department is checking with
the Albany County District Attorney and the state Attorney General
to see if any statute exists that could apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy situation,'' said Larry Wiest, the chief
assistant district attorney in Albany County. ``It's hard to find
an identifiable victim. All you're looking at is skirts and
petticoats.''
</P>
<P>
   He said lawmakers need to examine invasion of privacy and
stalking laws in a computer age where hidden cameras, some as small
as a matchbox, abound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the penal law comprehensively addresses
problems of stalking and invasion of privacy...You (should) still
have the right to go to Crossgates Mall and not have someone look
up your skirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Type the word ``peeping camera'' into an Internet search engine
and dozens of web-sites, offering up-skirt and down-shirt views,
appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about that girl going up the escalator at the mall,''
declares one site, followed by crude, descriptive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   There are also Web sites devoted to teaching men how to film
``up-skirt'' or ``down blouse'' without getting caught.
</P>
<P>
   An official with Pyramid Cos. owner of Crossgates, said peeping
cameras at malls and other public places are rare. But he said that
security officials from Pyramid's 17 enclosed malls would discuss
the latest incident at their scheduled meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to provide a safe environment for everyone,'' said
Robert Harrington, director of corporate security at Pyramid Cos.
``This is one more thing on the list to look out for.''

AEROSMITH DRUMMER RECOVERING FROM BURNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KIEHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The investigation into the cause of a car fire that injured
Aerosmith drummer Joey Kramer Wednesday night focused Thursday on a
pool of gasoline that witnesses saw beneath the car before the
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer, 46, suffered second-degree burns on his left arm and
minor burns on his legs. He was pulled from his burning 1998
Ferrari by an attendant at a gasoline station in Scituate, Mass.
Kramer was sitting in the driver's seat when the flames engulfed
the car.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer, who was released after treatment at hospital, could not
be reached for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, which produced flames that reached 15 feet, destroyed
the car and damaged a gasoline pump.
</P>
<P>
   The gasoline may have leaked from a ruptured fuel line or a
faulty gasoline pump, said fire officials. The tip of the nozzle of
the gasoline hose snapped off inside the fuel tank of Kramer's
Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the station, Gerald Gorman, said the pump was in
good condition and that it had serviced ``thousands'' of cars
without incident.
</P>
<P>
   The fumes from the pool of gasoline may have been ignited by the
intense, 1,500-degree heat generated by the car's catalytic
converters, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the car was running while the gasoline tank
was being filled, which is illegal and increases the chance of
fire. The engine in the Ferrari is in the middle of the car, near
the gasoline tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the fuel line had lost its integrity and the product
leaking out of the fuel line puddled underneath the car and came in
contact with hot engine parts, there is the potential of fire,''
said Scituate Deputy Fire Chief Charles Curran.
</P>
<P>
   Making sure that a motorist shuts off his car engine while
fueling is the reponsibility of a gasoline station owner. Gorman
said he did not know whether the Ferrari's engine was running.
</P>
<P>
   An Aerosmith spokeswoman in New York said Kramer is resting at
his home in Marshfield Hills, Mass. with his wife, April. An
Aerosmith tour scheduled for later this summer will go forward as
scheduled.

SAVINGS FROM ELECTRIC DEREGULATION MAY BE MIRAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA VALDEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - We're all supposed to be happy as can be about the
coming of ``electric deregulation.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not.
</P>
<P>
   I see it as the waltz of the Big Dogs and a tedious intrusion
into my measured-to-the-nanosecond schedule.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't ask for this. A regulated monopoly gets the job done
without making undue demands on my time.
</P>
<P>
   Big Business was the impetus for moving electricity generation
from a comfortable monopoly to competition. And they'll get the
gravy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest benefit will be to business,'' says Arizona's
Speaker of the House Jeff Groscost, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   He's an ardent supporter who also sees benefits for consumers
and great opportunities for innovation and technological advances.
</P>
<P>
   I say electricity works fine, and the lower prices may be a
mirage.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: Stranded costs are investments made by utility
companies during regulation that are not expected to pay a good
return under competition. Regulators and utilities think utilities
should be paid for those investments. They don't agree on how much
or whether stockholders or customers should pay.
</P>
<P>
   Under regulation, you and I have always paid for the mistakes of
utility company executives. We just didn't think about it. But
under deregulation, the price we pay for stranded costs might
offset any savings from competition.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what Tim Hogan says. As a member of the board of
the Arizona Consumers Council, he says beware electric deregulators
bearing gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to structure competition so that everybody
wins except us, the small consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Hogan, ``Utilities are saying, `We'll let you all
pay for our uneconomic investments quick so we can get about the
important business of saving you money later on.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But later on may never come.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Corporation Commissioner Renz Jennings says the ``jury
is still out'' on the benefits that will result from what he calls
``re-regulation.'' He says some of those spurring on competition
are motivated by a ``theological belief'' in the market.
</P>
<P>
   I have my own theological beliefs. One of them involves the
value of time. I'd rather spend mine sitting in the back yard
watching birds. Or playing a rousing game of Clue Junior with my
daughter. Or admiring my husband's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt electric de/re-regulation will save me much money. But
it will cost me time.
</P>
<P>
   Think of all those telemarketers calling to speak to ``the
person who makes the electric purchasing decisions in your
household.''
</P>
<P>
   Think of the junk mail.
</P>
<P>
   Think of a day when buying electricity is as tedious as picking
a long-distance provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a busy guy,`` says Jennings. ``I don't care to figure it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen. Life's too short. &QL;

BURIAL OF CZAR DIVIDES RUSSIAN OPINION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Russia will bury a piece of its
turbulent, violent past Friday when the remains of the country's
last imperial ruler, Czar Nicholas II, are finally laid to rest 80
years after he and his family were shot by Bolshevik
revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
   But little remains of the larger, symbolic meaning the Kremlin
was hoping to achieve by finally giving a Christian burial to the
Romanov family and their servants, whose bodies were exhumed from a
Siberian swamp and identified only after the fall of Communism.
</P>
<P>
   What was supposed to close a chapter on an ugly event in
history, the ceremony instead has become another embarrassing
failure of President Boris Yeltsin's efforts to craft a sense of
national identity for the new Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The preparations for the ceremonies have bred the kind of
disruptive and petty squabbles that have consistently bogged the
country down in the post-Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   The event will be boycotted by the leaders of the church that
crowned the Russian czars for 300 years, some of the Romanov
dynasty's descendents, and prominent politicians. Yeltsin himself
had indicated he would miss the funeral, and decided to attend only
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This truth has been concealed for 80 years and we have to tell
this truth tomorrow and I should take part,'' Yeltsin said in a
nationally televised address Thursday. ``This is the right thing to
do from the point of view of human decency.''
</P>
<P>
   But others disagree. Lingering doubts among religious leaders
about whether the remains are genuine, and a larger dispute over
the role the czar's execution should play in Russian history, have
bred the kind of disruptive and petty squabbles over the ceremony
that have consistently bogged the country down in the post-Soviet
era.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's about-face decidely improved the mood among the 62
descendents of the Romanovs and their servants, as the mourners
waited at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo airport for the arrival of the
remains from the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, where the czar's
family was shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are beginning to leave the past behind us,'' Nikolai
Romanov, widely seen as the head of the dynasty, told reporters,
before the nine oak coffins were driven in black hearses to the
church where the imperial family will be laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
   As the procession moved slowly along the Niva River embankment,
studded with flags at half staff and black crepe, crowds of
onlookers craned for a better view of the cortege beyond rows of
police, and helicopters hovered warily overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Then, military pallbearers took the coffins from the vans and
carried them, slowly and stiffly, into the St. Peter and Paul
Cathedral, resting place of all the czars since Peter the Great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting to rest the remains of innocent people who were
murdered, the present generation of Russians is striving to atone
for the sins of their predecessors,'' the Kremlin said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   But far from everyone sees it that way. The Russian Orthodox
church has refused to give the funeral that status of a state
funeral because it doubts the conclusive scientific DNA evidence
that shows the remains as those of the tsar and his family. It has
downgraded it to a funeral of unknown remains, and forbidden senior
clergy _ bishops and higher _ from attending.
</P>
<P>
   Following the church's lead, both houses of parliament have
voted not to send delegations to the funeral of the czar.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, there are doubts about just whom they will be
burying,'' said Yegor Stroyev, speaker of the upper house. ``Second
of all, there can never be repentance on the bones of a man who
destroyed Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's sizeable Communists contingent is staying away in
droves from an event seen as unfairly discrediting the Soviet era.
Ultranationalists who claim that Nicholas II was martyred by an
international conspiracy have demonstrated outside the Peter and
Paul Fortress, bearing such slogans as ``Satanic Regime, Satanic
Ritual,''
</P>
<P>
   Even the czar's ghost is said to have come out against the
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask you not to torment me,'' Petersburg Express quoted
Nicholas II as telling a spiritual medium last month.
</P>
<P>
   Such episodes, apocryphal though they may be, reveal the odd
grip still held over Russian history by a man who was, by most
accounts, a devout family man but a weak and cruel leader, who
violently crushed peaceful demonstrations and led Russia into two
disastrous wars before abdicating in February 1917.
</P>
<P>
   The Romanovs spent the next several months at a palace just
outside St. Petersburg. But the Bolsheviks, locked in a civil war
with troops loyal to Nicholas, then sent him to Yekaterinburg and
executed him and his family on July 17, 1918.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, their daughters Olga,
Tatyana and Anastasia, three servants and the family doctor were
dug up in 1991 from an unmarked grave in a forest near
Yekaterinburg, where their killers had hastily hidden them before
fleeing a Czarist advance. The bodies of two other children _ the
only son, Alexei, and a daughter doctors believe is Maria, were
never found. Most investigators believe the bodies were burned to
ashes.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic experts in Russia, Britain and the United States, using
DNA matching techniques, established there was more than a 99.99
percent chance they were authentic.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Nicholas' funeral also points to a larger problem
that Yeltsin has, for all his desire to leave a legacy as the
father of a new, democratic Russia, never been able to solve: How
should Russia view its Soviet past, as an illegitimate
interruption, or a continuation of the country's 1,000-year
history?
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's other efforts to breach this issue have brought
disappointing results. His promise to open the archives of the KGB
secret police ended with most of the archives being closed for the
next 50 years. His promise to replace the Soviet police state with
a rule-of-law democracy brought free elections, but also rampant
corruption and the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   And now, after decades spent mouldering in a swamp, Russia's
former ruler will be given a Christian burial, but Russia's A-list
is ignoring it. Some people blame Yeltsin, for waiting for the last
minute to champion the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been better if the president had given clear
signals from the start,'' said Viktor Aksyuchits, a government
organizer of the ceremony. ``This is one of the main events of the
20th century in Russia, ... but instead it is being used for
political power struggles.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin toned down what had been planned as a full-fledged
state funeral, earmarking only $833,000 in state funding was
allocated for the burial ceremonies. Russian officials have
defended the stripped-down ceremony, saying that it would be
improper for a country where state workers go months without pay to
spend more, especially at a time when Russia has been forced by its
fiscal woes to accept a $22.6 billion rescue package from
international lenders.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, both Moscow's Mayor Yury Luzhkov and Eduard
Rossel, governor of Yekaterinburg, lobbied hard to have the burial
held on their home turf. Once the decision was made to hold the
ceremony in St. Petersburg, both men declined to attend. Luzhkov,
who has a good chance of one day replacing Yeltsin, now says he
does not think the bones belong to the imperial family.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians agree. A recent national poll said only 47 percent
of Russians believe the czar's remains are genuine. An even smaller
percent of people interviewed Thursday believed that their burial
will amount to anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all a big show for the benefit of the people who set
it up,'' said St. Petersburg student Alexander Dmitriev. ``No more,
no less.''

MARKET PLACE: RECONSIDERING BUYBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., Colo., Nev., Ill.)  (mk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years, share buybacks have been an investor's
best friend. Even though buying back stock may not be the most
inspired use of a company's cash, it has typically sent stock
prices higher.
</P>
<P>
   Some recent announcements, however, suggest that these buybacks
are no longer a layup for investors. With stock prices at record
levels, aggressive repurchase plans look increasingly dicey.
</P>
<P>
   Consider two recent buyback announcements. On May 12, Primark
Corp., a supplier of information, analysis and software to
financial, corporate and government customers, announced that it
would buy back 4 million of its 27 million shares outstanding. The
company, based in Waltham, Mass., agreed to pay $34 to $41.50 a
share. The stock closed at $34.50 on that day. On Thursday, the
stock neared a 52-week low of $30.5625.
</P>
<P>
   A similar fate befell stockholders in Samsonite Corp., based in
Denver. Since the company's June 29 purchase of 51 percent of its
shares, Samsonite's stock price has fallen 21 percent, to $9.375.
</P>
<P>
   Some buybacks still produce a bounce. The stock of MGM Grand
Inc., based in Las Vegas, for instance, rose 21 percent on the June
23 announcement that it would buy back 20 percent of its common
stock. And it has remained at that level.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Primark and Samsonite examples show, not all buybacks
are created equal. For certain companies, share buybacks actually
reduce financial flexibility and imperil financial strength.
Investors need to distinguish between the good, the bad and the
ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Although a new share buyback plan seems to crop up every day,
the second quarter of 1998 saw the fewest number of such plans
since the third quarter of 1995. According to Securities Data Co.,
the value of the buybacks announced last quarter _ $29.5 billion _
was also the smallest in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders in big companies that are flush with cash generally
need not worry about a stock buyback's weakening the company's
financial position. But these companies are not the ones making
most of the buybacks. David Fried, editor of the Buyback Letter and
president of Fried Asset Management in Malibu, Calif., says that
roughly 5 percent of buybacks come from big-capitalization,
household-name companies. The rest are made by smaller,
less-well-capitalized companies.
</P>
<P>
   Most investors believe that stock buybacks reduce the number of
shares outstanding, leading to higher per-share earnings. But some
buybacks merely offset the dilution caused by employee stock option
awards, producing no real effect.
</P>
<P>
   What makes a buyback bad?
</P>
<P>
   Carol Levenson, editor of Gimme Credit, a Chicago-based service
that provides corporate bond advice to institutions, says that the
worst buyback is one in which a company borrows to fund it. Both
Primark and Samsonite borrowed to complete their buybacks.
</P>
<P>
   A Dutch auction, as conducted by Samsonite for 51 percent of its
stock, is also hazardous, Ms. Levenson says. That's because
companies that make such offers are locked into buying a set number
of shares. They cannot back out later if they get into a financial
bind.
</P>
<P>
   Be wary of companies, too, that use so much of their cash flow
to buy back shares that they must borrow to finance operations or
to make acquisitions. Fried said, ``I look for companies that have
enough money to pay dividends, do research and development and
acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Hercules Inc., the chemical company in
Wilmington, Del., with $1.9 billion in annual sales. On Jan. 27,
when its stock was at $47.75, Hercules announced that it was going
to resume its buyback program after a several-month hiatus. Six
months later, the company's long-term debt rating was put on review
by Moody's Investors Service for a possible downgrade.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The reason? Hercules' aggressive growth through debt-financed
acquisitions. The company's long-term debt totals 41 percent of
capital. Meanwhile, the company has spent $2.4 billion to buy back
27 percent of its shares outstanding since 1991. Thursday, the
stock closed at a 52-week low of $39.
</P>
<P>
   Another tipoff to a potentially dicey buyback? Ms. Levenson says
that companies planning to buy back 15 percent or more of their
stock will get a hard look from the debt rating agencies. And Fried
recommends avoiding companies that are buying back their stock even
as it trades at 25 or 30 times earnings. ``I like to see companies
buying their stocks at either below their sector multiple or below
the market multiple,'' he said. ``And where their growth rate is
higher and profit margins better than their peers.''
</P>
<P>
   Fried also steers clear of companies that are making large share
repurchases while their insiders are selling heavily.
</P>
<P>
   At some companies, a stock buyback can signal a significant
change in management strategy. If a company's managers have been
working to clean up the balance sheet but suddenly announce share
repurchases, Ms. Levenson says, they may have shifted priorities
from putting the company on sound financial footing to raising its
stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines may be such a case. Last September, $5.6 billion
of Delta's senior debt was upgraded by Standard &AMP; Poor's from junk
status to investment grade. S&AMP;P cited the company's strong revenue
growth, increased cash flow and cost-cutting measures, among other
reasons for its upgrade. Like all the airlines, Delta has benefited
from a boom in business and leisure travel and from rock-bottom oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Delta announced it would buy back $750 million of
its shares _ some 7 percent of its stock outstanding. Delta shares
rose almost 5 percent on the news, setting a record high that day
of $142.1875. It has since fallen back to $135.50.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Levenson, the buyback suggests that cleaning up the
balance sheet is no longer the top priority of Delta's management.
Delta may be able to raise its credit quality further because of
improving fundamentals; however the business is notoriously
volatile. In such a situation, Ms. Levenson said, ``I advise
bondholders not to look for further upside and to watch for any
shock to the system, because these companies don't have the
financial flexibility that they would have had, had they paid down
their debt.''

TOUGH NEW GUN CONTROL LAW NEARS ENACTMENT IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Senate Thursday passed the final version of an
assault weapons ban that, in all likelihood, will give
Massachusetts one of the strongest and most comprehensive gun
control laws in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The measure bans all forms of assault weapons &UR;  &LR; that were made
after 1994, when a federal assault weapons ban took effect. It also
adds restrictions to all other weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill will give Massachusetts what is the toughest gun
control law in the country,'' Senator Cheryl Jacques said in
announcing an agreement struck between both legislative branches.
``What this bill is going to do is make sure gun owners take dead
seriously their responsibility to safely store their weapons or
face criminal penalties. I would have preferred (a total) ban ...
(but) this bill is chock full of good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts bill mirrors the 1994 federal ban, which the
state had to adopt to prosecute criminals under that law. But the
Massachusetts bill goes further _ it adds a layer of penalties and
safety regulations on the industry, including mandatory safety
locks on any new gun sold in the state. The bill does not, however,
prohibit the sale or resale of assault weapons that were
manufactured before 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the compromise deal scraps the idea of a
politically appointed board that could overrule police chiefs'
discretion in handing out firearm licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Snow, executive secretary of the Gun Owners Action League,
condemned the legislation _ which she agreed was the most
far-reaching in the country _ for its increased licensing fees. She
believes it gives too much power to police chiefs in determining
who should be granted permission to carry a firearm, without an
easy appeal process.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The agreement, announced Thursday, was immediately passed by
the Senate, 22-14, with mostly Republicans rejecting the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is expected to pass the House and be signed by Acting
Governor Paul Cellucci by July 31. Cellucci lauded the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have preferred a total ban,'' Cellucci said, ``... but
this is a significant gun control initiative. I will sign the
bill.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rosenthal, founder of the Boston-based Stop Handgun
Violence, called the legislation a national model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you from personal experience in meeting at the
White House (that) the whole country is watching what Massachusetts
is doing,'' Rosenthal said. ``My disappointment is that we still
allow the possession and sale of assault weapons in a society where
we don't even allow our state troopers to carry anything more
powerful than a shotgun ... That is insane. Our job is not done,
but this legislation goes a long way to fill some holes.''
</P>
<P>
   The House version of the bill set up a politically appointed
appeals board that could overrule police chief's decisions on
granting gun licenses. But police chiefs from across the state
protested that provision, winning out in the end. Snow also
predicted licensing backlogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every gun owner will run afoul of some provision at some time
because it's so confusing and so comprehensive,'' Snow said. ``I'm
very thankful that the Legislature did see the wisdom of not doing
a conventional assault weapons ban, but at the same time we are
very unhappy with the liberty they've taken with gun owners'
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation:
</P>
<P>
   _Adopts the federal assault weapons ban, which prohibits the
possession or sale of guns manufactured after Sept. 13, 1994. This
will allow for state prosecution of anyone violating the federal
ban.
</P>
<P>
   _Establishes criminal penalties for negligent gun storage, and
requires any new gun sold in the state to come with locks. Existing
guns must be fitted with locks or kept in a safe.
</P>
<P>
   _Increases penalties for a variety of gun-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
   _Prohibits mail-order gun sales within the state. Guns can be
sold only in person to a person with a valid license or permit.
</P>
<P>
   _Makes firearm identification arms and licenses to carry
renewable every four years, at a cost of $25. Currently, FIDs are
granted for life and licenses are renewable every five years.
</P>
<P>
   _Establishes a recordkeeping trust fund that receives half of
the licensing fees in order to conduct background checks. Cities
and towns would keep the other half of the money.
</P>
<P>
   _Prohibits violent felons and those convicted of drug
trafficking from ever carrying or owning a gun.
</P>
<P>
   _Prohibits the possession of sawed-off shotguns, so-called
gadget guns, and Saturday Night Specials, which are inexpensive and
poorly made handguns.
</P>
<P>
   _Allows gun club members to use high-capacity guns at shooting
ranges.
</P>
<P>
   _All new license applicants must pass a training course in gun
safety.

MY COMPUTER SURFS WITHOUT ME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: I have been advised that it is wiser to leave
my computer on at all times. The problem is that four out of five
days, I wake up with my home page displayed rather than my desktop.
Someone told me that the computer does in fact call my Internet
server several times during the night. I wonder if this is a glitch
in my PC or if some piece of downloaded software may be doing this.
_ Haunted
</P>
<P>
   Dear Haunted: Your PC is doing exactly what it's supposed to do.
Well, it's doing what Microsoft wants it to, and that's all that's
important. In fact, I think there's some sort of federal law to
that effect, or there will be when Microsoft gets through with
Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Big Bill and his merry band of marauders think that the Internet
is just an extension of your desktop, and that data from it should
be just as readily available as if it were on your own hard drive.
A continuous connection to the Net is perfect for that scenario,
but because most of us can't afford that luxury, Windows 98 and the
most recent versions of Win95 will make a connection when needed.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you have a program that periodically checks the Internet
for whatever, your computer is probably dialing on its own. Either
that, or Mulder and Scully are right. Look for a check box on your
Internet dialer screen that says ``Connect as needed'' or some such
thing and uncheck it to put a stop to automatic dialing.
</P>
<P>
   And don't be such a weenie about turning your computer off.
Nobody's got the right answer to that one. Continuous use will
eventually wear out the drive and fan motors; turning it off and on
jolts the circuits and eventually fries something. Who cares? Live
dangerously.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: Open Microsoft Word and type in the phrase
``unable to follow directions.'' Highlight the phrase, then go to
Tools/Thesaurus (Shift-F7 works, too) and look at the results. Now
the question: Is this the Department of Justice's most fervent wish
for Big Bill? _ Perplexed
</P>
<P>
   Dear Perplexed: Actually, I think it may be a sign that my
ex-girlfriend found a job as a Microsoft programmer.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: I have to respond to ``Tom.'' ``(Note: Tom
wondered if women whose husbands spy on their online adventures did
something to earn the mistrust.)'' I think my husband is doing
similar tricks, and, no, I don't deserve it. Some husbands are
suspicious of everything, even when NOTHING is going on. And, just
maybe, if they spy long enough, their wives will get so sick of it,
they might just run away with a computer geek. _ Fed Up
</P>
<P>
   Dear Fed: Meet you at the Hyatt next Tuesday afternoon, just
like always?
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: Your column often uses the words ``anal'' or
``anal retentive.'' I'm not sure what you really mean. Could you
please explain? _ Puzzled
</P>
<P>
   Dear Puzz: Just read the next letter.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: You do your readers a great disservice with
your feeble, childish attempts at humor. People foolishly come to
you seeking help, and all they get in return are sophomoric
insults. You would be well-advised to take a more serious,
businesslike tone, like the informative columnists in ``PC
Magazine'' and ``PC World'' who actually know what they are talking
about. _ Badly in Need of Bran
</P>
<P>
   Dear Badly: Does that answer your question, Puzzled?

TED TURNER'S AW-SHUCKS ACT DOES IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Jed Clampett met the press the other day, and
not a moment too soon. Here we were chomping at the bit, wanting
heads to roll and bemoaning the lost civilization of TV journalism,
and along comes this guy who looks like one of the corporate suits,
until he slips behind a podium and opens his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner, billionaire and closet comedian, is perhaps the most
underrated and unassuming media mogul, a filthy rich country
bumpkin who puts you in mind of the most famous Beverly
Hills-billy, a global controller who can first disarm you and then
shame you for ever thinking he's slow on the uptake.
</P>
<P>
   That's precisely what Turner did one day last week as he faced a
ballroom packed with TV critics wanting blood over the CNN mess,
the one about nerve gas, rushing to judgment, newsmagazine
competition, media retractions and star reporters lending their
fame but not their reporting to news reports.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a couple weeks since CNN News Group chairman Tom
Johnson humbly apologized for a report that the U.S. military used
lethal nerve gas in 1970 during a secret mission aimed at killing
American defectors in Vietnam. The report was retracted after
criticism mounted that the evidence was suspicious; three producers
lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout had anyone ever connected with CNN cringing in
disgrace or hiding in the nearest bush. But we wanted more. We
wanted Ted.
</P>
<P>
   He hadn't said a thing since the report aired on the June 7
premiere of ``NewsStand: CNN &AMP; Time,'' since the story started
falling apart, since CNN's credibility started to crumble, bit by
bit, like a weakened empire.
</P>
<P>
   As Turner Broadcasting presented its fall programming to the
media, moving gingerly from TBS to TNT to the Cartoon Channel,
Turner sat quietly in the back row, surveying the land, chewing the
heck out of a stick of gum, plotting his path.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see him weasel out of this,'' a journalist said.
``Welcome to the firing squad,'' another said.
</P>
<P>
   Shrewdly and humbly during his participation in introducing
CNN's ``Cold War'' series, Turner poked and needled us about his
upcoming remarks. He tossed in jokes to ease the tension, to soften
us up, an incredibly effective tool, because ground rules had been
set: No nerve-gas questions until other business was out of harm's
way.
</P>
<P>
   Once Turner glided over to the podium to take questions, he
quickly fired a long-winded list of apologies, comparing the
incident with ``the greatest catastrophes in my life,'' ranking it
up there with the death of his father, with the breakup of two of
his marriages, with the Braves losing the World Series to the
Yankees after being up two games to none.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nightmare,'' he said in that thick Georgia accent. ``I
mean, I just don't know that aside of self-flagellation ... If I
thought it would do good, if anybody has a whip here, I'll just
take my shirt off and beat myself until I'm bloody on the back, if
it would make anybody feel better. I couldn't hurt any more if I
was bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a fighter refusing to go down, Turner stood tough and took
his verbal punishment. How damaged is CNN? Did you see the report
before it aired? Do you believe the story?
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember what Christ said when they were going to stone the
prostitute?'' Turner says. ``Let he who is without sin cast the
first stone. And I think that the majority of the people will
forgive and forget. We have some enemies out there that won't
forget, and they wouldn't be satisfied no matter what we did,
unless we just signed off.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner didn't answer one question without the acknowledgment of
a news report gone terribly wrong, without mentioning the
tabloidization of news, without attacking the profit-making
machinery of TV journalism, particularly local news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't watch it much because it makes me ill,'' he said,
speaking of local TV. ``There's nothing but one fire, one killing;
there's so little substantive.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner is a product of old money, but he is, in many ways, a
self-made man by virtue of wanting and needing to go his own way.
He is outspoken and charming, and in many ways his Southern dialect
masks his strengths in these parts, feeding into the stereotype of
Southerners as dimwits, even very rich ones.
</P>
<P>
   After the session, Turner disappeared, but his spirit remained.
Writers who rushed to their rooms to file their reports returned
later to a poolside feast of hot dogs and burgers in honor of the
Goodwill Games, which Turner Broadcasting will televise beginning
this month.
</P>
<P>
   They chowed down and talked of Turner, the man. Of his
feistiness, of his smarts, of his willingness to come and face the
music. ``I like him,'' one reported said. ``A pretty upfront guy,''
another said.
</P>
<P>
   That Ted Turner. He did it again.

NANCY JUST SHOWED UP AT AUNT FRITZI'S ONE DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I've read the comic strip ``Nancy'' all my life and have
never seen a reference to Nancy's real parents or why Aunt Fritzi
has custody of her. What's the explanation? _ M.H., Burleson, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: These things have never been explained, according to current
``Nancy'' cartoonist Guy Gilchrist.
</P>
<P>
   When the 7-year-old Nancy first showed up in 1933, the strip was
called ``Fritzi Ritz,'' and she had been the star for 11 years.
``Nancy appeared at Fritzi's doorstep without a history,''
Gilchrist writes on his World Wide Web site at
www.gilchriststudios.com.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Bushmiller, who took over ``Fritzi Ritz'' three years into
its run in 1925, renamed it ``Nancy'' in 1938. The strip was
carried in as many as 880 newspapers when drawn by Bushmiller, who
died in 1982 at age 76.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the John Wayne movie ``Stagecoach,'' what was the name of
the woman portraying the boarding house manager? She had a small
speaking part when Doc was evicted. _ N.C., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: Doc's landlady was portrayed by Nora Cecil, a character actor
who worked steadily in small roles from 1915 to 1947.
</P>
<P>
   No information could be found about Cecil aside from her
credits, which included films such as ``Mourning Becomes Electra,''
``I Married a Witch'' and ``Gold Diggers of 1935.''
</P>
<P>
   Cecil, who was sometimes credited as Nora or Norah Cecile, often
played schoolteachers, witches and gossips.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will the PBS show John Denver was working on still be
broadcast? _ J.B., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: PBS plans to air ``John Denver: Let This Be a Voice'' on Dec.
6 as part of the network's ``Nature'' series.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Let This Be a Voice,'' Denver visits places in the U.S.
West that inspired his music. Filming on the project was completed
before Denver's death in an Oct. 12, 1997, plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   The program's title may change before air time, according to a
PBS representative.  &QL;

WHAT'S THAT IN THE SINK? PROBABLY A GERM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I turned down the germ guru's ``once-in-a-lifetime opportunity''
for an in-home briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Gerba, a microbiologist at the University of Arizona
who has been one of the leading germ experts for 25 years, offered
to swab the ``hot zones'' in my kitchen and bathroom last week, but
I opted for an in-office interview.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness. He took one look at my desk and suggested that
we find some place else to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Gerba, who dubs himself ``the sultan of slime,'' says that in
most of the homes he has studied, he would be better off making a
turkey sandwich on the rim of the toilet bowl than on the
germ-laden counter top in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to feel safer in the bathroom than the kitchen,
unless it's a public bathroom,'' Gerba said. ``Most people
disinfect their bathrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, is the reason the kitchen has become the main
battlefield of home-front germ warfare.
</P>
<P>
   In the first scientific study of germs in homes, Gerba found
many more in kitchens than in bathrooms. His study will be
published in ``The Journal of Applied Microbiology'' this fall. He
was in Fort Worth last week as part of an educational tour
sponsored by Clorox bleach.
</P>
<P>
   His study identifies sinks, cutting boards, sponges, faucet
handles and commode handles as the worst breeding grounds for
bacteria in the home.
</P>
<P>
   How many bacteria does it take to make people sick? Even the
Food and Drug Administration can't provide an answer to like that.
It depends on the bacteria involved, for one thing. Many microbes
are a normal part of our environment and don't cause illness except
in unusual circumstances. But the common-sense conclusion is that
the more bacteria ingested, the more likely illness will occur. For
some, it can take as few as 10 bacteria to get sick; for others, it
can be millions.
</P>
<P>
   And millions are what Gerba found in his recent seven-month,
in-home study of 15 typical homes with families of two adults and
two children _ no dogs allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Sponges and dishcloths topped the list, with a count of more
than 7 billion bacteria per average-size sponge. Frequently touched
kitchen faucet handles netted an average 229,000 microbes per
square inch, and cutting boards registered an average 62,000 per
square inch.
</P>
<P>
   Our floors are much cleaner than our sinks, Gerba said, and
that's ironic because most of us will rinse off things that drop in
the sink during food preparation and use them, although anything
accidentally dropped on the floor gets thrown away.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is, his random weekly samplings found that
microbes in the home are reduced by 99 percent when people start
cleaning all hard surfaces with bleach-based products that clean
and disinfect. Of course, the Clorox people figured that would
happen when they funded the study.
</P>
<P>
   Gerba also recommends filling the sink with a water-and-bleach
solution and soaking sponges, dishcloths and the sink and drain
every day and using a bleach-and-water solution on cutting boards
after every use.
</P>
<P>
   High-touch zones, such as handles, should be disinfected about
three times a week. Toilets, showers, tubs, drains and kitchen and
bathroom floors need disinfecting once a week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Preventive medicine begins at home, the source of about 80
percent of all food-borne illness, Gerba said. I never thought of
cleaning and disinfecting my kitchen as preventive medicine, but it
makes sense.

HOPE FOR SYPHILIS VACCINE OFFERED BY DNA BREAKTHROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN Md., Texas)   (bl)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The master plan of a deadly and elusive microbe has been
deciphered by a team of genetic code-breakers, raising hopes that
for the first time a vaccine can be devised against it.
</P>
<P>
   The pathogen is Treponema pallidum, the organism that causes
syphilis. Its full DNA or genome, containing the entire instruction
set it needs to infect and thrive in human cells, has now been
deciphered by biologists at the Institute for Genomic Research in
Rockville, Md., and the University of Texas Health Science Center
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Their work is reported in Friday's issue of Science, accompanied
by an appeal from two government health officials for a program to
eliminate syphilis, an easily treatable disease that in the United
States now affects chiefly the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The syphilis spirochete, a kind of bacterium, burst upon Europe
shortly after Columbus' return from America, which indicates it was
introduced from the New World. Though it was brought substantially
under control by penicillin, still the standard treatment, syphilis
has continued to elude both researchers and public health
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The organism cloaks its protein structure in a veil of fatlike
material, a stratagem that denies obvious targets both to the
immune system and to vaccine-makers. And it continues to infect
Americans in periodic waves of disease, leaving a wake of
congenitally impaired infants and, most recently, of HIV, whose
transmission is enhanced by syphilis.
</P>
<P>
   The decoding of the spirochete's DNA lays bare every guile with
which evolution has endowed it, including its abilities to infect
human cells, to lie latent for years while evading the immune
system, and to destroy body tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Though the germ's secret plans have now been captured, it will
take biologists several years to understand them. The spirochete's
genome, or full DNA, possesses 1,041 different genes. About half,
as judged by their sequence of DNA letters, are similar to genes
found in other bacteria, particularly the fellow spirochete that
causes Lyme disease, and the rest are unique to Treponema pallidum.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Having this genome in hand opens the door to unlimited
possibilities,'' said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which spent $750,000
for the syphilis sequencing project.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about syphilis, compared with other bacteria,
because it cannot be grown in the test tube. The organism relies on
its human host for many essential nutrients and biologists have
been unable to ascertain the complete list.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Norris, of the University of Texas, started to work
on this problem as a graduate student 23 years ago. In 1991 he
joined forces with a colleague, Dr. George Weinstock, and the two
biologists decided the growth requirements of the fastidious
organism could only be discovered by sequencing its genome, a feat
impossible by the methods then available.
</P>
<P>
   When the first bacterial genome was sequenced by the Institute
for Genomic Research in 1995, Norris and Weinstock asked Dr. Claire
Fraser to help complete the syphilis project, which was done in two
years. It proved difficult, Dr. Fraser said, in part because there
was not enough DNA available. Supplies are obtained by the
difficult method of growing the bacterium in rabbit testicles.
</P>
<P>
   Because the spirochete's genome is so small, she decided she
could risk omitting a customary sequencing step, but found there
were pieces of DNA she could not fit together unambiguously.
Fortunately a new computer program solved the problem. ``This was
probably the perfect example of how not to do a genome project,''
she said. The syphilis genome is the seventh bacterial genome
completed by the institute. Another seven have been sequenced
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The syphilis genome offers biologists a wealth of ideas for
exploring and sabotaging the organism's anatomy. ``It's an enormous
amount of information we have got that we didn't have a prayer of
getting before,'' Weinstock said. He noted that it should be
possible to devise better diagnostic tests immediately since the
organism's proteins can now be generated from their genetic
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Norris said he had identified a family of 12 different kinds of
protein that stud the spirochete's surface and may make suitable
targets for vaccines. The many genes that are unique to the
syphilis organism probably reflect the great antiquity of
spirochetes and the separate evolutionary path they have followed
from most other bacteria, Weinstock said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the extreme age of the spirochetes, which have existed
for well over 100 million years, Treponema pallidum presumably
learned only recently how to infect humans, a host with a mere
100,000-year ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   Syphilis has no animal host, one of several factors that make
the disease particularly easy to eliminate from the United States,
said Dr. Michael St. Louis and Dr. Judith Wasserheit, of the
Centers for Disease and Prevention Control, in an article
accompanying the genome report.
</P>
<P>
   Syphilis is now at the ebb of one its periodic cycles, the ideal
time to get rid of it altogether, they said. Though treatable with
a single shot of penicillin, the disease continues to smolder,
infecting particularly black Americans in Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   A five-year, $100 million program could effectively eliminate
the disease, as has already been done in several European
countries, and would be cheap compared with the annual $80 million
cost of treating it, the two health officials wrote.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Nasdaq composite index topped 2,000 Thursday,
powered by the high-technology stocks that dominate the index and
investors' preference for big, well-known companies at a time when
the market outlook is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of choppy trading, the Nasdaq had trouble holding on at
the 2,000 level. It broke through early, then fell as low as
1,982.86. It popped above 2,000 again early in the afternoon and
near the end of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Then it barely held on, falling to 1,999.99 just at the close
and inching up to settle at 2,000.56, up 6.02 points on the day.
The Nasdaq is now up 27.4 percent this year, the best performance
of the major indexes.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which rose 93.72 points, or 1
percent, to 9,328.19, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500
stocks, which climbed 9.18 points, to 1,183.99, also set new highs.
It was the first time the Dow closed above 9,300.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which hit 1,000 just three years ago, becomes the
third of the major indexes to cross a 1,000-point barrier this
year. The Dow hit 9,000 for the first time on April 6 and the S&AMP;P
500 crossed 1,000 on Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The big-name stocks _ Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Intel, Dell
Computer and Worldcom _ that carried the Nasdaq on its last
1,000-point run, show how much the nature of the index has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not that long ago that the Nasdaq was identified with
smaller-company stocks,'' said Laszlo Birinyi, head of Birinyi
Associates, a market research firm. This year's performance and the
breaking of 2,000, he said, ``is as much a tribute to large-cap
stocks as to how well technology stocks have done.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's rally has been driven by the nice surprises in the
first flood of second-quarter earnings reports. Among the investor
pleasers have been Eastman Kodak, Apple Computer, Tellabs and SBC
Communications. After the market closed, Microsoft reported
earnings of 50 cents a diluted share, beating forecasts by 2 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Eastman Kodak led the Dow higher, a day after it announced
earnings that were much better than expected. It rose 4 1/2, to 87,
on Thursday, accounting for 19 points of the Dow's rally.
</P>
<P>
   Apple reported earnings after the market close Wednesday that
were double what analysts had expected. Thursday its stock rose 3
1/16, to 37 1/2, a 52-week high.
</P>
<P>
   But Apple has not been a big player in Nasdaq's recent run. Even
its 185 percent gain this year has failed to restore it to the $49
level where it stood on July 17, 1995, when the Nasdaq crossed its
first 1,000 barrier. It has been the sixth-biggest drag on the the
Nasdaq over the last three years, according to Birinyi Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 500 companies in the S&AMP;P 500, 155 had reported their
profits for the quarter by Thursday, according to First Call Corp.,
which compiles earnings estimates. Of these, 94 beat expectations,
including 37 that reported earnings that exceeded forecasts by 5
percent or more. However, some of these surprises resulted in part
from companies that had jawboned down expectations ahead of their
earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Hill, director of research at First Call, forecast that
the positive surprises will be enough for an overall 4 percent
increase in second-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But that pace is still well below the double-digit rates of the
last several years. And the current outlook among many economists
is that economic growth will slow in months ahead, in part because
of the decline in American exports to weakened economies in Asia.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because earnings are relatively weak, Douglas Cliggott, the U.S.
equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Securities, said he believes that
many investors are pushing stocks higher on the belief that
earnings will revive over the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that technology stocks had benefited greatly from
this bet. ``Historically,'' he said, ``the place to bet on
long-term growth, as opposed to near-term earnings, is
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq index started at 100 on Feb. 5, 1971, and took 24 1/2
years to reach 1,000 on July 17, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Birinyi Associates said five stocks accounted for about
two-thirds of the last 1,000-point Nasdaq run: Microsoft, 31.2
percent, Cisco Systems, 11.33 percent, Intel, 10.4 percent, Dell
Computer, 9.8 percent, and Worldcom, 5 percent.

<P>
   Pontiac's best-selling car, the Grand Am, might not be quite as
exciting as some of the General Motors division's other offerings,
such as the Trans Am and the Grand Prix GT.
</P>
<P>
   But for the money _ with prices starting at just under $17,000 _
the completely redesigned 1999 Grand Am SE Coupe serves up a large
portion of Pontiac excitement. Pontiac executives decided in the
mid-80s to focus their division on performance and excitement, and
it's amazing how well they've done that, even with their
volume-leading compact Grand Am sedan and coupe.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior changes for 1999 are subtle; the car still looks
very much like last year's Grand Am, but those looks are deceiving.
The car is a bit shorter than the previous model, but its wheelbase
is nearly 4 inches longer. The track is 3.3 inches wider for more
sure-footed handling, but the overall width is just an
inch-and-a-half wider.
</P>
<P>
   These changes make the cabin roomier, although in our coupe test
model, we found the back seat to be a tight fit for adults. That's
to be expected in the compact class, however, particularly in a
two-door model.
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive attributes of the Grand Am Coupe, beyond its
aggressive and very appealing styling, are its excellent
road-handling abilities and surprisingly good power. Granted, our
test vehicle was the SE2 model, which comes with the optional
3.4-liter V-6 engine, rated at 170 horsepower and 195 foot-pounds
of torque.
</P>
<P>
   But even the base engine, the 2.4-liter four-cylinder, cranks
out a respectable 150 horsepower. It is the most powerful standard
engine in the compact class.
</P>
<P>
   The four-cylinder is a carryover from last year, but the V-6 is
an all-new power plant. It has 15 more horsepower than the '98
Grand Am's 3.1-liter V-6, and delivers just slightly less fuel
economy (one mile per gallon less, city or highway).
</P>
<P>
   The most torque is at the lower-to-middle part of the scale,
which means that the Grand Am with the V-6 takes off like a rocket
and offers great acceleration for passing and freeway merging,
where most people need the most power. At higher speeds, there's
not much zip left, however.
</P>
<P>
   Cornering and traction are excellent, aided by the wide track,
new four-wheel independent suspension, and a standard
traction-control system that works automatically to reduce spin and
deliver power to the wheel that still has a grip. The steering is
tight and precise, which adds to the sports car feel.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for serious enthusiasts, the SE Coupe comes only
with a four-speed automatic transmission; no manual gearbox is
available. This is a vehicle that cries for a manual transmission,
and maybe if enough people complain, Pontiac will eventually add
one.
</P>
<P>
   One great improvement over the previous generation of Grand Am
is visibility for the driver. There is more glass to see through,
thanks to narrower windshield and door pillars. The rear window has
so much glass that rear-seat passengers need only look up to see
the sky. That can be a liability when the sun is beating down,
though. And if rear-seat passengers aren't firmly belted in, their
heads will hit glass, not the headliner, when the car hits a bump.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, the interior is well laid out, with lots of
thought put into the placement of gauges and controls. Our car came
with cruise control and radio buttons at the bottom of the steering
wheel. The heating and air-conditioning controls are also within
easy reach and are simple to use.
</P>
<P>
   The air-conditioning, which is standard on all models, is one of
the best in the class. The huge air nozzles in the center and on
each side of the dash are easily aimed and, even in the current
Texas heat, the system cools the vehicle quickly.
</P>
<P>
   This new Grand Am comes with the newer-generation depowered air
bags to make the right front seat safer for younger and smaller
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard safety features include antilock brakes (usually
an option on other cars in this class), side-impact protection,
daytime running lights with an automatic-on feature for headlights
and tail lights at night, fog lights, and rear cornering lights.
Battery rundown protection automatically turns off accessories and
lights that are inadvertently left on.
</P>
<P>
   Coupe models come in three trim levels: base SE, midlevel SE1
and uplevel SE2. A GT version also is on the way, with sportier
performance and appearance. Standard features include power windows
and door locks with remote key less entry, variable- effort power
steering, power front disc/rear drum brakes, rear defogger, tilt
steering wheel, tachometer and remote trunk release.
</P>
<P>
   Our SE2 test car, with a base price of $18,770 plus $525
transportation, came with some extras not found on the SE or SE1,
including 16-inch aluminum wheels with special touring tires,
cruise control, power mirrors, four-way manual-adjust driver's seat
with power height adjustment, split-folding rear seat and a sport
interior package that included driver's seat lumbar adjustment,
leather-wrapped steering wheel, sun visor extensions, and a cargo
net in the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Standard on the SE2 is an in-dash AM/FM/compact-disc stereo with
six speakers; our car had the upgraded unit ($195) that also had a
cassette deck. The only other option on our vehicle was the
rear-deck spoiler ($195). Total sticker was $19,700, including
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 20 miles per gallon in the city and
28 on the highway for the V-6 model. The tank holds 15.2 gallons of
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   NO MORE SUPRA: Toyota will drop its slow-selling Supra sports
car after the current model, company officials said last week. The
car, whose prices range from $30,000 to just over $40,000, hasn't
done well since Toyota went upscale (and up-price) with it in 1993.

BLUEGRASS SON RANDY SCRUGGS LEARNED HIS LESSONS WELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHIRLEY JINKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Randy Scruggs, the fortysomething son of bluegrass legend Earl
Scruggs, is the ultimate Nashville insider. Mother Maybelle Carter
was his baby sitter, and he grew up with people such as The Byrds,
Ravi Shankar, Johnny Cash, Linda Ronstadt and Neil Young hanging
around the house.
</P>
<P>
   So it's hardly surprising that Scruggs' first solo album,
``Crown of Jewels,'' issued Tuesday on Reprise, reflects a rare
musical pedigree. The award-winning producer, songwriter and
instrumentalist sees his album as more than a biographical work;
it's extreme collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the guy that connects Mother Maybelle Carter to Deana
Carter,'' said Jason Catz, Scruggs' Nashville agent.
</P>
<P>
   It was Maybelle's autoharp that first inspired 6-year-old Randy,
and later, at 11, he picked up the acoustic guitar. He remembers
being pulled out of middle school once to record on a Waylon
Jennings session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always enjoyed growing up on the technical side (of
recording),'' Scruggs said last week from Nashville. ``I got to go
to some of those early recording sessions, like Bob Dylan when he
did part of the `John Wesley Harding' album, and the `Blonde on
Blonde' album.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simon and Garfunkel recorded here back then, and Neil Young. I
was at the session where he recorded `Heart of Gold.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After high school, Randy joined his dad and brothers in The Earl
Scruggs Revue. That celebrated band combined traditional
instrumentation with a contemporary format, Randy Scruggs'
trademark today. Scruggs continued playing with such stars as
Ronstadt, Cash, the Dirt Band and Ricky Skaggs, and in 1980 he
opened his own studio and production company.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I built the studio here, at some point I hoped to produce
records, but I thought it would be way down the line,'' he said.
``In the first month, Waylon Jennings came by and said he wanted to
record at the studio and wanted me to produce him.'' Scruggs ended
up playing on Jennings' album of Billy Joe Shaver songs and his
``Dukes of Hazzard'' project.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a Sawyer Brown album came along, and suddenly Scruggs
found himself in business. His work on the second volume of the
Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's ``Will the Circle Be Unbroken'' won him
accolades as Country Music Association producer of the year in
1989, and netted him a country instrumental Grammy the same year
for ``Amazing Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   He produced the critically acclaimed 1992 compilation album
``Red Hot &AMP; Country,'' an album to benefit AIDS research, and later
``Keith Whitley _ A Tribute Album,'' which gave rise to Alison
Krauss and Union Station's ``When You Say Nothing at All.''
</P>
<P>
   Scruggs' dozens of songwriting credits include cuts by Trisha
Yearwood, Patty Loveless, Sawyer Brown, Steve Wariner, Waylon
Jennings and, most recently, Deana Carter's hit ``We Danced
Anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Crown of Jewels'' is being issued to three radio formats:
country, Americana and Triple AAA. Recording of the album took on a
life of its own, lasting over a year to accommodate everyone's
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was similar to casting a movie; creating a wish list who I
wanted on what songs,'' Scruggs said. ``Yet I wanted to have a
thread to run throughout the record, that of my musical life.''
</P>
<P>
   Old favorites on the album include ``A Soldier's Joy''
instrumental with Vince Gill; the Carter Family's ``Wildwood
Flower'' with Emmylou Harris and Iris DeMent; and ``City of New
Orleans'' with John Prine. Travis Tritt lends vocals on ``Amie.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven originals include Earl Scruggs' ``Lonesome Reuben''
instrumental, Bruce Hornsby's ``Crown of Jewels,'' and Scruggs'
collaborations with Rosanne Cash (''My Secret Life)'' and Mary
Chapin Carpenter (''It's Only Love).'' His own Dylanesque vocals
take the lead on ``I Wanna Be Loved Back,'' and join with Joan
Osborne's on the Johnny Cash-penned ``Passin' Thru.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you express any part of music, you want to express your
emotions,'' Scruggs said of his singing. ``I've always felt the
emotions of singing, even when I just played.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Mother Maybelle's onetime charge plans a classic
Nashville life: He'll tour in the fall with special guest artists,
and he plans another solo project down the line.

COVERING AMERICA'S TABOO SUBJECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Orlando Bagwell's latest documentary, ``Africans in America:
America's Journey Though Slavery,'' weighs in at six
commercial-free hours, its companion book at 472 pages. It is, as
its producer and driving force says, ``definitive in scale.'' Some
understatement, considering this treasure hunt for a seemingly
impossible audience.
</P>
<P>
   It's not merely that some white Americans are weary of hearing
about slavery and how it might have crippled generations of black
Americans. Black folk themselves often find the subject emotionally
exhausting, painful, even humiliating _ certainly not dinner table
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The series, to air over three nights on PBS in October, begins
in 1607, the beginning of the largest forced human migrations in
recorded history. It ends in 1865, with this country's Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Although the TV miniseries ``Roots'' drew an enormous following
despite its graphic depictions of vicious cruelty toward slaves, it
was also mainstream entertainment. ``Africans in America'' isn't
packaged for mainstream consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell filmed on location across 12 states and three
continents, researching hundreds of journals and letters and
collecting drawings, paintings and photographs to mix with
interviews of scholars and writers and descendants. Judging from
one 90-minute segment previewed, it keeps the series from taking on
the stuffy look of intellectuals talking over our heads.
</P>
<P>
   A black man whose list of accomplishments is far too long to
name here, Bagwell has the steady, determined look of a
buttoned-down professor. When he talks, he rarely smiles, even when
a joke is tossed his way. But what better filmmaker to handle such
a difficult piece of work?
</P>
<P>
   Slavery remains our national Achilles' heel, a cancer that many
wish would simply be cured and forgotten. Bagwell wasn't surprised
when, near the end of a session he conducted with members of the TV
press corps, a journalist asked the panel if America would ever
``put all this behind us?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are lots of people of good will and conscience,
as Dr. King might put it, who really do want that beloved community
he spoke of,'' responded one panelist, writer Charles Johnson,
whose novel ``Middle Passage'' is a classic. ``But you can't block
out how we got to this moment in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans have yet to grow weary of hearing or commemorating
something as horrible as the Holocaust, but the issues surrounding
slavery have always shouldered the burden of less tolerance and
patience. Part of it has to do with geographic guilt: Slavery
happened here, its brutality carried out by everyday Americans and
presidents alike.
</P>
<P>
   We have to understand the history, its complexity and the
participation of all kinds of people, black, white, Asian and
others who made this the nation it was. Only then will moving
forward be possible, for it would be with wisdom, as opposed to
ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   What African-Americans want to point out is the uncomfortable
truth that nearly everyone has some kind of implication, in terms
of their family or themselves. Most of us are stained. For
instance, you didn't have to own slaves to be involved. You didn't
have to be on a slave ship. The whole industry, from providing food
for the slave captors to producing materials to build the ships on
which they sailed, is explored. The money from slavery
sub-industries made some American families wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say that people need to walk around with their
heads down. But it does need to be acknowledged, Bagwell says.
</P>
<P>
   Plan A for Bagwell is to hit the schools, to offer the series
and its companion book, penned by Johnson. ``That in itself is a
challenge,'' Bagwell says, ``since a lot of teen-agers I've met
while traveling and talking about this series don't even know where
PBS is on their TV dial.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we aim to inundate them, to make them aware somehow, to
either watch the program or read the book or get hold of something
about slavery, its origins, its truths, its legacy. It might be too
much for some, but overall, it's not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's distressing news to the journalist who asked
about getting beyond this slavery thing. It's wishful thinking. In
fact, mounting the stage as the ``Africans in America'' panel
departed was Macky Alston, who was there to discuss his
documentary, ``Family Name,'' a film about a white man who tracks
the descendants of the slaves and slave owners who lived on the
North Carolina plantations once owned by his family.
</P>
<P>
   One way to find them was to go through the phone book of a tiny
North Carolina town, finding dozens of Alstons, black and white,
none of whom wanted to talk to him. Not about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's painful,'' Alston tells us, sounding much like the black
man who preceded him. ``I hope people who watch this film can use
the Alstons' experiences as a way to explore how slavery affects us
to this day ... someday we'll get beyond silence, guilt and blame _
but only after we confront the truth.''

TEXT OF COURT RULING ON SECRET SERVICE AGENTS' TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CLINTON-STARR) 
(bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following is the text of the ruling Thursday by the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on the
Justice Department's request to postpone the grand jury testimony
of Secret Service agents from President Clinton's detail:
</P>
<P>
   Upon consideration of the emergency motion for a stay and an
order under the All Writs Act pending disposition of the petition
for rehearing in banc, and the opposition thereto, it is:
</P>
<P>
   Ordered that the request of the Department of Justice for a stay
pending the filing and eventual disposition of a petition for a
writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court be denied. The motion of
the Department of Justice for an order, under the All Writs Act,
postponing the testimony of seven Secret Service officers before
the grand jury is denied. The administrative stay issued on July
16, 1998, is continued until 12 noon July 17, 1998, to give the
Department of Justice an opportunity to seek relief from the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Justice has not made a sufficient showing that
irreparable harm will result unless a stay and an order are issued,
and it has not made a sufficient showing that it will ultimately
prevail in establishing the privilege it alleges. The privilege is
said to be necessary because, without it, the President will
distance himself from Secret Service agents charged with the duty
of protecting him. The harm asserted is future harm, depending on a
prediction about what the President will do in the absence of
privilege. This court has ruled that the privilege does not exist;
no judge on the court has even requested a vote on the Justice
Department's suggestion for rehearing en banc. If harm of the sort
that the department envisions is now occurring, it therefore must
be because the President does not believe the Supreme Court will
sustain the privilege. Neither a stay nor an order under the All
Writs Act can alter or prevent that alleged harm. Testimony today
by Secret Service agents regarding past events cannot change our
ruling. And such testimony cannot affect how the Supreme Court will
rule. We also believe, for the reasons stated in our opinion of
July 7, 1998, that the Justice Department's likelihood of success
before the Supreme Court is insufficient to warrant further delay
in the grand jury's investigation.

   People who know better often tell us to slow down, to savor the
small moments with our children.
</P>
<P>
   Right, we say. We'll savor after swimming lessons, soccer
practice, groceries and a stop at the video store.
</P>
<P>
   Those people would love it if we all read ``You're Just What I
Need,'' a deceptively simple tale of a busy mother and her small
child, who is working very hard, too _ at hiding under a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   In the gentle game of hide-and-seek that ensues, the mother
guesses what might be under that ``strange bundle'' on the bed, and
the bundle denies everything. It's not laundry; the mother doesn't
need any more of that. It's not a bunch of carrots. A monkey? A
mop? ``No, no, no, no, no, no, NO,'' the bundle replies, with its
hair peeking out.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-as-a-blush illustrations by Julia Noonan are perfect
for the warm-fuzzy feeling of the book, which serves as a gentle
reminder of what's really important: the little everyday stuff that
memories are made of.

HELPFUL HINTS ON SURVIVING ROAD TRIPS

   An eight-hour trip, three kids and one back seat. ... Let me see
that calculator. This isn't adding up at ALL.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a savvy summer traveler, you know that this kind of
situation takes planning. Serious planning. But there are things
you just can't plan for, such as a sensitive 9-year-old, an
assertive 7-year-old and a wiggly 5-year-old together for what
seems like forever.
</P>
<P>
   Picture books, coloring books and crayons (remember, it'll get
hot in that minivan when you stop for burgers) will take you only
so far. If you've waited this long to take your summer vacation,
you deserve a break. So why don't you try ...

   CHILDREN'S BOOKS ON TAPE
</P>
<P>
   Sing-along tapes are great (try Disney's ``Animal Songs
Sing-Along Wild Safari''), but if it's only a matter of minutes or
miles before the adult behind the wheel lodges a complaint, you
could try a less perky route: audio books. For the younger set, try
``Arthur,'' Chapter Books: Volume 1 ($15.95, Listening Library,
approximate playing time two hours). For something older kids AND
adults will enjoy, check out ``The Indian in the Cupboard''
($19.95, Listening Library, four hours and 22 minutes). A great
choice for a mother/daughter trip would be the audio version of
Judy Blume's classic ``Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret''
($15.95, Listening Library, two hours and nine minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL BOOKS FOR KIDS
</P>
<P>
   If your kids can read in the car without throwing up, kiss them
now and encourage them on the road with some travel-related books,
such as Scholastic's ``The Kids' Book of the 50 Great States.''
</P>
<P>
   If you love trivia, pack the latest edition of Sandra and Harry
Choron's ``The Book of Lists for Kids'' ($9.95, Houghton Miflin
Co.). Older kids will find stuff to laugh about and share with
younger seatmates, and you'll be ready to amuse your friends at
that next dinner party. Do you know the 10 most requested karaoke
songs in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   GAMES GALORE
</P>
<P>
   One look at ``The Amazing Backseat Book-a-ma-Thing'' (billed as
``Thousands of Miles' Worth of Hands-On Games and Activities'') and
you get the feeling the folks at Klutz Press have been down this
road before _ and survived.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots and lots of games here: sane ones such as penny
races, a ``magic writer'' pad for games of Hangman, fold-it-up
paper puzzles, and wackier ones like reading your seatmate's head
bumps or reciting a ``scratch my back'' story (although that last
one sounds like a good recipe for the ``Did I hurt you? Oh, I'm
soooooooo sorry'' fight.)
</P>
<P>
   Klutz also delivers with two RealWorld Guides _ Glove
Compartment Games and Glove Compartment Scavenger Hunt. These
durable (they're laminated), cheap (they're $4.95), little guides
are hard to beat. Games includes the parental favorite ``Name That
Tune,'' but the guides have more than a dozen other suggestions,
including ``Deep Questions'' for those admittedly rare
philosophical moments.
</P>
<P>
   You might also try Family Fun's Games on the Go ($9.95,
Hyperion), which includes suggestions for things to do the whole
trip through, such as the ``Postcards to Me'' activity, in which
kids write and mail postcards to themselves and then bind them
together when they get home for a unique souvenir.

JOHN BIRCH SOCIETY IS NAMED AFTER MISSIONARY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: How did the John Birch Society get its name? _ J.S., Stuart,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A: When a group led by Robert Welch founded the society in 1958,
they took the name of Capt. John Birch, a Christian missionary
killed in China 10 days after the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Birch went to China in 1940 to fight communism, and he assisted
U.S. military efforts against Japan during the war. He died at age
26 after being shot by Chinese communists, according to the John
Birch Society World Wide Web site at www.jbs.org.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we rediscover some of our sounder spiritual values in the
example of his life ... and learn essential truths about our enemy
from the lesson of his murder, then his death at 26 ceases to be a
tragedy,'' Welch states on the site.

<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Bill Pullman? _ T.S., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Pullman in care of United Talent Agency, 9560
Wilshire Blvd., Suite 500, Beverly Hills, CA 90212.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-year-old actor recently finished work on his 34th film,
``Brokedown Palace,'' with Claire Danes and Lou Diamond Phillips.
The movie is about two vacationing women who are arrested for
smuggling in Thailand.

FESTINA COACH SUSPENDED FROM BICYCLE RACING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATEAUROUX, France _ The international governing body of
bicycle racing suspended the coach of the top-ranked Festina team
Thursday after he was taken into police custody in connection with
a drug scandal that threatens to overwhelm the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   The coach, Bruno Roussel, a 41-year-old Frenchman, has been
accused by a Festina worker of ordering him to bring illegal
performance-enhancing drugs to the start of the race last week in
Ireland. The worker was arrested last Wednesday at the
French-Belgian border after his official team car was found to
contain large, but so far unannounced amounts, of illicit drugs
including amphetamines, steroids, masking drugs and erythropoietin,
also known as EPO.
</P>
<P>
   Anabolic steroids, which are used to add muscle mass and aid
recovery from strenuous workouts, have side effects ranging from
severe acne to heart and liver disease. EPO is a genetically
engineered copy of a hormone produced in the kidney that regulates
the production of red blood cells and is suspected to be in wide
use in endurance sports such as bicycle racing and cross-country
skiing. The drug has been linked to more than a dozen deaths by
heart attacks among amateur and professional riders in recent years
because it thickens the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Roussel was held by the police late Wednesday after a few hours
of questioning in the town of Cholet, where the three-week Tour de
France completed its fourth daily stage. Also being held is the
team's doctor, Eric Ryckaert, a 52-year-old Belgian. They were not
formally arrested but under French law can be held for 96 hours and
are expected to be questioned further in the northern city of
Lille, where the case is being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   No action was taken against the nine Festina riders in the race.
They include Laurent Brochard, the world road race champion, and
Richard Virenque, the race's top climber the last four years and
the second-ranked competitor in the last Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``This affair has shaken the confidence of the public and
disturbed the riders,'' said Jean Marie Leblanc, director of the
Tour, at a news conference Thursday morning as the suspension was
announced. ``We hope that from this moment, sport will return to
its rightful priority in the Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   At his side was Martin Bruin, the race's chief commissaire, or
judge, representing the International Cycling Union, which
suspended Roussel's license ``provisionally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That means for the time being,'' Bruin said when pressed for
more details about the suspension. ``Other than that, the official
comment is that there is no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   The cycling union cited Roussel's failure to respond in writing
by Tuesday afternoon to questions it had raised.
</P>
<P>
   Those questions concerned the arrest last week of Willy Voet,
53, a Festina soigneur, or masseur. First, Voet reportedly told the
French police that the drugs were for his personal use but later
told them that he was taking the drugs, under team orders, to the
Festina doctor in Dublin, Ireland, where the 85th Tour began
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Roussel and Ryckaert have both denied Voet's accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a drawn Leblanc said, ``There are sufficiently
grave conditions'' to suspend Roussel's license.
</P>
<P>
   Leblanc, 54, was a professional rider himself at the time of the
Tour's biggest drug affair, the death in 1967 of British rider Tom
Simpson during a climb on Mont Ventoux in France. Amphetamines were
blamed when Simpson overheated during the stage and suffered a
fatal heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Tour's last major doping scandal occurred in 1988, when the
race leader, Pedro Delgado, a Spaniard, failed a drug test because
he had used a masking agent for steroids. Delgado was allowed to
continue to triumph in Paris because although the drug was illegal
under most standards it was not yet in violation of cycling union
rules.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Four riders _ the stage winner, the runner-up and two men chosen
at random _ are tested for drugs each day in the Tour. There have
been no announced failures in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from testing that is conducted during the Tour, bicycle
officials have made spot checks of the levels of red blood cells in
riders over the last two years, suspending for two weeks anybody
whose level is abnormally high. Nearly a dozEn riders were
penalized last year and about half a dozen so far this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Tour director said that he had talked by phone Thursday
morning with Hein Verbruggen, the head of the cycling union, which
is meeting in Havana and that Verbruggen had been ``disturbed by
press coverage of the affair and the image it is giving to the
Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach's suspension was announced in Cholet Thursday as a
cold drizzle fell before the start of the fifth stage, which was
won by Mario Cipollini, an Italian who rides for the Saeco team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's fair,'' said Patrick Lefevere, he coach of
the Mapei team, which is ranked just below Festina in the
computerized team standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he ordered the soigneur to do this, he's guilty,'' Lefevere
said. ``But if the soigneur was trafficking in drugs and the coach
didn't know about it, he's not guilty. And in that case there's a
lot of damage for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Weltz, coach of the U.S. Postal Service team, said,
''It's hard to figure out what's the real story. He has his legal
rights, but the UCI may know something we don't and that's why they
acted.''
</P>
<P>
   Festina riders were supportive of Roussel and somewhat defiant.
Virenque, a Frenchman who is among the favorites before the finish
in Paris on Aug. 2, said: ``We're here to win the Tour de France,
and we'll continue to ride to do so. We're not here to discuss
doping. I'll answer questions about the stage Thursday but not
about this affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil Stephens, an Australian with Festina, was more forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team is pretty depressed,'' he said. ``Bruno said a couple
of days ago he wanted to go to the court, he wanted to talk. He
said he's got nothing to hide, he wanted to get everything out of
the way.''

CLINTON PUSHES PATIENTS' RIGHTS AS HOUSE REPUBLICANS SQUABBLE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton traveled to Capitol Hill on
Thursday to champion patients' rights, declaring to a crowd of
doctors and Democratic colleagues that a patient's right to sue
should be a cornerstone of managed care legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expressed reservations about the Senate Republican
proposal released on Wednesday. The House has a separate proposal,
of which some specifics were disclosed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the president criticized those proposals, Republicans
squabbled among themselves, with some disagreeing over the extent
of legal protections that should be afforded to patients and
whether the proposals would fuel rising health costs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Republican plans, and the Senate one in
particular, would not cover enough people, and left too much up to
the states. The problems, he said, required national legislation
and demanded stronger enforcement than an appeals review panel
could provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will come to us and they say, `OK we'll be for all
the substantive positions in your bill or most of them, as long as
you don't give the patients a right to sue, or some other
enforceable legal right,' '' Clinton said. ``You can write all the
guarantees you want into the law here in Washington, and if nobody
can enforce them, the delay in the system will still cause people
to die. We have to do something about this.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, across town, House Republicans gathered under
a tent in front of the emergency room at George Washington
University Hospital to release specifics on their own managed care
bill. The House Republican bill, while not as far-reaching as the
Democratic bill, extends more patient protections to more people
than its Senate Republican counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to echo what the president said,'' House Speaker Newt
Gingrich said as a group of doctors and nurses listened. ``This
should be a bipartisan issue.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as patients' legal rights, however, Gingrich said, ``We
believe external panels of medical specialists are better than
trial lawyers'' in resolving claims disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gingrich's rousing endorsement, the House bill appears
to have splintered Republicans, some of whom believe it either goes
too far and runs the risk of increasing the cost of insurance, or
it does not go far enough to protect patients.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa, who has been a co-sponsor of the
Democratic bill, announced Thursday that he would resign from the
National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. Ganske
said his push for patient protections had created ``dissension'' in
the Republican conference.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., who is chairman of the House
Oversight Committee and a member of the Republicans' managed care
study group, dropped his support of the House Republican bill after
a stormy meeting with colleagues late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas got into a heated dispute over several provisions with
Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., who helped galvanize support for
patients' rights. In the end, Norwood won out for stronger patient
protections. Thomas objected, and abruptly left the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats should take no joy from the fact that I am not
co-sponsoring the Republican bill because I am adamantly opposed to
the Democrats' bill and will work to defeat it,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Democratic bill would give all consumers the right to
collect damages from managed care companies, the Republicans
propose beefing up the appeals process. They also advocate several
fixes, similar to those in the Democratic bill, which would improve
access to emergency care, to doctors outside HMO plans and to
obstetricians and gynecologists, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   But the House and Senate Republican plans diverge on a major
point: The House plan, like the Democratic bill, would extend those
protections to the 150 million people in employer-sponsored
federally regulated plans. The Senate version would provide most of
those protections to one-third that number.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans say that the two-thirds _ or 100 million
people _ would be protected by state laws, which vary depending on
the state. But Democrats say state laws are inconsistent. ``We have
gone to great lengths not to trample on the states,'' said Oklahoma
Sen. Don Nickles, the second-ranking Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office released figures Thursday on the
Democratic proposal. The bill would cost an estimated $500 million
and result in a loss of $4.6 billion in revenue over the next five
years. Democrats contend the increase would cost the average
employee $2 extra a month.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The US Court of Appeals rejected an urgent request
from the Clinton administration Thursday to block Independent
Counsel Kenneth W. Starr from summoning the president's closest
bodyguards before a federal grand jury, leaving only the Supreme
Court to decide whether to intervene in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Chief Justice William Rehnquist steps in by noon Friday,
a temporary stay preventing members of the Secret Service from
testifying will lapse, and the agents will be called before the
grand jury investigating the Monica S. Lewinsky allegations as
early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials filed a request with Rehnquist
Thursday afternoon asking that he extend the stay until the entire
Supreme Court can hear an appeal in the autumn.
</P>
<P>
   That request capped a day of high drama on the case, as the
legal chess match unfolding between the Clinton administration and
Starr's office took on the urgency of an old-fashioned duel. At one
point Thursday morning, Secret Service Agent Larry Cockell, the
head of President Clinton's protective detail, sat with several
uniformed officers outside the grand jury room waiting to testify,
as Justice Department lawyers won an emergency reprieve from a
panel of appellate judges.
</P>
<P>
   But that victory proved short-lived. By early afternoon, the
full appellate court issued a decision saying it would let stand a
federal judge's prior to ruling that the agents must testify, and
set noon Friday for the stay to lapse.
</P>
<P>
   All nine judges ruling in the case also took pains to note that
they believed the decision would not be overturned, saying in their
order, ``The Justice Department's likelihood of success before the
Supreme Court is insufficient to warrant further delay in the grand
jury's investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   In a strongly worded decision, one of the judges even chided
Clinton and the Justice Department for pushing the case this far,
describing the administration's argument of a special privilege for
Secret Service agents to avoid testifying as a ``constitutional
absurdity.''
</P>
<P>
   That judge, Lawrence Silberman, also chastised Attorney General
Janet Reno for representing the interests of the president over
those of the nation in fighting the independent counsel on the
Secret Service issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general is, in effect, acting as the president's
counsel under the false guise of representing the United States,''
wrote Silberman, an appointee of former President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am mindful of the terrible political pressures and strains
of conscience that bear upon senior political appointees of the
Justice Department when an independent counsel is investigating the
president of the United States,'' Silberman wrote. ``Those strains
are surely exacerbated when the president's agents literally and
figuratively `declare war' on the independent counsel (can it be
said that the president of the United States has declared war on
the United States?).''
</P>
<P>
   Silberman added that federal law ``limits the options that the
attorney general can legally (and honorably) pursue. Litigating
against the independent counsel is not one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Michael McCurry disputed Silberman's
assertion that Clinton allies had declared war on Starr, saying,
``War is a very precise term of art around here, and the commander
in chief takes that seriously. We are not at war with Ken Starr,
but we have some serious disagreements with him, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Jan. 25, in the frantic days just after allegations
surfaced that Clinton had a sexual relationship with Lewinsky, a
former White House intern, and urged her to lie about it, James
Carville, one of Clinton's strategists, explicitly said that he
would wage war with the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be war,'' Carville said on NBC's ``Meet the
Press.'' ``The friends of the president are disgusted by these
kinds of tactics, and we're going to fight, and we're going to
fight very hard to defend the president.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, since Starr first issued subpoenas to three Secret
Service employees, officials from the Treasury Department, which
oversees the Secret Service, and the Justice Department have argued
that agents should not be allowed to testify against the president
they are charged to protect.
</P>
<P>
   By allowing such testimony, those officials argued, the court
would be endangering the president, because Clinton and future
presidents would then try to distance themselves from agents in
pursuit of privacy, and in doing so put themselves in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   The White House again sought Thursday to distance itself from
the appeals in this case. McCurry repeatedly referred all questions
to the Justice Department and the Secret Service. Spokesmen for
both agencies failed to return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we have stated before, the attorney general and the
secretary of the Treasury have made their decisions on how to
proceed in this matter with complete independence, guided by the
advice of career law enforcement professionals,'' White House
counsel Charles F.C. Ruff said in a written statement. ``They have
only one interest _ to ensure that the Secret Service is able to
perform its vitally important duties.''
</P>
<P>
   One stated fear among Clinton's battery of lawyers is that Starr
is planning to question Cockell about conversations between Clinton
and Robert Bennett, the president's attorney in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment. Cockell was reportedly in the limousine with
Clinton and Bennett on the ride back to the White House from
Clinton's deposition with Jones's lawyers in January, when he was
first asked about the nature of his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rehnquist, an appointee of former President Nixon and
the last remaining justice from the court that handed Nixon a
devastating legal blow in 1974 on the issue of executive privilege,
was flying back to the United States from an official trip to
Europe Thursday. Rehnquist had recused himself from the unanimous
vote against Nixon. Supreme Court officials said late Thursday the
chief justice would not make any decision until this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist first must decide whether to grant or deny the Clinton
administration's request for a temporary stay that would continue
to block the agents' testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice could decide on his own or refer the issue to
the full court, which reconvenes in October. If Rehnquist acts
alone and rejects the stay, the administration could take the case
to another of the eight justices.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department also filed a formal appeal asking the
Supreme Court to review the appeals court decision.
</P>
<P>
   At the federal courthouse in downtown Washington Thursday,
Cockell and the other agents arrived and left grim-faced, unsure of
their status as they were pulled in different directions in the
legal battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``As law enforcement officers here or anywhere, they'd like to
know what their duty is before they are doing it,'' said Mike
Leibig, an attorney for the agents. ``And some of the ambiguity is
what they're concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Cockell was temporarily replaced as the lead agent on
Clinton's security detail, largely out of concern that he was too
distracted to properly do his job, according to a Secret Service
official who declined to be named. That decision was reached by
Cockell and the director of the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   Another worry among Secret Service officials was that reporters
would yell questions to Cockell while he was guarding the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Said the official: ``We like to blend into the woodwork. Even
though everyone sees us, we don't like to be the issue. Now we're
the issue. This is the first time when it's been disruptive.''

CUBAN EXILE GROUP'S LEADERS PLAN LAWSUIT AGAINST NEW YORK TIMES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leaders of a Miami-based Cuban exile group
announced Thursday that they intended to file a lawsuit against The
New York Times, saying the newspaper published ``outrageous and
malicious'' allegations linking the group's founder to a bombing
campaign in Cuba last year aimed at toppling Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   In the articles, a militant Cuban exile named Luis Posada
Carilles was quoted as claiming responsibility for organizing a
wave of bombings last year at Cuban hotels, restaurants and
discotheques that killed an Italian tourist and alarmed the Cuban
government. Posada also claimed that he had received financial
support from leaders of the Cuban American National Foundation,
including its founder, Jorge Mas Canosa, who died last year.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here, Jorge Mas Santos, Mas' son and the
group's director, adamantly denied that his father or the
foundation had supported any of Posada's efforts. Mas Santos
demanded that The Times' immediately publish a retraction, saying
the foundation and its leaders had relied solely on lawful and
peaceful means to try to bring down Cuba's Communist government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York Times slandered, and The New York Times lied,''
Mas Santos said at the news conference in the First Amendment Room
at the National Press Club. ``These articles are offensive,
slanderous and defamatory.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, The Times ``reiterated its complete support and
confidence'' in the two-part series, which was published on July 12
and 13 and written by Ann Louise Bardach, a contract writer for the
newspaper, and Larry Rohter, its Caribbean correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their articles are based on more than 100 different sources,''
The Times said. ``Both reporters met Posada and were assisted by a
dozen New York Times editors, researchers and lawyers in
preparation for publication.''
</P>
<P>
   The reporters conducted 13 hours of interviews with Posada, 70,
over two days at a walled Caribbean compound. The quotations from
Posada in the articles were transcribed from tape recordings. Nancy
Nielsen, a spokeswoman for the newspaper, said Thursday, ``The
Cuban American National Foundation has pointed to nothing in The
Times' stories that warrants a retraction or correction in our
view.''
</P>
<P>
   George J. Fowler 3d, the lawyer for the foundation, said it had
not been decided where and when the lawsuit would be filed. He also
did not say what allegations would be the basis for the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with a Miami Spanish-language television
station, Posada recently recanted some statements that he had made
to The Times. In the interview, televised Monday night, Posada said
it was ``completely false'' that Mas Canosa had provided him with
financial and logistical support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a lie,'' he told WLTV-Channel 23 in Miami. ``They have
never sent me money, none of the officers of the Foundation.'' A
tape of the interview, in Spanish, was played at Thursday's news
conference, and at a news conference held on Monday at the
foundation's headquarters in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Posada also told the television station that he had not spoken
with Mas for eight or 10 years, but he had told The Times that he
spoke with him shortly before his death. ``This man professed to
have spoken with my father a month before his death, when my father
was on an artificial respirator fighting for his life,'' Mas Santos
said.

REPORTS OF EMBEZZLING AT WORLD BANK JEOPARDIZE U.S. FINANCING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky.)  (lh) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A key member of Congress said Thursday that
financing for some of the World Bank's poverty-fighting efforts had
been put in jeopardy by reports that bank employees were suspected
of embezzlement and of accepting kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee's foreign operations subcommittee, said in
a letter to James D. Wolfensohn, the World Bank's president, that
he found news reports of possible wrongdoing uncovered by the
bank's internal investigation ``shocking.'' He said that it was
time for an independent review of the institution's management and
operations.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell's subcommittee was scheduled to vote next week on
providing $800 million for next year to the arm of the World Bank
that makes low-interest loans to the world's poorest countries. His
aides said he probably would write the bill to require a full
explanation of the reports of wrongdoing and the bank's failure to
apprise Congress of the problem before he released the money.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell's letter came after newspapers reported that the bank
had found evidence of kickbacks being funneled to employees in at
least two cases, and was investigating other accusations as part of
a broad inquiry into wrongdoing within the bank. The bank's
investigations were first disclosed by the Washington Post and the
Asahi Shimbun in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   When compared to the billions of dollars that the institution
routinely lends to rickety, poor and sometimes corrupt governments
around the world, the two cases at the center of the bank's
investigations are minuscule in financial terms.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, World Bank officials are investigating whether two
Japanese employees took $11,000 in kickbacks for steering a
consulting contract to a subsidiary of a Japanese securities firm.
</P>
<P>
   In the only other case to have progressed beyond the initial
stages of investigation, the bank filed a civil lawsuit seeking to
recover tens of thousands of dollars it suspects were funneled to
an employee by a technology company he hired to work on a project
in Algeria. No criminal charges have been filed in either case.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who follow the World Bank generally see internal
corruption as a far-smaller problem than the bank's attempt to
wrest full control over the more than $20 billion it channels each
year into construction projects, education, health and nutrition
projects and other programs in scores of countries across the
world.
</P>
<P>
   But since the institution has embarked on a high-profile effort
to ensure that the money it lends goes to fighting poverty and not
to enriching corrupt government officials and business executives,
officials at the bank were concerned that the institution be able
to live up to its own standards,
</P>
<P>
   And with the bank's poverty-fighting effectiveness under attack
in Congress and internationally among economists and development
specialists, the investigations brought more criticism that the
bank is not sufficiently accountable to taxpayers in the United
States and other wealthy nations that help finance its operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department said it had encouraged the bank to
``investigate fully and then take all appropriate actions.''

U.S. DRUG CHIEF VISITS LIBERAL DUTCH PROGRAM  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARLISE SIMONS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands _ The Netherlands had its jaw tightly set
Thursday for the arrival of Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the outspoken
commander of the American war on drugs. Several days ago the
general prepared for his visit by dealing a few public punches
against the Dutch and their tolerance for narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey is on an eight-day tour of European cities, looking at
how Europeans fight and cope with drugs. That includes the
Netherlands, which more than any other country has painstakingly
developed a division between ``soft'' and ``hard'' drugs. It is
where over the counter one can buy small bags of ``space cake,''
``northern light'' or ``zeropolm,'' all forms of marijuana, and not
go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch policy to disconnect cannabis from the criminal
underground of so-called hard drugs by allowing small quantities of
marijuana to be sold in cafes has earned it the envy of some
countries and the derision of others. McCaffrey has made it clear
that he belongs to the critics.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days he has called the permissive Dutch policy ``an
unmitigated disaster.'' He further said, mistakenly, that the Dutch
murder rate far outstripped that of the United States, and his
office issued a statement that all but scolded the Dutch
government.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials expressed their annoyance publicly. The
foreign minister called in the American ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   The fracas has made the general the talk of the nation, not just
in government offices, but also in the ``soft drug'' bars. One
newspaper headline returned the criticism, saying it was the
general who was ``an unmitigated disaster'' for drug policy.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday returned to more conventional diplomacy by praising his
hosts and saying that he had gained valuable insights from meetings
with the police, doctors, social workers and policy makers in
several cities. He said he had appreciated the chance to learn of
experiments in treating heroin and cocaine addicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to listen and see what I can borrow,'' the general
said. ``Most important for me is to discover how to use methadone
as a tool to deal with heroin addiction. The Dutch have 20 years of
experience doing that, and we want to watch that carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Programs to treat addicts are more thorough in the Netherlands
than in the United States, McCaffrey said. And Dutch treatment
projects ``also have a much higher rate of contact with addicts
than we have,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey visited a pilot project in Rotterdam where heroin
addicts in a supervised center receive free heroin in an effort to
reduce drug-related crimes and reduce their exposure to HIV. But
the general clearly disapproved of such projects, which are also
under way in other European countries, including Switzerland and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Supplying heroin may reduce crimes and AIDS rates, he said, but
the users remain addicts, marginalized from society and, perhaps,
discouraged from joining methadone programs.
</P>
<P>
   The general did not visit any of the 800 or so cafes that the
country licenses to sell marijuana and hashish in small quantities
for private use. An aide said he was convinced that they were
dangerous for young people, because they made drug use seem normal.
Besides, the aide said, the general would not want to glamorize
such places.

BLUE CROSS OF ILLINOIS TO PAY $144 MILLION FOR DEFRAUDING
MEDICARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois pleaded
guilty Thursday to defrauding Medicare and agreed to pay $144
million in civil and criminal penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The company admitted that it had concealed evidence of its poor
performance in reviewing and paying claims of Medicare
beneficiaries in Illinois and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The plea agreement is the latest result of a federal crackdown
on fraud and abuse in the Medicare program, which provides health
care coverage for 38 million elderly or disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, also known as the Health
Care Service Corp., agreed to pay $4 million in criminal fines. It
will also pay $140 million in a civil settlement of charges under
the False Claims Act.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said the agreement was ``the
largest settlement ever with a Medicare contractor.''
</P>
<P>
   The company ``falsified its own performance records, and in some
cases simply paid the Medicare claims without even reviewing
them,'' Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, one of several dozen
companies that review and pay Medicare claims for the government,
admitted that it had obstructed the work of federal auditors,
creating a ``false appearance of superior performance'' in its
Medicare work. The company admitted that it had falsified and
destroyed records in an effort to deceive federal auditors
evaluating its performance.
</P>
<P>
   In a plea agreement filed Thursday in the federal court in East
St. Louis, Ill., Blue Cross and Blue Shield pleaded guilty to six
counts of making false statements to the government, one count of
conspiracy and one count of trying to obstruct federal auditors.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been a Medicare contractor since 1983. Other
companies are taking over its work for the government.
</P>
<P>
   June Gibbs Brown, the inspector general of the Department of
Health and Human Services, said: ``Medicare fraud and abuse is
always a serious matter, but it's particularly grievous when the
abuse involves a contractor entrusted to protect the financial
integrity of the program. In this case, that trust was flagrantly
violated by a prestigious, nationally known company. It engaged in
unconscionable conduct that adversely affected Medicare
beneficiaries, providers and the program itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kieckhefer, a spokesman for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
Illinois, said the company had cooperated with the federal
investigation. He said the misconduct involved ``a few employees in
one office.'' But the plea agreement says that managers and
supervisors were also involved.
</P>
<P>
   The case stems from accusations against Blue Cross and Blue
Shield by a company employee who invoked the False Claims Act. The
law, adopted during the Civil War, creates an incentive for
citizens to report defrauding of the government. Under the law, a
``whistle-blower'' can receive 15 percent to 25 percent of damages
paid to the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said that the employee in the Illinois
case, Evelyn Knoob, would receive $21 million at the time of the
final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Thursday night at her home in Illinois, Mrs. Knoob said
she had been instructed by her lawyer not to discuss her case. But
she seemed uncertain whether she would receive the money. ``What
they say and what's true are not necessarily the same,'' she
commented.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The American Hospital Association and many health care providers
have been lobbying Congress to repeal or water down major
provisions of the False Claims Act. They say the government has
harassed hospitals in its investigations of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said the False Claims Act was
``the government's most effective tool against health care fraud.''
And he said the hospital association had made ``an unconscionable
assault'' on the law this year, organizing a grass-roots campaign
to weaken the statute.
</P>
<P>
   The association tried to sway lawmakers with ``horror stories''
from hospitals around the country, Grassley said, but the efforts
failed to persuade Congress because they ``lacked an essential
ingredient _ credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospital association Richard Wade said more than 200 members of
Congress had signed up as co-sponsors of a bill to rewrite the
False Claims Act, showing that the hospitals' arguments have merit.
</P>
<P>
   Holder said most of the money recovered from Blue Cross and Blue
Shield would go into the Medicare trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown, the inspector general, said that in the last five
years other Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, in Florida,
Massachusetts, Michigan and California, had paid millions of
dollars in penalties to settle federal charges of submitting false
information to the government.

SWEENEY URGES VOTE FOR PRO-HEALTH REFORM CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ AFL-CIO president John Sweeney Thursday urged a crowd
of local workers to elect congressional leaders who will help to
reform health care.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a public forum at the Boston Medical Center, one of
a series of talks the union leader has held in various states this
year, Sweeney told about 100 people that the number of uninsured in
the United States rose from 35 million five years ago to more than
40 million today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no secret that since we failed to pass a national health
care bill we have been on a collision course and the result is a
nightmare for workers and consumers,'' said Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States, no doctor should refuse to care for a
patient, and no health care system should deny care to the sick,''
Sweeney continued. ``The only way to prevent that from happening is
to elect a Congress that will support health care reform.''
</P>
<P>
   One health care worker at the forum said she has worked for a
nursing facility for 14 years, but earns so little she cannot
afford to insure herself.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I haven't received a raise in four years,'' said Sylvia
McLure, a single mother employed at a Brookline nursing home. ``I
can't afford (health insurance) so I've gone all these years
without it ... The Lord's been on my side; I haven't got sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney's visit took place a month after the 13 million-member
AFL-CIO released the findings from a report it had commissioned on
employer-paid health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that between 1989 and 1996, the number of
Americans covered by company-funded insurance plans dropped by 8
million. Of those, 76.4 percent dropped coverage because of a
marked increase in the amount employees are required to contribute
to the company health insurance plan.

SALINAS BROTHERS TIED TO MORE CRIMES; FEW MEXICANS SURPRISED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Downtown peddlers may not sell nearly as many of
the caricature masks of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
as they once did. But nearly four years after he left office, he _
and members of his family _ remain very much connected in the minds
of many Mexicans with corruption and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Although Salinas has never been formally accused of a crime,
many of the people around him have been charged with wrongdoing,
and some have been convicted.
</P>
<P>
   In just the last few days, an arrest warrant was issued for
Salinas' former personal secretary, who is charged with not being
able to explain how, as a public servant, he was able to accumulate
millions of dollars in several bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Also this week, federal prosecutors arrested the personal
accountant of Salinas' elder brother Raul on the same charge,
illicit enrichment. The accountant is charged with having used his
own name to hide houses and other properties purchased by Raul
Salinas, who is in a maximum security jail outside Mexico City on
charges of illicit enrichment and homicide.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday a federal judge sentenced Raul Salinas' wife to two
years in prison for pressuring their driver and handyman to lie
when called to testify in the homicide proceedings against her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Salinas name still conjures negative images and outright
hatred,'' said Sergio Sarmiento, a prominent Mexico City columnist
and television news director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you want to accuse someone in Mexico of being
dishonest or anything else negative, you just have to say he was a
friend of Salinas and you don't need to say any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarmiento said he has had to withstand such accusations himself
after writing unpopular columns, even though he only met the former
president twice.
</P>
<P>
   The Salinas name appears in newspapers practically every day,
even though the former president and his older brother are almost
never seen in public.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Salinas lives in Dublin in a kind of self-imposed exile.
Occasionally he issues a statement by fax through his lawyers or
grants a limited interview.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he left office in disgrace, the rubber masks
appeared on the streets of Mexico. Street vendors did a brisk
business for a while, but the market seems to have evaporated. Now
they are more often used for comic effect by street performers who
swallow fire or build human pyramids.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Salinas has been in prison since he was arrested in Mexico
City in February 1995 and charged with having planned and ordered
the murder of his former brother-in-law, Jose Francisco Ruiz
Massieu. Ruiz Massieu had been married to the Salinas' sister,
Adriana, but they divorced. He was secretary general of the
long-dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party and was gunned down
in Mexico City in September 1994.
</P>
<P>
   While in jail Raul Salinas sent his wife, Paulina, to
Switzerland to try to withdraw some of the $130 million he had in
banks there, some in the name of his accountant, Juan Manuel Gomez
Gutierrez. Swiss authorities blocked her, and since then have said
they believe the money is linked to the illegal drug trade. They
have said they expect to bring charges against Raul Salinas soon.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials confirmed Thursday that they had arrested
Gomez Gutierrez in Ciudad Juarez, near the U.S. border, on
Wednesday. He faces charges of helping Raul Salinas hide his
fortune, and was released Thursday on $70,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also say they have issued an arrest warrant
against the former president's personal secretary, Justo Ceja
Martinez. The newspaper El Universal reported Thursday that
prosecutors say that during the years Ceja handled the president's
personal affairs, from 1988 to 1994, he was able to amass more than
$3 million at Thursday's exchange rate _ even though his salary was
less than $2,700 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also believe that Ceja had a close relationship to
Adrian Carrera Fuentes, the former head of the Mexican national
police, who recently testified before a federal grand jury in the
United States about drug bribes to ranking members of the Salinas
administration.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GALLIPOLI, Turkey _ Here at the place where half a million men
fell during one of the fiercest battles of World War I, the Turkish
government is planning to open a ``peace park'' dedicated to the
memory of the dead and the ideal of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   During the grim days when this spit of land was being soaked in
blood during the 1915 Gallipoli campaign, it must have seemed
inconceivable that it would ever come to symbolize anything besides
carnage and the waste of young lives. But the recent announcement
that a Norwegian team had won an international competition to
design the new park crowns more than half a century of growing
friendship among the nations whose soldiers died here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Norwegian entry is very subtle,'' said Raci Bademli, a
professor of urban planning at Middle East Technical University in
Ankara, who coordinated the design competition. ``It is not
intrusive, and does not include any large buildings. Instead it is
based on footpaths that take visitors around the site and create a
kind of story for each individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will also be small niches that give visitors a chance to
think or speculate or reflect on what they are seeing and what it
means for the idea of world peace. Everything is in harmony with
the existing topography.''
</P>
<P>
   Bademli said he was pleased that a Norwegian team had won the
design competition. Because Norway was not involved in the
Gallipoli battle, he said, Norwegian planners would come to the
project without national preconceptions and would be drawn to the
universal aspects of the human tragedy that was played out here.
</P>
<P>
   The Gallipoli peninsula was declared a national park in 1973,
but since then a number of illegal structures have been built on
beaches where Allied troops landed and around nearby villages. The
largest of the villages, Gelibolu, is known in English as Gallipoli
and gave its name to the military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the peace park envision removal of these structures
and an end to forestry operations that have sprung up. Most of the
work is to be finished by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it stands today, Gallipoli inspires awe and reverence.
There are 31 cemeteries here, but many of those who died lie in
unmarked mass graves. Since most of the fighting took place in an
area only a couple of square miles in size, almost everywhere a
visitor treads is likely to be a soldier's grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trooper G.R. Seager,'' reads the simple gravestone of an
Australian soldier. ``7 August 1915. Age 17. He Died a Man &AMP; Closed
His Life's Brief Day Ere It Had Scarce Begun.''
</P>
<P>
   The assault on Gallipoli was planned by First Lord of the
Admiralty Winston Churchill and other British strategists as a way
of opening the disputed Dardanelles straits to Allied warships.
They planned to use the ships to supply Russia through Black Sea
ports and perhaps ease pressure on France and Belgium by attacking
Austro-Hungary from the east.
</P>
<P>
   Britain was at the height of its imperial power, while the
Ottoman Empire, then allied with Germany and Austro-Hungary, was in
its death throes and widely viewed as impotent. But the invading
force, which included many soldiers from Australia and New Zealand,
found Turkish defenders astonishingly tenacious and willing to take
staggering casualties.
</P>
<P>
   For most of 1915, both sides fought from trenches that were
often less than 10 yards apart. Finally the invaders were forced to
withdraw in defeat, many of them recording in letters and diaries
their new-found respect for Turkish fighting men.
</P>
<P>
   Not least among the results of the campaign was the emergence of
a young Turkish officer who went on to found the Turkish Republic,
Kemal Ataturk.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, while he was president of the republic, he learned that
a group from Britain, Australia and New Zealand was visiting the
site, and sent a remarkable message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those heroes that shed their blood and lost their lives,'' he
wrote, ``you are now lying in the soil of a friendly country.
Therefore rest in peace. There is no difference between the
Johnnies and the Mehmets to us, where they lie side by side here in
this country of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You, the mothers who sent their sons from faraway countries,
wipe away your tears. Your sons are now lying in our bosom and are
in peace. After having lost their lives on this land, they have
become our sons as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalists traveling with the group reported this message, and
soon Ataturk's office was flooded with grateful telegrams,
especially from Australia and New Zealand. Today citizens of those
countries visit Gallipoli nearly every day, and cafes seek to
attract them with kangaroo motifs and names like The Aussi} and
Kiwi.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the blood bath here was brought vividly home to a
new generation with the release of Peter Weir's 1981 film
``Gallipoli,'' starring Mel Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the bond that has grown up among onetime
adversaries, former Prime Minister Bill Hayden of Australia said:
``Three modern nations emerged from the Gallipoli campaign: Turkey,
New Zealand and Australia. It helps explain the continuing
significance that it has in our national sentiment.''

 &HT;    Clinton signs bill authorizing King monument on The Mall
 &HT;    By Christy Oglesby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Martin Luther King Jr. could become the first African
American to have a monument erected in his memory on The Mall in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore told delegates at the NAACP convention
Thursday that President Clinton signed a bill that day authorizing
the monument to the slain civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement brought the crowd to its feet with resounding
applause.
</P>
<P>
   Congress approved the measure on June 22. It did not face the
opposition that a federal holiday in King's memory did.
</P>
<P>
   Other monuments on the mall include memorials to Abraham
Lincoln, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Franklin Delano
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   King's fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha, is charged with designing
and raising money for the monument. The last two monuments on The
Mall honor veterans from the Korean and Vietnam wars, were
privately financed and cost $16 million and $17 million
respectively, said U.S. Park Ranger James Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Details about the design, the size, the exact location and even
when the monument will be overseen by the National Capitol Planning
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   There will be an international competition to create the design
of the memorial, which will determine its cost, said Hebrew Dixon,
executive director of Alpha Phi Alpha. The Mall stretches from the
Lincoln Memorial past the Washington Monument to the Capitol.

 &HT;    Vaccine could be ready for testing in 5 years
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Syphilis, the sexually transmitted disease that
has crippled and killed people worldwide for more than 500 years,
soon could be headed for eradication, thanks to breakthrough Texas
research.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, scientists at the University of Texas
Houston Health Science Center have mapped the complete gene
structure of the screw-shaped bacterium that causes syphilis,
opening the door to development within five years of a vaccine to
prevent and possibly eradicate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moved at being able to provide the key to understanding
this age-old scourge,'' said George Weinstock, a UT Houston
microbiologist who led a team that completed the gene blueprint
after two years of cooperative work with federal scientists at The
Institute for Genomic Research in Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can now figure out ways to disarm (the bug's) defenses
through vaccines, identify it quickly through new diagnostic tests
and eliminate it with specific, targeted antibiotics,'' Weinstock
said.
</P>
<P>
   The gene mapping, reported in today's issue of the journal
Science, is expected to lead to all of those things because the map
provides science with its first look at the complete set of
proteins made by the bacterium's 1,041 genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Completion of this project is an extraordinary boost for
efforts to develop a protective vaccine,'' said Dr. Anthony Fauci
director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve of the bug's proteins already are candidates for a
vaccine, which the UT Houston lab and others are working on.
Weinstock said they could have one ready for testing within five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that distinguishes syphilis is that, as far
as we know, (the bug) is truly a human pathogen,'' said Steven
Norris, a UT Houston pathologist and Weinstock's co-investigator.
``There are no animal reservoirs for it. So if you came up with a
vaccine, you would truly have a shot at wiping it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The bacterium, Treponema pallidum, joins 14 other microbes,
including a half-dozen that cause disease, whose genetic structure
has been blueprinted in science's ongoing genetics revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Syphilis has been treatable since the discovery of antibiotics
in this century, but it remains difficult to diagnose. Its initial
symptoms, highly infectious open genital sores, often heal on their
own. It may be a year or more before appearance of the secondary
symptom, a whole-body rash that also heals itself. From there, the
disease is hidden, and unless treated the bug invades the
cardiovascular and nervous systems, causing insanity and death.
Pregnant women with the disease may infect their newborns.
</P>
<P>
   The bacterium long has frustrated researchers trying to
understand how it works because it cannot be grown in laboratory
dishes for easy study. With the new blueprint, pieces of which have
been disseminated in the past few years on the Internet, they now
know why.
</P>
<P>
   The bug ``is metabolically crippled,'' Norris said, requiring it
to steal from its human host the enzymes, fatty acids, even some
building blocks of DNA, necessary for its survival.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston and Maryland researchers beat the problem by
inoculating rabbits with the bacterium, extracting the microbes
weeks later from their tissues, and breaking the genome into small
pieces for mapping.
</P>
<P>
   Syphilis epidemics raged across Europe following its
introduction there in the 1500s after the first adventurers
returned from the newly discovered Americas, where scientists
believe the bug originated. It was a sort of trade for the smallpox
the Europeans brought to the New World. By the 19th century,
syphilis was found worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with the new gene map, Weinstock hopes to examine
pre-Columbian mummies in Latin America for traces of DNA to finally
answer the question of origin.
</P>
<P>
   Today, syphilis is more common in developing countries than in
the United States, where it infects about 9,000 people a year. But
it re-emerges in outbreaks every 10 years or so, and the open
genital sores it causes make its victims vulnerable to the deadlier
AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Syphilis now is in decline in Texas, although there were
outbreaks in Dallas and Beaumont in 1990 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Health recorded 683 cases in 1997, more
than half of them in Dallas and Harris counties. A total of 10
cases were found in Travis, Hays and Williamson counties.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 percent of the 1997 statewide cases were in African
Americans, in whom syphilis is 40 times more prevalent than in
Anglos or Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Health authorities say some African Americans don't seek
treatment for syphilis when it is most treatable because of
distrust generated by the infamous Tuskegee study. In the study
that began in 1932, the forerunner of the U.S. Public Health
Service denied antibiotics to African American men diagnosed with
the disease in order to follow its unimpeded course.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still suspect that has an effect on whether African
Americans will seek medical treatment,'' said Barry Mitchell, with
the epidemiology division of the Texas Department of Health.

 &HT;    White Water owner is known as industry leader
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Long before the E. coli outbreak tarnished the image
of White Water Park, the family that owns the Marietta attraction
had been building a theme park empire from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   Actually from below the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, Hugo Herschend, a branch manager for the Electrolux
vacuum company, decided he wanted to start a family business. He
found his future inside a big cave in Missouri's Ozark Mountain
country. Taking out a 99-year lease, Herschend organized tours and
square dances 500 feet below the surface of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   But his big success came when Herschend decided to hire some
crafts people to perform demonstrations outside the cave and expand
his small investment by putting on some cornball shows such as the
Hatfields feuding with the McCoys. Attendance shot through the
roof, and Silver Dollar City was born. The family's multimillion
dollar corporation now controls 15 theme parks and attractions in
three states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that we had changed the cave business into an
entertainment business,'' said Pete Herschend, one of Hugo's two
sons who now run the family business. He started as a 14-year-old
who cleaned the cave after hard rains, and later met his wife, Jo
Dee, when they were on opposite sides of the feud show.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Atlanta is a major market for Silver Dollar City, which
operates three major enterprises here. In addition to White Water
and American Adventures in Marietta, the company this year took
over operation of the attractions at the state-owned Stone Mountain
Park.
</P>
<P>
   According to many in the theme park world, the company is an
industry leader in providing safe, satisfying entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways they are held out as an example of the right way
to do things,'' said Wally James, chairman of the safety committee
for the World Water Park Association.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Dollar City is a finalist for the top award from
Amusement Business, a weekly trade newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   When it was built in 1984, White Water was one of the country's
first big water theme parks, and it has been responsible for
several innovations in the business. It was reportedly the first to
have a separate children's play area and the first to offer ``dive
in'' movies on a screen beside the wave pool.
</P>
<P>
   So when news broke in June of E. coli striking children who
visited White Water, with several kids hospitalized in critical
condition, the impact was felt to the very top of the corporate
chain. And it hit hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a situation like this hits, when a child is injured, I
get tears,'' said Pete Herschend, who is 64.
</P>
<P>
   He and his company also got busy. ``I know our men and women are
working just as hard as they can to do the right thing,'' he said.
Silver City's response to White Water has been a mixture of
maintenance enhancements, policy revisions, and spin control.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials have acknowledged that chlorine levels in the
pools had several times dipped below the standard set by Cobb
County. But they stress that chlorine levels were quickly raised
and are maintained by equipment that continuously monitors and
adjusts the levels of the bacteria-killing chemical. A $50,000
enhancement unveiled June 29 sounds an alarm to alert staff when
levels are too low or too high.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, plastic, sealed pants are now required and provided
for children using the wading pools.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Silver City flew its corporate director of publicity,
Lisa Rau, to Atlanta, and she has made a point of stressing that
White Water ``is not the source of the E. coli break out. We are
the link.'' The company has hired top experts to help find the
cause, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But pressure is mounting. Since E. coli infections of at least
25 children have been linked to White Water, the Marietta park has
seen attendance drop 30 to 40 percent during what should have been
a profitable hot summer. And a lawyer for the families of two
infected children has asked the company to pay the medical bills
for children who contracted the illness.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Carlock, White Water's attorney, said that subject is under
discussion but it's too early to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Herschend, who runs the company with his 65-year-old brother
Jack, would say only that his company will be reaching out to those
families.
</P>
<P>
   The E. coli outbreak is not the only troublesome health incident
to hit Silver City, but it is the biggest. Three years ago there
was an incident in which 60 people who visited the Marietta park
contracted parasites called cryptosporidium and giardia, both of
which cause severe bouts of diarrhea. In response, White Water took
steps to remove any lingering concern by ``superchlorinating'' its
pools.
</P>
<P>
   The company has sent letters explaining the steps it has taken
in the wake of its current problems, and Herschend is talking about
the company's commitment to communities in which it operates.
Silver Dollar City donated $6.5 million to charities in the past 10
years, said company officials. The Marietta water park has donated
for several years to a Cobb County shelter for abused women and
children, raising about $100,000 for it over 10 years. Dollywood
was recognized by the governor of Tennessee in 1994 for hiring
people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Founder Hugo Herschend's influence remains with the company, his

   Christian values remain the foundation of the company, he said.
``That doesn't mean we only hire certain people, but we try to run

 &HT;    Moms on panel defend White Water
 &HT;    By Virginia Anderson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Their kids' memories will be filled with images of
the pools at White Water, with visions of Little Squirts and
Captain Kid's Cove dancing in their heads.
</P>
<P>
   They are a group of 20 mothers who meet every other Thursday
during the summer at White Water, without pay or free season
passes, to advise White Water on how to be a great family park.
Some have taken their children to White Water as often as five
times a week over the years because they consider it the best
summer entertainment their kids can have.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most family-oriented, caring place I've ever
visited,'' said Anne Ledford, a Cobb mother of three who is one of
the 20 who serves on the park's Moms Board of Directors.
</P>
<P>
   Ledford said she has been saddened at the news of the 25
children who have been infected with E. coli traced to three days
at the park in June and angry at the media for what she perceives
as unfair treatment of the park. A season pass holder for the 11th
straight year, Ledford said she considers the park one of the
safest places her children could play in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   White Water General Manager Sonny Horton said the Moms Board
advises the park on ways to be more family friendly. It also serves
as a trouble-shooting group that aims to be sensitive to mothers,
whom Horton said make the decision about whether to bring kids to
the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look at it through the eyes of the guest,'' Horton said.
``If we change the direction that we put the toilet paper on the
holder, they can tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Recommendations over the board's 13 years have included things
like more diaper changing stations and roping off an area at the
Little Squirts pool so that kids coming down the slide wouldn't
land on little ones already at the base of the slide.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the mothers signed a three-page letter the park mailed
earlier this week to season ticket holders to encourage them to
come back to the park after several weeks of a 30-40 percent
decline in attendance after the E. coli outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak hasn't stopped the board's president, Raye Ann
Raaen, from wearing her White Water T-shirt out in public, even
though she has received a comment or two while wearing it.
</P>
<P>
   The mothers said they are deeply concerned for the families of
the children stricken with E. coli but do not think the park is to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can pick things like that up at the lake,'' Ledford said.
</P>
<P>
   Raaen said some of the fondest memories of her boys, now ages 13
and 15, will be of the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my kids grow up, and they think of summer, they will
think of White Water,'' Raeen said. ``This could have happened
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The group and park management have said they are thinking of and
praying for all the children infected. Two remain hospitalized at
Scottish Rite Children's Medical Center, and a third child _
Matthew Addison, 3 _ was re-admitted to Kosair Children's Hospital
in Louisville, Ky., last weekend but later released.
</P>
<P>
   At Scottish Rite, a 2-year-old girl remains in critical
condition, and a 4-year-old girl is in fair condition, hospital
spokeswoman Kim Lathbury said.

TEXAS A&AMP;M OFFICIALLY LOSES BID TO OFFER LEGAL STUDIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LYDIA LUM 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ State higher education officials formally
rejected Texas A&AMP;M University's bid Thursday to offer legal
studies, firing another shot at A&AMP;M's ties with a private Houston
law school.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M president Ray Bowen said he plans to ask Texas Higher
Education Commissioner Don Brown to reconsider the criteria used to
judge A&AMP;M's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen complained that the Higher Education Coordinating Board
did not properly consider the A&AMP;M-South Texas College of Law
affiliation on Thursday. Too many board members are ``inflexible''
and convinced the law school is becoming state-supported, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unfortunately one of the most misunderstood academic
events in our university's history,'' Bowen said. ``This is simply
an academic degree that we outsourced to a wonderful private law
school. The piece of paper has our name on it, with our control
over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of both schools reiterated their plans to proceed with
various terms of the affiliation, including A&AMP;M naming members to
the South Texas governing board this year as well as the schools
establishing joint academic programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're continuing to strengthen ties between the two
institutions,'' said South Texas law dean Tom Read.
</P>
<P>
   Coordinating Board members voted 15-2 against A&AMP;M's request.
Board members William Atkinson of Bryan and Wendy Marsh of Amarillo
supported A&AMP;M. The board oversees all state-supported universities
and community colleges, approving their academic degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The flap stems from an agreement signed in January between South
Texas and A&AMP;M officials. The law school got A&AMP;M's ``brand-name''
boost while staying in downtown Houston and still charging tuition
of more than $14,000 a year as a private school. The university got
a law school that it has long wanted without buying or building
one.
</P>
<P>
   However, officials of the University of Houston soon accused A&AMP;M
of wrongly skirting the Coordinating Board for approval before
finalizing the South Texas deal. UH officials also labeled the
affiliation a precursor to South Texas becoming state-supported.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the higher education commissioner, repeated his
previously stated opinions when he advised Coordinating Board
members Thursday to turn down A&AMP;M's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M doesn't need a law school to remain a top-ranked university,
Brown said. Also, A&AMP;M's Houston law school efforts ``unnecessarily
duplicate'' those of UH and Texas Southern University, which each
have law schools a few miles from South Texas. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bowen argued Thursday that Coordinating Board members still
had not considered ``the merits of a public-private partnership''
and suggested they postpone their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our case still has yet to be heard,'' Bowen said, referring to
A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown countered that South Texas should still be considered
a public arm of A&AMP;M simply because A&AMP;M is state-supported.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Steve Late of Odessa cited recent Houston Chronicle
articles about the A&AMP;M-South Texas affiliation as well as a similar
affiliation crafted in Michigan in 1995. There, educators and
legislators predict students of the hybrid Detroit College of Law
at Michigan State University eventually will help channel state
funds to the private law school because they are most likely to
favor public subsidies for the law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we as board members worry about in the future,''
Late said. ``What happens down the line? I love the concept of
public-private partnerships. But the taxpayers of Texas have spent
billions to make A&AMP;M the name that it is. This is not a good deal
for the taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Bowen said A&AMP;M officials still don't plan to
lobby legislators for a measure officially approving the South
Texas affiliation. He would rather return to the Coordinating Board
next year with a reconfigured bid, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether the two schools can proceed with the
affiliation without Coordinating Board approval. South Texas sued
the board seeking a court order declaring the agreement binding.

   NEW YORK _ Everybody into the pool!
</P>
<P>
   The fairy-tale-pretty ponds in the ravishing country called
Illyria, which has materialized at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at
Lincoln Center, aren't just there for scenic purposes. People get
wet in the English director Nicholas Hytner's spirited new
production of ``Twelfth Night.'' Some jump into the water; some
fall in, and others merely get splashed.
</P>
<P>
   Now you could get all academic and argue that such incidents
correspond to the elemental imagery in the play, the greatest of
Shakespeare's romantic comedies, what with all those references to
the transforming powers of the sea and Elysian streams. But what's
occurring is really as much burlesque-comic as cosmic, an occasion
for fools and snobs to get dunked and for performers with great
bodies to strut their stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Center has come up with a seductive, classier
alternative to the rambunctious teen-age comedies that
traditionally flood movie theaters in July and August. This
``Twelfth Night, or What You Will,'' which opened last night as
part of Lincoln Center Festival '98, is never less than an
appetizing eyeful, thanks largely to the work of the great designer
Bob Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, in capturing what one character describes as the
``midsummer madness'' of the play, the production is often funny
indeed, plump with sight gags and jokes rendered in clear and
accessible terms. It even has hot young movie-marquee stars whose
presence alone is guaranteed to generate buzz: Paul Rudd, Kyra
Sedgwick and, in the pivotal role of the cross-dressing Viola, this
year's Oscar winner for Best Actress, Helen Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as enjoyable as much of this ``Twelfth Night'' is, you keep
wanting it to come together in ways it never does, and though
you're likely to leave it smiling, you may also feel frustrated by
its pervasive imbalance. Crowley's set, a sensualist's delight of a
dreamscape that hovers between Venice and Marrakech and makes
astonishing use of eye-fooling perspective, sets up expectations
for a ``Twelfth Night'' of surpassing wit and sophistication. It
promises, alas, more than much of the cast can deliver.
</P>
<P>
   The romantic leads, with the qualified exception of Ms.
Sedgwick, rarely suggest depths of character. They execute their
comic and thematic functions attractively enough. But Ms. Hunt, in
particular, has a two-dimensional flatness that keeps the audience
at a distance. As a consequence, the play's central love story,
which hinges on the complications wrought by mistaken sexual
identity, offers a tidy quota of laughs but little in the way of
emotional nourishment.
</P>
<P>
   For that you'll need to look elsewhere, and not necessarily
where you would expect. ``Twelfth Night,'' as you may recall, tells
the story of what happens when Viola, separated from her twin,
Sebastian (Rick Stear), in a shipwreck, disguises herself as a boy
and becomes the emissary for the Count Orsino ( Rudd), with whom
she has fallen in love, in his wooing of Olivia (Ms. Sedgwick), who
herself falls in love with the man she thinks Viola is.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a subplot that revolves around the ale-soaked,
carousing Sir Toby Belch (Brian Murray), Olivia's parasitic uncle,
and his dim-witted friend, Sir Andrew Aguecheek (Max Wright), and
their run-ins with Olivia's puritanical steward, Malvolio (Philip
Bosco). The ambitious, dislikable and finally pitiable Malvolio has
always been a part to reckon with, portrayed by heavyweights like
Henry Irving and Laurence Olivier, and Bosco does a creditable,
workmanlike job with it.
</P>
<P>
   But the revelations of the production come from Murray and
Wright, who transform the low high jinks of Toby and Andrew into a
blissful vaudeville as rich in psychological detail as it is in
hilarious shtick. If it weren't for Crowley's bedazzling sets, this
Elizabethan Laurel and Hardy would walk away with the show. As it
is, they bring a warm verisimilitude to scenes that are often
treated as throwaway comic relief. In contrast, the primary story
of addled lovers and misdirected passions starts to look like
something that might be titled ``Fast Times at Illyria High.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't necessarily inappropriate to ``Twelfth Night.''
There's definitely a quality of arrested, self-involved adolescence
about Illyria's posturing aristocrats. Orsino, who thinks he wants
nothing more than to marry Olivia, is never happier than when
striking attitudes of lovelorn melancholy, while Olivia, in
mourning for her dead brother, revels in the melodrama of
bereavement.
</P>
<P>
   The play's opening images, accordingly, are soaked in an
atmosphere of self-indulgence. Orsino is first seen lolling
languorously and toking on an opium pipe with his courtiers on the
patterned carpeting that covers much of the stage and that has as
its dominant motif a peacock. When he later speaks of ``the
constant image of the creature that is beloved,'' he is not above
staring at his own reflection in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, our first glimpse of Olivia, in a self-conscious
procession of women in exaggerated mourning costumes (the clever
work of Catherine Zuber), establishes her as a pose-striker par
excellence. When she pauses reverentially by a pond, a skull pops
out of the water, in one of the work's many amusing visual
flourishes. Grief, for Olivia, is obviously something of a game.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Viola, who arrives to stunning effect as she wades to shore amid
swirls of mist, is the antidote to this artificiality: sane,
unaffected and emotionally grounded. In some ways, the all-American
Ms. Hunt nicely fills this bill. Her voice, the aural equivalent of
the Great Plains, certainly brims with a common-sensical approach
to life. But hitched to Shakespeare's language, especially the
poetry, it develops a singsong quality that belies her character's
claim that she can speak in ``many sorts of music.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a Viola of lyrical feeling, we get an emotional
efficiency expert, perfectly at ease in men's clothing. ( Stear's
Sebastian, by the way, both looks and sounds remarkably like Ms.
Hunt's Viola.) This works fine when she's skeptically summing up
the convolutions of the plot, and Ms. Hunt has some charming
business when Viola is forced into a sword fight.
</P>
<P>
   But in contrast to the subtle sensuality she generated in her
Oscar-winning role in ``As Good as It Gets,'' she seems not so much
sexually ambiguous as sexually disinterested, even when Viola (in
the guise of Orsino's page, Cesario) has to undress her employer
for a swim.
</P>
<P>
   This absence of chemistry robs the play of any erotic danger,
though not for want of directorial effort: Hytner has Viola's hands
straying to Orsino's hips when he kisses her on the brow and Ms.
Sedgwick's Olivia wrestling Viola-Cesario to the ground while
kissing her/him full on the mouth. But the scenes feel spurious
somehow; what you feel you're watching is actors carrying out a
director's instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd, the comely star of the film ``The Object of My
Affection,'' directed by Hytner, has a good time posing as an
eternally bare-chested poseur. But it's a one-note, if exuberantly
realized, performance that doesn't let Orsino grow from false love
into the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sedgwick is potentially a first-rate Olivia; she has the
requisite glamour and a confident grasp of the comedy's language
that lets her play inventively with line readings. She is
ill-served, however, by Hytner's direction, which has Olivia shed
her dignity in her first speaking scene and never reclaim it. As
she progresses through a series of increasingly revealing outfits,
in hopes of capturing Cesario's attention, she registers as the
sort of hungry man trap found in old slapstick routines.
</P>
<P>
   Murray and Wright certainly understand slapstick. Hytner has
steered them through some delicious physical comedy, in which they
are ably assisted by the more straightforward performances of Amy
Hill as Maria, Olivia's crafty lady-in-waiting, and Skip Sudduth as
their friend Fabian. But Murray and Wright also create the kind of
complete portraits that allow you to imagine the lives their
characters lead when they aren't onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Murray locates a chilling, class-conscious viciousness in Toby,
never so evident as when he drunkenly sputters at Malvolio,
``Aren't thou any more than a steward?'' And you're always aware of
the ravages of age and alcohol; this Toby is first kin to Falstaff.
Wright's Andrew Aguecheek, of the stuttering speech and fluttery
footwork, provides a beautifully assured picture of a
heartbreakingly tentative soul, a stupid man who can never be more
than an imitative echo of others.
</P>
<P>
   Without ever ceasing to be funny, these actors elicit the
subliminal sadness and anxiety in ``Twelfth Night,'' even more than
this production's Malvolio, who becomes the victim of a practical
joke pushed too far, and the clear-eyed philosophizing clown, Feste
(David Patrick Kelly), who anticipates Lear's fool.
</P>
<P>
   Bosco, a fine actor, is more than adequate, but his character
seldom transcends the role of disapproving foil and easy target for
the others, bringing to mind Gale Gordon's curmudgeonly boss in
``The Lucy Show'' on television. Kelly is an unusually low-key,
close-to-invisible Feste, a sort of Depression-era folk hobo type,
whose songs, set to music by the talented Jeanine Tesori (the
composer of the musical ``Violet''), are bizarrely reminiscent of
James Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twelfth Night'' also features an appealing on-stage band,
directed by Kimberly Grigsby. In addition to indulging the musical
requests of the moody Orsino and Olivia, whose funeral obsequies
are given haunting voice by the counter-tenor Marshall Coid, the
musicians strike astral chords to suggest the ordering,
otherworldly providence at work in ``Twelfth Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tesori's music here is fantastical and wonder-struck, a
fitting accent to the exquisite visual pipe dreams conjured by
Crowley's set and Natasha Katz's lighting. It's unfortunate that
the characters onstage don't always measure up to the ethereal
charms of the land they inhabit. But this Illyria _ a place, after
all, of much mirth and beguiling spectacle _ remains an inviting
oasis for theatergoers in search of escape from Manhattan in its
dog days, and their own midsummer madness.

<P>
   In a move that may signal the end of major mergers in the U.S.
defense industry, Lockheed Martin Corp. on Thursday abandoned its
planned $8.3 billion acquisition of Northrop Grumman Corp., a deal
that the government opposed on antitrust grounds.
</P>
<P>
   After months of negotiations between the companies and the
government to avoid a court battle, Lockheed said Thursday that
efforts to reach a pre-trial settlement were ``not successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lockheed board voted Thursday afternoon to end a takeover
that would have created the nation's largest military supplier,
nearly a third larger than its nearest competitor.
</P>
<P>
   In March, nearly eight months after the deal was first
announced, the Justice Department, supported by the Defense
Department, filed suit to block the acquisition, claiming that a
combination of the two companies threatened the nation's defense.
This action represented an about-face for the Defense Department,
which had long encouraged a wave of mergers that swept through the
military industry since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our inability to reach an acceptable solution, combined with
our concern over the litigation with our principal customer,
necessitates this decision,'' said Lockheed chairman and chief
executive Vance Coffman. ``Continuing the litigation at this point
is simply not in the best interests of Lockheed Martin's customers,
shareholders or employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed, which itself has grown through the acquisition of 22
different military contractors to become the nation's No. 2
military supplier, is best known as the maker of the F-16 fighter
plane and many missile systems. Northrop, which makes components
for the B-2 bomber, is the nation's No. 3 supplier.
</P>
<P>
   The government feared that a combination of the two would create
an unacceptable level of ``vertical integration,'' in which
Lockheed could control too much of Northrop's electronics business
in ways that could suppress competition and drive up prices.
</P>
<P>
   Northrop chairman and chief executive Kent Kresa said Thursday
that ``while we believed the merger was in the best interests of
our constituencies, Northrop Grumman can and will continue as a
strong, independent competitor.''

   UNITED NATIONS _ An anti-narcotics program begun in Afghanistan
late last year is in danger of being dismantled, a top U.N.
official said, citing reports that opium poppy production may be
increasing in areas under the control of the Islamic Taliban
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Pino Arlacchi, executive director of the U.N. Drug Control
Program, also said in an interview that he was hearing for the
first time of the opening of refineries to produce morphine, if not
heroin, near the heart of the Taliban's religious center of
Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
   Both increased production and the refining of opium would
violate the accord under which the United Nations would provide
development aid in return for a gradual reduction of poppy
cultivation.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here Thursday, Noorullah Zadran, the
Taliban's representative-designate to the United Nations, said that
the Taliban strongly opposed narcotics but that the drug-control
program had demanded too much of the Taliban too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Arlacchi, one of a shrinking group of U.N. officials who have
been optimistic that agreements made with the Taliban would
eventually work as planned, said he expects to get full reports in
coming weeks on the planting of new opium crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pillar of the agreement is that they should destroy all
the new poppy crops that we will detect or they will detect,''
Arlacchi said from his headquarters in Vienna. ``When we get the
precise sites under cultivation, we will go back to them and ask
them immediately to destroy this cultivation. If they will not do
it, we will have to reconsider our agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Arlacchi said he has told countries that contribute to aid for
Afghanistan that if the Taliban, which controls about 85 percent of
Afghanistan, do not comply, he was prepared to use the aid money to
reinforce border patrolling around the country, particularly in
Iran and Tajikistan, through which Afghan opium passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until this moment, they actually delivered on the agreement,''
Arlacchi said. ``On the first of June they destroyed two tons of
opium.'' But new information has made him ``rather pessimistic,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zadran of the Taliban said of the anti-drug program, ``God knows
we tried. There is a difference in cultures. There is a different
perception.'' He added that money intended for the Afghans was
being used tp by U.N. administrative expenses before it reached the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Zadran complained that of a $16 million pledge to the Taliban in
development aid, the Drug Control Program had spent $11 million on
administrative costs. ``They gave us $1.8 million for a project
near Jalalabad area and they spent another $3.8 million in
Helmand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The aid was to cover agricultural supplies and eventually some
light manufacturing to supply jobs in areas where the opium crop is
important to family earnings. Even though the Taliban totally
opposes the use of narcotics, it has been unable to provide
economic alternatives to offer the people.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban was also ``insulted,'' he said, by its exclusion
from a U.N. drug summit meeting in June at which the leader of the
fragmented former government driven out of Kabul two years ago was
allowed to speak because his rump administration still holds the
U.N. seat _ an anomaly that persists because the United States and
other countries will not vacate the seat until the Taliban has met
conditions to hold it.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Zadran also criticized private relief
agencies in Kabul for refusing to move their residences, though not
their offices, to a student hostel at the edge of the city.
Responding to threats by the agencies to leave the country if they
were forced to move, Zadran said he would question ``the morality
and wisdom'' of such action, which would put the lives of children
and others at risk.

&HT;        JERRY BROWN OUTLINES VISION FOR CITIES
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Elliot Zaret  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 16 -- Forget global trade. Instead of bailing
out Mexico, send the money to poor U.S. cities. And if the World
Bank can forgive loans for faltering economies, can't someone
forgive Oakland's stadium debt?
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Brown, Oakland's mayor-elect, outlined his vision for
cities Thursday in Washington. And for watchers of the man who was
nicknamed ``Governor Moonbeam'' during his two terms as
California's chief executive, the vision was as far-reaching and
off-beat as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who says he has shifted from being a ``global thinker''
to being a ``local thinker,'' wants to shift federal debate -- and
spending -- away from global trade and back to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the metro economies, at which the city is the
core, 47 of the world's 100 largest economies are in the U.S.,''
said Brown. ``The question is what kind of goods are being
exchanged and what kind of skills are being developed -- a few
blocks from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal policies that have encouraged the flight from cities to
the suburbs should be reversed, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cities have tremendous capacity if the federal government
would adjust its policies,'' said Brown. ``Not to subsidize the
cities, but to reduce the subsidies that encourage suburban
sprawl.'' Brown's ideas include building schools as small as 100
students in 6,000 square-foot buildings, cutting all capital gains
on businesses that invest in the cities, reclaiming shut-down
industrial plants, and changing welfare and housing laws to reduce
the concentration of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are crumbling schools, there are crumbling neighborhoods
and they're going to drag the nation down with it,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Not limiting his remarks to the needs of cities, Brown took time
to renew his call for campaign finance reform, defend a
controversial newspaper series blaming the CIA for crack dealing,
and to criticize the rightward movement of world politics.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, he wanted to give a hopeful view of Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Brown even took on author Gertrude Stein's famous quote about
Oakland: ``There's no there there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If something's already there, you got something in your way.
But if you have an unspent canvas, then you have a lot of
potential,'' said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a there in Oakland, he said, is what will make his
job different from the other Mayor Brown -- Willie in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``In San Francisco, all they have to worry about is whether
they're going to put a new museum in Golden Gate Park. We have real
problems in Oakland.''

 &HT;    Cather odd man out in bullpen shuffle
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The choice had become apparent to Mike Cather, maybe
even before management finalized it. As he packed his equipment for
the trip back to Richmond, the Braves' latest bullpen displacement
understood perfectly why he was leaving Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of saw the writing on the wall,'' Cather said shortly
after being informed of his demotion to Class AAA, freeing a 25-man
roster spot for Mark Wohlers. ``I don't take it personally. I think
I'm throwing the ball really well lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Cather's 36 appearances were second only to Kerry Ligtenberg's
(43) and, while his ERA climbed to 4.38 earlier in the season, he
had allowed two runs in his last 8 2/3 innings. But with three
pitchers _ Dennis Martinez, Rudy Seanez and Russ Springer _ out of
minor league options and John Rocker the lone left-hander and
Ligtenberg closing games, the Braves had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to keep everybody that we got,'' said manager Bobby
Cox. ``Rocker's been doing a good job. We want to keep him. Dennis
Martinez's stats aren't all that great maybe _ hits (74) to innings
pitched (58 1/3) _ but he'd done a good job and if we (designate
him for assignment), we lose him. If we sent Rudy out, he has to be
designated and he's gone. Cather, by numbers and technicalities,
unfortunately is the one who has to go.''
</P>
<P>
   BP with the VP
</P>
<P>
   Vice president Al Gore stopped by Turner Field for batting
practice and a little bit of everything else. He talked fishing
with Ryan Klesko, gave Walt Weiss a special vice presidential cap
for his son Brody and was presented with a team jersey by Tom
Glavine. He had a side chat with Thursday starter Greg Maddux but
asked the subject matter, Maddux replied, ``Top secret man, can't
tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   In search of . . .
</P>
<P>
   Besides checking into the current market for closers, the Braves
continue their almost annual survey for left-handed relief help.
General manager John Schuerholz maintains he could enter the
postseason with the rookie Rocker as the only left-handed reliever.
But finding a lefty set-up man is a priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say it's a top priority,'' Schuerholz said,
``but it would give us more balance with two left-handers. But it
has to be the right one, it has to be the right price, has to be
the right circumstances, has to be a lot of right things.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Richmond . . .
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence or not, left-hander Pedro Borbon, on rehab
assignment at AA Greenville, was elevated Thursday to Richmond.
Placed on the 60-day disabled list March 31 as he continued to
recover from 1996 elbow surgery, Borbon's Greenville statistics
were hardly impressive (0-2, 4.74 ERA, 21 hits and 14 walks allowed
in 19 innings) but the organization is interested in seeing his
work against more potent hitters. The 19 innings in Greenville and
three appearances in Macon are the first live innings Borbon has
thrown in 20 months.

 &HT;    Rudolph continues to outwit authorities
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS, N.C._Nine days after Eric Robert Rudolph walked out of
the Western North Carolina mountains in search of food and
batteries, law enforcement officials equipped with the latest in
gadgetry still have not been able to track the Birmingham bombing
suspect to his rugged hideout.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 local, state and federal officials from North
Carolina, Georgia and Alabama were on the ground Thursday,
searching a 30-square-mile area for the experienced survivalist.
The renewed search has rapidly expanded since Rudolph showed up at
the Nantahala residence of an acquaintance July 7 with a list of
provisions he needed and $500 in cash to pay for them with.
Although investigators found a spot where they believe Rudolph
watched the home of George Nordmann, 71, for several days, the
fugitive has vanished again, leaving no trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he's pretty good at it,'' Macon County Sheriff
Homer Holbrooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Scott, a member of the North Carolina Civil Air Patrol and
an experienced tracker, said searchers at times have spent months
looking for a single lost airplane in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one case, we lost a pretty good sized single engine Cessna
airplane for 18 months and it was 50 yards from a main highway,''
Scott said. ``They bend the trees and make a canopy. That's what
he's got right now_a canopy.''
</P>
<P>
   The dry weather also hinders the bloodhounds, investigators
said. Dampness holds in the scent.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Southeast Bomb Task Force had been
``re-energized'' after Nordmann came forward Saturday with his
report of seeing Rudolph. He told them Rudolph stole his 1977
Datsun pickup truck on July 9 and took about six months' worth of
food. Since that time, other ``solid leads'' have come in from the
community, but Woody Enderson, FBI inspector in charge of the task
force, would not characterize the tips. ``We are not going to talk
about exact locations of the search, details about witnesses and
what they have told us, or the exact operations that are going on
right now,'' Enderson said. ``Eric Rudolph is still considered
armed and dangerous. He has specialized knowledge that makes him
especially dangerous in the heavily wooded areas where we are
looking.''

CIA WORKED WITH SUSPECTED DRUG TRAFFICKERS, REPORT ADMITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.)

 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Central Intelligence Agency continued to work
with about two dozen Nicaraguan rebels and their supporters during
the 1980s despite allegations that they were trafficking in drugs,
accordijg to a classified study by the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The new study has found that the CIA's decision to keep these
paid agents, or to continue dealing with them in some less-formal
relationship, was made by top officials at the agency's
headquarters in Langley, Va., in the midst of the war waged by the
CIA-backed Contras against Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government.
</P>
<P>
   The new report by the CIA's inspector general criticizes agency
officials' actions at the time for the inconsistent and sometimes
sloppy manner in which they investigated _ or chose not to
investigate _ the allegations, which were never substantiated by
the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report, which has not yet been publicly
released, also concludes that there is no evidence that any CIA
officials were involved in drug trafficking with Contra figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental finding of the report is that there is no
information that the CIA or CIA employees ever conspired with any
Contra organizations or individuals involved with the Contras for
purposes of drug trafficking,'' one U.S. intelligence official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new report is the long-delayed second volume of the CIA's
internal investigation into possible connections between the
Contras and Central American drug traffickers. The investigation
was originally prompted by a controversial 1996 series in The San
Jose Mercury-News, which asserted that a ``dark alliance'' among
the CIA, the Contras and drug traffickers had helped finance the
Contra war with millions of dollars in profits from drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   The second volume of the report dismisses those specific
charges, as did the first volume.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury-News series alleged that this alliance created a
drug trafficking network that was the first to introduce crack
cocaine into South Central Los Angeles. The series prompted an
enormous outcry, especially among blacks, many of whom said they
saw it as confirmation of a government-backed conspiracy to keep
blacks dependent and impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury-News subsequently admitted that the series was
flawed and took its reporter, Gary Webb, off the story. He later
left the paper.
</P>
<P>
   The first volume of the CIA inspector general's report, issued
in January, dealt primarily with the allegations raised by the
Mercury-News series and dismissed the newspaper's central findings.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA released a declassified version of the first volume, in
which the agency said that the Mercury-News charges were baseless
and mentioned drug dealers who had nothing to do with the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   But John Deutch, the director of central intelligence at the
time, had also asked the inspector general to conduct a broader
inquiry to answer unresolved questions about the Contra program and
drug trafficking that had not been raised in the Mercury-News
series. Frederick Hitz, then the CIA's inspector general, decided
to issue a second, much larger report to deal with those broader
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the allegations in the second volume parallel charges
that first surfaced in a 1987 Senate investigation. The CIA is much
more reluctant to publicly release the complete text of the
approximately 500-page second volume than it was of the first,
because it deals directly with Contras the CIA did work with.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, CIA officials involved in the Contra
program were so focused on the fight against the leftist Sandinista
regime that they gave relatively low priority to collecting
information about the possible drug involvement of individuals in
the Contra army. The report concluded that CIA officers did report
on drug trafficking by the Contras, but that there were no clear
guidelines given to CIA officers in the field about how intensively
they should investigate or act upon the allegations.

 WASHINGTON: the allegations.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In all, the CIA received allegations of drug involvement against
about 50 figures in the Contra movement over the course of the war
against the Sandinistas, according to the report. Those allegations
were leveled against members of the Contra army as well as its air
transport and support networks. Some of the allegations may have
been specious, the result of Sandinista propaganda, while other
charges may have been more substantive, U.S. intelligence officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   It could not be determined from the CIA's records how many of
those 50 cases were fully investigated by the agency. But of those,
the CIA continued to work with about two dozen figures alleged to
be involved in the drug trade, according to U.S. intelligence
officials familiar with the report. They said the report found that
the agency was unable to either prove or disprove the charges, or
did not conduct adequate investigations into the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials, who provided information about the
report, declined to identify the individual Contras who were the
targets of the drug allegations. But they did say that while most
of the charges were leveled against individuals, the report found
that drug allegations had been made against one Contra
organization, a group known as ``Adren 15th of September.'' That
group was formed in 1980 and was disbanded in January 1982, in the
early stages of the Contra war.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's decision to classify this second volume has already
been met with criticism on Capitol Hill. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.,
who led a 1987 congressional inquiry into allegations of Contra
drug connections, wrote a letter Thursday to CIA Director George
Tenet asking that the report be immediately declassified.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, who has reviewed the second volume of the inspector
general's report, added that he believes CIA officials involved in
the Contra program did not make a serious effort to fully
investigate the allegations of drug involvement by the Contras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us in Congress at the time, in 1985, 1986, were
calling for a serious investigation of the charges, and CIA
officials did not join in that effort,'' Kerry said. ``There was a
significant amount of stonewalling. I'm afraid that what I read in
the report documents the degree to which there was a lack of
interest in making sure the laws were being upheld.''
</P>
<P>
   CIA officials notified Congress at the time of most of the
``significant'' cases in which the agency decided to continue doing
business with those Contras accused of dealing in drugs, the report
states, but it does not detail the exact nature of the
Congressional notification.
</P>
<P>
   One former CIA official familiar with the Contra program
disputed the notion that agency officials did not take the drug
charges seriously at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You investigate all of them, and when they were credible, and
when we could substantiate them, we would certainly take action,''
the former official said. ``But wild or unproven allegations would
not by themselves be enough to displace someone from the
organization. Otherwise, we would have had no discipline or morale
in these organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of drug involvement on the part of the Contras was
hardly the only time that a group connected to the CIA has been
accused of dealing in narcotics. The agency's local allies in
Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, and in Afghanistan after the
Soviet invasion of 1979, also were accused of drug trafficking.

PROSECUTION ATTACKS EX-AIR FORCE CADET'S VERSION OF GIRL'S SLAYING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ Before she was shot twice in the face,
16-year-old Adrianne Jones was grabbed by the throat with such
force that pinch marks were left on her neck, a pathologist
testified Thursday in the capital murder trial of former Air Force
cadet David Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned by the prosecution, Dr. Marc Krouse said left-hand
finger marks on the girl's neck were probably those of Graham, not
his former fiancee, Diane Zamora.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony by the Tarrant County pathologist seemed to
undermine the dramatic defense strategy revealed Wednesday by
Graham's attorney _ that Graham was not even present when Jones was
killed and that his jealous fiancee alone murdered the girl.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora, a former U.S. Naval Academy cadet, was convicted of
murder earlier this year and is serving a life sentence. Now Graham
is on trial.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of their arrests, Graham and Zamora both confessed
to the Dec. 4, 1995, murder of Jones, who was shot to death on a
remote country road in the Dallas suburb of Grand Prairie. The
accused couple both said Zamora wanted Jones to die because she had
sullied the pure love the couple felt for each other. Graham had
told Zamora that he and Jones, whom he knew from the high school
track team, had had a one-time sexual encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his own trial, Graham contends the sexual encounter was a
lie and that his confession to helping Zamora kill Jones is also a
lie.
</P>
<P>
   But on the second day of the trial, moved to the Hill Country
town of New Braunfels because of heavy publicity in the Dallas-Fort
Worth area, the prosecution sought to raise immediate questions in
the minds of jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Casting doubt on a statement contained in both Zamora's and
Graham's written confessions that Zamora used a barbell to hit
Jones in the head, Krouse theorized Jones was hit with the butt of
a gun. The purported murder weapon was a Russian army handgun found
in Graham's attic. Krouse said the wound on Jones' head was so
deep, it had to be caused by ``a large and very muscular person.''
</P>
<P>
   Questioned by Graham's lawyer, &UR;  &LR; Krouse conceded that the marks
on Jones' throat could have been caused by Zamora if she were
wearing thick gloves. But other witnesses had established that at
the time of the murder, Zamora was recovering from a car-wreck
injury to her left hand.
</P>
<P>
   In another blow to Graham's defense theory, Zamora's former
``best friend'' testified about numerous incriminating admissions
that Zamora made to her that also implicated Graham.
</P>
<P>
   `` `That's how David proved his love for me. He killed her,' ''
Christina Mason quoted Zamora as saying a few days after the
murder. But the defense team scored a few times, too, as it
questioned the veracity of Graham's confession and attacked the
quality of the police investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's attorney, Dan Cogdell, got Mason to admit that before
honing her testimony for Zamora's and Graham's trials, she had lied
to her family, police, prosecutors and a grand jury when she denied
knowledge of the crime. Mason testified she didn't believe Zamora's
admissions and feared getting involved, even when police, early in
the investigation, jailed an innocent teen-age boy for the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Police witnesses conceded they may have tainted key evidence by
improperly handling the two 9mm shell casings found near Jones'
body. Police also acknowledged they didn't exercise full control of
the crime scene in rural Tarrant County.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Graham faces only life imprisonment because
prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The crime went unsolved for nine months before Zamora and Graham
were arrested in September 1996, based on Zamora's guilt-ridden
admissions to classmates at the U.S. Naval Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Once on trial, however, Zamora testified that it was her
boyfriend who killed Jones and that she only confessed to help
protect him. On the witness stand, she portrayed Graham as a
violent youth who demanded sex often, threatened her and almost
single-handedly killed Adrianne Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Although Graham, a former cadet at the U.S. Air Force Academy,
confessed to shooting Jones to prove his love for Zamora, his
lawyer now says he wasn't present when Jones was killed. The
alleged motive was that Zamora wanted Jones killed for a one-time
sexual encounter she had with Graham _ an event that Graham now
says he made up.
</P>
<P>
   . The head blow could have been fatal if left untreated, but
death was the result of two gunshots to the face _ one to the cheek
and one to the forehead, Krouse said. &QL;

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a 1990s variant of a John Henry-style
competition between man and machine, researchers using a homemade
supercomputer have cracked the government's standard
data-scrambling code in record time _ and have done it by
out-calculating a team that had harnessed thousands of computers,
including some of the world's most powerful.
</P>
<P>
   That breakthrough, in a contest sponsored by a Silicon Valley
computer-security software company, is being hailed by critics of
U.S. export policy for data-scrambling technology as proof that a
well-heeled group of terrorists or other criminals could easily
break the code used by many banks, financial institutions and even
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The government has long sought to keep the most powerful
scrambling, or encryption, software out of the hands of foreign
criminals or terrorists by setting limits on the strength of such
software that can be licensed for export. Critics of that policy
have argued that not only is more powerful encryption technology
already available from foreign producers, but the
government-approved version is too weak to truly protect legitimate
business users.
</P>
<P>
   The code was cracked using a mere $250,000 worth of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The type of encryption that was broken, known as DES, for Data
Encryption Standard, has traditionally been used by banks and other
financial institutions for protecting the transmission of funds and
other transactions requiring high security. It has also been used
in certain instances by the U.S. military. The form of DES that was
broken uses a 56-bit key, far more secure than the 40-bit keys that
the government allows to be exported.
</P>
<P>
   Because of concerns about security, however, many business users
are increasingly employing a more robust form, called Triple DES,
in which the length of the digital key that unlocks the scrambled
data is only three times as large but exponentially more secure.
Triple DES has never been broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more evidence that the government's crypto policy has
been overtaken by technology,'' said Marc Rotenberg, director of
the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy-rights group
in Washington. ``It's about time to end the limits on strong
encryption techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   The winners of the $10,000 prize _ given by the contest's
sponsor, RSA Data Security Inc. _ were John Gilmore, a computer
privacy and civil liberties activist, and Paul Kocher, a 25-year
old cryptographer who has gained notoriety in recent years for
clever attacks on security systems, including those designed to
protect smart cards and Internet software.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore and Kocher were able to unscramble the key to unlock and
read a single block of scrambled data in 56 hours. Their home-made
machine beat a network of almost 20,000 computers, ranging from
desktop PCs to multimillion-dollar supercomputers working
cooperatively in a scheme known as distributed processing.
</P>
<P>
   Under almost all encryption schemes, each message is scrambled
in a different way. Thus, breaking the key to the contest message
did not give them access to other messages scrambled with DES.
</P>
<P>
   The government has long asserted that it would not be possible
for a terrorist or other criminal group to design and make a
computer capable of cracking DES.
</P>
<P>
   To prove that building a supercomputer would be within the means
of many sinister groups, Gilmore assembled his computer for
$250,000 from thousands of customized chips capable of testing more
than 90 billion different keys each second.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real news here is how long the government has been denying
that these machines were possible,'' said Bruce Schneier, a
cryptography consultant and president of Counterpane Systems in
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was financed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a
San Francisco-based civil liberties and privacy organization that
has sparred with government and industry over the impact of new
technologies on traditional civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore, who was a co-founder of the foundation and who for
years has been active in promoting privacy and civil liberties
issues on the Internet, was the first employee of Sun Microsystems
Inc., a computer company founded in 1984. In recent years he has
been an outspoken advocate for traditional privacy rights in
cyberspace, which he believes are threatened by the potential for
government abuse of powerful new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The computer was designed by Gilmore and Kocher, who ultimately
assembled a team of about a dozen computer researchers to build the
machine from more than 1,000 chips, each designed to test millions
of the mathematical keys that can unlock a scrambled message.
</P>
<P>
   The chips and the circuit boards on which they were mounted _ 27
boards each holding 64 chips _ were installed in several old Sun
computer chassis. The boards were linked by a simple cable to a
standard personal computer that controlled the entire process.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the growing power of personal computers and the
ability to hook inexpensive computers together has made cracking
DES far less daunting to organizations with limited resources.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, RSA Data Security Inc., a Silicon Valley software
company, offered a prize to the first person or organization that
successfully cracked a DES scrambled message. The prize was claimed
within five months by a loosely connected group of computers
scattered around the Internet. In early 1998, the prize was offered
again, and it was claimed in 39 days.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore named his custom chip Deep Crack, a tongue-in-cheek
allusion to IBM's chess-playing Deep Blue. Each Deep Crack chip is
a collection of 21 special units capable of performing a DES
encryption on a character millions of times a second. After each
unit completes a scrambling operation it checks its result against
a table to determine if it has found an ``interesting result'' _
that is, a letter or a number that could possibly be part of a
complete message.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday evening, after checking billions of keys, the
computer was able to determine that the message that had been
hidden by the RSA judges was: ``It's time for those 128-, 192-, and
256-bit keys.''
</P>
<P>
   To unscramble the message, it had to try 17,902,806,669,197,312
keys, or about 25 percent of all the possible combinations.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For years, Saddam Hussein has been waging an
energetic propaganda campaign, claiming that the Iraqi people are
the victims of sanctions imposed on Iraq by the international
community. Let's get it straight: Saddam Hussein is responsible for
the suffering of his people.
</P>
<P>
   These sanctions are targeted directly at the Iraqi regime,
because of its continued refusal to live up to the conditions it
accepted at the end of the Gulf War, including those demanding the
elimination of its weapons of mass destruction capacity. These
sanctions are not directed at the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that Saddam, eager to keep as much money or supplies
as he can grab, has deprived his people and then used their
suffering as a means to increase support for lifting sanctions. It
is a policy that is both cynical and cruel, and must not be allowed
to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the sanctions, which will remain in place
until the Iraqi regime complies with all relevant U.N. resolutions,
have never precluded the shipment of humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, the international community is committed to
ensuring that Iraqis have access to the primary humanitarian goods
they need.
</P>
<P>
   These sanctions have a very specific purpose: to remove Saddam's
capacity to threaten his neighbors and the world with an arsenal of
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   He has shown that he is willing to use such weapons against his
neighbors and his own people. This jeopardizes the security and
stability of the region and challenges vital U.S. national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the economic sanctions and the concurrent
U.N. weapons inspections have been very effective in reducing
Iraq's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, despite the regime's
attempts to obstruct and reluctance to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Had Saddam chosen to fulfill his obligations and fully disclose
his weapons programs, significant progress toward the lifting of
sanctions could have been achieved long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Because of our commitment not to jeopardize the dignity and
well-being of the Iraqi people, the United Nations, led by the
United States, proposed the oil for food program in 1991,
immediately after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   For almost six years, Saddam said ``no'' to such a program
because he wanted to control the revenues that oil sales would
generate _ a condition that the United Nations refused to accept.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Saddam finally agreed to cooperate with the program and
sell oil, the profits from which are placed in a U.N.-controlled
escrow account to be used to pay for food, medicine and other basic
necessities.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, more than $3 billion worth of supplies have
successfully been delivered to the Iraqi people. This effort has
substantially improved the diet of the average Iraqi.
</P>
<P>
   To even further address Iraq's needs, the United States has
strongly supported renewed efforts within the United Nations to
expand the humanitarian relief effort this year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the provisions of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1153,
the largest relief operation in U.N. history will be made available
to the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   This program will offer more humanitarian assistance to the
Iraqi people over the course of one year than was provided by the
United Nations for global humanitarian assistance in the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam claims that the humanitarian goods paid for from the sale
of up to $10.4 billion worth of oil every year under resolution
1153 will not suffice, and he continues to demand that the
sanctions be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   But his real motive, as demonstrated by his record of misrule,
is clearly not to help his people but to get his hands on hard cash
in order to support his own personal and political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Resolution 1153 not only provides humanitarian goods, it also
allows for the reconstruction of Iraq's civilian infrastructure,
including water and sanitation facilities. Under great
international pressure, Saddam has submitted a plan, acceptable to
the United Nations, for the distribution of funds among these
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The international community hopes that he will indeed move to
ease, not impede, the flow of assistance to his people. But, in the
event that the regime reverts to its obstructive behavior, we are
consulting with other governments and the community of
nongovernmental organizations on how best to deliver goods and
services to the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to supplying goods to meet the Iraqi people's day to
day needs, we are working with other countries to supply
educational equipment, so that Iraq will not lose a generation to
ignorance and will be able, post-Saddam, to reclaim its historical,
cultural, intellectual and political role within the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   We have made it eminently clear since the implementation of the
sanctions that we have the highest regard for the Iraqi people and
support the territorial unity and the integrity of their country.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi people deserve better than the rule of Saddam. Until
they are relieved of that burden, we are determined to see that
everything is done to ensure that they can enjoy as decent a life
as is possible under an indecent regime. We will not cease to work
toward that objective. &QL;

   TOKYO _ An outright showdown is looming as Foreign Minister
Keizo Obuchi, backed by the ruling party's largest faction, is set
to formally announce his candidacy for the Liberal Democratic
Party's presidency as early as July 16, while Health and Welfare
Minister Junichiro Koizumi also said he may also vie for the post.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi on July 15 gained virtual approval for his candidacy at a
meeting of LDP politicians belonging to the party faction he heads.
Former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama, known within the
party as a power broker, at the meeting did not oppose Obuchi's
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   He is also expected to publicize his specific idea of what sort
of government his leadership would aim to create at the official
announcement of his candidacy, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Koizumi, meanwhile, said Wednesday he is aware that intraparty
support for him as an opponent to Obuchi is ``more vocal than
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to watch the situation carefully to decide if I
have any chance of winning (the party presidential race),'' Koizumi
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitsuzuka faction, headed by former Finance Minister Hiroshi
Mitsuzuka and to which Koizumi belongs to, also held a meeting on
July 15 and started considering whether the group should back
Koizumi as a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The stepping up of the rivalry over the selection of the party
president, who will succeed resigning Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, marks a sharp shift in the party's approach to
intraparty elections, the party sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi had hoped to secure behind-the-scenes support for his
leadership before making his intentions known publicly. But the
public's growing distaste for traditional factional jockeying made
it clear that a more conventional contest for the party presidency
is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Although a more open leadership election _ which may be held at
the July 21 meeting of LDP members from both Diet chambers _ means
Obuchi will have to compete openly with other contenders, public
perception of the process made the election necessary, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other LDP politicians who may also join the race to head the
party include ex-party president Yohei Kono and even former Prime
Ministers Kiichi Miyazawa and Yasuhiro Nakasone, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Allies of Obuchi _ who has an overwhelming support base not only
from his own faction but from other factions like the one headed by
Miyazawa _ said the foreign minister's leadership is needed for
Japan to maintain its current positive ties with such key nations
as Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But some party members, and even some members of the foreign
media, argue that Obuchi's skills for carrying out sound economic
policies are untested. They hint that the financial markets would
not react positively to Obuchi being in the prime minister's chair.
</P>
<P>
   Younger LDP members, who are calling for Koizumi's presidency,
claim the self-styled reformist is the only person who can rival
Naoto Kan, leader of Minshuto (Democratic Party of Japan) and the
voters' favorite, according to many opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is that with Obuchi at the head of the LDP, the
ruling party would be dealt another severe blow in the next Lower
House election.
</P>
<P>
   Koizumi also said on July 14 if Obuchi does not renounce LDP
policies put in place by Hashimoto, he might win the party
presidency but lose the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has not official announced he will seek the LDP top
spot, Koizumi hinted he may run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am watching the developments (of the intraparty debate),''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koizumi, often referred to as the ``lone wolf,'' is known as a
staunch advocate of the privatization of the nation's postal
services.
</P>
<P>
   He became known nationwide when he ran for the party
presidential race three years ago, when Hashimoto was almost
certain to win without an election.
</P>
<P>
   Kajiyama's advantage is the leading role he has played so far in
presenting proposals to tackle the nation's economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Kajiyama advocated shifting from Hashimoto's belt-tightening
polices earlier than many other politicians. His suggestions for
disposing of the banking bad loans are believed to have been
positively received by the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   But Kajiyama's greatest disadvantage is that only a limited
number of leading politicians, such as Nakasone, support him. Some
LDP members warn that Kajiyama's leadership would eventually lead
to an alliance with the Liberal Party, led by Ichiro Ozawa.
</P>
<P>
   Many LDP members still view Ozawa with disdain after he left the
LDP to create an anti-LDP government.
</P>
<P>
   Calls for Miyazawa to take over as prime minister again are
meant to prevent intraparty squabbles from becoming too serious,
LDP sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Kono may bring a positive reaction from voters, but he lacks the
support base in the party, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Nakasone, meanwhile, said he will refrain from entering the race
at this time. &QL;

<P>
   TOKYO _ An outright showdown is looming as Foreign Minister
Keizo Obuchi, backed by the ruling party's largest faction, is set
to formally announce his candidacy for the Liberal Democratic
Party's presidency as early as July 16, while Health and Welfare
Minister Junichiro Koizumi also said he may also vie for the post.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi on July 15 gained virtual approval for his candidacy at a
meeting of LDP politicians belonging to the party faction he heads.
Former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama, known within the
party as a power broker, at the meeting did not oppose Obuchi's
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   He is also expected to publicize his specific idea of what sort
of government his leadership would aim to create at the official
announcement of his candidacy, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Koizumi, meanwhile, said Wednesday he is aware that intraparty
support for him as an opponent to Obuchi is ``more vocal than
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to watch the situation carefully to decide if I
have any chance of winning (the party presidential race),'' Koizumi
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitsuzuka faction, headed by former Finance Minister Hiroshi
Mitsuzuka and to which Koizumi belongs to, also held a meeting on
July 15 and started considering whether the group should back
Koizumi as a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The stepping up of the rivalry over the selection of the party
president, who will succeed resigning Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, marks a sharp shift in the party's approach to
intraparty elections, the party sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi had hoped to secure behind-the-scenes support for his
leadership before making his intentions known publicly. But the
public's growing distaste for traditional factional jockeying made
it clear that a more conventional contest for the party presidency
is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Although a more open leadership election _ which may be held at
the July 21 meeting of LDP members from both Diet chambers _ means
Obuchi will have to compete openly with other contenders, public
perception of the process made the election necessary, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other LDP politicians who may also join the race to head the
party include ex-party president Yohei Kono and even former Prime
Ministers Kiichi Miyazawa and Yasuhiro Nakasone, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Allies of Obuchi _ who has an overwhelming support base not only
from his own faction but from other factions like the one headed by
Miyazawa _ said the foreign minister's leadership is needed for
Japan to maintain its current positive ties with such key nations
as Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But some party members, and even some members of the foreign
media, argue that Obuchi's skills for carrying out sound economic
policies are untested. They hint that the financial markets would
not react positively to Obuchi being in the prime minister's chair.
</P>
<P>
   Younger LDP members, who are calling for Koizumi's presidency,
claim the self-styled reformist is the only person who can rival
Naoto Kan, leader of Minshuto (Democratic Party of Japan) and the
voters' favorite, according to many opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is that with Obuchi at the head of the LDP, the
ruling party would be dealt another severe blow in the next Lower
House election.
</P>
<P>
   Koizumi also said on July 14 if Obuchi does not renounce LDP
policies put in place by Hashimoto, he might win the party
presidency but lose the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has not official announced he will seek the LDP top
spot, Koizumi hinted he may run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am watching the developments (of the intraparty debate),''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koizumi, often referred to as the ``lone wolf,'' is known as a
staunch advocate of the privatization of the nation's postal
services.
</P>
<P>
   He became known nationwide when he ran for the party
presidential race three years ago, when Hashimoto was almost
certain to win without an election.
</P>
<P>
   Kajiyama's advantage is the leading role he has played so far in
presenting proposals to tackle the nation's economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Kajiyama advocated shifting from Hashimoto's belt-tightening
polices earlier than many other politicians. His suggestions for
disposing of the banking bad loans are believed to have been
positively received by the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   But Kajiyama's greatest disadvantage is that only a limited
number of leading politicians, such as Nakasone, support him. Some
LDP members warn that Kajiyama's leadership would eventually lead
to an alliance with the Liberal Party, led by Ichiro Ozawa.
</P>
<P>
   Many LDP members still view Ozawa with disdain after he left the
LDP to create an anti-LDP government.
</P>
<P>
   Calls for Miyazawa to take over as prime minister again are
meant to prevent intraparty squabbles from becoming too serious,
LDP sources said.

   Kono may bring a positive reaction from voters, but he lacks the

 By JAYNE CUSTRED  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
SOUTHPORT, England _ The first round of the 1998 Open Championship
was anything but British.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wind stopped blowing Thursday, the sun shined brightly, and
the American duo of Tiger Woods and John Huston made the most of
the tame conditions at Royal Birkdale.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, playing some of his best golf since last year's Masters
victory, and Huston each finished at 5-under-par 65 on a course
that barely resembled the monster that players had to tangle with
earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price, Fred Couples and Loren Roberts were tied for third
at 4-under 66, while five golfers were grouped at 67, including
Brad Faxon and Davis Love III.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have predicted about 10-over for a winning score if
every day was like Monday,'' Huston said. ``It was almost
impossible. But it gradually got a little easier each day.''
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, it was nearly perfect for golfers and fans. And
while it was the British Open, it was the young man from the States
who drew the biggest gallery, and Woods didn't let them down.
Playing conservative, smart golf, Woods eased his way around the
course, using his driver only four times and consistently keeping
the ball in play.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' performance showed exactly how far he has come in the
past year. At the 1997 British Open at Troon, Woods went wild with
the driver. He slashed it around the course _ he was 12 over par on
four holes _ and finished tied for 24th.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, however, he made few mistakes, missing two short
putts for his two bogeys but otherwise playing patiently and
methodically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those things where I think I learned to just
play smart golf,'' Woods said. ``It is an evolution process that I
think every player goes through. If you ask any player back in
their teens and early 20s, they hit the ball pretty hard. But as
they get older, they learn to control their game. I'm no exception
to that. I'm still learning to flight the ball and learning a lot
of different shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``But overall, I'm very pleased with my progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The first-round results were pleasing as well. Woods' only real
trouble was on the second hole, where he drove into the deep rough
and had a terrible lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there's no way it could come out the way it did,''
Woods said. ``I mean it flew to the middle of the green.
Realistically, I was facing bogey right in the eye. But the ball
came out good and I made a great putt down there to about a foot
and tapped that in. I felt really good about my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods went on to make birdies on four of the next seven holes.
Woods did miss a little three-footer for par on No. 12. And his par
putt on No. 18 lipped out, giving him a closing bogey to finish
tied with Huston. But that did little to dampen his enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased,'' he said. ``I made a lot of good putts and
drove the ball very well. Consequently, I was able to control my
spin on the greens because I was in a lot of fairways.''
</P>
<P>
   It was much the same story for Huston, who has played
consistently all year, winning the Hawaiian Open in February.
Huston got off to a slightly rocky start, having to make a
25-footer to save par on the first hole, but he cruised around the
course otherwise. He made all pars on the front side and then
played the back nine at 5-under.
</P>
<P>
   Huston's best effort came on No. 17, where he drained a
40-footer from across the green for an eagle 3, and on No. 18,
where he came back with a birdie after driving into the rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played really solid,'' Huston said. ``I've played pretty
solid most of the year, actually, and kept my focus and (have) been
pretty determined.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it helps that Huston is finally feeling up to par. He
battled tendinitis in his elbow and bursitis in his shoulder for
most of last year and struggled on the golf course. Then, a fan
approached him in the parking lot after a golf tournament and told
him about magnet therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured it couldn't hurt,'' Huston said. ``So I've been
sleeping on a magnetic mattress cover that I even travel with, and
it seems to really help. The magnets are supposed to increase your
blood flow so it heals the body faster. I don't think there's any
proof that it actually does work other than people who use them
think they feel better.
</P>
<P>
   ``With me, it took a couple of days before I started feeling
almost no pain.''
</P>
<P>
   That was evident in Huston's performance Thursday. His 65 was
his best round ever in a British Open. In fact, it tied for his
second-lowest round of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Couples' 66 tied his lowest British Open effort. After making an
eagle on the 15th hole to get to 4-under, Couples appeared headed
toward a three-way tie for the lead with the easy par-5 17th coming
up. But his drive ended up in the deep right rough, and Couples had
to scramble to save par. Still, he was pleased with his effort and
the way his game is shaping up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm very close to playing like I did a long time
ago, when every time I went out I thought I was going to play well
or win,'' said Couples, whose best British Open finish was third in
1991 here at Birkdale.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has shot lower than 65 in a British Open. He had a
third-round 64 last year that kept him in the tournament. But he
looked much more comfortable Thursday, a fact he attributed to
arriving in Europe a week early and spending some time playing
other links courses.
</P>
<P>
   That, and being one year older and wiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be very creative in order to play over here,''
Woods said. ``You have to see these shots and lies and get a feel
in your hands. I think by playing over here more and more, as the
years go by, I'm getting better at it. Now tomorrow, I can play
smart golf, take it easy and just see if I can make some putts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't have to force the issue to get back into the
tournament, because I'm right there right now.''

APPEALS COURT REJECTS EFFORT TO KEEP SECRET SERVICE OFFICIALS FROM
TESTIFYING
</HEADLINE>
   (With CLINTON-STARR-TEXT) 
(sw) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Acting with unusual speed, nine judges on the
federal appeals court here unanimously rejected a last-minute
request by the Clinton administration to block the testimony of
Secret Service officials, including the head of President Clinton's
protective detail, in the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department immediately responded with an emergency
petition forwarded to Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the
Supreme Court. The sealed petition asks Rehnquist, who is in Europe
while the court is in recess, to delay any testimony by Secret
Service officials until the full court can consider the
administration's appeal, lawyers involved in the case said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decision by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia was not surprising because the full court does
not often grant reviews. Moreover, every judge who has considered
the administration's legal argument for a novel privilege shielding
Secret Service agents from testifying about the president has sided
with the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   And a terse order issued earlier on Thursday by three of the
nine appeals judges once again signaled that the administration
faced long odds. ``We also believe, for the reasons stated in our
opinion of July 7, 1998, that the Justice Department's likelihood
of success before the Supreme Court is insufficient to warrant
further delay in the grand jury's investigation,'' said the three
judges, who first heard the appeal last month.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, had sought the testimony
of a few uniformed Secret Service officers for several months.
After court decisions were issued in his favor, including the
appellate ruling last week by the three-judge panel involved in
Thursday's action, Starr cast a wider net this week. He subpoenaed
the agents closest to President Clinton, setting off a firestorm of
criticism by administration officials and laying the groundwork for
a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was punctuated by a flurry of legal briefs and
rapid-fire court rulings that started early on as seven Secret
Service officials under subpoena prepared to enter the grand jury
room on Thursday morning. Their testimony was temporarily put off
at the last minute so that appeals could be pursued.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, administration officials began bracing
for the possibility that some of the agents may have to appear as
early as next week when the grand jury resumes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the agents subpoenaed this week was Larry Cockell, the
head of Clinton's detail who spends more time with the president
than any other Government employee. Anticipating that Cockell, an
18-year-veteran of the Secret Service, may soon have to spend
considerable time being questioned, the agency on Thursday
temporarily reassigned him to a less demanding job. Officials said
it would be impossible for him to be at the president's side in
Washington and on the road if he must also spend time as a grand
jury witness.
</P>
<P>
   While the decision on Thursday moves the Secret Service
officials one step closer to testifying before the grand jury, it
also foreshadows future court disputes between the independent
counsel and the president.
</P>
<P>
   The president's private lawyers have expressed concern that
investigators may ask Secret Service agents what they may have
overheard of conversations between Clinton and his lawyers. Such
questions would be all but certain to prompt a new round of legal
wrangling over the parameters of the lawyer-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The blanket rejection of the administration's appeal came
remarkably quick, just two days after Attorney General Janet Reno
pleaded for the judges to intervene and avert what she said ``is
likely to result in a national tragedy.'' The Secret Service has
been maintained that if agents are forced to testify, they will no
longer be able to protect the president adequately because he could
be inclined to push them away.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had also prepared for an eventual missive
to the Supreme Court, by lodging its emergency petition early on
Wednesday night with the clerk of the court. And it moved on
Thursday have the papers put in Rehnquist's hands. The appellate
court gave the Secret Service until Friday at noon to seek a stay
from Rehnquist. But the order by the three appeals court judges
reduced the chances that the chief justice would intervene.
</P>
<P>
   They found that the Justice Department had failed to show a stay
was necessary to avert an ``irreparable harm.'' Supreme Court
practice requires Rehnquist to make such a finding before issuing
any stays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Justice has not made a sufficient showing
that irreparable harm will result unless a stay and an order are
issued, and it has not made a sufficient showing that it will
ultimately prevail in establishing the privilege it alleges,''
wrote the three judges, Douglas Ginsburg, A. Raymond Randolph, and
Stephen Williams. ``The privilege is said to be necessary because,
without it, the President will distance himself from Secret Service
agents charged with the duty of protecting him.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The harm asserted is future harm, depending on a prediction
about what the President will do in the absence of the privilege.
This court has ruled that the privilege does not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If harm of the sort the Department envisions is now occurring,
it therefore must be because the President does not believe the
Supreme Court will sustain the privilege,'' the order said.
``Neither a stay nor an order under the All Writs Act can alter or
prevent that alleged harm. Testimony today by Secret Service agents
regarding past events cannot change our ruling. And such testimony
cannot affect how the Supreme Court will rule.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's assertion of a special privilege for the
agents has been rejected by every judge who has considered it. Even
several of the president's advisers predicted that in light of
Thursday's decisions, it would be unlikely that Rehnquist would
issue a stay. The Supreme Court does not begin hearing cases until
it returns in October.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   White House officials, who have said that Clinton has not been
involved in the Secret Service appeal, declined to comment on
Thursday's ruling. But they took issue with a concurring opinion to
the full court's ruling rejecting the administration's request for
review.
</P>
<P>
   In the concurring opinion, Judge Laurence Silberman wrote that
the attorney general was ``acting as the President's counsel under
the false guise of representing the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am mindful of the terrible political pressures and strains
of conscience that bear upon senior political appointees of the
Justice Department when an Independent Counsel (or special
prosecutor) is investigating the President of the United States,''
Silberman wrote. ``Those strains are surely exacerbated when the
President's agents literally and figuratively `declare war' on the
Independent Counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge's comments were disputed by Charles Ruff, the counsel
to the President.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we have stated before, the attorney general and the
secretary of the Treasury have made their decisions on how to
proceed in this matter with complete independence, guided by the
advice of career law enforcement professionals,'' Ruff said. ``They
have had only one interest _ to ensure that the Secret Service is
able to perform its vitally important duties. Any suggestion to the
contrary is without foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Secret Service officials received a reprieve from
having to appear the grand jury, the jurors continued their work on
Thursday by hearing from Linda Tripp for the sixth time. It was
Mrs. Tripp who began the Lewinsky inquiry when she called the
independent counsel's office last January and said she had secretly
recorded conversations with, Ms. Lewinsky, her former Pentagon
colleague, that suggested an unlawful coverup.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp is scheduled to return to the grand jury when it
resumes its deliberations next Tuesday.

POLICE MAY HAVE HAD RIGHT TO SHOOT DURING RAID, DA SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RAD SALLEE and JO ANN ZUNIGA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Harris County District Attorney John B. Holmes Jr.
said Thursday that the six Houston police officers involved in a
Sunday raid in which a man was killed could have been within their
rights to shoot him _ even if they had no right to be in his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any authority at this point that gave them the
right to be in that residence,`` Holmes said, ``but that doesn't
make the shooting a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The six suspended officers, assigned to the gang task force at
the Southwest patrol division, reportedly fired about 30 shots
after breaking into Pedro Oregon Navarro's apartment at 6711 Atwell
at 1:30 a.m. Sunday in southwest Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Oregon, 23, who died from multiple bullet wounds,
have retained attorney Paul Nugent to investigate his death.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent said family members told him that even after Oregon was
shot, the officers tried to bully them into saying he had been
dealing drugs. He said they had denied it.
</P>
<P>
   Police acknowledged that no drugs were found in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro was a father, soccer player and landscape worker,''
Nugent said. ``What we have here is a good kid from a good
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said that because the law does not allow anyone to resist
an arrest, even an illegal one, officers had a right to use deadly
force against Oregon if he threatened them. A pistol was found at
the scene, but police have not yet said whether it had been fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do not have to sit still for a citizen pointing a firearm
at them, even if they entered unlawfully,'' Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were _ every one of them _ in uniform,'' he said. ``There
should not be any reasonable idea in your mind that you are being
the victim of a kick burglary.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators removed pieces of carpet to be tested to determine
whether bullets had struck the floor where Oregon's body lay.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they continued to fire when there was no need, it would be
murder,'' Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said Texas law at one time had recognized a person's
right to resist an unlawful arrest. But since the mid-1970s, the
law had required that everyone submit to arrest, even in their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The only exception, Holmes said, is the right to defend yourself
against unreasonable force, such as being beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said his investigation is continuing, along with those of
the police homicide and internal affairs divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said the pistol had been traced to its initial purchaser,
whom he would not identify, except to say it was not Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Further investigation has to be done,'' Holmes said. He said
there is no reason to think it was placed at the scene by police to
justify the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, who had no search or arrest warrant, have told
investigators they raided the place after a confidential informant
told them he had witnessed a drug transaction there.
</P>
<P>
   A source told the Houston Chronicle that the tipster was not
registered with Houston police, as is required of all police
informants. Holmes said the tipster had just been arrested and was
trying to make a deal with officers.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said that violates the policy of his office, and any such
deal would not be honored by prosecutors and would not stand up in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a reliable informant had seen drugs sold in the house,
Holmes said, officers would have to get a warrant from a judge
before breaking in.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are some circumstances that justify warrantless
entry _ hot pursuit, for instance _ Holmes said he knows of none
that applies in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's mother, Claudia Navarro, and his sister, Susana,
identified his body Thursday at the Harris County Medical
Examiner's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a disaster,'' Claudia Navarro said at the southwest
apartment where the raid took place. Oregon's blood stained the
gray blanket in his bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent, sweeping his hand across the small living room, said,
``Does this look like the apartment of a drug dealer?''
</P>
<P>
   Six bullet holes are readily visible in Oregon's bedroom wall.
The bullets apparently entered the next-door apartment's bedroom,
which happened to be vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Consul General Manuel Perez Cardenas said he has
discussed the shooting with Police Chief C.O. Bradford because the
family is from Mexico. Perez said he is satisfied that the
investigation will be thorough.
</P>
<P>
   Perez said his government probably will send a ``diplomatic
note'' to U.S. officials in Washington, noting the Mexican
government's interest in the case.

BUSH SAYS DEAL REACHED ON TOBACCO CASE LAWYERS' FEES 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Gov. George W. Bush announced Thursday that an
agreement had been reached on how the fight over $2.3 billion in
lawyers' fees will be handled in the state's tobacco lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement between Bush, Attorney General Dan Morales and
private lawyers appears to have cleared the last major stumbling
block to the final payment of the state's $15.3 billion settlement
with the tobacco industry for unreimbursed health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and seven legislators had sued to block the payment of 15
percent contingency fees to the private lawyers who had handled the
state's suit against the tobacco industry. Morales had agreed to
the fees and was defending the payment.
</P>
<P>
   But under the deal agreed to by all sides Thursday, the issue of
attorneys' fees will be severed from the rest of the lawsuit, Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said the private lawyers will take their claim for
fees to an arbitration panel in November. That panel will determine
how much money the lawyers should receive in payments from the
tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``An objective arbitration panel will now decide what is fair
compensation for the plaintiff's attorneys, and that amount will be
paid by the tobacco companies,'' Bush said. ``I have agreed I will
not contest the amount the arbitration panel orders the tobacco to
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he reserved the right in the agreement to continue his
fight against the high lawyer fees if the lawyers go back to court
in an effort to get more money than is awarded them by the
arbitration panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement is a good step toward protecting the interests
of Texas taxpayers,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement apparently will allow the private lawyers to
collect a $50 million down payment on their fee from the tobacco
industry before the matter goes to arbitration. The lawyers already
have been reimbursed $40 million for expenses they said they
incurred during the lawsuit.

WASHINGTON PLAYED LEADING ROLE IN SAGA OF RUSSIA'S ECONOMIC
BAILOUT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven weeks ago the chief of the International Monetary Fund,
Michel Camdessus, assured the world's financial markets that there
was no reason to panic about Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to what markets and commentators are imagining,''
Camdessus insisted as investors were fleeing the Russian markets ,
``this is not a crisis. This is not a major development.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, in a complete reversal, the IMF and the Russian
government announced a bailout package that will inject $17.1
billion in new loans to the beleaguered nation over the next 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was the driving force behind the
reversal, impelled by the specter of Russia's financial collapse.
United States Treasury officials were worried that while
negotiations with the Russians dragged on over forcing real
economic change, the political peril to the government of President
Boris Yeltsin was growing. They pressed the fund to nearly double
the amount of money it was willing to lend to Russia, even though
it depleted the IMF's own resources for fighting the economic
contagion that is spreading beyond Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian saga once again casts a spotlight on the critical
decisions made by the IMF at a moment when the Asian financial
crisis has made the institution more powerful than at any time in
its 52-year history. IMF critics charge that in this case, fund
officials underestimated the gravity of the crisis and dragged out
the negotiations while the markets turned against Russia and the
eventual cost of the bailout rose. IMF officials counter that it
would have been a waste of money to offer yet another bailout to
Russia without extracting a commitment to fundamental economic
changes that are painful and politically unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   By last week, the negotiations turned into a race to rescue the
Russian economy before the government's financial reserves were
exhausted. Without new funds, Russian officials feared they would
run out of money to prevent a default on Russia's debt and prop up
its currency by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week was the most dangerous period,'' Yegor Gaidar, the
former prime minister who is now an economic adviser to Yeltsin
said in an interview. ``If we followed all the standard procedures,
the money would have arrived too late. I think the position of the
leading industrial nations was very constructive and the U.S.
Treasury helped a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The final package is not a permanent solution; it buys time for
what U.S. officials believe is the most reform-minded government in
Russia in years. In Washington, however, there is palpable
nervousness about the deal that was struck. It is unclear whether
Yeltsin and his new prime minister will be able to fulfill their
commitments to remake their economy.
</P>
<P>
   The accord has sparked a rally in Russian markets. On Thursday,
after a series of ups and downs, the lower house of Parliament
approved key parts of the package as the Kremlin rushed to fulfill
the IMF requirements before the fund convenes on Monday to consider
the rescue package. ``We view this very much as a last chance for
Russia,'' said Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official at the IMF, who
directed the negotiations for the fund. ``The country is running
out of time.''

MICROSOFT REPORTS 25 PERCENT EARNINGS HIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WARREN WILSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Strong software sales across the board, plus a kick
from Windows 98, pushed Microsoft Corp.'s quarterly earnings to
$1.36 billion or 50 cents a share, slightly above Wall Street
estimates and 25 percent above a year ago, the company reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues in the April-June quarter, the last in Microsoft's
fiscal year, reached $4 billion, up 26 percent from a year ago. For
the full year, revenue was up 28 percent to $14.48 billion while
net income totaled $4.49 billion or $1.67 a share.
</P>
<P>
   (Excluding a $296 million write-off from Microsoft's purchase of
WebTV Networks, earnings per share were $1.78, up 35 percent from
fiscal 1997.)
</P>
<P>
   Coming despite a relative lack of major new releases, the strong
results reflected continued high demand for the company's
bread-and-butter products _ its Windows and Windows NT operating
systems and its office productivity package, Office 97.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the year, the one that probably exceeded expectations by
the largest amount was Office,'' chief financial officer Greg
Maffei said in an interview. ``But for the quarter, all three did
quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   The results did include $150 million in revenue from Windows 98,
the desktop operating system upgrade that was released to computer
makers in May and launched in retail stores on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft announced Thursday that retail sales of Windows 98 had
already reached the 1 million mark, though most of those sales
would have come after the June 30 end of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're off to a super, flying start on Windows 98,'' Maffei
said in a conference call with analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly results also included a $34 million increase in
administrative expenses, much of it due to the cost of fighting
antitrust lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some high-priced talent trying to help us, and that's
expensive,'' Maffei said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales and earnings in fiscal 1999 are expected to benefit from
two major new products, SQL Server 7.0 and Office 2000. A final
test version of the new SQL Server is being distributed now to more
than 50,000 sites.
</P>
<P>
   But Windows NT 5.0, a much-anticipated new version of
Microsoft's high-end operating system for businesses, is no longer
expected to be released in time to make a big contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Maffei made his customary cautionary statements about future
earnings, warning that Asia's economic woes, poor foreign-exchange
rates and some aging products all could take a toll.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts are predicting lower revenue growth in the year
ahead than in the one just ended, he noted, adding, ``We would
agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Per-share earnings in the July-September quarter might be down
only a little _ ``perhaps a penny'' _ from the quarter just ended,
he said.

UNDATED: of time.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   In May, the week before the annual summit meeting of Western
leaders, the two U.S. officials who have focused on Russia's
economic reform went to Moscow to take the temperature.
</P>
<P>
   One was Lawrence Summers, the deputy Treasury secretary, a
former Harvard economist who has come to personify the new face of
U.S. financial power around the world. The other was David Lipton,
a Treasury under secretary for international affairs, an intense,
44-year old who has cultivated a strong relationship with Russian
economic strategists.
</P>
<P>
   The economic crisis that began a year ago in Asia has been a
worry for Russia for months. As investors fled emerging markets, it
was becoming more difficult for Russia to finance its chronic
budget deficits by selling treasury securities. European and U.S.
bankers were offering loans but they were pricey, and Russian
officials had been exploring the possibility of additional credit
for the Central Bank's reserve of foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Russian government, fresh from a bruising battle in
the Communist-dominated Parliament to confirm the new prime
minister, was still trying to find its footing.
</P>
<P>
   In talking with their Moscow counterparts, Summers and Lipton
cautioned the Russians that they were too absorbed in their own
political and economic problems and insufficiently focused on the
risk that they would catch the Asian flu, a panicked retreat by
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, however, were not alone in underestimating the
potential fallout from the Asian crisis. The IMF was also slow to
respond, and when it did, critics say, it fueled investor anxiety
by refusing to disburse the next part of a loan to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The monetary fund, which was created after World War II to
stabilize currencies and foster economic growth, has been a leading
proponent of better management of Russia's shaky economy; lower
inflation, smaller deficits and better tax compliance. And while
the fund has been impressed with Kiriyenko and his new team, the
relationship between the fund and the government is not always
good.
</P>
<P>
   IMF officials complain that the Russians have failed to keep a
series of promises they have made since 1992. For their part,
Russian officials say the fund is constantly changing its Russian
team and that some officials have a shallow understanding of the
nation's complicated politics.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, however, the tension is kept under wraps. But
it burst into view in late May when the two sides tried to settle
what Russia needed to do to receive the next $670 million
disbursement of a three-year, $10 billion loan.
</P>
<P>
   The talks went badly and Russia did not get the money. Martin
Gilman, the chief IMF official in Moscow, warned publicly that
Moscow had not done enough to get the money and pointedly said he
could not predict when the matter would be discussed again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a statement was very bad news for the market,'' Sergei
Alekshashenko, the deputy chairman of the Central Bank, said in an
interview. ``I have negotiated with the fund for five years and I
cannot think of a single case in which the fund has made such a
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Russians were shocked, alarm bells rang when the bond and
stock markets began a new week. Interest rates on loans to Russia
shot up, a sign that investors considered them a risky buy, and the
Russian stock market sank. Last year, Russia was the world's best
performing emerging market, but it is down 50 percent since the
start of the year and tied with Indonesia for the world's worst
performance.
</P>
<P>
   With the markets deteriorating, Kiriyenko made a late-night
phone call to Camdessus, the fund's managing director, and assured
him that the Russians were serious about changing their ways. The
IMF then rushed out a statement praising the Yeltsin government's
reform program and Camdessus issued his ``this is not a crisis''
line. To try to stop the panic, John Odling-Smee, the head of the
monetary fund's Russia department, flew to Moscow to complete the
negotiations for the $670 million disbursement the fund had been
blocking.
</P>
<P>
   But investors were pressing for a new, larger loan package to
strengthen the Russian Central Bank and to restore their confidence
in the economy. The problem was that the bank's hard currency
reserves were shrinking as it was using millions of dollars each
business day to pay off investors and prop up its currency.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the IMF's public remarks, though, it looked like it
had little interest in organizing a rescue and did not understand
the extent of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   So Yeltsin went directly to the power behind the fund: the
Clinton administration. He dispatched to Washington the Russian
with the most credibility in the West, Anatoly Chubais.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais had run Russia's privatization program and was highly
regarded, although he is one of the most contentious figures in the
country. Many Russians blame him for the pain and confusion of
their country's jerky transition to capitalism, and powerful
business leaders have never liked the fact that he had refused to
do their bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais had left his top Kremlin post as part of the shake-up
that brought Kiriyenko to power in the spring. He now runs Russia's
electrical monopoly, United Energy Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais was joined by Sergei Vasiliev, deputy chief of staff for
the Russian government and aveteran of the behind-the-scenes battle
for economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving just before the long Memorial Day weekend, the Chubais
team headed straight for the Treasury building next to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   They came not for money but for reassuring words of praise and
for a public commitment from Clinton that if Russia needed more
aid, the United States would lend its support.

UNDATED: its support.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next morning, Chubais and his associates drove through the
diplomatic enclave of northwest Washington to the home of Strobe
Talbott, deputy secretary of state and longtime Russia expert.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott told them that Clinton was willing to support additional
financial help to Russia under the right conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians drove on to Summers' house in the Maryland suburbs.
Lipton and other top Treasury officials were there, all wearing
blue jeans and sport shirts. The Russians were in suits and ties,
preparing to meet later with the ever-formal Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Over bagels, muffins and orange juice, Chubais made his appeal:
Washington had an historic opportunity to help Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that there were only a few reformers,'' Chubais
said. ``Then there were a good number of reformers. In this
government,'' he said, ``They are all reformers.''
</P>
<P>
   As the conversation shifted to tactics, the group decided that
the United States would send a signal that it stood behind Russia.
But it would have be carefully worded so that Congress would not be
inflamed at the idea of another bailout. In return for aid, there
had to be substantial reforms. The Russians would also have to tap
commercial banks so that it was clear that not all of the burden
fell on the monetary fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to be clear that we would help out, that if they didn't
take real action this time, they were headed over the cliff,'' a
senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, a Sunday, Clinton issued a brief statement
saying the United States would support assistance with
``conditionality.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton never mentioned any figures but Russian officials say
the two sides agreed on $5 billion to $10 billion. The Americans
favored the smaller number; the Russians the higher number.
Quietly, the IMF and the Russians opened negotiations over the
rescue package. Their focus was not on how much money was needed,
but on what Russia had to do to qualify for the loans.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, the fund's No. 2 executive and a former economics
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said his
principle was simple: The amount of aid would be linked to the
depth of the reforms. More reform, more cash. The fund was not in
the business of throwing money into a country to calm financial
markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fund doctrine that the stronger the measures the country
takes the more assistance the fund can provide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western economists however, insisted that the IMF was too
doctrinaire. They insisted it would make more sense for the fund to
first determine what was needed to ease market turmoil and then
tell the Russians what they would have to do to earn it.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was meeting the requirements an easy task.
</P>
<P>
   In a confidential memorandum, the fund handed Russian officials
a tough list of demands A main one was that the Russian budget
deficit had to be drastically reduced from 5.5 percent of the
nation's output to between 2 percent and 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The plan made fiscal sense. Interest payments on Russia's debt
were eating up 30 percent of the Russian budget. But the Russians
were worried that they could not meet such an ambitious target and
that they would be faulted for again promising something they could
not deliver. Yeltsin had submitted his own ``anti-crisis'' plan to
the Parliament. But the IMF's analysis indicated the plan only went
half way to meeting the goals.
</P>
<P>
   To meet that target the government would not only have to slash
spending, it would have to beef up tax collection , an enormous
challenge in a country where major companies thumb their nose at
the State Tax Service and only 4 percent of the population filed
tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   While the demands were considerable, it was far from clear that
the money the fund had in mind would be enough. The IMF informed
the Russians in early July that it was prepared to offer $5.6
billion in additional loans.
</P>
<P>
   As the negotiations dragged on, the Russia economic picture
worsened. A second attempt to sell off Russia's state oil company,
Rosneft, stalled. To attract investors, interest rates on Russian
debt had risen higher than the rates paid by Nigeria, which was
convulsed in its own political turmoil. Russian coal miners, angry
that they had not been received their wages, set up a squatters
camped outside Kiriyenko's government offices and demanded
Yeltsin's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Returning from Clinton's nine-day trip to China, U.S. officials
focused anew on Russia and were alarmed by what they saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a sense that Kiriyenko was running out of steam and
that the Russian government was getting politically more vulnerable
a senior State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of crisis was driven home when the Russians offered
record interest rates at an auction for Russian treasury bills on
July 8 but were unable to attract enough buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Chubais and other top Yeltsin aides were becoming
increasingly desperate. The finance ministry's ruble reserves to
pay off maturing treasury securities were shrinking fast. The
Russian government's internal forecast also showed that the Central
Bank reserve of hard currency, the funds it uses to prop up the
ruble, would soon fall to $12 billion from twice that level a year
ago. (By comparison, China has reserves of about $150 billion.)
</P>
<P>
   Worse, every day the markets were open, both reserves were
dwindling and it looked like the government would be out of money
before the negotiations with the IMF would be wrapped up at the end
of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais urgently appealed to Washington and, at Treasury's
urging, the IMF doubled its offer to Russia to $11.2 billion. The
World Bank kicked in several billion more. Japan made good on a
$1.5 billion loan promised to Yeltsin last April.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States, which had offered $3 billion each in
direct, ``backup financing'' to Indonesia and South Korea last
year, offered nothing to Russia. Officials feared that if they did,
Congress would rebel, further threatening long-standing efforts in
the House of Representatives to increase funding to the IMF, itself
increasingly stretched.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the United States and its allies agreed to lend the
fund $23 billion through an IMF loan program not used in 20 years.
The IMF insists that its tough approach worked. Yeltsin committed
himself to a far-reaching effort to get Russia's runaway budget
under control. ``What we had to do was accomplish real reform, to
get the Russians out of this cycle of a crisis every six months,
Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are doubts about the IMF's approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IMF was slow to recognize how serious the problem had
become, Marc Holtzman, the president of corporate finance for ABN
Amro, a large Dutch bank said this week. ``When they were finally
pushed, the fund did the right thing. But had the fund done the
same thing four to six weeks earlier, it could have averted a lot
of pain. The fund would have gotten away with a package half the
size.''

MICROSOFT LOGS GAIN OF 28 PERCENT IN EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Showing practically no financial pain from its antitrust
battles, Microsoft Corp. reported a 28 percent gain Thursday in its
fiscal fourth quarter earnings, modestly exceeding Wall Street
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also said it had already sold more than 1 million
copies of its new operating system software, Windows 98, to
consumers. The company began to sell the new software only last
month.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is the leading maker of personal computer
software, reported its financial results after the markets' close.
In Nasdaq trading, Microsoft shares closed at $117.375, unchanged.
In after-hours trading, shares fell to $116.875.
</P>
<P>
   Although the release of Windows NT 5.0, Microsoft's more
powerful operating system, has been delayed, probably until the
fiscal year 2000, analysts said the fundamental business was so
strong that it might continue to provide earnings in excess of
estimates next year.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials showed little concern about a substantial
increase in general administrative costs, which include legal
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one impact is that our legal costs are up quite a large
amount,'' Greg Maffei, the company's chief financial officer, said
in a telephone interview. He said the antitrust suits, filed by the
Justice Department and 20 state attorneys general in May, had not
affected revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is gratifying that it appears consumers are looking to the
quality of the products and are buying them,'' Maffei said. ``The
reality is it was a great quarter. Windows 98 is off to a flying
start, and we had good revenue from Windows 98 in the quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter that ended on June 30, Microsoft earned $1.36
billion, or 50 cents a diluted share, compared with $1.06 billion,
or 40 cents a diluted share, in the comparable period a year ago.
Revenue rose 26 percent, to almost $4 billion from $3.18 billion in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp., which tracks earnings
estimates, had expected Microsoft to earn 48 cents a share,
although the so-called whisper number, offered to customers
verbally, was 50 cents, exactly as reported. Revenue was about $200
million above most estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revenues up 26 percent was higher than expected, and they also
added $425 million to deferred revenues, bringing that to $2.9
billion, so that is a pretty terrific showing,'' said Rick
Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the next three quarters we're looking at slower growth
because the product cycle is a bit slower,'' Sherlund said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In recent years Microsoft has termed a certain amount of sales
``unearned revenues,'' to reflect a more realistic accounting of
software sales cycles. Using this system, the company said it
recognized $150 million in revenue from Windows 98 in the fourth
quarter, but deferred 35 percent of that, so only about $100
million appears in its results.
</P>
<P>
   Although some analysts add the deferred revenue back to arrive
at a presumed total, Maffei cautioned against this practice. ``Some
creative analysts continue to misuse spreadsheet products by adding
back unearned revenues,'' he said. This is done partly to justify
the increase in Microsoft's price to earnings ratio, from 35 in
1996 to 48 in 1997, to 66 now. ``Consider the obvious,'' he said.
``The stock is more expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   As they have in the past, Microsoft officials cautioned that the
company's growth rate was slowing and would continue to slow.
Although this quarter's earnings and revenue growth rates are
strong, they pale in comparison with earnings growth of 82 percent
and revenue growth of 41 percent last year. ``The growth rate for
this quarter is higher than most analysts are predicting for next
year, and I agree,'' Maffei said.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Microsoft earned $4.49 billion, or $1.67 a diluted
share, up 30 percent from $3.45 billion, or $1.32 a diluted share,
in fiscal 1997. Fiscal 1998 earnings reflect a $296 million
write-off associated with the acquisition of Web TV. Revenue rose
28 percent, to $14.48 billion from the $11.36 billion reported for
fiscal 1997.

NEW CHANNEL NEARS KICKOFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Spread out across Jantonio Turner's desk Thursday
morning were a half-dozen logo samples that he ordered up from a
nearby graphics arts house.
</P>
<P>
   The Football Network, a 24-hour-a-day cable channel that Turner
(no relation to Ted) has spent piecing together 24 hours a day for
the last two years, already needs a new symbol. Turner, who drew
the original on his Macintosh, is taking another impromptu survey.
</P>
<P>
   Some read ``TFN'' in bold letters. Some are a little softer with
the name spelled out over a stylish football swoosh in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll probably be a combination of some of these,'' Turner
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, however, decisions aren't made slowly. The
kickoff for his cable channel, in one form or another, will be
Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   That's about a year after Turner had originally planned, and not
soon enough for most football fans. And, he says, ``this time it
will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He's easy to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, a 30-year-old TV producer who could be mistaken for
actor LeVar Burton, looks more like a wide-eyed 18-year-old who
just landed in Los Angeles looking for a proverbial shot at the big
time.
</P>
<P>
   He's honestly exuberant when he talks about all the things this
new channel can provide to viewers. He's got a pen and paper handy
to scribble down any suggestion for a show. And he's realistic when
he spells out how some things can't happen overnight, resigned to
the fact he could be on only a few hours a week to start with
buying time on another network just as some other cable channels
(such as BET and QVC) got started.
</P>
<P>
   Going with a slogan that ``Enough is NEVER enough!'' Turner's
plan for creating what some are already calling heaven on earth
seems to be, at this point, a touchdown waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Turner has avoided many of the potholes that trip upstart
networks and could well in fact be viewed in the years to come as
the visionary who took the simple idea _ if there's a Golf Channel,
why can't there be a football channel? _ and made it happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, the strength is in the power of the idea,'' said
Turner, who moved this week into a new office building just east of
the Beverly Center. ``And as long as it seems to take things to
happen, in TV, when they do happen, they happen very quickly. I
could see us maybe making a splash from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   With what he calls his ``seed money,'' Turner has planted the
idea into sponsors that this can work, and his next step is to do
the same with cable operators. Unlike the pratfall that ESPN West
took this week because it couldn't get channel space on local cable
systems, Turner has already established a relationship with a
nationwide distribution cable co-op known as NCTC, which represents
more than 5,300 cable systems with 8.5 million subscribers. Small
dish companies such as DirecTV and EchoStar should have no problem
providing room.
</P>
<P>
   Turner tried raising private funds for the venture. But since
making his channel a public corporation four months ago, his goal
of a $10 million startup budget doesn't appear as out of reach as
it once did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting this together has almost been like making a movie,''
said Turner, who has been in L.A. the last seven years working in
cable TV production and small-budget films. ``You learn to stretch
every dollar from people who invest in your project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been living a dollar above the poverty line for a while
now, but I feel I've educated myself to a point that we can do what
we say we're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   From a programming structure, the grand plan is to break it down
into five major areas:
</P>
<P>
   _Because NFL and major colleges are locked into rights fees from
the most established networks, game coverage would likely be
limited to anything below NCAA Division I, but not excluding
semipro, high school and youth leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Turner wouldn't mind sponsoring the first-ever national high
school championship, and a ``Little Bowl,'' which would be the Pop
Warner equivalent to the Little League World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Tape-delayed games and classic NFL and college games are also
being sought through the teams and schools (such as UCLA and USC).
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean a school such as Cal State Northridge, currently
locked into a Big Sky contract with Fox Sports Northwest, could see
some air time?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the kind of games we want,'' said Turner.
</P>
<P>
   _News shows, not unlike what ESPN has produced as ancillary
programming to its NFL and college game shows, for all levels.
</P>
<P>
   _Events such as Notre Dame's weekly press conference, NFL owners
meetings and awards banquets.
</P>
<P>
   _Unique shows, such as former player profiles, instructional
video and lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   _Movies. How many times can you watch ``Brian's Song''?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much to go around,'' Turner said. ``And we're not
even in competition with the networks for these things. We want to
be known as a complement.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's to keep this niche channel from being scratched before
it can deliver?
</P>
<P>
   If enthusiasm was all it took to get started, Turner, a former
backup quarterback on his high school team, would have been calling
signals the Saturday a few years ago when he turned on his TV set
to watch NFL highlights and was stuck with some three-minute clips
that left him completely unsatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   If molding a dream is all it takes to keep one motivated, the
economics major from the University of Virginia says he's
well-versed in ``the distribution of scarce resources for the
maximum benefit of all.'' Meaning Turner shouldn't have a problem
turning this into something very tangible.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A U.S. district judge in Seattle ruled on Wednesday in favor of
employees of Microsoft Corp. who had been denied health and
retirement benefits and discount stock purchases because they were
classified as employees of ``temporary'' agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Carolyn Dimmick rejected Microsoft's argument in the
class-action lawsuit that any benefits should be apportioned
differently to workers who signed temporary personnel contracts in
1990, 1991 or 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs said thousands of Microsoft employees
had been denied benefits, but neither side would say how many could
now be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen K. Festor, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said he did not
expect a ruling on damages for ``at least several months.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Cullinan, a spokesman for Microsoft, said the plaintiffs
were trying to expand a ``very narrow group'' of workers referred
to in earlier court decisions upholding the plaintiffs' rights to
benefits.

HEAT DEATH TOLL RISES IN NORTH TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN ROUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   North Texas continued to suffer Thursday under an unrelenting
heat wave, with two more deaths confirmed in Dallas County and two
in Denton County.
</P>
<P>
   Brief afternoon rainstorms across northern Tarrant County cooled
off parts of the Fort Worth-Arlington area, but only for a short
time. The high temperature at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport reached 104
degrees, the 11th straight day of 100-plus-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths at home of 80-year-old Fay Motley of Dallas and
90-year-old Annie Mae Worley of Lancaster bring to 18 the number of
heat-related casualties in Dallas County since June 1. Statewide,
the total may be as high as 29.
</P>
<P>
   Two confirmations came Thursday in Denton County, north of Fort
Worth. Autopsy results showed that Jack Edward Roper, a 76-year-old
Roanoke man found dead Tuesday in his travel trailer, and
34-year-old construction worker Jose Francisco Deleon, who
collapsed on the job July 3, were victims of the heat.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no confirmed heat-related deaths in Tarrant
County. In Fort Worth, 81-year-old Grenelle Jackson was found dead
outside his home Wednesday night. Police and neighbors believe that
Jackson may have died of heat exposure, but the Tarrant County
Medical Examiner's Office has not issued a ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad part is (heat exhaustion) is 100 percent preventable''
if people drink fluids and find a cool place to stay, said Dr. Alan
Stockard, head of primary care sports medicine at the University of
North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth. ``Some of these
elderly can't get into a cool area.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the Fort Worth-Dallas Metroplex, city officials, social
workers and volunteers continue to reach out to people who need
help.
</P>
<P>
   Callers seeking relief have flooded Dallas County's hot line,
which was established Tuesday after the first-ever heat emergency
was declared in that county. About 700 calls have been received
since the hot line was activated, said Zach Thompson, a city
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they need a box fan, we'll get a box fan to them,''
Thompson said. ``If they're elderly and have a chronic disease,
we'll see if we can get an air-conditioning unit for them.''
</P>
<P>
   With some deaths still under investigation, and no relief from
scorching temperatures in sight, the statewide toll is expected to
climb. The National Weather Service is calling for a high of 102
Friday and 100-degree temperatures through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, Vernell Roberts, a neighbor of Jackson, said that
the elderly man probably fell Wednesday afternoon from a
step-ladder behind his home and died after crawling 20 feet in
temperatures as high as 103.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the appearance of being heat-related, age-related, or
both,'' police Sgt. J.E. Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said a friend found Jackson lying face-down at a side
door to his home about 9:30 p.m. Wednesday. Police said the man's
body was halfway inside his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he just gave out of breath and died,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   A ladder lay in the back of Jackson's house beside one of his
slippers, and his hat and eyeglasses were atop an old fan that was
propping open a rear door. It was unclear whether the fan was
operational.
</P>
<P>
   No ruling has been made in the deaths of Opal L. Enlow, 80, and
William E. Enlow, 85, whose bodies were found Sunday morning in
their home in Sanger, north of Fort Worth. The inside temperature
was more than 90 degrees when the couple was found, said an officer
with the Sanger Department of Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth have
treated nine people for heat-related illnesses this week,
spokeswoman Drenda Witt said.
</P>
<P>
   Two men described as older than 50 were admitted to the hospital
Thursday afternoon. One, whose identity is not known, was found on
his porch and is in critical condition in the intensive care unit,
Witt said. The other man, who was working in his back yard when he
became ill, is in fair condition.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest signs of heat exhaustion often include muscle
cramping and dizziness, said Stockard of the UNT Health Science
Center. Those symptoms can be followed by disorientation or
confusion, a headache and fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   In the most severe cases, a person can stop sweating and lose
consciousness, Stockard said. If the body's core temperature
reaches 105 degrees, the cardiovascular system shuts down, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alecia Hathaway, health authority and medical director for
Tarrant County, said heat injuries fall within three categories:
heat stress, heatstroke or heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Heat stress is mild and most common, especially among people
involved in physical activity, Hathaway said. It occurs when the
body is depleted of fluids.

TRANSPORATION BREAKDOWN DELAYS TIGERS' TRIP TO SANCTUARY
</HEADLINE>
 ATTN: Ohio 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mechanical problems forced a delay of more than 12 hours, but
four Bengal tigers left Edinburg, Texas late Thursday afternoon on
all-night ride to their new home at a North Texas feline sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   The flatbed trailer intended to haul the tigers wasn't working
properly, Texas Exotic Feline Foundation officials said, making
them spend most of the day adjusting equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hot, I'm tired, I'm dirty,'' said Don Feare, chairman of
the foundation's board. ``This has been a 36-hour battle just to
get on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The tigers, seized by U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials in
Brownsville, Texas, last month, were abandoned aboard the ship Gulf
Champion in May. For more than a month, they have been kept on a
ranch near Edinburg in far South Texas in the same circus trailer
that brought them to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   TEFF officials had planned to begin the 580-mile trip to Wise
County northwest of Fort Worth before dawn but were thwarted by
glitches. The truck, donated by KCI Trucking, arrived late. The
truck's trailer also had problems, and the cage carrying the tigers
had to be modified, Feare said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to get a cutting torch and cut off the skirting to fit
the trailer on the back of the truck,'' Feare said. ``We also had
to use the cutting torch to cut down the door so the tigers would
get some air. Then the circus trailer with tigers was
double-hinged, which made it difficult to load onto the back of the
flat-bed.''
</P>
<P>
   The plight of the tigers, which have been sweltering in the
South Texas heat, has attracted national attention. Residents of
Cincinnati, home of the National Football League's Bengals, have
been following every development, foundation spokeswoman Kristen
Kauffman said. Small donations have moved the foundation nearer the
$100,000 goal needed to build enclosures and care for the animals.

FCC SAID TO BE NEAR DECISION TO AID CONSUMER INTERNET ACCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moving to accelerate the delivery of high-speed Internet access
to American consumers, the staff of the Federal Communications
Commission is close to recommending that the big local telephone
companies be allowed to build data systems without having to resell
their use to competitors, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation could come as soon as Friday, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   If adopted, the plan would represent the FCC's biggest move in
favor of the Bell local telephone companies since the
telecommunications laws were overhauled in 1996. For the first time
since the act was enacted, the Bells would be allowed to expand
their networks without having to resell their systems to other
telecommunications carriers.
</P>
<P>
   William Kennard, the FCC chairman, supports the plan, which is
sure to draw waves of protest from the nation's big long-distance
carriers and from new local phone companies. The full commission
could issue a proposal next month, but the battle over the plan is
likely to spill into next year before final rules are adopted.
</P>
<P>
   The act says that incumbent local phone carriers, including the
Bell companies and GTE Corp., must resell parts of their networks
to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Bells have said that the resale provision could keep them
from investing to upgrade their networks for high-speed data
services because they would have to resell the new technology at
wholesale prices.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the Bells would be allowed to set up data
services subsidiaries that could then build the high-speed systems.
The subsidiaries would not have to resell their operations to
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   By supporting the plan, Kennard is taking his first big step
away from his predecessor, Reed Hundt, who was seen as an
implacable foe of the Bells. Kennard has come under crushing
pressure from Capitol Hill as the telecommunications act has failed
to produce the wide-ranging benefits that some experts said would
result from its passage.
</P>
<P>
   By supporting looser regulations on local incumbents, Kennard is
making his major move to deliver high-speed Internet access to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to turn what is today a trickle into a gushing
pipeline of entertainment and information into the home,'' Kennard
said in an interview Thursday. Referring to the copper telephone
wires that reach into almost every home in the nation, Kennard
added: ``The incumbents, they have the copper infrastructure. It
would be a shame not to create incentives for them to use it for
broadband services.''
</P>
<P>
   The consumer market for high-speed data services could be the
great telecommunications battlefield over the next few years. Last
month, AT&AMP;T Corp. announced a $31.8 billion agreement to acquire
Tele-Communications Inc., the No. 2 cable television company, in
preparation for that fight.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, high-speed access to the Internet has become a
widespread reality only for people who log on at the office. Most
Americans who link to cyberspace from home do so at relatively slow
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first major initiative of chairman Kennard's
chairmanship that could have a lasting impact on the nation at
large,'' said Scott Cleland, a communications policy analyst in
Washington for Legg Mason Precursor Group. ``The current policy
isn't getting it done in terms of the American consumer getting
more bandwidth.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the subsidiaries would have to deal with the
parent company on the same terms as would completely independent
competitors. In addition, the parent companies would still have to
resell basic parts of the phone network, such as the actual wires
that go into homes.

   Kennard said that such a structure would allow independent
carriers to compete fairly in offering high-speed services.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do it through a separate subsidiary they should not
use their market power to depress competition from new
competitors,'' he said, referring to the incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the long-distance companies continued to
criticize the concept of the Bells not having to resell parts of
their networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to set up a monopoly system that locks in customers
to one particular technology and locks in monopoly profits,''
Jonathan Sallet, chief policy counsel for MCI Communications Corp.,
said of the Bells.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Bells will probably maintain that they should be
allowed to build the data systems within their parent companies
without having to resell them, instead of using a subsidiary. But
if the subsidiary proposal survives, it will still be a big victory
for the Bells.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be able to provide high-speed data services to our
customers and we want to be able to do it in a way that's fair to
the company,'' said Selim Bingol, an SBC spokesman. ``We want to be
able to do it without the regulatory disincentives that currently
exist.''

$6 BILLION SURPLUS POSSIBLE FOR TEXAS BUDGET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CARLOS SANCHEZ 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ If the Texas economy remains vibrant for another year,
lawmakers could have an unprecedented $6.3 billion in extra money
to spend or to return to taxpayers, state Comptroller John Sharp
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly the largest budget surplus that the State of
Texas has ever seen in its history,'' Sharp said in a letter to
House Appropriations Chairman Rob Junell, which was made public on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the projection, Gov. George W. Bush pledged that,
once education is fully funded in the next two-year budget cycle,
he would begin to look for ways to cut state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have proposed a tax cut for small businesses and a tax break
for research and development,'' Bush said. ``With this news, we can
do more for the taxpayers of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Garry Mauro, the Democrat who is challenging Bush in the
November election, said the revenue forecast proves that Texas
could implement his programs while cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us a historic opportunity to meet the challenges we
face because we have the revenue to do it,'' Mauro said. ``Just as
I said when I announced for governor, we can eliminate the sales
tax on cars, trucks and vans and still have money to pay for more
police on the streets, a pay raise for teachers and build enough
classrooms so we can enforce class-size rules.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Chris Harris, R-Arlington, said in a recent
newsletter to constituents that any surplus should be applied to
additional school property tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, there is no justification for increases in the
sales tax or other state taxes or in professional fees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders, careful not to appear too jubilant over a
projection so large _ it is enough to fund Tarrant County (Fort
Worth) government at current spending levels for 36 years _ offered
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the Legislature an opportunity to meet the demands of
the next budget, consider a tax cut and, hopefully, put something
in a rainy day fund to guard against lean times,'' Lt. Gov. Bob
Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my opinion that when times are good, we should lay the
groundwork to prepare for lean times,'' House Speaker Pete Laney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp's projection comes one week after Legislative Budget Board
staff members forecast a $2.75 billion surplus over the current
1998-99 spending cycle of $87.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A surplus occurs any time revenues exceed the money needed to
run government.
</P>
<P>
   Policy-makers take the comptroller's estimate more seriously
than the legislative staff's because the comptroller is
constitutionally mandated to make the state's official revenue
forecast, which is the basis for the Legislature's two-year
spending plan.
</P>
<P>
   That official projection isn't expected until January.
</P>
<P>
   If Sharp's preliminary projections are accurate, the budget
windfall would outgrow the $2.4 billion budget surplus the state
started with in the 1996-97 budget period with, said Kelly Fero, an
aide to Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   The next biggest surplus was $2.2 billion in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sure are a long way from the economic debacle of 1991, when
we were about $4 billion to $6 billion in the hole'' at the
beginning of the session, Sharp said.
</P>
<P>
   His chief revenue estimator, Mike Reissig, said the current
economy continues to outperform expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Sharp's office projected that personal income in
Texas would rise by 6.1 percent this fiscal year and by 6.4 percent
in the 1999 fiscal year, which begins in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current forecast calls for these growth rates to be 7.5
percent and 7 percent during fiscal 1998 and 1999,'' Reissig wrote
in a memo to Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in income leads to increased spending, he wrote, which
has resulted in state sales tax revenue _ Texas' largest source of
revenue _ growing at annual rate of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Reissig stressed that the estimate is very preliminary.
``Issues such as the ongoing Asian crisis and the year 2000
computer bug could have negative effects on this outlook,'' Reissig
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, also cautioned that the current drought will
devastate Texas agriculture and affect the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide drought this year has already cost farmers and
ranchers an estimated $1.5 billion in revenue losses, the Texas
Agricultural Extension Service said this week.

YOUNG WINS AWAY FROM MOUND NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ He's stood on the Dodger Stadium pitcher's
mound, and he's stood in the Hollywood Park winner's circle. To
Matt Young the difference is no wider than a Louisville Slugger, or
maybe a horse's nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a thrill. It really is a thrill,'' the former
major-league left-hander said of his success as a thoroughbred
owner. ``When you see your horse on the lead, coming for home, it's
the closest adrenaline rush I've had to winning a baseball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Young pitched 10 years for five teams, including a sore-armed
1987 season with the Dodgers. He was an All-Star as a Seattle
Mariners rookie, earned a World Series ring with the Oakland A's
and threw a no-hitter with the Boston Red Sox (although he lost 2-1
to the Cleveland Indians). In the victory he calls his biggest, he
pitched a two-hitter to beat Nolan Ryan, who was coming off a 1990
no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   But Young might never have won a game as a pitcher that was as
important as the race he can win as an owner on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of five owners of Shot of Gold, a Bob Baffert-trained
colt who will bring a 5-4 won-lost record (how do you calculate a
horse's earned-run average?) into the $500,000 Swaps Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   The 1[-miler is one of the year's last major races exclusively
for 3-year-olds. And it's the highlight of closing weekend at
Hollywood Park, which will offer a $1.5 million guaranteed pick-six
on Saturday, five stakes on Sunday and Monday racing.
</P>
<P>
   Shot of Gold's victories have come in allowance and minor stakes
races in California and Kentucky. So the Grade II Swaps represents
a step up in class from Triple-A to the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't a particularly strong Swaps field, with only
Grand Slam and Old Trieste coming out of the Triple Crown events.
So Shot of Gold, ridden by Gary Stevens, definitely has a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would imagine that if you put the Breeders' Cup as the World
Series and the Kentucky Derby as a (league) championship series,
then this is like fighting for a (division) championship,'' Young,
who also pitched for UCLA, said this week from his home in La
Canada Flintridge. ``Certainly we've never run for anything this
size before.''
</P>
<P>
   Shot of Gold, by Jolie's Halo, is the seventh horse Young has
owned since his retirement from baseball in 1993. Young got
interested as a kid growing up near Santa Anita with a race-going
father. One of his partners, George Jacobs, is a high school friend
who owns Georgie's Pizza in La Canada Flintridge.
</P>
<P>
   Young picked Shot of Gold out of a Barretts 2-year-olds sale
catalog with the help of Steve Purner, son of bloodstock agent Fred
Purner Jr., who in turn is the son of a former Santa Anita
publicist. The colt cost $80,000, and has earned more than $200,000
with five wins, two seconds and a third, including a June 13
victory over Baffert's Souvenir Copy at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time out, this horse has shown us a little bit more
heart,'' Young said of the colt who didn't win for the first time
until March after racing only once at age 2 because of an injury.
``Boy, when he gets in the lane, he fights like a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of Shot of Gold, on the heels of Hear the Music,
Young's stakes-quality filly of a few years ago, makes him luckier
than most ``small'' owners. The nice thing is, he knows he's lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very fortunate,'' said Young, 39, who spends a lot
of his time coaching the baseball and softball teams of his
children, Clayton, 12, and Brynne, 16.
</P>
<P>
   His experience with baseball and horse racing, two of the many
sports competing for the entertainment dollar, gives Young a unique
perspective on the challenges that tracks face these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in places like Santa Anita and Del Mar, even Churchill
Downs and some of the spots in New York, racing is always going to
flourish just because of the people who are involved,'' he said.
``But some of the other (smaller) tracks, it's going to be hard to
keep the quality there.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think one of the hardest things is to keep the public
perception (positive). I think people want to believe racing is
fixed. When you see things like sponging and clenbuterol, it leaves
a sour taste in people's mouths,'' Young said, referring to the
recent Kentucky incidents, where pieces of sponge were inserted
illegally in horses' nostrils before races, and to drug
controversies nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only so much money that people have to spend. I think
more so than going to baseball games and football games, the racing
dollar is being spent on (lotteries) and on these casinos that are
popping up.''
</P>
<P>
   Young thinks the racing industry's new ad campaign is a step in
the right direction. ``I like the `Go Baby Go' thing. I think you
really have to publicize it and make people believe it's the sport
of kings that it was in the glamour days. If baseball can live
through a strike that left such a bitter taste, then racing can
make a solid comeback.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, himself, is a good advertisement for the sport. He told a
Hollywood Park publicist this week that if he could, he'd trade his
All-Star and World Series experiences for a victory in the Swaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everybody can win a baseball game,'' he said. ``So go out
and own a horse, and have the same thrill.''

CLINTON AIDES SCRAMBLE TO FIGHT RULING THAT SECRET SERVICE AGENTS
MUST TESTIFY 

</HEADLINE>
 7/17-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration scrambled Thursday to
fend off an appeals court ruling compelling Secret Service agents
to cooperate with the grand jury investigating an alleged
presidential affair with an intern and a possible cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour after the U.S. Court of Appeals sternly
rebuked the effort by the Justice Department to keep the
president's protectors from testifying, agency lawyers hustled to
the Supreme Court and asked Chief Justice William Rehnquist to
intervene.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department faced a deadline of noon Friday, set by
the appeals court, to convince Rehnquist or another justice to
block the subpoenas until the entire Supreme Court can consider the
case, probably sometime after the court's new term begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, an earlier ruling by a three-judge appeals court
panel will prevail, and independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
prosecutors can begin questioning several Secret Service employees
about what they saw or heard while protecting the president. Among
those subpoenaed is the chief of President Clinton's personal
security detail.
</P>
<P>
   Starr wants Secret Service employees to provide the grand jury
with information about any attempt by Clinton or his associates to
keep secret alleged sexual encounters with White House aides Monica
Lewinsky and Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service, a branch of the Treasury Department that is
represented by the Justice Department, want the courts to recognize
a privilege of confidentiality that protects employees from having
to testify. That argument _ characterized by one appeals court
judge as ``a constitutional absurdity'' _ has been rejected by U.S.
District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson and a three-judge appeals
panel.
</P>
<P>
   When the administration on Tuesday asked the full appeals court
to review the three-judge panel's decision, Starr fired off a
letter to Attorney General Janet Reno complaining that the appeal
was designed to delay the grand jury investigation. At the same
time, Starr issued subpoenas for seven Secret Service employees,
including Larry Cockell, Clinton's top bodyguard, to appear
Thursday before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Justice Department lawyers asked Johnson to issue
a stay blocking the subpoenas. Not only did Johnson reject the
request, she upbraided Justice Department lawyers for trying to
stall Starr's inquiry. Justice lawyers then asked the three-judge
panel for a stay.
</P>
<P>
   Despite one published report that Rehnquist was asked to
intervene on Wednesday, the justice was notified late that day
that, if turned down by the interim appeals court, the
administration would ask him to block the subpoenas until the issue
of a Secret Service privilege could be decided by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, Cockell, who often stands at the president's
shoulder and accompanies him to meetings, arrived at the federal
courthouse with six colleagues and their attorneys. Cockell's
presence overshadowed the sixth day of testimony by Linda Tripp,
the woman whose taped conversations with Lewinsky triggered the
investigation six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   While Justice Department lawyers pleaded for a stay from the
appeals court, the Secret Service agents stood in a hallway outside
the grand jury room where Tripp was testifying. A little over an
hour later, the stay was granted and the president's bodyguards
left, some of them returning to their posts at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   At midafternoon, the appeals court issued its decision refusing
to review the work of the three-judge panel. The appeals court
noted that nine of the 11 judges on the court did not want to take
the case. Two others were out of the city. For the case to be
considered by the full court, six judges would have to agree to the
review.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the appeals court also signaled that the
administration was fighting a losing battle in its effort to have
the courts recognize the so-called protective function privilege.
The Justice Department's ``likelihood of success before the Supreme
Court is insufficient to warrant further delay in the grand jury's
investigation,'' the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Thursday, the Secret Service reassigned Cockell to other
duties at the White House until the issue of privilege is resolved,
officials said. The agency gave his job as Clinton's chief
bodyguard to Brian Stafford, who headed the executive security
detail before Cockell. The agency said Cockell will return to his
post once the legal fight is resolved. &QL;

WEST TO REMAIN AS LAKERS G.M.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a change of heart inspired by his boss' change of monetary
policy, Jerry West has decided to fulfil the final year of his
contract with the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   West had planned to announce his retirement from the team on
August 31, but Laker owner Jerry Buss recently handed over to West
the remaining amount more than $2 million of the $5 million bonus
he had awarded the long-time executive in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Buss had been paying off the bonus in deferred payments, much to
West's private distress.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, West had become so upset that he let it known he
wouldn't be returning to the team next season unless Buss gave him
the rest of his bonus money in one lump sum.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Buss has given in to West's demand.
</P>
<P>
   But West was not offered a new contract, and I'll be surprised
if he remains with the Lakers beyond the 1998-99 season. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Fox Dodgers did treat Fred Claire with class in at least one
vital area. They already have cut a check to him for the remaining
two years left on his contract. ...
</P>
<P>
   Ran into Mitch Kupchak the other day at The Pyramid where he was
taking in a few FILA Summer Pro League games. Because of the NBA
lockout, the Laker general manager isn't allowed to talk to any NBA
players, coaches, assistant coaches, or player agents.
</P>
<P>
   He also can't talk about the lockout with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   So, natch, we wound up discussing the subject of the hour
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That France win over Brazil was spectacular,'' said Kupchak,
as we yawningly watched a team from China beat an American
aggregation before fewer than 100 spectators. ...
</P>
<P>
   When I met with famed Hollywood super agent Michael Ovitz Monday
afternoon at his Beverly Hills office, I was tempted to ask him if
he felt a sense of cultural guilt for being responsible for the
careers of Steven Seagal and Sly Stallone. Sheepishly, I stuck to
stadium issues. ...
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea if a stadium ever will be built in Carson. But if
the one Ovitz is proposing ever is, it will be the finest football
structure in America and Carson suddenly will become a big player
in the 21st century on the Southern California sporting landscape.
...
</P>
<P>
   Those movers and shakers in the broadcasting industry sure seem
more forgiving with Marv Albert than they were with Ben Wright and
Jimmy (The Greek) Snyder. ...
</P>
<P>
   I can't think of a more unappetizing boxing match than the one
now scheduled for January 23 between those two haplessly
over-the-hill former heavyweight champions, George Foreman and
Larry Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, come to think of it, yes I can.
</P>
<P>
   What about the fraud that Bob Arum will peddle to the public on
September 18 between Cheese Champion Oscar De La Hoya and Julio
Cesar Chavez, who's so old and pathetic that he shouldn't even be
granted a license by the Nevada State Athletic Commission. This
hoax graphically sums up just how low boxing has descended. ...
</P>
<P>
   A rarity a legitimate fight actually will take place Monday
night at the Forum when that promising heavyweight, Ed Mahone
(17-0-1), will defend his NABO heavyweight title against Daniel
Netto (25-12-l). ...
</P>
<P>
   I should be tarred, feathered and hung upside down so my brains
will return to my head for deciding to see the latest ``Lethal
Weapon'' movie. In the long and glorious history of American film,
this one might be the most poorly written, most vacuously acted,
most absurdly plotted, most embarrassing piece of high-priced dung
ever to appear on the big screen. It's an indictment of my awful
escapism tastes that I would stoop to watch such drivel that is
insulting to a human being's intelligence. ...
</P>
<P>
   Defrocked Dodger manager Bill Russell and his wife, Dr. Susan
Giarrantano, made an unexpected appearance at the Long Beach State
campus Tuesday to meet with athletic director Bill Shumard, an old
friend of Russell's from his days as a publicist with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Shumard was absent. ...
</P>
<P>
   I don't care what happens from now on, but Terry Collins gets my
vote as A.L. Manager of the Year for his keeping this pitching-poor
Angel team in first place. ..
</P>
<P>
   For Tom Lasorda's peace of mind, I'm hoping Jeff Shaw decides to
re-sign with the Dodgers and Paul Konerko turns out to be a bust in
Cincinnati. It'll be embarrassing to Tommy if neither happens. ...
</P>
<P>
   Sports agents lose me when they start whining about the plight
of jocks earning a ``mere'' $250,000 a year. ...
</P>
<P>
   Would the Angels like to have back Dante Bichette and Damion
Easley?. ...
</P>
<P>
   I don't ever recall a baseball team in my lifetime that's been
more consistent than the New York Yankees have been so far this
season. ...
</P>
<P>
   If Lawrence Phillips weren't an exceptional running back, he'd
be doing jail time for all his indiscretions with women. ...
</P>
<P>
   I remember a long ago time when I'd be excited about the start
of the NFL training camps because I covered the Los Angeles Rams
for the old Herald Examiner. Now I'm overcome by numbing
indifference. ...
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Johnnie Cochran will hold a press conference today at
halftime of the 12:15 p.m. game between Hoop Mecca and Team Cochran
at The Pyramid. He will announce he's signed to represent Illinois
State basketball star Rico Hill. O.J. Simpson isn't expected to be
present. ...
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the big NASCAR weekend at the California
Speedway for me will be Saturday in the Craftsman Truck Series
watching Jerry Glanville attempt to tool around the track. If
Glanville is as bad a driver as he is a football announcer, he'll
be thrown out for reckless driving before he finishes the first
lap. ...

   TV/Radio: TBS, 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: LHP Tom Glavine (12-4, 2.85; 1-0,
2.83 lifetime vs Brewers) vs. LHP Brad Woodall (4-4, 3.61; 0-0,
18.00 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Throughout his seven years in the Braves' system, Woodall
was most often compared to Glavine. He pitches low and away, lives
by the changeup and then throws for the fists every once in a
while. But the comparisons stopped once Woodall made it to Atlanta.
A force in the International League, Woodall compiled a 41-31
record with Richmond, but was 3-4 with 6.50 ERA in 18 appearances
in Atlanta, dating to 1994. He finally left the organization last
winter and was invited to the Brewers' camp as a non-roster player.
Although he didn't make the club when camp broke, he made it to
Milwaukee by May and will be making his eighth start tonight.
Woodall is 2-3 as a starter, but all three losses were sustained
when the Brewers scored two or fewer runs. His ERA is distorted,
too, after Cleveland hit him for six earned runs on July 2. Woodall
faced the Braves in two innings of relief June 2 in Milwaukee and
got blasted on an Andruw Jones solo homer and a three-run shot by
Andres Galarraga.

 &HT;    The center of attention
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Mark Wohlers returned to the major leagues on
Thursday from his self-induced, nearly four-week exile to the
minors, claiming he still had confidence but without the closer's
role he has filled for the past four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a little nervous (on returning),'' Wohlers said. ''I
felt like a rookie walking into the clubhouse for the first time.
It was embarrassing. It's embarrassing to go back down to the minor
leagues. You don't hear of too many guys who want to go back
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers left Atlanta on May 20, hoping to rediscover the control
and velocity that helped him become one of baseball's most feared
closers over the past three seasons. After nearly a month on the
farm, though, his numbers at Class AAA -- an 0-2 record with a
21.60 ERA in eight games -- created more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   ''In his own mind, he got around the plate more,'' Braves
manager Bobby Cox said. ''I guess you can throw those statistics
out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers says his struggles on the mound don't compare to the
personal crisis he has endured over the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, while Wohlers struggled through one of the worst
outings of his career, surrendering seven earned runs, six hits,
two walks and four wild pitches in a (itsingle(ro inning against
Toledo, his mother suffered a heart attack in his hometown of
Holyoke, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ''Has it been tough?'' Wohlers asked. ''I go to these
minor-league cities and talk to these writers and you have to set
your ego aside. You've got to swallow your pride a little bit
because you know it's what's best for you. Has it been tough? Yes.
Has it been the toughest thing I've gone through in my life? Not
even close.
</P>
<P>
   ''People make a big deal about struggling on the baseball field
when I've got my mother hooked up in a hospital. It puts things in
perspective. I take my job very seriously. I take a lot of pride
out to the mound. There's nothing I'd rather do than help this team
win another world championship, but it's just a damn game.''
</P>
<P>
   How Wohlers immediately fits with the Braves is in long middle
relief, according to Cox, who says right-handed Kerry Ligtenberg,
who is 11-for-14 in save opportunities this season, will remain the
closer.
</P>
<P>
   With much of the attention focused on Wohlers, Ligtenberg has
largely gone unnoticed. He has 53 strikeouts in only 43 innings and
has converted both his save opportunites since the All-Star break.
Ligtenberg's 11 saves are the most for a Braves reliever other than
Wohlers since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kerry has about converted every save he's had,'' Cox said.
''He's been almost perfect. He's our closer right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers, 27, says he wants an opportunity to pitch on a regular
basis. While there has been much debate as to whether his problems
are physical -- he went on the disabled list for 20 days in May
with a partially torn left oblique muscle -- or mental, he claims
to have the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an inactive thing,'' Wohlers said. ''I wasn't pitching.
Sitting on the bench for a while will make you rusty. I just wanted
to pitch. I wasn't pitching here. That's what I accomplished (in
the minors) -- I pitched. ''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers pitched, but it certainly wasn't effective. After
working with special assignment scout Guy Hansen for 10 days at
Atlanta's spring training facility in Orlando, Wholers made eight
appearances in 17 days at Richmond. He gave up 18 earned runs and
17 hits in 7 2/3 innings. He walked 14 batters, threw six wild
pitches and gave up four home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best I felt is when I gave up seven runs in one inning,''
Wohlers said. ''I can't control those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers can control his future in Atlanta. With the July 31st
trade deadline approaching, Wohlers probably faces a stiff one-week
test. If he's unable to regain form, Atlanta general manager John
Schuerholz may be forced to acquire another closer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm proceeding like I'd ordinarly do because with (Wohler's
recovery) being an unknown, I can't make the assumption that
everything is going to be OK with Mark,'' Schuerholz said. ''And if
we happen to make an acquisition or a deal that brings another
player in that role to us, and Mark turns it around and gets it
going, well, then great. But if he doesn't, then we'll hopefully
have acquired somebody who could step in, or a combination of guys
who can strengthen us and the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers says he isn't through fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I struggled in rookie ball for two years,'' Wohlers said.
''There were plenty of times I could have thrown in the towel. I'm
going to work and get back on track.''

TESTIMONY CASTS DOUBT ON ZAMORA'S ACCOUNT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Robert Tharp 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ Diane Zamora's best friend thought Zamora
was lying when she said David Graham ``proved his love'' by killing
Adrianne Jones, the friend testified Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination on the second day of Graham's capital
murder trial, Kristina Mason said she twice told a grand jury panel
shortly after Graham's and Zamora's arrests that she did not
believe Zamora's story. Mason said Zamora confided to her about the
slaying days after Jones was found dead.
</P>
<P>
   Under direct questioning by prosecutor Mike Parrish, Mason said
she was shocked and simply did not want to believe her best
friend's story. But during defense cross-examination, which at
times was heated, Mason said that Zamora had told her she often got
attention by making up stories when she was a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the truth is at this time. ... I'm still
trying to figure out the truth, what happened that night,'' Mason
said. ``I've already been told by my best friend what happened that
night. I just want to know for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason said she did not ``begin telling the truth'' to the grand
jury until she was threatened with aggravated perjury charges. But
even after that point in her testimony, Mason told the grand jury
panel that she did not believe Zamora.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed that she believed her story, but I didn't believe
her,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   Mason's grand jury testimony included statements that Graham, a
former Air Force Academy cadet, and Zamora, a former Naval Academy
midshipman, lured Jones to a field in Grand Prairie, Texas, where
Zamora struck her with a weight and demanded, ``Shoot her, kill
her, shoot her'' to Graham after Jones stumbled away.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, 20, faces life in prison if convicted. Zamora was
convicted of capital murder in February for her role in Jones'
death and is serving a life sentence. All three were students at
Mansfield High School at the time of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Dan Cogdell said at the start of the trial that
he will prove that Zamora alone killed the 16-year-old Mansfield
High School sophomore and that Graham was not at the crime scene
and only covered up for his former fiance.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony earlier Thursday, Dr. Marc Krouse, deputy chief
Tarrant County medical examiner, described the wounds Jones
suffered, including a severe skull fracture caused by a heavy
object and two head wounds from a gun fired at a distance of less
than two inches.
</P>
<P>
   Krouse testified that the fracture was not likely to have been
caused while Jones sat inside a car, which is the way it is
detailed in Graham's and Zamora's statements to investigators.
Krouse said the pattern of the wound shows that it was probably
caused by the butt of the 9mm handgun used to kill Jones. He said
that Zamora is too small and not strong enough to generate the
force for such a blow, which pushed bone fragments one inch into
Jones' brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a heavy blow by a large person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, Krouse agreed with Cogdell that Zamora
could have generated enough force for such a blow if she had been
enraged and boosted by adrenalin.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person under the influence of adrenalin can accomplish some
amazing things; he admitted that much,'' Cogdell said outside the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Krouse also testified that Zamora's fingers are too thin to
match finger-shaped bruising found around Jones' neck. Under
cross-examination, Krouse acknowledged that Zamora's fingers would
have been wide enough had they been wrapped in bandages for an
injury that she had received in a.MDNM/ car wreck.
</P>
<P>
   In other testimony, Grand Prairie Police Sgt. Brad Geary
recounted a 4 a.m. phone call from a Grand Prairie detective who
had Graham in custody. Geary said the detective handed the phone to
Graham, who explained where he had hidden the handgun used in the
slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Graham stated to me on the telephone that the gun was
well hidden in the attic under an eave, and we'd have an extremely
hard time finding it.''
</P>
<P>
   Parrish said he plans to present more witnesses Friday and to
continue building his case through the middle of next week.

 &HT;    Gailey: `We've got a lot of work to do'
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS _ Before the new coach guarantees a spot in this
season's Super Bowl, he wanted to make something clear about the
first day of training camp at Midwestern State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to call off any practices,'' Chan Gailey said
after a two- hour workout. ``We've got a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The all-work, no-play leader of the Dallas Cowboys survived his
first day of summer camp. The coach does not dream about the NFL's
title game six months from now.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey practically ignored the pageantry of the opening practice
in Wichita Falls. He hardly noticed the blue-and-white balloons
that hovered over the practice field or the opening remarks by the
city's mayor.
</P>
<P>
   This was a day the city has been looking forward to. About 2,200
fans lined two practice fields, cheered for their favorite players,
asked for autographs and watched a team that struggled with a 6-10
record last season.
</P>
<P>
   Players wore shorts and T-shirts, hoping to beat the heat. Some
spectators who sat on metal bleachers did not adapt well to the
temperature, which reached 101 degrees by late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Eight people were treated for heat-related problems. Two were
taken to a local hospital, suffering from heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a few cool moments,'' Gailey joked later, ``when
the temperature got under 100.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys consider their monthlong stay in Wichita Falls a
business trip. They remember what it was like to lose their last
five games last season, memories they hope to erase by the time
camp ends Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on who's talking, the Cowboys will have another losing
season or make a serious run through the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could go either way,'' cornerback Kevin Smith said. ``The
players who have won here have to look at themselves. For people
like Troy (Aikman), Michael (Irvin), myself and Darren (Woodson),
it's personal.''
</P>
<P>
   The urgency of camp has been felt by others. Running back Emmitt
Smith is so bitter about last season, he won't talk publicly about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was last year,'' Smith said. ``We don't talk about last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith did note obvious changes with the Cowboys. No one
mentioned Barry Switzer's name, but his resignation and the hiring
of Gailey have put a new spin on training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's impression of Gailey?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not trying to be overbearing with the team,'' Aikman
said. ``It's not like he's trying to put his stamp on us. He's made
it very clear how things are going to be run. He's provided some
direction already.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, without question, is organized. Before camp started, he
scripted every minute of all 34 practice sessions, including
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The adulation the fans shower upon the players is not one of
Gailey's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of it. If I say it's good, that's not going to
change anything,'' Gailey said. ``We are the Dallas Cowboys and
there is a sense of excitement and anticipation. I don't worry
about it. This is just part of the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, for one, does not crave attention. He has informed team
officials that he will not conduct press conferences after
practices for the rest of camp. Instead, he will have one
question-and-answer session per day, in mid- afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if this was a ``significant'' day for him, Gailey
shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not for me,'' he said. ``It's significant for the team,
though. This was our first day of work in our journey.''
</P>
<P>
   The players appear to like Gailey's serious approach. Under
Switzer, many players complained that practices were too relaxed.
Players often would break team rules and not worry about
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having Chan Gailey here is fantastic,'' defensive tackle Chad
Hennings said.
</P>
<P>
   The most surprised person at camp was 7-year-old Sam Woodall. A
security guard handed the boy a yellow card with Aikman's name
typed on it midway through practice. The guard told him that he was
one of 100 kids who would be allowed to get Aikman's autograph
after practice.
</P>
<P>
   Woodall, his face beaming, responded, ``Wow, you're not kidding
me, are you?''

ZAMORA'S ATTORNEY MAY SEEK NEW TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAN JARVIS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Testimony from a new witness given during
David Graham's trial Wednesday has prompted an attorney for Diane
Zamora to consider seeking a new trial for his client, who in
February was convicted of capital murder in the death of
16-year-old Adrianne Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a possibility, but we haven't crossed that bridge yet,''
said Zamora's defense attorney, John Linebarger of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence on which Linebarger said he might base an
appeal was presented Wednesday when Wendy Bartlett, a former
cross-country teammate of Jones and Graham. Bartlett testified that
she drove Jones home from a track meet the night that Graham said
in his police confession that the two had a tryst.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Mike Parish said Wednesday that investigators were
unaware of the new witness until a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Linebarger said that he had heard rumors that there was new
evidence by a witness who would testify in Graham's trial. ``Quite
frankly, I was shocked when I heard that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Linebarger said prosecutors have never given him Bartlett's name
as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora, Graham's former fiancee, was convicted in the fatal
beating and shooting of Jones, a Mansfield High School sophomore.
Graham is on trial in New Braunfels, Texas, in that killing.
</P>
<P>
   Linebarger said he will probably ask for a hearing to supplement
the record on the appeal that has been filed in Zamora's case. To
do that, Linebarger said, he will have to file an out-of-time
motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, attorneys have 30 days after their client is found
guilty to file. But Linebarger said that based on the new evidence,
he believes he can file for a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will wait until after the Graham trial to file for a
new trial because he wants to get a transcript of the testimony.

SHAREHOLDERS FIND SOME LEVERAGE IN MERGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., July 19)  
 (JT)  
 By CAROLE GOULD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the pace of mergers and acquisitions of fund management
companies red hot, shareholder activists want to make sure
investors share in any resulting profits. And now one closed-end
fund activist has found a way to help make sure they do so.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is simple. When fund companies are acquired, management
must ask shareholders to approve new advisory agreements. That
gives shareholders leverage to force management's hand.
</P>
<P>
   George Karpus, an investment adviser in Pittsford, N.Y., who
specializes in closed-end bond funds, used this shareholders'
leverage in a recent challenge involving six of the nine taxable
bond funds run by Piper Capital Management. ``If they're going to
make all that money in the merger,'' he said, ``they should take
care of the shareholders, too.'' Karpus, who owns significant
stakes in seven Piper funds, added, ``Now we've got a lever.''
</P>
<P>
   Closed-end fund experts say his shrewd maneuvering is breaking
ground in the industry, as increasingly sophisticated investors
look for ways to challenge management companies when shares trade
at discounts to the value of their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike mutual funds, whose unlimited numbers of shares are
bought and sold at net asset value, closed-end funds have a set
number of shares that are bought and sold on stock markets.
Although shares can trade at a premium to the value of the
securities held by the funds, they typically trade at discounts,
and when the discount widens, shareholders take notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wide discounts are attracting more sophisticated investors to
closed-end funds,'' said Cecilia L. Gondor, executive vice
president of Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, closed-end fund
specialists in Miami. ``It is inevitable that we will see
increasingly creative ways of persuading management to narrow
persistent discounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Piper's parent, the Piper Jaffray Companies,
agreed to be acquired by U.S. Bancorp, requiring Piper Capital
Management to ask shareholders in each of its funds to approve a
new advisory contract. In mid-January, Karpus filed a shareholder
proposal recommending that his company, Karpus Investment
Management, be hired as replacement manager for six Piper funds _
American Select Portfolio, American Strategic Income Portfolios II
and III, American Opportunity Income, American government Income
Portfolio and the Americas Income Trust _ setting the stage for a
proxy battle. His goal was to force Piper to deal with the
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   The funds had long traded at discounts; Americas Income Trust,
for example, had a discount as deep as 19 percent last year, while
those for the American Select Portfolio and Strategic Income
Portfolio II hit 15 percent, Ms. Gondor said.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of a still-unresolved shareholder fight involving the
Zurich Group's acquisition of Scudder, Piper sought to avoid a
similar proxy fight with Karpus' group by announcing in March steps
that management would take to narrow the discounts in the American
Strategic Income Portfolios II and III and in the American Select
Portfolio _ provided that shareholders approve the new investment
contracts related to the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Piper would ask the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow
each fund to make annual repurchase offers of up to 10 percent of
the outstanding shares if the discount exceeded 5 percent in a
specified 12-week period. Otherwise, the funds would buy up to 10
percent of each of the funds' outstanding shares in December 1999
and December 2001, if the average discount exceeded 5 percent
during the 12 calendar weeks preceding Oct. 1 of those years.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to deal with discounts is to open the funds. In
April, the Piper board approved the conversion of three funds _
American government Income, American government Income Portfolio
and American Opportunity Income _ into a single open-end fund. It
also approved a plan to fold the Highlander Income fund and
Americas Income Trust into a new open-end fund, the First American
Strategic Income fund.
</P>
<P>
   In response to these moves, Karpus' group withdrew its
shareholder proposals.
</P>
<P>
   On July 10, shareholders overwhelmingly approved the new
advisory contracts for Americas Income Trust and Highlander Income.
Shareholder votes on new advisory contracts for the remaining seven
funds are scheduled for August.

N.Y. REGENTS END LIFETIME LICENSING FOR TEACHERS

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The New York State Board of Regents voted
Thursday to end lifetime licensing for teachers, but, bowing to
pressure from the teachers' union, it passed the barest of
standards for renewing those licenses. Teachers will have only to
take continuing education classes, with no current standards for
grading.

   The measure falls far short of the state Education Department's
original proposal to evaluate the performance of classroom teachers
independently every five years.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal, made by a Regents committee two years ago, would
have given New York the strictest licensing standard in the nation.
But the performance evaluations were eliminated after pressure from
the state teachers' unions, a potent lobbying force in Albany,
which argued that the state was not financially or logistically
able to evaluate its 200,000 classroom teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The new continuing education measure will apply to teachers who
will get five-year state licenses beginning in September 2000. For
renewal, teachers will have to take 175 hours of continuing
education.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to scaling back the requirements, the measure
provides a potential financial boon for unions, giving them
millions of dollars more for themselves and their members, because
unions are paid to provide many of the classes and because school
districts pay teachers to attend them. (In New York City, they get
$13.40 an hour.)
</P>
<P>
   Union officials and regents hailed the new licensing rules.
State Education Commissioner Richard Mills hailed the regents' plan
as a valuable tool for raising standards. ``The regents have issued
a challenge to well-prepared, able committed people who should be
teachers,'' he said at a news conference Thursday afternoon. ``I
hope they have heard the call. And I hope they respond to the
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   But some school board representatives and school superintendents
said they did not go far enough. And New York City Schools
Chancellor Rudy Crew, through a spokeswoman, raised a concern that
the measure might cost ``several hundred million dollars over the
course of the next five years,'' which the Legislature has not
appropriated.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In trying to overhaul teacher licensing, New York follows a
national movement to re-examine how teachers are trained and
monitored through their career. New York has long been among a
handful of states to issue lifetime licenses. Most states require
teachers to renew their teaching certificates every few years by
taking college courses or professional development seminars,
according to the Education Commission of the States, a nonprofit
policy and research organization in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The regents also voted to close teachers' colleges whose
graduates have trouble passing the state teachers' exams, a measure
that threatens several City University campuses, and they raised
the academic credentials to be required of new teachers. Those who
begin teaching in September 2000 will need to earn a master's
degree within two years of starting; they now have five years.
</P>
<P>
   And the regents also gave state education officials more grounds
to suspend or revoke teaching licenses, including ``incompetence,
neglect of duty and insubordination.'' Currently, state education
officials can revoke a license only for ``lack of good moral
character.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally districts try to dismiss teachers for incompetence
first, through Civil Service proceedings. Such actions are rare: in
the 1995-96 school year, the latest for which statistics were
available, school officials sought to dismiss 156 teachers, and 24
of them were found to be incompetent, according to department
spokesman Alan Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said that improving teachers' performance was
important as the state raised academic requirements. ``The plan is
a step forward in raising standards for students,'' said Antonia
Cortese, the vice president of New York State United Teachers, the
umbrella group for the state's teachers' unions. ``It moves the
whole system to recognize that it has to invest its teachers. They
are closest to the students.''
</P>
<P>
   Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of
Teachers, the New York City teachers' union, said: ``It now forces
the districts to offer professional development in a meaningful way
and related to what teachers are doing in the classrooms. It's more
like the things we have been advocating for and we've been
offering.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Kinley, the acting executive director of the New York State
School Boards Association, called the plan a ``good first step''
toward maintaining teacher accountability and high standards. But
he added that his group wanted the measure to apply to people now
teaching, not just the next generation of teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the current law, this is as much as the Regents could
do, so we're pleased,'' he said. ``But we're going to continue to
hit the Legislature for more.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing education courses are generally technical courses
ranging from classroom discipline to developing curriculum. They
are now voluntary, but teachers have an incentive to take them
because they get graduated pay increases as they attain set levels
of credits. Under the new rules, individual school districts must
pick up the cost of the additional courses instead of the teachers
themselves, as was often the case in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the professional development centers of the
United Federation of Teachers gave classes to some 12,000 of its
70,000 active members last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the UFT is a virtual university,'' Ms. Weingarten
said. ``We look to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Johnson of Long Island, who is co-chairman of the
Regents' Task Force on Teaching, which drafted and then modified
the new rules, said state officials estimated that the new
requirements would cost about $100 million a year. But he noted
that much of that could be paid for with money that the Legislature
had already appropriated for school staff development.
</P>
<P>
   The Regents' Task Force on Teaching had initially proposed that
teachers' licenses be renewed based on performance evaluations in
the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   In a draft proposal in the spring of 1997, the regents
recommended that teachers be evaluated by a team of experts from
outside each school. That measure faced vigorous opposition from
the state teachers' union, who argued that principals should
continue to evaluate teachers and move to dismiss them, if they are
found to be incompetent, but that should not affect their license
to teach elsewhere in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Several months later, after a series of public meetings around
the state and intensive lobbying by union officials, the Regents
scrapped the idea and introduced the continuing education measure,
under which a teacher can lose his or her license for failing to
complete the required hours of professional development.
</P>
<P>
   According to the rules passed Friday, state education officials
must also establish standards by which teachers are evaluated each
year by the local school district. Those who perform poorly must
undergo remedial training through a state-supervised plan.
Currently, teachers have to be evaluated each year by the district,
but the process is widely viewed as toothless.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also imposes stiffer requirements on teacher
education programs at colleges and universities throughout New York
state. Beginning in 1999, the state will decertify programs if
fewer than 80 percent of their students pass the three licensing
exams given by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 25 of the state's 113 teacher education programs
would have failed the new requirement, including 8 colleges in the
City University system. For instance, at Medgar Evers College, 41
percent passed the test in 1996-1997, and 52 percent passed at York
College; but 88 percent passed at Queens College, 83 percent at
Staten Island and 78 percent at Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   The regents' plan also calls for the creation of a teacher
recruitment program that offers scholarships to graduate and
undergraduate students in exchange for their commitment to teach in
impoverished schools. It also offers $10,000 bonuses for teachers
who agree to teach in such schools. But in both cases, the
financing would have to be approved by the governor and the state
Legislature.

RAND TO ASSESS HOW FEDERAL SAFETY BOARD RUNS CRASH INQUIRIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (sw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD  
c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Transportation Safety Board has asked
a research organization to analyze its operations and determine
whether it maintains the proper relationship with airlines, plane
manufacturers, the Federal Aviation Administration and other
parties in its investigations of crashes.
</P>
<P>
   In a first outside examination of the board, the organization,
Rand Corp., will begin assessing how well the system works when it
meets rivately on Friday in Santa Monica, Calif., with about 35
experts from outside the board.
</P>
<P>
   James Hall, the chairman of the five-member board, said in a
speech last week that its system was ``stressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The board is a small, independent agency created by Congress
that assumes a towering profile whenever a major transportation
accident occurs in the air, on the rails or at sea. But it does not
conduct investigations; it directs them, using the people,
expertise and equipment of other government agencies, the pilots'
unions and the companies involved in the accident, like TWA,
Valujet and Boeing. Those parties have money or prestige riding on
the outcome of the investigations.
</P>
<P>
   This ``party system'' has worked well in the 31 years since the
board was created, officials say. But Hall said that since the
Valujet crash in the Everglades and the TWA Flight 800 crash off
Long Island, which killed a total of 340 people in 1996, the board
``has been challenged like never before, especially by the news
media.''
</P>
<P>
   A major complaint is that the entities that might have caused a
crash are deeply involved in the investigation. Another is that
every interest except the victims' is represented in the party
system.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a federal commission led by Norman Mineta, a former
congressman from California, suggested that the parties, now
limited to participation in the fact-gathering stage of the
investigation, should participate in analysis, too.
</P>
<P>
   Another board member, who would not allow her name to be used,
said the party system, while useful, had a ``fox-in-the-henhouse
appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   But the system has advantages, experts say. A top FAA official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the board ``has never
been flush with talent or numbers; they don't have the level of
expertise we do in engines, or air traffic control, or aircraft
certification.'' As a result, the board has had to rely on outside
talent, often from the FAA, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, the agency official said, board investigators were skilled
generalists. ``Often what you need is somebody who knows so little,
they don't know right questions to ask, so they ask everything, or
they say `Gee, this could be a crazy idea, but what about this or
that,''' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Garvey, the administrator of the FAA, which is the
recipient of most of the board's aviation recommendations, said in
an interview, ``The party system certainly serves the American
people well, but it's over three decades old.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's absolutely appropriate to step back, take a look
and the system and see if it can be improved,'' Ms. Garvey said,
praising the board for taking on the issue. She is scheduled to
attend a session later in the process.

FBI SEEKS ACCESS TO MOBILE PHONE LOCATIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh has asked members of the Senate
Appropriations Committee to add language to the Justice Department
appropriations bill that would require telephone companies to
provide police agencies with the precise location of cellular phone
users, in some cases without a court order.
</P>
<P>
   After learning last week of Freeh's meeting with committee
members, civil liberties groups and the telecommunications industry
began marshaling opposition. Privacy advocates say the proposal is
a dangerous and unconstitutional invasion of privacy, and the
telecommunications industry predicts that implementing such a law
would cost billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno is scheduled to meet Friday with
Federal Communications Commission director William Kennard to make
the FBI's case that such legislation is needed if the agency is to
stay current with an evolving technology that enables criminals to
use mobile phones to avoid detection.
</P>
<P>
   Most alarming to civil liberties advocates is a provision in the
proposed amendment that would allow police agencies to demand the
location of a cellular phone user without a court order in certain
``emergencies,'' defined broadly as the suspicion of a felony, the
pursuit of a fugitive or instances in which human safety is deemed
to be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The advanced technology that would enable the kind of tracking
that the FBI is seeking is now being deployed nationwide to permit
911 emergency service centers to ascertain the exact location of
cellular callers. Such systems use a triangulation scheme that
measures variances in signal strength to calculate the location of
a phone user within an area roughly equal to that of a football
field.
</P>
<P>
   But while the 911 centers would only track a caller who had
dialed for emergency help, the technology permits phone companies
to get location information on any cellular phone that is turned on
and operating within the cellular network, whether or not the user
is actually making a call.
</P>
<P>
   It is this information to which the FBI is demanding access.
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties scholars and cellular telephone industry
executives say they believe that the agency has crossed an
important line and is asking for broad new powers that potentially
raise a ``Big Brother'' specter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Orwellian,'' said Tom Wheeler, president of the
Cellular Telephone Industry Association. ``This is about revising
the Bill of Rights via a congressional appropriations bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has also raised concerns among constitutional
scholars who view the language of the proposed amendment as overly
broad and a violation of the Fourth Amendment's protections against
illegal searches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very close to a dragnet search, and I'm not clear you
should be able to do this even with a warrant,'' said Richard
Epstein, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School. ``I
think they've gone too far on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials insist that the agency is merely attempting to
keep up with rapidly changing technology that is confounding law
enforcement agencies with new communications systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We attempted to balance privacy concerns with the needs of law
enforcement,'' said Barry Smith, a spokesman for the FBI ``We're
just as concerned about protecting the Fourth Amendment as anyone
else. But when this is needed to solve a crime, we need to get the
information.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The proposed amendment would also streamline the legislative
review process, narrowing the opportunity for public comment. Under
the 1994 law, that process is now overseen by the FCC. Among the
issues that fall under that review process are the limits of
surveillance by police agencies on future data networks.
</P>
<P>
   Both privacy groups and industry executives say the proposed
legislation would strip away congressionally mandated public
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to eliminate the whole concept of public
accountability,'' said James Dempsey, a telecommunications expert
at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington-based
privacy rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy rights groups have been particularly angered because
until recently, FBI officials had stated publicly that law
enforcement agencies had no interest in precise location
information.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the agency is saying that because changing
technology has made such information possible, law enforcement
officials should have access to it.

 WOODS, HUSTON SHARE FIRST ROUND LEAD AT BRITISH OPEN WITH 65's   By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ Earlier this month, Tiger Woods borrowed a
putter from his close friend, Mark O'Meara. Woods still hasn't
returned it. And after Thursday's performance by Woods, O'Meara may
never get his putter back.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoying his strongest round at a major this year, Woods shot a
five-under-par 65 and shared the lead with John Huston after the
opening round of the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Couples, a two-time winner this year, was in a three-way
tie for third place at 66, along with Loren Roberts and Nick Price,
a former British Open champion (1994) who was paired with Woods
Thursday. Davis Love 3d, Robert Allenby, Brad Faxon, Fredrick
Jacobson and Vijay Singh were in a five-way tie for sixth place at
67.
</P>
<P>
   With a huge gallery following his every move through the dunes
and tall grass at Royal Birkdale Golf Club, Woods looked
comfortable, confident and in control of his game, giving a strong
indication that, at the age of 22, he may be ready to win his
second major.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Woods is in contention he adds electricity to the
surroundings, but Thursday amid that charged atmosphere he showed
patience, strong course management and a solid putting stroke that
allowed him to capitalize on birdie opportunities. And with
temperatures in the high 60s, only a mild breeze and bright
sunshine, the leaders took advantage of conditions that were much
more favorable than earlier in the week, when the wind gusted to 40
miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Woods is the world's No. 1-ranked player, many
wondered if he had the experience to win a major on a course that
demands precision and creative shot-making. But Thursday, Woods,
the 1997 Masters champion, looked at ease, and his improved short
game and distance control were critical. He used his driver only
four times, relying on irons off the tee to keep the ball in play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an evolution process that every player goes
through,'' said Woods, who had seven birdies and just two bogeys.
``Any player back in their early 20s and teens hits the ball pretty
hard. As they get older, they learn to control their game. I'm no
exception to that _ still learning a lot of different shots. Over
all, I'm very pleased with my progress.''
</P>
<P>
   If Woods wins, he will owe a thank you to O'Meara, his Orlando,
Fla., neighbor and this year's Masters champion, who is one of the
game's best putters. During a practice round in Orlando last week,
the day before Woods and O'Meara left for Europe, O'Meara lent
Woods a backup Ping putter. O'Meara shot a 63 that day, but he
still lost money to Woods, who shot a 62.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has been using the putter ever since, and Thursday, he
used it to make a 12-foot birdie putt on No. 5, a 20-foot birdie
putt on No. 7 and a 30-foot birdie putt on No. 13. He followed that
with birdies on two par 5's, the 15th and the 17th. No wonder Woods
won't part with the putter.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the practice green yesterday, Mark asked Tiger what would
happen if somebody stole his putter and he needed his backup putter
back,'' said Butch Harmon, Woods' coach. ``Tiger says, `If somebody
steals your putter, you'll have to go to the pro shop and buy
another one, because I'm not giving this one up.'''
</P>
<P>
   Huston was the only player who could keep pace with Woods, and
his round featured one of the torrid stretches that have marked
Huston's career. After making nine consecutive pars on the front
nine, Huston caught fire on the back nine, making birdies at Nos.
10, 11 and 12, then finishing with a bang _ a 40-foot putt for
eagle on the par-5 17th, followed by another birdie at No. 18, when
he hit a gorgeous 7-iron approach shot out of the rough to within
four feet.
</P>
<P>
   Huston, a low-profile, 37-year-old veteran who has won four
times on the PGA Tour, is having the best year of his career,
showing an ability to shoot low numbers. While winning the Hawaiian
Open in February, Huston set the PGA Tour 72-hole scoring record
(28 under). He has contended consistently since January, when he
began sleeping on a magnetic mattress cover, which alleviated the
pain caused by tendinitis in his right wrist and bursitis in his
left shoulder. Huston travels with the mattress cover, and
considering how well he has played, who can blame him?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's supposed to increase your blood flow, so it heals the
body faster,'' Huston said. ``It took a couple, three days before I
started feeling no pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The only times Woods felt pain Thursday occurred on No. 12, when
he missed a three-foot putt for his first bogey, and on No. 18,
when he missed an eight-foot par putt that cost him sole possession
of the lead. But Woods showed an ability to escape trouble,
avoiding the calamities that cost him during last year's British
Open at Royal Troon Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Despite shooting a 64 on Saturday last year, Woods finished 12
strokes behind Justin Leonard, and Woods' demise could be traced to
four holes _ a quadruple bogey, two triple bogeys and a double
bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Woods was far more resilient. On No. 2, after hitting
his drive into the deep right rough, Woods hit perhaps his best
shot of the day, a remarkable 9-iron from a terrible lie that
carried about 120 yards over a greenside bunker and stopped 10 feet
from the hole, allowing Woods to make a par-saving putt.
</P>
<P>
   And when Woods could use his power to his advantage, he did. On
the par-4, 411-yard ninth hole he unloaded his longest drive of the
day, a 380-yard rocket that landed just a few yards short of the
green, leading to a birdie. It was an impressive round of power and
patience that the astute British fans appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of golf yet to be played, and many strong
players are in contention. But after failing to contend on Sunday
at both the Masters and the United States Open this year, Woods
opened the year's third major by immediately making his presence
felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ovation I got at 18, I haven't had that in a long time,''
Woods said. ``It felt really good.''

ADVERTISING: THE POSTAL SERVICE TAKES RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Postal Service is one of the most recognizable national
symbols, so if it were to lend its name to a single team sport,
that sport would naturally be _ cycling?
</P>
<P>
   Well, perhaps cycling _ that is, bicycle racing _ is not the
first sport that leaps to mind. But the Postal Service believes
that putting its name on the only American-based squad to compete
in the Super Bowl of cycling _ the Tour de France _ makes a lot of
sense.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that cycling is popular. The 2,400-mile-long
Tour, which began last Saturday and finishes Aug. 2 with the
traditional sprint down the Champs Elysees in Paris, is televised
in 120 countries and is reckoned by its organizers to be the
third-most-watched sporting event after the World Cup soccer
tournament and the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Postal Service, professional cycling is
just not that widely followed in the United States, where most of
its customers happen to be.
</P>
<P>
   While interest in cycling has been growing in this country since
the Postal Service first began sponsoring the team, U.S. Postal,
two years ago, it is still far from the national passion it is in
Europe. In many American newspapers, the Tour is still relegated to
the back pages of the sports sections _ if it receives any coverage
at all.
</P>
<P>
   And it does not help that U.S. Postal's marquee rider, Lance
Armstrong, a former world champion who returned to racing this year
after a bout with testicular cancer, is still not strong enough to
ride in the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The team's other backers, which include Visa International and
Trek Bicycle Corp., make perfect sense. So why did the Postal
Service choose to become the team's title sponsor, paying more than
$1 million a year for the privilege?
</P>
<P>
   ``The bike has been part of postal history and tradition for
quite a long time,'' said Margot Myers, a Postal Service
spokeswoman. ``We still have quite a few letter carriers that use
bikes to deliver mail in many parts of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   A more compelling reason may be that $1 million for the kind of
exposure the Postal Service is getting is cheap even if a
relatively small number of Americans will notice.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service team is already generating more attention
than expected because of the surprisingly strong showing of George
Hincapie, the U.S. national road racing champion, who is currently
second in the Tour's overall standings, only seven seconds behind
the leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service sponsors several baseball teams like the
Yankees and the Mets. And it could hardly resist doing a promotion
with the Utah Jazz star Karl Malone, who is known as the Mailman.
But a leaguewide deal with baseball, football or basketball is
beyond its means.
</P>
<P>
   Not so cycling. ``This is really our franchise sport,'' said
Robert McKenna, manager of sponsorships for the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsorship deal with Montgomery Sports, which owns and
manages the cycling team, was put together by D&AMP;F Group, a
corporate sports marketing agency in Washington. When the Postal
Service was first presented with the idea in 1995, it was looking
for a way to promote its expanding international services, such as
express packages sent overseas and logistics services for customers
that mail many packages abroad like the catalog marketer L.L. Bean.
</P>

   Using the themes of teamwork and speed, Young &AMP; Rubicam
Advertising created a television spot featuring cyclists wearing
the U.S. Postal team jerseys cycling in different locales around
the world. It ran last year on Walt Disney Co.'s ESPN sports
channel, which showed highlights of each of the race's daily
stages.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because the U.S. Postal team competes in numerous races around
the United States, the Postal Service has also used the events to
build morale among its own employees and to reach out to various
communities.
</P>
<P>
   In January, when the team held a training camp in Southern
California, 15 Postal Service employees who are amateur racers got
to ride with Armstrong and the rest of the team to the main postal
processing facility in San Diego, where they were feted at a kind
of pep rally with other employees.
</P>
<P>
   But even those benefits did not seem to justify the expense
internally, Ms. Myers said. This year, the Postal Service assigned
a special sales team to use the sponsorship to drum up business.
</P>
<P>
   Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities, the Nationsbank division that
spawned Montgomery Sports, transferred some of its delivery
business to the Postal Service. Nashbar, a catalog company that is
another of the team's sponsors, ended up giving the Postal Service
new business that Nashbar says will amount to $1.1 million this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have contracts in place that are for sales worth more the
annual fee for the sponsorship,'' Ms. Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Postal Service has decided not to buy time
this year on ESPN, which will again have daily coverage of the
Tour, or on ABC, which will broadcast weekend coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``ESPN coverage would have been nice, but we would have been
overextended,'' McKenna said. Instead, the money will be spent
sponsoring more professional races in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That has not discouraged ESPN from focusing a lot of its
coverage on U.S. Postal. Hincapie's early success has helped lift
the ratings for the cable network's Tour coverage by one-tenth of a
point, to about 400,000 homes, an ESPN spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The result is even more visibility for U.S. Postal's snazzy blue
jerseys emblazoned with the same eagle logo found on the uniforms
of thousands of American letter carriers.

BUSH REFUSES TO FILE DONOR LIST ELECTRONICALLY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Since winning election in 1994, Gov. George W.
Bush has refused to file an electronic copy of his political donor
list with the Texas Ethics Commission so any Texan with a computer
can see who gave Bush contributions totaling more than $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, as governor, and the Legislature also have not yet
implemented a 1991 law that requires the ethics commission to make
it possible for Texans with access to a computer to see who is
giving money to any of the state's politicians.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in Florida, where Bush's brother Jeb is running for
governor, the Department of State decided to set up a campaign
database in 1995, and it was up and running by the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Now, anybody living in Houston or Dallas or Amarillo can log on
to the Florida Department of State internet site at
http://www.dos.state.fl.us and see who is giving money to Jeb Bush
or any other Florida politician. Jeb Bush voluntarily gives his
report to the Florida elections office in electronic form.
</P>
<P>
   But anybody in Houston or Dallas or Amarillo who wants to see
George W. Bush's lists of political financiers has to drive or fly
to Austin to look at a 30,000-page paper copy at the ethics
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Some candidates in Texas do file electronically, but several
others, in addition to Bush, do not.
</P>
<P>
   For someone to spend one second looking at each page of Bush's
reports, it would require more than eight hours of reading. Bush's
reports contain almost 30 times as many pages as a Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Buying a paper copy of Bush's report would cost a citizen about
$3,000, according to the ethics commission staff.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign offered an electronic copy of his most recent
report to the news media this week, but only if reporters signed a
contract agreeing not to share the electronic filing with anyone
else, including their readers or listeners in the voting public.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Chronicle refused to sign such an agreement limiting
its ability to disclose what essentially is public information.
</P>
<P>
   State law only requires campaigns to turn in their finance
reports on paper, but the ethics commission accepts electronic
reports. Those reports are posted on the Internet at
http://www.ethics.state.tx.us _ and many statewide and legislative
candidates are filing those reports.
</P>
<P>
   When he was running for governor in 1994, Bush opposed filing
his reports electronically. But then he submitted two reports to
the commission under pressure from the state's news media. Those
filings ceased as soon as Bush won office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fully disclosed all of our information so that it is
available for the public to review, but not for others to abuse,''
said Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker declined to answer any questions on the subject or
explain what she meant by ``abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of ethics reform in 1991, the Legislature passed a
law requiring that a searchable campaign finance database be up and
running at the ethics commission by January 1992. That database
still does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Many legislators have pressured the commission not to create the
database, and in 1995, both the Texas Democratic and Republican
parties sought to have the law eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the commission's eight members, including the chairman,
are Bush appointees. The others are appointed by the lieutenant
governor and House speaker.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Florida saved money when it set up the electronic system, said
Sandy Brill, data processing manager for the state elections
division.
</P>
<P>
   Brill said state prison inmates type in the data on special
interests and political action committees and state employees
handle data processing on candidate filings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can guarantee you it was a cost savings,'' Brill said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Texas's top four races _ governor, lieutenant governor,
attorney general and comptroller _ the only candidates who have not
agreed to file their reports electronically with the ethics
commission are Bush, Republican comptroller candidate Carole
Rylander and attorney general candidates John Cornyn, the
Republican, and Jim Mattox, the Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic gubernatorial candidate Garry Mauro files his reports
electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lieutenant governor candidate John Sharp was one of
the first candidates in Texas to give electronic copies of his
reports to the commission. But he stopped in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp spokesman Kelly Fero said the lapse was an oversight and
that all the missing reports will be given to the commission by
early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lieutenant governor candidate Rick Perry has never
reported electronically. Spokesman Ray Sullivan said Perry had just
never thought about filing electronically but that Thursday the
campaign was sending the commission a computer disk with all
contributions made in the current election.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Mattox said his computer was not set up to do
that.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic comptroller candidate Paul Hobby gives a computer
copy of his report to the ethics commission. Rylander, who did file
electronically in 1994, does not plan to do so this time. Rylander
campaign manager Scott McClellan said she fears the list will be
used by direct mail companies to solicit donations to other
causes. &QL;

NBC AND USA NETWORKS SAID TO HALT TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Executives at NBC and USA Networks Inc. held exploratory talks
earlier this month about a possible merger, but the talks fell
through, several executives close to the companies said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An NBC spokeswoman declined to comment Thursday and USA
Networks' chairman, Barry Diller, was out of the country and did
not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   But the executives close to the companies said that a possible
merger between NBC, which is owned by General Electric, and USA
Networks, which is partly owned by Seagram Co., never got as far as
full-fledged negotiations in part because the deal was opposed by
Seagram and another USA Networks shareholder, Liberty Media, a
company controlled by Tele-Communications Inc. The talks were
reported Friday by The Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Diller, whose company owns television stations, the Home
Shopping Network and Universal Television, has long sought a
television network. General Electric, meanwhile, has seen profits
in the network television business eroded by cable and the
Internet. NBC's future growth potential is especially clouded by
higher costs for ``ER'' and football, among other factors.
</P>
<P>
   A stock merger of NBC and USA Networks would probably have been
a tax-free transaction, experts noted Friday. But there was no
indication that General Electric had a plan to put the network up
for auction.

RECORDINGS PLAYED IN TRIAL OF 3 EX-ARCHER OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ill.) (bl) 
By KURT EICHENWALD c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A Japanese agricultural executive identified two
former senior officers of Archer Daniels Midland Co. as having met
with him in a price-fixing conspiracy, on a day when secret
government recordings of pricing discussions were played in public
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The information emerged in the first day of evidence in the
trial of three executives who worked for ADM. The testimony and
recordings underscored the deep sense of distrust and dislike among
the companies that have already pleaded guilty to conspiring to fix
the price of lysine, a feed additive.
</P>
<P>
   In one document, an Asian lysine producer raised the possibility
of bombing Archer Daniel's lysine plant, to slow the company's
entry into the business. And, on tape recordings, a Japanese
executive discussed how a Korean company that had agreed to fix
prices ``by nature will tell a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has charged the three former executives _ Michael
Andreas, the vice chairman who is on leave from the company;
Terrance Wilson, head of the company's corn processing division,
and Mark Whitacre, the head of its bioproducts division _ with
participating in the conspiracy from 1991 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The tape recordings were obtained from Whitacre, who became a
government informant less than a year after prosecutors say the
scheme involving Archer Daniels began. But he became a defendant in
the case after the government learned he had violated his
cooperation agreement by taking millions of dollars from Archer
Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   In the testimony, Kanji Mimoto, an executive with Ajinimoto Co.
of Tokyo, said that competitors in the lysine business had engaged
in price fixing long before Archer Daniels entered the market in
the early 1990s. But, he said, Archer Daniels executives were the
first to push efforts to control production volumes, which would
help guarantee the effectiveness of a price-fixing scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the discussions on production floundered, however,
because of insistence by Archer Daniels that it be assigned as much
volume as Ajinimoto, then the largest lysine producer in the
business, Mimoto said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I remember strongly, was that Terry Wilson said that as a
company policy, ADM must have the same share as the market leader''
under such an agreement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a later phone call, Mimoto said, Whitacre told him that he
was interested in increasing the price, even without a volume
agreement in place. That call took place before Whitacre began
working for the government.
</P>
<P>
   Two recorded calls with Mimoto, made by Whitacre after his
cooperation began, were played in court. At times in in recording,
the men used fictitious names. In the first, the two men haggled
over how high lysine prices should go. In the second, Mimoto
expressed concerns about meeting in the United States because of
possible legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that in the United States the antitrust statutes are
very severe,'' he said in the recording. ``So, as much as possible,
we wanted to avoid the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Reid Weingarten, a lawyer for Wilson,
presented his opening statement. In it, he said that the words of
Wilson captured on tape were not what they appeared, largely
because his client was lying to the competitors in an effort to
break up the Asian cartel.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, he cited a secretly recorded statement made by
Wilson late in the investigation that he said proved there was no
true price-fixing effort. ``If we were trying to fix prices,''
Weingarten quoted him as saying, ``Then we ought to be fired'' for
incompetence. &QL;

 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Central Intelligence Agency continued to work
with about two dozen Nicaraguan rebels and their supporters during
the 1980s despite allegations that they were trafficking in drugs,
according to a classified study by the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The new study has found that the CIA's decision to keep these
paid agents, or to continue dealing with them in some less-formal
relationship, was made by top officials at the agency's
headquarters in Langley, Va., in the midst of the war waged by the
CIA-backed Contras against Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government.
</P>
<P>
   The new report by the CIA's inspector general criticizes agency
officials' actions at the time for the inconsistent and sometimes
sloppy manner in which they investigated _ or chose not to
investigate _ the allegations, which were never substantiated by
the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report, which has not yet been publicly
released, also concludes that there is no evidence that any CIA
officials were involved in drug trafficking with Contra figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental finding of the report is that there is no
information that the CIA or CIA employees ever conspired with any
Contra organizations or individuals involved with the Contras for
purposes of drug trafficking,'' one U.S. intelligence official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new report is the long-delayed second volume of the CIA's
internal investigation into possible connections between the
Contras and Central American drug traffickers. The investigation
was originally prompted by a controversial 1996 series in The San
Jose Mercury-News, which asserted that a ``dark alliance'' among
the CIA, the Contras and drug traffickers had helped finance the
Contra war with millions of dollars in profits from drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   The second volume of the report dismisses those specific
charges, as did the first volume.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury-News series alleged that this alliance created a
drug trafficking network that was the first to introduce crack
cocaine into South Central Los Angeles. The series prompted an
enormous outcry, especially among blacks, many of whom said they
saw it as confirmation of a government-backed conspiracy to keep
blacks dependent and impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury-News subsequently admitted that the series was
flawed and reassigned the reporter.
</P>
<P>
   In the declassified version of the CIA's first volume, the
agency said the Mercury-News charges were baseless and mentioned
drug dealers who had nothing to do with the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   But John Deutch, the director of central intelligence at the
time, had also asked the inspector general to conduct a broader
inquiry to answer unresolved questions about the Contra program and
drug trafficking that had not been raised in the Mercury-News
series. Frederick Hitz, then the CIA's inspector general, decided
to issue a second, much larger report to deal with those broader
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the allegations in the second volume parallel charges
that first surfaced in a 1987 Senate investigation. The CIA is much
more reluctant to publicly release the complete text of the
approximately 500-page second volume than it was of the first,
because it deals directly with Contras the CIA did work with.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, CIA officials involved in the Contra
program were so focused on the fight against the leftist Sandinista
regime that they gave relatively low priority to collecting
information about the possible drug involvement of individuals in
the Contra army. The report concluded that CIA officers did report
on drug trafficking by the Contras, but that there were no clear
guidelines given to CIA officers in the field about how intensively
they should investigate or act upon the allegations.

about 50 figures in the Contra movement over the course of the war
against the Sandinistas, according to the report. Those allegations
were leveled against members of the Contra army as well as its air
transport and support networks. Some of the allegations may have
been specious, the result of Sandinista propaganda, while other
charges may have been more substantive, U.S. intelligence officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   It could not be determined from the CIA's records how many of
those 50 cases were fully investigated by the agency. But of those,
the CIA continued to work with about two dozen figures alleged to
be involved in the drug trade, according to U.S. intelligence
officials familiar with the report. They said the report found that
the agency was unable to either prove or disprove the charges, or
did not conduct adequate investigations into the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials, who provided information about the
report, declined to identify the individual Contras who were the
targets of the drug allegations. But they did say that while most
of the charges were leveled against individuals, the report found
that drug allegations had been made against one Contra
organization, a group known as 15th of September. That group was
formed in 1980 and was disbanded in January 1982, in the early
stages of the Contra war.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's decision to classify this second volume has already
been met with criticism on Capitol Hill. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.,
who led a 1987 congressional inquiry into allegations of Contra
drug connections, wrote a letter Thursday to CIA Director George
Tenet asking that the report be immediately declassified.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, who has reviewed the second volume of the inspector
general's report, added that he believes CIA officials involved in
the Contra program did not make a serious effort to fully
investigate the allegations of drug involvement by the Contras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us in Congress at the time, in 1985, 1986, were
calling for a serious investigation of the charges, and CIA
officials did not join in that effort,'' Kerry said. ``There was a
significant amount of stonewalling. I'm afraid that what I read in
the report documents the degree to which there was a lack of
interest in making sure the laws were being upheld.''
</P>
<P>
   CIA officials notified Congress at the time of most of the
``significant'' cases in which the agency decided to continue doing
business with those Contras accused of dealing in drugs, the report
states, but it does not detail the exact nature of the
Congressional notification.
</P>
<P>
   One former CIA official familiar with the Contra program
disputed the notion that agency officials did not take the drug
charges seriously at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You investigate all of them, and when they were credible, and
when we could substantiate them, we would certainly take action,''
the former official said. ``But wild or unproven allegations would
not by themselves be enough to displace someone from the
organization. Otherwise, we would have had no discipline or morale
in these organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of drug involvement on the part of the Contras was
hardly the only time that a group connected to the CIA has been
accused of dealing in narcotics. The agency's local allies in
Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, and in Afghanistan after the
Soviet invasion of 1979, also were accused of drug trafficking.

NEW CHANNEL NEARS KICKOFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Spread out across Jantonio Turner's desk Thursday
morning were a half-dozen logo samples that he ordered up from a
nearby graphics arts house.
</P>
<P>
   The Football Network, a 24-hour-a-day cable channel that Turner
(no relation to Ted) has spent piecing together 24 hours a day for
the last two years, already needs a new symbol. Turner, who drew
the original on his Macintosh, is taking another impromptu survey.
</P>
<P>
   Some read ``TFN'' in bold letters. Some are a little softer with
the name spelled out over a stylish football swoosh in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll probably be a combination of some of these,'' Turner
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, however, decisions aren't made slowly. The
kickoff for his cable channel, in one form or another, will be
Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   That's about a year after Turner had originally planned, and not
soon enough for most football fans. And, he says, ``this time it
will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He's easy to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, a 30-year-old TV producer who could be mistaken for
actor LeVar Burton, looks more like a wide-eyed 18-year-old who
just landed in Los Angeles looking for a proverbial shot at the big
time.
</P>
<P>
   He's honestly exuberant when he talks about all the things this
new channel can provide to viewers. He's got a pen and paper handy
to scribble down any suggestion for a show. And he's realistic when
he spells out how some things can't happen overnight, resigned to
the fact he could be on only a few hours a week to start with
buying time on another network just as some other cable channels
(such as BET and QVC) got started.
</P>
<P>
   Going with a slogan that ``Enough is NEVER enough!'' Turner's
plan for creating what some are already calling heaven on earth
seems to be, at this point, a touchdown waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Turner has avoided many of the potholes that trip upstart
networks and could well in fact be viewed in the years to come as
the visionary who took the simple idea _ if there's a Golf Channel,
why can't there be a football channel? _ and made it happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, the strength is in the power of the idea,'' said
Turner, who moved this week into a new office building just east of
the Beverly Center. ``And as long as it seems to take things to
happen, in TV, when they do happen, they happen very quickly. I
could see us maybe making a splash from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   With what he calls his ``seed money,'' Turner has planted the
idea into sponsors that this can work, and his next step is to do
the same with cable operators. Unlike the pratfall that ESPN West
took this week because it couldn't get channel space on local cable
systems, Turner has already established a relationship with a
nationwide distribution cable co-op known as NCTC, which represents
more than 5,300 cable systems with 8.5 million subscribers. Small
dish companies such as DirecTV and EchoStar should have no problem
providing room.
</P>
<P>
   Turner tried raising private funds for the venture. But since
making his channel a public corporation four months ago, his goal
of a $10 million startup budget doesn't appear as out of reach as
it once did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting this together has almost been like making a movie,''
said Turner, who has been in L.A. the last seven years working in
cable TV production and small-budget films. ``You learn to stretch
every dollar from people who invest in your project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been living a dollar above the poverty line for a while
now, but I feel I've educated myself to a point that we can do what
we say we're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   From a programming structure, the grand plan is to break it down
into five major areas:
</P>
<P>
   _Because NFL and major colleges are locked into rights fees from
the most established networks, game coverage would likely be
limited to anything below NCAA Division I, but not excluding
semipro, high school and youth leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Turner wouldn't mind sponsoring the first-ever national high
school championship, and a ``Little Bowl,'' which would be the Pop
Warner equivalent to the Little League World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Tape-delayed games and classic NFL and college games are also
being sought through the teams and schools (such as UCLA and USC).
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean a school such as Cal State Northridge, currently
locked into a Big Sky contract with Fox Sports Northwest, could see
some air time?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the kind of games we want,'' said Turner.
</P>
<P>
   _News shows, not unlike what ESPN has produced as ancillary
programming to its NFL and college game shows, for all levels.
</P>
<P>
   _Events such as Notre Dame's weekly press conference, NFL owners
meetings and awards banquets.
</P>
<P>
   _Unique shows, such as former player profiles, instructional
video and lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   _Movies. How many times can you watch ``Brian's Song''?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much to go around,'' Turner said. ``And we're not
even in competition with the networks for these things. We want to
be known as a complement.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's to keep this niche channel from being scratched before
it can deliver?
</P>
<P>
   If enthusiasm was all it took to get started, Turner, a former
backup quarterback on his high school team, would have been calling
signals the Saturday a few years ago when he turned on his TV set
to watch NFL highlights and was stuck with some three-minute clips
that left him completely unsatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   If molding a dream is all it takes to keep one motivated, the
economics major from the University of Virginia says he's
well-versed in ``the distribution of scarce resources for the
maximum benefit of all.'' Meaning Turner shouldn't have a problem
turning this into something very tangible.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   -- Why was Keith Olbermann touring the Fox Sports Net studios in
Century City earlier this week? Is he already beyond miserable with
his career in purgatory at MSNBC, even though it gets him an
occasional appearance on NBC's occasional baseball coverage? Will
the former KTLA and KCBS sportscaster who evolved into an ESPN
``SportsCenter'' icon consider a return to L.A.? Is Fox willing to
forgive him for snippy comments he made recently about Fox's News
Channel? Where's the list of potential designated drivers?
</P>
<P>
   -- Another chance for Marv Albert. He knows he's been a bad boy.
He's been spanked enough. Madison Square Garden Network was right
to take him back, but apparently it has to deal with another small
controversy. Reports are that several New York restaurants, upset
with Albert's return, will continue to post signs in their windows
stating ``No MSG.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   -- If you must call it a ``major victory'' for Fox that Disney
has to take down the ESPN West from the right-field wall at Edison
Field, so be it. But that's like saying the U.S. won a war against
Canada because the Canadians finally accepted that it couldn't
persuade Montana to become a new province. In today's messy cable
geography, ESPN West was a nice idea but two years too late. No one
really wins in this situation because viewers are stuck in a cable
world of, believe it or not, restriction. Can't we all just all get
along now?
</P>
<P>
   -- There he is, Mr. Football Guy. We see now why ABC's newest
``Monday Night Football'' analyst, Boomer Esiason, was such a find.
The network already has him crossing over to audibilize as co-host
of the Miss America Pageant on Sept. 19. In recent years, we hear
the pageant had considered he-man Frank Gifford as co-host, but
they could never get a commitment once the optional swimsuit
competition ruling went into effect.

APPEALS COURT REJECTS EFFORT TO KEEP SECRET SERVICE OFFICIALS FROM
TESTIFYING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 3rd-5th grafs for clarifications)  (With CLINTON-STARR-TEXT) 
(sw) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Acting with unusual speed, nine judges on the
federal appeals court here unanimously rejected a last-minute
request by the Clinton administration to block the testimony of
Secret Service officials, including the head of President Clinton's
protective detail, in the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department immediately responded with an emergency
petition forwarded to Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the
Supreme Court. The sealed petition asks Rehnquist, who is in Europe
while the court is in recess, to delay any testimony by Secret
Service officials until the full court can consider the
administration's appeal, lawyers involved in the case said.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief order on Thursday, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia declined the administration's request
to have the full bench reconsider the argument for a novel
privilege that would shield Secret Service officials from having to
testify. A three-judge panel of the appeals court had sided with
the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, on the issue just last
week. The administration's move was seen as a desperate gambit,
particularly because the full court does not often grant such
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   And a terse order issued earlier on Thursday by three of the
nine appeals judges once again signaled that the administration
faced long odds. ``We also believe, for the reasons stated in our
opinion of July 7, 1998, that the Justice Department's likelihood
of success before the Supreme Court is insufficient to warrant
further delay in the grand jury's investigation,'' said the three
judges, who first heard the appeal last month.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, had sought the testimony of a few uniformed Secret
Service officers for several months. After court decisions were
issued in his favor, including the appellate ruling last week by
the three-judge panel involved in Thursday's action, Starr cast a
wider net this week. He subpoenaed the agents closest to President
Clinton, setting off a firestorm of criticism by administration
officials and laying the groundwork for a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was punctuated by a flurry of legal briefs and
rapid-fire court rulings that started early on as seven Secret
Service officials under subpoena prepared to enter the grand jury
room on Thursday morning. Their testimony was temporarily put off
at the last minute so that appeals could be pursued.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, administration officials began bracing
for the possibility that some of the agents may have to appear as
early as next week when the grand jury resumes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the agents subpoenaed this week was Larry Cockell, the
head of Clinton's detail who spends more time with the president
than any other Government employee. Anticipating that Cockell, an
18-year-veteran of the Secret Service, may soon have to spend
considerable time being questioned, the agency on Thursday
temporarily reassigned him to a less demanding job. Officials said
it would be impossible for him to be at the president's side in
Washington and on the road if he must also spend time as a grand
jury witness.
</P>
<P>
   While the decision on Thursday moves the Secret Service
officials one step closer to testifying before the grand jury, it
also foreshadows future court disputes between the independent
counsel and the president.
</P>
<P>
   The president's private lawyers have expressed concern that
investigators may ask Secret Service agents what they may have
overheard of conversations between Clinton and his lawyers. Such
questions would be all but certain to prompt a new round of legal
wrangling over the parameters of the lawyer-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The blanket rejection of the administration's appeal came
remarkably quick, just two days after Attorney General Janet Reno
pleaded for the judges to intervene and avert what she said ``is
likely to result in a national tragedy.'' The Secret Service has
been maintained that if agents are forced to testify, they will no
longer be able to protect the president adequately because he could
be inclined to push them away.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had also prepared for an eventual missive
to the Supreme Court, by lodging its emergency petition early on
Wednesday night with the clerk of the court. And it moved on
Thursday have the papers put in Rehnquist's hands. The appellate
court gave the Secret Service until Friday at noon to seek a stay
from Rehnquist. But the order by the three appeals court judges
reduced the chances that the chief justice would intervene.
</P>
<P>
   They found that the Justice Department had failed to show a stay
was necessary to avert an ``irreparable harm.'' Supreme Court
practice requires Rehnquist to make such a finding before issuing
any stays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Justice has not made a sufficient showing
that irreparable harm will result unless a stay and an order are
issued, and it has not made a sufficient showing that it will
ultimately prevail in establishing the privilege it alleges,''
wrote the three judges, Douglas Ginsburg, A. Raymond Randolph, and
Stephen Williams. ``The privilege is said to be necessary because,
without it, the President will distance himself from Secret Service
agents charged with the duty of protecting him.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The harm asserted is future harm, depending on a prediction
about what the President will do in the absence of the privilege.
This court has ruled that the privilege does not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If harm of the sort the Department envisions is now occurring,
it therefore must be because the President does not believe the
Supreme Court will sustain the privilege,'' the order said.
``Neither a stay nor an order under the All Writs Act can alter or
prevent that alleged harm. Testimony today by Secret Service agents
regarding past events cannot change our ruling. And such testimony
cannot affect how the Supreme Court will rule.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's assertion of a special privilege for the
agents has been rejected by every judge who has considered it. Even
several of the president's advisers predicted that in light of
Thursday's decisions, it would be unlikely that Rehnquist would
issue a stay. The Supreme Court does not begin hearing cases until
it returns in October.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   White House officials, who have said that Clinton has not been
involved in the Secret Service appeal, declined to comment on
Thursday's ruling. But they took issue with a concurring opinion to
the full court's ruling rejecting the administration's request for
review.
</P>
<P>
   In the concurring opinion, Judge Laurence Silberman wrote that
the attorney general was ``acting as the President's counsel under
the false guise of representing the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am mindful of the terrible political pressures and strains
of conscience that bear upon senior political appointees of the
Justice Department when an Independent Counsel (or special
prosecutor) is investigating the President of the United States,''
Silberman wrote. ``Those strains are surely exacerbated when the
President's agents literally and figuratively `declare war' on the
Independent Counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge's comments were disputed by Charles Ruff, the counsel
to the President.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we have stated before, the attorney general and the
secretary of the Treasury have made their decisions on how to
proceed in this matter with complete independence, guided by the
advice of career law enforcement professionals,'' Ruff said. ``They
have had only one interest _ to ensure that the Secret Service is
able to perform its vitally important duties. Any suggestion to the
contrary is without foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Secret Service officials received a reprieve from
having to appear the grand jury, the jurors continued their work on
Thursday by hearing from Linda Tripp for the sixth time. It was
Mrs. Tripp who began the Lewinsky inquiry when she called the
independent counsel's office last January and said she had secretly
recorded conversations with, Ms. Lewinsky, her former Pentagon
colleague, that suggested an unlawful coverup.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp is scheduled to return to the grand jury when it
resumes its deliberations next Tuesday.

ENRON BUYS STAKE IN FAST-GROWING BRAZILIAN POWER DISTRIBUTOR  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KAREN SANTOS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Enron Corp. announced Thursday that it has agreed to
pay about $1.3 billion for a large stake in one of Brazil's
fastest-growing electricity distributors to expand its presence in
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Enron is buying a controlling interest in state-owned &UR;  &LR; Elektro
Eletricidade e Servicos SA, which distributes electricity in Sao
Paulo, the company said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price is nearly double the $640 million price tag
set as the minimum by the Brazilian government and 30 percent
higher than analysts' expectations, according to Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   Enron beat out four other bidders also vying for ownership of
Elektro. The second-highest bidder, Eletricidade de Portugal SA,
offered 1.2 billion reais, or $1.03 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to become the first international natural gas and
electric utility,'' said David Garcia, an energy industry analyst
with Everen Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Enron has several other ventures in South America, including a
share in a natural gas pipeline that runs from Bolivia to Brazil.
It also has other stakes in energy companies and thermoelectric
plants in seven Brazilian states as well as four other Latin
American countries, including Argentina and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime ... a company is protected from competition, it
becomes fat and sloppy,'' Garcia said, referring to the  &UR;  &LR; state-run
electric company. ``There's a lot of fat and slop that can be
eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said that the company will have to provide better service
than its predecessor to earn the trust of locals. He said several
places in Sao Paulo suffer from occasional problems such as
shortages and worn transformers. He also said that much of the
underground wiring system needs repair after years of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has ``a stable and robust economy _ there's a demand for
energy,'' said Steve Schuler, president of Houston Brazil, which is
the business development division of Houston Industries in Brazil.
Houston Industries is part owner of Light Servicos de Eletricidade
SA, an electric utility in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Industries faced the challenge of transforming the
dismal performance of Light, which had a reputation for poor
service and blackouts, according to a Wall Street Journal article
published in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we had an extremely hot summer,'' in Rio, Schuler
said. ``There was residential growth in the summer months of 22
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Light faced an unusually high load in the face of
searing temperatures and an flood of new residents. Light's new
system was upgraded and should be able to handle the upcoming
summer, Schuler said.
</P>
<P>
   Enron's purchase of Elektro will probably spark the interest of
other foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   While the privatization movement in Latin America may attract
foreign ventures, ``there are only a few companies with
international expertise,'' and will perform well, said Carol Coale,
an analyst at Prudential Securities. Enron may pursue some water
ventures as well as explore possibilities for renewable energy
sources, Coale said.
</P>
<P>
   Enron's stock closed at 57 3/4, up 1 11/16.

COKE'S EARNINGS DOWN; PEPSI REPORTS EARLY WITH GAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Co. reported a decline in earnings for the second
quarter Thursday and, in a burst of corporate competitiveness,
Pepsico said its earnings rose.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico had not been scheduled to report its financial results
until next Tuesday. But a spokesman for the company said the
decision was made to move up the announcement because Wall Street
had pushed down the price of its shares about 8 percent this week,
reacting to a report that sales at the company's Frito-Lay division
in a recent four-week period were less than stellar. Pepsi shares
closed Thursday at $37.9375, down 18.75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was an overreaction, but because of the pending
earnings announcement, we couldn't comment,'' the spokesman,
Richard Detwiler, said, citing a ``quiet period'' of five working
days before earnings reports required by the Securities and
Exchange Commission. ``So we moved to release our earnings early.
We wanted to provide more data on our performance than was sitting
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi's earnings for the quarter, before one-time accounting
adjustments last year, rose 19 percent, to $494 million, or 33
cents a diluted share, on revenue of $5.26 billion, compared with
earnings of $414 million, or 26 cents a share, on revenue of $5.09
billion a year earlier. The results matched expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Volume increased in both snacks and beverages, but worldwide
beverage operating profit fell because of increased spending by the
North American beverage division, all part of a strategy to
increase Pepsi's market share. ``They are tired of seeing their
stock dumped on unjustifiably,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a beverage
analyst with Paine Webber. ``No one's been looking beyond their
nose, but I think they are positioned for a very nice second
half.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke reported a 9 percent decline in second-quarter earnings on
a slight increase in revenue, reflecting the effect of the strong
dollar on the overseas business of the company, the world's leading
soft-drink maker.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar's higher exchange value meant that Coke's profits in
many foreign currencies translated into fewer dollars.
International companies like Coca-Cola can be vulnerable to such
currency fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ending on June 30, Coca-Cola, which is based in
Atlanta, earned $1.19 billion, or 48 cents a diluted share, on
revenue of $5.15 billion. That compared with earnings of $1.31
billion, or 52 cents a diluted share, on revenue of $5.07 billion
in the second quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings results were slightly above Wall Street
expectations of 47 cents a share, but Coke's stock fell 62.5 cents,
to $87.185. On Tuesday, the stock closed at a 52-week high of
$88.9375.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the currency problems had been anticipated, and analysts
generally saw good news in the earnings report, based on a 10
percent increase in worldwide case volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had spectacular volume growth worldwide and in North
America,'' said Andrew Conway, a beverage analyst with Morgan
Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   In North America, Coke's sales rose 8 percent overall and 8
percent in the United States, which is about 1.5 times the rate of
the soft-drink industry as a whole in the United States, Conway
said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's chairman and chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester,
attributed the sales growth to ``solid increases in the company's
core brands,'' like Coca-Cola, Diet Coke and Sprite.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest percentage sales increase was in Africa, at 18
percent. Sales in Latin America grew 12 percent, and in Europe by
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, part of the company's Middle and Far East Group, sales
appeared strong in some places despite economic travails in the
region. Unit case volume grew 28 percent in China and 33 percent in
India. Sales in Japan fell 3 percent, which the company attributed
partly to a retail price increase, the first in seven years, though
analysts said the overall state of the Japanese economy played a
major role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our performance across Asia is the result of our ability to
stay focused and adjust in these tough times,'' Ivester said.
Analysts had questioned company executives at a meeting last month
about Japan, and had been told there was ``no growth'' there, but
were given no details.

LOCKHEED MARTIN SCRAPS MERGER WITH NORTHROP GRUMMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Ron Hutcheson 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lockheed Martin scrapped its planned merger with
Northrop Grumman on Thursday because of government opposition,
pulling the plug on a $11.7 billion deal that would have created an
aerospace powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The decision could have far-reaching future implications.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies had viewed the corporate marriage as an ideal
opportunity to adapt to the post-Cold War era and other changes in
the defense industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been good for the American taxpayers, national
security and Texas jobs,'' said a disappointed Rep. Kay Granger,
R-Fort Worth. Lockheed Martin employs nearly 20,000 people in North
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials called the decision a victory for
taxpayers. The Justice Department filed suit to block the proposed
merger in March, arguing that the combined company would have a
virtual monopoly, especially in certain areas of defense
electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin's products include the Fort Worth-built F-16
fighter and the F-22 stealth fighter. It is also bidding to build
the planned Joint Strike Fighter, the next-generation plane that
would ensure the future of the Fort Worth plant well into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   Northrop Grumman makes the B-2 Stealth bomber and is one of the
biggest sucontractors for Boeing's commercial aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general for antitrust issues,
said his department welcomed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means the U.S. government and the American people will
continue to receive the highest possible quality of military
products in defense of this nation, at the lowest cost to the
American taxpayer,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed shelved the deal after attempts to negotiate a
settlement broke down. The case had been scheduled to go to court
Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our inability to reach an acceptable solution, combined with
our concern over the litigation with our principal customer,
necessitates this decision,'' said Vance Coffman, Lockheed's
chairman. ``Continuing the litigation at this point is simply not
in the best interests of Lockheed Martin's customers, shareholders
or employees.''

DESPITE NEWSPAPER'S APOLOGY, CHIQUITA STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to add when Chiquita executives were
interviewed. ) (With sidebar, CHIQUITA-MEDIA) 
(nk) 
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Overlooked in the furor that followed when The
Cincinnati Enquirer last month apologized for a stinging series
accusing Chiquita Brands International of engaging in corruption
were the extraordinary allegations at the heart of the series _ the
questionable business practices of a major corporation with broad
influence in the United States and across Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in their first lengthy interviews on the subject, top
Chiquita executives claimed total victory and portrayed the entire
package of articles as unfair and inaccurate, the untrustworthy
work of a reporter who stole hundreds of voice-mail messages. But
interviews with government officials, people outside the company,
and some of those quoted, along with a review of the articles,
found that some of the allegations cannot be dismissed so easily,
despite the questions raised about the methods used to report them.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission had already initiated an
inquiry into Chiquita's practices on the basis of some of the
stolen taped voice-mail messages, and the government of Honduras,
where Chiquita has been a power for decades, said it was reviewing
some of the charges raised by the series, ranging from bribery of
foreign officials to the use of dangerous pesticides at some of the
company's foreign agricultural sites.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita could face penalties under the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act if it engaged in or failed to disclose bribery. A
lawyer briefed on the commission's inquiries to the company said
the investigation was not slowed by the disclosure that the voice
mail was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just draw your attention to the fact that the information
that was reported was extremely detailed,'' said the lawyer, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``This isn't going away.''
</P>
<P>
   Determining the validity of the newspaper's claims is difficult.
The publisher and editor of the newspaper, which paid more than $10
million to Chiquita, refused to discuss the articles or provide
access to the voice-mail messages and Chiquita records, citing a
confidentiality agreement with Chiquita. Mike Gallagher, the
reporter who wrote the articles, did not respond to messages left
at his home, and his attorney, Patrick Hanley, did not return
telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   However, no one has disputed the authenticity of the voice mail
and internal Chiquita records that formed the basis for the most
sensational allegations, and the Chiquita executives said they
could not respond to some questions raised by the articles.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita has a storied and infamous past. Its predecessor
company, United Fruit, was so influential in Latin America, where
most bananas are grown, that it inspired the term ``banana
republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl H. Lindner Jr., a prominent Cincinnati financier and major
donor to the Republicans and Democrats, acquired a majority
interest in Chiquita in 1984 through his American Financial Corp.
Four years later, he moved Chiquita to Cincinnati from New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Chiquita has worked to shake off its old
notoriety and present itself as a socially and environmentally
conscious company. But trade restrictions and new competitors have
made selling bananas a tough business, and company executives
acknowledged that they can make improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have work to do,'' said Steven Warshaw, Chiquita
president and chief operating officer. ``The company is making a
tremendous effort to do things right, but that doesn't happen
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Enquirer offered a sharp rebuttal to the new image in an
18-page special section published May 3, called ``Chiquita Secrets
Revealed.'' The articles claimed the company secretly controlled
dozens of supposedly independent banana companies to avoid
restrictions on land ownership and limit unions, threatened the
health of its workers through indiscriminate use of pesticides and
was involved in a bribery scheme and a host of other questionable
practices.
</P>
<P>
   But on June 28, The Enquirer, owned by the Gannett Co.,
published its apology to Chiquita. The paper said Gallagher had
claimed to have obtained copies of the voice-mail messages from a
high-ranking Chiquita official. ``The Enquirer has now become
convinced that the above representations, accusations and
conclusions are untrue and created a false and misleading
impression of Chiquita's business practices,'' read the apology.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Olson, Chiquita's general counsel, said the company had
prepared a suit against The Enquirer and that the paper avoided it
only at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Enquirer publisher, Harry Whipple, and editor, Lawrence
Beaupre, declined to answer any questions about the accuracy and
fairness of the stories or the circumstances surrounding the
apology. Whipple said they were bound by a confidentiality
agreement with Chiquita.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chiquita executives, Warshaw and Olson, provided a
rebuttal to some of the allegations in a two-hour interview,
several follow-up conversations and written material. They
declined, however, to answer questions on some key points, citing
the Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry and an ongoing
criminal investigation into the theft of the voice-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   The executives did not dispute the authenticity of the voice
mail or internal documents. However, they said the paper's articles
took brief portions out of context and provided an unfair and
inaccurate portrait of Chiquita.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We all know that voice-mail messages are often thoughts in
process or, in my vernacular, blah, blah, blah,'' said Warshaw,
whose own voice mail was invaded. ``They represent conjecture and
cannot be understood out of context.''
</P>
<P>
   But the articles were based on more than voice-mail messages.
Indeed, the article charging that the company used foreign trusts
to evade restrictions on land ownership in Honduras, a major
growing location, relied on Chiquita documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using more than one bank in Honduras and more than one country
to establish offshore trusts further obfuscates the ownership of
the farms,'' said a 1991 letter from a Chiquita finance executive
to a company vice president, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
   A voice-mail message played a key role in describing what the
newspaper said was the company's secret ownership of a farm
management company in Guatemala called COBIGUA. After Enquirer
reporters questioned company lawyers about rumors concerning
Chiquita ownership of COBIGUA last October, David Hills, a Chiquita
lawyer, left a message for one of his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is to answer that, first of all, that COBIGUA is
not our subsidiary, it's just one of our (independent) associate
producers _ wink, wink _ because we have to take that position
publicly,'' said Hills, according to the article. ``We cannot
possibly admit that COBIGUA is our subsidiary.''
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw said he could not respond directly to questions about
the trusts and relations with banana producers for competitive
reasons. ``My blanket statement is that we operate an international
business in a manner that we and others consider to be ethical,''
he said. ``We are highly confident that any arrangements that have
been put into place are conforming.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the articles ran, The Enquirer provided information about
the trust arrangements to the Honduran embassy in Washington, D.C.
An embassy official, Benjamin Zapata, was quoted saying the
government would review the matter.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Honduran ambassador to the United States, Edgardo
Dumas Rodriguez, said in an interview Wednesday that there would be
no inquiry. ``Do you believe that the government of Honduras should
trust someone who did what this reporter did?'' asked the
ambassador. ``We have no reasonable reason to believe Chiquita did
these things.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Honduras, where Chiquita has been a powerful political force
for nearly a century, the controversy has had surprisingly little
impact. The Enquirer's initial stories were widely reproduced, but
merely reinforced the low regard in which many Hondurans
traditionally have held the company, journalists and diplomats
said. The newspaper's apology and $10 million payment was
overshadowed by other news.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell the truth, not that many people have been paying
attention, because the flap occurred right in the middle of the
World Cup, and most people were more interested in soccer,'' said
Juan Bautista Vazquez, a veteran radio reporter in Tegucigalpa, the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the company said the memos and voice mail
messages provided dramatic confirmation of long-held suspicions
about Chiquita's operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the sudden the voice mail and documents confirmed all
the things we have believed passionately,'' said Larry Birns, an
official at the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a liberal research
organization in Washington. ``Chiquita got the luckiest break in
the world when the messages turned out to be stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   Birns said he provided Gallagher documents from the council's
files and the reporter allowed him to record some voice mail
messages. Last month, he said, an FBI agent came to his office and
asked for copies of any Chiquita tapes in his possession.
</P>
<P>
   The articles also claimed that Chiquita's use of pesticides
endangers workers and residents near its farms, despite an
agreement with an independent environmental group to follow strict
standards. In addition to voice mail messages and internal
documents, those articles relied on many interviews in Central
America and additional records, including a coroner's report on the
death of one worker from exposure to toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw disputed the claims, saying the company is a model in
its attempts to reduce the use of pesticides and that government
agencies in Central America have approved its practices.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita executives said they were particularly angered that the
newspaper implied that toxic pesticides were sprayed on workers
from airplanes. They said the company does not engage in aerial
spraying of pesticides, although it does so with herbicides, which
are far less dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most controversial articles claimed Chiquita tried to
cover up a bribery scheme in Colombia that implicated employees of
a chemical company and its subsidiaries. The article, which relied
heavily on voice mail messages, described apparent payments to
customs agents for use of a storage facility. In one message to
Warshaw and Olson, a Chiquita lawyer discussed how to fire one of
the employees without implicating the company.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately three employees, including an executive in Cincinnati
and one in Colombia, were forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita also offered defenses from third parties in the
interview, including a recent United Nations report that singled
out one of Chiquita's banana farms for its efforts to reduce
pollution and copies of letters to The Enquirer objecting to
portions of the articles.
</P>
<P>
   Olson said the article had many facts wrong, but he refused to
discuss specifics because of the Securities and Exchange Commission
investigation. ``Management covered all the right bases on this and
behaved properly,'' said Olson.

   HELENDALE, Calif. _ In her world and time, Dixie Evans was a
star.
</P>
<P>
   From Los Angeles to New York, she was billed as the Marilyn
Monroe of Burlesque. And much like the screen goddess, Miss Evans
was sultry, smart and blond and knew how to capture a man's
attention with the wag of a finger.
</P>
<P>
   Those days for Miss Evans and burlesque are long gone. But she
still has her memories, and she shares them with anyone who walks
through her wrought-iron gate just outside of this small patch of
desert, a two-hour drive east of Los Angeles and 17 miles off the
road to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Evans is tour guide, curator, president and keeper of the
flame (and of the fans) at Exotic World, a museum and hall of fame
dedicated to the history of burlesque and stripper stars from the
'20s to the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people deserve their place in entertainment history,''
Miss Evans said the other day as she danced her fingers through her
hair, still blond at the age of 72. ``But I don't have the space or
the mannequins to give the era the credit it's due.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum is in a one-story building that used to be a series
of goat sheds on what used to be a 40-acre goat farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one old goat left,'' Miss Evans said, ``and
that's me.''
</P>
<P>
   Exotic World is packed with sequined gowns, glittering shoes,
flowing boas and skimpy bras worn and discarded by such stars as
Tempest Storm, Sally Rand, who made the fan dance famous, and
Jennie Lee the Bazoom Girl, who founded the museum and died of
cancer in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every inch of wall space is covered with posters and
photographs of those women and scores of others with stage names
like the Alaska Heat Wave and Gail Winds, the Texas Twister.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good name helped put people in the seats,'' Miss Evans said.
``That's show biz.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Evans clothed the mannequins with donations from the
closets and drawers of former colleagues. In her will, Sheri
Champagne, a dancer, left her costumes and her ashes to Exotic
World. She died several years ago, and her urn sits on a shelf in
the museum under a picture of Miss Champagne in her glory days.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Evans said about 40 people a week stop by the museum for a
35-minute tour. Many of the visitors are Europeans going to Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is mentioned in several guide books, and Miss Evans
said she had appeared in nearly 60 news programs, mostly in Europe,
where ``they are just fascinated.''
</P>
<P>
   Exotic World is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., but Miss Evans, who
lives on the property with several people, dogs, cats and a horse,
will open the museum at almost any hour if someone drops by.
</P>
<P>
   There is no charge, and most people leave a donation, from 50
cents to $100, as did a gray-haired man once, who said the museum
brought back a lot of good memories for him.
</P>
<P>
   For Miss Evans, burlesque is a proud piece of show business
history, especially during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a marvelous institution for the American public during
the Depression when people had nothing to look forward to,'' she
said. ``For 25 cents, you could see a cast of 60 and forget your
worries for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Exotic dancers, Miss Evans said, were only one part of the
burlesque shows, which also included comedians, musicians and other
acts.
</P>
<P>
   As she walked through the museum the other day, ``Harlem
Nocturne'' played softly in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't fight over men or money,'' she said of her
colleagues. ``We fought over that song. Everyone wanted to dance to
`Harlem Nocturne.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During the tour, Miss Evans slipped in and out of a very good
impersonation of Marilyn Monroe's voice and famous poses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you couldn't meet the real Marilyn,'' she, ``you could come
to the burlesque and meet me.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Evans said that she began imitating Monroe in 1951 and that
in 1957 her lawyers threatened to sue but never followed through.
Five years later, Monroe was dead, and Miss Evans said her own
career nearly ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt terrible,'' she said. ``I decided to rely on myself. I
dyed my hair black, and I flopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year, she puts on the Miss Exotic World pageant, a
combination talent show and reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our Olympics,'' she proclaims on the museum's Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Young dancers from as far as Chicago come to the desert to
compete for the title and old dancers come to remember the past and
to share war stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not try to encourage any girl to go into dancing,'' Miss
Evans said. ``It's not for everybody. But for me, it was wonderful.
I had a great time.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that signals the end of major mergers in the nation's
military industry, Lockheed Martin Corp. abandoned its planned $8.3
billion acquisition of the Northrop Grumman Corp. on Thursday, a
deal that the government opposed on antitrust grounds.
</P>
<P>
   After months of negotiations between the companies and the
government to avoid a court fight over the transaction, Lockheed
said Thursday that efforts to reach a pretrial settlement with its
biggest customer were ``not successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lockheed board voted Thursday afternoon to end a takeover
that would have created the nation's largest military supplier,
nearly a third larger than its nearest competitor, Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which shareholders of both companies had already
approved, was the biggest corporate merger ever dismantled because
of government opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, nearly eight months after the deal was announced,
the Justice Department, supported by the Defense Department, sued
to block the acquisition, contending that a combination of the
companies threatened the nation's defense by limiting competition.
This action represented an about-face for the Defense Department,
which had long encouraged a wave of mergers that swept through the
military industry since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our inability to reach an acceptable solution, combined with
our concern over the litigation with our principal customer,
necessitates this decision,'' said Lockheed chairman and chief
executive Vance Coffman. ``Continuing the litigation at this point
is simply not in the best interests of Lockheed Martin's customers,
shareholders or employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed, which has grown through the acquisition of 22
different military contractors to become the nation's No. 2
military supplier, is best known as the maker of the F-16 fighter
jet and many missile systems. Northrop, which makes components for
the B-2 bomber, is the nation's No. 3 supplier.
</P>
<P>
   The government feared that a union of the two would create an
unacceptable level of ``vertical integration'' in which Lockheed
could control too much of Northrop's electronics business in ways
that could suppress competition and drive up prices.
</P>
<P>
   Northrop chairman and chief executive Kent Kresa said Thursday
that ``while we believed the merger was in the best interests of
our constituencies, Northrop Grumman can and will continue as a
strong, independent competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Kresa may have difficulty convincing shareholders
of that. He had said Northrop might not survive without the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Although the termination of the deal was announced after the
stock market closed Thursday, Northrop's shares dropped $5.6875, or
5.5 percent, to $97.375, on reports that negotiations had failed.
Shares of Lockheed Martin fell 56.25 cents, to $103.9375. Northrop
stock had reached a 52-week high of $139 on Feb. 27, the day after
Lockheed Martin and Northrop shareholders approved the combination.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the deal may indicate that the Pentagon, which
since 1993 has supported a consolidation of the nation's military
industry, has altered its policy. There are, in fact, no larger
companies left to merge. Between 1992 and 1997, $55 billion worth
of mergers took place in the military industry. Lockheed gobbled up
companies such as Martin Marietta, Loral and Unisys Defense. Boeing
acquired McDonnell Douglas and Rockwell Defense. In fact, three
companies _ Lockheed, Boeing and Raytheon _ were called, in
industry jargon, the ``megadominant'' players.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Pentagon had no comment Thursday on the cancellation of the
deal. Joel Klein, head of the Justice Department's antitrust
division, praised Lockheed's decision. ``This means that the U.S.
government and the American people will continue to receive the
highest possible quality of military products and services,'' Klein
said.
</P>
<P>
   Loren Thompson, a defense industry analyst at the Lexington
Institute, a Washington research organization, said Lockheed's
decision ``clearly indicates that there is a sea change in the
Pentagon's approach to industry consolidation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The big deals are over'' he said. ``We are at the end of the
wave of defense industry mega-mergers.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lockheed, there was little concern among analysts over its
future. Thompson, for instance, said that the termination of this
deal ``is nothing more than a speed bump'' for Lockheed.
</P>
<P>
   With more than $28 billion in sales and a variety of businesses
that include not only military products but also operations such as
satellites, electronics and telecommunications, Lockheed is well
positioned in an array of industries and not dependent on the
Northrop deal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the deal was important enough for Lockheed to have even
offered to shed the crown jewel of the deal, Northrop's electronics
business, to gain government approval. The government rejected this
offer, and settlement talks broke down over the last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last three or four months, we've been in the process
of trying to find a solution to get this resolved,'' Coffman,
Lockheed's chief executive, said in an interview. ``More than a
dozen different solutions were examined. We discussed them with the
government and, at the end of the day, none of them were
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it was time for us to say that we will withdraw from this
deal because the tension was rising with our biggest customer,''
Coffman said, referring to the Pentagon. He said that within the
last month, ``I had rising hope we might find a path.''
</P>
<P>
   The change in Defense Department policy may also reflect a
change in key individuals at the Justice Department and at the
Pentagon from the time Lockheed and Northrop first announced the
deal. Klein took over as antitrust chief at the Justice Department,
and drew a harder line on proposed mergers, while the Pentagon
received a new head of acquisition policy, Jacques Gansler, who was
more critical than his predecessor of military industry mergers.
</P>
<P>
   For Northrop, the outlook is less certain. It is best known as
the maker of electronic components for the B-2 bomber, and a union
with Lockheed would have put it in a position to have a steady
customer for the components in Lockheed's fighter planes. Instead,
Northrop is seen as lacking the heft to compete with other
electronic giants like Raytheon but is too large to be a niche
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for Northrop right now is to assure the troops,'' said
Jon B. Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners, which
specializes in the military industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might adopt a go-it-alone strategy, or they might make
some smaller acquisitions themselves. There's also been a lot of
speculation that they might join with a foreign partner, but I'm
not sure they want to test the edges of the envelope again with
that kind of a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   One person close to the Pentagon, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that there was ``some ambivalence'' within the
Defense Department about breaking up the deal _ fears that Northrop
might be acquired by a British company, most likely General
Electric Co. PLC. ``That made people queasy,'' this person said.

CELEBRATION OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS MOVEMENTS DRAWS THOUSANDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind.)   (js)  
 By JANE GROSS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SENECA FALLS, N.Y. _ Rachel Waite honored her foremothers on
Thursday, during the 150th anniversary of the first U.S. women's
rights convention, by doubling the prices at her curb-side lemonade
stand.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel easily fetched 50 cents a cup from the stream of tourists
on hand for the festivities, which brought the first lady, the
governor of New York, the secretary of state and the officers of
the National Organization for Women to this tiny Finger Lakes
village, which lives and breathes its unusual history year in and
year out.
</P>
<P>
   Waite's stand was directly across the street from the house
where Elizabeth Cady Stanton started the feminist movement. The
10-year-old was hazy on the details _ she mistakenly thought Mrs.
Stanton was the first woman to cast a vote. But the girl was true
to the mission of the Quaker housewives who made history here in
1848 with their demands for equality.
</P>
<P>
   Waite was clearly the boss at the lemonade stand, giving orders
to her little brother. And in making her own decision on how her
profits would be used _ for a trip to a nearby water park and a
college fund _ she realized her life was vastly different from Mrs.
Stanton's.
</P>
<P>
   ``She couldn't be what she wanted to be, like us,'' Waite said.
</P>
<P>
   The blend of commerce and history at Waite's lemonade stand
reflected the tone for the celebrations here, as if Masterpiece
Theater were interrupted for commercials. The events in recent days
included re-enactments of the convention, concerts by women
performers, extra tours at the museums and plenty of goodies to eat
and souvenirs to buy.
</P>
<P>
   On the road to town, signs outside Polar Freeze, Wal-Mart and
Bill Trout's Lincoln/Mercury showroom welcomed visitors to the
celebration. Along Fall Street, stores were hung with bright
bunting and decked with flowers. Hawkers sold mugs, tie tacks and
tea towels emblazoned with the face of plump, frizzy-haired Mrs.
Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   But at various public events, impassioned applause punctuated
the reading of the Declaration of Sentiments, the manifesto that
itemized the ``injuries and usurptations'' by men against women and
called for new civil and social rights _ to vote, own property,
divorce abusive husbands and claim educational and employment
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must finish the work that was done here,'' said the first
lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who today addressed a sweltering
crowd estimated at 10,000 at the high school football field. This
was the last stop on Mrs. Clinton's tour of historical monuments in
need of restoration, which include the M'Clintock House in
neighboring Waterloo, where Mrs. Stanton and four friends drafted
their declaration at the mahogany dining room table. Mrs. Clinton
has pledged to raise $1 million in private contributions to restore
the M'Clintock House.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's visit to the M'Clintock House on Wednesday
evening drew crowds three deep along the nearby streets as the
First Lady waved from the front of her bus. On one front porch,
Kerri Brown and Jeff Hauke argued about which of them she was
greeting. Ms. Brown won the argument. Hauke popped another beer.
</P>
<P>
   The five housewives who convened at the M'Clintock House 150
years ago were driven there by the claustrophobia of their own
lives. Mrs. Stanton, for one, complained of her ``mental hunger,''
stuck at home with seven children while her abolitionist husband
traveled the country.
</P>
<P>
   She was 32 and well educated, and had been raised by a doting
father who encouraged her interest in his legal career. But now she
found herself far from the stimulation of Boston, struggling to
make a life for herself in a modest clapboard house here, just
upwind from the 115 factories that were creating prosperity at the
same time they were cutting women off from the shared work of
farming and isolating them at home.
</P>
<P>
   Western New York was America's frontier then, a hotbed of social
ferment. The region was home to reformers, religionists and
abolitionists. These were activities women could join and on which
they could cut their teeth for the awakening movement for equal
rights, which would be led by Mrs. Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   That movement, born here with the 1848 convention at Wesleyan
Methodist Chapel, is commemorated with a national park that
includes the remnants of the chapel, the homes of Mrs. Stanton and
Mary Ann M'Clintock, an interpretive center with educational
exhibits and a waterfall that streams over a bluestone carving of
the Declaration of Sentiments. Also located here is the national
Women's Hall of Fame, where 21 new members were inducted this week,
including Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many upstate towns that boomed at the turn of the century
and then fell on hard times, Seneca Falls remains a
prosperous-looking place. An active historical preservation
committee has seen to it that the streets are still lined with the
ample Victorian and Gothic Revival homes once owned by the
19th-century industrialists.
</P>
<P>
   Some here attribute the village's enduring prosperity to the one
remaining factory from the heady years of the Industrial
Revolution, Goulds Pumps, recently bought by ITT Industries and a
major employer. Others cite the willingness of longtime Seneca
Falls loyalists to commute to jobs 90 minutes away in Rochester or
Syracuse. The population remains at 7,000, comparable to what it
was in the village's heyday at the time of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism would get a boost if the monuments to the women's
movement were to become more popular destinations. According to
Josie Fernandez, the new superintendent of the 18-year-old national
park here, average annual attendance is 35,000. Ms. Fernandez said
she anticipated that many visitors during this four-day celebration
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The women's monuments are a regular part of the education of
local schoolchildren, like 12-year-old Rebecca Ferguson-Knox, who
visited the Stanton House this week (and drank Rachel Waite's
lemonade) along with her parents, grandparents and brother. Rebecca
particularly enjoyed hearing that Mrs. Stanton taught her sons to
cook and knit and allowed her daughters to roughhouse in the yard,
unheard-of activities in the 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   At the Stanton House for the first time this week were a couple
from Terre Haute, Ind., Gary Daily and Susan Dehler, who boasted of
``15 years of unmarried bliss.'' Daily has taught women's history
since 1965 without ever seeing these sights. He marveled at the
explosion of interest in a field that had virtually no scholars or
teaching materials in the early days of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Education of a more informal kind was taking place outside a
news shop on Fall Street, where Carl Mele, the owner of C-J News &AMP;
Sundries, was grilling sausages for the tourists. One of them, in
town for Wednesday's NOW rally, had upbraided him for calling her a
``lady'' rather than a ``woman,'' Mele said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the difference now,'' he boasted, wiping grease from
his hands and sweat from his brow. ``If that's what their feelings
are, it's OK with me. I'm easy to get along with.'' But apparently
Mele's lesson in political correctness was brief. Today, his
transactions with female customers ended with a cheery, ``Thanks
honey.''

NEW YORK TIMES CO. POSTS 11.7 PERCENT DECLINE IN NET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York Times Co. reported an 11.7 percent decline
in net income Thursday for the second quarter but said that
earnings before special items and a one-time charge rose 16.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rising advertising revenues resulted in the increase in
operating earnings, the company said. The growth was partly offset,
however, by higher newsprint costs and greater depreciation expense
in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The second-quarter results met the expectations of Wall Street
analysts. But the company's stock fell $2.875 Thursday, or 7.3
percent, to $36.6875 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings for the quarter were reduced by 4 cents a share by a
one-time charge of $7.7 million related to the repurchase of $78.1
million in debt. The quarter also included gains from the 1997 sale
of tennis, sailing and ski magazines and from a tax adjustment. As
a result, net income was $75 million, or 38 cents a diluted share,
down from $84.9 million, or 43 cents a diluted share, in the
quarter a year earlier. The per-share figures reflect the company's
recent 2-for-1 stock split.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the charge and other special items, earnings for the
second quarter increased 16.8 percent, to $78.2 million, or 40
cents a diluted share. Operating profit at the company came in at
$145.1 million for the second quarter, a gain of 13.9 percent
compared with figures from the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue grew 3.8 percent, to $749.2 million.

   Operating profit at the company's newspaper group, which
comprises The New York Times, The Boston Globe and 21 regional
newspapers, rose 8.4 percent in the second quarter, to $129.5
million, from $119.4 million in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising revenue at the newspaper group rose 7.1 percent in
the quarter, the result of higher ad rates and volume. This
improvement was partly offset by an 18 percent increase in
newsprint costs. Ad revenue at The New York Times was up 9 percent
in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that weekday circulation fell at both The
Times, down 1.5 percent, and at The Globe, which lost nine-tenths
of 1 percent. Weekday circulation at the regional newspapers
increased five-tenths of 1 percent. Sunday circulation fell 2.4
percent at The Times during the second quarter and inched up 1
percent at The Globe and two-tenths of a percent at the regional
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profit at the company's broadcast group rose 14.3
percent, to $13.6 million, from $11.9 million in the quarter a year
earlier. This group, eight network-affiliated television stations
and two New York City radio stations, produced revenues of $41
million, up 5.6 percent from revenues in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The company's magazine division showed a 29.8 percent increase
in operating profit in the second quarter.

NAPALM PROTESTERS GATHER TO MEET TRAIN SHIPMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RUTH RENDON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEER PARK, Texas _ As a train loaded with napalm approached the
area Thursday, a small group of demonstrators here protested plans
to recycle the Vietnam-era jellied gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The first shipment, sent from a naval ammunitions depot near San
Diego to the GNI Group, was expected to arrive in the Houston area
late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It was being shipped by the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe
Railway Co. The napalm was to be taken off its train at the Hobby
Airport-area railyard and then loaded onto a truck to travel to the
GNI plant.
</P>
<P>
   Despite assurances from GNI and Navy officials that the napalm,
with detonators removed, is less dangerous than gasoline in its
liquid form, about a dozen members of the grass-roots organization,
Texans United, gathered on Thursday to protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are calling on our political leaders today to step up to
the plate and support these citizens in their efforts to stop this
latest scheme concerning napalm,'' said Jim Baldauf with the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, most from the Channelview area, met at an east
Harris County shopping center to voice their concerns about the 3.4
million gallons of napalm that will be brought to the GNI plant
over two years. The U.S. Navy granted GNI a $9 million contract
last week to handle the napalm recycling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an Army veteran. I was a veteran when the United States
military was in the business of protecting its citizens rather than
attacking its citizens,'' said Baldauf, 54, an independent oil
company employee from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not reacting here to wartime images of napalm. We are
reacting to one more battle in the chemical war that has been waged
on the Ship Channel population for decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldauf, who said he is on the board of Texans United, and
others said they are concerned about the emissions when the napalm,
which consists of benzene, gasoline and polystyrene, is
incinerated. Channelview residents, they say, receive the brunt of
the toxic emissions from Deer Park's chemical facilities because of
prevailing winds.
</P>
<P>
   GNI officials, however, said there will not be any emissions
because the recycling process is closed. The Deer Park company
plans to process the napalm so that it can be recycled for use as
an alternative fuel. It will then be used at still undetermined
locations out of state, said Bill Reeves, vice president of
regulatory affairs for GNI.

 Electricity Prices Surge In the Heat   By Kenneth Howe  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
California's heat wave is causing electricity prices in the state's
new power market to soar _ and testing for the first time whether
deregulation can actually lower energy costs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   While temperatures topped 100 degrees in many parts of
California yesterday, the wholesale price of electricity during the
hottest part of the day climbed to more than 10 cents per kilowatt
hour, according to figures from the California Power Exchange.
That's a 300 percent increase over the 21/2-cent per kilowatt
average price for all of last year, when the electricity market was
regulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the highest prices we've had,'' said Ed Freudenburg,
a spokesman for the Power Exchange, a nonprofit organization
created to serve as a marketplace where electric power is bought
and sold through an electronic auction every day. ``In fact, since
the July 4th holiday, we've been setting records nearly every
day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers won't immediately feel any effect from higher
wholesale electricity prices because utility rates have been capped
by law at current levels for four years. But rates actually were
expected to decline before those four years were up. That means if
the utilities have to pay higher prices for power, rates could stay
at their high level for the full period, depriving consumers of a
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The skyrocketing electricity prices are quite a turnaround from
the spring, when cool weather actually pushed the wholesale price
of electricity on the Power Exchange to zero during some hours.
</P>
<P>
   Before the recent spike, average daily Power Exchange prices
swung widely from a fraction of a penny per kilowatt to just more
than 3 cents. The overall average since deregulation began March 31
is 1.48 cents per kilowatt hour.
</P>
<P>
   But now, hot weather is causing people to flip on
electricity-consuming fans and air conditioners, so electricity has
been in high demand. And, in California's new deregulated market,
when demand goes up, prices jump, too.
</P>
<P>
   The current jump in the price of electricity for normal usage
follows a similar surge in the cost of backup electric power last
week. The wholesale price for ``replacement reserve power'' in
California briefly skyrocketed as high as $9,900 per megawatt from
a normal $5 to $10 per megawatt. The price has since come down.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind electricity deregulation in California was to
break up the monopoly held by the state's investor owned utilities,
such as San Francisco-based Pacific Gas and Electric Co. By
allowing many companies to sell the electricity they generated in
an open market, the price of electricity was supposed to decline.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed it did during the spring when electricity demand was
low. In fact, some generating companies were giving electricity
away during the middle of the night. For some plants, which can be
like huge steam kettles that take hours to heat up, it was cheaper
to let them run than shut them down and fire them up later.
</P>
<P>
   But if the spring was a buyer's market, the summer is a
seller's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, this is a test of deregulation,'' said Mike Florio, a
board member of the Power Exchange and a senior attorney with The
Utility Reform Network, a consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we're not happy with electricity at 10 cents a
kilowatt, but this is what you'd expect in a well-functioning
market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Florio said it will take a longer period of time to judge
whether prices on the whole under deregulation are lower than when
utilities ran the power system. ``But I'm pretty confident that if
you take the low and high prices together, we'll come out ahead,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to compare with any accuracy daily wholesale
electricity prices this year with last year. Before deregulation
the state's utilities simply generated power and the state Public
Utilities Commission regulated what they could charge for an
overall rate, which worked out to be about 21/2 cents per kilowatt
hour.
</P>
<P>
   The high prices over the last two weeks are well above that 21/2
cents per kilowatt average, but that might not be bad for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``New companies are going to look at California and see that
there's money to be made,'' said Jim Macias, PG&AMP;E's senior vice
president and general manager of generation transmission and
supply. ``If you belive in a free market, that will eventually
lower prices because you'll have more supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio agreed. ``Building new power plants now is actually good
news for consumers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale for this apparently contradictory argument, he
said, is that the latest natural-gas-fired plants are cheaper to
build, more efficient and produce far less pollutants than many of
California's older generators, which need to be closed.

 Record-Breaking Performance by Nasdaq Not That Significant   By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
So the Nasdaq cracked 2,000.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And Chicago Cub slugger Sammy Sosa cracked 20 homers in May,
breaking the major league individual record for the number of
dingers hit in a given month. Records are meant to be broken, but
not all such feats are always that meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's doesn't seem to be. His record won't tell us who's going
to be the best home-run hitter. &UR;  &LR; The outfielder probably will still
finish third at the end of the season among major league home run
swatters behind Mark McGwire and Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Nasdaq's record performance that poignant. Guessing if
and when the composite index would break through the 2,000 mark
made for good water-cooler wagering, but the tech-laden index
doesn't tell the full story of what's driving the bull market.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of stocks, perhaps the top seven, listed on Nasdaq are
the ones doing the heavy lifting. Tech stocks with beefy market
capitalizations, such as Microsoft, Intel, Dell and Cisco Systems,
are pushing the Nasdaq over 2,000. In short, what is driving the
broader market to record-shattering heights are large-cap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: The S&AMP;P 500 rose 17.7 percent during the first six
months of this year, while the Russell 2000 _ a small-cap index _
increased only 5 percent. And on closer inspection, the largest 100
stocks in the S&AMP;P 500 vaulted almost 21 percent compared to its
smallest 100 stocks, which saw a rise of only 8 percent, according
to Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst Leah Modigliani in New York.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the 100 biggest stocks in the S&AMP;P 500 accounted for
77 percent of the total increase of the index during the first half
of the year. In fact, Microsoft alone accounted for nearly 70
percent of that rise.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the smallest 100 stocks in the S&AMP;P were
responsible for less than 1 percent of the index's gain, Modigliani
points out.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it doesn't take a rocket-scientist to recognize this
trend. But sometimes stock pickers need to take a step back and
remind themselves of the obvious, Modliani says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is that people have to realize how narrow
the market is, even on an historical basis,'' Modigliani says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Modigliani isn't advocating that investors run out and
load up on a bunch of new big-cap stocks. They are expensive right
now. But by increasing existing positions in their best-performing
big-cap holdings, investors might have better chances of keeping up
with the leading market indices.
</P>
<P>
   The big-caps are getting much of the action, she says, because
nervous investors are looking for comfort in names they know. They
are worried about their stocks hitting the rocky shoals of the
Asian economic crisis. ``Some people view most big-cap stocks as
safe stocks,'' Modigliani says.
</P>
<P>
   Unless of course, one of those big-cap stocks was Cendant.
</P>
<P>
   Double Take
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Internet stocks continually tell skeptics to focus on
revenue growth. So one would figure that DoubleClick, an Internet
advertising company, would have been sitting pretty Wednesday after
the company &UR;  &LR; reported a 33 percent jump in revenues for the past
quarter to $17.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   But guess what? Investors gandered at the bottom line and
weren't impressed. That's because the online concern reported its
losses (You didn't expect profits did you?) more than tripled to
$4.7 million compared to the same quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick's shares were slammed yesterday, falling 8 percent
to $48.83. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Oops. Even if you buy into the rationale that Internet stocks
don't have to make money, you would at least like to see them lose
a little less each quarter before the stock takes off.
</P>

 Phone `Crammer' Cheated 500,000   By Jonathan Marshall  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
As many as half a million Californians have been ``crammed'' _ a
form of telecommunications fraud _ by a Boca Raton firm, state
regulators said yesterday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The company, Coral Communications, was raided Monday by agents
of the California Public Utilities Commission and the district
attorneys offices of Kings, San Mateo, Monterey and Tulare
counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what we've seen, including inspection of their
facilities, these problems go far beyond regulatory matters,'' said
Bill Schulte, director of the PUC's consumer services division. ``I
am personally shocked and appalled at the behavior we've uncovered
in terms of the sheer volume and scope of abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulte said consumer losses probably ran into the millions of
dollars. ``We are committed to obtaining restitution for each and
every victim,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC has interviewed 300 California consumers who were
charged by Coral, on their Pacific Bell bill, for services they
never ordered, a fraud known as cramming. In some cases, customers
filled out sweepstakes forms without noticing the tiny print saying
that their signature would authorize monthly payments for calling
cards they never received.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Coral's victims included the Kings County DA's
office and a phone line used by Kings County to check on the
whereabouts of parolees.
</P>
<P>
   No one answered a phone call to Coral seeking comment yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Coral began doing business in California last fall without legal
certification by the PUC. In response to a complaint from the PUC,
Pacific Bell stopped putting Coral's charges on its phone bills by
the beginning of March.
</P>
<P>
   Coral also has been sued by the attorneys general of Illinois
and Missouri for deceptive business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Cramming has grown in recent months to include a wide variety of
unauthorized services _ including psychic hotlines, travel clubs
and other memberships _ charged to phone bills. Federal and state
regulators say it has become a huge problem in just the past year.
</P>
<P>
   In response to consumer complaints about cramming, the Federal
Trade Commission filed charges against three billing companies
yesterday: International Telemedia Associates in Georgia, Online
Consulting Group in Florida and Hold Billing Services in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   An FTC spokeswoman said the agency has received 6,000 consumer
complaints in the past 10 months about cramming. But she said the
consumer protection agency suspects that the real number of victims
is far higher because most people don't notice small charges that
pop up on their bill and thus never realize they've been crammed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a company called Future Telephone Corp. crammed 40,000
people in Southern California with innocuous-sounding ``service
charges'' of $7.95 and a ``tax'' of $1.04, before the Los Angeles
City Attorney's office and PUC shut the fraud down.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC recently turned over a Top-10 list of crammers to the
California District Attorney's Association for investigation. In
the state Legislature, bills in both the Assembly and Senate would
make it much easier for authorities to crack down on unauthorized
phone billing. And Pacific Bell said it no longer will bill for
services not closely related to telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC also has set up a special toll-free number that victims
of Coral can call to help with the investigation: (800) 900-3985.

 Zapata Takes Over Bianca's Smut Shack   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Ay Caramba!
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Houston company named after the movie ``Viva Zapata!''
yesterday bought its 24th Web site since April.
</P>
<P>
   Zapata Corp., a fish processor that is reinventing itself as an
online contender, has purchased San Francisco-based BiancaTroll
Productions Inc., best known for Smut Shack &UR; ,  &LR; a sex-oriented chat
room. Zapata said 80,000 people a day visit Bianca's chat rooms,
which also feature topics such as religion, family and hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   Bianca is considered a crucial piece in Zapata's newfound
strategy to create an online community to rival America Online and
cash in on the Internet boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what we can tell, (Zapata) seems to have a good grasp on
what they want to do online,'' Bianca co-founder Dave Thau said.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been laughed at before as a fish-oil company going high
tech, but we don't take it personally,'' Zapata CEO Avie Glazer
said. ``And let me assure you, no one is laughing anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Zapata has been on a cyber-shopping spree since late May, when
it drew guffaws from industry observers after it offered $1.7
billion for Excite Inc. The Redwood City-based Internet directory
summarily dismissed the offer, which was faxed at night.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Zapata said it had bought or invested in 21 other Web
sites. Its own Web site, Zap.com, features a flashing sign that
reads, ``Zap will buy your Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one analyst, Jonathan Cohen of New York-based Merrill
Lynch, now recommends the stock after laughing at the Excite bid
while commenting on CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Wall Street is beginning to take Zapata seriously. The
company has shown gains in sales and profits during the past two
years and is debt-free with $117 million in cash, according to
Glazer.
</P>
<P>
   Zapata shares rose $1.13 to $22.81 yesterday _ triple the price
where it began this year.
</P>
<P>
   More important, it is fashioning a super Web site, called
Zap.com ( &LR; www.zap.com &LR; ), that incorporates its recently acquired
Web sites and e-commerce services. Among its properties are
Bibliofind, an online book-seller; Mass Music, a CD site; and
Travel Page, for online reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are creating a site that consumers will want to visit and
have no reason to leave,'' Glazer said. ``We're going to shock a
lot of people and create one of the largest Internet companies in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Glazer said Zapata also has reached agreements to
buy an unspecified number of Internet-related businesses. However,
he declined to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``We may never be done (with Net buyouts),'' Glazer said.
</P>
<P>
   Started by former President George Bush in 1953, Zapata has
taken strategic detours before. It began as an oil exploration and
currently makes most of its money selling fish meal and sausage
casings.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that Bush got the company's name after walking by
a marquee advertising the 1952 movie ``Viva Zapata!'' starring
Marlon Brando and Anthony Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman said Bush wanted a moniker that could be
listed in the front or back of a telephone book.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sold his stake in the company in 1963. Zapata continued in
the oil business until 1994, when it was taken over by tycoon
Malcom Glazer, Avie's father.
</P>
<P>
   Zapata is just part of the Glazer family's billion-dollar
holding company. Its other properties include the National Football
League's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, TV stations, real estate, restaurant
equipment, banks and health care facilities.

 c. 1998 N.Y. Times New Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Return on shareholder equity, often cited as a leading benchmark
of corporate performance, has been running at high levels for a
number of years and is showing few signs of easing.
</P>
<P>
   For the 12 months ended March 31, companies in the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index recorded an average return on equity of 18.5
percent, according to data from Salomon Smith Barney. That is up
from the average rate of 17.9 percent over the last five years and
sharply higher than the 13.7 percent recorded for the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons like these suggest that corporate managers are doing
a good job for shareholders and that stocks are not trading at
wildly inflated prices.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts maintain that the ratio _ which shows the
amount of earnings produced for each dollar shareholders have
invested _ is no longer the solid indicator that it once was, and
that today's numbers overstate how well companies are doing by
their shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Ciesielski, publisher of the Analyst's Accounting Observer,
a Baltimore-based research service for securities analysts, is one
of the skeptics.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does return on equity give us meaningful information? &QL; 
A. Return on equity is not as accurate an indicator of a company's
performance as it was 15 years ago. It is a scorecard, but I am not
sure it is as good a scorecard as it was in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The really high rates of return you are seeing now are kind
of a mirage, because of things like write-offs, accounting changes,
restructuring charges and stock buybacks.
</P>
<P>
   All of those things are pumping up the rate but they are not
giving us a true return on equity. In short, they create
distortions.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Things like restructuring charges are often one-time
phenomena. Are there factors out there that on an annual basis
contribute to distorted return-on-equity numbers? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. One really big booster, and one that has stayed with us, is
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 106, which forced
companies to cut equity due to their health care liability. That
statement took a big chunk out of equity and put it on the
liability side.
</P>
<P>
   Another is Statement 121, which has to do with hard, long-term
assets. Companies had to assess if those assets were going to
generate their worth in cash flow. It caused a lot of companies to
spring for charges in the mid-1990s, and gave them an incentive to
be aggressive in what they were going to write down.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you saying that in order to look good, some companies
play accounting games to generate a higher return on equity? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think they specifically will try to attain higher
return on equity, because that is not what investors look for in
every quarterly reporting period. Investors are looking for
exciting earnings comparisons. A higher return on equity is a
byproduct of those higher earnings. Coincidentally, earnings drive
return on equity, which may be linked to compensation plans.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there companies or industries where return on equity is
still as valuable a measure as it used to be?
</P>
<P>
   A. I still look at it in particular companies. For example, I
use it when I look at companies that have been relatively free of
charges, or haven't taken a lot of write-downs. Companies in the
services business tend to fall into that category, because they
don't have a lot of hard assets. Over time, the return on equity in
those companies would probably be pretty consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can investors interpret inconsistent return-on-equity
numbers?
</P>
<P>
   A. Measures like return on equity are out there to be analyzed.
But a lot of people just take them at their face value; they don't
massage them.
</P>
<P>
   In order to get a better picture, you have to try and smooth
things out. Instead of excluding charges, for example, you have to
average them out over a number of years. And you have to do the
same thing in the equity denominator, which is determined by
dividing net income by outstanding equity.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you expect the high return-on-equity numbers we have seen
to begin weakening anytime soon?
</P>
<P>
   A. Corporate profitability hasn't slackened that much, so I
don't expect return on equity to start falling a lot. Until you get
flat earnings for a few quarters, I don't think you will see it.
</P>
<P>
   And, as long as there are write-offs, restructurings and the
like, companies can keep the rate of return on equity pumped up.
But is that measure the real sustainable earnings power of the
equity? I am on the fence about that.

   LOCKHEED CALLS OFF MERGER WITH NORTHROP GRUMMAN
</P>
<P>
   Faced with continued resistance from the government, Lockheed
Martin has abandoned its planned $8.3 billion acquisition of
Northrop Grumman Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The decision followed months of negotiations between the
companies and the government to avoid a court fight. The deal's
breakup signals the end of a wave of consolidation that swept
through the military industry after the Cold War ended.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. PRESSED IMF ON RUSSIAN AID
</P>
<P>
   Seven weeks ago, the International Monetary Fund was playing
down the crisis in Russia. This week, in an about-face, the fund
and the Russian government announced a bailout package that will
inject $17.1 billion in new loans to the nation. The Clinton
administration was the driving force behind the reversal. Treasury
officials were worried that while negotiations with the Russians
dragged on, the political peril to President Boris Yeltsin's
government was growing.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Parliament agreed to a national sales tax, giving
the government a surprise victory in its effort to pass an economic
austerity plan.
</P>
<P>
   UNRESOLVED CHIQUITA QUESTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Despite a furor over The Cincinnati Enquirer's retreat from a
stinging series on reputed influence peddling by Chiquita Brands
International, some of the allegations cannot be dismissed so
easily.
</P>
<P>
   INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION FALLS
</P>
<P>
   The nation's industrial production declined during June for the
first time in four months. Most of the drop reflected an 11 percent
decline in automotive production because of the General Motors
strike.
</P>
<P>
   MIXED RESULTS FOR COLA GIANTS
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola said earnings fell in the second quarter, but Pepsico
reported a gain in earnings. Pepisco said it released its results
earlier than scheduled because Wall Street had pushed down the
price of its shares about 8 percent this week.
</P>
<P>
   DELTA POSTS 20 PERCENT RISE IN PROFIT
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines reported a 20 percent gain in quarterly earnings
on low fuel prices and strong passenger bookings. The results
exceeded expectations, but Delta's stock fell 1.2 percent, to
$135.50, on disappointment the gains were not even stronger. The
stock reached a 52-week high on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   GAINS AT SBC AND AMERITECH
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications and Ameritech, which plan to merge, posted
earnings that were slightly better than expected. Both companies
cited strong demand for data services and heavy sales of features
like call waiting.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTIONS ON STOCK BUYBACK PLANS
</P>
<P>
   Stock buybacks have typically bolstered share prices. But with
stock prices at record highs, aggressive buybacks look increasingly
dicey.
</P>
<P>
   POSTAL SERVICE'S CYCLING CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Postal Service is sponsoring the only U.S.-based team
competing in the Tour de France, the 2,400-mile-long bicycle race
now under way. Why cycling as a marketing opportunity? For one, the
Postal Service is getting a fair amount of exposure, helped by the
surprisingly strong showing of George Hincapie of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   TAPES HEARD IN PRICE-FIXING CASE
</P>

   In the price-fixing trial of three former Archer Daniels Midland
executives, secret government recordings of discussions on pricing
lysine, a food additive, were played in public for the first time.

 Nasdaq Breaks 2,000 Barrier   By Arthur M. Louis  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The Nasdaq composite index pushed past 2,000 yesterday for the
first time _ just three years minus a day after it first topped
1,000.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It marked another triumph for the nation's leading
high-technology companies, which dominate the 5,104-company Nasdaq
index and have sent it soaring more than 27 percent so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Things were touch and go throughout the day, as the index _
which closed Wednesday at 1,994.54 _ repeatedly bobbed above the
2,000 barrier, then retreated.
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers let out a collective groan when it appeared _
just after the close at 1 p.m. Pacific Standard Time _ that the
index had fallen short by the scantest of margins, finishing at
1,999.99.
</P>
<P>
   But the final settlement of trades in the minute or two after
the close sent the index creeping up to 2,000.56 _ a gain of 6.02
points, or 0.3 percent, on the day.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Walker, a spokesman for Nasdaq, said market officials
didn't pop any champagne corks or otherwise celebrate the
penetration of the 2,000 barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The celebration is in the companies,'' he said. ``It's their
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly ignored in the cliff-hanging excitement was the fact that
the other leading market indexes _ the Dow Jones industrial average
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 _ performed better than the Nasdaq
yesterday and also set new records.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, made up of 30 blue-chip companies, surged beyond 9,300
for the first time, finishing up 93.72 points, or 1.0 percent, at
9.328.19.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500, composed almost entirely of the largest companies
traded on the New York Stock Exchange, gained 9.21 points, or 0.8
percent, to 1,184.02.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was created on Feb. 5, 1971 at a
starting value of 100. It consists of all 5,104 issues on the
Nasdaq National Market and the Nasdaq Small Cap Market.
</P>
<P>
   Its 20-fold increase in value since Day One works out to an
average annual gain of 11.5 percent. That is well ahead of both the
S&AMP;P 500 and the Dow, which averaged 9.5 percent and 9.0 percent
annual gains respectively during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Market analysts point out that because the Nasdaq composite is
weighted by market capitalization, seven companies determine more
than 30 percent of the index's movement. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Most of those seven _ Microsoft, Intel, Cisco Systems, Dell
Computer, WorldCom, MCI Communications and Oracle _ have been
extremely strong performers this year, offsetting the lagging
performance of thousands of other Nasdaq stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nasdaq as a whole is not doing quite so well,'' said Rick
Eakle, of Eakle Associates in Fair Haven, N.J. ``The index is being
distorted by a handful of names.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, the biggest company in the index by far with 12.2
percent of the total market value, has gained 81.6 percent this
year. Dell is up an astounding 170.8 percent, WorldCom is up 81.5
percent, Cisco is up 71.7 percent and MCI is up 56.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The only members of the Big Seven that have trailed the overall
Nasdaq index this year are Oracle, which nevertheless has gained
24.1 percent, and Intel, which is up 19.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Turner, president of Pring Turner Capital Management in San
Ramon, suggested that investors should look for bargains among the
smaller Nasdaq stocks that have ``languished,'' rather than trying
to ride the big companies to further gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking for bargains _ that's the only fascination I find in
this new record,'' he said. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Alfred Goldman, a technical analyst with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Son in
St. Louis, said it is ``interesting that Nasdaq made it to the
millennium before mankind did.'' He expects it to keep surging over
the near term, because ``the economy is good'' and ``the mood and
outlook about the Asian crisis has turned more positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Welty, of Welty Capital Management in Lafayette, noted that
Microsoft _ which reported a strong quarterly earnings gain after
the market closed yesterday _ now has a market capitalization of
more than $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The only other company that matches it, he said, is General
Electric, ``which has six or seven times Microsoft's revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is now trading at 66 times last year's earnings.
It's a dilemma trying to decide what to tell clients who hold the
stock. Five years from now it probably will be higher, but there is
no room for error.''

 Computer Researchers Show Off Latest Gizmos   By Jamie Beckett  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Some of technology's most creative thinkers gathered in Silicon
Valley yesterday to describe and show off their latest ideas, which
ranged from a talking couch that tells you when your nap is over to
a pair of eyeglasses that double as a computer screen.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Companies that usually see themselves as competitors _ including
Microsoft, Xerox, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Apple and IBM _ sent
researchers to the New Paradigms in Computing annual conference at
IBM's Almaden Research Center in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers showed off their latest gizmos, while others
just talked about them.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Bell, who helped invent Digital Equipment Corp.'s
successful VAX minicomputer, described &UR;  &LR; a ``guardian angel'' that
you'd wear on your wrist that would have sensors to keep track of
blood pressure, heart rate, insulin levels and would alert you when
something goes awry.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who is now working at Microsoft's San Francisco research
lab, is working on a ``cyber admin'' that would catalog everything
you read and could call up anything from fragments of memory.
</P>
<P>
   Brewster Kahle, inventor of the landmark WAIS program for
finding documents on the Internet, described the newest invention
of his San Francisco-based company, Alexa: an intelligent Internet
navigator intended to learn from users.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Selker, the IBM fellow who organized the event, talked about
a world where tiny computers are everywhere, all responding to
humans' needs or wants _ keeping clothing comfortable and doing
blood tests without finger pricks.
</P>
<P>
   His contributions yesterday included the talking couch and a
``digital coach'' exercise machine that prodded a user on with a
drum beat and the voice of a Arnold Schwarzenegger-like trainer
urging, ``Come, let me pump you up.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Hayes-Roth, known for her work in artificial
intelligence, demonstrated software agents being developed by her
San Jose-based startup, Extempo. A dog named Max and a wizard named
Merlin were among the characters Extempo designed to make working
with a computer more like working with a person.
</P>
<P>
   Thad Starner, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology media lab, showed off the funny, thick eyeglasses that
also work as a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're actually fashionable frames from France,'' noted
Starner, who has been wearing the computer glasses for the past two
months.
</P>
<P>
   The glasses are connected by a cord to a hand-held keyboard
called the Twiddler, which is the size and shape of a hot dog bun.
Starner carried the keyboard in one hand and carried a credit
card-size computer &UR;  &LR; with a Pentium processor in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Using the computer and looking into a tiny screen embedded in
the glasses, Starner can take notes, read and answer e-mail, search
the Internet _ essentially do most anything you can normally do
with a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason you have to have a desktop machine,'' said
Starner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The desktop and laptop will go away because this is much
better for your eyes and hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The central theme of the conference was pervasive computing _ a
world in which computers are seamlessly integrated into daily life.
</P>
<P>
   But not all of the computer scientists in the crowd were
enthusiastic about this prospect: several had concerns about
invasions of privacy and one raised the specter of computers being
``incredibly intrusive and invasive everywhere.''

<P>
   So you've socked away a fortune, developed a passion for wine
and have decided to ditch the rat race, take to the country and
make an award-winning bottle of vino. Quite a goal, especially if
the closest you've come to agriculture for the last 30 years is
mowing the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, you never know. Consider Norman Kiken. He used to have the
tidy hands of an accountant, but now, they are nicked and scraped,
just like a farmer's, as he enters his fifth year as a winemaker in
the Napa Valley of Northern California. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kiken's interest in wine started innocently enough. It was 1973,
he was 30, and he read an article about wine in his dentist's
office while waiting for a root canal. With characteristic
enthusiasm, he plunged into intense study and tasting. Twenty years
later, to the shock of his New Jersey wine-tasting group, he quit
his job as chief financial officer at the Leucadia National
Corporation, an insurer in Manhattan, and with his wife, Evelyn,
headed west.
</P>
<P>
   Kiken (pronounced KICK-en) bought 40 acres on Diamond Mountain
in the Napa region, outside Calistoga, for $1.4 million and built
himself a home and a winery, called Reverie. His modest goal was to
make ``the best red wine in the world.'' He is not there yet, but
he is gaining considerable acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, The Wine Spectator cited Reverie as one of a dozen new
wineries to watch. Then came a recommendation by Robert Parker Jr.,
the wine rater. ``Terrific raspberry nose that leaps from the
glass,'' Parker wrote in his publication, The Wine Advocate, of
Kiken's 1995 Cabernet Franc, priced at $35. Kiken now sells every
bottle he produces, and his wines are on the lists of restaurants
like Jean Georges and the Four Seasons in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kiken has had more rapid success than others, he is by no
means the only winemaking refugee from the corporate world. Lewis
Perdue of Wine Investment News, an industry newsletter, calls it a
trend. ``There are certainly more of these change-of-life
winemakers now than 10 years ago,'' he said. ``It's a function of
people being successful in other careers who love wine and who like
the life style.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of them, he said, are dilettantes, people with vacation
homes in wine country who become weekend gentlemen-farmers.
``They'll plant a few acres of vines,'' Perdue said. ``But they
know nothing about making wine. They need the professional vineyard
management companies who can plan, run and harvest the vineyard.
They need consulting winemakers and enough facilities to lease.
This kind of support mechanism didn't exist 15 years ago. But now
it's in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Others get their hands dirty, and not just in Napa. Antony
Champ, the former chief executive of Fiber Industries, a polyester
producer in Charlotte, N.C., took a buyout offer in 1989 and wound
up making wine in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kiken, Champ was in his early '50s when he jumped corporate
ship. He and his wife, Edith, traveled around wine-growing areas
before deciding where to plant vines and build their home.
</P>
<P>
   They considered the West Coast, but not too seriously. ``We
could afford it,'' he said, ``but it's not our style. We're East
Coast people.''
</P>
<P>
   They dismissed upstate New York because of the cold winters.
Long Island? Too much traffic. They found a site in Crozet, Va.,
under the shadows of the Blue Ridge Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The Champs planted their grapes in 1991 and their winery, White
Hall, lost money for five years before breaking even on a cash-flow
basis last year. Reaching that point took longer _ and was more
backbreaking _ than Champ had thought.
</P>
<P>
   He joins vineyard managers and other hands in working the
fields. ``We currently have 18 acres with about 500 vines per
acre,'' he said.``We visit each vine about four times a season. We
tie them. Position them. Prune them. Weed them. We're walking the
acreage. And consider that right now it's in the high 90s down
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the fall crush comes, we harvest the fruit into lugs,''
he said, referring to the containers used to convey the ripe
grapes. ``Last year we handled 57 tons of grapes, so we're carrying
all of that in 30-pound parcels at a time. During the crush,
especially if we have to pick the grapes quickly before bad weather
comes, we could be having 20-hour days.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Champs have no complaints. The winemaking life, they
say, is refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In parts of the business world, people will cut your throat
for a tenth of a cent, but not here,'' he said. ``If you're in a
jam, people help you out in this industry. It's more about
community than making money.''  &QL;

 UNDATED: making money.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the most part, this is a labor of love, not a fabulous
investment. First-time winemakers hear ad nauseam the old joke:
``How to make a small fortune in the wine business? Start with a
large one.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps to have work experience that can translate. Champ had a
background in chemistry and experience in marketing. And when
Leucadia invested in a financially troubled California winery,
Kiken learned about the potential financial pitfalls of the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Kiken had no marketing or sales experience, so he has learned on
the fly about finding distributors and working the market, choosing
to sell only in California and states he likes to visit: New York,
New Jersey and Florida. On such trips, he makes contacts and sales
calls and attends trade shows. He also publishes a chatty
semiannual newsletter, updating winery visitors about the harvest,
new varietals and the like.
</P>
<P>
   But can such vintners make money? That is generally not the
goal, Perdue said. ``When people make life-style choices like this,
they're looking for a break-even situation, or something that
doesn't lose too much money,'' he said. ``Having a gigantic return
on assets doesn't figure in as one of the prime considerations.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vic Motto of Motto, Kryla &AMP; Fisher, an accounting firm in St.
Helena, Calif., specializing in the wine industry, has held
people's hands through the winemaking process for 16 years. ``If
you don't have a million dollars of annual discretionary assets,
you probably shouldn't even think of entering the market,'' Motto
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical winemaker with a winery invests $3 to $5 for every
dollar of sale, less for a custom crush,'' he added. ``Can you make
money? Maybe in 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a devoted winemaker can see a decent return, especially
by entering the market with wine that sells for at least $20 a
bottle. ``Wine has never been as profitable as it has been in the
past three years,'' said Jon Fredrickson of Gomberg, Fredrickson &AMP;
Associates, a San Francisco company that tracks the industry.
``There have been at least 10 times more successful start-up
wineries than failures.''
</P>
<P>
   The typical winery investor who visits Mark Brody, a vice
president and manager at the commercial banking office of Sanwa
Bank in San Francisco, is male and 50 or older _ and someone who
could easily start his business without a loan but does not want to
tie up that much cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go for so many years without making a dime in this
business,'' Brody said, ``that people who come to us for wine money
must have deep pockets themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Napa Valley is the most expensive viticultural area in the
country. Land already planted with disease-resistant, grape-bearing
vines sells for more than $60,000 an acre. Plantable land costs
considerably less _ $20,000 an acre. But going the bargain route
involves as many as five years for the vines to bear usable fruit,
and a minimum of two more years to get the bottles on the shelves.
That is a seven-year wait to see any return on investment _ six
years if the product is white wine, which requires less aging.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the large overhead involved, prudent newcomers ease
their way into the business. The cheapest way to start _ the
``custom crush'' methods _ is to rent equipment and to buy other
people's grapes.
</P>
<P>
   This path is commonplace; Kiken said it takes $250,000 to
produce a modest 2,500 cases. Three to four years later, when those
cases finally reach the shelves, profitability is unlikely, but
cash-flow break-even can be reached, he said, if the bottles each
sell at $22 to $23.
</P>
<P>
   A key point in this kind of operation is to sign up a
high-profile winemaker as a consultant, even though these services
might start at $18,000 and run as high as six figures for a few
months of work. Such consultants can provide contacts for buying
the crucial, first-rate grapes, and can attract attention for a new
winery _ assuring that premium prices can be charged, even by an
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Produced this way, a red wine, from crush to bottle, could be
ready for that Robert Parker rating in little more than 18 months.
Kiken started out on a variation of this plan, but he always used
his own grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with a custom job,'' Kiken said,
``except that the more control you have over your wine, the more
you can control your own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Brody, the banker, warns every prospective winery owner seeking
a loan about the risks and the barriers. Even so, he admits to some
envy. With complete conviction, he said, ``Doesn't everyone who
loves wine have a dream to make it?''

LOS ANGELES TO REDUCE POLLUTION FROM LAKE BED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Striking a compromise after decades of bitter
conflict, representatives of Los Angeles and the Owens Valley
agreed on Wednesday to a plan for reducing severe air pollution 225
miles north of here on the dry bed of Owens Lake, which Los Angeles
drained in the 1920s to build its modern metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   The 110-square-mile lake, on the eastern slope of the Sierra
Nevada, is the single worst source of air pollution in the United
States, and air quality officials in the Owens Valley had wanted
Los Angeles to cover some 35 square miles of the lake bed in a mix
of gravel, water and vegetation to hold down dust storms that
violate air quality standards.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, officials of the Los Angeles Department of Water
and Power and the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control
District agreed to a plan in which Los Angeles will treat 10 square
miles of the lake by 2001 and an additional 6.5 miles by 2003. At
that time, Owens Valley officials will review the effects and
propose a new plan for meeting federal air standards by 2006. If
Los Angeles does not agree with that plan, it will still have to
treat an additional two square miles of the lake bed each year
until the standards are met.

ZAMORA'S ATTORNEY MAY SEEK NEW TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
 
(Resending to correct name of prosecutor, Mike Parrish, not
Parish) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAN JARVIS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Testimony from a new witness given during
David Graham's trial Wednesday has prompted an attorney for Diane
Zamora to consider seeking a new trial for his client, who in
February was convicted of capital murder in the death of
16-year-old Adrianne Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a possibility, but we haven't crossed that bridge yet,''
said Zamora's defense attorney, John Linebarger of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence on which Linebarger said he might base an
appeal was presented Wednesday when Wendy Bartlett, a former
cross-country teammate of Jones and Graham. Bartlett testified that
she drove Jones home from a track meet the night that Graham said
in his police confession that the two had a tryst.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Mike Parrish said Wednesday that investigators were
unaware of the new witness until a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Linebarger said that he had heard rumors that there was new
evidence by a witness who would testify in Graham's trial. ``Quite
frankly, I was shocked when I heard that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Linebarger said prosecutors have never given him Bartlett's name
as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora, Graham's former fiancee, was convicted in the fatal
beating and shooting of Jones, a Mansfield High School sophomore.
Graham is on trial in New Braunfels, Texas, in that killing.
</P>
<P>
   Linebarger said he will probably ask for a hearing to supplement
the record on the appeal that has been filed in Zamora's case. To
do that, Linebarger said, he will have to file an out-of-time
motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, attorneys have 30 days after their client is found
guilty to file. But Linebarger said that based on the new evidence,
he believes he can file for a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will wait until after the Graham trial to file for a
new trial because he wants to get a transcript of the testimony.

DAEWOO GIVES AMERICA THE OLD COLLEGE TRY

(JT) 
 By JOSEPH SIANO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The newest car company in the United States, Daewoo Motor
America, has been recruiting college students across the United
States in recent months to help sell its line of economy cars. The
company, a unit of a South Korean conglomerate, offers prospective
campus representatives free trips to Korea with no obligation.
</P>
<P>
   With commissions of $300 to $500 a car, some parents may respond
to their children's next ``send money'' plea by sending them to
Seoul. One potential pitfall, though, is that Daewoo (pronounced
DAY-woo) is aiming much of its sales pitch at those very same
college students, a demographic group without steady incomes, big
savings accounts or long credit histories.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, where it has sold cars since 1995, Daewoo has won a
loyal following by spurning independent dealerships and selling
directly to consumers. Now it is trying the same approach here,
with the added twist of taking aim at college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the college market for a couple of reasons,'' said
Bill Tucker, vice president of marketing and customer relations for
Daewoo. ``We think the car will have appeal because of the price
point. And we also feel college students are open-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   Value will be the company's main selling point for its three
models _ the subcompact Lanos, the compact Nubira and the midsize
Leganza sedan. Prices, which have not been officially set, will
range from $9,000 to $20,000. Customers will get three years' free
maintenance, including oil changes; a three-year, 36,000-mile
warranty and free roadside assistance. And like Saturn, Daewoo will
use a set-price, no-haggle approach.
</P>
<P>
   Maryann Keller, the auto industry analyst for ING Baring Furman
Selz in New York, said: ``I think that while Daewoo's strategy is
different, I'm hard-pressed to see how it's going to make money for
them. The college-student market is a very difficult market. They
don't have a lot of money, they are first-time buyers, and they
have no credit rating.'' So, Ms. Keller noted, Daewoo actually has
to win over the students' parents.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said Daewoo is aware of the need for financing. ``We're
looking at things that help get payments in the realm that students
can afford,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo's venture in the American market, after it missed
previously announced debuts, comes at a time of crisis for Korean
companies. The economy has been in a free-fall since the currency
was devalued last fall, consumer demand has dried up and big banks
are on the verge of collapse because of huge loans that are
unlikely to be repaid. Daewoo itself is heavily in debt.
</P>
<P>
   With car sales plunging in Korea and throughout much of Asia,
the Korean auto industry is operating at about 40 percent of
capacity. Kia, the country's third-largest car maker (Daewoo is
second, behind Hyundai), went up for auction on Wednesday. Daewoo
has been trying to sell a piece of itself to General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Until this month, Kia and Hyundai were offering rebates of up to
$1,500 on 1998 models, and up to $2,500 on leftover '97 cars.
Because Korea's currency, the won, is so cheap relative to the
dollar, it is theoretically possible for Korean companies to make
money by ramping up exports, slashing prices and offering big sales
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   For about eight years starting in the mid-1980s, GM and Daewoo
did get together, and the product was an ill-conceived car sold by
Pontiac as the LeMans. It suffered from poor quality and
disappointing sales.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said that Daewoo planned to have 14 factory-owned
dealerships open when it officially begins sales in the United
States in early September, and is considering independent
dealerships in the six states (including New Jersey) that do not
allow auto makers to sell directly to the public. By the end of the
year, the goal is 20 to 25 factory-owned stores, he said. Most will
be in metropolitan areas where there are several colleges. Cars
have already arrived here, and could be available for sale before
September (although the Daewoo outlet in Fairfield, Conn., which is
to open on Aug. 28, was empty last week except for some office
furniture). Tucker said sales of any amount from 10,000 to 30,000
in the first 12 months would be considered respectable.
</P>
<P>
   The British have given Daewoo's product a warm reception since
the company began factory-direct sales there. In the British
customer-satisfaction survey by J.D. Power &AMP; Associates for 1997,
the first in which Daewoo appeared, it finished fourth, behind
Subaru, Honda and Kia. Nearly half of each manufacturer's overall
score was based on dealer service. ``Daewoo customers are extremely
satisfied with the way they are treated,'' J.D. Power said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Daewoo dropped to ninth, but its rating was still
ahead of the average.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Keller, the analyst, said Daewoo might have underestimated
the choices available to Americans who want to avoid car dealers.
``We can get on the Web and arm ourselves with all sorts of
information, including what the car actually costs the dealer,''
she said. ``There are lots of car-buying services on the Web in
which a consumer will ask for a certain car and a dealer will come
back with a price.'' Students, too, would seem to be the people
most connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   If Daewoo's approach succeeds, the company can thank people like
Deborah Archer, who is among the first Daewoo campus advisers, as
the college representatives are called. Ms. Archer, 36, of Fort
Lee, N.J., can appreciate the financial possibilities of working
for Daewoo campus from the perspective of both parent and student.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, it was the economic factor that attracted me to
it,'' she said, when asked why she signed up for the program after
seeing a poster on campus. A single parent who has been studying
for a Masters of Science in education at Herbert H. Lehman College,
Ms. Archer has a daughter in a private grammar school and a
16-year-old son. ``I felt this is an excellent opportunity,'' she
said. ``The hours are flexible, and they said it wouldn't interfere
with my classes.''
</P>
<P>
   But after completing a screening process and flying to South
Korea with about 125 other American students, she came to admire
the South Korean way of life and business. ``The dedication of the
employees was outstanding,'' Ms. Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primarily, the other members of my group were in the 18- to
22-year-old range,'' she said. ``Out of 125, I would guess that 100
were men, and many of the students who responded were marketing and
business majors.'' During their 14- to 15-hour days (the one-week
trip ``was all very well organized,'' she said), the Americans were
introduced to the company's history, instructed on public relations
and marketing strategies and given a tour of the conglomerate's
auto, shipbuilding and electronics plants. ``We were told that our
goal was not to sell the car, but to spread the Daewoo name by word
of mouth,'' Ms. Archer said. One way they'll do this is through
on-campus activities sponsored by Daewoo.
</P>
<P>
   After one more training session in the United States, Ms. Archer
will be ready to round up prospects. To help, there's one more
perk: free use of a Daewoo for 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   The approach left Ms. Keller wondering about the turnover rate
on campus. ``They're going to spend a tremendous amount of money
training students in Korea, and what's going to happen when they
graduate?'' she asked. She also wondered whether students have
enough free time to be an effective sales force _ ``or maybe
college is different from when I attended.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Holloway, who owns five traditional dealerships in New
Hampshire and is chairman of the National Automobile Dealers
Association, is also a skeptic. ``Last year in the United States,
the average new-car dealer realized a 1.4 percent profit,'' he
said. ``And I think dealers bring a heck of a lot more value to the
equation than that 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very competitive business, and I don't see what kind
of costs Daewoo thinks they can take out of this.'' &QL;

HAMMEL ISN'T MAIN ATTRACTION, BUT SHE STEALS SHOW 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. _ After a convivial practice round on
Tuesday, Nancy Lopez conceded that she had won a few dollars from
Se Ri Pak in an informal ``closest-to-the-hole'' competition.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Lopez, 41, and Pak, 20, played for real in the
opening round of the JAL Big Apple Classic, and again Lopez came
out ahead. Grouped with Pak and a former JAL winner, Hiromi
Kobayashi of Japan, in front of by far the biggest gallery of the
day, Lopez fired a 3-under-par 68 while Pak carded a 1-over 72.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez's performance overshadowed that of another veteran,
36-year-old Penny Hammel, who has won four tournaments in a 14-year
pro career and had Thursday's best round at 64. Hammel's round,
which included an eagle and six birdies, was one stroke off the JAL
record of 63, set by Betsy King in 1990 in the event's first year.
</P>
<P>
   On a hazy and humid day when more than two dozen players broke
par on the tough 6,161-yard Wykagyl Country Club course, Hammel's
64 gave her a three-stroke lead over a group that included Annika
Sorenstam, a two-time winner of the U.S. Women's Open, and veteran
Juli Inkster, whose 16 titles include the 1992 JAL.
</P>
<P>
   Pak burst into prominence in the last two weeks by winning the
U.S. Women's Open and the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic, where she shot
a tour-record round of 61 last Friday. On Thursday, she started
strong with birdies at Nos. 2 and 3. But then three bogies, at Nos.
5, 12 and 16, left her with a 72. For Lopez it was the reverse. She
three-putted the first hole for her only bogey, then birdied Nos.
3, 5, 12 and 15. Later, Lopez, who missed the cut in her last three
outings, including the Open, conceded that playing with Pak
inspired her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing with Se Ri is a lot of fun, but it also gives you more
momentum,'' said Lopez, who has 48 titles.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said that playing with Pak _ who earlier this year won the
McDonald's LPGA Championship to become just the second rookie,
after Inkster, to win two majors _ evoked memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all reminds me of 20 years ago,'' Lopez said, referring to
her rookie year in 1978, when she won nine tournaments, including
five in a row.
</P>
<P>
   While as many as 1,000 spectators followed Lopez, Pak and
Kobayashi (who shot a 74), Hammel fashioned her 64 in virtual
anonymity. But Hammel, who is from Decatur, Ill., did not mind.
Having had only one top-10 finish in 18 tournaments this year, she
did not expect a large gallery. Nor did she expect to putt so well.
</P>
<P>
   She hit a 45-foot putt for an eagle at the par-5, 432-yard 15th
hole, after reaching in two with a 5-wood. Hammel also sank birdie
putts of 30, 25 and 20 feet at Nos. 6, 16 and 18.

SCHUMER LOOKS TO GUN CONTROL FOR JOLT TO CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``It is painful for all of us to refight a battle
once won,'' Sarah Brady, the gun-control advocate, said earlier
this week in announcing legislation that would extend a law named
after her husband, James, that expires this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the man fidgeting silently behind Mrs. Brady on the podium
seemed anything but pained. Rep. Charles Schumer, the New York City
Democrat who is seeking his party's nomination for the U.S. Senate,
is unabashedly excited that Congress is about to launch into a
potentially contentious debate over a law he helped write.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to distinguish himself from his Democratic rivals,
and facing criticism that he has lost effectiveness in Congress,
Schumer is counting on a loud and protracted gun-control fight with
conservative Republicans and the National Rifle Association to
inject some spark into his campaign _ just in time for the Sept. 15
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a dynamite issue in the campaign,'' he said in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   To Schumer and his aides, a full-throated debate on the Brady
law would be political manna, rekindling memories of one of
Schumer's greatest legislative victories. He was an author and
sponsor of the original Brady bill, which required background
checks and a five-day waiting period for handgun buyers in most
states.
</P>
<P>
   The measure's passage in 1993 represented a stunning defeat for
the powerful NRA, and it transformed Schumer from just another
aggressive New York politician into a national figure. He became a
ubiquitous presence on television, a spokesman for the gun-control
movement and the target of death threats. (He even took to wearing
homemade disguises when traveling in potentially hostile areas,
like the Rocky Mountains.)
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 30, the waiting-period requirement is scheduled to
expire. The rifle association and its allies, including the
Republican leadership in both houses, want it to die. Schumer and
gun-control advocates, including many police organizations, want to
extend it. The gun-control advocates have named their new bill
Brady 2, and they clearly hope the sequel will have the same
triumphant ending as the original.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be one of the few battle royals of this
Congress,'' contended Schumer, who has already begun spotlighting
gun control in speeches and commercials.
</P>
<P>
   All three of the Democrats in the race _ Schumer, Geraldine
Ferraro and Mark Green _ are strong supporters of gun control. But
Schumer is the most closely identified with the issue, pollsters
say. And now, having languished in second or third place in public
opinion polls, Schumer is clearly looking to a high-profile debate
to boost his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   First, a well-publicized battle could help close the
name-recognition gap separating him from Ms. Ferraro, the former
congresswoman and Vice-Presidential candidate, who is widely viewed
as the front-runner in the primary. Second, political strategists
say that gun control is popular among women, whom Ms. Ferraro is
counting on to overwhelmingly support her.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer also contends that gun control spotlights one of his
central campaign pledges. ``I can get things done,'' he said. ``I'm
given the credit for being the person who routed the NRA for the
first time in 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer says the real benefit will come in the general
election, if he reaches that point, against the three-term
Republican incumbent, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato is admired by detractors and supporters alike for his
ability to champion traditionally Democratic issues, like
increasing federal spending to fight breast cancer. But gun control
is not one of them; D'Amato has consistently voted against major
gun-control legislation, including the Brady bill, and his aides
suggested he probably would again this year.
</P>
<P>
   The rifle association has returned his support. Since 1991, its
political action committee has spent more than $21,000 helping his
campaigns, campaign finance records show.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato maintains that tougher criminal penalties against people
who commit crimes with guns is the best way to reduce gun violence.
And Republican strategists, as well as some Democratic ones, say
gun control is unlikely to be a factor in the fall elections, since
crime is down and voters seem generally content with incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer contends that D'Amato's gun-control positions show
he is beholden to special-interest groups and is out of step with
mainstream New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one person in the whole United States of America
who wishes this hadn't come up, it is probably Al D'Amato,'' he
said, chuckling. ``New York is probably the most pro-gun-control
state in the country. Running against him is the leading
gun-control advocate. It's almost a high-noon drama.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, potential risks in Schumer's strategy. While
a fight over Brady 2 could recall Schumer's triumphs, it also
serves as a reminder that those victories occurred four years ago _
and that he has had few accomplishments to boast of since.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the passage of the Brady law in 1993, followed by
enactment of the ban on assault weapons in 1994 _ a law that
Schumer also helped write _ were the pinnacle of his 18-year tenure
in Congress. But along came the Republican tide of 1994, relegating
Schumer to the minority.
</P>
<P>
   He relished that position for a time, lustily attacking
Republicans as radical right-wingers when they tried to cut social
programs or shut down the federal government. But when the
Republicans began working with President Clinton, to change welfare
or balance the budget, for example, Schumer's protest role was
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   And this year, because of his campaign schedule, he has missed
significantly more votes than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Though he contends he has done more than most Democrats in the
House, Schumer said it was inevitable that he would lose impact in
the minority. That is a major reason he wants to move to the
Senate, where one person has far more power to enact legislation
than in the more rule-bound House.

CIPOLLINI AVOIDS CRASH AND CRUISES

<P>
   CHATEAUROUX, France _ There was another crash near the finish of
the Tour de France's daily stage Thursday, but this time Mario
Cipollini, Il Magnifico, was not in the middle of the sprawled
bodies and bicycles as he has been twice this week.
</P>
<P>
   Cipollini, the star Italian sprinter for the Saeco team, was way
ahead of the accident _ about two bicycle lengths ahead of
everybody, in fact. He had plenty of time to raise his arms in his
usual triumphal benediction and even to glance back as if he
wondered where the rest of the 183-man pack was.
</P>
<P>
   Cipollini registered his first victory in the 85th Tour on the
kind of terrain he likes best: an extremely long straightaway at
the end of a flat, 142-mile fifth stage from Cholet to Chateauroux
in the heart of France.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting,'' he said of the earlier mishaps. ``This
was a perfect stage for me, and my teammates did everything
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Saeco riders led the train into this grimy city and then left
Cipollini to pour on the final coals himself. He easily finished
ahead of Erik Zabel, a German with Telekom, and Christophe Mengin,
a Frenchman with La Francaise des Jeux, second and third among a
swarm at the end of the mile-long straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   Cipollini was timed in 5 hours 18 minutes 49 seconds, an average
speed of 42 kilometers an hour, on a gloomy day with chilly
drizzles.
</P>
<P>
   In the contest for overall leadership, the Australian Stuart
O'Grady retained the yellow jersey as George Hincapie, an American
with U.S. Postal Service, moved up to second place overall by
finishing second in the first of three bonus time sprints to take
four seconds off his total elapsed time. Hincapie trails O'Grady by
seven seconds.

BROOKLYN ENTERTAINMENT COMPLEX PLANNED AT GOWANUS CANAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a sign that developers are increasingly forced to
scout out unlikely locales for new projects, a Manhattan company
said Thursday it would build a huge entertainment complex along the
Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn that would include the city's largest
multiplex movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   The project, to be known as Brooklyn Commons, would be part of a
stark modern steel and glass complex contrasting sharply with the
surrounding ragtag assemblage of what was once one of the city's
busiest manufacturing zones.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a 22-screen Loews theater, the complex would include a
bowling alley, athletic center, shops, restaurants, a 1,500-car
parking garage and a public esplanade along the Gowanus Canal. The
canal was dug in the 1860s to provide a manufacturing lifeline to
the New York Harbor but has been largely neglected in recent
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project is an indication that there is great market
demand to develop parts of town where, years ago, people would have
considered such things idle fantasy,'' said city Planning
Commissioner Joseph Rose, who has been a persistent advocate of
luring builders to little-used industrial areas, sometimes through
zoning changes.
</P>
<P>
   The developer, Millennium Partners, has several entertainment
complexes across the nation, including the Lincoln Square Complex
of movie theaters in Manhattan. The company plans to spend $63
million on the Gowanus project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having built entertainment centers of this kind before, we are
confident that New York City residents and visitors will find this
an exciting gathering place,'' Millennium Partners president
Christopher Jeffries said at a City Hall news conference with Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the project, planned for completion by 2000, could
be built without zoning changes and would not receive city tax
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, plans for the entertainment complex have not received
unqualified support from residents of the surrounding neighborhoods
of Park Slope and Carroll Gardens. The project is to be built on
the west side of Second Avenue, from 10th Street to 12th Street, on
land owned by the U.S. Postal Service. People in the neighborhood
said they worried about the traffic the complex would generate, and
wanted assurances that it would provide employment opportunities
and retail space for local residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this project is done properly, it can be wonderful,'' said
Ben Meskin, president of Care About the Slope, a community group
representing the south end of Park Slope. ``We just want the
developers to talk to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen DiBrienza, a City Council member representing
surrounding neighborhoods, said Thursday that the mayor's news
conference announcing the project had come as a shock to many
residents who did not think the developers had satisfied their
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``This an example of the mayor, in making this sound like a done
deal, putting his cart way out ahead of the horse,'' he said,
adding that Brooklyn residents may file suit to block the project
because of what he called ``shoddy and inaccurate'' information
contained in an environmental review of the property by the Postal
Service.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's announcement came after a succession of meetings
among the developers, neighborhood representatives and elected
officials earlier this week at the behest of Nydia Velasquez, the
Brooklyn congresswoman. Ms. Velasquez said she had persuaded the
Postal Service to postpone signing a lease on the property until
discussions took place involving Meskin, DiBrienza and other
neighborhood representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions clearly did not satisfy everyone. DiBrienza said
Thursday that developers had been ``evasive and unresponsive.'' But
Ms. Velasquez said executives of Millennium Partners had ``made it
clear they want to work with the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   In one concession, she said, the developers had agreed to
conduct a traffic study before they begin construction, and had
indicated that they would provide signs, streetlights or other
improvements that would ease congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Jed Marcus, chief executive of Insite, a development company
working with Millennium on the project, said late Thursday that a
99-year lease on the Postal Service property had been finalized.
Under terms of the agreement, the developers will pay $500,000 a
year for the 9.4-acre site, demolish one Postal Service building
that until the early 1990s was used as a vehicle maintenance
garage, and incorporate another Postal Service building on the
site, formerly Brooklyn's main mail sorting center, into their
complex.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn project comes amid a surge of development at
long-derelict sites elsewhere in the city. Just a mile away from
the Gowanus site, developers have transformed the long-abandoned
area above the Atlantic Terminal railway station into a huge
shopping complex, and there are plans for further development of
the site. And at the site of the former Washburn Wire factory in
East Harlem, developers announced in March that they would build a
retail complex, with Home Depot and Costco as major tenants.
</P>
<P>
   The plans for the Gowanus site were announced a week after
Marriott Corp. opened a 367-room hotel in downtown Brooklyn, which
officials hailed as a sign that the borough _ which suffered steep
losses in manufacturing employment extending over decades _ is
bouncing back economically.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an absolutely remarkable investment that will aid in
the resurgence of Brooklyn,'' Giuliani said of the Gowanus project.

L.A.'S EARTHQUAKE RISK COULD BE GREATER THAN WAS BELIEVED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geologists have found evidence that the land on which Los
Angeles rests was rocked by severe earthquakes at least twice in
the last 15,000 years, suggesting that the present risk for the
city may be substantially greater than was believed.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the two ancient quakes was found at a site 11 miles
north of downtown Los Angeles, the scientists reported in the
journal Science, and the shocks were estimated to have ranged in
strength from 7.2 to 7.6 on the Richter scale, sufficient to cause
enormous damage to the city if they should be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the geologists who reached this conclusion, Dr.
Charles Rubin of Central Washington University in Ellensburg,
Wash., said in an interview Thursday that the discovery did not
mean that a severe earthquake was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a geologist, and we don't make predictions,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The study by Rubin and his colleagues at San Diego State
University and William Lettis &AMP; Associates, a Valencia, Calif.,
geosciences company, was sponsored by the National Science
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said his work began with a study of photographs made in
the 1920s before building in the Los Angeles area obliterated the
long, continuous cliffs, or scarps, separating two ground levels,
which are associated with the Sierra Madre fault along the southern
flank of the San Gabriel Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scarps created by slippage of this fault have been mostly
leveled, paved, or built up over the years,'' he said, ``but we
found one surviving scarp in Loma Alta Park in suburban Altadena.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutting through the sediments, the geologists found a faulted
region where adjoining layers of sediment were offset from each
other in two places, as they would be after large earthquakes. By
studying the aftereffects of modern earthquakes, geologists have
determined that the degree of fault slippage is related to the
severity of the quake. From the fact that slippage of the fault was
measured as about 17 feet, Rubin and his associates calculated that
the quakes ranged in severity from 7.2 to 7.6 on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed with the gravel that filled the space between faulted rock
sediments were particles of charcoal from ancient fires. Using a
dating technique that measures the quantity of carbon-14 in the
charcoal, the scientists determined that the age of the quakes was
10,000 years or younger.

TOO LATE FOR BRAWLEY TO TESTIFY, JUDGE RULES
</HEADLINE>
 (js) 
By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ For more than a decade, Tawana Brawley's
advisers refused to let her testify about her allegations that she
was raped by a gang of white men _ both to the grand jury
originally investigating the case and in the defamation lawsuit
against the advisers that followed.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the lawyer for one of the advisers said he wanted
to call Miss Brawley in the damages phase of the defamation case.
But the judge, S. Barrett Hickman of state Supreme Court, refused
to allow it, saying it was too late for Miss Brawley to testify on
the underlying questions of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, the jury has determined the falsity of the
allegation that she was raped'' by the plaintiff, Steven Pagones,
and she cannot testify on that question, Hickman wrote in a letter
to the lawyer, Stephen Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is now hearing evidence only on the amount of damages
to assess against the three advisers, the Rev. Al Sharpton, Alton
Maddox and C. Vernon Mason.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Brawley has never appeared at the trial and was not in
court Thursday. But Jackson, Mason's lawyer, made the surprise
announcement of his desire to call her and of the judge's ruling
barring the request in front of the jury Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The move spurred an immediate battle of interpretations outside
of court, with each side portraying the fight over Miss Brawley's
reported willingness to testify as a measure of the other side's
desire to suppress the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he had not called Miss Brawley during the first
phase of the case because the defense had no legal burden to prove
anything. Now, however, he said, ``it's important for the history
of this case that Tawana participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason said that the decision barring her testimony showed ``she
is being prevented from telling her story.'' The defense supplied
the judge's letter dated Wednesday to reporters, apparently to
prove that the judge had barred them from calling Miss Brawley.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones said the offer to call Miss Brawley was a ``publicity
stunt'' and that the defense could have provided her testimony at
any time since the advisers said more than a decade ago that
Pagones had been part of a group of white men who assaulted her.
</P>
<P>
   William Stanton, Pagones' lawyer, told reporters that the
announcement by Mason's lawyer was ``so he can stand on a soapbox
and say the judge refused to let him call Tawana and you people
will print it.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Brawley is a defendant in the case along with her advisers.
She has never appeared at their trial and was not here Thursday;
Pagones had previously won a judgment against her by default.
Although damages are to be assessed against her by the judge
instead of the jury, Hickman has repeatedly stated that she is
welcome to appear in court if she so desires.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Any such appearance, he said in his letter on Wednesday, would
be as a defendant. He said he knew of no law ``that would justify
or warrant testimony from Miss Brawley on behalf of any
co-defendant'' at this stage of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The new battle over whether Miss Brawley will testify occurred
as the trial returned to the snail's pace that caused the first
phase of the case to last nearly eight months.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers argued that Pagones suffered no damages. To
try to prove the point, Jackson called Pagones to the stand. The
defense lawyers then began questioning him through the day, just as
they did for more than 20 days during the first phase of the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the questioning, they tried to cast doubt on Pagones' claim
that he suffered anxiety and other symptoms as the result of their
assertions. The defense lawyers also suggested that his reputation
was never injured in his community. His testimony is to continue on
Friday.

AT TRIAL, EXPERT DESCRIBES CONSTRUCTION OF PIPE BOMB 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A powerful pipe bomb that prosecutors say two men
planned to explode in the city subway system was studded with large
construction nails that would have increased its potential to kill
or mutilate its victims, a bomb expert testified Thursday at the
men's trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other function the nails serve,'' the expert,
Thomas J. Mohnal of the FBI, told a jury in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn at the trial of the men, Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer, 24, and
Lafi Khalil, 23. Prosecutors contend that the two Palestinian
immigrants had planned to detonate the bomb aboard a subway train
that serves a Jewish neighborhood _ the Borough Park section of
Brooklyn _ because of their hatred of Israel and opposition to the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   By showing that scores of 4-inch-long nails had been made part
of what was already a powerful pipe bomb, the government could make
it harder for Abu Mezer's lawyers to convince the jury of their
main argument.
</P>
<P>
   In their opening statement in the two-week-old trial, the
lawyers did not dispute that Abu Mezer had the bomb in his Brooklyn
apartment when the police raided it last July, but they maintained
that he had not intended to explode the device and inflict death
and destruction. Rather, the lawyers suggested that he had planned
to use the bomb as a prop in a hazy plot to defraud a government
antiterrorism program of reward money.
</P>
<P>
   But in his description of the bomb, Mohnal told the jurors that
``it's clearly an antipersonnel device,'' adding that it was
``built with additional shrapnel _ fragmentation _ designed to
cause injury.'' As he testified, Mohnal pointed to a mock-up of the
bomb that the FBI had built.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers, like the prosecutors in the case, have
repeatedly declined to assess the evidence for reporters or to
comment on how they planned to respond to it in their closing
arguments, expected next week.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Padden, one of Abu Mezer's lawyers, told Judge Reena
Raggi that his client would decide over the weekend whether he
would testify, though Padden also told the judge that he and the
other lawyer for Abu Mezer, Jan Rostal, had concerns about their
client taking the witness stand. Padden did not elaborate on the
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Khalil's lawyer, Bruce McIntyre, exercised his right not to make
an opening statement to the jury. However, Khalil told
investigators after he and Abu Mezer were arrested that he had not
known that the bomb existed. Both Khalil and Abu Mezer are charged
with conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction and threatening
to use a weapon of mass destruction. Khalil is also charged with
immigration fraud and Abu Mezer with possessing the bomb. &QL;

FROM AGASSI AND COURIER, OPENING SALUTES FOR DAVIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Time was when it took a bit of arm-twisting to
persuade Andre Agassi and Jim Courier to shoehorn patriotism, in
the form of Davis Cup duty, into their itineraries. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the veterans handling the singles roles this weekend
in the Davis Cup quarterfinal are ready volunteers, just like the
giddy parcel of overachievers from Belgium across the net from them
in this round, just like the Russian underdogs the Americans
squeaked past, 3-2, in the first round in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everywhere except in the United States, playing in the
Davis Cup is viewed as a privilege and not an imposition. Almost
everywhere except in the United States, the competition is awarded
historic significance on a Grand Slam level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camaraderie is an underrated part of playing tennis, but Davis
Cup, if you use it in the right way for your own personal goals,
can actually add to your career and your season, and all of our
players need to understand that,'' said Tom Gullikson, who is in
his fifth year as the captain of the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson was so appreciative that the 19th-ranked Agassi and
the 48th-ranked Courier understand that Davis Cup participation is
worth their while, that for the first time he made no pretense of
courting the higher-ranked Pete Sampras and Michael Chang for this
round.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's draw ceremony at the glass-domed Arts Garden, even
Pierre Paul De Keghel, the president of the Royal Belgium Tennis
Federation, complimented Gullikson on his choice of personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're delighted and honored to face the famous American Davis
Cup team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Famous, maybe. Available, definitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it gets a little tiring, that recruiting thing,''
said Gullikson, who simply reinstated his Round 1 combination of
Agassi, Courier, Todd Martin and Richey Reneberg for Round 2.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday on the familiar hardcourts at the Indianapolis Tennis
Center, Courier will open the five-match test against Filip Dewulf,
the 43rd-ranked Belgian who reached the French Open semifinals last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Then Agassi, again holding down the top singles spot for the
United States, will take on the 159th-ranked Christophe Van Garsse.
</P>
<P>
   Van Garsse is an unlikely spark plug who came through in the
fifth match of Belgium's upset of France, moving the team back into
the elite 16 nation World Group. And then an upset of the
Netherlands put the team into a Davis Cup quarterfinal for the
first time since 1961.
</P>
<P>
   According to Agassi, the left-handed, stubble-faced Van Garsse
has already proved himself a quintessential Davis Cup competitor.
</P>
<P>
   When Agassi and Courier were No. 1 in the world, they sometimes
shunned this event just the way Sampras, citing tennis overkill,
does now.
</P>
<P>
   But after disheartening early round losses at the French Open
and Wimbledon, both veterans have acknowledged that instead of the
Davis Cup needing them, they need it to help jump-start their
summer hardcourt campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely something that I need now,'' Agassi said.

U.S. DRUG CHIEF VISITS LIBERAL DUTCH PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 7th graf to restore dropped word, Thursday, HE returned
...) 
 (JT)

<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands _ The Netherlands had its jaw tightly set
Thursday for the arrival of Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the outspoken
commander of the American war on drugs. Several days ago the
general prepared for his visit by dealing a few public punches
against the Dutch and their tolerance for narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey is on an eight-day tour of European cities, looking at
how Europeans fight and cope with drugs. That includes the
Netherlands, which more than any other country has painstakingly
developed a division between ``soft'' and ``hard'' drugs. It is
where over the counter one can buy small bags of ``space cake,''
``northern light'' or ``zeropolm,'' all forms of marijuana, and not
go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch policy to disconnect cannabis from the criminal
underground of so-called hard drugs by allowing small quantities of
marijuana to be sold in cafes has earned it the envy of some
countries and the derision of others. McCaffrey has made it clear
that he belongs to the critics.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days he has called the permissive Dutch policy ``an
unmitigated disaster.'' He further said, mistakenly, that the Dutch
murder rate far outstripped that of the United States, and his
office issued a statement that all but scolded the Dutch
government.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials expressed their annoyance publicly. The
foreign minister called in the American ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   The fracas has made the general the talk of the nation, not just
in government offices, but also in the ``soft drug'' bars. One
newspaper headline returned the criticism, saying it was the
general who was ``an unmitigated disaster'' for drug policy.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, he returned to more conventional diplomacy by praising
his hosts and saying that he had gained valuable insights from
meetings with the police, doctors, social workers and policy makers
in several cities. He said he had appreciated the chance to learn
of experiments in treating heroin and cocaine addicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to listen and see what I can borrow,'' the general
said. ``Most important for me is to discover how to use methadone
as a tool to deal with heroin addiction. The Dutch have 20 years of
experience doing that, and we want to watch that carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Programs to treat addicts are more thorough in the Netherlands
than in the United States, McCaffrey said. And Dutch treatment
projects ``also have a much higher rate of contact with addicts
than we have,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey visited a pilot project in Rotterdam where heroin
addicts in a supervised center receive free heroin in an effort to
reduce drug-related crimes and reduce their exposure to HIV. But
the general clearly disapproved of such projects, which are also
under way in other European countries, including Switzerland and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Supplying heroin may reduce crimes and AIDS rates, he said, but
the users remain addicts, marginalized from society and, perhaps,
discouraged from joining methadone programs.
</P>
<P>
   The general did not visit any of the 800 or so cafes that the
country licenses to sell marijuana and hashish in small quantities
for private use. An aide said he was convinced that they were
dangerous for young people, because they made drug use seem normal.
Besides, the aide said, the general would not want to glamorize
such places.

QUANCE MAKES ROOM FOR BABY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kristine Quance's immediate future in swimming
hung in the balance of the test result. No way could it come up
positive, the former Granada Hills High standout told herself. When
it did, she felt awful, like she had disappointed everybody who had
helped her become a 1996 Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   Quance did not fail a drug test, like her would-be Goodwill
Games teammate Gary Hall Jr. The 23-year-old newlywed passed a
pregnancy test. As the ostensibly glorious news was delivered to
her, Quance's first reaction was that this was a slip-up far worse
than Hall's.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs, after all, eventually leave one's system without a trace.
But the new life growing inside of her was going to change her body
for the next nine months and her life forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really upset at first,'' Quance, who was married in
April, said Thursday. ``I was thinking, what have I done to my
swimming (career)? This is something that's supposed to be great,
but I felt like it was bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Quance can see that her thinking was all wet.
She and her husband, Jeff Julian, himself a former world-class
swimmer, have come to view impending parenthood for what it is: one
of life's most precious gifts.
</P>
<P>
   As for swimming, well, it always has been a most demanding
suitor, taking everything from Quance, including, at times, her
self-image. It can wear on you, second-guessing your place in the
world just because you can't break 4:40 in the 400-meter individual
medley. Forced to take stock of her priorities, Quance realized
that, as much as she'd like to be remembered as a world-record
holder, being a mother was a magnificent achievement in and of
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that family's the most important thing,''
Quance said. ``Jeff and I always said we were going to have kids,
but after I was done swimming. So when I found out I was pregnant,
I had such mixed emotions. Sometimes I feel terrible that I had
such selfish reasons to be upset about it. I mean, swimming is
important, but it's not my whole life. It can't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Quance would be lying if she said there aren't times _
like right now, when some of her friends are fine-tuning their
preparation for the Goodwill Games in New York _ that she doesn't
regard her pregnancy as a real mixed blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Quance was to represent the U.S. in the 200-meter individual
medley in a series of dual meets against squads from China, Germany
and a cosmopolitan team composed of foreign-born collegiate stars.
(The games begin on Sunday; swimming on July 28.)
</P>
<P>
   The former USC star had been looking forward to going
head-to-head against the Chinese ever since she was beaten by two
swimmers from that country in her specialty, the 400 IM, at the
World Championships in Perth, Australia, in January.
</P>
<P>
   She regretfully pulled out of the competition a few weeks ago,
after a full month of nausea and fatigue had run roughshod over her
once-sturdy training regimen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see any more soda crackers or ginger ale,''
Quance cracked before heading off to her daily session in the pool
with fellow members of the Trojan Swim Club.
</P>
<P>
   Quance plans to continue training right up until the day she
delivers, though she has scaled back the intensity of her workouts
after reading all the literature she can find on exercising during
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I'm really worried about is everything I've
read says your heart rate shouldn't get above 140 or 150,'' said
the ultra-competitive Quance, who has been known to get her blood
pumping faster than that in the eighth lap of warmups.
</P>
<P>
   If anybody can round back into world-class form after having a
baby it figures to be Quance. She barely missed qualifying for the
1992 Olympics after contracting mononucleosis right before the U.S.
selection meet.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, she was disqualified from the 400 IM, the
event in which she was a consensus pre-Olympic favorite, in the
prelims of the U.S. trials. And last year, she saw the 400 IM world
record she long has coveted get claimed by a swimmer from China,
where the use of performance-enhancing drugs reportedly is rampant.
</P>
<P>
   Quance has risen to ride out every challenge to this point, and
she's not about to bail out now. Her baby is due in January, which
will give her a little over a year to regain her form before the
U.S. team is selected for the Summer Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Trojan Swim Club coach Mark Schubert already has run down the
list of female athletes who came back from a pregnancy to perform
even better than before, including Quance's 1996 Olympic teammate,
sprint butterfly specialist Crissy Ahmann-Leighton.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Quance is content to live in the moment.
Goodness knows she has spent enough of her life looking a few
months and even four years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last six years I've had a total of two weeks off from
swimming,'' Quance said. ``They say everything happens for the
best, and maybe this was the only thing that would make me take a
break from the sport. Honestly, I probably needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   And honestly? Quance is doing just fine. &QL;

ABL NEEDS WNBA STYLE TV EXPOSURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Television exposure. Just how important is it to college seniors
seeking fame and glory on the women's pro basketball scene in the
United States?
</P>
<P>
   Well, according to the American Basketball League it played a
major role in the rival WNBA snagging the top seniors this year,
which is why it was thrilled to get two championship series games
on CBS the next two seasons, and why it hopes to improve its
overall television package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, television was a big factor in the recruiting battle
this year,'' said Gary Cavalli, ABL CEO and co-founder. ``Some of
the top players who signed with the WNBA sighted television as one
of the main reasons they did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing is believing. And that's what the WNBA presented to
recruits last summer when it got great lead-in exposure from the
NBA playoffs. It broadcasted 34 games, including the playoffs, with
key games targeted for Saturday on NBC, and the others on
widely-recognized ESPN and Lifetime. This year 30 regular season
games can be seen on the same networks, and the expanded playoffs
are expected to be televised, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL, whose nine teams played a 44-game season compared to
the WNBA's 10-team 30-game season, had only 35 games televised in a
six month season, all on Fox Sports Net and BET, which is not
available in some areas. To make matters worse, some of the games
were taped delayed, including a few from the championship series.
Cavalli said he hoped to minimize that problem when he announces
the expanded television package next week.
</P>
<P>
   While TV played a role, it was not necessarily a deciding factor
in some seniors' decisions to play for the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a high priority for the Sparks' Allison Feaster, whose
only television appearance at Harvard was the NCAA first-round game
against Stanford, which was upset by the Crimsom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a factor, but I'm not sure how big it was,'' said
Feaster, the fifth pick in the draft. ``It was important that the
WNBA was really well planned out, the league would be well
publicized so that people will have a chance to watch it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did consider the ABL. I chose the WNBA for other reasons.
The season was a huge factor for me. I wanted to do other things
the eight months that I'm out.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a key issue for Sacramento Monarchs' Ticha Penicherio,
the All-American from Old Dominion and Portugal native who was
picked second in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family and friends are overseas,'' said Penicherio. ``For
me it was the perfect fit, because I can play here and be exposed
in the states and then go back home and have the opportunity to
play. It really depends on what you want as a player.''
</P>
<P>
   But certainly with WNBA games on TV it made it easier for
players to get some insight into the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not just TV, but the whole thing,'' Penicherio said.
``I had the opportunity to follow the WNBA last year and we could
feel through the TV the excitement, the fans, the crowds, how much
fun the fans and the players were having. We have a lot of games on
TV in order to promote players. But that was not the main reason
why I came to the WNBA, but definitely I thought about it. It was
one of the things that made me come.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was so much advertising of it,'' said Sparks forward
Octavia Blue, a second-round pick from Miami. ``I just wanted to
play in a nice arena, get the exposure, the TV exposure. I just
wanted to be a part of it, especially since it's just getting
started.''
</P>
<P>
   Penicherio, who did not decide with which league to sign until
the 11th hour on WNBA draft day, said she saw her old teammate,
Clarisse Machanguana, of the ABL's San Jose Lasers, channel surfing
one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise there's not a lot of marketing of the (ABL) games so
people sometimes are not aware that the games are on TV,''
Penicherio said. ``It's unfortunate because they have really good
games, and good players, and good competition. But sometimes you're
just flipping the channels and say, `Oh my god, the ABL has a game
on,' but you're really not aware of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends
</P>
<P>
   Neilson ratings for the WNBA through five games are 2.0 on NBC,
.74 on ESPN and .52 on Lifetime, not far from last year's overall
average, except for ESPN which was .9 last year. ... As far as
Michael Jordan's involvement in the ABL's new Chicago franchise,
Cavalli said he has not been in contact with the NBA superstar
regarding investing in the team and figured the most Jordan would
probably do is make some appearances at games to support his former
teammate Craig Hodges, a former Long Beach State standout, whose
wife, Allison, is general manager of the expansion team. ... Talks
are ongoing between the ABL and Philadelphia Rage point guard Dawn
Staley, who is rumored to be entertaining the thought of joining
the WNBA. ... Jennifer Gillom was the WNBA Player of the Week after
posting 26 points and 10 rebounds in two victories for the Phoenix
Mercury last week.
</P>

   NEW YORK _ Police officers searching for a missing Upper East
Side socialite said Thursday that they had found evidence of a
forgery operation, but no sign of the missing woman, after a tip
led them to the New Jersey Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   The Carlstadt, N.J., police began searching the area near Giants
Stadium on Tuesday after a local factory worker reported seeing a
couple several weeks ago in a Lincoln that resembled the one used
by the leading suspects in the disappearance of the socialite,
Irene Silverman.
</P>
<P>
   Officers who combed the area with police dogs found about 50
Social Security cards that had apparently been filled out by
someone practicing a signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like somebody was practicing their forgery,'' said
Detective Sgt. Michael Barbire, a spokesman for the Carlstadt
police.
</P>
<P>
   New York City police officers searched the area on Wednesday
night and Thursday, using police dogs and scuba divers to search
through a creek. No signs of Mrs. Silverman were found, Barbire
said.
</P>
<P>
   The factory worker recalled seeing an odd-looking couple in a
green Lincoln there on July 1, several days before Mrs. Silverman
disappeared. The worker, who was not identified, told police that
he saw a woman sitting in the car and then watched in surprise as a
man emerged from some nearby reeds, got in and drove off.
</P>
<P>
   The worker then went on vacation. When he returned last
Saturday, he read news accounts of the case and learned that the
leading suspects, Kenneth Kimes and his mother, Sante Kimes, drove
a green Lincoln. He called the local police, and they began the
search.
</P>
<P>
   Barbire said that the name Silverman was not found on the Social
Security cards. Investigators said the results of DNA tests on hair
and saliva found in the Kimeses' car had not been received
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate development, lawyers for the Kimeses announced
that they would ask a judge Friday to free both of their clients on
bail. Mel Sachs, a defense lawyer who is now representing Kimes,
said he and Mrs. Kimes' lawyer were appealing a decision by a
Manhattan judge last week to hold them without bail until Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prosecution will have to give a basis for holding him,''
Sachs said. ``What proof is there that he should be held?''
</P>
<P>
   Sachs said the police investigation into Mrs. Silverman's
disappearance had so far produced no evidence linking Kimes to the
missing millionaire's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   But an official in the Manhattan District Attorney's office said
investigators had significant evidence linking the Kimeses to Mrs.
Silverman.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have not made a decision about charging the two
because they can be held for up to 90 days in New York before they
must be extradited to Utah, where they are charged with writing a
bad check.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of a charge at this point is not a comment at all on
the evidence,'' the official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``At the appropriate time, we will size up what we
have.''

COMMENTARY: DISTURBING THE PEACE TO KEEP IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a stir last week when the Police Department
said that its officers would soon load their 9-millimeter Glocks
with new ammunition, replacing full-metal-jacket bullets with
hollow-point bullets.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you unfamiliar with such matters, the
full-metal-jacket types have a way of passing through their
intended targets and striking what are customarily, and
meaninglessly, referred to as innocent bystanders. (The
``Seinfeld'' finale aside, how many guilty bystanders have you
heard of?)
</P>
<P>
   Hollow points flatten on impact and expand. Once they hit
something, they usually stop right there. The down side is that
they cause nasty internal wounds, which means that a stray bullet
may wreak unintended havoc. So it would be nice to have officers
who shoot straight.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Dolensek and a few of her City Island neighbors were
pondering that the other day as they sat on her veranda overlooking
Eastchester Bay in the northeastern Bronx. From across the water
came a steady and familiar rat-a-tat-tat, endless volleys from the
police firing range on Rodman's Neck in Pelham Bay Park.
</P>
<P>
   Noise has been a constant companion on City Island for nearly 40
years, which is how long police have used Rodman's Neck for target
practice and for detonating fireworks and an occasional
window-shattering bomb.
</P>
<P>
   But as Ms. Dolensek thought about the new ammunition, it
occurred to her that the racket may get even worse.
</P>
<P>
   While police say they plan no changes in their training program,
she wondered whether that would ultimately prove to be the case,
given the heavy premium that hollow points place on accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   More test firing would, of course, produce yet more noise. And
that, Ms. Dolensek said with a slight roll of the eyes, would mean
more irritation for City Island's 4,500 residents, who in a sense
are the Greta Garbo of New York. They just want to be left alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm asking for is some peace,'' said Susan Strazzera, one
of the neighbors. When a visitor agreed that it was rather noisy,
Ms. Strazzera said: ``This is nothing. Some days it sounds like
Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, islanders pleaded with the Police Department to
soundproof the range and to remove tons of spent lead that was
believed to be polluting water and land. Police did clean up the
area. Noise remains an issue, however, and it is enough to make
some on the island go, if you will, ballistic.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone feels that way. ``You get immune to it,'' a
teen-age girl said at a local deli. But others are ready to move
out, especially when the crackle of gunfire jolts them awake in the
morning or mars their evening as it continues well after dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days there's no noise at all, and then suddenly at 5 p.m.
it starts going like gangbusters,'' Ms. Dolensek said. Just about
as maddening are loudspeakers at the range that blast instructors'
directions clear across the water. ``You can hear every word,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department promises relief in the form of a $2.8
million plan to soundproof the range and install a ventilation and
filtration system for the lead powder produced by millions of
bullets. Inspector John Colgan, commander of the department's
office of management and budget, said that a contractor should be
chosen by the end of October, and construction completed a year
later. A result, he predicted, will be ``a substantial reduction in
the sound impact.''
</P>
<P>
   City Islanders have come to take a ``we'll believe it when we
see it'' attitude. Not that they are police haters. Quite the
opposite. It is a blue-collar area that voted 4-1 for Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani last November.
</P>
<P>
   But people there have heard pledges of imminent action for five
years, and skepticism has deepened with time. ``This thing has gone
on too long,'' said the islanders' assemblyman, Stephen Kaufman.
``Nobody believes them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This project has become like Penelope's tapestry,'' he added.
``You weave it in the morning and it comes unwoven at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it could be that police mean business this time. And
if the firing range is eliminated as a nuisance, islanders can
train their sights on a new target: planes that roar directly
overhead on their way into La Guardia Airport. Wednesday afternoon,
the noise was almost unbearable as jets flew by every minute or
two.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it paid to think positively. While the planes were
screaming, you couldn't hear the gunfire.

   Boycotting players' &QL; 
principles skewed
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PARIS _ All expenses paid, they could have spent a week in one of
the world's most luxurious hotels, then visited two of the world's
most historic cities, both cradles of a civilization that has
evolved to the point where tall twentysomethings can be
jillionaires and still find a way to feel put upon.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Garnett and his buddies should be basking, and basketing,
in the Cte d'Azur sunshine today, ordering $20 hamburger combos
from room service at the Loews Monte Carlo and dropping a little
jingle across the street in the Hotel de Paris' belle epoque
casino, Prince Ranier's personal ATM.
</P>
<P>
   Those so inclined could spend their mornings golfing in the
foothills of the Alps at the Monte Carlo Country Club, or ogling
the bethonged, detopped lassies at the plage. Next stops: Rome and
Athens.
</P>
<P>
   All in the name of red-white-and-blue patriotism, too. In
return, the only thing being asked of them was to bring home a gold
medal. In basketball. Our sport.
</P>
<P>
   But no. This is about principle. This is about standing up to
the greed and oppression of the fat-cat owners, who have the nerve
to ask them _ 400 in number _ to find a way to make ends meet on a
mere $1.2 billion a year, or $3 million on average.
</P>
<P>
   Impossible!
</P>
<P>
   Misguided protest
</P>
<P>
   The World Championship of Basketball, which starts July 29 in
the shadow of the Acropolis, should have nothing to do with the
labor unrest in the NBA. USA Basketball, as opposed to David
Stern's circle, gleans the profits from the competition _ not that
it would have been much of one if the players who were supposed to
represent us had deigned to put their self-righteous posturing on
hold.
</P>
<P>
   But when the NBA locked the players out, that was that.
Apparently, some bucks might have accidentally trickled back
through the international monetary system into the owners' pockets,
and the players weren't going to stand for that.
</P>
<P>
   Hell no, they said. They wouldn't go.
</P>
<P>
   Our soccer program might be a farce, as it showed in the World
Cup, but our elite hoopsters still reside on a planet of their own.
Unfortunately, the guys who will wear the U.S. uniforms in Greece
are a hodgepodge collection of wannabe and never-will-be subs.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they probably won't even reach the medal round, but
Rudy Tomjanovich diligently drives them. Rocket Rudy T is caught in
the middle _ but, by all accounts, he's enjoying himself anyway _
and could be well-served to suit himself up.
</P>
<P>
   It's a disgraceful situation, one the other countries will find
difficult to fathom. As screwed up as soccer is, beset by arrogant,
injury-faking players, heavy-handed FIFA officials and
double-dealing club owners, et al., when the time comes to don the
national colors for the Coupe du Monde, everyone shows up with
bells on to play ball. To not do so for any reason would be
unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Bizarre stories have surfaced that Ronaldo, Brazil's young
superstar, took the field for the final against France after having
suffered a possibly nerves-induced seizure hours before the match.
Of course, others have claimed Nike, Brazil's benevolent
haberdasher, demanded it of him, but the company's denials have
been adamant.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't matter. Fact is, he played. As the highest-paid
performer in his sport, Ronaldo makes in salary ``only'' $3 million
annually, or about one-seventh what the also 21-year-old Garnett
receives from the Minnesota Timberwolves. Which would seem to imply
life is, or was, pretty darn sweet in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Only hurting themselves
</P>
<P>
   Too darn, the owners concluded, hence their demand to repeal the
Larry Bird exemption, the (Santa) clause that allows teams to
re-sign their own free agents at any sky's-the-limit price without
violating the softest salary cap in history. The players, wonder of
wonders, won't hear of it, so there they all sit, threatening to
wring the neck of another league's golden goose.
</P>
<P>
   One ex-player from an NBA era _ the 1970s _ that wasn't much fun
says: ``When I broke in, we were a league with a bad image problem
because of drugs and we didn't have a labor contract. Looks like
history is repeating itself.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said that well before Allen Iverson's new Benz turned up
in the middle of a drug bust. Guess Iverson is such a busy man this
summer, he can't even keep track of a $100,000 automobile that's
barely off the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, things will get sorted out eventually _ the owners have
budgeted their war chests by unconscionably insisting you
season-ticket holders fork over all your dough up front, as of
Wednesday _ but in the interim, one more U.S. sports team figures
to get spanked on the international stage.
</P>
<P>
   In basketball. Our sport.

PRIMESTAR'S NAME GOES ON TMS NASCAR WINSTON CUP RACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas Motor Speedway executive Eddie Gossage
said the second Texas 500 Winston Cup race last April was run
without a title sponsor because the interested companies ``weren't
exactly what we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage and TMS have finally found a company whose name they
want to hang on next year's NASCAR race: Primestar, the television
satellite service company.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, the Denver-based company will sponsor
the race, to be renamed the Primestar 500.
</P>
<P>
   Speedway officials aren't expected to announce the deal
officially until Wednesday. Gossage was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Primestar executives expressed excitement over the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of money, but it's worth every dollar,'' said Denny
Wilkinson, senior vice president of marketing and programming for
Primestar Inc. ``This deal really works for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Primestar for the past two years has sponsored the Primestar
500, a Winston Cup race in the spring at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Next year, that race will be sponsored by the Cracker Barrel
restaurant chain.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Atlanta track and the Fort Worth track are owned by
Bruton Smith's Speedway Motor Sports, and the Texas-Primestar
relationship developed because of that connection.
</P>
<P>
   Cracker Barrel fit better as a race sponsor in Atlanta because
of its strong marketing presence in the Southeast region of the
country, while Primestar, launched in 1994 as America's first
digital TV entertainment service, made more sense for Texas, where
it has a strong customer base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta was tremendously successful for us,'' Wilkinson said.
``But this is a bigger market and a bigger venue for us.'' What's
more, he added, Primestar's biggest retail distributor is Fort
Worth-based Radio Shack. That allows the company to take advantage
of corporate client hospitality and other opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson would not discuss the cost of the sponsorship,
although executives at Interstate Batteries, which backed the
inaugural Texas 500 race in 1996, said they paid more than $1
million that year. Other Winston Cup race title sponsorships
typically cost $2 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Primestar considers its race sponsorship at TMS a
bargain. Wilkinson cited the advertising benefits and name exposure
from network TV coverage and advertising signage at the speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pays for itself,'' Wilkinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Primestar's involvement in NASCAR goes beyond race sponsorship.
The company also is title sponsor of the No. 16 Roush Racing Ford,
driven by Ted Musgrave.

COWBOYS BEGIN PRACTICE LOOKING TO FILL POSITIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Cowboys safety George Teague knows
position battles all too well. For the past three seasons, they
have been the story of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Teague was traded first from Green Bay to Atlanta and then to
the Cowboys in 1996. He signed with Miami last year and came back
to the Cowboys this year.
</P>
<P>
   All the moves were for the same reason _ either to compete for a
starting position or because he had been replaced as the starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be the same thing for me the past couple of
years,'' said Teague, one of four players trying to replace Brock
Marion at free safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got to come in and compete and try to win the
position.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a mantra spouted by a host of Cowboys as the team began
practicing yesterday at Midwestern State University. Six starting
jobs _ strong-side and weakside defensive end, safety, middle
linebacker, strong-side linebacker and the second wide receiver _
are up from grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys defensive coordinator Dave Campo, whose defense could
have four new starters when the Cowboys open the season against
Arizona on Sept. 6, blamed part of the shuffling on free agency. He
said position changes are something the Cowboys have grown used to.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next four weeks, Campo said he's looking to find
players who will distinguish themselves from the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good mix at all the positions,'' Campo said.
``Whoever comes to the top is going to play. To be honest, I like
that. I like competition. I like young guys and the hunger of young
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   At free safety, Teague, a six-year veteran, will battle a group
of young players _ Omar Stoutmire and Kenny Wheaton, who are in
their second seasons, and Charlie Williams, who is in his third.
</P>
<P>
   Stoutmire is considered Teague's primary competition because of
his speed and athleticism. He runs the 40-yard dash in 4.3 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely is going to be a battle,'' Stoutmire said. ``I
feel anyone of us can do the job. I'm just going to go in there and
prove that I am the best man.''
</P>
<P>
   Teague, who started for the Cowboys two seasons ago when Marion
was injured, believes that his experience gives him an edge.
</P>
<P>
   The contestants for the second receiver position opposite
Michael Irvin are Macey Brooks, in his second year; Stepfret
Williams, in his third year; Billy Davis, in his fourth season;
former TCU receiver Jimmy Oliver, also in his fourth year, but two
previous seasons were spent on injured reserve; and Ernie Mills, in
his eighth year.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Cowboys will use multiple-receiver sets, receivers
coach Dwain Painter said it is not as imperative to find one
starter as it is find a group of guys who can contribute
frequently, with one player stepping to the forefront as a player
the team can count on in any situation.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who got a $1 million signing bonus from Cowboys owner
Jerry Jones a few months ago, has the inside track. However, he
will be pushed by the 6-foot-5, 220-pound Brooks, who has big-play
potential.
</P>
<P>
   Mills played under Cowboys head coach Chan Gailey in Pittsburgh
two years ago. He has finally recovered from a 1996 knee injury and
could work his way into the starting role.
</P>
<P>
   First-round draft pick Greg Ellis and third-year veteran Kavika
Pittman are the starters at defensive end, for now.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys believe that Ellis has the potential to be great
pass rusher in the NFL, and they think Pittman, considered a bust
his first two years, will finally develop with some playing time.
</P>
<P>
   However, because they have just one career sack between them,
questions remain. Fifth-year veteran Hurvin McCormack will get a
chance to compete for playing time, and if the Cowboys are not
pleased with the progress at defensive end by the end of training
camp, look for them to scan the waiver wire for veteran help.
</P>
<P>
   Campo said it could turn out to be defensive ends by committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to shake down to our two best guys who going to be
the starters,'' Campo said. ``Everybody else will be in the
rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing scenario is at linebacker, where 11-year
veteran Fred Strickland's status could have a domino effect.
Strickland, who has admitted to having a subpar season last year,
faces a challenge from Randall Godfrey, 1997's starting strong-side
linebacker, for the middle linebacker spot.
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey, a two-year veteran, is considered the team's middle
linebacker of the future and will get a chance to make the move
this season if Strickland repeats last season's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Making the process more complex is the fact the Cowboys must
find someone capable to replace Godfrey on the outside _ probably
either Broderick Thomas or rookie Darren Hambrick.
</P>
<P>
   Campo said the best three will play. Strickland, who said he is
in better condition than last season, said he's not ready to go
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can do the job better than me, fine,'' Strickland said.
``I'm not going to give it up that easy.''

   NEW YORK _ The way you spot HBO boxing executive Lou DiBella at
a boxing event is by his beaming face, which, as Lou DiBella is 6
feet 3 inches, shines as a beacon above the crowd. There is also
the single gold earring in the shape of a boxing glove. You don't
see many Harvard Law graduates who sport glove earrings or who can
relate, as does the sweet-tempered DiBella, to a fellow who speaks
movingly of his fighting cocks (the light-heavyweight champion Roy
Jones Jr., fighting Saturday at Madison Square Garden on HBO).
</P>
<P>
   How does a Harvard guy connect with a guy who can speak at
length about a dead chicken?
</P>
<P>
   An aggrieved look from the normally affable DiBella, who may
just be the most influential man in boxing and, when speaking with
the boxing press, the most outspoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a Greenwich, Conn., kid,'' DiBella says. ``I'm a kid
from Brooklyn. I was raised in Flatbush by Italian immigrant
grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Ivy League education gave me the education to deal with the
Don Kings or Bob Arums of the world,'' he says, referring to the
prominent promoters, ``who are brilliant and Machiavellian, but
your average fighter is not a country club kid, socioeconomically.
They've struggled. I don't want to bare my soul totally, but I can
relate to it.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes for power in boxing? Working at HBO, which spends
more than any other network (reportedly $50 million this year) and
thus rules the roost. And HBO has exclusive contracts with Jones,
Oscar De La Hoya, Prince Naseem Hamed, who does a back flip into
the ring, and world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   As programming chief for HBO boxing, DiBella, working under the
president of Time Warner Sports, Seth Abraham, has the power to
help determine what matches the audience will see.
</P>
<P>
   Why does Abraham give DiBella this kind of freedom?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he's Lou,'' Abraham says. ``Fights are made by
spontaneous combustion. You have to breathe it. Lou breathes it.
His skill goes far beyond matchmaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham tells the story of how HBO acquired Prince Naseem Hamed.
``Lou didn't discover Hamed,'' Abraham begins. ``The other guys
discovered him.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``other guys'' would be Showtime? ``Yeah,'' Abraham says.
``What Lou did was craft a plan to walk Naseem from those people to
HBO, including opening him in America, in Madison Square Garden.
Lou made a match with Kevin Kelley, the Flushing Flash, a local
hero, against this foreign interloper. It was a terrific fight with
seven knockdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is also a tremendous publicity machine in our company
which Lou presents to a man like Hamed. We got a fashion
photographer to shoot Hamed in such a way that his arms and gloves
looked larger than the rest of his body. Then the piece de
resistance, we set his gloves on fire. We called it `Fists of
Fire.' Talent relations are also important. Boxers are divas in
short pants; they get mad, they need to talk to somebody. They feel
comfortable with Lou.''
</P>
<P>
   Lou DiBella has an old mug shot of Don King on his office door.
There is history between HBO and Don King. King decamped from HBO
years ago with Mike Tyson, boxing's biggest draw. HBO has been
trying _ unsuccessfully _ to put together a match between one of
its fighters, Lewis, and Evander Holyfield, who is also a world
heavyweight champion and who is promoted by King.
</P>
<P>
   What are DiBella's feelings about King? DiBella's answer befits
a man who really wants to make the Lewis-Holyfield match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing against Don personally,'' DiBella says. ``I
don't like some of the ways he conducted business, but I don't view
him as the source of all evil. I don't want this to become a Don
King story. The system is corrupt; he's just better at using it.
The ratings organizations and their shenanigans, the misuse of
options contracts by promoters. If the desire is to fix boxing, you
have to fix the whole system.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He sees boxers, on the other hand, as on the side of the angels.
``It's a sport that's never boring,'' DiBella says. ``It's imbued
with tremendous poetry, and irony and comedy, full of characters
who if you didn't know, you couldn't invent them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighters to me are the noblest and most decent of men. To be a
professional fighter, you can go from the top to the bottom, the
bottom to the top in 10 seconds. There are a lot of allegories for
life. Evander Holyfield was supposed to be too small, too old. He
was supposed to get into the ring with Tyson and lose, and instead
what you saw was the better athlete and more committed person win,
and that's the beauty of boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Did DiBella ever hit anybody?
</P>
<P>
   A somewhat nervous laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, generally in self-defense. I'm not a bully by nature,
but as a kid I got bullied a little bit. I was like the smart kid
in class and I was small.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter the hero, Muhammad Ali. DiBella listened to him on his
transistor radio, late at night, in bed; grew up, went into boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not literally a fighter,'' DiBella says, ``but
figuratively I'm a fighter. ''
</P>
<P>
   He had parents he admired, he was able to go to college, his
life doesn't look like an obstacle course. ``Some fights are very
personal,'' he said. ``I don't want to get into it all, but I've
lost three of my closest friends. I lost my brother six years ago.
You have to live life. You have to go for it.''

THE SPOTLIGHT BRINGS SMILES FOR NOVOTNA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAHWAH, N.J. _ Jana Novotna, still getting used to the
expectations that come with being Wimbledon champion, seemed as
stunned as the sellout crowd at the A&AMP;P Tennis Classic Thursday
night when she failed to hold serve and squandered an opportunity
to put away her match against Mariaan de Swardt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Novotna slumped in her seat and stared into space until prompted
to return to the court. Perhaps contemplating how tired she must
have been after consecutive victories at Eastbourne, Wimbledon and
the Czech Open, and realizing she was on the verge of an extra set,
Novotna stepped onto the court and put the match away, ending the
playfulness that marked most of the match. With the 6-3, 6-4
victory in hand, she spun a pirouette and broke into a huge smile
as she approached the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an enormous difference,'' Novotna said afterward of her
new-found fame. ``Not only here, but everywhere, not only on the
tennis side, but on the streets, I've never had so much publicity,
so many people coming up to me and just being very happy for me. I
think it's so much more than just saying, `Oh, well done.' It comes
from the heart.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Novotna was an afterthought for this tournament not long ago,
being recruited as insurance in case Anna Kournikova could not play
because of torn ligaments in her right thumb. Now Novotna is the
star, and that became even more important for this exhibition
tournament when Kournikova bowed out Wednesday and another player,
Mirjana Lucic, canceled Thursday because of illness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   De Swardt stepped in for Kournikova, flying up from her home in
Hilton Head, S.C., to fill the eight-player card. And playing the
understudy to Novotna was no problem. ``I don't think there was one
player not happy for her,'' De Swardt said. `` She's a good
athlete, a good competitor.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   De Swardt was echoing the sentiments of many players, who, like
many tennis fans, were relieved to see the 29-year-old Novotna
finally capture a Grand Slam. The No. 2-ranked Novotna, meanwhile,
continues to be astounded by the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you think about those things,'' said Novotna,
who will face Amanda Coetzer in the semifinals on Saturday. ``You
just go out there and try to do your job. I've dreamed about
winning a Grand Slam tournament for a long time, but that's it. You
don't think about what happens afterward.'' &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kournikova was also on hand Thursday night, and while a swollen
right thumb kept her from playing in the tournament, it did not
stop her from drawing a crowd. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova, whose entourage here included Detroit Red Wings star
Sergei Fedorov, answered questions from fans, hit balls into the
crowd and autographed items of clothing for a charity auction
before Thursday night's match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have to do it for the fans,'' the 17-year-old
Kournikova said. ``I really tried to play. I wanted to come for the
fans, for the tournament, because I'm really disappointed I
couldn't play.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 16th-ranked Kournikova tore ligaments in her right thumb
before Wimbledon, but accepted the invitation to play here thinking
that she would be sufficiently recovered. But when she tried to
practice on Wednesday, the thumb swelled again and her doctors
advised her to withdraw.

MORE AMERICANS THAN EVER READY TO BUY HOMES, SURVEY FINDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Reflecting a housing boom well under way locally,
a national survey just released indicates more Americans than ever
want to buy a home and believe they have the means to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Among renters, six in 10 said buying a house was a top priority,
according to the 1998 Fannie Mae National Housing Survey. And
thanks to a booming economy, hurdles cited in the past such as lack
of money, weak job confidence and social barriers have fallen to
their lowest levels this decade, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   The Fannie Mae study is used by the government-mandated lender
to track demographic and geographic trends among current and
would-be home buyers. The publicly held Fannie Mae was created by
Congress in 1938 and is the largest source of mortgage financing in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   While personally optimistic, potential home buyers are less
convinced that the market is poised in their favor, the survey
found, with just 65 percent saying this is a ``somewhat to very
good time to buy a home,'' down from highs in 1993 and 1994, when
72 percent and 76 percent thought so.
</P>
<P>
   But 58 percent of renters said they are ``somewhat confident or
totally confident'' they would qualify for a mortgage if they
applied today, up from 52 percent when the question was last asked
on the survey in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Low interest rates and a strong economy are making Americans
more confident that home ownership is within reach for them,''
Fannie Mae Chief Executive James Johnson said in a statement. Those
conditions also make potential buyers ``less likely to believe that
obstacles stand in their way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of enthusiasm nationally is being seen locally as
well. In the first sign of a broad-based recovery in the local
housing market this decade, single-family home sales soared in June
because homes in all price ranges are moving swiftly, the Southland
Regional Association of Realtors reported earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an awful lot of people trying to get into the
marketplace and frankly not enough listings,'' said Bud Mauro,
president of the organization, which represents Realtors in the
suburban San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said that within the Greater Los Angeles market, the San
Fernando Valley is particularly well-situated to benefit from buyer
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to other parts of L.A., we have the best prices . . .
and newer homes,'' Mauro said. ``If the Valley is an option for a
buyer, they're probably going to buy here.''
</P>
<P>
   The new survey's other major conclusion was that aging baby
boomers facing empty nests when their children move away will
create a wave of home sales and new financing to take advantage of
the equity they have accumulated in their houses.
</P>
<P>
   Better than seven in 10 adults ages 40 to 54 say they are or
will be empty-nesters within the next decade. About one-third say
they plan to sell their homes and buy new ones, the survey found --
a phenomenon that should create a new liquidity in the housing
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that one-third of a demographic group as large as
baby boomers intends to sell the homes they're in today and move
into other homes has enormous implications for the the real estate
and mortgage finance industries,'' said Fannie Mae spokesman John
Buckley. Even with just one-third planning to sell, he added,
``that is a lot of homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who said they plan to buy a new home, 38 percent
said they will buy one of comparable value, 29 percent will trade
up, and 32 percent plan to buy a home of lesser value.
</P>
<P>
   The 53 percent of baby boomers who plan to stay put represents
dynamic change for the housing and mortgage industries, Fannie Mae
officials said. For example, 45 percent of baby boomers said they
found reverse mortgages either ``somewhat or very appealing,''
portending significant growth for reverse mortgage lending in the
decades ahead.

DEAF MEXICANS TALK ABOUT LIVING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MIRTA OJITO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first time he was handed a backpack full of
pencils and ordered to sell them for $1 each in the subways of New
York, Jesus Barraza understood he had been lied to.
</P>
<P>
   Barraza, deaf and illiterate, had come to the United States in
1994, enticed by tales of riches from a woman he had known since
childhood in Mazatlan, a city in western Mexico. The woman, Rosa
Maria Beltran-Sanchez, handed him a fake passport and told him that
in New York he would find work as an electrician.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he became a virtual slave of bosses who smuggled dozens
of deaf Mexicans into the United States, putting them to work
selling trinkets in the subways and airports of New York, Chicago,
Boston and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Their story became public a year ago this Sunday when three men
and a woman walked into a police station in Queens and, using signs
and written messages, revealed a tale of abuse and enslavement that
shocked the city and attracted national attention.
</P>
<P>
   Since then they have been kept by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in a motel, the details of their ordeal
revealed only in the formalities of criminal prosecutions. Now,
after 18 of their bosses have pleaded guilty and have been
sentenced or deported to Mexico, the Mexican workers have begun to
tell their stories.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews conducted Thursday with the help of sign-language
interpreters, several of the immigrants described living in crowded
houses, watched by abusive, greedy bosses, who punished them if
they did not make enough money.
</P>
<P>
   Barraza said he turned over as much as $200 to his bosses when
he returned from a 12-hour day in the subways but was never given
money to buy milk or pampers for his 2-year-old son. Ms.
Beltran-Sanchez, who was the boss in the house where Barraza lived,
gave him one diaper a day for his child and allowed him to borrow
milk from her own children, but only if he pleaded.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Barraza would go to the corner bodega to buy diapers
and baby food on credit, he said. He paid off his tab with the tips
he accumulated from subway riders who gave him more than the $1
price of the trinkets. He said he felt the payment for the pencils
belonged to his bosses, who were supposedly saving it for him and
the others to help their relatives in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never steal from anyone,'' he said. ``It was very
obvious that the money was not mine to keep.''
</P>
<P>
   And if he did, he knew there would be consequences. Barraza,
tall and muscular, said that when he dared to ask for food, he was
punched and slapped on the head by Ms. Beltran-Sanchez and once
even threatened with a knife.
</P>
<P>
   He said he put up with the long, miserable hours in the subway
cars, the lies and beatings because he had nowhere to run to and he
feared deportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about leaving a couple of times,'' he said. ``But
where was I going to go? I didn't know anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he stayed for 41 months.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the images haunt him. He said he saw one of the
bosses beat another immigrant repeatedly, until his boyish face had
become a maze of scars. He slept with his wife and son on the top
of a bunk bed and many nights all three went to bed hungry. Often,
too depressed and tired to work, he walked the streets of Queens
waiting for nightfall. On those nights, when he returned and his
bosses realized he had not made any money, he was denied food.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Gonzalez, 26, lived in another house run by a different
set of bosses, who had their own ideas about punishment. When
Gonzalez did not sell enough trinkets, he was sent into a room by
himself and forced to assemble thousands of key chains to be sold
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, there were more horrific moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst,'' he said, ``is when I saw them beat the
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said the bosses, who were deaf themselves, often
slapped crying infants and forced spoonfuls of food into the mouths
of finicky toddlers who did not want to eat.
</P>
<P>
   He said he often thought of going to the police but feared that
his bosses and their friends, here and in Mexico, would eventually
find out and have him killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy that the police came when they did,'' he said
Thursday. ``I never thought they would come. To this day, I don't
know who did it. It may have been one of us, or it may have been a
neighbor. I have no idea who did it, but I'm thankful they did
it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In fact, the people who went to the police were two workers.
</P>
<P>
   One of them said in an interview Thursday that he decided to
seek help because his bosses had started to abuse him mentally as
well as physically. He agreed to tell his story for the first time
on the condition that his name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   He said that last year, after more than three years of hard
work, he thought he deserved a vacation and his bosses had promised
him one. He was told he would be going to Florida in July with
eight co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   But when the time came to pack, his bosses told him that they
had changed their minds and he would not be going. That made him
angry enough to walk into a police station house that same night
and alert the police to what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They broke their promise to me,'' he said, anger still
reflected in his desperate and quick signing. ``They made me work
hard for months, promising that we would all enjoy a vacation and
then they shut me out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The worker said he came to the United States thinking that he
would lead a better life. He had lost his job as a fisherman in
Mexico and, following the advice of friends, took the fake passport
they offered and crossed into the United States. He said the border
patrol officer never asked to see his documents, though.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, accompanied by three of the bosses who had
recruited him, he arrived in New York. Within days, he was taken to
the subway, handed a bag of trinkets and told to begin selling. ``I
was deeply humiliated,'' he said. ``I thought peddling trinkets was
like begging. That's not what I came here for.''
</P>
<P>
   The man and 34 other workers, who still remain in the motel,
have asked for permission to stay in the country; 14 of their
fellow workers voluntarily returned to Mexico earlier this week.
Immigration officials have agreed to sponsor the workers still here
for a special visa granted to witnesses who contribute to the
prosecution of criminal cases. Friday, they will receive work
permits and will soon move to housing provided by the city.
</P>
<P>
   Barraza has already decided what kind of work he would like to
do. He wants to work at a factory putting together television sets
or in a hospital, waxing the floors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Operating that big machine, you know,'' he said with a grin.
``I think I'd like that.''

BRILLIANT DIGITAL SHARES SPARKLE IN 44.4 PERCENT SURGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Brilliant Digital Entertainment Inc. became the
latest beneficiary of Wall Street's infatuation with Internet
stocks as the interactive game producer's stock rose an impressive
44.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Brilliant jumped $1.062 to $3.312 on volume of 1.69
million shares, or 11 times the six-month daily average, after
Thursday's announcement of a test-marketing agreement with the
GeoCities Internet user group.
</P>
<P>
   Brilliant said the trial will help it fine-tune its first major
product launch in October. The company produces animated games like
Gravity Angels and Cyberswine, with hundreds of plot twists
determined by users.
</P>
<P>
   The pact calls for creating a Multipath Movie Reviewers Club
site that will be available to 150,000 GeoCities subscribers during
a six-week test due to launch next week. Participants will first
obtain a ``Digital Projector'' CD-ROM through the GeoCities Web
site, then set up an online account enabling them to buy 30-minute
``Webisodes'' delivered over the Internet for $4.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   Woodland Hills-based Brilliant said the system is designed to
work much like a cable TV subscriber's buying pay-per-view movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test will provide Brilliant with valuable feedback on
members' user habits and preferences, and enable the company to
finalize its marketing plan and said pricing structure for viewer
subscriptions,'' Chairman Mark Dyne said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The stock move is the third time this year that Brilliant shares
have been propelled by a company announcement. On May 28, shares
jumped $1.062 to $3.25 in the wake of Brilliant disclosing it was
working with Intel Corp. and the rock group KISS to create the
first multipath music video.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 20, Brilliant shares were pounded down $2.875 to $3.187
after the company said shipping delays would lead to a $1.45
million loss in its 1997 fourth quarter. Conversely, it reported a
first-quarter loss of $1.27 million on May 14 and saw the shares
edge down 18.75 cents to $2.692.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks such as Lycos, Excite, Yahoo! and Amazon.com
have posted massive gains in recent months even though the industry
is only a few years old and does not conform to typical investment
analysis. Some of the issues have fallen back slightly over the
past week on concerns that the sector may be overpriced.

 &HT;    Dance Review: ``Blues Rooms &AMP; A Brand New People on the
Planet.''
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Imagine what might happen if an African-American
Martha Graham directed an episode of ``Hee Haw,'' and you get an
idea of what goes on in the amazing series of vignettes that is
Dianne McIntyre's ``Blues Rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with musical collaborator Olu Dara, three musicians and
a well-seasoned ensemble of singing-and-dancing cut-ups, McIntyre
has written a prescription for the blues that recalls the
pre-Prozacian Age. Everything from fish fries to front-porch
philosophizing are used with delicious comic flair in the opening
piece of McIntyre's National Black Arts Festival program, which
repeats tonight at the Rialto Center for the Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
   It's a well-crafted bit of dance theater in which seemingly
anything can happen, from the sassy to the sublime. Modern dancers
create friezes of raw physicality. Two strikingly beautiful dancers
in gold batik harem pants furl and unfurl themselves in a scarf
dance. And to great comic effect, a brawling couple finds a cure
for their romantic hangover by employing a pair of dueling
harmonicas.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's McIntyre. Svelte and silver-haired, elegant and
ageless, her movement is unlike anything you've ever seen before.
Skittering and flitting in all directions, she looks like a pile of
straw in a wind-storm _ particularly in Part Two of the evening,
the elegaic ``A Brand New People on the Planet.''
</P>
<P>
   For a dancer who made her name by collaborating with avant-garde
musicians, McIntyre has found a happy, wholesome way of weaving
old-fashioned song and dance skits. In her comedy and choreography,
she reveals herself to be a performer deeply in touch with her
cultural roots.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the evening, because she cannot stop for the
music, it stops for her.

Pitcher returns home; 
club counsels caution
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
It was a sigh of relief few people in the Astros organization were
sure they would breathe.
</P>
<P>
   They feared the worst and hoped for the best, and in the end the
news was good. Billy Wagner, who took a line drive off the left
side of his head late Wednesday night, returned from Phoenix on
Thursday night with relatively minimal damage.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner suffered a concussion and a soft-tissue injury to his
left ear. He left the field on a cart and was rushed to Phoenix's
St. Joseph's Medical Center, where he spent Wednesday night.
Original plans were for Wagner to spend the night at the home of
teammate Doug Henry, who lives in nearby Chandler, Ariz., but
doctors decided to keep Wagner overnight and re-evaluated his
situation Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old lefthanded pitcher underwent a series of
neurological tests, none of which revealed internal damage. He was
released from the hospital Thursday afternoon and returned to his
Pearland home that night.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at St. Joseph's Medical Center recommended Wagner take
one to two weeks off from pitching, but Astros general manager
Gerry Hunsicker wants to have the pitcher examined by team doctors
before making a decision on Wagner's recovery time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we have him looked at by our doctors and we have our
doctors sit down with us and develop a game plan regarding when and
how he comes back, it's pretty premature to say when he'll
return,'' Hunsicker said. ``The big story today is that Billy
Wagner is on the mend and has escaped serious injury.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be at least a few days before it becomes clear whether
Wagner can avoid a trip to the disabled list. Because the Astros
have been carrying one pitcher over the normal number for the past
few weeks, Hunsicker has flexibility in deciding if it's in the
club's best interest to fill Wagner's spot on the roster. It would
not be prudent to disable the pitcher for 15 days if he will be
able to pitch sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, right now everyone is concerned with his
well-being,'' Hunsicker said. ``It would be premature to think DL.
Until we see how Billy feels, and see what our doctors say, it
would be hard to say anything about the DL at this point. I can
tell you one thing: We are going to err on the side of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main concern is for Billy and his well-being, not how soon
we can rush him back to the mound. We need to get through this one
day at a time. We don't know how Billy's body is going to respond,
and we don't know how he's going to feel. He took a traumatic blow.
I don't feel any need to make a reactionary move to disable him. We
plan to go into the weekend series as is.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry, a seven-year veteran with 78 career saves, will assume
the bulk of closing duties in Wagner's absence. Jay Powell, whom
the Astros recently acquired in a trade with the Marlins, also has
closing experience and could help to plug the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very good team, and we'll get through it,''
Hunsicker said. ``It's the same thing as when we had to put Jeff
Bagwell and Mike Hampton on the disabled list. You don't replace
Jeff Bagwell, you don't replace Mike Hampton, and you don't replace
Billy Wagner, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Diamondbacks catcher Kelly Stinnett hit the line drive
that struck Wagner, who had entered the game in the ninth inning
and was trying to secure the Astros' 8-7 lead. Stinnett was the
third batter Wagner faced in the inning. The Astros lost the game
9-8 in 11 innings, but the defeat was the furthest thing from the
minds of Wagner's teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who (cares) about the game?'' right fielder Derek Bell said.
``The game didn't mean anything after seeing what happened to
Billy. This was just another game; our thoughts were with Billy and
his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Wagner is one of the best athletes on the team, he had
no chance to get out of the path of Stinnett's line drive; it's
doubtful anyone could have. The ball, which ricocheted off Wagner's
head and toward the Diamondbacks' dugout on the third-base side of
the diamond, left the pitcher flat on his back and in obvious pain.
</P>
<P>
   He immediately was surrounded by trainers, coaches and players
from both teams. The most encouraging early signs were the fact
Wagner's vital signs were good and he never lost consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got hit right by the ear,'' said Hunsicker, who attended
the game. ``There was some question as to whether or not it was
deflected (by Wagner's glove), but I can tell you _ sitting there
behind home plate _ it was not deflected. It was a direct hit. If
it was deflected, it was just barely, if at all.''

SUPERIOR INDUSTRIES STOCK TAKES POUNDING FROM STRIKE AT GM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The United Auto Workers strike against General
Motors Corp. struck down Superior Industries' second-quarter
earnings by 18 percent, reflecting reduced deliveries to the
world's largest automaker.
</P>
<P>
   The suburban Van Nuys-based maker of cast-aluminum wheels has
idled 200 of 1,000 workers in Van Nuys, stopped production at a
Tennessee facility, significantly reduced operations at its Kansas
plant and cut back work at three plants in Arkansas and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people expected our earnings to be down,'' said Jeff
Ornstein, Superior's chief financial officer. However, ``this does
not affect long-term gains and momentum of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls the GM crisis ``the worst strike in terms of length and
impact,'' affecting not just a few car models but almost shutting
down the automaker.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of Superior's sales come from General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   The GM strike began June 5 and June 11 at two Flint, Mich.,
parts plants and has led to the closing of 26 of 29 GM assembly
plants in North America and the idling of 178,600 workers. The cost
to the automaker: an estimated $1.2 billion and rising by $80
million in lost profits daily, according to Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute behind GM and the UAW union revolves around the
automaker's alleged reneging on promised capital investments, job
security, and health and safety violations, among others.
</P>
<P>
   GM is suing the union, claiming that the strike is illegal. The
union agreed Wednesday to let an independent arbitrator decide
whether the strike is allowed under the GM-UAW contract.
</P>
<P>
   The strike also has hurt dozens of part makers who supply GM's
factories.
</P>
<P>
   Superior is a victim, said Philip Fricke, an analyst at
Prudential Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are events that are not under its control,'' he said.
``At least it has the financial wherewithal to withstand it,''
thanks to a financial report that includes no long-term debt and
$90 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   For the second quarter, Superior reported a net income of $12.3
million, or 44 cents a diluted share, compared with earnings of
$15.1 million (53 cents) a year ago. Revenues were $138.1 million
vs. $142.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Superior missed analysts' earnings estimates of 57 cents a
share, blaming the GM strike for the entire shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   Superior closed at 27.0625 on Thursday, down 0.625.
</P>
<P>
   Once the strike is settled, Ornstein said, earnings and sales
should rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced that it repurchased 181,000 of its
common shares in the second quarter for a total of 337,000 shares
it has bought back under a program authorizing the open-market
acquisition of 2 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Superior supplies aluminum wheels to major automakers such as
GM, Ford, BMW, Volkswagen, Toyota and Nissan. It also makes
automotive accessories.

FINLEY CUTS DEEPLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- The next time pitcher Chuck Finley gets a phone call
from friend Keith Lyons about a golf date, Finley has good reason
to hang up.
</P>
<P>
   Finley and Lyons had a golf date arranged last August, and
before the two could play, Finley broke his wrist in a game against
the Yankees and was lost for the season. The two had another golf
date arranged for this week, but Wednesday night Finley tore a hole
in his right knee during a play at first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird, Finley said. ``I had to call him up and tell him I
can't play. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, however, still has plans to make his next start Tuesday
in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that could stop that is if it gets infected,
Finley said. ``They washed it out for about an hour, picking rocks,
grass and dirt out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Finley and others were surprised at how bad the cut was after he
slid on both knees while trying -- unsuccessfully -- to tag out the
Devil Rays' Randy Winn. It took eight stitches to close the wound,
which Finley said was ``a hole the size of a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wasn't that concerned about it when I did it, Finley
said. ``Until I looked at it and saw it was all the way down to the
bone. I said `This isn't good.'
</P>
<P>
   If Finley is unable to make his next start, Allen Watson would
start in his place.
</P>
<P>
   Trade talk update:
</P>
<P>
   The Reds wanted center fielder Jim Edmonds in exchange for
pitcher Pete Harnisch, but the Angels said no. Now, the Reds might
be willing to trade Harnisch for a package of prospects, as long as
it includes triple-A pitcher Scott Schoeneweis. Schoeneweis, 24, is
6-6 with a 4.65 ERA in 17 starts for Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels reportedly turned down a deal for Royals pitcher Tim
Belcher because the Royals wanted second baseman Justin Baughman.
They also turned down pitcher Willie Blair from the Diamondbacks,
who wanted double-A outfielder Norm Hutchins.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are interested in strengthening their bullpen, and
have targeted the A's Mike Fetters and the Tigers' Todd Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going to single-A Lake Elsinore for a rehab
assignment as was planned, Todd Greene will leave today for
Oklahoma City to join triple-A Vancouver. Greene, who hasn't played
all season because of offseason shoulder surgery, decided to play
for Vancouver so he could face better pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who will play first base and DH, is expected to join the
Angels when they begin their next homestand July 28 against the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Velarde (elbow) will begin a rehab assignment Monday, but
it has not been decided where he'll play.
</P>
<P>
   With a team-leading 64 RBIs going into Thursday's game, first
baseman Cecil Fielder is on pace to finish with 111. And yet the
Angels don't feel he's been at his best. Fielder is hitting just
.242.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such an important part of our lineup, manager Terry
Collins said. ``If we can get him going, he's going to drive in a
lot of runs for us.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a first: Sunday's game between the Angels and Orioles is
tatoo day for kids 12 and under. Actually, they are temporary
tatoos of the Angels' logo. ... Garret Anderson extended his
hitting streak to 14 games Thursday with a second-inning single.
The Angels' longest hitting streak this season is Darin Erstad's 15
games.

CALIFORNIA SPEEDWAY SITTING PRETTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ It was that rarest of brainstorms, an idea
that seemed good at conception and has looked even better with each
passing day.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at the decision to build California Speedway and
bring NASCAR auto racing back to Southern California, Penske Motor
Sports president Greg Penske speaks with equal parts pride and
amazement at the two-mile speedway's accomplishments in its first
season and a half:
</P>
<P>
   Three premier racing events run, three sellout crowds. About
115,000 fans at May's NASCAR Winston Cup race, making it the
best-attended sporting event in California this season. And a
racing public that is clamoring for the track to build more seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely shows that we brought motor racing back at the
right time in the right place to the right market,'' Penske said.
``To have the largest crowd in the state to see a sporting event _
that's pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of fan support, Penske said the track is likely
to build more grandstands next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have permits to go up to 107,000 seats,'' said Penske,
whose track now seats 86,000, with potential for up to 115,000
total in the house. ``But I think next year we'll probably go up to
around 100,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the track's 1999 schedule is not official, Penske figures
it will be nearly identical to 1998's.
</P>
<P>
   A NASCAR Winston Cup date is expected in spring, with the Busch
cars and Craftsman trucks coming in summer and the FedEx CART Indy
cars finishing the season in late October or early November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see much change for next year,'' Penske said.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors earlier this season had Penske moving one of the Winston
Cup dates from the Penske Motor Sports track at Rockingham, N.C.,
to California Speedway, a notion he called false.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, we just put in 27,000 new seats in North Carolina,''
he said. ``We feel that Rockingham is in the heart of NASCAR
country and is a good market.''
</P>
<P>
   Penske would like to get another Winston Cup date for
California, joining 12 other tracks that host two Cup appearances.
And he could doubtless sell it out, too.
</P>
<P>
   But with Florida's Metro Dade race track _ 45 percent owned by
Penske _ apparently in line for a Cup date next year, he can afford
to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the FedEx CART date later this year is moving toward
becoming a sell-out with 96 percent of the infield tickets sold.
And Penske is working on coming up with new concepts for keeping
his race fans happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're only as good as your last race,'' he is fond of saying.
``There is a lot of competition for the entertainment dollar. But
if we keep taking care of people, I don't see any reason why this
(success) should stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi rolling: With rumors abound that driver Alex Zanardi
will return to Formula One racing next season, his competitors on
the FedEx CART tour must secretly be thinking, ``Why wait, Alex.
Why not go now?''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Zanardi was to make such an impetuous move, he might
still win the series title. He has won the last three series races
and has a 59 point lead over runner-up Greg Moore as the tour
prepares to run the Molson Indy race Sunday in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   A Zanardi win would tie the Italian driver with Al Unser Jr. for
the series consecutive win record with four. Unser Jr. did it in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi has finished second in his previous two races in Toronto
in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficial test: With veteran FedEx CART driver Bobby Rahal
retiring after this season, the race is on, so to speak, for the
job driving his Miller Lite racer.
</P>
<P>
   Names rumored to be in the running for Rahal's seat include
Zanardi teammate Jimmy Vasser and Arciero-Wells driver Robby
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   One name not mentioned is that of La Canada product Tom Kendall,
the four-time Trans-Am champion. Kendall said he has talked to
Rahal about the opening but was not offered a chance to test drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was polite, but not particularly encouraging,'' Kendall
said. ``But I'm going to keep after it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall will have an unexpected to chance to make an impression
when the FedEx tour goes to Michigan in a few weeks. In his
part-time role as an ESPN/ABC television race commentator, Kendall
will take Rahal's racer for a couple of laps around the track to
show television fans what it's like. Along the way, Kendall would
like to show Rahal a few things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are going to be some fast laps for TV,'' Kendall said.
``They may not know it, but that's going to be my test.''
</P>
<P>
   Nuts and bolts: Round four of the SCORE off-road series goes off
today, the Fireworks 250 in Barstow. ... Tickets are on sale for
next year's FedEx CART Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. Race date
is April 18. ... The latest in a spate of bad luck has trimmed M.K.
Kanke's NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Tour series lead to just 12
points. Kanke's lead was over 100 points just three races ago. ...
Buddy Lazier and Arie Luyendyk are each poised to become the Indy
Racing League's first $3 million career winner with a win at the
IRL VisionAire 500 July 25. &QL;

 FORMER VICTIMS SUPPORT BILL TO AVERT REPEATED CRIMES  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIANNE FLYNN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their stories made headlines across the country. They or their
loved ones were attacked, killed or maimed, often by a criminal
recently released from prison.
</P>
<P>
   It happened to Fred Goldman's son Ron, who was murdered in 1994
alongside Nicole Brown Simpson in the infamous case in which former
football great O.J. Simpson was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   It also happened to Tempe resident Carol Fornoff, whose daughter
Christy Ann was slain 14 years ago, and to California resident Mary
Vincent, who was raped and mutilated in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   These victim advocates lined up Thursday to support a bill
introduced by Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., that aims to prevent
crimes like the ones that shook their families.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would provide a strong financial incentive for states
permanently to lock up murderers, rapists and child molesters on
the chance that they might commit a similar crime once out from
behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Victims'-rights advocates called Salmon's legislation heroic.
Crime-policy critics called it ``stupid electioneering.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent, blotting the tears with a tissue clenched by pincers on
one of her two prosthetic arms, said she spoke for victims
everywhere when she said, ``We will not tolerate violent crime in
our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent survived her rape and mutilation by Laurence Singleton,
who was convicted of murdering a mother of three in Florida after
attacking her. He cut off both of Vincent's forearms and left her
for dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn to live with it, but you don't get over it,'' said
Fornoff, whose 13-year-old daughter, Christy Ann, was murdered by a
man with a long criminal record while collecting on her ``Phoenix
Gazette'' paper route.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (these criminals) hadn't gotten their second chances, these
children would not be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon's ``No Second Chances'' bill would require one state to
compensate another for the repeat offense of a murderer, rapist or
child molester released from prison by the first state, even if
that prison release came at the end of a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   It also would change federal sentencing guidelines to make
murder punishable by life in prison or the death penalty and rape
or sexual offenses punishable by life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to draw a line in the sand and say to these monsters:
`You do that, you're out of here. You're done,' '' Salmon said.
``Let's do it without the political fanfare. Let's just get it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   But politics is exactly what Salmon was practicing, said Eric
Lotke, research director of the National Center on Institutions and
Alternatives in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislation is a crock,'' he said. ``This is just stupid
electioneering.''
</P>
<P>
   Lotke said the bill tramples on states' rights by making one
state liable to another, is unnecessary given the low recidivism
rates for murder, and stands little chance of passage.
</P>
<P>
   He labeled those who supported the bill ``professional
victims.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole class of them now. They're angry people. . . .
It's sympathetic, but it's not good policy,'' Lotke said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also has the support of the Fraternal Order of Police,
Childhelp USA and Parents of Murdered Children.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Flynn, constitutional-law professor at Pomona College in
California, said the bill likely would pass a constitutional
challenge. The U.S. Supreme Court has been lenient in allowing
restrictions to be placed on federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   But Flynn said he suspects legislators will balk at the high
cost of building even more prisons to contain those named in the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is ``fiendishly clever'' said Eric Sterling,
president of the liberal Criminal Justice Policy Foundation in
Washington. The bill likely would pass constitutional muster
because it forces a change in state sentencing without mandating
that change.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid liability, states likely would have to impose harsh
sentences for the listed crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon said the bill is designed to get longer stretches for the
nation's most violent felons.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't believe rehabilitation, particularly for pedophiles,
works. And, he said, ``I don't think they deserve a second

CHINESE DISSIDENTS CALL FOR RELEASE OF FIVE ACTIVISTS, GROUP SAYS

   BEIJING - A human rights group based in Hong Kong said Thursday
that 100 Chinese dissidents had called on Chinese leaders to free
five activists who were detained after trying to register an
opposition political party.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter addressed to President Jiang Zemin and Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji, the dissidents expressed outrage that the
authorities have taken 10 people into custody for expressing
political views. The Communist Party bans the formation of
political groups that it has not approved.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the 10 activists have been released in recent days, said
the human rights group, the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China. But five remain in custody in
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call on the central government to rectify the violation of
human rights by the Zhejiang police and to release the five men,''
said the letter, which carries 79 signatures, and claimed the
support of another 21 unidentified sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities frequently detain people they consider
politically suspect, often releasing them after a few days with a
stern warning, but sometimes holding them far longer. Whether any
of the five detainees in Zhejiang will face charges or a prison
sentence remained unclear.

HOUSE APPROVES A MEASURE ON COVERAGE FOR BIRTH CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite the opposition of Republican leaders, the
House Thursday night approved a measure requiring federal health
plans to cover prescription contraceptives, such as birth-control
pills, for federal employees.
</P>
<P>
   And to the distress of the Clinton administration, the House
eliminated money from next year's budget to fix the Year 2000
computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   The votes came as members of both parties, driven by
election-year needs, ransacked one of the 13 spending bills that
the Appropriations Committee had already approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a free-for-all,'' one top Republican aide lamented as
morning slipped into evening and lawmakers postured unchecked by
the normal rules that limit debate.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders had set special rules in an effort to block
discussion of the contraception coverage _ a potentially risky vote
that Republicans wanted to avoid because it could allow abortion
rights advocates to portray them as extreme.
</P>
<P>
   The special rules allowed any lawmaker to throw out any measure
that he or she did not like. House members jumped at the rare
chance to score such easy political points and eliminated more than
50 of the bill's 650 sections.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the House voted 218-203 to approve the overall
bill, which finances the Treasury Department and Postal Service for
the next fiscal year, beginning on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Many members said they expected whatever havoc they wreaked
Thursday to be smoothed over when the House negotiates a final
version of the bill with the Senate in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10-hour chaos that ensued on the House floor, members
also knocked out money set aside to build courthouses in various
cities across the country. And they approved paying $2 million to
gun dealers who had ordered imported firearms that President
Clinton later banned.
</P>
<P>
   The contraception coverage, introduced by Rep. Nita Lowey, D-New
York, and passed by a 224-198 vote, was a rare success for abortion
rights advocates. They hoped it would help counter the negative
publicity that had plagued them since abortion opponents publicized
a late-term procedure they call partial-birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives, led by Rep. Mark Neumann, R-Wis., eliminated the
$2.25 billion that had been set aside to fix federal computers'
Year 2000 bug. Conservatives were worried that House leaders would
not offset the spending and would thus exceed the maximum spending
limits set by last year's balanced-budget agreement.

ABORTION CLINIC ESCAPED STATE SCRUTINY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JODIE SNYDER, HEATHER RATCLIFFE   
 and SUSIE STECKNER   
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The A-Z Women's Health Center, where two women bled to death in
the past three years and a full-term baby was almost aborted last
month, operated free of scrutiny by state health care officials.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, its two sister clinics in the Phoenix area were
checked annually by state investigators for proper equipment and
trained staff.
</P>
<P>
   And legislators who this year pushed for more regulation of
abortion clinics were assured by state licensing officials that
most, if not all, abortion clinics were already regulated.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, of the 14 Valley clinics that advertise abortion
services, only six are licensed by the Department of Health
Services, according to state records.
</P>
<P>
   This disparity in regulation has angered some lawmakers and left
even some state officials confused.
</P>
<P>
   The A-Z center has come under fire because a woman died there in
April when her uterus was punctured during an abortion. Another
patient died in a similar fashion there in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   On June 30, Dr. John Biskind delivered a full-term baby there
that he had started to abort, believing the fetus to be only 23
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A-Z, which advertises itself as the only Arizona clinic willing
to perform riskier late-term abortions, is owned by Dr. Moshe
Hachamovitch, a New York doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Hachamovitch is also listed as the chief executive officer for
two other Phoenix abortion clinics, the Family Planning Institutes
in Phoenix and Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   The A-Z Women's Health Center and most other abortion clinics
are not licensed or regulated by the state because they are
considered private physicians' offices, said Linda Palmer, DHS
deputy assistant director for assurance and licensure services. A
facility is considered a doctors's office when it is owned by one
or more physicians, and the state can regulate them through their
professional licenses, she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; But Palmer conceded Thursday she couldn't say why the two
Family Planning Institutes _ which employ some of the same staff as
A-Z _ were licensed. They have been licensed since 1992, when they
were owned by another physician.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, inspectors have found problems there
ranging from unsterilized equipment to improper paperwork. Neither
clinic was fined or penalized, according to DHS records.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said she was not aware of any licensed abortion clinic
being fined or having its license revoked by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion clinics can volunteer to become licensed by the state,
which is the case with those operated by Planned Parenthood, Palmer
said.
</P>
<P>
   In February, when state legislators were considering tighter
regulation over abortion clinics, Palmer told them that DHS already
was watching over 10 to 12 clinics, according to an article in
``Arizona Capitol Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Contacted Thursday, Palmer first said she didn't remember what
she said in February.
</P>
<P>
   Later she said that the 10-12 figure represents the number of
Planned Parenthood clinics. Not all of those clinics provides
abortion services, though, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Legislative Budget Committee, a key legislative panel,
also assured lawmakers that the abortion clinics already were being
regulated, but based its analysis on data supplied by DHS, said
Jennifer Vermeer, a JLBC analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Now legislators are rethinking the issue of what is a ``clinic''
and what is a ``doctor's office,'' said Doug Cole, spokesman for
House Speaker Jeff Groscost, who was one of the lawmakers seeking
greater regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Several legislators have called Groscost's office asking for a
closer look into what happened at A-Z, Cole said Thursday. Staffers
are looking into more options for more regulation, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Brian McNeil, deputy director of DHS, said Thursday the
department isn't eager to regulate more facilities. However, McNeil
would not comment on whether he felt abortion clinics should be
regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Patients upset with care they receive from the doctors can
complain to the agency that licenses the doctor, usually the
Arizona Board of Medical Examiners, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the medical board, which has been swamped with
complaints, is undergoing its own reorganization. Currently, the
board has more than 1,100 cases being processed. About a quarter of
these have been in the system longer than a year.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the board plans to hold an emergency meeting to
consider whether Biskind's license should be suspended because he
poses an immediate danger to the public, said Eric Nickell, board
ombudsman.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer of DHS said the idea of the state's regulating places
according to the type of procedure being done there is a difficult
one. It becomes even more difficult, she added, when the procedure
is an emotionally charged one such as abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we can come to a common ground very easily on
this,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize something wrong is happening at this clinic, but
under state statute we are doing what we are told. And right now,
the state would have us stay out of it.''
