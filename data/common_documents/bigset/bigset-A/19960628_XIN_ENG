<HEADLINE> Ukraine's President Calls Referendum on Draft Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma
issued a decree Wednesday ordering a referendum for September 25
on the country's first post-Soviet constitution after three months
of fierce debates in parliament, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, Kuchma said the decree, which is backed by the
influential National Security Council, did not rule out the
possibility that the draft constitution might be approved by
parliament before the referendum.
</P>
<P>
"I was forced to take the decision, dictated only by the
interests of the state, to ensure stability and speed up
democratic changes," he was quoted as saying at a military
academy.
</P>
<P>
Under the decree, voters would be asked to approve the
constitution which extends the president's powers and establishes
a two-chamber parliament. It will also restrict the autonomy
granted to Ukraine's pro-Russian Crimean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The text was drafted by a commission in March and adopted by
parliament on the first reading.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, about 140 leftist deputies, who have a
majority in parliament, rejected articles in the constitution
concerning the flag, the Ukrainian language and national emblem as
well as those relating to private property.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over state symbols at the beginning of the second
reading appeared to herald future problems over articles
concerning the economy and executive powers.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of each article of the draft constitution requires
a majority of 300 out of the total of 423 lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine is the only former Soviet republic that has yet to
adopt a post-Soviet constitution.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, U.S. Begin New Round of Military Drills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and the United States
began a new round of joint military exercises today in the
southern desert of the Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The war game, code-named "Infinite Moonlight '96," will be
staged by U.S. Marines and Jordanian Armed Forces. The war game
will end on July 10.
</P>
<P>
It is the second Jordanian-U.S. joint exercises this year. The
first one involved U.S. marines in accordance with a military
cooperation program launched in 1981.
</P>
<P>
About 1,400 U.S. marines out of 4,000, who arrived last Friday
in Aqaba, the southern port city of Jordan, will take part in the
exercises.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. force is part of the 13th Marines Expeditionary Unit,
a component of the U.S. Sixth Fleet.
</P>
<P>
The same number of Jordanian service personnel will participate
in the war game.
</P>
<P>
The event, which take place at Qatraneh, south of Amman, "will
allow U.S. Navy amphibious forces and Jordanian armed forces to
train side-by-side, strengthening the military-to-military
relationship and enhancing coordination and cooperation between
U.S. and Jordanian forces," a Jordanian statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two countries concluded their first joint
exercises at Azraq air base, north of Amman, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two-month-odd exercises, code-named "Eager Tiger," were
staged by U.S. Air Expeditionary Forces and Royal Jordanian Air
Force.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Paddlers Gear Up to Retain Olympic Crowns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, Hebei Province, June 27 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Former
head coach of the Chinese women's table tennis team predicted here
on Thursday that his proteges will retain the two Olympic crowns
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xielin, also chief of China's Olympic table tennis
delegation, said the four Olympic entries of Deng Yaping, Qiao
Hong, Liu Wei and Qiao Yunping, have all maintained their peak
forms technically and morally.
</P>
<P>
"It was out of the question for them to bag the two titles,"
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Deng, an all-time winner who has topped the world rankings for
several years, won the singles title and doubles crown in the 1992
Barcelona Games by pairing with the long-time partner world
second-ranked Qiao Hong.
</P>
<P>
The four veterans have dominated the events since late 1980s
and all hoped to shine again before their imminent retirement
except for Deng.
</P>
<P>
"I will do my best to win honors for my motherland," Deng said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, who lost most matches to teammate Deng, said she hoped to
clear all the obstacles for her teammates in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Zhang admitted that the main foes along the foursome' way to
their glory moments will be those from South Korea and DPR Korea.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Zhang said that special attention must be paid to
those formerly Chinese who play for their adopted countries and
regions, such as Chinese Taipei's Chen Jin, the 1988 Seoul Games
singles champion, He Zhili, now well known as Chire Koyama in her
Japanese name who defeated Deng in 1994 Asian Games, and Canada's
Geng Lijuan, now ranked eighth in the world.
</P>
<P>
Zhang added that even those European players can not be singled
out since they have made rapid progresses over the past few
years.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Says U.N. Chief's Report Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister Alecos
Michaelides has described as "very positive" the recent report by
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to the U.N. Security
Council on his mediation mission in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press before the weekly cabinet meeting today,
the minister said "it is very important that the
U.N. Secretary-General notes that the positions of Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash on issues of sovereignty and political
equality remain at variance with Security Council
resolutions."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Ghali described the present situation in Cyprus
as "unacceptable" and adopted the view that common ground has to
be a precondition for direct talks between the two communities on
the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish-Cypriot community in
the north and the Greek-Cypriot community in the south since 1974
when Turkish troops invaded and seized northern third of the
island following a short-lived coup by some Greek Cypriots seeking
union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary-General stressed in his report that there
should be an overall approach to the Cyprus problem, Michaelides
said, adding that his is a position which the Greek Cypriot side
has supported all along.
</P>
<P>
According to a dispatch by Cyprus News Agency from the United
Nations, Ghali in his report called on the leaders of the Greek
and Turkish Cypriot communities on the island to establish common
ground for the resumption of direct negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Ghali stressed that the "main responsibility" for a Cyprus
settlement rests with the two communities on the island.
</P>
<P>
"A lasting settlement will not be achieved unless the two
leaders can persuade their communities that their interests will
be better served by flexibility and compromise than by continuing
confrontation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said that Greece and Turkey had a "special
responsibility" in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"It is crucial that they should not only lend their active
support to the search for a settlement but should ensure that
their own relations do not develop in a way that endangers that
search," Ghali said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 27 (Xinhua) -- At least three people were
killed and 15 others injured in a bomb blast in a market between
the twin city of Rawalpindi and Islamabad this evening.
</P>
<P>
The bomb explosion razed a small roadside hotel and a number of
kiosks in the crowded market, killing three on the spot, said
police sources.
</P>
<P>
The explosive device went off with a deafening sound,
shattering windows of nearby buildings and destroyed the hotel and
a barber shop.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the device had been planted somewhere in
a narrow alley between the destroyed hotel and the barber shop.
</P>
<P>
They said a few persons had been held up for questioning.
</P>
<P>
During a rescue operation, workers dug for about an hour in the
debris of the hotel to look for the people trapped.
</P>
<P>
Ambulances had carried the dead and the injured to local
hospitals where a couple of the injured were reported to be in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
There was no possibility of any other person lost in the
rubble, however the local administration had brought in a crane
and a tractor to remove the debris, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto expressed deep shock and grief
over the bomb blast in a statement. She condemned in the strongest
terms this bastard act and expressed the resolve that the culprits
involved in the blast shall be arrested and punished.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister reaffirmed that the harder the terrorists
tried to terrorize the people and the government, the harder will
be the government's resolve to deal with them with an iron hand.
</P>
<P>
She directed the provincial authorities to mobilize all their
resources to apprehend the culprits at all costs.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Parliament to Step up Adoption of Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian parliament, the Supreme
Soviet, decided today to speed up the long-delayed endorsement of
a draft constitution.
</P>
<P>
But the deputies did not pass a resolution on the nationwide
referendum proposed Wednesday by President Leonid Kuchma to decide
the fate of the new constitution, as Kuchma had yet to issue a
decree on it.
</P>
<P>
At a closed meeting, deputies agreed that a provisional
parliamentary committee charged with drawing up the new
constitution will discuss Kuchma's opinion on the draft.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to set up sub-committees to discuss disputed
clauses in the draft in order to eliminate differences.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary Speaker Alexsander Moroz told the meeting that he
would not ask deputies to vote on clauses they wanted to put to
the proposed referendum, which Kuchma said might be held this fall.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma told a meeting of leaders of all parliamentary groups
that his decision to hold a referendum had pre-empted
parliamentary approval of the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine, which became independent in late 1991, is the only
former Soviet republic without a national charter. The current,
Soviet-era, constitution has been amended hundreds of times.
</P>
<P>
Parliament has been deadlocked on key points in the
draft. Disputes revolve around the clauses on private property and
state symbols and giving Russian equal status with Ukrainian as an
official language.

CAIRO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Arab information ministers ended
their 29th conference here today, calling on Arab media to
give more support to the Palestinians through exposing Israeli
measures aimed at Judaizing Arab east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference accused Israel of attempting to change
the historical landmarks of the holy city, the Egyptian Middle
East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians regard east Jerusalem as the capital of their
future independent state, but Israel has said that Jerusalem will
remain as its eternal and undivisible capital. Israel captured
east Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The Arab information ministers recommended boosting Arab media
and cultural activities in the Israeli occupied Arab territories
and the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
They called for continuing cooperation between the Arab media
organs and the Palestinian Information Ministry in exposing
Israel's confiscation of land in Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The conference also called for financial support to the
Lebanese Information Ministry so that it can carry out media
campaigns against the Israeli aggression in south Lebanon, MENA
said.

<P>
The information ministers also discussed Arab cooperation and
coordination in the use of satellite channels.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic's trade deficit
has increased sharply, reaching 15.9 billion korunas (590 million
U.S. dollars) last month alone, according to figures released by
the Czech Statistics Department today.
</P>
<P>
Czech imports rose 15.8 percent in the first five months of
this year while exports soared 56 percent. But, compared with the
same period last year, exports from January to May this year grew
only 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the trade deficit will rocket to 165 billion
korunas (6.2 billion dollars) in 1996 if the Czech government
fails to take effective measures to check the rise.
</P>
<P>
The department attributed the higher deficit to such factors
as inadequate capital and backward technology.

ANKARA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Forty-five rebels of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) were killed after the Turkish Armed
Forces staged cross-border military operations in northern Iraq
beginning from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's semi-official Anatolia News Agency today quoted
officials from the General Staff of the Armed Forces as saying
that about a 3,500-strong force staged the cross-border military
operations in northern Iraq and the force has returned to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The agency did not mention the casualty of the Turkish
government troops in the armed clashes with the PKK rebels.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report from the agency today, the
Turkish government troops stayed in the areas of Butine,
Ispindari, Sipa, Edilbi and Meros in northern Iraq and exchanged
fires with the PKK rebels between the area of Ispindari and
Meros.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Turkish security forces entered into 25
kilometers deep into northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 12-year guerrilla war in
southeastern Turkey for self-rule and has been attacking military
and civilian targets in Turkey from northern Iraq. Over 20,000
people including PKK rebels, civilians and government troops have
been killed since the PKK started fighting in August 1984.

international trade, it has huge potential for investment, and
Europe should grasp the opportunity, the EC said in the document,
which will be presented to the European Council and the European
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The document, which listed a number of areas in which the EU
and India could cooperate, said that the priority should be to
eliminate obstacles to trade.
</P>
<P>
The EU is India's largest trading partner, taking 26 percent of
Indian exports and accounting for 30 percent of India's imports.
</P>
<P>
However, India accounts for only 1.3 percent of the EU's
external trade.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Europe invested some 1.3 billion ECU (1.7 billion
dollars) in India, accounting for 18.4 percent of the country's
foreign investment, behind the United States' 22.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the EU and India are currently governed by a
Partnership Cooperation Agreement signed in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Puts Down Forest Fires, Faces Threat of Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia has extinguished all
the fires that raged across its forests and grasslands for nearly
four months, Nature and Environment Minister Zambyn Batjargal said
today.
</P>
<P>
But he also warned that the country should prepare for another
natural disaster -- flooding -- as weather forecasts predict heavy
rain in much of the country within weeks.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Batjargal said 386 fires had hit the
country since this spring, destroying 2.4 million hectares of
forests and 7.8 million hectares of grassland.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimates show that losses caused by the fires
reached a staggering 1,591 billion tugriks (3.4 billion
U.S. dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
Batjargal also expressed thanks to the international community
for helping Mongolia in its fight against the forest fires.
</P>
<P>
Batjargal said Mongolia will draw lessons from the prolonged
fires by cracking down on arsonists and setting up a mechanism for
fire prevention.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, Mongolia will plant 5,000 to 6,000 hectares
of trees each year to restore the ecology of areas damaged by the
fires.

<HEADLINE> S. African Coal Exports Reach Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa exported a
record of 59.8 million tons of coal in 1995 despite strong
competition in the world market, the Chamber of Mines said here
today.
</P>
<P>
In its latest newsletter, the chamber said the export, worth
about 6.5 billion Rand (about 1.5 billion US Dollars), was 9.5
percent up on 1994.
</P>
<P>
South African coal was exported to some 36 countries in the
world with the bulk going to Europe and the Far East, 53.6
percent and 35 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the chamber said the international coal market for
1995 was characterized by strong growth in demand for steam coal
which resulted in the world seaborne steam coal market growing by
some 22 percent to 256 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The newsletter said about 90 percent of South Africa's coal
exports were steam coal. In 1995, the country's steam coal
exports increased by seven percent, substantially underperforming
the 22 percent rise in the overall world seaborne steam coal
market.
</P>
<P>
Steam coal demand in the Far East continued to show strong
growth as new power generation projects and higher levels of
economic growth were recorded in that region.
</P>
<P>
Growth in steam coal exports to Europe were, however, more
subdued due to the lower economic growth in that region, said the
chamber.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Pledges Support to Industrial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- President Glafcos Clerides of
Cyprus today called on Cypriot industrialists and employers to
restructure their businesses and reduce production costs to meet
an increasingly competitive environment.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference here, organized by the Employers and
Industrialists Federation, the president said that "let this
meeting provide you with food for thought for future plans and
let it be springboard for a fresh beginning. The government will
stand by your side and back your efforts."
</P>
<P>
Development in the manufacturing industry has slowed down in
recent years because of increasing competition coupled with
management problems, lack of long-term planning and low
productivity, according to the president.
</P>
<P>
He said "our industry has to operate in a new environment,
affected by electronic technology, our bid to join the European
Union and the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and we
do not share the view that our industry has no prospects."
</P>
<P>
What Cyprus needs, he said, is to improve the quality of its
products and produce new ones, apply modern methods of
development and specialization of its human resources as well as
manage funds and introduce new strategy in marketing these
products.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that his government will provide
incentives to help industrialists, including a 20 percent grant
for investment in new capital equipment and subsidy of interest
for long term loans.
</P>
<P>
The government has also decided to allocate 700,000 Cyprus
pounds (about 1.4 million U.S. dollars) for the fashion institute
and is pushing for a bill for a ten-year tax relief of profits
from the production of new products, he pledged.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reaffirms Determination to Fight Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lyon (France), June 27 (Xinhua) --U.S. President Bill Clinton
reaffirmed his determination to combat organized crime and
terrorism here today, just one day after a strong bomb explosion
killed 19 Americans and wounded many others in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president, who came here for the 22nd Summit of the
G-7 most industrialized nations, made remarks while paying a brief
visit to Perouges near Lyon this noon.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorism is one our minds today because of the cowardly
bombing in Saudi Arabia," Clinton said, adding "we will not rest
in our efforts to discover who is responsible, to track them down
and to bring them to justice."
</P>
<P>
Last year, the United States launched an international
initiative to combat terrorism, organized crime, drug trafficking
and nuclear smuggling. Upon the U.S strong proposal, the Lyon
Summit is expected to "adopt 40 very specific recommendations" to
combat crime and terror, so as to "increase our efforts to prevent
terrorists from committing their crimes and our ability to track,
catch, and punish them when they do," Clinton noted.
</P>
<P>
The Lyon Summit will discuss a wide range of issues from
economic to political fields, fighting terrorism and organized
crime is placed on the priority agenda.
</P>
<P>
"While new technologies and rapid movements of information and
money and people across national borders bringing all of us closer
together, they also make all of us more open to common dangers--
crime, drug trafficking and terrorism," Clinton asserted.
</P>
<P>
The summit will conclude on June 29 after adopting an economic
communique and a political statement by the leaders from the G-7
nations which include France, the U.S., Canada, Japan, Germany,
Britain and Italy. Russia will attend the political consultations
with the G-7 leaders.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Sees Demilitarization as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
has stressed that the demilitarization of the island is a
necessary precondition for the solution of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press here today, President Clerides said,
"There can be no solution to the Cyprus problem that will allow
the presence of Turkish troops on the island, other than those
(troops) that would participate in an international force under
U.N. command."
</P>
<P>
President Clerides made a proposal for demilitarization in a
letter to U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in December
1993, providing for the disband of the Republic's National Guard
and handing over all its arms to the U.N. custody on the
undertaking that the Turkish Cypriot side follows suit and Turkish
troops withdraw from Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops invaded this Eastern Mediterranean island and
seized northern third of the island in 1974 following an
Athens-backed coup. Since then, Cyprus has been divided into the
Turkish-Cypriot community in the north and the Greek-Cypriot
community in the south.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved despite all U.N. and
international peace efforts for the past 22 years.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides said he is not surprised that Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash rejected his demilitarization
proposal and the formation of an international force under the
U.N. to guarantee an overall settlement and the security of each
community on the island.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that there can be no direct talks between the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides before common ground on the key
aspects of the Cyprus problem is found.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no common ground as long as Denktash insists on
double sovereignty," President Clerides noted.

There were 526,064 births, compared with 555,203 deaths, in the
country in 1995, according to an annual population report released

Only because of an influx of immigrants, Italy's population
increased 55,000 in the year to a total of 57,333,996.

Italy entered into "zero population growth" for the first time
in 1993, as it was turning increasingly into a country of
one-child families.
</P>
<P>
The downward trend in average family size, main due to
financial constraints, since has continued to keep Italy's birth

<HEADLINE> 0627132 De Klerk on NP's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The National Party (NP) will
be more energetic in hastening a realignment of politics in South
Africa, outgoing Deputy President and NP leader F. W. de Klerk
said today.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk made the remarks at the Cape Town Press Club on the
eve of his and the NP's departure from the government of national
unity (GNU) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said the present political situation is much more
fluid than many realize and that the NP's term outside government
will be much shorter than most people expect.
</P>
<P>
"As the past six years have shown, we specialize in miracles,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The NP, ruled the country since 1948, will quit the African
National Congress (ANC) led government on June 30 because it
claimed the new constitution did not provide the powersharing
mechanism in the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk also stressed that whereas the 1994 general election
had been all about the past, the 1999 one will be about the
future and the ANC government's track record.
</P>
<P>
The NP's new challenge is to ensure that multi-party democracy
become a fully-fledged reality in South Africa, he said, adding
the country's future will be determined by the government's
ability to implement and adhere to sensible and sound economic
policies developed jointly in the GNU.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the NP will not distance itself from former
generals who implemented policies in the political atmosphere,
saying it is unfair propaganda which has created the impression
that the party is doing so.

<HEADLINE> Spontaneous Cease-fire Holds in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A spontaneous cease-fire has
come into effect in the capital here today after heavy fightings
continued for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
Although informal cease-fire holds at the green line dividing
Mogadishu and Bosnia vicinity, more war wounded are arriving at
the treatment centers. The wounded are mainly civilians trapped
in the war zones between General Mohamed Farah Aidid and his
rival and former Finance Minister Osman Hassan Ali Atto.
</P>
<P>
None of the three radios -- Ali Mahdi's, Aidid's and Atto's --
operating in Mogadishu spoke about the fighting and the reason
for the unexpected calmness. However, it is widely known that
there has not been any kind of peace effort between the warring
sides.
</P>
<P>
Most of the small and newly formed medical posts are full of
wounded people which they could hardly put up with. Local doctors
spoke about a severe shortage of health facilities including
ambulances, beds and essential drugs such as antibiotics and
vitamins k for clogging the blood.
</P>
<P>
The wounded militiamen are being treated at Keysaney and
Martini hospitals of north and south Mogadishu respectively.
These two facilities are free of charge while other wounded in
all other medical centers in both sides of the city are charged
with exorbitant fees.
</P>
<P>
For instance, each patient is charged with an equivalent of 30
U.S. Dollars in the first aid service rendered such as dressing
the wound and being admitted in the hospital for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
During the six days' fighting, nearly 50 people have been
killed and more than a hundred others wounded. The reason for the
renewed fighting in the capital is attributed to the on going
political misunderstanding between the rival factions in
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Very upset about the renewed fighting, inhabitants here
started fleeing to the neighboring regions due to the uncertain
situation in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Ordinary citizens said they are pessimistic about a possible
solution to the current political crisis in the Somali capital.

tariffs have gone up an average of 20 percent," he said.

<HEADLINE> SADC Leaders Act as Regional Tension Mounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Southern African states will
launch a body Friday to monitor defense and security matters amid
rising tensions due to a political crisis in Zambia and a border
dispute between Botswana and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the 12-member Southern African Development
Community (SADC) will meet Friday in Gaborone, Botswana, for an
emergency summit to ratify an agreement setting up the SADC organ
on politics, defense and security as Zambia teeters on the brink
of civil conflict, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Situation turns tense in Zambia after the government enacted
laws barring former president Kenneth Kaunda from running for the
office again.
</P>
<P>
The new body replaces the Frontline States grouping, chaired
by Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, which dealt with such
issues during the struggle against apartheid in Namibia and South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
It will operate at both ministerial and summit level with the
chairmanship rotating annually on a troika basis, according to
the draft agreement reached by foreign ministers of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) in Windhoek in January.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the SADC secretariat in Gaborone said the new
body provides a framework for coordination of security, defense
and political matters in the region.
</P>
<P>
The security organ, to have a wide mandate including military
intervention where necessary, is being set up in a region which
now has several simmering points that may erupt into violence.
</P>
<P>
The festering border dispute between Botswana and Namibia adds
to the new body's immediate problems which also include
instability in Swaziland, where the powerful monarch, King Mswati
II, is resisting demands for democratic changes.
</P>
<P>
The tension has worsened with reports that Botswana plans to
upgrade its combat capability with the acquisition of modern
fighter jets and main battle tanks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Newspapers Carry Fewer Ads for Hands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Help-Wanted Advertising
Index, a gauge of the U.S. job market, declined slightly in May,
indicating a steady unemployment rate, according to the designer
of the index of the Conference Board.
</P>
<P>
The index stood at 80, down from 82 in April, the private
research group said. It was 81 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In the past three months, the volume of help-wanted advertising
fell in seven of nine U.S. regions, according to the report of
the group.
</P>
<P>
"The market has steadied, but at a high level. Extremely low
unemployment has now been maintained for a year and a half," said
Ken Goldstein, an economist of the Conference Board. "Yet the
public is still concerned about a possible softening of the
economy that could lead to another round of layoffs," he said.
</P>
<P>
That concern is reflected in the latest dip in consumer
confidence, according to the researchers.
</P>
<P>
However, some companies are worried that strong job growth
could lead to labor shortages and raise pressure on wage costs.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said with an expected 2.5 percent GDP
growth for 1996, new job growth should continue to keep the
unemployment rate close to its current level.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that a better economy, and less cautious hiring
could spur more job growth in the second half of the year, sending
the unemployment rate closer to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board surveys help-wanted volume in 51 major
newspapers across the country every month.

CAIRO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will build a number of modern
warehouses to store antiquities as there are not enough museums to
house all the unearthed artifacts.
</P>

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Current Account Deficit Increases Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 27 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's current account
deficit amounted to 8.11 billion U.S. dollars in the first five
months of this year, surpassing the 8-billion-U.S.-dollar target
set for the whole of this year, the Bank of Korea reported today.
</P>
<P>
The country's current account deficit last month stood at 1.44
billion U.S. dollars, bringing the total for the January-May
period of the year to 8.11 billion U.S. dollars, up 60 percent
from the same period last year, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The current account comprises trade in goods and services as
well as investment income and government payments.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that since arrivals of letters of credit in may
dipped 10.5 percent from a year earlier, it is feared that the
current-account deficit will surpass 10 billion U.S. dollars in
two to three months.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's trade balance last month recorded a deficit of
790 million U.S. dollars. Exports increased a mere 6.4 percent on
account of declining unit export prices of heavy industry and
chemical products like semiconductors and chemical industrial
products, while imports rose 7.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Due to increases in overseas travel expenditures, transport and
advertising costs, the invisible trade balance in May registered a
deficit of 560 million U.S. dollars, eight times as much as the 70
million U.S. dollars registered a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The invisible trade deficit for the January-May period of this
year amounted to 2.99 billion U.S. dollars, a 141-percent increase
from the 1.24 billion U.S. dollars recorded during the same period
last year.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Deputy PM Confers with IAEA Deputy Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Premier Tariq Aziz
met here today with Deputy Chairman of the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) Maurizio Zifferero, who is currently visiting
Baghdad, Iraqi Television News reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Television News did not elaborate on the talks
between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
However, diplomatic sources in Baghdad revealed that the talks
dealt with matters related to the Iraqi nuclear arms file and
certain issues about Iraq's nuclear armament program prior to the
year 1991.
</P>
<P>
The sources quoted Zifferero as saying that Iraq no longer had
the capability of embarking on a nuclear armament program, but
that there are still certain points in the file which require
further clarification.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA deputy chairman arrived in Baghdad Sunday on a
five-day visit to Iraq, in the wake of a mission undertaken by
Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the U.N. committee in charge of
dismantling Iraq's mass destruction weapons. Ekeus obtained a
pledge from the Iraqi government last week granting U.N.
inspectors unrestricted access to the Iraqi military sites
suspected of housing banned weapons material.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA has worked out a system of surveillance in Iraq,
already in operation since late August 1994, and the Agency's
experts are undertaking regular missions in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets CPV Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today met
with Vietnamese Communist Party (CPV) General Secretary Do Muoi
over bilateral relations and international issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li Peng, who is also a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said cooperation
between the two countries has greatly expanded in recent years in
various fields including politics, economy and culture.
</P>
<P>
Leading a CPC delegation, Li is here to attend the Eighth
National Congress of the CPV, which opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee
Jiang Zemin's Vietnam visit in November 1994 and Muoi's China
visit a year later have made significant contributions to further
consolidating and developing the friendly cooperation between the
two parties and two countries.
</P>
<P>
The visits have brought the Sino-Vietnamese relations into a
new era, he added.
</P>
<P>
China highly values the grand achievements made in Vietnam's
comprehensive renovation and socialist construction over the past
decade, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He described such achievements as a result of integrating
the fundamental tenets of Marxism with the specific national
conditions and a development of Ho Chi Minh's Thought.
</P>
<P>
He expressed appreciation over the successes Vietnam has
achieved by adhering to socialism and upholding the leadership of
the Communist Party of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
China and Vietnam, both developing countries with identical
social systems, are now seeking a development path suitable to
their respective conditions, said the premier.
</P>
<P>
He said that further strengthening cooperation between the two
countries and promoting regional peace and development are in their
common interests, as their economic construction with socialist
orientation needs a peaceful and stable external environment.
</P>
<P>
Expressing sincere gratitude for the presence of Li's
delegation at the congress, Muoi said the CPV and the Vietnamese
people will never forget the great support and assistance given to
them by the CPC and the Chinese people in their revolutionary
struggle in the past.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Li Peng and his delegation have come to attend
the CPV national congress shows the "comradely and brotherly" ties
between the two parties and the two peoples, marking a milestone
and a new level in the development of the relations of the two
parties, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed sincere hope that the friendship between the two
parties, two countries and two peoples will be passed on from
generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were CPC delegation members Wen Jiabao
and Li Shuzheng, and CPV Politburo member and Prime Minister Vo
Van Kiet, and Politburo member and Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh
Cam.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Muoi held a banquet in honor of Li and his
entourage.

<HEADLINE> UN Unlikely to Increase Peacekeeping Force in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A special envoy of the Secretary
General of the United Nations said here today that the United
Nations is unlikely to increase its peacekeeping force in south
Lebanon due to its financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Kufi Anan, also U.N. assistant secretary general for the
peacekeeping affairs, stressed at the same time that there are no
problems in extending the presence of the 4,649-strong
U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).
</P>
<P>
At the end of his meeting with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri, the U.N. official said that they discussed the role of the
multinational force and its missions in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister was happy over the achievements of the
emergency force, believing that it should continue its role and
hoping that the (U.N.) Security Council would increase its number
after a 10 percent reduction," the U.N. official told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Of course we are working in a financially difficult
condition," he stressed, "and I'm not sure that the Security
Council will easily manage to increase the number."
</P>
<P>
He expected that the Security Council will not face any
difficulties in agreeing on the UNIFIL's extension in the next
review of the subject at the end of July.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council reviews the maintenance of the
peacekeeping force's presence in south Lebanon in every six
months, and in last July it adopted a decision to decrease the
force's strength by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Anan added that his talks with the Lebanese prime minister
dealt with the developments in the region, the peace process and
the Lebanese government's belief that "the peace will be the final
solution for the problems from which the region is suffering."
</P>
<P>
"The peace in this region is important not only for the Arabs
and the Jews, but also for the world as a whole," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy also held meetings today with Lebanese Army
Commander General Imad Emil Lahoud, Defense Minister Mohsen
Dalloul, House Speaker Nabih Berri and Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
In his visits to the Lebanese leaders, Anan was accompanied by
UNIFIL Commander Major General Stanislaw Franciszek Wozniak and
Political Advisor and Official Spokesman Timor Goksel.
</P>
<P>
The UNIFIL, comprising contingents from Fiji, Finland, France,
Ghana, Ireland, Italy, Nepal, Norway and Poland, was set up in
1978 to restore the Beirut government's authority over the south
of the country occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment, some 200 of its soldiers have been
killed in exchanges of fire between Israeli forces and Israel's
client militia on one side, and Lebanese and Palestinian
guerrillas on the other.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment by Israeli forces targeting a UNIFIL base at
the southern Lebanese town of Kana on April 18 killed 105 Lebanese
villagers and wounding more others, making the day the bloodiest
in the 16-day Israeli military strikes in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. report on the event, which implied that the bombardment
was deliberately carried out, outraged the Jewish state which
threatened to seek a termination of the peacekeeping force's
role.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese nationals scored two
goals against nil to beat visiting New Zealanders in a soccer
friendly here on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The win enabled China to avenge the heart-breaking 1-2 defeat
in the 1982 World Cup qualifier, when China only needed a tie to
enter the World Cup finals in Spain.
</P>
<P>
China, who may meet the old foe in next year's World Cup
qualifier, launched fierce attacks after the kick-off, exerting
great pressure on the visitors before an enthusiastic home crowd
of 50,000.
</P>
<P>
Striker Hao Haidong opened the account for China with a
powerful blast within the penalty box in the fifth minute after
shaking off New Zealand's goalie.
</P>
<P>
Gao Feng, a second-half substitute, heeled home the second on a
cross to make it 2-0 in the 51st minute.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealanders stepped up attacks after the break but their
efforts turned out fruitless before China's well-knit defense.
</P>
<P>
The visitors will tour to the Chinese northeast city of
Shenyang on Monday to meet the Liaoning Hangxing squad, the
ten-time national champions who suffered a relegation from
Division A of the Chinese Professional League last year.

<HEADLINE> Party's Work Methods Should Continue, Official says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The three important styles of work
of the Communist Party of China: integrating theory with practice,
forging close links with the masses, and practising criticism and
self-criticism are a tradition cultivated by the CPC during a long
period of struggle and must be continued, said a CPC top official.
</P>
<P>
This represents the political superiority of the CPC and is the
chief reason for the success of the Chinese revolution and
construction, said Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing Committee
of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
And, the achievements of party members and officials can be
attributed to the implementation of these three important styles
of work, Hu noted at a national meeting to commend outstanding
party officials and party committees, at Zhongnanhai, headquarters
of the CPC, today.
</P>
<P>
In referring to integrating theory and practice, Hu said, "A
major point is to examine existing problems under the guidance of
scientific theory, then judge what you have done and study
again. In this way, we can get a good grasp of the objective law
of socialist modernization."
</P>
<P>
On forging close links with the masses, he said that party
leaders should devote themselves to the people, solve difficulties
and meet the urgent needs of the masses, and guard against
bureaucracy, formalism, individualism, and hedonism.
</P>
<P>
On practising criticism and self-criticism, Hu pointed out that
"this is a must if we are to encourage healthy trends, overcome
negative factors, improve party leadership, and reduce mistakes."

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Gives Priority to Ties With China, Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia regards it a foreign
policy priority to maintain and develop friendly relations with
China and Russia, Mongolia's Deputy Foreign Minister C. Baatar
said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Baatar told reporters that Mongolia gives priority to expanding
relations with China and Russia in line with basic guidelines set
out in a 1994 document on foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
No major disputes or problems exist in relations between
Mongolia and its two neighbors, Baatar added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Mongolia will maintain friendly ties and extensive
cooperation with Russia and China under the principle of
equidistant diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Mongolian relations have developed smoothly in recent
years, with a frequent exchange of high-level visits, he said,
adding that a treaty of friendship signed during a 1994 visit to
Mongolia by Chinese Premier Li Peng had laid the legal foundation
for bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between Mongolia and China was fruitful, Baatar
said, citing timely assistance by the Chinese government in
Mongolia's fight against fierce forest and prairie fires. The
fires raged across the country for nearly four months until they
were brought under control earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia will continue to develop cooperation with China in all
fields, he added.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Parliament Adopts New Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's parliament today passed its
first post-Soviet constitution after three months of fierce debate
and on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the country's
independence from the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The constitution, approved by a 315-36 vote with 12 abstentions
after an all-night session ending this morning, takes effect
immediately, replacing the old basic law created in 1978 when
Ukraine was a former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "Constitution Treaty", signed between the
president and parliament on June 8, 1995, to define their powers,
was abolished at the same time, said Speaker Alexander Moroz.
</P>
<P>
Moroz added that June 28 will be made a national holiday in
honor of the endorsement of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
After the vote, President Leonid Kuchma told members of
parliament: "This landmark event will take its place in
Ukraine's history."
</P>
<P>
He also promised to cancel a decree he signed Wednesday
ordering a referendum in the fall to seek popular approval for the
constitution. It was the decree that broke three months of
parliamentary deadlock and sped the adoption of the new basic law.
</P>
<P>
"We proved today that we shall overcome everything if we work
together, " Kuchma said. "Starting today, there will be no doubts
about the Ukrainian parliament's efficiency."
</P>
<P>
"Our parliament is a healthy one," he said, referring to
concessions by leftist deputies who have a majority in parliament
and had opposed certain provisions in the draft.
</P>
<P>
The constitution's final text provides for broad powers for the
president and a single-chamber parliament to be elected every four
years.
</P>
<P>
It allows unlimited ownership of private property, reaffirms
post-Soviet symbols and makes Ukrainian the sole official language
in the country of 52 million.
</P>
<P>
In the final draft, Ukraine's pro-Russian Crimean peninsula
retains much of its autonomy in a unitary state. Earlier drafts
had trimmed the region's powers.
</P>
<P>
The constitution allows for only a temporary foreign military
presence in Ukraine, which may aggravate talks with Russia over
the disputed Black Sea Fleet now based in Crimea.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, leftwing lawmakers had rejected clauses
concerning the flag, the Ukrainian language and the national
emblem as well as those relating to private property.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine is the last former Soviet republic to create a
post-Soviet constitution.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said that nationwide celebrations will be held on July 3
to mark the birth of the new constitution.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Jobless Rate Hits Record 3.5 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Japan's unemployment rate reached a
record 3.5 percent in May, despite signs of an economic recovery,
the Management and Coordination Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The new record, up 0.1 percentage point from the previous
record in April, was the highest monthly level since 1953 when the
agency began using the current method to calculate the jobless
rate.
</P>
<P>
Under this method, anyone who has worked an hour or more in the
last week of a given month is regarded as fully employed.
</P>
<P>
A government report, released Thursday, said the nation's
industrial production rose 2 percent in May from the previous
month, 1.4 percentage points short of a forecast 3.4 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate dropped slightly between February and
March from 3.4 percent registered between last November and
January this year, but returned to that level in April.
</P>
<P>
The number of unemployed surged by 320,000 to a record 2.4
million people in May, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate for men rose by 0.3 percentage points to 3.6
percent in May from April, while the rate for women fell by 0.3
points to 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The agency said there were 69 job offers for every 100 job
seekers in May.
</P>
<P>
An agency official, who asked not to be named, said that there
would be no significant improvement in the unemployment situation
in the near future because large companies might continue to cut
the number of their employees.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today
lodged a strong protest to Turkey about violation of the Iranian
airspace by its helicopters, which reportedly fired rockets and
killed five women and one child inside the Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned Turkish Ambassador to
Tehran Ahmet Mithat Balkan to the Foreign Ministry Thursday and
notified him of Tehran's strong protest against the airspace
violation by the Turkish helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that two Turkish
helicopters Wednesday violated the Iranian airspace and fired
several rockets, killing six civilians and injuring 15 others in
Silvana region, 25 kilometers west of Orumiyeh, on Iran-Turkey
border.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry demanded a prompt explanation from the
Turkish officials over the incident.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish ambassador was reported to have expressed regret
and concern over the development but said that he had no knowledge
about it.
</P>
<P>
He requested for more time to receive the necessary information
from his government and relay it to the Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Iran and Turkey have turned ice-cold
since Turkey and Israel concluded a military cooperation
agreement, under which the Israeli Air Force will train its pilots
in the Turkish airspace.

<HEADLINE> FM Speaks Out on US House of Representatives' Trade Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The move to deny the extension of
most-favored-nation trade status to China, which was proposed by
some US representatives, is against historical trends and the
basic interests of the Chinese and American people, a Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
The measure is very unpopular, the spokesman said, when asked
to comment on the rejection of the motion by the US House of
Representatives in a 286 to 141 vote on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He called the rejection "wise" and reiterated that the US
government should consider Sino-US ties and stop the
discrimination in its annual review of the most-favored-nation
status for China.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that China is indignant about another motion
raised by US Rep. Christopher Cox that was passed by the House of
Representatives, and is resolutely opposed to it.
</P>
<P>
The motion made charges against China concerning a series of
problems that are utterly uncalled for. It has wantonly
interfered in China's internal affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We ask that the US congressmen adhere to the principles of
international relations and of bilateral ties that are enshrined
in the three Sino-US communiques, especially the principles of
mutual respect and mutual non-interference in each other's
internal affairs," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The US congressmen should play a positive role in improving
and developing bilateral ties, and should not pose difficulties
and obstacles in this regard," he added.

<HEADLINE> China Officially Introduces Loan Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A detailed set of rules for loans
will be officially implemented nationwide August 1, according to a
decision of the People's Bank of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The General Rules on Loans, comprising 82 articles in 12
chapters, are the first comprehensive, systematic rules on loans
since the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The rules concern loan management in "profitability, safety,
and liquidity", setting prerequisites for enterprises getting
loans from banks in marketable products, sound management, good
efficiency, and credibility, as well as other criteria.
</P>
<P>
Only those with a confirmed record of trustworthiness, do not
need to produce guarantor's certificates for loans, the rules say.
</P>
<P>
Financial institutions, as lenders, can refuse coercive
attempts to secure loans by any unit or individual and must get
back loan principal and interest in time.
</P>
<P>
Government institutions, units, and individuals, as borrowers,
should directly apply to banks for loans, and are entiled to get
and use the agreed loans as stated in the loan contract, and have
the right to refuse any additional conditions beyond the contract.
</P>
<P>
The rules also stipulate that loans must be used as agreed in
the contract and must not be used for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
Enterprise borrowers must not try to escape debts to banks by
resorting to mergers, bankruptcies and restructuring themselves
into joint-stock entities, the rules say.
</P>
<P>
Unless it is given approval by the State Council, no unit or
individual can be exempt from loan repayment or act on their own
to stop the accrual of interest or cut, delay and exempt interest
payments, the rules say.
</P>
<P>
In addition to legally-established financial institutions, no
units or individuals, governments, government departments,
institutions, enterprises, supplying and marketing cooperatives,
and rural foundations can accept deposits and give loans, the
rules point out.
</P>
<P>
The rules also bar enterprises from lending and borrowing among
themselves in violation of relevant regulations.
</P>

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China and the US have set up an
aircraft landing gear overhaul company here in Shanghai, said to
be the first of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
The venture started with an investment of two million US
dollars, 60 percent coming from the US's Allied Signal Inc. and 40
percent from China Eastern Airlines.
</P>
<P>
The CEA Allied Signal Aircraft Wheels and Breaks Repair and
Overhaul Co., Ltd. is expected to make it possible for China's
aviation industry to repair and overhaul landing gear in line with
international standards.
</P>
<P>
This will sharply reduce the need for overseas repairs and mean
a reduction in expenditures.
</P>
<P>
The new company will do overhauls for Boeing, Mcdonnell Douglas,
and Airbus, according to Hu Shanxiang, its general manager.

<HEADLINE> Six Billion Dollars in Foreign Funds for Chinese Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China is expecting to use six
billion U.S. dollars in foreign funds for agricultural development
over the next five years, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government plans to expand agricultural production
to meet mounting demand, providing market opportunities for
foreign investors, said Liu Congmeng, director of the Ministry of
Agriculture's International Cooperation Department.
</P>
<P>
China needs to increase annual grain yields by 50 million tons,
cotton output by 500,000 tons, meat production by 10 million tons,
and aquatic production by 10 million tons during the Ninth Five
Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
"China's huge market, including the demand for new technology
and equipment in the farming sector, means handsome profits for
investors," Liu noted.
</P>
<P>
In increasing its market share in China, America's Cargill
decided two months ago to set up a subsidiary that will invest in
China, with 80 million U.S. dollars being made ready for corn,
feed, and cotton seed processing projects.
</P>
<P>
Earnest Macek, Cargill president, has sent two groups of people
to China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to negotiate
cooperative projects with local farm producers, as recommended by
Vice Premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
Cargill is not alone in this. So far this year, Liu's
department has been busy dealing with foreign investors and
officials from international organizations, discussing joint
ventures or projects.
</P>
<P>
Last April, an international seminar and trade fair on
agriculture was held in Beijing, resulting in a total of 28
projects worth 330 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
An official with Canada's Agri-development Corporation said he
regards China's farm product consumer market as profitable, given
its low labor cost and preferential government policies.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted that, since China adopted the reform and opening-up
policies in 1978, more than 10 billion U.S. dollars in foreign
funds have been put into the farming sector, and that China has
established technological and economic cooperation with over 140
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors are already engaged in vegetable, cattle, and
agri-processing businesses in China. And they are also beginning
to be interested in crop cultivation, grassland development, and
aquatic production.
</P>
<P>
Provinces such as Jiangsu, Shandong, and Fujian have worked out
policies that encourage foreign investors to enter the local
farming business that give them advantages in land-use costs and
other areas.

<HEADLINE> Police Co-operation Between Mainland and HK Vital to HK's Social Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Police from China's mainland and
Hong Kong should strengthen mutual co-operation and make
combined efforts to fight cross-border crimes, said a senior
Chinese official today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Bai Jingfu, vice-minister of
Public Security, said, "This move is vital to
maintaining a good social order in Hong Kong during its
transitional period."
</P>
<P>
As it is only one year before China resumes the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, he voiced his hope that the police
departments from the two sides can expand their exchanges in the
fields of police affairs, training, technical equipment, and
sports, by forms of mutual visits and get-togethers.
</P>
<P>
Although there will be some difficulty in combating crime
together, due to the different legal systems of the two sides, he
pointed out, their co-operation will be surely broader, closer,
more effective, and fruitful, only if both sides adopt practical
measures and enhance mutual trust and understanding.

<HEADLINE> Crackdown Positive to HK's Social Order, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The current crackdown on crime
campaign on the Chinese mainland will bring positive results in
maintaining Hong Kong's social order, said a senior Chinese
official in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Bai Jingfu, vice-minister of
Public Security, said that as Hong Kong adjoins Guangdong Province
and has a close tie with the mainland, the social order of the
mainland, especially of Guangdong will be directly related to Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide crackdown campaign is a major step of the
Chinese government in an attempt to reverse the chaotic public
order in some areas, and combating determined criminals, he
pledged, adding that facts show that the campaign has made
remarkable achievements under the leadership of the party
committees and governments at all levels, as well as the support
of the people.
</P>
<P>
A large number of criminal gangs and criminals have been
captured and severely punished, he said.
</P>
<P>
Many criminals have surrendered themselves to the police and
confessed their crimes, as being in awe of the power of the drive,
while the majority of people have also actively supported the
public security departments by providing clues for investigation,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The campaign has contributed greatly to maintaining public
order and social stability, combating rampant crimes, protecting
people's life and property, and promoting people's sense of
security, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Bai said the police department of the mainland will make
continuous efforts and boost the campaign to a deeper extent.

<HEADLINE> Mainland, HK Police Co-operation Fruitful, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Co-operation between police on the
Chinese mainland and in Hong Kong is vital to safeguarding the
social stability of both sides, according to a senior Chinese
police official.
</P>
<P>
"The mainland and Hong Kong police departments have joined
hands in cracking down upon cross-border criminal cases in the
past decade," Bai Jingfu, vice minister of Public Security, said
in an interview with Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the co-operation has made great contributions to
maintaining a good public security order by both sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
The number of cases of cross-border smuggling, drug
trafficking, theft, swindling and robbery has been on the rise
since the 1980s, endangering the safety of the mainland and Hong
Kong people, the vice minister said.
</P>
<P>
The police departments of the two sides began co-operation
through the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol)
when China joined Interpol in 1984.
</P>
<P>
The mainland police have coordinated with Hong Kong police to
investigate more than 1,000 criminal cases, and in turn, Hong Kong
police has helped the mainland police to investigate some 500
cases, Bai told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
A number of murder and kidnap cases involving Hong Kong
suspects have been ferreted out by the mainland police. They
arrested more than 70 Hong Kong criminals on a wanted list and
extradited them to Hong Kong police.
</P>
<P>
The mainland has also seized more than 110 stolen Hong Kong
cars and container tractors and nine cruisers, turning them over
to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong police have provided a number of clues for solving
cases to the Interpol National Central Bureau of China and
mainland police.
</P>
<P>
They captured some wanted criminals and returned thousands of
pieces of cultural relics back to the mainland after they were
smuggled to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Police from both two sides have held 23 regular meetings in
Beijing and Hong Kong since 1985, exchanging information and
experiences, coordinating actions and solving problems in
co-operation, Bai said.
</P>
<P>
Mutual understandings have also been enhanced through meetings
across Hong Kong and the neighboring Guangdong Province, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The co-operation has helped us achieve good results in
cracking down on cross-border criminal cases," Bai noted.

<HEADLINE> National Expansion of China's Duty Security System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) - - China will expand the duty
security system nationwide starting July 1, according to a
decision reached by the State Council, the country's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The system has undergone experiments in Guangdong Province's
Dongguan, Zhejiang's Ningbo, and Jiangsu's Suzhou since January 27
of last year and in another 25 cities since April 1 of this
year. All units or enterprises in the processing trade are
required to open an account at a designated office of the Bank of
China and deposit a security for exporting their processed
products within a set period of time. Enterprises can reclaim the
security only after customs confirms that their processed products
have been exported.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics show that the contracts covered by the duty
security system in Dongguan, Suzhou, and Ningbo were valued at 9.2
billion US dollars by May 31, and a first group of 3,042 duty
security contracts had expired by May 31.
</P>
<P>
Sources at a national meeting here today said that the
processing trade has grown steadily in the experimental areas.

HARARE, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe said today it will not
interfere in the internal affairs of Zambia and will maintain
that position at today's summit of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) in Gaborone, Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge told the Zimbabwe National News
Agency in Gaborone that any intervention will be at the request
of Zambia, which is currently gripped by a political crisis
sparked by constitutional amendments that effectively bar former
president Kenneth Kaunda from contesting presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
"We must respond and only participate with and by the consent
of the country. We are ready of course to play a positive and
helpful role and we will not interfere," Mudenge said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia this week sent its Foreign Minister Lieutenant-General
Christon Tembo to brief Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe on the
current political situation in his country.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian delegation made it clear that its government is
against its internal situation being made the main agenda item at
the Gaborone summit and literally told the SADC leaders to leave
Zambia alone.
</P>
<P>
Leaders will discuss at the summit the situation in Zambia,
which has been rocked by a series of bomb explosions and
demonstrations said to be championed by a group called the Black
Mamba which is opposed to the constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
The constitution was amended to allow only Zambian citizens
with parents born in Zambia to stand for presidential elections.
Future presidents of Zambia will not be allowed to serve for more
than two terms.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Opposition Parties Urged to Make Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong called on the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) and
the Singapore Malay National Organization (PKMS) to make a public
apology to the Department of Statistics (DOS) for confusing facts.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a recent report issued by the two opposition
parties, Lee said after launching the Government Internet Web Site
that the two political parties should retract their statement that
the Government had "massaged" data on consumer prices and cost of
living, he said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition report said, among other things, that cost of
living in Singapore had escalated sharply in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Denying that the cost of living has gone up, Lee said that the
standard of living and lifestyle of Singaporeans had changed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on Thursday to respond to the
SDP-PKMS Cost of Living Report 1996, which was released earlier
this month, Paul Cheung, chief statistician of the DOS, said that
it had made the "basic mistake" of confusing an increase in
expenditure with price rises.
</P>
<P>
"It is a fundamental mistake for the SDP and PKMS to call an
increase in cost of living. This treats 'prices' and 'expenditure'
as synonymous. They are not," he said.
</P>
<P>
By looking merely at the dollar amount of household
expenditure, and interpreting it as inflation, the SDP and PKMS
had committed a basic error, he said.
</P>
<P>
The SDP and PKMS report had reportedly claimed that while
income had risen by only about seven percent, household spending,
and therefore cost of living, had gone up by 76 percent from 1988
to 1993.

COLOMBO, June 28 (Xinhua)-- A ship carrying the first batch of
goods since the Sri Lankan army recaptured the Jaffna Peninsula
from the Tamil rebels left the Colombo Harbor today for the
northern peninsula, trade sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the M.V. Reunion was carrying 3,000 tons

<HEADLINE> CASC-MDC Beijing Spare Service Center Inaugurated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A spare service center jointly
funded by China Aviation Supplies Corporation and the US Mcdonnell
Douglas Corporation was inaugurated today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
It is the second such facility in China involving a leading
world aircraft maker (the first involves Boeing) and MDC's fourth
facility of the kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
Located conveniently near Beijing's Capital Airport, the
state-of-the-art service center encompasses 790 square meters with
available space for future expansion. The inventory of the
facility, which operates round the clock, is expected to reach 10
million US dollars by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
China now flies 45 MD aircraft, and the first of 11 MD-90
passenger planes, ordered by China, will be delivered soon.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the new spare service center will not only
support MD aircraft in service in China but also many foreign
airlines that operate flights to and from the country.
</P>
<P>
"The parts provided by the center will be money-saving since
they cost the same as those in parts centers in the US, while
there will be no international freight and insurance", the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Bai Zhijian, President of China Aviation Supplies Imports and
Exports Corp said at the inauguration ceremony that the new
facility will enhance the operation of MD aircraft in China.
</P>
<P>
John Fugh, president of MDC China, said that "the move is
representative of MDC's commitment to China as a strategic market,
and to its continuing role as a major supplier of commercial
aircraft throughout the world".

<HEADLINE> Construction of Irrigation Facilities Pays Off (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The tide has finally turned for
China's third largest river, the Huaihe River, as it winds its way
through Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces in eastern
China.
</P>
<P>
Massive flooding in the Huaihe River Valley five years ago
proved a watershed for the area. Thousands of hectares of land
were overwhelmed as fields became lakes, causing staggering
economic losses to crucial crops of 34 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Drawing a lesson from the disaster, China's Premier Li Peng
said, "China cannot lead a peaceful life without help for the
Huaihe River."
</P>
<P>
Prompted by Li Peng's call, the Chinese government allocated
five billion yuan to harness the river valley by building water
conservation projects.
</P>
<P>
Now a good summer grain harvest is expected in the provinces
where the mighty Huaihe River flows.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the river valley, who have just harvested wheat, are
now busy planting rice seedlings.
</P>
<P>
While wiping away sweat from his forehead, Zhang Guo'an, a
52-year-old farmer from Qisi Township, Huaibin County, Henan
province, said he and many farmers who for generations grew dry
land crops are learning to plant rice.
</P>
<P>
"The fields are now surrounded with irrigation ditches, and the
output of rice is higher than any dry land crops," said Zhang,
explaining his switch from dry to wet crops.
</P>
<P>
The Huaihe River Valley is known as one of China's granaries,
with grain output accounting for one-sixth of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
It covers 270,000 square kilometers, and has a population of
143 million and 13.3 million hectares of farmland, both one-eighth
of China's total.

<HEADLINE> WFP Offers Food to Stem Refugee Flow into Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) said
today it has delivered more than 80 tons of food to Somalia whose
refugees could flow into Kenya anytime for hunger and insecurity.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published here, the United Nations food agency
said its convoys carrying 84 tons of food entered southern
Somalia one week ago, which is its first cross-border road
operation from Kenya in four years.
</P>
<P>
The WFP hopes that increased food availability in the Juba
Valley will stem the flow of Somalis from fleeing to Kenya and
will attract displaced people in the border area back to their
homes, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Juba Valley is one of the most vulnerable areas of Somalia
with insecurity due to bandity and clan fighting, combined with
floods and drought, leading to major shortages of food.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, 12 tons of food were delivered
from the convoys and distributed to 1,360 displaced Somalis in
no-man's land between the Kenyan and Somali borders and another
12 tons were offered to 4,300 displaced Somalis at Dobley, a town
in southwestern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The remaining part or 60 tons of food were distributed this
week to thousands of people in 19 villages in Bu'Aale and Sakow
districts, northwest of port Kismayo in the south, said WFP.
</P>
<P>
Last month, about 600 Somali refugees arrived in Dadaab Camp
in northeastern Kenya and another 1,400 are waiting at the border
in a bid to cross into this country.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- British business leaders warned
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke Thursday not to go for a tax-cutting
pre-election budget, saying it could unbalance the economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Confederation of British Industry's (CBI)
Southeast region annual dinner, CBI director general Adair Turner
said that even if the Chancellor was tempted to introduce tax
cuts, public borrowing levels were unlikely to allow scope for any
significant move in that direction.
</P>
<P>
In any case, Turner said, there was little need to stimulate
consumer spending with cuts in personal taxes.
</P>
<P>
"Consumer spending has grown by 2.5 percent over last year,
sales of household goods are picking up and the housing market is
starting to stir. And looking forward we expect further
acceleration, with robust consumer spending growth next year, even
without any tax cuts," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the focus needed to remain on competitiveness,
productivity and investment for long-term growth, avoiding any
return to the "unsustainable" consumer booms of the past.

<HEADLINE> Thirsty City Says Farewell to Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese city which houses the
famous terracota warriors has won a massive battle against chronic
water shortages.
</P>
<P>
The thirst for water plagued the one time capital city of the
ancient dynasties.
</P>
<P>
Now Cheng Andong, governor of northwest China's Shaanxi
Province, has announced that the water shortages that have
endangered the provincial capital's economic construction as well
as the daily lives of local people have evaporated for ever. It is
all thanks to a water-supply project which was put in operation
today.
</P>
<P>
The Xi'an Water-Supply Project, which connects Xi'an and the
nearby Shitouhe reservoir, started to supply water to the city
today, with Chen Junsheng, a state councillor, and Niu Maosheng,
minister of Water Resources, attending the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
With a population of three million, the city, once the capital
city during 13 ancient Chinese dynasties, is one of the 100 "most
thirsty" cities in China.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an cannot even meet the demand for water, by extensive
pumping of underground water when demand from consumers rises
sharply in hot summer months.
</P>
<P>
The water shortage has also hindered the development of the
local economy, because many industrial enterprises were forced to
slow down their production lines without sufficient water supply.
</P>
<P>
In order to solve this problem Heihe River in Zhouzhi County
was diverted into Xi'an last August, supplying 220,000 tons of
water to the city daily.
</P>
<P>
The Xi'an Water-Supply Project has a daily supply capacity of
520,000 ton of water. And this means that water shortages will
never occur to Xi'an any more, local observer said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Australia's consumer demand
showed signs of declining as people bought fewer new cars in May,
the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) announced today.
</P>
<P>
The country's total motor vehicle registrations fell by 6.2
percent seasonally adjusted in May to 51,915 from 55,351 in April,
the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
The figure was 9.1 percent lower than one year ago.
</P>
<P>
In trend terms, the number of new cars sold remained static in
May over the previous month, increasing by 0.1 percent to 54,172
from 54,129.
</P>
<P>
The figures are in conformation with business expectations.
The latest ABS survey showed that companies expected the economy
to remain flat in the latter half of this year but to pick up in
the first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The falling consumer demand will contribute to the slowdown of
the country's economy, the ABS said.

<HEADLINE> Construction of Irrigation Facilities Pays Off (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The river has a long history of being frequently hit by natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
Now the river valley has more than 5,300 reservoirs, storing 25
billion cubic meters of water, 50,000 pumping stations, and
200,000 kilometers of irrigation ditches.
</P>
<P>
They have helped turn 80 percent of the 1.57 million hectares
of saline-alkali soil into rich farmland, expanding irrigation
areas to over half of the total cultivated areas.
</P>
<P>
About one half of the dry land has been turned into paddy
fields for rice growing.
</P>
<P>
The construction of water conservation projects has enabled
Huaiyin city, Jiangsu province, to develop from a
disaster-stricken area into a land of fish and rice. It produced
more than 600 million kilograms of grain last year, and sold
50,000 kilograms to other places. Its wheat output this year
increased by 20 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
With the building of new irrigation facilities, many farmers in
Yingshang county, Anhui province, have opened up more barren land
for grain growing.
</P>
<P>
A survey report shows that more than 100 local farmers each
tilling at least 6.7 hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhao Wujing, chairman of the Huaihe Water
Resources Commission under the Ministry of Water Resources, the
irrigation projects, built in the 1991-95 period, have paved the
way for grain increases in the Huaihe River valley, which is
scheduled to expand its grain output to account for 40 percent of
the country's targeted output of 50 billion kilograms by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Zhao disclosed that the state plans to invest five billion yuan
in building more irrigation facilities, increasing irrigation
areas in the river valley by the end of this century.

<HEADLINE> US Secretary of Commerce Visits Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 28 (Xinhua) -- US Secretary of Commerce Mickey
Kantor today stressed the Bill Clinton Administration's
initiatives to strengthen commercial ties with members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
In his luncheon speech before the American Chamber of Commerce
in Thailand, Kantor stressed the importance of ASEAN to the US
economically, politically and on security matters.
</P>
<P>
The East Asia region accounts for nearly two-thirds of American
exports. Even though US exports to the region tripled in the last
10 years, US trade relationship with the region has not reached
its full potential in many sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
He saw East Asia as the competitive focus of America's future
and expressed the hope that US firms would capture a larger market
share in the region in some key sectors, in particular the
automotive, telecommunications and transportation infrastructure
sectors, and create more jobs for American workers by increasing
exports.
</P>
<P>
Kantor, leading a presidential trade and economic policy
mission to East Asia, began a two-day visit to Thailand today
after visiting South Korea and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, Kantor held roundtable discussions with Thai
and American business executives and met with Thai government
ministers to on bilateral trade and investment issues.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that during talks with Thai ministers, Kantor
showed concern about Thailand's inadequate intellectual property
rights protection and high tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The Thai side reportedly requested the US to restore the
generalized system of preferences tax concessions to certain kinds
of Thai exports and to allow imports of Thai sea shrimp after the
product was banned due to the concerns of US environmental groups
about the survival of sea turtles.
</P>
<P>
Thai ministers were also believed to have asked the US to open
its market to Thai chicken as it has banned imports due to
Newcastle disease, and raised concern over the US anti-dumping
charges laid on Thai canned pineapples.
</P>
<P>
Kantor's mission, his first to the region since he was made
commerce secretary in April, is aimed at encouraging business
development and investment liberalization in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
The US is Thailand's biggest export market. Last year, two-way
trade totaled 17.5 billion US dollars, with Thailand enjoying a
trade surplus.

LHASA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region plans to
increase its industrial production at a yearly rate of 15.6
percent over the next five years, according to the regional

<P>
An official of the Regional Planning Commission said today that
Tibet's annual industrial production value will rise to 1.26
billion yuan in the year 2000.

said.
</P>
<P>
The light industry, textile industry and Tibetan handicraft
industry will expand the production capacities of export-oriented
enterprises and speed up their technological upgrading.
</P>
<P>
Existing carpet factories will be upgraded to increase their
annual production to 89,000 square meters in the year 2000, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Tibet's annual cement production is expected to rise to 450,000
tons at the turn of this century, he said. The region's timber
production will be restricted to 300,000 cubic meters in the year
2000 in a bid to protect forestry resources, he added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rare Dwarf Horse Well Protected in Shaanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A scheme to protect a rare breed of
dwarf horses in China that stand less than a meter tall, has been
a runaway success.
</P>
<P>
Number of Ningqiang dwarf horses has galloped ahead under the
ambitious project, which has seen the numbers grow from 170 six
years ago to 264 now.
</P>
<P>
The rare Chinese dwarf horses are now well protected in
Northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The Shaanxi Provincial Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Bureau,
Northwest Agricultural University and Ningqiang County jointly
established a scientific research group in 1990 to study the
protection and development of the Ningqiang dwarf horses.
</P>
<P>
The group made a general survey of the dwarf horses in
Ningqiang, and divided the dwarf horses into two groups for
first-grade and second-grade protection.
</P>
<P>
After the survey the number of dwarf horses has been growing,
and the male and female horses are basically half-and-half, the
lowest grown-up male dwarf horse is 95 centimeters tall and the
females are 90 cm. in height.
</P>
<P>
The Ningqiang dwarf horse is of small but vigorous figure and
is adept at walking mountain tracks.
</P>
<P>
Experts in China held that the dwarf horse evolved from a kind
of horse left over by the ethnic Qiang group, an ancient
nationality in China over 2,000 years ago, when they transfered
from their central nomadic region in Northeast China's Qinghai
Province to southwest areas via Ningqiang.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Dropped From Commonwealth Aid Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has been shut out of a
proposed Commonwealth aid plan for African member countries
because of its lingering political and economic crisis, local
press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The 75 million U.S. Dollar Commonwealth Africa Investment
Fund, to be launched next month, is aimed at supporting the
development of African economies through the continent's emerging
private sector within three years.
</P>
<P>
According to the preliminary investment memorandum of the
Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), a maximum of 20
percent of the fund, or 15 million Dollars, will be invested in
each of the Commonwealth African countries "in good standing with
Commonwealth".
</P>
<P>
But Nigeria will not benefit from the fund because of its
lingering political and economic crisis. Besides, the CDC "is not
seeking any new business in Nigeria until political and economic
conditions improve," the memorandum said.
</P>
<P>
However Nigeria has been a target country for CDC with a
portfolio in excess of 800 million Dollars invested or committed
in loans and equity since its inception in 1948.
</P>
<P>
CDC has been involved in Nigeria in the fields of
manufacturing, cocoa processing and rubber production and
processing, among others.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth last November
after the execution of writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Oguni
activists, and the relations between the two sides have been sour
since then.
</P>
<P>
A decision of no fresh Commonwealth sanctions against Nigeria
made after a meeting between Nigeria and the Commonwealth earlier
this week has given a sign that the bilateral relation might
start to improve.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Error Causes Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Pilot error has been blamed for
the crash of a Chinese made Y12 plane near Dalian in northeast
China's Liaoning Province on June 21, an air investigation has
concluded.
</P>
<P>
The crash investigation team described the cause as "erroneous
operation" by the pilots.
</P>
<P>
The owners of the aircraft have been ordered to carry out an
immediate management shake-up in the wake of the accident.
</P>
<P>
Bao Peide, spokesman with the Civil Aviation Administration of
China (CAAC), confirmed that the two pilots went against flight
procedures for poor ground visibility, and brought the plane below
the accepted warning height. It resulted in the plane crashing
into a 104-meter-high hill near its destination airport.
</P>
<P>
He added the CAAC investigation team eliminated any possibility
of mechanical failure with the aircraft, bad weather or violence
as cause of the accident, based on radar data and other records,
as well as the two black boxes found intact at the site.
</P>
<P>
The 18-seat Y12 plane, with three crew members and nine
passengers on board, flew from Dalian to a nearby resort island on
June 21. It took off from Dalian's Zhoushuizi Airport at 16:40,
and crashed into a hill northwest of its destination -- Changhai
Airport on Dachangshan Island.
</P>
<P>
The two pilots died, while two of those on board were
critically injured, and the other eight suffered from less severe
injuries.
</P>
<P>
According to the investigation report, the plane's right wing
was the first to crash into the hill, then both wings and the left
engine were knocked off the plane, and the nose area of the fuselage
was wrecked by the force of the collision.
</P>
<P>
Bao, who is also a CAAC director, announced that the
administration has ordered Feilong General Purpose Aviation
Company, the owners of the crashed plane, to carry out a major
management shake-up, and warned other general-purpose aviation
companies to draw lessons from the accident.
</P>
<P>
Feilong Company, whose shares are controlled by one of China's
aircraft production bases, engages in general purpose aviation
operations, such as aerial seed sowing and aerial sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
The crashed plane was a product of the holding company - Harbin
Aircraft Manufacturing Co.
</P>
<P>
Bao said CAAC will hold a special meeting on safety management
for the 20-plus general purpose aviation companies nationwide in
an effort to improve safety in civil aviation.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Long lines of people waiting for
goods and services have always been a common sight here in
Shanghai, China's largest commercial and industrial center, but
now the reasons behind them are different.
</P>
<P>
Older Shanghai residents remember bygone days when Shanghai was
lacking in goods and materials, and local people were forced to
line up to buy food, clothes and other everyday items because
Shanghai could not provide them.
</P>
<P>
There were lines of residents waiting to buy tickets at railway
stations; old men and women and children queuing up to buy rice;
and sometimes even lines formed by bricks and baskets that were
taking the place of their owners in vegetable markets.
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of reform and opening up, commodities
on Shanghai's market are richer.
</P>
<P>
There still are many queues, long and short, in the city
streets. But now, most people are waiting for the chance to invest
their money or just do something fun.
</P>
<P>
Qu Jinghu, 70, often stands in line in front of a savings bank
near his home. "In the past, I used less than 50 yuan to feed the
whole family, sometimes I had to borrow money from neighbors.
There was no money left," Qu said.
</P>
<P>
"Now, however, I have more than 300 yuan as my retirement pension
monthly," he said. "My children also give me money, so I usually
have some remaining sum and keep it in banks."

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's sugar
industry expects a loss of multi-million Dollars during the
current season in the domestic market because of cheap imports
from Swaziland and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
At the annual meeting of South African Sugar Millers'
Association (SASMA) held in Johannesburg on Thursday, SASMA
Chairman Don Macleod said the loss of revenue from inroads by
Swazi and Zimbabwean sugar is estimated to cost the industry
about 275 million Rand (about 64 million US Dollars) for the

Much of the growth of sugar market in the Southern African
Customs Union (SACU) in recent years has been taken up by Swazi

SACU consists of Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland and
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the average mill door cost per ton of

<HEADLINE> Guizhou Benefits From Floating labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Leaving home to work at
construction sites and factories in the southern and eastern parts
of China is the trend for farmers in Guizhou Province who want to
become better-off.
</P>
<P>
The 1.35 million farmers who left their home villages in this
southwest China province to find jobs earned a total income of 6.5
billion yuan last year, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
This practice has become a way to double the money: many of the
farmers learned skills during their travels that they can make use
of back home to get rich.
</P>
<P>
Shi Weibao, a former transient laborer, now owns a 1.3-ha
orchard in Songtao Miao Autonomous County, and earns twenty to
thirty thousand yuan every year. His success is attributed to a
new technology for planting fruit trees that he learned when he
was a migrant worker.
</P>
<P>
People of the Han nationality and other minorities have
abandoned their out-of-the-way homes and floated to the eastern
coastal provinces to realize their dreams.
</P>
<P>
Most of the farmers leave home after Spring Festival, and
return before the next Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the province's population under the
poverty-line also has been reduced from 2.15 million a decade ago,
to the present 1.03 million, mostly due to transient workers.
</P>
<P>
The farmers remitted over 2.4 billion yuan through post offices
last year; this amount exceeds local farmers' net income made from
cash crops in the past.
</P>
<P>
Transient laborers' income has been invested in local
agriculture, and the development of local industrial economy.
</P>
<P>
Tian Yinghua, a farmer in the Yanhe Tujia Autonomous County,
has invested 250,000 yuan to open a stone quarry.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen young girls in Luodian County, who worked in a
foreign-funded garment-manufacturing factory in Guangdong
Province, struck a deal with their Hong Kong employer that it
would establish a clothing manufacturing plant in their hometown.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou will increase the number of its transient labors to
anywhere 2.5 million to three million in the coming three years.

<HEADLINE> Japan's May Jobless Rate Hits Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Japan's unemployment rate hit 3.5
percent in May, the highest level since 1953, despite the
continued pickup of the economy, Kyodo News Service quoted the
Management and Coordination Agency as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The previous high was 3.4 percent, registered in April and in
three months from last November to January. It declined to 3.3
percent in February and 3.1 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
Another report by the Labor Ministry said the ratio of job
offers to job seekers in May stood at a seasonally adjusted 0.69
-- meaning there were 69 job offers for every 100 job seekers.
The rate improved only 0.02 point from the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Under the current circumstances, the jobless situation is
unlikely to change dramatically, said an official at the
Management and Coordination Agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the record unemployment rate stemmed largely
from a sharp increase in unemployment among men in the 15-24 and
55-64 age brackets.

<TEXT>
<P>
Kunming, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
will invest 2.46 billion yuan to develop the Nanting River valley
and build it into a prosperous economic belt over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
This is part of an ambitious program launched by the provincial
government to develop Yunnan's vast river basins, which should
improve their economic growth and alleviate poverty, according to
a local government official.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has five large rivers -- the Jinsha, the Nanpan, the
Honghe, the Lancang and the Nujiang -- in the basins, where a
large portion of the province population lives. Building of the
Honghe border economic belt and the Lancang economic belt is
already underway.
</P>
<P>
Nanting River, with a drainage area of 8,980 square kilometres,
is a major tributary to the Nujiang River. Its valley houses
690,000 inhabitants, 22 percent of whom live below the poverty
level, existing on 550 yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
Under the investment package, Yunnan will step up ecological
protection and development of industries in the Nanting River
basin during the 1996-2000 period. More than 140,000 hectares of
forest will be grown and more than 100 kilometres of riverways
will be harnessed.
</P>
<P>
In developing local industries, the province will give priority
to tropical resources, growing about 80,000 hectares of cash
fruits and woods, including coffee, mango, pomelo, and
sugarcane. Grain output is expected to increase from 230,000 tons
to 380,000 tons during the period.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Urged to Reassess Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government was
urged today to reassess immediately the implications of its
overall plan of land use and transport including the reclamation
plans of the Victoria Harbor and the other infrastructure
projects.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Institute for Infrastructure Development today
held a press conference jointly with the Better Hong Kong
Foundation to release interim findings of a study focusing on
recent and upcoming infrastructure development in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The study calls for a review of Hong Kong's overall
infrastructure development and planning strategy.
</P>
<P>
"Viewing Hong Kong as a standalone entity will only make us
lose sight of opportunities for Hong Kong in the Pearl River Delta
region, and even in China," said Raymond Ho, honorary secretary of
the institute.
</P>
<P>
Ho said that although Hong Kong has successfully used
reclamation of the Victoria Harbor to create land, the escalating
economic and social cost of this method has led to a conclusion
that a review of this policy is required.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong's needs for expanding transport and port
facilities should be carefully examined in the context of the
changing economic and geographical landscape in China and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The government should reassess its plans to expand
infrastructure for marine and land transport with a broader,
regional perspective, to ensure that infrastructure investments
are aligned with a rational economic development policy,
minimizing waste, environmentally friendly, socially acceptable
and maintaining a sustainable development of Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that considering the huge resources required to be
allocated to the infrastructure projects, it is important to take
a more prudent step to re-examine each project on its financial
and economic feasibility.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader: Socialist Cause to Succeed Despite Setbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
today that practice has already proved and will continue to prove
that despite its setbacks, the socialist cause can overcome
difficulties in the process of advancement.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party
of Vietnam (CPV), Li, head of the delegation of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), said the socialist cause can be steadily
consolidated and developed through the practice of each individual
country, and manifest its strong vitality and bright future.
</P>
<P>
This can be achieved "as long as historical experiences and
lessons are correctly summarized, greater efforts are made to
adhere to the fundamental tenets of Marxism and basic principles
of socialism, and integrate them with the specific national
conditions and the new situation of the times," said Li, who is
also member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of
the CPC.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the CPV Central Committee, Li led the
highest-ever CPC delegation to a CPV national congress.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke highly of Vietnam's perseverance in sticking to the
socialist road.
</P>
<P>
"In the face of rapid changes in the international situation.
the Communist Party of Vietnam adheres to Marxism, Leninism and Ho
Chi Minh Thought, upholds the leadership of the Communist Party,
perseveres in the socialist orientation and follows the line of
overall renovation with economic development as the focus and
party building as the key."
</P>
<P>
Li said that China rejoices that the Communist Party and the
people of Vietnam have succeeded in finding a road to development
that conforms to its own national conditions.
</P>
<P>
"We always maintain that the choice of the road to development
for a given country should be decided by its own people according
to its national conditions. It brooks no interference by other
countries," said Li.
</P>
<P>
He said the current CPV national congress is an important one
in the history of the socialist construction of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
China is convinced that under the leadership of the Communist
Party of Vietnam, all the members of the Communist Party and the
people of Vietnam will undoubtedly succeed in bringing a more
stable and prosperous socialist Vietnam into the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Vietnamese Friendship on Solid Foundation: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng told
Vietnam's National Congress today that Sino-Vietnamese friendship
has a "solid foundation" and called for joint efforts to safeguard
the traditional friendship between the Communist parties and
peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Sino-Vietnamese friendship has a solid foundation. We
sincerely hope that ... our two countries treat each other with
sincerity, adopt a future-oriented attitude and join efforts to
safeguard the traditional friendship between the two parties and
two peoples," said Li.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier, who is also member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), arrived here Thursday to attend
the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam
(CPV), which opened today.
</P>
<P>
"China and Vietnam are linked by common mountains and rivers.
The exchanges between our two peoples date back to ancient times,"
Li said.
</P>
<P>
"In the struggle for national independence and liberation, the
parties and peoples of our two countries always supported and
cooperated with each other, and wrote a chapter of friendship."
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the two sides in various fields has been
continuously strengthened since the normalization of relations in
1991, said the Chinese premier.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the two parties and countries increased their
exchange of visits and contacts to exchange views and discuss each
other's experience in promoting the cause of socialist
construction in each other's countries.
</P>
<P>
Li highlighted the visit to Vietnam by Jiang Zemin, General
Secretary of the Communist Party of China in November, 1994, and
the China tour of his Vietnamese counterpart, Du Muoi, a year
later.
</P>
<P>
The visits "have made significant contributions to the further
consolidation and development of the friendly cooperation between
our two parties and countries and the further promotion of the
Sino-Vietnamese relations into a new stage of development," said
Li.
</P>
<P>
These visits "will certainly have a profound and far-reaching
impact on peace, stability and development in Asia."
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that the two countries have much in common in
the modern world.
</P>
<P>
Both are faced with the common task of developing their economy
and improving their people's living standards. Both are engaged
in reform and development of their respective countries according
to their own conditions, and embarking on the socialist road with
characteristics of their respective countries. And both need a
long-term international environment of peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Li promised that "we will continue our efforts to reach sound
solutions to some unresolved problems existing in our relationship
in the spirit of friendly consultation and seeking common ground
while reserving differences."
</P>
<P>
He is optimistic about the prospects for friendship between the
two parties and two peoples.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced the friendly relations between our two
parties based on the principles of independence, complete
equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs, and the friendly relations between our two
countries based on the five principles of peaceful co-existence
will further consolidate and develop," Li concluded.

<HEADLINE> China Amends Law on Mineral Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China is improving its Law on
Mineral Resources to guarantee the appropriate detection and
exploitation of mineral resources under the current market
economy.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendments to the law were submitted today for
deliberation to the 20th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the
Eighth National People's Congress, China's top legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Song Ruixiang, minister of geology and mineral resources,
explained the proposed law to committee members.
</P>
<P>
Since its implementation in 1986, the law has played an
important role in stepping up the supervision and administration
for the detection and exploitation of mineral resources, as well
as in stopping rampant digging and reducing resource waste, Song
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that some of the articles in the law cannot
meet the requirements of a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The draft makes it clear that mineral resources belong to the
state, but not to local governments or departments, and only the
State Council has the right to execute the ownership of mineral
resources on behalf of the state.
</P>
<P>
The resources underground also are owned by the state, but not
by the owners or land users.
</P>
<P>
The law formerly stipulated that the state grants the rights of
detecting and exploiting mineral resources, and the rights cannot
be transferred.
</P>
<P>
In this way, large sums of state investment used for
prospecting cannot be paid off, and the method is not attractive
to investors.
</P>
<P>
To meet the new needs of the market economy, the amendments
stipulate that mining businesses have to buy the rights to detect
and exploit minerals and have to pay resource taxes.
</P>
<P>
With the development of private and foreign-funded enterprises
and changes in China's industrial policies, the state will guide
and supervise the operation of private enterprises and allow
foreign-funded ventures to go participating in the detection and
exploitation of minerals.
</P>
<P>
The draft also has revisions for the process of approving the
right to resource exploitation.
</P>
<P>
Those engaged in unlicensed and out-of-bounds exploitation, and
illegal activities to transfer mineral resources, will be punished
by geological and mineral resource departments above county level,
the proposed law said.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislature to Review Seven Draft Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Seven draft laws were submitted
for review today to the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), the top Chinese legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, presided over
the opening session this morning.
</P>
<P>
Four of the proposed laws, dealing with auctions, control of
firearms, energy and revision, and archives, are expected to be
adopted at the end of the eight-day 20th session of the NPC
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
A draft law that would guarantee rights and interests of the
aged, a draft revision of the mineral resources law and a proposed
law on the coal industry were submitted today for initial
consideration.
</P>
<P>
The latest draft of the auction law said that "the relevant
departments under the State Council shall exercise supervision and
management over the auction industry across the country."
</P>
<P>
The NPC Law Committee said this stipulation was added in
response to opinions that call for better control over the random
development of the fledgling auction industry.
</P>
<P>
Many lawmakers said that auction houses should be limited
within major cities.
</P>
<P>
An addition was made to the draft law that cultural relics must
be identified and examined by governmental relics departments
before they are taken to auction markets, in order to prevent
valuable relics from going abroad.
</P>
<P>
The latest draft also added strict requirements for auctioneers
and is aimed at improving auction procedures.
</P>
<P>
Auction participants who cause losses to others will face
legal charges, according to the revised draft.
</P>
<P>
The proposed law on firearms control further specified who can
own firearms, and unified firearms management departments into one
-- the public security department.
</P>
<P>
The law that guarantees the rights and interests of the aged is
expected to curb the increasing trend of abuse and desertion of
the elderly in some places in the country, said Meng Liankun,
chairman of the Committee for Internal and Judicial Affairs of the
NPC.
</P>
<P>
The draft law said that the Chinese tradition of family support
for the elderly shall be maintained.
</P>
<P>
A revision to the mineral resources law was made to halt
unregulated exploitation and waste of unrecycled resources, said
Song Ruixiang, minister of geology and mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
Coal is the most important fuel in China, and the healthy
development of the coal industry needs a law governing its
production and marketing, said Wang Senhao, minister of coal
industry.
</P>
<P>
China has been the world's largest coal producer for several
years. Its production volume reached 1.29 billion tons last year.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Meets Netanyahu's Diplomatic Adviser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat met with Dore Gold, diplomatic adviser of
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyaha, in Gaza Thursday
night, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Gold, accompanied by an unnamed Likud Member of Knesset,
waited at the Erez Checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip,
where they were picked up by the chief of Palestinian Preventive
Security Agency, the radio quoted a senior PA source as saying.
</P>
<P>
They drove directly to Arafat's home in an attempt to keep the
meeting secret at the Palestinian leader's request.
</P>
<P>
There are no reports about what the two discussed. It is
believed that Gold would convey the rightwing Likud-led
government's intention to maintain dialogue with the PA and
continue the peace process, perhaps in a different way.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Jerusalem Post published today,
Netanyahu said: "I will open up channels of communication that I
deem appropriate. There will be channels at all different levels,
including the ministerial level. As well as these formal
contacts, there will be informal contacts."
</P>
<P>
"I am not prepared to cut our links with the
Palestinians. There will be a genuine, candid dialogue which
looks for points of convergence and agreement for our benefit and
for the benefit of the Palestinians," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit here earlier this week, U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher called on the new Israeli government to
resume talks with the PA as soon as possible. Christopher's visit
was aimed primarily at sounding out Netanyahu's real strategy
regarding peace process behind his public policy guidelines
prior to his visit to Washington scheduled on July 9.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislature Deliberating Law on Coal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A draft Law on Coal was submitted
for the first time to China's top legislature today for
deliberation.
</P>
<P>
Entrusted by the State Council, Wang Senhao, minister of coal
industry, outlined the draft law to the 20th meeting of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, which opened
today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Considering the importance of the coal industry and existing
problems, it is necessary to draft a law on coal to manage coal
production and marketing, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The coal industry has for a long time been the basic industry
for China's national economy, with coal taking up more than 70
percent of the country's total energy consumption.
</P>
<P>
China has been leading the world in coal production for years,
with the output in 1995 hitting 1.29 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
Along with continued development of coal industry, the minister
said that some problems have occured, such as disorderly
production and marketing, poor safety, serious waste, and damage
to infrastructure in mining areas.
</P>
<P>
The draft law, consisting of 66 articles in nine chapters, make
regulations on the management of the coal industry, construction
of coal mines, production and safety, coal marketing, and
protection of coal mines.
</P>
<P>
The draft stipulates that central departments in charge of coal
industry under the State Council are responsible for working out
overall programs on coal exploration and exploitation.
</P>
<P>
Provincial departments can work out local programs, which have
to be reported to the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises wanting to enter the coal business must first
obtain certificates, and other marketing ventures must also meet
given requirements before they can go into operation.
</P>
<P>
The state will make more efforts to protect facilities at coal
mines to ensure coal production in good order, according to the
draft.

LASAKA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's central bank, the Bank of
Zambia (BOZ), will soon set up a deposit insurance scheme to
protect clients' interests in case of bank failures.
</P>
<P>
The bank has carried out extensive consultations with experts
including the International Monetary Fund on the prospects of setting
up the scheme and preliminary work has reached advanced stage, the

<HEADLINE> Beijingers Show Concern on Giant Pandas "Hungry" for Fresh Bamboo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Panda-loving Beijing families have
offered to help save the lovable bear from extinction by planting
bamboo around China's capital city.
</P>
<P>
A wave of Giant Panda sentiment is sweeping the city after
officials at Beijing Zoo warned that a desperate shortage of fresh
bamboo leaves was threatening the animal.
</P>
<P>
The warning led to thousands of Beijingers donating money and
bamboo leaves to show their love and great concern for the
15-strong giant panda colony in Beijing Zoo.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas thrive on fresh bamboo leaves, but they also eat
millet gruel, milk, eggs and white sugar. But without bamboo
leaves, the giant pandas will die.
</P>
<P>
Feng Youqian, head of Beijing Zoo, said each giant panda eats
15 kilograms of bamboo leaves every day, leaving the the zoo to
find 225 kilograms of bamboo to feed its 15 giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
Feng said that since Beijing lacks its own resources of bamboo,
the bamboos used by Beijing Zoo have been shipped in from Boai
county in central China's Henan province.
</P>
<P>
Supplies of bamboo stopped for a short term due to the
reduction of land for bamboo planting, a reduction in bamboo
output and difficulties in bamboo transportation since this spring.
</P>
<P>
The desperate shortage in bamboo supplies aroused a rallying
call among Beijing citizens. Some suggested that a bamboo base be
built in suburban Beijing, some expressed their willingness to
plant bamboo trees free of charge, and some said that bamboo leaves
should be transported by refrigerated-units on buses which can
ensure leaf freshness.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 workers from Beijing's Lido Hotel donated over
20,000 yuan for the giant pandas; teachers and students from
Chongwen Primary School donated 1,160 yuan and young pioneers
from Beijing Honglian Primary School gave 2,181 yuan to help their
lovable giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
Students from Beijing, Qinghua and Beijing Normal Universities
have started help-the-giant panda activities, so far collecting
over 1,000 yuan in donations.
</P>
<P>
Feng Youqian said that to guarantee sufficient supplies of
bamboo for giant pandas, Beijing Zoo is contacting Boai county,
hoping to open new bamboo bases, in a bid to improve bamboo
quality and increase output.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the zoo is also seeking places suitable for bamboo
planting.
</P>
<P>
Feng also expressed his confidence that the shortage of bamboo
supplies will be settled satisfactorily and very soon with so many
people showing concern for the lovable animal.

<P>
CANBERRA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Australia's consumer demand
showed signs of declining as people bought fewer new cars in May,
the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) announced today.
</P>
<P>
The country's total motor vehicle registrations fell by 6.2
percent seasonally adjusted in May to 51,915 from 55,351 in April,
the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
The figure was 9.1 percent lower than one year ago.
</P>
<P>
In trend terms, the number of new cars sold remained static in
May over the previous month, increasing by 0.1 percent to 54,172
from 54,129.
</P>
<P>
The figures are in conformation with business expectations.
The latest ABS survey showed that companies expected the economy
to remain flat in the latter half of this year but to pick up in
the first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The falling consumer demand will contribute to the slowdown of
the country's economy, the ABS said.

<HEADLINE> China to Maintain Tradition of Family Support for Elderly by Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- As an aging society, China plans
to maintain its tradition of family support for the elderly,
instead of copying welfare systems used by Westerners.
</P>
<P>
This principle is demonstrated in a draft law that protects the
rights and interests of the old people. The draft was submitted to
the legislature here today.
</P>
<P>
Meng Liankun, chairman of the Civil Affairs and Justice
Committee under the National People's Congress (NPC), explained
the draft law to the current session of the NPC Standing
Committee, which opened today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Family support for the elderly is a good Chinese
tradition. Letting the aged people enjoy family care, love and
affection has been the major way of supporting and respecting
them, and is applicable to the Chinese reality," Meng said.
</P>
<P>
"Even though the society has developed, this tradition should
not be given up," he said. "The lesson of western 'welfare states'
must be learned from, and its shortcomings should be avoided."
</P>
<P>
China now has the largest aging population in the world, with
110 million people above the age of 60.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, a number of people have refused to provide for
the elderly members of their families, and sometimes even abuse or
desert them. Others live in their parents' houses, illegally take
over their property, or interfere in their marriages.
</P>
<P>
Meng said laws must be created to solve the problems faced by
the elderly, and to protect their rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
"The old people have made their due contributions to the state,
society and family, and in return should be cared for and
respected by the state, society and family in their old age. In
their remaining years, they should receive sufficient maintenance
and medical care, and a good quality of life should be
guaranteed," he added.
</P>
<P>
The draft law stipulated that daughters-in-law and sons-in-law
should shoulder the responsibility of supporting their
parents-in-law, as much as their spouses do. Meng said this will
guarantee family happiness and stability.
</P>
<P>
The draft law specified the legal penalties for abusing or
deserting the aged, interfering in marital affairs of the aged,
and stealing their property.
</P>
<P>
Also included in the draft is that the state investment in
welfare institutions for the aged should increase with the growth
of the national economy. People from all walks of life are
encouraged to donate to the welfare institutions.
</P>
<P>
The elderly also are encouraged to work and volunteer in
various activities if they are willing and able to do so,
according to the draft law.
</P>
<P>
The draft defined the elderly as those above the age of 60. It
proposed to make September 9 on the Chinese lunar calendar
"Chinese Senior Citizens' Day."

<HEADLINE> Canon to Reduce Stepper Output Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Canon Inc. will reduce by 17 percent
its 1996 target for production of steppers, key devices in
semiconductor manufacturing, Kyodo News Service quoted a Canon
official as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
As a result, output of the product, an exposure system for
embedding integrated circuit patterns on silicon wafers, will grow
by only 30 percent in the current year against the originally
planned 50 percent increase, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Recent moves by semiconductor makers to curb microchip
production made it necessary to revise downward the stepper
output, and Nikon Corp., the biggest maker of steppers in Japan,
was forced to lower output for fiscal 1996 by 20 percent from the
original plan, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Canon is likely to sell 120 billion yen worth of optical
instruments, including steppers, this year, compared with the
initially targeted 138.1 billion yen, industry analysts said.
Such sales totaled 92.2 billion yen in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Tourism Success Not Guaranteed: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Australia's success as a tourist
destination cannot be guaranteed despite an optimistic forecast of
the number of visitors to the country, experts in the industry
said at a national tourism seminar in Sydney today.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates of the Australian Bureau of Tourism
Research, the number of visitors is expected to double to about
eight million by 2005 while tourism earnings to exceed 30 billion
Australian dollars (23 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, as "success is dependent on smarter marketing,
creating infrastructure and developing good products, Australia
will only remain competitive as a tourist destination if we
operate more effectively and efficiently," said John Schaap,
chairman of the Tourism Council Australia.
</P>
<P>
Another speaker, Managing Director of the Australian Tourist
Commission Jon Hutchison, said that the Asia-Pacific region,
including Australia and New Zealand, was entering a decade of
enormous growth in tourism and travel.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the optimism surrounding tourism, Australia must
differentiate its approach to attracting tourists if these figures
are to become a reality," Hutchison said.

<HEADLINE> Caution for Investment In Diggers, Transformers, and Fork-Lifts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investors have been told
to slam on the brakes if they are planning to make bids for stakes
in three heavy industry sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Machinery-Building Industry has issued the
warning to overseas investors planning to bid for the country's
hydraulic diggers, transformers above 220 kv, and fork-lift
trucks, according to a recent work conference on the sector's
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
China's supply of the three products is estimated to greatly
exceed the country's demand by the year 2000. The ministry warned
that overseas investors should be cautious with any investment
plans in these sectors.
</P>
<P>
China has 14 enterprises, producing hydraulic diggers, and six
of the enterprises are controlled by foreign investors. The
mechanical digger manufacturing plant, solely founded by Daewoo
Company in Shandong Province, will have an annual production
capacity of almost 3,000.
</P>
<P>
China will turn out about 20,000 diggers by the turn of this
century. However, the country's total demand for the products will
be about 8,000 to 10,000 by the year 2000, and the market will see
an over-surplus of about 10,000.
</P>
<P>
The fork-lift truck sector includes 21 enterprises, four of
which are jointly run with foreign investors. The output from the
four joint ventures alone will reach 34,500 by the year
2000. However, China will need less than 50,000 fork-lifts by that
time. And the market will be "too small", if all of the 21
enterprises are taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
It is a similar picture in the transformer market. The ministry
will not permit any new joint ventures to be built, in any of the
three 'surplus' sectors.

<HEADLINE> Slower Growth Forecast for Singapore's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's economic growth is
likely to slow down to seven to 7.6 percent in the second half of
this year, the Straits Times reported today, citing projections by
economists here.
</P>
<P>
However, even with a slower second half, the economic growth
would likely average between 7.5 and 8.5 percent for the whole
year, as forecast by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the modest prediction largely to the
belief that it would be unlikely to repeat the surge in the
manufacturing section in the July-December period last year.
</P>
<P>
"The boom in electronics production in the second half of last
year was quite extraordinary, due mainly to the launch of Window
95," a regional economist with Vickers Ballas was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, semiconductors appeared to be overstocked this
year, the economist noted, adding that a cyclical downturn in the
electronics industry was expected in the second half of this year,
although the underlying demand for electronics products remained
strong.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the economists expected the construction
sector to remain the star performer in the second half, following
the 19.4 percent growth in the first quarter, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Consumer Prices Post 1st Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Tokyo consumer prices fell in June
for the first time in three months by a preliminary 0.1 percent
from a year earlier, Kyodo News Service quoted the Management and
Coordination Agency as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index for the month stood at a preliminary
107.1 against the base of 100 for 1990, down 0.5 percent from the
previous month, said an agency official, adding that consumer
prices continued to be stable.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year fall was attributed mainly to lower prices for
fresh fruits and vegetables compared with those in the
corresponding month last year, when unusually high temperatures
affected some crops, sending prices higher, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The movement in Tokyo-area prices is usually reported a month
earlier than nationwide figures as an early indicator.
</P>
<P>
Overall nationwide consumer prices in May rose 0.3 percent from
a year before and were up 0.2 percent from the previous month,
with the overall index standing at 107.7 against the base of 100
in 1990, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Abundant Sunlight Produces High Wheat Yields in Plateau Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have found that
abundant sunlight is one of the key factors in the high wheat
yields that occur in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
The plateau is 4,000 meters above sea level on the average and
is the highest land area in the world.
</P>
<P>
The thin air, changeable weather, cold, and frost make human
activities difficult there, and scientists have long wondered just
why wheat has such high yields without any special cultivation
techniques among local farmers.
</P>
<P>
They now say that recent findings may shed new light on this
matter and on how to boost economic growth in plateau areas.
</P>
<P>
Research has shown that the plateau's atmosphere is more
transparent, and the total amount of radiation from the sun
surpasses the average in most other areas, providing abundant heat
for crops.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the amount of solar energy, the sun's radiation
at different wavelengths also has a greater impact on various
periods the crops' growth, yield and quality, scientists say. The
special natural environment coincides precisely with the crops'
demand for light of different wavelengths in their growth process.
</P>
<P>
In addition, scientific studies have shown that the reflection
rate of wheat fields in the plateau is much lower than that in
inland areas, which is also beneficial to wheat's development.

northern Uganda, reported the local daily "The New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
Lt.Col. Edson Muzoora, the 503 brigade commander, was quoted
as adding that the government troops have captured five rebels,
including two coordinators, with some other LRA soldiers
surrendering themselves during the clashes in Kitgum District,
northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Muzoora also disclosed that a gun and several rounds of
ammunition were recovered during the battles.
</P>
<P>
"Many rebel commanders are known to be carried away on
stretchers, according to the rebels who surrender to the
government troops and the morale of the LRA rebel fighters is
very low due to the high loss," Muzoora said.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government troops are reported ready to launch a
"clean" operation next month in the northern part of the country
to end the insurgency, which has lasted nearly nine years.
</P>
<P>
Troops have already entered and stationed in Kilak

<HEADLINE> CPV Vows to Adhere to Socialism in Economic Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV)
today vowed to adhere to socialism in its endeavor to lead the
country toward industrialization and modernization planned for the
next decades.
</P>
<P>
The CPV will in whatever eventualities persist in, creatively
apply and contribute to developing Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi
Minh's Thoughts, said a political report delivered by General
Secretary Do Muoi at the opening session of the CPV's Eighth
National Congress.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) and Premier of the State Council, attended the opening
ceremony and was seated in the center of the front row together
with CPV leaders on the platform.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing Vietnam's renewal or renovation process over the past
decade, Do Muoi said the implementation of the line of renewal is
"basically correct" and in accordance with the socialist
orientation, resulting in "great achievements of very important
significance."
</P>
<P>
The tasks set by the seventh party congress in 1991 for the
1991-95 period have been essentially fulfilled. The country has
come out of the socio-economic crisis in the early 1980s, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show an average annual economic growth of 8.2
percent during the period, as against a planned target of 5.5
percent to 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The path to socialism has been more and more clearly defined
and the leading role of the party should be enhanced, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The report also highlighted the need to build a multi-sector
commodity economy operating in parallel with the strengthening of
the role of state management along the socialist line.
</P>
<P>
A multi-sector economic structure will allow the existence of
state capitalist economy, the individual and small owner economy
and the private capitalist economy, the report said.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996-2000 period, termed in the report as a critical
stage to turn Vietnam into a basically industrialized country by
2020, the renewal process will include a vigorous development of
the commodity and services market, a strict control over the land
and real estate market and the building of a capital market.
</P>
<P>
The average annual growth rate of the gross domestic product by
the year 2000 is set between 9 to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
On foreign affairs, Vietnam will strive to create a peaceful
environment and further favorable international conditions for its
economic development, the report said, adding it will continue to
seek settlement of problems and disputes through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The report said Vietnam will do its utmost "to increase our
relations with neighboring countries and other ASEAN (Association
of Southeast Asian Nations) countries" and to "attach importance
to relations with developed countries and economic-political
centers of the world."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Court Opens Hearing Against Bosnian Serb Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
opened today a hearing of evidence against Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic and his military commander Gen. Ratko Mladic.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations court, based in the Hague, the Netherlands,
also announced today that it has indicted eight Bosnian Serbs --
all still at large -- for the organized mass rape of Muslim women.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it indicted nine Bosnian Croats for atrocities
against Muslims in central Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from the Hague, the rape indictment was
the court's first dealing with the offense during the 43-month
conflict in the former Yugoslav republic as a war crime.
</P>
<P>
As the most-wanted suspects, Karadzic and Mladic were indicted
twice for genocide and crimes against humanity. But they have
rejected the court's authority and refused to surrender for trial.
</P>
<P>
The indictments charge Karadzic and Mladic with ordering or
failing to prevent the shelling and sniping of Sarajevo civilians,
and the alleged slaughter of thousands of Muslims after the fall
of the U.N. enclave of Srebrenica last July.
</P>
<P>
The first witness of a total of 15 scheduled to testify in the
seven-day hearing was Professor Paul Garde, a French linguist and
historian, who sketched a brief history of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In coming days, according to Swedish prosecutor Eric Ostberg,
the mayor of Sarajevo, Dutch peacekeepers, two former U.N. human
rights observers in Bosnia and a Canadian peacekeeper taken
hostage by Bosnian Serbs will testify before the three-judge panel.
</P>
<P>
"The prosecution submits it would be inconceivable that the
accused, Karadzic and Mladic, did not give their approval in the
massive criminal operation of ethnic cleansing," Ostberg said.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic's lawyer, Igor Pantelic, was denied access to
prosecution files but allowed today to listen to the indictments
in the courtroom, and then was sent to sit in the public gallery.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal was set up by the
U.N. Security Council in 1993. But it doesn't have the
enforcement powers to bring the convicted into custody.
</P>
<P>
Of the 75 suspects the court has indicted so far, only seven
has been under custody in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
While atrocities have been blamed on all warring parties in the
Bosnian war, international observers say the bulk have been
committed by Serbs.

<HEADLINE> Demonstration Staged in Lyon Against G-7 Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LYON, France, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Several hundred people took
part in the demonstration here today against the policies of the
world's most developed nations.
</P>
<P>
The protest took place when leaders of the group of seven (G-7)
industrialized nations gathered in this southeastern French city
for a three-day summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful demonstration, organized by a group of 53
non-governmental organizations, consisted of a series of speeches
at Lyon's city labor exchange.
</P>
<P>
"The G-7 presents itself as the pilot of the general ship of
world affairs, thus it places itself in a situation of power and
responsibility," said Nigerian Nobel Literature Prize laureate
Wole Soyinka, who chaired the event.
</P>
<P>
"However," Soyinka noted, the group's collective course
"militates against the well-being of the majority of peoples."
</P>
<P>
This, he added, is "leading to mass unemployment, a widening
gap between the North and the South and even more profoundly
between the affluent and the poor in every society."
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to the members of the G-7 to take stock of their
power and its failures, to be aware of the consequences of the
policies that they set in motion," he said.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was one of three staged to coincide with the
G-7 summit, which drew here leaders from France, the United
States, Canada, Britain, Germany, Italy and Japan.

<HEADLINE> India to Widen Workers' Share in PSUs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- In a new plan for public sector
undertakings (PSUs) restructuring and more transparent
disinvestment, the Industry Ministry has proposed to widen
workers' shareholding and mass ownership of the PSUs, Industry
Ministry Sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The plan has been put up before the cabinet Committee for
Economic Affairs to consider.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has reiterated that the government will retain
"golden shares" to protect the national interest. This is meant to
equip it with the power to prevent anybody or group from acquiring
more than a certain percentage of the company's voting share
capital. The golden shares, with a face value of one rupee, would
give the government the right to veto any disposal of PSUs' assets
or its closure, the same sources said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's note seeks commitment of trade unions for the
success of the disinvestment process while assuring that measures
would be implemented to protect their interests. Part of the
income derived from disinvestment would be diverted to rejuvenate
the national renewal fund to provide an effective social safety
net for workers.
</P>
<P>
Modeled on the British experience, the proposal outlined by the
Department of Pubic Enterprises seeks to provide a human face to
disinvestment process by spreading the ownership as wide as
possible. It has suggested that the disinvestment strategy should
aim at offering substantial number of shares to workers who will
have the freedom to exercise their option.

HARARE, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government
yesterday announced a new tariff regime that will largely benefit
the ailing clothing and textile sector, battery manafacturers,
importers of raw materials, educational materials, medical
equipment, goods for the blind and disabled.
</P>
<P>
The new tariff rates range from a minimum of 5 percent to a
maximum of 50 percednt on finished goods.
</P>
<P>
In particular cases, tariffs higher than the maximum level
will be applied to clothing and textiles, electronics, batteries,
luggageware and selected agricultural products in protection from
external competition.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the new tariffs, Deputy Minister of Finance Misheck
Chinamasa said the new tariff structure would come into effect on

should look at the new tariff handbook available to the public on
Monday.

with South Africa was being dealt with separately and the current
discussions were in the right direction.

The tussle for the UN top post could well degenerate into a
rancorous affair, said the article entitled "Public rejection of
UN chief by US is crude and rude" with a by-line of Felix Soh, an
editor of that major English newspaper here.
</P>
<P>
Washington's unequivocal opposition against another five-year
term for Boutros Ghali "will, in effect, lead to a contest of
wills between the Western and industrialized countries and the
developing nations," the article warned.
</P>
<P>
"While the US is entitled to make its own choice, its rejection
of the incumbent should not have been conveyed in the crude, rude
and graceless manner it was done," it said.
</P>
<P>
The article was accompanied with a caricature of knives flying
out of Uncle Sam's mouth towards the UN chief's back.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, American behavior has been downright disrespectful of
the man. Regardless of whether you love or loathe him, he
deserves treatment befitting his status and the office he holds.
Was it necessary to make him lose face?" it said.
</P>
<P>
The article quoted White House spokesman Mike McCurry as saying
once: "We think there are most likely other people in the world
who would be more capable of pursuing the type of UN reform agenda
that is needed".
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, Nicholas Burns, spokesman for US State
Department, said, "We would hope that Secretary-General
Boutros-Ghali would come to see that our decision is irrevocable
and we must turn our attention to identifying another candidate
... Our minds will not be changed".
</P>
<P>
The article observed that the hostile comments by American
officials on Boutros-Ghali, perfect sound-bites for the media,
were "obviously tailored for domestic consumption as this is an
election year."
</P>
<P>
But, it pointed out that instead of going about it in a
"blunderbuss way which can turn ugly by launching into personal
attacks, the US ought to consider the more subtle and tactful
approach adopted by ASEAN governments to resolve thorny issues".
</P>
<P>
"Rather than go for a win-lose outcome, the chances are bright
for a win-win resolution," the article said.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the way, it stressed that "the US should stop
fantasizing about being a John Wayne-type sheriff riding into
Dodge City to clean up the town."
</P>
<P>
"It must abandon its bully-boy attitude. The international
community expects the US, the world's only superpower, to
demonstrate more maturity," it concluded.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Tamil Parties Reject Unitary State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of six of Sri Lanka's
Tamil political parties have told President Chandrika Kumaratunga
that they were opposed to the unitary character of the state, as
proposed in her package of devolution, according to official
sources today.
</P>
<P>
They told the president at talks with her on Thursday night
that they had always been for a separate state of Tamil Eelam but
now they had settled for a political solution based on federalism.
</P>
<P>
The choice was between a federal state and an unitary state.
Any reference to a unitary state in the Constitution would entail
a situation where the Supreme Court would be in favor of the
central government in the event of a constitutional dispute, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said this would make the process of devolution
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that a two-third majority was
required in Parliament to have the legislation passed and the main
Opposition United National Party was insisting on a unitary state.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil party leaders insisted that if they all stood
together on the government's original stand of proposing to do
away with the unitary state, the opposition would relent and
support the legislation.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil parties which met the President last night were the
Tamil United Liberation Front, Eelam Revolutionary Organization of
Students, People Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam, Eelam
People Democratic Party, Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation
Front and the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
The devolution package announced by the president last August
aims to resolve the long-standing ethnic crisis in the country. It
contains proposals for redemarcation of the north and east
provinces and for extending more powers to Tamils in the these
provinces.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The 13-party United Front
government headed by Deve Gowda is expected to be expanded here
today.
</P>
<P>
The expansion is aimed at giving representation to partner
parties, regions and communities which did not figure in the
formation of the 21-member cabinet on June 1. It will include
members from some of the other eight parties in the 13-party
combine, representatives from the eastern, north-eastern and
western regions, and minority, tribal and upper caste members,
government sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the Communist Party of India (CPI)
Indrajit Gupta is expected to get the crucial home portfolio.
Agriculture and labor portfolios are also expected to go to CPI
representatives.
</P>
<P>
Biren Baisya, leader of Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), another
constituent of the United Front, is also set for the inclusion
into the union cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The much-awaited expansion comes nearly a month after the CPI,
the only left party in the 13-party combine, took the decision to
participate in the government. The Communist Party of India
(Marxist) (CPI-M) has time and again refused to join Gowda's
government.

<HEADLINE> Former Nicaraguan Contras to Ask U.S. Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The former U.S.-funded Nicaraguan
counterrevolutionaries (Contras) residing in the United States
will demand the U.S. government to compensate the relatives of
8,000 dead and 15,000 maimed Contras who fought the Sandinista
government in the 80's.
</P>
<P>
The "El Nuevo Herald" newspaper in Miami, the United States,
reported today that the contras made the decision as the
U.S. Senate and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) decided to
compensate 500 former Vietnamese spies and commandos with 20
million dollars, who had worked for the United States during the
Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
No date has been set for the filing of the demand.
</P>
<P>
"We provided the dead and the United States provided the
bullets to promote its interests," said Luis Moreno, who six years
ago commanded a U.S.-funded battalion of rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas, who took power in 1979 after defeating
dictator Anastasio Somoza, were defeated in the general elections
by incumbent President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro in February of
1990.
</P>
<P>
In April 1990, the Chamorro government, the Sandinist National
Liberation Front and the contras reached an agreement on the
demobilization of the contras. In June 1990, some 20,000 Contras
were demobilized and surrendered their weapons to the new
government and international observers.

<HEADLINE> India Projects 20 Percent Export Growth Per Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- India's exports will rise to 90
billion US dollars a year by the year 2002 with a projected growth
of 20 percent in dollar terms annually, said a study published
here today.
</P>
<P>
This is nearly three times the export value of 31.8 billion
dollars achieved by the country in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The estimate is derived from statistical projections made by
the Commerce Ministry. The comprehensive review has three main
components. It is based, first, on export performance in specific
sectors, exports from which constitute about 95 percent of the
total, in the past three or more years.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the export performance for a similar period has been
reviewed for nearly a hundred export items which account for about
98 percent of exports.
</P>
<P>
Finally, about 30 export promotion councils and commodity
boards have given their feedback about past performance and future
plans for new export markets and products, the study said.
</P>
<P>
India is optimistic about the scenario for export growth
because the export-GDP (gross domestic product) ratio has shown a
steady increase in the last four years. While exports constituted
8-9 percent of GDP four years ago, the proportion is now up at 12
percent, the study added.

The 60-megawatt Khimti project, about 100 kilometers east of
Kathmandu, would be completed in three years with an estimated
cost of 126 million US dollars plus 30 million Norwegian kroner.

Finance Corporation have agreed to provide 31 million and 28
million dollars in commercial loans respectively for the project.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The Khimti hydropower project is Nepal's first one in which
foreign private investors have a stake.
</P>
<P>
The project's five generating units are expected to be
completed and go into operation by the end of 1999.
</P>

KATHMANDU, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's budget for the
forthcoming fiscal year would focus on ensuring job opportunities,
poverty alleviation and economic growth, according to finance
minister Ram Sharan Mahat.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a discussion program on the budget held at his

problem.
</P>

The government is facing the challenge of maintaining balance

<P>
According to him, the government expenditure has been
increasing for the last few years and the ratio of budget deficit
and international borrowing in the country's gross domestic
product (GDP) in the outgoing 1995-96 fiscal year would remain
almost the same as the previous year.
</P>

Official figures showed that the ratio was over 70 percent in

<HEADLINE> Dominican Election Too Close to Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTO DOMINGO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Sunday's second round
presidential election in the Dominican Republic will be closely
fought and experts predict that whoever wins will do so by a
slim margin.
</P>
<P>
Most experts contacted by Xinhua were unsure of the outcome of
the second-round race between the Dominican Revolutionary Party
(PRD) candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez and his rival Leonel
Fernandez Reyna of the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD).
</P>
<P>
Outgoing President Joaquin Balaguer and his Christian Social
Reformist Party have thrown their support behind Fernandez after
their candidate, millionaire businessman Jacinto Peynado, was
knocked out in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Balaguer, who has ruled the country for 22 of the last 30 years
has been banned from standing for re-election following
accusations of irregularities in the last presidential election in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, who was Balaguer's main opponent in the 1994
presidential election, came second in the first round of the
election, with 38 percent of the vote, while Pena Gomez won 46
percent, just short of the 50 percent necessary to win outright.
</P>
<P>
A poll carried out by the local "Temas" magazine forecast a
second-round victory for Pena Gomez with 53 percent of the votes,
against 47 percent for Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
The Griffin Foundation Institution and the Strategic Research
Bureau also forecast a Pena Gomez win over Fernandez by a margin
of eight percentage points.
</P>
<P>
However, polls by the Global Strategy Group and Gallup
Institute both predicted a Fernandez victory.
</P>
<P>
Some three million of the 3.75 million eligible voters, are
expected to cast their ballots Sunday.

The resolution, proposed by 17 congressmen after President Bill
Clinton decided to extend China's MFN in late May, was debated by
the House for about three hours this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
During the session, many congressmen from both the Democratic
and the Republican Parties, argued that withdrawing China's MFN
trade status is unreasonable. Jennifer Dunn of Washington state
said that the term of MFN should be changed to "normal trade
relations," which should be given to any country that permits
U.S. firms to invest and do business there.
</P>
<P>
Some congressmen, as what they did in the same manner when
talking about China, attacked China on the issues of human rights,
trade imbalance, arms sales, Tibet and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Their hostile attitude toward China was criticized by other
congressmen. Sam Gibbons of Florida said nothing new is in the
debate today. "China has been making progress" in many fields,
and the United States should keep contacts with China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hamilton of Indiana said China is an important country in
the world today and the U.S.-Chinese relations are very
important. Withdrawing China's MFN status will represent a step
backward in relations with that country, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Today, we should vote for the interests of the United States,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
After the vote, the American National Association of
Manufacturers (NAM) applauded the result. "Today's vote to
approve the Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) status for China is a real
victory for American manufacturers and workers," said Dianne
Sullivan, director of trade policy for the NAM.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to continue working with the Congress to end these
annual debates and look forward to granting permanent MFN status
to China in the near future," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Senate will not debate on the resolution. However, both
chambers of the Congress will decide whether they approve or
disapprove the decision made by Clinton on China's MFN extension
before August 31.

<HEADLINE> US Air Force Plane Makes Emergency Landing in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A Japan-bound United States Air
Force Boeing 707 plane made an emergency landing at Manila Airport

<HEADLINE> Dogs Sniff out Drug traffickers in Yunnan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Police dogs have become a serious
menace to drug traffickers stopped by police in roadside checks in
Yunnan's frontier areas, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The dog, Shelley, named after the British poet, Percy Bysshe
Shelley, whose life was arguably ruined by drugs, is one of the
top dogs on the 35 dog anti-drug squad being trained by Yunnan's
customs service.
</P>
<P>
Braving a soaking rain early last month, Shelley sniffed out
2.2 kilograms of opium stashed in a wicker basket full of
bananas. Three drug traffickers were netted.
</P>
<P>
According to Hou Weidong, deputy director of the Ruili training
base, training dogs to sniff out narcotics differs from training
dogs to serve in the military or police.
</P>
<P>
"Drug training program focuses on heightening the dog's sense o
smell and making them able to maintain an intense degree of
concentration."
</P>
<P>
"They can follow and finally catch the source of the odour, and
never get distracted whatever the surroundings," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Within two hours of his first ambush of suspected drug
traffickers, Shelley uncovered three batches of heroin and two
kilograms of morphine, immediately sending waves of panic through
traffickers in the region.
</P>
<P>
A bit of rivalry has sprung up around the dogs. an official
from the General Administration of Customs who visited the
training base, questioned Shelley's status, insisting he is
inferior to Quarry and Shark, both Canadian breeds.
</P>
<P>
"Compared to the other two, Shelley is less bulky and fierce,
though he is more shrewd and enduring," he said.
</P>
<P>
Star dogs from the center also include Silver Tiger and
Legendary Sword, who teamed up to seize 22 kilograms of poppy
shell and 11 kilograms of poppy seeds the same day Shelley sniffed
out the banana basket.

GUANGZHOU, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Working couples in Guangzhou
City, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, are trying new
ways of spending their spare time, in an attempt to relax after a
day of on-the-job pressure.
</P>
<P>
More people are hiring workers from household services to do
the household chores for them -- things that they did themselves
without question, in the past.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou now has some 40 household service companies, which
offer the following conveniences: meals on wheels delivered to the
door, vegetables delivered to one's doorstep, giving children a
ride to kindergarten and back home, laundry, housecleaning, and
maintenance of household appliances.
</P>
<P>
One young woman, Miss Liu, works for a foreign trade company
and said she plans to study a foreign language.
</P>
<P>
So, she pays a teacher 15 yuan per hour to come teach and also
hires a cook to cook meals for her. The cook gets 15 yuan per hour.
</P>
<P>
Miss Liu said that such services are good for both work and
study.

<HEADLINE> Seniority No Longer Brings More Money for Elder Women in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Seniority no longer means more
money for women in the Chinese capital, according to the results
of a survey conducted by a research center of the State Science
and Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
The survey looked into the income of 1,000 women in Beijing. It
found that the monthly average income of women aged from 18 to 24
is 916 yuan; women aged from 25 to 29, 925 yuan; women aged from
30 to 34, 1,451 yuan; and women aged from 35 to 40, 894 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The result showed that the eldest group made the least money
and that income and seniority have no obvious relationship.
</P>
<P>
During the planned economy period, people's seniority and
income were directly proportionate as their positions and length
of service differed.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that employees in foreign-funded
enterprises and private enterprises earn more than those who work
in collectively-owned enterprises, state-owned enterprises, party
or governmental organs and institutions.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Private Enterprises Benefit from Securities Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Zunrong Group has become the
No.1 share-holders of the Zhonghao Co. Ltd, which is quoted on the
Shenzhen Stock Exchange, by purchasing 15 percent of Zhonghao's
shares.
</P>
<P>
The local securities administration has approved the transfer
of 23.58 million shares, Zhonghao's board of directors say, and
they hope that the move will breathe new life into Zhonghao,
improve its profits, and upgrade its operations.
</P>
<P>
An analyst points out that similar large Chinese private
enterprises are building themselves up by making use of the
fledgling securities market.
</P>
<P>
Although it started as a small company, Zunrong has assets
valued at four billion yuan, and is active in the finance, real
estate and infrastructure sectors.
</P>
<P>
Some mistakes in investment over the past few years led to a
large amount of idle funds and mountains of debt at Zhonghao,
which recorded 11 million yuan in losses in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Zunrong has plans to reshuffle Zhonghao's assets, use new
capital to improve its debt structure, and use its projects to
generate high profits.
</P>
<P>
Such things did not happen before private enterprises were
allowed to purchase shares of listed companies, said an official
with Shenzhen's securities administration. "This indicates that
private companies are becoming stronger."
</P>
<P>
The market reacted strongly to the purchase. After the
announcement of Zhonghao's purchase was formally made, the price
of its shares went up by about 30 percent.

gradually eliminate poppy cultivation by promoting the standard of
living of the nation's ethnic groups.

<HEADLINE> Breakaway Party Expected to Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The breakaway Prachakorn Thai
(Thai Citizen) Party (PTP) is expected to return to the coalition
government after Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa extended a
formal invitation.
</P>
<P>
The invitation came at a time when the coalition will face an
opposition censure debate after July 10 and it was agreed upon by
leaders of the six ruling coalition parties during a meeting at
the government house on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today reported that the PTP has dropped its
condition that the Palang Dharma (Virtue Force) Party (PDP)
apologizes for its unilateral behavior in the coalition before its
return.
</P>
<P>
The PTP left the coalition on June 14, complaining that Banharn
favored the PDP. The departure of the party, which has 18 seats in
the house of representatives, made the coalition's strength in the
house drop to 214.
</P>
<P>
The PTP earlier repeatedly vowed never to return unless the PDP
confessed to its faults.
</P>
<P>
The PDP abstained during the censure debate vote in May on
former deputy interior minister Suchart Tancharoen. The PTP
accused the PDP for breaking the ranks.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the six ruling parties also agreed that their
parties will adhere more strictly to the rules set when they
formed the government in July last year and consult each other
more to coordinate their efforts.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said that in the past, they have spent so much time
working for ministries under their control that they neglected
their political work.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that they will seek mechanisms to ensure the unity
of the coalition.

<HEADLINE> Latin American, Caribbean Economies Lag Asian Tigers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Latin American economies are
lagging behind the Asian "tiger" economies and should improve the
competitiveness of their exports by speeding up technological
development and specialization, the Economic Commission for Latin
America and the Caribbean (CEPAL) said today.
</P>
<P>
Investment in technology in Latin American and Caribbean
countries is much lower than in Asian countries such as South
Korea, Singapore, China and Indonesia, and researchers don't have
enough money or support, CEPAL said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The slower pace of technological specialization of exports in
the region compared with its Asian competitors is caused by
several factors, including poor public policy toward technological
development, poor investment in research and development and
negligible spending on innovation by private enterprises, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Most Latin American countries increased their exports
considerably at the beginning of the 1990s, but progress toward
boosting exports of products with higher added value has been very
limited.
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem lies in poorly defined policy objectives,
failure to prioritize technological development and poor
development and education of the workforce, said the report.

MANILA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- the Philippine central bank remains
confident that the country's inflation rate will finally ease to
single-digit and reach 6 percent by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
business world reported here today that although June has
traditionally been the time for spending, historical data show May

<P>
The May-June inflation rates for 1991 through 1993 declined
from 20.1 percent to 9.2 percent, and then, 6.7 percent. Last
year, the rate increased slightly from 6.8 percent to 7.2 percent,
the first time in five years.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributes its confidence to the prospect of a
better harvest for the agricultural sector, the deregulation of
oil industry and the decline in the prices of petroleum products
in the international market.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Evaluates Antidrug Operation in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Experts from the United States are in
Peru this week to assess the effectiveness of its anti-drug
operation "Laser Strike," which uses radar to detect planes and
production centers used in drug trafficking, the El Comercio daily
paper said today.
</P>
<P>
"Laser Strike," which started in April, is a joint campaign by
the U.S. and Peru aimed at preventing the transportation of drugs
by air or inland waterways.
</P>
<P>
The operation involves U.S. Air Force AWAC planes flying over
Peru to sniff out drug traffickers' aircraft. Any planes, landing
strips and drug production centers discovered are then destroyed
by the Peruvian anti-drug agencies.
</P>
<P>
The AWACs now have the support of a satellite to locate landing
strips and centers for processing and loading drugs.
</P>
<P>
The three-day U.S. inspection, carried out by air defense
specialists, ends tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
"Laser Strike" is carried out by the U.S. Army Southern
Command, a division of the U.S. Army in charge of Latin American
operations, to provide intelligence, detection, vigilance,
training, logistics and communications to help the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) fight drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Not to Accept Karadzic's Conditions for Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States made it clear
today that the conditions offered by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic for his resignation as "President" and withdrawal from
the country's elections on September 14 were unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Bosnian envoy John Kornblum told reporters here that his
government has not yet received any formal notice of Karadzic's
offer, and will definitely not accept the reported conditions
because they go against the Dayton peace accord which ended the
nearly four-year war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum arrived here for further talks with the Muslim-led
Bosnian government before flying to Lyon, France, for the Group of
Seven major industrialized nations conference.
</P>
<P>
He had held seperate meetings with Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic in Belgrade and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman in
Zagreb on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said what the U.S. wants most is to see Karadzic to be
delivered to the Hague International Court to answer the war
crimes charges for which he has been indicted.
</P>
<P>
But at present, Kornblum added, the most important thing is
Karadzic's unconditional removal from any position which will
allow him to impede the implementation of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serbs announced Karadzic's resignation on
Wednesday, under mounting pressures from the international
community and Serbian President Milosevic, who believe his
continued presence in office is a threat to the Bosnian peace
process and the post-war nation-wide elections in September.
</P>
<P>
"In agreement with the Bosnian Serb leadership and due to the
horrible pressures by the international community and Yugoslavia,
Karadzic decided not to take part in the elections," Bosnian Serb
Prime Minister Gojko Klickovic told reporters in Banja Luka in
northwestern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
But he said Karadzic's decision is conditional on international
community's guarantees for a recognization of the statehood of
the self-declared Republika Srpska, the Serb entity in Bosnia, and
for mediation over the control of the disputed northern town of
Brcko remaining in the Serbs' favor.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic's conditions for resigning were immediately rejected
by Carl Bildt, the international community's high representative
in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Bildt's spokesman, Michael Maclay, reiterated today that
Bildt's position is very clear: that is full compliance with the
Dayton peace accord, a deal which committed indicted war criminals
such as Karadzic to quit office and surrender to the Hague war
crimes tribunal.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Reduce Subsidies to State-Owned Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
reduce its subsidies to state-owned firms in a bid to tighten the
government's financial position.
</P>
<P>
According to Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo, the
government's consolidated public sector financial position
continues to suffer as government-owned-and-controlled
corporations' (GOCCs) subsidies drain the state of scarce
resources.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo said that Aside from a stringent review of subsidy
requests for taxes and advances, the government will also strictly
enforce the mandated remittance of 50 percent of the GOCC's net
earnings as dividends to the government.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will also charge an interest everytime
the Bureau of Treasury gives GOCCs advances for their debt
servicing and impose fees on the guarantees extended by the
government on loans contracted by the state firms.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit of monitored GOCCs stood at 1.3 billion
pesos (50 million US dollars) in 1995. The number was 9.8 billion
pesos (377 million US dollars) in 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine must have its own modernized
armed forces and maintain its defense power at a necessary level,
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said today.
</P>
<P>
Though the military and political environment surrounding
Ukraine is quite good, military dangers still exist, Kuchma told
the first graduates of the Ukrainian Institute of the Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Ukraine's non-alignment policy does not
mean self-isolation. In fact, he pointed out, Ukraine has signed
agreements with 32 countries for defense cooperation and has been
actively involved in the Partnership for Peace Program of the
North-Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The president said Ukraine is working on a program for the
reform of its armed forces before the year 2001, under which the
state leadership over the armed forces will be improved, the
structure of the armed forces and the management of weapons be
optimized, the defense technologies and logistics be upgraded, and
the training and mobilization be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
The country's leadership will do all it can to maintain the
defense power at a necessary level and improve the living
conditions of the servicemen, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the new defense concept, outlined for
the first time by Kuchma since taking office in July 1994, will
have a considerable impact on the building of the country's armed
force.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Cut Import Duty by 20 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Bureau of Customs
(BOC) announced Thursday that tax and duties to be imposed on
imported articles will be 20 percent lower starting July this
year.
</P>
<P>
BOC said the shift from the home consumption value to the
export value will keep the country's commitment to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) now known as the World Trade
Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
It explained that the export value method is just a transitory
system until the shift is made to "the transaction value", which,
according to GATT/WHO, must take place by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Studies showed that customs revenue collection are expected to
decline because of the move, but the losses will be offset by the
projected increase in the volume of imports.

<HEADLINE> Cooperation Between China's Eastern And Western Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Xiangshui County in Jiangsu
Province has moved its sodium chlorate production to Qinghai
Province, a project that costs more than 100 million yuan in
investment.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest investment project that Qinghai has gotten
from eastern coastal provinces in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts say that China's eastern and western parts
have started joining hands in projects, having discovered that
both sides benefit from the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The sodium chlorate production was a key project for increasing
output of white paper pulp. But, with annual electricity
consumption running around 55 million kwh, the project ran
aground because of the high cost of electricity in Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai Province, on the other hand, which is rich in
electricity, crude salt, and cheap labor, could provide an ideal
site for such high energy consumption, according to Shen
Kangsheng, who is responsible for the project.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai's lower cost of electricity could help cut 17 million
yuan (about two million US dollars) from the project's annual
expenditures, Shen added.
</P>
<P>
So far, Xiangshui County has signed contracts with two
state-owned enterprises in Qinghai to establish a publically-owned
company for the project, and five million US dollars' worth of
equipment is on its way to Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai also established a favorable policy for the project,
including status as foreign-funded enterprises, and priority in
electricity use.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Foreign Foreign Trade Firms to Be Launched in Pudong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China will soon have the first
group of joint venture foreign trade companies operating in Pudong
Development Zone in Shanghai, the country's experimental base for
new ideas and policies.
</P>
<P>
The foreign partners have all been carefully chosen from
countries or regions representing different international markets,
according to Hu Wei, deputy director of the Administrative
Committee of Pudong New Development Zone.
</P>
<P>
Hu did not disclose the number or names of the foreign
partners, but said the joint foreign trade ventures will be
officially launched once the State Council grants the final
permission.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade companies and enterprises with export licenses
are competing to get a foothold in Pudong, as they can enjoy
preferential policies in taxes, export quotas and bank credit.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last month 45 domestic foreign trade firms and
manufacturer-exporter enterprises had set up subsidiaries in
Pudong, and another 100 are expected to become the newcomers this
year, since the central government eased preconditions for opening
such subsidiaries in the zone.
</P>
<P>
Starting from this year, foreign trade firms with annual export
volume exceeding 50 million US dollars and manufacturer-exporters
enterprises with annual export volume surpassing 10 million US
dollars will be allowed to open subsidiaries in Pudong. Half of
the demanded volumes is set for companies from ethnic minority
regions and economically less developed areas.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend nine foreign trade franchises signed cooperative
agreements with six banks in Pudong which will give them
priorities in credits.

<P>
YINCHUAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China, one of the
four state commercial banks, has tried various means to help
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region develop its
economy.
</P>
<P>
The BOC has handled the bulk of Ningxia's non-trade and trade
settlements, allowing it to expand business relations to more
than 50 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
By providing such services as helping raising funds for foreign
trade, discounting bills denominated in foreign exchange,
guaranteeing delivery of goods, and hedging trade in foreign
exchange, the BOC has helped Ningxia earn 920 million US dollars
in foreign exchanges from exports over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Last year it arranged 660 million yuan in loans for
foreign-funded enterprises in Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
Because of more than one billion yuan the BOC raised on
regional and national capital markets, Ningxia's bearing and
chemical industries benefited, and profits in ten local foreign
trade firms surged by more than 60 percent over the previous
year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Legislators Asked Not to Meddle in Dominican Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTO DOMINGO, June 27 (xinhua) -- The Central Electoral Board
(CEB) of the Dominican Republic today asked U.S. legislators to
keep out of the country's electoral process.
</P>
<P>
CEB President Cesar Estrella Sadhala told the press that "the
only thing we demand is to respect our internal situation."
</P>
<P>
The second round of voting to elect the president of the
country will be held on June 30 after two presidential candidates
failed to get more than 50 percent of the votes in the first round
on May 16.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Washington said that a group of U.S. legislators
sent a letter to President Bill Clinton several days ago
requesting the U.S. government to ensure that the Dominican
elections are "honest and clean."
</P>
<P>
Estrella Sadhala said that the CEB has developed all the
necessary guarantees for the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
The concerns shown by the U.S. legislators are understandable
only if they are not intruding upon the internal affairs of this
country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Candidates Jose Farncisco Pena Gomez of the Dominican
Revolutionary Party and Leonel Fernandez Reyna of the Dominican
Liberation Party will vie for the presidency in the second round.
The winner will succeed President Joaquin Balaguer who has been
president for 22 of the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Balaguer agreed to cut his seventh term by half and not to seek
re-election to end accusations that he won the 1994 election
through fraud.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with President Balaguer on Wednesday,
U.S. Ambassador Donna Hrinak said that her government would take
"strict neutrality" on Sunday's voting.

MANILA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Foreign Secretary
Domingo Siazon Jr. will visit Singapore on July 6 to 8 and hold
bilateral talks with Singapore foreign minister Shanmugan
Jayakumar.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit to Singapore by the Philippine foreign

</P>
<P>
According to the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs,

According to a report from the Foreign Affairs Department, at
least 50 Filipino maids are hired in Singapore every week despite

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand trade balance
improved in May with trade balance trend moving in an upward
direction, according to figures released by the Statistics NZ
today.
</P>
<P>
The better situation was due to higher exports and unchanged
imports in April and May.
</P>
<P>
Actual exports in May rose by 7.8 percent over the same month
in 1995 to a record high of 2.25 billion NZ dollars (1.5 billion
US dollars), resulting in a trade surplus in the three months to
May of 767 million dollars (514 million US dollars). It was the
largest monthly surplus since May 1994.
</P>
<P>
Exports of dairy produce, fruit and nuts and mineral fuels all
registered increases in May, although exports of wool, wood and
wood articles were down.
</P>
<P>
But Statistics NZ said the trade balance for the year ending
May 1996 was still 482 million NZ dollars (323 million US dollars)
in deficit, compared with a deficit of 309 million NZ dollars
(207 million US dollars) in the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin to Increase Cooperation with Hongkong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, the largest port city in
north China, is planning on making itself into an ideal place for
Hongkong investment, Ye Disheng, the city's vice-mayor, said
recently.
</P>
<P>
The two cities complement each other economically and should
strengthen the business tie, the vice-mayor said, adding that this
will help Hong Kong to accelerate the northward movement of its
investment before and after 1997, when Hong Kong returns to the
motherland, the vice-mayor noted.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, Hong Kong investment in Tianjin has
increased 20 percent annually, and now totals 4.5 billion US
dollars, accounting for 35 percent of the total overseas
investment in the city.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is Hong Kong's third largest trade partner, with trade
volume reaching 3.1 billion US dollars last year. So Tianjin
attaches great importance to Hong Kong and has set up trade and
business offices there.
</P>
<P>
"As an economic center on the Bohai rim, Tianjin is enhancing
its status in the economic framework of north China. It is a
short-cut to markets in north China. This is already the consensus
of Hongkong's business community," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"It is now building itself into a commercial and financial
center of north China, and needs experience from Hong Kong", he
added, explaining, "Since the tertiary trade in Tianjin is yet to
be developed, it will provide many good chances for the
development of Hong Kong investment."

MOSCOW, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Aleksandr Lebed, Russian President

including China.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, who was appointed secretary of the Security Council of

</P>

Lebed said that obviously Russia can hardly find a true
strategic partner in Europe though efforts to that end should
continue.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that Russia should instead strengthen its trade,
production, scientific, military, political and cultural ties with
the Asian and Pacific countries.
</P>
<P>
Developing ties with the Asia-Pacific region is not only a
political need for Russia's security strategy, he added, it is an
economic necessity as well.
</P>
<P>
Cooperating with the Asian and Pacific countries will enable
Russia to pursue an independent and effective foreign policy in
dealing with any other geopolitical systems, Lebed added.

<HEADLINE> "Telephone Hot-line Services" Booming in Southern China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Telephone hotlines have
mushroomed in Guangzhou since the city's mayor launched the first
ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
With 40 phones for every 100 people in China's booming city,
the telephone has become part of everyday life for most folk.
</P>
<P>
As the number of public and private telephones continues to
rise various "telephone hot-line services" have flourished
throughout Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
The telephone hot-line services have added interest and new
charm to the economically-developed city.
</P>
<P>
The city mayor hot-line opened in 1986 and now receives an
average 40 to 50 calls every day.
</P>
<P>
Most of the calls voice public opinions on government work, and
various topics, such as environmental protection, water and
electricity supply and urban construction.
</P>
<P>
The city mayor hot-line is warmly appreciated by Guangzhou
citizens, since many public suggestions have been taken on board
by the city government.
</P>
<P>
Settlement of problems and answers to questions raised by
citizens are usually published in "Guangzhou Daily", which
encourages local people to voice their opinions and encourage
cadres to work for the good of the public.
</P>
<P>
Another popular telephone hot-line is called "news special
line" run by Guangdong People's Broadcasting Station. The program
is broadcast every day between 07:40 and 08:00.
</P>
<P>
People can directly contact the host of the program and voice
their opinions on public affairs.
</P>
<P>
There are also telephone hot-lines specially for youngsters to
help them resolve mental depression.
</P>
<P>
Other hot-lines concerning living, feeding, clothing and
travelling have sprung up like mushrooms.

<HEADLINE> Former Champion Edberg's Tennis Swansang Ended in Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WIMBLEDON, ENGLAND, June 27 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Two-times
Wimbledon Champion Stepfan Edberg's cherished hope of winning his
last Wimbledon title ended in bitterness when the thirty-year old
tennis ace was defeated by his compatriot Mikael Tillistrom at the
second round of the Wimbledon Championships.
</P>
<P>
Edberg, who was the junior Wimbledon Champion in 1983, had
hoped to conclude his tennis carrer by a final win at the most
influential tennis tournament in the world.
</P>
<P>
But Tillistrom had made a bitter surprise earlier by beating
the Swedish tennis hero 4-6, 6-4, 7-6, 6-4 at the second round of
the man's singles events.
</P>
<P>
Tillstrom, playing his first Wimbledon, said he knew his win
would upset lots of tennis fans back home, but he was still
delighted at his victory.
</P>
<P>
Edberg, who had also won two Austrialian Open and two
U.S. Grand Slam titles, said after the match, "It is a tough game,
but it has to end at some point. Today it was the day."
</P>
<P>
"It's not the end of the world. I did what I could and it
wasn't enough today," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that he would plough some of the millions of
dollars he has earned from the game back into a foundation for
young Swedish players.
</P>
<P>
Defending Champion Pete Sampras defeated his arch-rival
Australia's promising rising tennis star Mark Philippousis 7-6,
6-4, 6-4 and sailed comfortably into the third round of the
Championships.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Austrialian player, who defeated the world
number one Sampras in the Austrialian Open earlier this year, put
away 28 aces in today's game, but he failed to display the range
of shots Sampras has used to such effect to win the last three
Wimbledon man's singles titles plus four other Grand Slam titles.
</P>
<P>
Micheal Stich of Germany, Wimbledon Champion in 1991, also
entered the next round by beating Japanese player Shuzo Matsuika
7-6, 6-4, 6-7, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles matched played earlier today, top seed
and defending champion Graf continued her winning streak by
enjoying a walkover into the third round.
</P>
<P>
Following the unexpected defeat of second seed Monica Seles on
Wednesday, another two women top seeds were defeated at the
infamous Court Two known as "graveyard".
</P>
<P>
The women's eighth seed Lindsay Davenport of the United States
and 10th seeded Bulgarian Magdalena Maleeva were defeated by
unseeded players in straight sets.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The 1994 Brazil World Cup
star Romario was the absence from the list of 18 players named to
Brazil's soccer team for the Atlanta Olympics, according to a
local report.
</P>
<P>
But another star Bebeto is going to the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
Coach Mario Zagallo had made it clear that he would not take
both Romario and Bebeto. Each team is allowed only three players
over 23, and the two strikers are over the age limit.
</P>
<P>
The report said: Romario, voted the world's best player in
1994, was hurt by erratic play and an attitude problem. While
Bebeto was a model of good behavior on and off the field.
</P>
<P>
Aside from Bebeto, Zagalo, Luizao and Ronaldinho - a World Cup
veteran at 20. Caio, an all-star forward from Italy's
Internazionale, didn't make the list.

Dalian, a showcase of north China's openness to outside
enterprises, claims the most Sino-Japanese ventures. The Tokyo and
Mitsubishi Bank, the Industrial Bank of Japan, The Fuji Bank and
the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank are among the first foreign banks that
have landed in the city.
</P>
<P>
In addition to serving foreign-funded enterprises, these
foreign financial institutions have brought in much-needed
capital. By the end of May, outstanding loans from foreign banks
exceeded one billion US dollars, and the figure has grown by about
30 million US dollars each month since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates show that Liaoning, as China's oldest
industrial base, which holds one-tenth of the country's large and
medium-sized state enterprises, needs at least 300 billion yuan
(about 36.14 billion US dollars) to cover the costs of technical
upgrading in next five years.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said they hope to receive cooperation from
foreign financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
At present, most foreign bank agencies are located in Shenyang
and Dalian, but they have begun exploring business opportunities
outside the two cities.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign banks are conducting feasibility studies for
financing the renovation of the Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation,
one of the state's largest steel producers, which also acts as a
consultant for the sale of stock for the province's express
highways.

<HEADLINE> Rural Women in Zhejiang Enjoy Reading Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Xu Aijin, 61, kept murmuring,
"Reading books is good! Reading books is good!" when she was
handed a shiny school badge and a set of books from her teacher
with an agricultural correspondence school.
</P>
<P>
Xu, a former cadre in charge of women's affairs, received the
badge and books at the opening ceremony of a six-month class on
household management for women, in early March.
</P>
<P>
Xu and some 30 classmates celebrated the beginning of their
class in a classroom in Chengxiang town, Xiaoshan city, in
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
There are an increasing number of rural women in the province,
like Xu, who were bound to household chores in the past, but who
are now attending various schools and participating in various
training courses.
</P>
<P>
In Fuyang City, some 100 rural women got graduation
certificates on "household management" recently after attending
classes run by local women's unions and agricultural
correspondence schools.
</P>
<P>
There they learned management of household affairs, health
care, cosmetology, and many other subjects.
</P>
<P>
This year, the six classes attracted more than 200 rural women
within two days.
</P>
<P>
There were more than 6,100 young illiterate people in Changshan
county in western Zhejiang Province, about 80 percent of whom were
rural women. The county has set up 170 classes to wipe out
illiteracy since the beginning of the year.

JINAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province will
actively support the development of its high-tech industry so that
the sector can produce ten percent of the province's annual total

<HEADLINE> 30 Salt Hills Founded in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region has found 30 salt hills within its boundary,
with salt reserves forecast at 30 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources the hills are located between Kuqa
and Wensu counties, extending for over 200 km. The highest of them
tops 200 meters, and the largest covers an area of 16 sq km.
</P>
<P>
Initial surveys show that the salt hills are very rich in salt
content, reaching as high as 70 to 90 percent. And the salt layers
reach as thick as 200 m.
</P>
<P>
Scientists explained that Kuqa areas in Xinjiang were covered
by a vast sea 50 million years ago. The arid climatic condition
and the receding of sea water ushered in the appearance of salt
fields. And salt hills came into being because of strong crustal
movement some three million years ago.

<HEADLINE> Muslims, Croats Take Small Step in Mending Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Muslims and Croats have
agreed on a timetable to shore up their shaky federation, U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State John Kornblum said today.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum also told a press conference here that the United
States would not accept conditions put forward by Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic for his stepping down from power.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Kornblum chaired a meeting attended by Muslim
and Croat leaders to discuss problems faced by the federation
which was brokered by Washington as the cornerstone of the Dayton
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The participants agreed that intensive work is needed to
implement fully the federation agreements of Dayton and
Washington," Kornblum said.
</P>
<P>
"Too many commitments remain unfulfilled, reflecting the
failure of the parties to muster the political will necessary to
achieve and implement difficult compromises," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the timetable, Muslims and Croats will have to agree by
July 5 on the wording of a joint defense law and its failure will
continue to block the U.S. proposed training and equipping program
for the federation army, Kornblum said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to settle the dispute concerning the
future government of Sarajevo by the end of next week, to set up a
unified payments system in an unspecified time and strive for the
transfer to the federation of all functions assigned to it by
previous agreements to be "completed promptly."
</P>
<P>
Kornblum was in Belgrade Wednesday to press for the removal of
Karadzic from the political scene, while Karadzic said that he
would resign if the international community guaranteed the
"statehood" of Republika Srpska and gave Brcko to the Serb entity.
</P>
<P>
"Both of those conditions are really in violation of the peace
agreement and we certainly would not accept," Kornblum said.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Karadzic is not in any position to levy condition. It is
exactly the opposite. He must quickly bow to pressure of the
international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum said that the United States was taking a "step by step
approach," although it would like to see Karadzic for trial in the
Hague as he was indicted for war crimes by the international
tribunal there.
</P>
<P>
"The most important step now is for him to be out of power, to
have no governmental influence and no ability to undermine the
implementation of the peace agreement as he has been doing,"
Kornblum said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace agreement reached last year by Bosnia's
three warring factions, the country consists of two entities --
the Bosnian (Muslim-Croat) Federation and Republika Srpska --
being linked by a central government.
</P>
<P>
But nationalists, particularly among Serbs and Croats, are
pushing for the partition of the country, which the United states
and its European allies fear will not endanger the peace process
but may also rekindle the war.

industrial countries issued the Declaration on Terrorism here
today, denouncing the latest bomb explosion which killed 19
Americans and wounded many others.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was issued following a working dinner hosted by
French President Jacques Chirac in honor of the other G-7 leaders
-- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien, U.S. President Bill Clinton, Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi, Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and
British Prime Minister John Major -- as well as Jacques Santer,
president of the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
The working dinner marked the opening of the 22nd summit of the

</P>
<P>
While condemning the "barbarous and unjustifiable act" on Saudi
Arabia's Dhahran, which took the life of a large number of
American citizens and injured hundreds of innocent people as well
as other recent terrorist outrages, the declaration expressed
"wholehearted solidarity with the United States and Saudi Arabia
in their terrible ordeal."
</P>

justice," it added.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 leaders expressed their common resolve to "unite our
efforts and our determination to fight terrorism by all legal
means" and called upon all countries to deny all support to
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also urged all countries to thwart the
activities of terrorists and their supporters, including
fund-raising, the planning of terrorist acts, procurement of
weapons, calling for violence, and incitements to commit terrorist
acts. "Special attention should be paid to the threat of
utilization of nuclear, biological and chemical materials as well
as toxic substances, for terrorist purposes," it underlined.
</P>
<P>
Following the working dinner, French President Chirac and U.S.
President Clinton jointly held a press briefing to announce a

<HEADLINE> Jiang: China Ready to Forge Better Ties With Norway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSLO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today that China and Norway are ready to work together to
achieve greater achievements so as to open a fresh chapter of
bilateral relations in the next century.
</P>
<P>
At a welcome banquet held by Norwegian King Herald V in his
honor, Jiang, who arrived here today for a three-day state visit,
said China and Norway have no conflict of fundamental interests
and their economies are highly complementary with respective
advantages.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Norway is one of the first Western
countries to establish diplomatic relations with New China and
over the past 40 years and more, the friendly relations and
cooperation between the two countries have registered substantial
growth in the political, economic, scientific, technological,
cultural and other fields.
</P>
<P>
By welcoming the Chinese guests, King Herald V said the first
visit to Norway by a Chinese head of state indicates that both
sides are working hard to further develop bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The king said that although China and Norway have great
differences in the size of territory, culture and history, they
have many common interests in maintaining world peace and
stability. "Our two countries are continuing excellent cooperation
in the U.N. and other international forums," he added.
</P>
<P>
The king also noted that China's economic reform and opening up
have made itself a major cooperative partner in the world.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the importance to keeping ties with Norway, Jiang
said, "The Chinese people are ready to work together with the
Norwegian people to score even greater achievements across the
board in advancing Sino-Norwegian friendship and cooperation
during the fifth decade of their diplomatic relations, thus
opening a fresh chapter of Sino-Norwegian relations in the 21st
century."
</P>
<P>
"It serves the fundamental interests of the two peoples to
further develop bilateral cooperation and exchanges in all areas,
particularly the economic, trade, scientific and technological
fields," the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that right now, the Chinese people are working
hard to build socialism and opening to the outside world. "A
stable, developing and increasingly prosperous cooperation exists
between China and all the other countries in the world including
Norway," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian king, who visited China in 1985, said
Sino-Norwegian economic relations are characterized by sustained
development and extensive cooperation, and an increased exchange
of visits between the two sides have manifested the enormous
potential in developing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are now strengthening cooperation in navigation,
ship-building, chemical industry, pharmacy, water conservancy, oil
exploration and development, and environmental protection, the
king said.
</P>
<P>
"Our interest in China is not restricted in politics, economy
and trade, but more extensive to include its history and rich
culture," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He also said Jiang's visit will lead to further consolidation
of Norwegian-Chinese friendly relations and deepened mutual
understanding between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Norway is the second leg of President Jiang's current European
and central Asian tour. He has already visited Spain and will
continue his trip to Romania, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and
Kazakhstan.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Meets With Norwegian Parliament President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSLO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today that strengthening contacts between the legislative
institutions of China and Norway plays an important role in the
enhancement of understanding between the two peoples and bilateral
cooperative relations.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Norwegian parliament President Kristi Kolle
Grondahl in the parliament building, the Chinese president said
that right now the development of Sino-Norwegian relations is
gaining momentum with more and more cooperation and exchanges in
various areas between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the legislative bodies of the two countries will keep
and further develop the existing good relations, and I welcome
more Norwegian parliament members and statesmen to visit China and
see with their own eyes the real situation and the changes that
have taken place in China in recent years, which will help
increase mutual understanding and promote stable and long-term
development of the Sino-Norwegian relations," Jiang told Grondahl.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian parliament president agreed to what Jiang had
said. She noted that although her country is small, Norway and
China have built constructive relations. "The senior leaders of
our two countries should increase direct exchange to enhance
mutual understanding," she said.
</P>
<P>
Grondahl also said she and Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem
Brundtland visited China last year separately, which had achieved
good results. She expressed the hope that Chairman of the Chinese
National People's Congress Qiao Shi would visit Norway as early as
possible to continue their talks.
</P>
<P>
Jiang echoed Grondahl's remarks, saying direct exchange and
contact between the state leaders of the two countries have an
irreplaceable role in pushing forward bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president flew into Oslo earlier today from Spain
to pay a three-day state visit to Norway. He will held talks with
Norwegian Prime Minister Brundtland Friday over issues of mutual
concern.

<HEADLINE> UN Officials Inspect Flood-Stricken Regions in Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The resident representative of the
U.N. Development Program (UNDP) said U.N. officials have inspected
the Yemeni disaster areas in the flood-inflicted provinces and are
compiling a report on the damages, prior to addressing an appeal
for urgent humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference at the premises of the U.N.
Information Center here, the resident representative said
representatives of the U.N. specialized agencies and other
U.N. departments, who have been already in Yemen since last week,
are estimating the grave damages and losses caused by the
torrential rains that swept through several Yemeni provinces from
June 14 to 16, where 1.9 million people live.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary reports said the floods in eastern Yemen caused by
heavy rains have killed more than 150 people and injured many
others, destroyed many houses and buildings as well as hospitals,
roads, embankments, equipment, telephone lines and water
facilities, and swept away thousands of hectares of agricultural
land and crops.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni government had made an appeal to the international
community for assistance.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. World Food Program (WFP) has extended urgent food
assistance to the victims the floods, the UNDP 150,000
U,S. dollars, UNESCO 50,000 dollars, and WHO 61,000 dollar-worth
of medicine.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and
Qatar have sent tents, medicine, foodstuffs and blankets for their
Yemeni brothers, and pledged to provide financial aid and
assistance in kind.

<TEXT>
<P>
Lyon (France), June 27 (Xinhua) --The 22nd Summit of the G-7
industrial nations opened here this evening after French President
Jacques Chirac hosting a working dinner in honour of the
participating leaders.
</P>
<P>
During the dinner, the leaders are expected to discuss the
Russian situation and combat terrorism, and thus delivering a
clear message to Russia for backing its economic reform process.
</P>
<P>
German Prime Minister Helmut Kohl, Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien, U.S. President Bill Clinton, Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi, Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and
British Prime Minister John Major attended the opening occasion.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 Lyon Summit will discuss a wide range of issues from
the global economic growth, financial stabilization, to the
Russian situation and combating against drug trafficking and
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
French President Chirac who had bilateral talks with the G-7
European leaders during their European Union Summit at Florence,
Italy, held separate talks with leaders of the United States,
Japan, and Canada this afternoon, giving a final okay for the
Summit's agenda.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton, who arrived here yesterday evening, has a
busy schedule this afternoon. In addition to the meeting with
President Chirac, Clinton also had bilateral consultations with
British Prime minister Major and Japanese Prime Minister
Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
Just on the eve of the G-7 Lyon Summit, a bomb explosion in
Saudi Arabia killed 19 people. Before departure from the United
States, Clinton made a strongly-worded statement, denouncing the
act and vowing to fight against terrorism. "We will not rest in
our efforts to find who is responsible for this outrage, to pursue
them and to punish them. Anyone who attacks one American attacks
every American, and we protect and defend our own."
</P>
<P>
It was learned here that the G-7 Lyon Summit is expected to
adopt a 40-point program to fight international crime, including a
"nowhere-to-hide" extradition agreement and new restrictions on
international financial transactions that could help combat
terrorism.

<HEADLINE> New York City Set to Tighten Begging Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 27 (Xinhua) -- New York City, which has been
plagued by insistent or menacing panhandlers and beggars, is
expected to have an anti-begging law which will go into effect
this summer, New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to this effect, unanimously approved by the
Council's Public Safety Committee on Wednesday, is expected to be
passed by the full Council and signed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani
next month.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed bill, convicted beggars would be guilty of a
misdemeanor and would face up to 20 days in jail or a fine of up
to 250 u.s. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner Howard Safir was quoted by the newspaper as
saying that the bill would enable police officers to respond to
situations they now either have no jurisdiction over or can
enforce only as minor code violations that the most menacing
panhandlers do not take seriously.
</P>
<P>
"This is a reasonable, enforceable law to protect the majority
of the public," Safir added.
</P>
<P>
The City has already had laws, banning begging and peddling on
subways, but in recent months they have seldom been enforced.
Begging, which was eliminated last year, is back again. They hawk
batteries, chewing gum and cheap plastic toys. Or they tell
stories of being rubbed or having their homes and possessions
destroyed by fire. On weekends, when tourists and shoppers fill
the subway cars, they come out in force.
</P>
<P>
"They come and go depending on the intensity of the police
crackdown, " a train conductor said.

<HEADLINE> WB Rport: Remarkable Progress in Transition Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) --The transition economies have
made great strides over a very short time toward market economies,
but the process is not over, says the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to the 241-page "1996 World Development Report: From
Plan to Market," which is published here today, in many countries,
the key steps in moving to a market economy--liberalizing markets
and trade, creating new businesses, achieving price stability, and
moving towards clear property rights-- are well advanced and
provide important lessons for late reformers. With continued and
sustained reforms, the transition countries can achieve successful
long-term economic growth considerably above world average, the
report asserts.
</P>
<P>
The report, the 19th World Development Report (WDR) by the
World Bank, assesses 28 countries in Central and Eastern Europe,
the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union (NIS), and
China, Mongolia and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The WDR highlights the successes and difficulties facing the
diverse transition economies. Poland, for example, could be termed
as "big bang" transition, had a 7 percent GDP growth rate in 1995,
due to private sector growth of 15 percent and state sector
contraction of only 3 percent. Poland liberalized with one "big
bang", freeing 90 percent of prices, eliminating trade barriers
and making its currency convertible in 1990. While China, which is
regarded as "gradualism" style, has soared from the world's 32nd
to the 10th largest exporter-- sparked by opening to international
trade and investment, and the creation of 100 million new jobs in
non-state industry. The report also underlined that living
standards have risen sharply in the East Asian transition
economies, lifting almost 200 million people out of extreme
poverty during the period.
</P>
<P>
Moving away from the big-bang versus gradualism dichotomy, the
Report points out, that initial conditions as well as policies,
are very important. "In every case, it concludes, "what matters is
the breadth of the policy reforms attempted and the consistency
with which they are maintained."
</P>
<P>
The next stage of reforms in East Asia will be more complex and
difficult as reforms move to tackle the problems of loss making
state sectors, which will likely have to be reduced in size, and
the institutional underpinnings of their economies. Continuing
fiscal reform, the WDR says, is one priority. The reforms have
also shifted to the banking and legal systems and corporate
governance and accountability in all sectors to avoid an ownership
vacuum. Social policy reforms are vital also, to sustain access in
poor areas and disentangle benefits from state enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Congress Approves Tougher Penalties for Church Arson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congress completed
action Thursday on legislation to stiffen penalties for arson in
places of worship and enhance federal authorities to investigate
such cases as the rash of fires at black churches in the South.
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill approved 98-0 on Wednesday was accepted by the
House Thursday on a voice vote, sending the measure to President
Bill Clinton for his signature.
</P>
<P>
The bill would double maximum prison terms to 20 years for
anyone convicted of church arson and increase the statute of
limitations for prosecution from five years to seven. It also
envisions more funds for federal law enforcement agencies,
designed to help them train local and state authorities in
investigating suspected arson at churches.
</P>
<P>
The leading Senate sponsors were North Carolina Republican
Lauch Faircloth and Democrat Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
The House approved an earlier version on a unanimous vote.
</P>
<P>
The legislation represents Congress' response to fires that
have damaged or destroyed more than 40 predominantly black
churches in the South in the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has ordered stepped up investigations by federal
agencies, and announced on Wednesday an arson-prevention
initiative by the Federal Emergency Management Agency "to protect
houses of worship and prevent future fires."
</P>
<P>
At a White House meeting with Southern governors last week,
Clinton said he sees no evidence of a single national conspiracy
in the burnings, but he said most have been "racially motivated."

<HEADLINE> No Deal on Nuclear Test Ban to Be Struck Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators at the Geneva-based
Conference on Disarmament said today that they would not be able
to strike a deal on a global nuclear test ban treaty Friday as
expected because they are still widely divided on some key issues.
</P>
<P>
Jaap Ramaker, the Dutch ambassador who chairs the negotiations,
suggested this afternoon that the current negotiating session be
concluded Friday as scheduled, when he will submit a revised clean
draft treaty to summarize the outcome negotiated over the past two
and half years, as well as possible compromises.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested to the afternoon meeting that negotiators
take his new draft back to capitals for further study and return
on July 29, as the disarmament conference begins the third part of
its 1996 session, to decide whether it could be submitted for
signature at the 51st session of the UN General Assembly slated for
September.
</P>
<P>
His suggestion, however, aroused controversies as many
negotiators raised the question whether the draft treaty text
would still be open for further amendments or it would be just
submitted on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.
</P>
<P>
Both at the meeting and when asked by reporters afterwards,
Ramaker declined to speculate on what the next step would exactly
be. He argued that what he wanted to do was to let the capitals
make a study into his draft text and make the judgement.
</P>
<P>
A decision on the issue is expected to be made when the current
negotiating session will hold its last meeting Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Some disarmament observers here believe that since the problem
is so serious as far as national security interest is concerned,
the negotiations will for sure be restarted in July.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators emerging from a plenary meeting this morning said
opinions on some key issues were so divided that it was virtually
impossible to find the consensus required for a treaty Friday,
short of the wish of majority of the participants.
</P>
<P>
The main sticking points of the negotiations now are widely
believed to be the entry-into-force of the treaty and how to
trigger on-site inspections.
</P>
<P>
Under the current draft treaty, the five declared nuclear
powers -- the United States, Russia, France, Britain and China --
as well as the three so-called "threshold states" of India, Israel
and Pakistan must agree before the treaty can entry into force.
</P>
<P>
The threshold states are those suspected of having or being
close to having a nuclear-bomb capability.
</P>
<P>
India said last Thursday that it would not sign a nuclear test
ban treaty unless it required the destruction of existing nuclear
weapons in a specified period of time.
</P>
<P>
India also rejected language that would require it to ratify
the treaty before it could go into effect.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been holding out in Geneva for a
less-demanding set of requirement to allow the treaty to take
effect.
</P>
<P>
At Washington's urging, Ramaker tried a compromise on the issue
last week. He proposed adding a provision that allows the treaty
to take effort in five years if 75 countries have ratified it,
effectively preventing any move by a single nation to indefinitely
block the treaty.
</P>
<P>
But Britain and Russia are strongly against the idea, stressing
that the treaty must be accepted by all the above-mentioned eight
countries for it to have any important meaning.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of on-site inspections, Western countries led by
the United States want a mechanism which could quickly trigger
such an inspection to investigate possible treaty violations, for
example by the approval of a simple majority in the executive
committee of the future treaty organization.
</P>
<P>
Other countries, particularly Russia, China and some other
nations in the developing world, strongly demand a two-third
majority to approve on-site inspections. They stress that the
on-site inspection is politically too sensitive and only a more
cautious mechanism can prevent possible abuses.

<HEADLINE> African Insurance Industry Remains Insignificant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The small-scaled insurance industry
in Africa is shrinking and its contribution to economic
development remains insignificant, a senior industry executive
said today.
</P>
<P>
Total premium generated by the industry in Africa was 18
billion US dollars in 1993, accounting for only 0.98 percent of
the world's total, said Bakary Kamara, Managing Director of
Africa Re-Insurance Corporation, in Abuja, capital of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the insurance industry's premium
income was just about 1.4 percent of Africa's average Gross
Domestic Product, compared with the world's average of 7.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the reinsurance sub-sector, Kamara said, there are 20
indegenous companies operating in Africa currently. But their
capacity to take up reinsurance risk has been inadequate. As a
result, substantial part of reinsurance has to be offered to
foreign companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, an average 34 percent of African reinsurance
premiums has been transferred outside the continent, as against
the world ceded ratio of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the problem to the slow economic growth in
Africa, the lack of market innovation and professional
management, and insufficient capitalisation, among others.
</P>
<P>
The way out, he said, lies in recapitalisation of and
organisational restructuring of firms, human resource
development, practicing cost-effective management and effective
use of management information systems. enditem

last week. He proposed adding a provision that allows the treaty
to take effort in five years if 75 countries have ratified it,
effectively preventing any move by a single nation to indefinitely
block the treaty.
</P>
<P>
But Britain and Russia lobbied heavily against the idea last
week, stressing that the treaty must be accepted by all the
above-mentioned eight countries for it to have any important
meaning.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of on-site inspections, Western countries led by
the United States want a mechanism which could quickly trigger
such an inspection to investigate possible treaty violations, for
example by the approval of a simple majority in the executive
committee of the future treaty organization.
</P>
<P>
Other countries, particularly Russia, China and some other
nations in the developing world, strongly demand a two-third
majority to approve on-site inspections. They stress that the
on-site inspection is politically highly sensitive and only a more
cautious mechanism can prevent possible abuses.

<HEADLINE> Perry to Leave for Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry will leave for Saudi Arabia this weekend to show the U.S.
determination of pursuing its mission in the Persian Gulf despite
the Tuesday truck bombing that killed 19 Americans.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior defense official today, Perry will arrive
in the kingdom early Saturday and meet with FBI investigators who
are combing through the site of the attack in the King Abdul-Aziz
Air Base near Dhahran.
</P>
<P>
He will then have a meeting with U.S. military leaders and
Saudi officials to discuss how to tighten security actions at U.S.
facilities in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
He will convey to the Saudi leaders when holding talks with
them in Jeddah the message that the United States has "not been
frightened... and not deterred" from the U.S. mission of providing
security to the region, added the official.
</P>
<P>
This morning, the bodies of the 19 American servicemen were
returned to America. A C-5 cargo jet carrying the 19 coffins
arrived at about 11:30.
</P>
<P>
Responsibility for the Tuesday attack was claimed by the
"legion of the Martyr Abdullah al-Huzaifi" which said it would
strike again unless the Saudi government expelled all U.S. and
foreign troops "occupying the holy Saudi land."
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that the bombers aim at ridding the Islamic
Kingdom of Western military forces and purifying it of foreign
influence.
</P>
<P>
"Attack on foreigners, particularly Americans, is their main
objective," they say. "The message (of the bombing) to the regime
is that it can's be so much in the pocket of Western countries,
particularly the U.S."

<HEADLINE> Fight Against Hunger, Theme of World Food Summit: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The time is ripe for world
leaders to turn their attention to food security -- to address the
misery of today's hungry and to agree on the policies and actions
to ensure sustained progress towards a food-secure future for all,
a senior U.N. official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Kay Killingsworth, secretary-general for the World Food Summit,
said at a press conference that there are 800 million chronically
undernourished people, accounting for one-fifth of the total
population of the developing world.
</P>
<P>
"If decisive action is not taken, these numbers are expected to
be substantially the same in 15 years, and at that time, over half
of the hungry will be in Africa," she said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the world's grain reserves have fallen below the
level considered necessary to guarantee global food security.
Grain prices have soared and the low-income, food-deficit
developing countries have paid out an additional 3.4 billion
dollars this past season for their cereal imports.
</P>
<P>
Though many countries have achieved impressive progress in food
production, the world population today is 2.5 times larger than in
1945 when the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) was founded.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, by 2030 the planet may have 3 billion more
people to nourish. "We cannot relax our search for sustainable
ways of producing the food which this expanding population will
require," she said.
</P>
<P>
On the World Food Summit to be held in Rome from November 13 to
17, she said that its objective is to renew the commitment of the
world's leaders to achieving universal food security.
</P>
<P>
"This will be the first time, since FAO was founded 50 years
ago, that such a meeting is convened at the highest political
level -- that of heads of state and government," she said.
