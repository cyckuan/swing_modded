   WASHINGTON _ The heated accusations of monopoly, the lively
e-mail flavored with capitalist aggression and the spirited
testimony alleging and denying misconduct came to a close Thursday
as the last witness stepped off the stand in the Microsoft
antitrust trial, eight months after proceedings began.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft trial is by no means over, but it sharply shifts
gears as the daily theater in the courtroom gives way to a more
sober weighing of facts and law. ``Now the showmanship ends and the
legal maneuvering really begins,'' observed Andrew Gavil, a
professor at the Howard University law school.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the points in the daily courtroom drama went to the
Justice Department and the 19 states suing Microsoft Corp.,
alleging that it illegally used its dominance to thwart
competition. Led by trial lawyer David Boies, the government team
caught Microsoft's witnesses off guard again and again, presenting
them with embarrassing e-mails or previous statements that appeared
to undermine their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was no exception, as the government introduced an
e-mail from Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, that appeared to
contradict a central defense contention: that America Online was in
a position to challenge Microsoft's dominance of operating systems
for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Even William Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel, has found the
government performance impressive, if not convincing. Since the
start of the trial, Neukom notes that he has fielded expressions of
concern that things are going badly for the company from many of
his colleagues, even his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has put on a great performance,'' he said,
``but it does not add up to a solid antitrust case. It's all fluff
legally.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Klein, assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice
Department's antitrust division, counters that the evidence and
testimony presented in court has been occasionally entertaining but
consistently incriminating. It adds up to a detailed and convincing
portrait, Klein said, of ``Microsoft's ability and willingness to
do whatever is necessary in using its market power to protect its
monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal reckoning that matters, however, will be made by Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson, who will rule in this trial without a
jury. Both Microsoft and the government will make further written
and oral arguments over the summer and fall.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson must then comb through the mountains of evidence to try
to answer one essential question: What are the appropriate legal
restraints on the behavior of a powerful company in a dynamic
high-technology industry?
</P>
<P>
   The issue extends well beyond the Microsoft case, and the stakes
are high. The ruling could set ground rules for competition in the
modern economy, affecting companies and consumers alike for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The legal guideposts to help Jackson reach his decision,
antitrust experts say, are not clear-cut. The major antitrust
rulings over the last two decades are few, and they mostly involve
mundane businesses including ski resorts in Colorado, a rural Ohio
newspaper, a bowling alley in New Jersey and an egg processor in
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the plaintiffs brought a very traditional
antitrust suit. The government says Microsoft repeatedly and
illegally used its market power to thwart new competition
represented by the rise of the Internet, especially software for
browsing the World Wide Web. With exclusionary contracts and
threats, Microsoft, according to the government, used its market
power to defend its monopoly product _ the Windows operating
system, the software that serves as the central nervous system of
90 percent of the personal computers sold today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is mainly an old-fashioned contract case,'' said Herbert
Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa law school and
leading antitrust scholar, who is advising the government. ``There
is nothing novel about the practices. The one thing that is novel
is that the case is in the software industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the industry context is a crucial consideration. The
software business is regarded as the forerunner of what has been
called ``the new economy'' _ a fast-moving, fluid environment in
which market leadership can be fleeting, but technology can also
hasten the concentration of market power and the creation of
monopolies. In short, new-economy theories can cut both ways in
antitrust cases. There has been plenty of talk of ``network
effects'' and ``winner-take-all markets'' from both sides in the
Microsoft trial.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Microsoft case focuses on a fast-moving,
technically complex industry complicates the legal judgment the
court must make. ``It makes the toughest issues that courts have to
deal with in antitrust cases _ determining market power, evaluating
the significance of conduct and designing remedies _ far more
difficult,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at the George
Washington University law school.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many antitrust experts who have followed the trial expect
that Jackson will side with the government on some of its many
charges against Microsoft. They base that view partly on a reading
of Jackson's behavior _openly questioning the testimony of some
Microsoft witnesses, and showing impatience with Microsoft's
lawyers _ and partly on a reading of the law, that some Microsoft
contracts with online services and personal computer manufacturers
did inhibit competition from software rivals.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge rules against Microsoft, the court will then focus
on remedies. The government says it is too early to discuss
sanctions publicly. But among the proposals being studied are
limiting the contract restraints Microsoft can place on PC makers,
forcing Microsoft to publish the price it charges PC makers for
Windows, and requiring broad disclosure of the interfaces in
Windows used by software developers to write programs. The goal,
government officials say, would be to change the balance of power
in the computer industry and limit Microsoft's leverage over
partners and rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is by no means conceding defeat in Jackson's federal
district court. But Neukom suggests that its legal strategy is to
prevail on appeal. ``The thing to remember is that we're engaged in
a legal decathlon, and we're still at an early stage,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the two sides reach a settlement, Jackson's ruling,
expected by the end of the year, will certainly be reviewed by a
federal appeals court and possibly by the Supreme Court as well. If
it goes to the Supreme Court, the Microsoft case may well not be
finally determined until 2002, legal experts say.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ Don't even bother mentioning anything about a so-called
``tainted'' championship around San Antonio's Avery Johnson.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tell him that this year's title is bogus because of the
lockout-shortened, compressed NBA season, and he'll just shrug.
Mention that should the Spurs beat the New York Knicks tonight in
Game 5 of the NBA Finals at Madison Square Garden, giving the Spurs
their first championship, their rings should come with diamonds in
the shape of an asterisk, and he'll just politely smile, nod his
head and say, ``I'll wear mine with pride.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't talk about the Chicago Bulls not being around to
defend the title that had been theirs for six of the previous eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know if they would have been able to win four in a
row,'' said Johnson of the Bulls. ``You don't know. Things happen
from year to year, and that's why (the Lakers') Derek Harper told
me, `You had better seize the moment and get it while you can.'
Injuries happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from being a real good team to winning 20 games one
year (1996-97) when Dave (Robinson) and Sean (Elliott) and all
those guys got hurt. So you don't know from one year to the next
what is in store for you. It's hard to say. Yeah, you would have
liked to have had a chance to play them, but that's not going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   There were many who doubted whether the Spurs would ever win a
title with Johnson at the helm, with Damon Stoudamire saying
exactly that. Indeed, ``the Little General'' has been treated more
like a buck private by coaches, his peers and the media.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Johnson, stung by his omission from the 1994 World Games
roster, said, ``The next thing you know, they'll be putting Avery
Johnson on the team.'' Though he later received a letter of apology
from K.J., Avery never forgot the slight.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has he forgotten the Christmas Eve in 1990 when Nuggets
coach Paul Westhead waived him. Former Spurs coaches Jerry
Tarkanian and John Lucas had little faith in the 5-11 guard from
Southern University, always on the lookout for someone better.
</P>
<P>
   No, Johnson, who has played for five NBA teams, including three
separate stints in San Antonio (and a brief time with the Rockets),
doesn't forget things like that. But he rarely talks about them,
and he never dwells on them.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who has matured into a steady point guard and honed his
jumper and flying hook shot to the point where he is capable of
scoring 20 points on any given night, just hopes that maybe winning
an NBA championship will change people's perception of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' Johnson said. ``Hopefully, I will. You know,
you're in a situation where Kevin Johnson, John Stockton and Gary
Payton were, and hey, those guys have been here quite a bit and
kind of came away finishing second.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you have a chance to at least kind of set yourself apart
from them in that area. That's a challenge. And guys who say they
don't feel that kind of challenge, they're not telling you the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   And Johnson will always tell you the truth. Always, which is one
of the reasons Johnson is so popular at the media sessions that are
a part of every player's NBA Finals routine.
</P>
<P>
   He's never dull.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say that Johnson is to hyperactivity what Jolt
Cola is to caffeinated beverages. Johnson hardly pauses when he's
on the court, one reason he was able to pile up 14 points and a
game-high 10 assists in the Spurs' 96-89 Game 4 victory. And when
Johnson is off the court, his mind and tongue rarely take a break,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Even more so now that Johnson is 48 minutes away from his first
NBA championship. Just 48 more minutes against the Knicks tonight,
and Johnson's once-impossible _ or improbable _ dream could become
a reality.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson doesn't even allow himself the luxury of thinking
about such things as rings, banners and championship parades. Not
yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is that you just try to get it out of your mind
as soon as possible,'' Johnson said. ``Once it happens, then you'll
be really, really excited, but right now there's still too much
work to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson thinks that way because he has to.
</P>
<P>
   The school of hard knocks has taught him to be wary and never
take anything for granted. So Johnson is almost afraid to let his
mind wander to the moment when the Spurs are raising a banner and a
ring is being slipped on his finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of,'' Johnson said. ``The way the Knicks are when you
watch them on film, a shot here and a shot there, and they're still
in last night's game. Maybe if they don't get in foul trouble down
in San Antonio, maybe they get a split there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. So it's a case of where I don't know if it's
afraid, but my favorite way of putting it in the playoffs is that
you just have a little fear in your attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   And should the Spurs close out the Knicks, Johnson will finally
get the credit he deserves _ plus some bragging rights when he
convenes his annual summer basketball sessions at Houston's
Westside Tennis Club. Johnson has had to take his licks from
Rockets past and present who earned championship rings in 1994 and
'95, so Johnson is looking for a little payback should he earn a
title for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' said Johnson, who lives in Sugar Land. ``I'm looking
forward to seeing Sam Cassell, let's put it like that.''

 WASHINGTON: experts say. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A crucial decision by Jackson a month before the trial began
last October determined what the courtroom proceedings became: a
sweeping portrayal of Microsoft by the government as a bullying
monopolist, supported by a parade of industry witnesses making a
litany of allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The government's original complaint, filed in May 1998, charged
that Microsoft was ``engaged in a series of anti-competitive
activities.'' But it focused largely on the company's tactics in
the browser market against Netscape Communications Corp., and
specifically on Microsoft's decision to fold its browser into its
industry-standard Windows operating system. Microsoft, the
government contended, had illegally tied a second product to its
monopoly product in a predatory effort to stifle competition and
reduce consumer choice.
</P>
<P>
   But a month later, the government's tying theory suffered a
severe blow when a federal appeals court ruled in a related case
that Microsoft should be free to blend its browser into Windows as
long as it can make a ``plausible claim'' of business efficiency or
consumer benefit from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, the Justice Department and states continued
investigating Microsoft's dealings with other companies and came up
with new evidence involving Intel, Apple Computer and others _ all
of it, the government said, fit into Microsoft's ``pattern of
behavior'' intended to stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   Over Microsoft's objections, Jackson permitted the new evidence.
Suddenly, the focus of the case widened well beyond the ``browser
wars'' to a broad, multifaceted scheme by Microsoft to protect its
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   With the retooling, the government case also acquired a broad
narrative theme that rose above the arcane details that are an
inevitable part of a high-tech antitrust trial. Whatever the legal
merits, the approach made the government's case a much more
compelling story to tell in court. So when an Intel executive
testified to a ``credible and fairly terrifying'' threat from
Microsoft, or when an America Online executive testified that it
had no choice but to adopt Microsoft's browser in return for a
coveted place on the Windows desktop, it all added detail to the
government's picture of Microsoft as an arm-twisting monopolist,
stifling competition and innovation.
</P>
<P>
   The government and states believe that they have shown not only
that Microsoft crossed the legal line repeatedly, but also that its
monopoly is fairly durable, a crucial consideration for the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think that Microsoft's operating system monopoly is
going to go away in two or three years, then we shouldn't have
brought this case,'' said Klein of the Justice Department. ``But I
obviously don't believe that. What this case is about is protecting
innovation to make a dynamic industry even more dynamic and
innovative.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft agrees that innovation is the goal, but counters that
heavy-handed antitrust enforcement is the real threat. Microsoft's
legal team insists that the law is on its side in this case,
despite the evidence presented by the government. They point to a
general drift of pro-defendant rulings in antitrust cases over the
last two decades, which speak approvingly of ``fierce,
no-holds-barred competition'' and ``the great race of
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what's in the government's case doesn't sound good,
but it doesn't rise to the level of an antitrust violation,'' said
Steven Holley, a Microsoft lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, Microsoft has leaned on two key themes. The
first, in essence, is: Our actions may have hurt some rival, but
where is the harm to competition in general and to consumers? And
the second theme, linked to the first, is: This is a vibrant
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The harm, the government and states reply, is that Microsoft's
actions would be fine if it were still a scrappy entrepreneurial
upstart rather than an industry-dominating force. ``What Microsoft
did not recognize is that it had crossed the line to become a
monopolist, so its behavior had to change,'' said Thomas Miller,
the Iowa attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft disputes the monopolist label, but argues that the
rules for dominant firms are not much different. ``We should be
competing as hard as we can for the next customer because that
behavior is good for consumers,'' Neukom of Microsoft said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, clarifying the rules of legal behavior for powerful
companies in the modern economy could well be the lasting legacy of
the Microsoft case. ``This case can really determine the boundaries
on the conduct of dominant firms for decades,'' observed Kovacic of
George Washington University.

 By FRAN BLINEBURY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ To hear the Knicks tell it, they are right back where
they want to be, dangling over the abyss by the last few strands of
a frayed rope, or, like basketball's version of Indiana Jones, now
fueled by the adrenaline rush of having to outrun that giant
boulder one more time.
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the exception of their second-round frolic past gutless
Atlanta, this is how the Knicks have spent their spring and early
summer, scrambling to poke fingers in every new leak in the hull,
which is how the flimsy ship of the No. 8 seed from the Eastern
Conference managed to make it all the way to this championship
showdown with the pedigreed Spurs. They fought and battled and
bounced back to knock off Miami in an unlikely escape, and they
practically willed their way past Larry Bird's veteran bunch from
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Now though, all the will and perseverance in the world will not
get them past the Spurs. Not unless somebody in Manhattan can find
a washing machine big enough to hold both Tim Duncan and David
Robinson and shrink them down to a much more manageable size before
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The bright orange T-shirts that were handed out for Game 4 on
Wednesday night said: ``I still believe!'' and they were supposed
to turn Madison Square Garden into the inside of a pumpkin carriage
that would take this Cinderella story onto an even more improbable
chapter as the Knicks tied the series.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't happen. Never will.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley Cup has already taken up residence for the year in
Dallas, and the NBA championship trophy will surely join it in
Texas in just a few days _ following Game 5, Game 6 or Game 7, all
of which the Knicks must win in order to prevent the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing to lose, nothing to lose,'' said Latrell Sprewell,
carrying the New York battle cry. ``We might as well let it all
hang out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely don't want them popping champagne on our
court,'' said Kurt Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   If not here, then back there in the shadow of the Alamo, but the
Spurs will eventually fill their mouths with the sweet taste of
those championship bubbles, which is what everybody outside New
York _ and perhaps a few long-suffering Spurs fatalists _ knew was
going to happen right from the start of this mismatch final series.
</P>
<P>
   For when you get through all of the emotion and some of the
problems the scrambling Knicks can present on a given night, it
still comes down to this basic basketball tenet: Size does matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs are bigger than the Knicks. And the bigger Spurs _
Duncan and Robinson _ are so much better than the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Without their warrior in the middle, Patrick Ewing, sidelined by
a torn Achilles' tendon, the Knicks entered this battle against
Goliath as David without a slingshot.
</P>
<P>
   For a game or two, or a moment or two, anything is possible. We
see it every March in the NCAA Tournament, where Gonzaga can knock
off Stanford or Weber State gets North Carolina. The Knicks had
their night of fantasy flight as well, riding Allan Houston's 34
points and a wave of emotion at the Garden to their Game 3 win.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA requires the underdog to pull off four upsets in a
best-of-seven series, and that is just not so likely to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs regrouped after the loss Monday and were a different
team. They went back to doing all of the things that enabled them
to run up the best record in the league during the regular season
and win 45 of their past 52 games. Avery Johnson went back to
darting through the paint for driving layups or handing the ball
off for his 10 assists. Mario Elie returned strong and made big
plays one game after he had been cruelly taunted in his hometown.
Sean Elliott did an excellent job of shadowing Houston on defense
and finally broke out with key fourth-quarter baskets.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there always were Duncan and Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have two big guys, and that means you can't take it to
the basket very much,'' Sprewell admitted. ``They're a little too
tall for us sometimes, and we don't have much of an inside
presence.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a harsh reality that is difficult to avoid. Which leaves
so many hoping for a miracle, like the night in 1970 when Willis
Reed made his limping, triumphant return before a roaring Garden
crowd and lifted the Knicks to a title. They are still showing that
scene, now nearly three decades old, on the video screen before
each game, as if such magic can be replayed and recreated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything is possible, if you believe,'' said the feisty point
guard Charlie Ward. ``They don't make up those shirts for
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But they make them up in XXXL for Tim Duncan and David Robinson,
a simple fact that is easier to believe in.

 By JERRY WIZIG  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
At 5:10 p.m. Thursday, Larry Dierker strode as briskly as ever onto
the Astrodome field, and it was as if the Astros manager had never
been away.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``He looks great, relaxed as ever, and it's just great having
him back after everything that has happened,'' interim manager Matt
Galante said as the players took batting practice before their game
with Cincinnati. ``I've talked to him every day that he was able to
take calls after it (his grand mal seizure in the Dome dugout June
13) happened, and (general manager) Gerry Hunsicker told me this
morning that Larry would be coming out tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same old Larry.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, that instead of his baseball uniform, Dierker
was wearing one of his assortment of Hawaiian-style sport shirts
and a light-colored summer straw hat with a dark band.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always has a good-looking hat,'' Galante noted.
</P>
<P>
   So did Dierker in his first appearance at the ballpark since the
seizure that convulsed him so violently and, with nearly 40,000
fans and his players watching silently and prayerfully, sent him
away in an ambulance. The next day he underwent five hours of brain
surgery for a pair of masses of tangled blood vessels known as
arteriovenous malformations.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Menke, the former Astro who is now the Reds' hitting
coach, walked up to greet his old friend near the batting cage.
``I'm feeling pretty good,'' Dierker assured him. ``Same old me.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Menke said, ``He looks as natural as before it all
happened. He looks like he had never been gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven days, 2 hours and about 20 minutes after the incident in
his brain that could have ended his life, Dierker was his usual
affable, joking self.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief 10-minute, on-field media session, Dierker was
asked if he would have a similar hat for every ensuing trip to the
Dome before he resumes his managerial duties. Said Dierker, ``You
only need one or two if you really like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker related how, after the surgery, he gradually regained
memory of the preceding events. ``On the third day, I was able to
get out of bed and have a cup of coffee and read the paper, the
things that a lot of people do the first thing in the morning,'' he
said. ``I thought it was like a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching the Astros play on TV from the hospital wasn't quite
the same as being there in person, and as soon as he received
medical clearance, Dierker was back, sooner than expected. He
wasn't expected in the Dome until later in the current homestand,
possibly by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told to come here and be like a fan and not like a
manager,'' Dierker said. ``So I guess I'll leave about the third
inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Which he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see the team play, and the only way to do that was
to be here,'' Dierker reasoned. ``I'm sure I'll talk to Gerry and
Matt as the days go by. I think things have gone well. I don't see
any difference from before. I know I can't try to rush things to
get back too soon, so I'll do what they tell me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker was given a standing ovation by the crowd of 25,543 when
he was introduced in the bottom of the first inning as he watched
the game with his wife, Judy, from Hunsicker's box on the press
level.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Spiers, Craig Biggio, Jeff Bagwell and Billy Wagner were
some of the Astros who greeted Dierker's unexpected return.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see him alive and well, it really is a lift,'' Wagner said.
``Just knowing he will be fine and things are OK, we've been
blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Spiers: ``With all the things he's gone through and to see
him back in such a short time is really unbelievable. He seems like
the same old person.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not quite, suggested Biggio, good-naturedly. ``He's
got a nasty zipper on his head, I'll tell you that,'' said Biggio,
``but he said he had plenty of hats (to cover the surgical scars).
He said he hadn't missed an inning of the games he'd been able to
watch. I told him he might have wanted to miss a couple or he might
have a relapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning serious, Biggio said, ``We've pretty much dedicated the
rest of the season to him. If anyone deserves anything positive, it
should happen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell summed up the relieved mood in the Astros' clubhouse,
saying, ``It was just great to see him back. It was pretty crazy,
with what he went through, to see him walk back in in such a short
time.''

HOLLYWOOD GOLD CUP LIMPS TO FINISH LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Even before Old Trieste's foot abscess and
fever turned the ``now'' horse into the ``no'' horse this week,
something was missing from Sunday's Hollywood Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The field was already small _ without Old Trieste, it's down to
four runners, leaving bettors with the fewest choices in 60
runnings of Hollywood Park's signature event and longshot players
up a creek. And it was already a locals-only affair _ every horse
based in Southern California, costing it the East-West intrigue
that ought to accompany a race in the ``NTRA Champions on Fox''
series.
</P>
<P>
   Show me anybody who's excited about the Gold Cup, even though
it's a $1 million race involving a Kentucky Derby winner, Real
Quiet, a rags-to-riches story, Budroyale, and two bullets from the
popular Richard Mandella barn, Puerto Madero and Malek.
</P>
<P>
   Where to place the blame?
</P>
<P>
   Blame bad luck for one thing. If not for untimely injuries to
Old Trieste, Santa Anita Handicap winner Free House and Strub
winner Event of the Year, and the fade and retirement of Silver
Charm, this would be an appealing Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Blame the fact the nominating process began March 5, when owners
had to make their first, $1,000 payment, and supplemental
nominations closed 11 days before the race, when latecomers would
have had to put up $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to nominate way too early for these races,'' Real
Quiet trainer Bob Baffert said. He believes that keeps
opportunistic horsemen from jumping in after the withdrawal of a
favorite like Old Trieste weakens the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Blame what some see as the growing conservatism of trainers who
are too concerned about maintaining their win percentages to take a
calculated gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's so worried about whether they're a 10 percent
trainer, or a 20-percent trainer, or a 4 percent trainer, it takes
away their creativity,'' Mandella said.
</P>
<P>
   But save much of the blame for the National Thoroughbred Racing
Association series itself.
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural 11-race series is meant to induce top older horses
to race against each other from coast to coast, creating a
spring-to-fall story line worthy of network television. Ironically,
it has damaged the one race that already had a good East-West thing
going.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992 the Gold Cup has been won by Eastern shippers Sultry
Song, Cigar and Skip Away. It's been the most welcoming of major
California races.
</P>
<P>
   But when Hollywood Park begged the New York-based trainer of
Behrens to send the NTRA series points leader here, Jim Bond said
no. He said he didn't want to ship west twice, knowing that the
series requires horses to run in the Aug. 29 Pacific Classic at Del
Mar to turn their accumulated points into cash. Behrens will stay
in New York and run in the series' July 5 Suburban Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park racing secretary Martin Panza has been polite
about it this week: ``I can't say the series did this to me.'' He
did, though, predict disaster for the Gold Cup when the series
format was unveiled last winter.
</P>
<P>
   NTRA officials speak of the series as a work in progress. The
format could change for next year. Unfortunately that's not
entirely up to the NTRA.
</P>
<P>
   Individual tracks won't necessarily cooperate on scheduling
races (though, now that Churchill Downs owns Hollywood Park,
Churchill's Stephen Foster Handicap and Hollywood's Gold Cup
probably won't be held two weeks apart again). Fox programmers must
be consulted.
</P>
<P>
   Most years, it will be the horses who decide if the series
succeeds. Give the NTRA a healthy Cigar or Skip Away every season
and watch it Go Baby Go. But horses aren't stock cars or golfers.
Injuries have to be expected.
</P>
<P>
   What can be done while we wait for a horse of steel? Suggestions
include: trimming the series schedule, so that trainers would have
less excuse for skipping a major race like the Gold Cup; sweetening
the purses, paying all the way down to eighth place, a safeguard
against four-horse fields; and flip-flopping the crucial series
finale, holding it in the West one year and the East the next, so a
race like the Gold Cup doesn't suffer every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing succeeds overnight,'' Mandella said _ and, from
Hollywood Park's standpoint, certainly not the NTRA series.
</P>
<P>
   Also this weekend: The Gold Cup is one of eight stakes at
Hollywood Park tonight, Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge will go without blinkers in Saturday's
Affirmed Handicap for 3-year-olds, the Santa Anita Derby winner's
first start since he finished a bruising 11th in the Kentucky
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Chris McCarron, who lost a shot at his first Gold Cup victory
when Old Trieste fell ill, can get some consolation, he rides
odds-on Manistique against Gourmet Girl and four others in the
$400,000 Vanity Handicap for fillies and mares on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Breeders' Cup Sprint winner Reraise (Corey Nakatani) faces nine
horses in the 7-furlong Triple Bend Handicap on the Gold Cup
undercard.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Arcadia: These are unsettling days in the halls of
Santa Anita, where Frank Stronach marked six months behind the
track chairman's desk by shaking up the executive roster over the
past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Out: president and CEO Bill Baker and executive VP and GM Cliff
Goodrich. New president and CEO: Lonny Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Out: VP of racing Tom Robbins and racing secretary Tom Knust.
New director of racing: Mike Harlow.
</P>
<P>
   Out: marketing VP Craig Dado. New marketing director: Remi
Bellocq.
</P>
<P>
   Out: simulcasting director Bruce Matthias. New simulcasting
director: Andy Kure.
</P>
<P>
   Baker and Goodrich resigned after their influence waned.
Matthias took a leave of absence to run for the California Assembly
from Orange County. Dado was offered a position in the new Santa
Anita parent company and hasn't announced whether he'll accept it.
</P>
<P>
   Harlow, Belocque and Kure arrive on the coattails of Powell, who
spent nine years as an executive at R.D. Hubbard-run horse and
greyhound tracks, the past five as the boss of Turf Paradise in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, 39, grew up around racing as the son of jockey Taylor
Powell. The elder Powell rode Liberal Art, whose $322.10 payoff in
a 1956 race remained the highest win mutuel at Hollywood Park for
33 years.
</P>
<P>
   More lower-profile changes are expected at Santa Anita. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A WEEK AT THE RACES &QL; 
Hollywood Park leaders: Jockeys (through Wednesday): Alex Solis, 45
wins; Garrett Gomez, 31; David Flores and Emile Ramsammy, 29;
Laffit Pincay, 23. Trainers: Ron McAnally, 20; Julio Canani and Ted
West Jr., 11; John Sadler, 10; Bob Baffert, Jack Carava, David
Hofmans and Mike Mitchell, 9. &QL; 
Handicapper helper: In the '90s the Hollywood Gold Cup has been a
race for horses with early speed. There have been four
front-running winners _ 27-1 Marquetry, 8-1 Slew of Damascus, 9-1
Siphon and 2-5 Skip Away. Only Best Pal and Cigar were able to
rally from more than 2{ lengths off the pace. &QL; 
On the stakes schedule: At Hollywood Park: tonight, $150,000 Fran's
Valentine, California-bred fillies and mares 3 and up, 1 1/16 miles

miles on turf; Sunday, $1 million Hollywood Gold Cup, 3-year-olds
and up, 1\ miles, $300,000 Triple Bend Breeders' Cup Handicap,
3-year-olds and up, 7 furlongs, and $250,000 A Gleam Handicap,
fillies and mares 3 and up, 7 furlongs. At Belmont Park: Saturday,
$250,000 Mother Goose, 3-year-old fillies, 1 1/8 miles. At
Woodbine: Sunday, $500,000 Queen's Plate, 3-year-old
Canadian-breds, 1{ miles. &QL; 
Mileposts: First post at Hollywood Park is at 7 tonight. Gates open
at 11 a.m. for simulcast wagering on Belmont Park, Churchill Downs
and the Stockton fair. The last four Friday cards of the meet will
be held under the lights.... First post Sunday is earlier than
usual at 12:10 p.m. The Hollywood Gold Cup is scheduled as the
fifth race at 2:40. Gold Cup coverage on Channel 11 starts at 2
p.m.... This will be the first Gold Cup with a title sponsor _ San
Diego-based Sempra Energy.... Laffit Pincay's victory aboard Da Hot
Affair on Wednesday put him within 78 of Bill Shoemaker's record
8,833.... Pincay and Southern California rivals Chris McCarron,
Alex Solis and Chris Antley are among 12 riders in the third NTRA
All-Star Jockey Championship tonight at Lone Star Park near Dallas.
Gary Stevens won the four-race competition in 1997, Shane Sellers
in '98. Fans there _ but not here _ can bet on how the jockeys will
finish. Hollywood Park will take bets only on the last two
races.... The National Thoroughbred Racing Association and the
Daily Racing Form announced plans for the first National
Handicapping Championship to be held Jan. 7-8 at the MGM Grand in
Las Vegas. First prize: $100,000. NTRA-member tracks _ including
Hollywood Park, Del Mar and Santa Anita _ are to hold qualifying
tournaments with top-four finishers promised expenses-paid trips to
the finals.... Dramatic Gold has been retired following another
injury. The 8-year-old gelding won 9 of 39 starts, including his
'96 Meadowlands Cup victory and his '94 Breeders' Cup Classic
third, and earned more than $2.5 million for breeder-owners John
and Betty Mabee.... Tuesday's fire in trainer James Toner's Belmont
Park barn claimed a third equine victim Wednesday. Surely Handsome,
a 3-year-old maiden, was euthanized because of the effects of smoke
inhalation. The fire also killed Clear to Launch, a 3-year-old
gelding with one victory, and Graceful Finish, an unraced
2-year-old filly.... Excellent Meeting, who won Sunday's Princess
Stakes in her first start since being pulled up in the Preakness,
will aim for the July 17 Hollywood Oaks, trainer Bob Baffert
said.... Baffert's unbeaten 2-year-old filly Chilukki will run in
the 5{-furlong Debutante Stakes on Saturday at Churchill Downs.
Churchill's spring meet ends Sunday.... Sprinter Orville N Wilbur's
will miss the Triple Bend and perhaps four months after chipping a
sesamoid in a Saturday workout.... Fair-circuit racing moves to
Pleasanton on Wednesday.

JURORS MAY BE QUESTIONING STATE'S CASE IN SLEEPWALKING TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For what emergency would Scott Falater need a large hunting
knife?
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't any of Yarmila Falater's relatives testify?
</P>
<P>
   Did Scott Falater take a lie-detector test?
</P>
<P>
   These were among the questions jurors asked Judge Ronald
Reinstein on Thursday during the 12-member panel's first day of
discussing whether to convict Falater of first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Falater said he was sleepwalking when he stabbed his wife,
Yarmila, 44 times and dragged her into the backyard pool in January
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did Yarmila have any close family that she might of confided
in? If so, why didn't we hear from her side of the family?'' read
one of the questions, which were released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Reinstein answered that neither the court nor the
attorneys could answer the question.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact the jury asked it means it might be finding holes
in the state's case against Falater, said Michael Black, a longtime
criminal defense attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probing,'' Black said. ``They're probably trying to
find some kind of motive here or the absence of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something's wrong, you'd think she'd complain to an older
sister. It's indicative of a knock against the state on the motive
issue. . . . There's something they're reaching for that the state
didn't show.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Juan Martinez, the deputy Maricopa County attorney who
prosecuted the case, nor Michael Kimerer, the defense attorney,
would comment on the jury questions.
</P>
<P>
   Falater's attorneys have argued that Falater had no motive to
kill his wife of 20 years. They put on a ``nerd'' defense, saying
the mild-mannered electrical engineer was never known to raise a
hand against his high-school sweetheart, the only woman he ever
dated.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have hinted at trouble in the marriage. Martinez
said that sparks flew between the two because Yarmila was losing
interest in the couple's Mormon faith, and that she didn't want any
more children, as Scott did.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez also pointed out to the jury that Yarmila wasn't
wearing a wedding ring when she was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   But neither of the couple's children nor Yarmila's friends
testified that there were any signs of abuse or trouble in the
couple's Paradise Valley home.
</P>
<P>
   The jury got the case Wednesday at 3:30 p.m. and deliberated
until 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   It came back Thursday at 9:30 a.m., took a lunch at noon and a
quick break at 2:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's five questions came from morning sessions and were
considered by Reinstein and attorneys on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The question about Yarmila Falater's family members was the most
telling of the five submitted to Reinstein, according to Black,
after looking at them at the request of The Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these questions can be no more than jurors not able to
remember specifically what happened (in court),'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   One question asked whether the jury is to accept as fact two
other sleepwalking cases mentioned in court.
</P>
<P>
   One involved a Canadian man named Ken Parks who was acquitted of
murder after saying he was sleepwalking when he killed his
mother-in-law. The other involved a lawyer who ran his car over two
girls while supposedly sleepwalking.
</P>
<P>
   The judge told the jurors that the court did not tell them to
assume those two stories are true.
</P>
<P>
   One question asked whether the clothes Falater put in the
Tupperware container in his car's trunk were the same ones that
were always kept there.
</P>
<P>
   The judge told the jury it must rely on individual notes and
recollections.
</P>
<P>
   The jury had more questions for Falater.
</P>
<P>
   The question asked what emergency would ever require Falater to
use a large hunting knife. Falater testified he always kept the
knife in the back of his car, along with an emergency change of
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The question went on to ask Falater whether he stored any other
emergency tools in the back of his car.
</P>
<P>
   The defense theory is that Falater used the hunting knife to fix
a defective pool pump while sleepwalking when his wife touched him,
sending him into a violent rage.
</P>
<P>
   The judge told the jury Falater cannot be recalled to the
witness stand to answer the questions.
</P>
<P>
   Another question asked whether Falater was ever given a
lie-detector test. The judge responded that Falater was not and
that such evidence wouldn't be admissible in court anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Based on that question, Black, who has been a defense attorney
for 16 years, said the jury is trying to judge Falater's
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably made an assessment initially whether he's
believable or not, and by the nature of the question, they can't
tell,'' he said. ``And they are probably trying to figure out if
(the court) has gone the extra mile as to whether he's telling the
truth or not.'' &QL;

HOUSE VOTES TO PREVENT POLICE FROM KEEPING DRUG MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN DILLON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The U.S. House tried Thursday to do what
Missouri legislators and courts have not yet been able to do --
prevent state and local police from keeping drug money that is
supposed to go somewhere else. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The House passed a bill that requires state and local police to
follow their own laws rather than federal laws when they seize drug
money and property. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many law enforcement agencies have not done that in Missouri.
Under state law, drug money seized by local police is supposed to
go through a state court, which usually sends it to public
education. But The Kansas City Star reported in January that police
had found a way to divert millions of dollars and keep it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They simply turn the money over to a federal agency, which takes
a portion and gives the rest back to police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bill that passed Thursday included several provisions that
would make it harder for federal law enforcement agencies to
confiscate money and property in suspected drug crimes. The bill,
sponsored by Reps. Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican, and John
Conyers, a Michigan Democrat, passed 375 to 48. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All Missouri representatives voted for it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The amendment that addresses the Missouri situation was added
this week in response to the stories published in The Star, Hyde's
office said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, Thursday's action doesn't solve the Missouri problem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First the bill must go to the Senate, where its fate is
uncertain. And if it passes there, Missouri officials said, it
won't entirely close loopholes police are using. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, several state legislators who are working on their own
forfeiture reform bills said Thursday they welcomed help from
Congress. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just really glad to hear this because I didn't know the
federal government had listened to our pleas that we had
problems,'' said Rep. Jim Kreider, a Nixa Democrat and speaker pro
tem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kreider is leading a Missouri House interim committee that will
begin meeting in late summer to review state forfeiture laws. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   State Auditor Claire McCaskill also said she was pleased by the
Hyde-Conyers bill. McCaskill has surveyed the seizure process of
almost all law enforcement in Missouri and is conducting several
audits of police department seizure funds. She expects to report
her findings to the legislature in late summer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think probably the very best way to clear up any abuses of
circumvention of state law is to change federal law,'' McCaskill
said. ``If you don't change the federal law, enforcement of the
state law will continue to be a very time-consuming and onerous
process.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Department of Justice document shows that in Missouri police
have turned over to the federal government in three years an
estimated $19 million and received back $15 million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hill, U.S. attorney for the Western District, would not
comment on Hyde's amendment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in the past, Hill and other law enforcement officials have
defended their actions, saying they don't break state law. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon, who represents the Highway
Patrol, could not be reached for comment because he was out of
state, his spokesman said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the federal Drug Enforcement Administration did
not return phone calls this week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The agency has a policy that seizures should be pursued in state
court if they were part of a state investigation. But in March, the
agency said the responsibility to follow state laws belongs to
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each state and local agency is expected to follow all
appropriate laws and regulations,'' the agency said in a written
statement. The agency has refused to comment further. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For their part, local and state police have maintained they did
not violate a state law that specifically prohibits them from
transferring a seizure to a federal agency. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police say they never actually seize the money or property they
transfer to a federal agency; They are merely holding it until a
federal agency can ``officially'' seize it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Waldeck, an attorney for the Kansas City school board,
raised concerns that Hyde's bill would not cover the seizure
issue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a bear trap in any legislation that they put
out which clearly establishes what a state seizure is,'' Waldeck
said. ``That all has to be spelled out in spades so you can't
monkey with the circumstances.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The school district has filed a class action lawsuit against all
law enforcement in Missouri to recover all drug money police have
seized since 1986. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, state Sen. Harry Wiggins said the seizure issue would
be corrected in Missouri. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We can address that here, and I will find a way to do that,''
Wiggins said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican who helped move the
forfeiture bill to the House floor, mocked the police stance on
when a seizure becomes a seizure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `` `We didn't seize the money -- we just held the money,' ''
Blunt said. ``I wouldn't want to be on their side if they litigated
this. I think they would lose.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri provision of the Hyde-Conyers bill would require
the proceeds from a federal forfeiture to be distributed according
to state law when a state or local law enforcement agency has been
``directly involved'' in seizing the money or property. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many Missouri legislators have said they do not want police
agencies generating revenue for themselves because they fear it
leads to conflicts of interest that can lead to illegal searches
and seizures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hyde made that argument Thursday during debate on the bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have a chance at equal justice,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bill is Hyde's latest attempt to correct police abuses when
taking people's property. In fact, he has written a book on the
subject. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Missouri provision, the measure also will require
the federal government to prove property it wants to keep is
related to a crime. Currently the owner must prove the property is
``innocent.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The measure also provides attorneys for people who are poor and
eliminates a bond that must be paid by the owner in order to
contest a seizure, usually $5,000 or 10 percent of the value of the
property. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The forfeiture issue has brought together an odd consortium in
support of Hyde's bill: conservative and liberal politicians such
as Hyde and Massachusetts Democrat Barney Frank, the ACLU and the
National Rifle Association. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bill now goes to the Senate, where it has been reported that
the Justice Department and powerful law enforcement lobbying
associations are gearing up to oppose the bill. &QL; .MDSD/.MDNM/

   JERUSALEM _ Israeli fighter planes bombarded Lebanon on Thursday
night and early Friday while Shiite Muslim guerrillas fired rockets
into northern Israel, with the exchanges reportedly leaving two
Israelis and six Lebanese dead and dozens wounded. The action was a
severe step-up in the conflict in southern Lebanon at a moment of
political transition in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   It was a back and forth of retaliatory attacks, which began on
Thursday afternoon when Shiite Muslim guerrillas from the
Hezbollah, or Party of God, showered northern Israel with Katyusha
rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Israel then let loose a furious aerial assault, with nine
airstrikes on power stations, guerrilla strongholds and bridges in
Lebanon, causing a blackout in Beirut, killing six and wounding 45
people, according to The Associated Press in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   And, just after 11 p.m., Party of God guerrillas resumed fire on
northern Israel, where most residents were huddled in shelters. Two
Israeli civilians died. A third was severely wounded, with at least
12 others also reported hurt. The deaths were the first of
civilians in northern Israel related to the Lebanon conflict since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is stepping up at an intensely delicate moment,
days after Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak and Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad, who controls much of Lebanon, made public
declarations of their mutual intentions to reopen peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters, the decision to bomb was made by the
departing prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. He continues to run
the country one month after his election defeat on May 17 while
Barak assembles a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the bombing began, television reporters asserted
that while Netanyahu had authorized the attack, Barak had been
informed. But the prime minister-elect's office was quick to
respond that he was not involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a part of the decision-making process in this
matter,'' Barak's office said in a statement broadcast on Channel
One television.
</P>
<P>
   Barak promised during the campaign to end Israel's longstanding
military presence in southern Lebanon. Toward that end, he is eager
to kick-start the negotiations with Syria, and public compliments
he exchanged with Assad this week, through the press, signaled the
beginning of the thaw.
</P>
<P>
   But the sudden intensification of the conflict is a reminder of
just how volatile the border remains, and how difficult it will be
to extricate Israeli troops from what has become a chronic
low-level war zone.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli troops have occupied a 9-mile-deep border zone in
southern Lebanon since 1985 to protect its northern towns from
attack by the Iran-backed Hezbollah. But the steady loss of from 25
to 30 Israeli soldiers a year has made its engagement there very
unpopular here.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening attack on northern Israel on Thursday afternoon,
four Israeli civilians and one soldier were lightly wounded by
Katyusha rockets and mortar bombs, which struck the border town of
Qiryat Shemona and the western Galilee town of Shlomi.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah said it was avenging a recent spate of civilian deaths
in southern Lebanon. According to a Web site of a
Hezbollah-affiliated television station, the initial attack was
provoked on Thursday by what it said had been the death of Saada
Mansour, a 45-year-old woman, in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah said Mrs. Mansour was killed by shrapnel when mortar
rounds struck her house, which was apparently caught in the
crossfire between guerrilla fighters and the Israeli-backed South
Lebanese army troops.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``In reprisal for the targeting of peaceful southern villages,
the Islamic resistance today shelled the Israeli settlements in
occupied northern Palestine with appropriate weapons,'' the
guerrillas' statement on their Web site said. ``In defense of our
civilians, our artillery reinforcement unit (ARU) bombarded with
Katyushas the settlements of Qiryat Shemona and Shlomi at 16:20 and
17:40 this afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli army statement on Thursday said that Israel had
``displayed much restraint'' after recent attacks by Hezbollah, but
that ``today's grave incident'' could not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The strongly worded statement went on to threaten not only the
Hezbollah, ``but those backing them and standing behind them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Speaking on Israeli radio on Thursday evening, Shaul Mofaz, the
army chief of staff, said political leaders had denied two recent
army requests to retaliate in Lebanon. Radio reports said the chief
of staff had shuttled back and forth between the departing and new
prime ministers, neither of whom wanted to make the decision to
take action.
</P>
<P>
   In Beirut on Thursday night, high-rise apartment buildings, many
of which are stocked with generators, gleamed in the darkened city.
At first, the Lebanese capital barely stopped in its busy Thursday
night routines. Cars clogged the streets; loudspeakers called
Muslims to prayer; and the restaurants were hopping as the weekend
began.
</P>
<P>
   By late night, though, the effects of the bombing began to be
felt _ and broadcast on television. Israelis struck a power station
on the outskirts of Beirut, three bridges south of Beirut, what
they called ``terrorist targets'' south of the Litani River, in an
area of Lebanon firmly under Syrian control, and a power substation
in the Bekaa.
</P>
<P>
   In Beirut, The Associated Press reported, the state-run
television said four firefighters had been killed and 10 people had
been wounded in a raid as they tried to extinguish flames at a
power station from an earlier attack.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday, six hours after the strike on the Jamhour
substation that overlooks Beirut, Israeli aircraft struck at
another substation that also feeds the capital with electricity,
the AP reported. It was not immediately clear whether there were
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in northern Israel, reports of the two
civilians killed _ and one severely wounded _ began making their
way through the bomb shelters that have become like second home to
the residents.

TRIAL CASTS LIGHT ON MORMON LIFE
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scott Falater's murder trial has concentrated mainly on
sleepwalking because that's what Falater says he was doing the
night he stabbed and drowned his wife.
</P>
<P>
   But it has also touched on the sometimes-secret tenets of the
Mormon Church.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors trying to present a motive for the electrical
engineer to viciously stab his beloved wife have looked frequently
to what they say was her waning interest in the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps, she didn't want to attend temple. Perhaps it was her
refusal to have more children, as Scott wanted,'' Deputy Maricopa
County Attorney Juan Martinez said in his closing arguments to the
jury in Maricopa County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   The jury itself has been curious about the religion, whose
practitioners live mainly in Western states.
</P>
<P>
   In questions submitted to witnesses, jurors asked about the
Mormon Temple ceremony, the garments Mormons wear under their
clothes, and whether there is pressure to keep family problems
secret.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Cornwall, a sociologist at Brigham Young University, said
the church does exert societal pressure on its members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's comparable to any couple in any kind of conservative
congregation . . . where there's a high expectation of following
certain behavior,'' said Cornwall, a practicing Mormon who has
studied the sociological aspects of the religion for nearly two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Mormons are expected, for example, to wear sacred undergarments,
abstain from coffee and tea and donate 10 percent of their income
to the church.
</P>
<P>
   Falater testified that he was raised a Catholic but converted a
year before he married Yarmila after two missionaries knocked on
his door.
</P>
<P>
   Yarmila converted a few months later after the two toured the
church's headquarters in Salt Lake City. She heard the church's
doctrine about eternal marriage, Scott said, and began to cry tears
of joy.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Falater, testifying in his own defense, said he and his
wife differed on some church doctrine, but they were not serious
disagreements. For instance, he said he wanted more children; his
wife didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Church literature encourages children, though the church does
not have doctrine requiring large families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that I would have wanted more children . . . but I
also realized she ends up with 90 percent of the job then,''
Falater said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwall, the BYU sociologist, said that a Mormon family with
fewer than three children would probably feel some pressure, not
from the church, but from fellow Mormons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be some experience of social pressure that you've
stopped at two,'' Cornwall said. ``It would come from maybe other
members and come in the form of questions like, `So, do you plan to
have any more kids?' or, `When's the next one coming?' or things
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A mother's most important responsibility is to bring children
into the world and to care for and teach them,'' according to
Gospel Principles, a study guide prepared by the LDS church.
``Bearing children is one of the greatest of all blessings.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cornwall said the Falaters probably would have stopped
fielding those questions more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have felt more pressure around that in their early
30s,'' Cornwall said. ``Once kids are teenagers, no one is going to
give them any pressure. There is a time clock operating there.''
</P>
<P>
   A juror wanted to ask Falater: ``Do Mormons keep their private
home lives secret even from their own?'' But the question was
rejected by Judge Ronald Reinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwall said women do talk about family problems among each
other, and Yarmila Falater's best friends would have known about
any problems. ``How do you think they cope?'' Cornwall said.
``Those women are talking to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But Martha Beck, a former BYU professor who spent a decade
talking to 300 Mormon women about gender roles, said domestic
problems are kept in the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very close friends might hear, `We're having some problems,'
'' said Beck, who has renounced her Mormon religion. ``Often I
heard people talk about the face they show at church vs. their real
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Other jurors asked about Yarmila's not wanting to go to the
Mormon Temple in Mesa. ``Why would someone not want to go to
temple?'' one juror asked.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwall said the Mormon Temple is highly sacred and some church
members might not feel spiritually ready to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual for someone to say, `I don't want to go,' ''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other juror questions asked whether a wife's church activity
affects her husband's standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not affect his general standing if he wanted to be in
a high position,'' Beck said.
</P>
<P>
   But a wife drifting from the religious beliefs of the husband
will put a definite strain on any marriage, Cornwall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conflict does occur when you've got two different approaches
to faith,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mormon doctrine, a faithful couple will be united
in the afterlife for eternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing can part us forever except our own disobedience. This
knowledge helps us work harder to have a happy, successful
marriage,'' according to the Mormon study book. ``Temple marriage
is worth any sacrifice. It is a way of obtaining eternal
blessings.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck said a husband could treat his wife's drifting from the
religion seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than other religions, it's very important to a faithful
Mormon that their spouse be faithful as well,'' Beck said. &QL;

UNCERTAIN PEACE KEEPS U.S. SOLDIERS IN THRALL

   U.S. MARINE CAMP MONTIETH, Yugoslavia -- Amid the tedium that
anchors a Marine's day, sentries were frisking three civilian
visitors Thursday morning when shots rang out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a quarter mile off, maybe closer. Bursts of automatic
weapons fire. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's too damn close,'' shouted one Marine as his buddy
ducked behind a nest of sandbags. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Troops streamed down the hillside at this post near Cernice,
southeast of Pristina, to reinforce the checkpoint. Two helicopter
gunships soon buzzed over the pasture where the gunfire came from. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour passed. No gunmen were found, no casualties
suffered. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. troops walking the Kosovo beat as the world's police
officers so far have hardly fired their rifles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet the soldiers and Marines confess to a certain uneasiness
born of keeping peace between Kosovo's Serbs and ethnic Albanians
-- vengeful rivals the troops can't tell apart and who even in
civilian clothing are often armed and angry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here's got a grudge against somebody else,'' said
Maj. Erik Gunhus, a U.S. Army spokesman. ``And everybody's saying,
`This guy's a war criminal, that guy's a war criminal,' but we
don't have the manpower to police every situation.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And there is at least the threat of danger for the roughly 2,100
U.S. Army soldiers and 1,900 Marines holding down the American
sector of NATO's evolving peacekeeping mission in Kosovo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, soldiers hustled Brig. Gen. John Craddock, commander
of U.S. forces in the Yugoslav province, out of a meeting with
Kosovo Liberation Army officers after an ethnic Albanian raised a
grenade in his hand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday evening, Marines at a checkpoint in Zegra came
under fire from a small group of Serbs. The Americans avoided
injury in an incident that ended with two Serbs captured, two more
wounded and one dead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no motive,'' said Col. Kenneth Glueck, commander of
the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit. ``They could have been drunk.
... It puts our people on a high state of alert. You're out there
for a week and there's nothing and then there's shots coming at
you. You wake up a bit.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How the U.S. peacekeepers respond to their mission can differ
village by village and hour by hour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The shootout in Zegra was clear enough. Marines say some men
were milling near a store about 150 yards from the Americans'
checkpoint. One Serb started shooting randomly, Glueck said, and
turned his fire on the Americans when he noticed them. A little
more than an hour later, the search of a few buildings was complete
and the deadly confrontation was over. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday brought a less clear-cut dilemma for the Marines. By
late morning, 20 Serb families fleeing vengeful ethnic Albanians
lined up in a convoy to wait for an escort to nearby Gomja Budriga
as flames swallowed their wood and brick homes. KLA soldiers
crammed in a compact car tooled up and down the main lane, popping
off their rifles in victorious spurts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marines stood at their post about 200 yards away. They drove to
where the shooting and burning took place about 30 minutes after
the fighters left. The homes were mostly embers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to respond the best we can,'' said Capt. Robert
Riggle of Overland Park. ``If we see it, we're going to stop it. We
just can't be everywhere at once.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Albanians looted the homes of the mostly Serb
village and hauled the booty to their houses a few miles away in
Lladove. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking back the things they stole from us,'' said Haziz
Haziri, his wagon overflowing with clothes, a washing machine,
radios and a freezer. ``It's right to take what is ours.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marine Sgt. Alejandro Guzman Achacha watched the Albanians
loading up the Serbs' leftovers with a bemused grin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They're clearing the place out,'' said the Queens, N.Y.,
native. ``As time goes on, they're going to test, test and test us
some more to see what they can get away with.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Across the road, 21-year-old Marine medic John Holmstrom of
Calumet, Mich., tended to an ethnic Albanian family whose car
windshield was bashed by a group of Serbs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Just let me put this cream on your neck, ma'am,'' he told
Shefquete Rrahmani. ``No, it won't hurt.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is wonderful,'' said Rrahmani's daughter, Liridona. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Twenty miles away at the edge of tiny Klokot, a line of ethnic
Albanian men snaked around a storefront, waiting to claim goods
they said were stolen from them. A U.S. Army patrol unit stopped
the looting of a cache of household appliances there Wednesday, at
what had been a Serb police headquarters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the troops tried to identify the rightful owners of
the property. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People were taking stuff and putting it on their trucks,''
said Lt. Col. Mark Hennes, 39, of Knoxville, Tenn. ``Some of them
were taking back their own stuff, and some were stealing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So on Thursday the U.S. soldiers forced the residents to pony up
evidence that they owned what they wanted to take. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking for receipts or owners' manuals or a picture of
them with their blushing bride in front of the washing machine,''
Hennes said. ``Anything to show that they're not just looting.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the Marines' camp, Master Sgt. Mike Frankinburger, 42, of
Spring, Texas, barked orders to two of his charges. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a 10-foot-wide path swept for mines there and then
we'll put up a fence -- just enough to slow somebody down,'' he
said. ``You could throw a bag of grenades over there'' -- he
motioned to a cluster of domed pup tents -- ``and we could be dead
before we knew anything happened.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With that, Cpls. Jose Gutierrez and Gary May, both 21, pulled
out their green metal detector and began a fastidious walk around
the northern side of the camp. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Inside a tent a few paces away, Lt. David Everly listened to
radio traffic flooding in from patrols across 6,000 square
kilometers of Kosovo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Random weapons firing is routine, he said. Radar tracks an
average of three mortar shells a day. Everly said the Marines have
been unable yet to tell who is firing the rounds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys here can get kind of edgy,'' he said. ``It's only
natural.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: SLAVES, STAY OUT  
(DW)

 (SUBS to change spelling to Qinghai in 6th graf.)   By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Very quietly, without a word about it on paper, the United
Nations is creating a new human rights policy for the organization
and putting it into operation one step at a time.
</P>
<P>
   If it were a document, honestly and clearly written, it would
read so:
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.N. will honor and from time to time try to uphold the
human rights of oppressed countries and peoples _ provided that
they have reasonable power of their own or effective help of
nations with economic and military strength. If not, the U.N. will
not be of use to victim-nations, and in some cases will increase
the power of the oppressor.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past week alone, while still pondering the lessons of the
war over Kosovo, the beneficiary of all-out Western support, the
U.N. used its power against the interests of two of the most
persecuted, isolated and abandoned peoples on earth _ one Asian,
the other African.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the World Bank, a U.N. agency that distributes
low-interest loans to countries desperately in need of money for
health care, food and water supplies and other causes, approved
another loan to China, this one of $160 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stated purpose: to help Chinese in particularly poor districts,
and to move some of them to areas where they might live better. Of
the 58,000 who would be moved, at a cost of $40 million, all would
go from China to Tibet, the Qinghai area.
</P>
<P>
   This infuriated supporters of Tibet and set off a dispute in the
bank, headed by James D. Wolfensohn, a much-respected man in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Americans can take pride that the U.S. voted against the loan,
joined only by Germany in the 24-nation bank board. The loan is the
deliberate use of U.N. money that will speed the steady increase of
the Chinese population of Tibet since the Chinese Communist
invasion in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a judgment that the occupation is permanent, worthy
of international U.N. support. It is one more shackle to the work
of the Dalai Lama, since he fled Tibet in 1959, to keep Tibetan
nationhood and religion strong in his people's hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Tibet is claimed in its entirety by Beijing _ despite 3,500
years as a nation broken by a total of 400 years of domination by
China, Mongolia and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   No country except India, where he lives in refuge, has helped
the Dalai Lama. By world leaders, Tibet is mentioned only for brief
spurts of hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   But enough people of good heart raised so much protest about the
loan helping China occupy Tibet that the World Bank ordered an
``inquiry'' before the $40 million is actually spent. Wolfensohn
said that the project would be entirely ``transparent.''
</P>
<P>
   The delay does not satisfy Tibet's supporters, at all. But at
least the protests tell Tibetans they are not alone, not entirely.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, a U.N. human rights committee removed voice and
representation from Sudanese who have been defending themselves
against their own government. Khartoum is carrying out a civil and
religious war aimed largely at Sudanese Christians and followers of
native African religions.
</P>
<P>
   The committee refused to hear the appeal of the resistance
leader, John Garang. The offense was writing his request on his
letterhead instead of the stationery of Christian Solidarity
International, his sponsor for the meeting. Then the organization
was disaccredited.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss-based group had the status of ``nongovernmental
organization'' at the U.N. Hundreds of such help organizations,
each with a specialization in fields like medical relief, human
rights, the welfare of children and aid to refugees, have a forum

   Christian Solidarity International was impudent enough to prove
the existence of slavery in Sudan by buying 1,000 people, and of
course setting them free. By disaccrediting the organization the
``human rights'' committee established the penalty of ouster for
incurably forthright groups, and for itself the punishment of
infamy.
</P>
<P>
   If allowed to stand, the decisions on Tibet and the Sudanese
resistance will live on as a U.N. message to nations weak, isolated
and persecuted: Slaves, stay out.

BURKETT SHARP IN VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Right-hander John Burkett endured six
atrocious starts, a five-week assignment as the Rangers' long
reliever and a 37-minute rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, his 11 1/2-week wait for that elusive first victory ended
last night when closer John Wetteland retired Oakland's Matt Stairs
for the final out of the Rangers' 5-2 triumph at The Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Rangers departed for Seattle by winning the first of
five consecutive three-game series against American League West
opponents with their second victory in as many nights against the
Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett (1-3) allowed two runs on six hits and recorded five
strikeouts during his 82-pitch, six-inning appearance that began
rather ominously.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Tony Phillips greeted Burkett with a single and
advanced to third on a double by shortstop Miguel Tejada, and
surely the ``here we go again'' thoughts crossed the minds of many
at The Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Such thoughts would be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett retired left fielder Ben Grieve on strikes and first
baseman Jason Giambi on a foul pop before inducing an inning-ending
ground ball from designated hitter John Jaha.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett also escaped a two-hit second inning and retired 10
consecutive batters before Tejada's sixth-inning bunt single.
Tejada would score on Jaha's two-out home run, but by then the
Rangers had scored five times against right-hander Tim Hudson
(2-1).
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Juan Gonzalez delivered home the evening's first
run with his first-inning sacrifice fly, and designated hitter
Rafael Palmeiro followed with a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   The support did not stop there.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Ivan Rodriguez, who entered this game with five hits and
four runs batted in during his previous 10 at-bats, collected his
second single in as many at-bats. His two-out, second-inning single
scored center fielder Roberto Kelly and shortstop Royce Clayton and
provided Burkett a five-run lead to protect.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett earned his May 18 demotion to the bullpen with five
horrendous starts that produced an 0-3 record and 13.24 earned-run
average, but the stint there did him well.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett regained lost arm strength and rediscovered success by
accumulating a 3.00 ERA in 18 innings as the Rangers' long
reliever.

DABBLING DAVEY IS DISAPPOINTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dave Hansen started at third and Todd
Hollandsworth was in center. Short of picking names from a hat, Los
Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson continues to dabble in an
effort to find offensive consistency, using his 50th different
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no magic formula,'' recently acquired second baseman
Craig Counsell said. ``Everyone's looking for a magic formula. Guys
have to get on base and guys have to get them in. The first couple
guys have to get on for the big guys like (Gary) Sheffield and
(Raul) Mondesi and they have to drive them in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have done neither well, which is why they're 13th in
the National League with 316 runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   In losing eight of their past 11 games, the Dodgers have scored
more than three runs three times and they're averaging 3.4 runs per
game.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's game against San Diego ended a nine-game homestand in
which the Dodgers performed abysmally on offense. Heading into the
game, the only regular to hit better than .280 on the homestand was
Sheffield, who was at .412.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros was tops at .280, followed by Adrian Beltre (.250),
Devon White (.217), Jose Vizcaino (.208), Eric Young (.158), Angel
Pena (.120) and Raul Mondesi (.111). ``I wish I knew (what was
wrong),'' Johnson said. ``I don't figure we can be any worse. They
have to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's latest attempt to find the nonexistent offense was
batting Hansen, who started for Beltre, second and sitting White to
get Hollandsworth's left-handed bat in the lineup. It came a day
after Young and Mondesi were given days off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beltre's kind of overswinging a little bit, so this should
kind of freshen him up,'' Johnson said. ``Devo, the same thing. I
haven't had Hollandsworth in there, and I want to get him in there
and see if I can get him locked in like he was in the spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn back on DL: San Diego right fielder Tony Gwynn admits the
worst part of chasing his 3,000th hit is answering the same
questions over and over. For another two weeks, though, he'll do
just that.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in a month, a strained left calf sent Gwynn
to the 15-day disabled list. The Padres announced the move
(retroactive to Sunday) before Thursday's game against the Dodgers.
Gwynn, who is 18 hits shy of 3,000, is eligible to come off the
disabled list July 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about this for so long and now I'm going to have
to sit and answer two more weeks of questions,'' said Gwynn, a Long
Beach Poly graduate. ``It'd be easy to sit here and be frustrated,
but I take the other approach. It could be my Achilles' (tendon)
again and I'd be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn is batting .338 in 45 games. He was originally placed on
the disabled list May 22, returned June 12 but was reinjured during
a weekend series with Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Pena's plate problems: Since taking over the top catching
duties, Pena has kept runners from stealing bases, but he's also
fallen in line with the rest of the Dodgers and can't hit a lick.
</P>
<P>
   Seven runners attempted to steal in the last eight games. Four
of them were thrown out. However, he's 3 for 25 in that span and is
hitting .190 with four RBI this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the games I'm coming in and watching the review on the
tape,'' Pena said. ``I'm in a slump. Sometimes I see it good. Maybe
I'm trying to do too much. I'm trying to hit the ball and I'm
opening too quick.''
</P>
<P>
   FYI: Reliever Doug Bochtler accepted his minor-league assignment
and reported to Triple-A Albuquerque.... Dodgers pitchers have
allowed 95 homers. Only Chicago, Colorado and Florida have given up
more in the National League.

 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An unusual coalition of liberals and conservatives
persuaded the House of Representatives Thursday to approve
legislation to make it much harder for federal and state law
enforcement authorities to confiscate property before they bring
criminal charges in narcotics and other cases.
</P>
<P>
   By a lopsided vote of 375-48, the House for the first time
rolled back nearly 30 years of criminal measures passed at the
height of what were then called wars on drugs and terrorism. Those
measures substantially broadened the authority of federal and state
authorities to seize houses, cars, cash, boats, planes and other
assets before filing criminal charges. But in recent years the
seizure of property from people who were never convicted _ and in
some cases never even faced charges _ raised concerns among both
liberals and conservatives that the powers were being abused.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping short of threatening a veto, the Clinton administration
opposed the legislation, saying it would make it more difficult to
combat crime. A substitute measure diluting many of the central
features of the bill and supported by the White House was defeated,
268-155. No similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate,
but supporters of the House bill said that its huge victory would
put pressure on the Senate to act.
</P>
<P>
   The approved measure, which raises the legal standard for
seizure in federal cases, expands legal defenses and provides
lawyers to poor property-owners involved in such cases, attracted a
remarkable coalition of lawmakers and organizations across a broad
ideological spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who has spent six years trying to pass
the measure, said it ``puts civil liberties back in our judicial
system.'' He likened the current system of confiscation before
conviction to ``a throwback to the old Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   After those remarks, the other House Judiciary Committee members
who rose to endorse the measure included Rep. John Conyers,
D-Mich.; Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.; and Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   What made their alliance so incongruous was the fact that less
than a year ago, the four lawmakers had been engaged in a bitterly
emotional debate over the impeachment of President Clinton, first
in the House Judiciary Committee, and later on the floor of the
House. Hyde, the conservative chairman of the committee, and Frank,
one of its ranking liberal Democrats, are often foils in law
enforcement matters.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday they were not only unified in their support of
the measure, but also in accord in denouncing the
administration-backed weaker substitute.
</P>
<P>
   Frank called the alternative an effort ``to lower the standards
too low.''
</P>
<P>
   He was joined in denouncing both current law and the
administration's measure by Barr, another traditional political
opponent, who said that the existing law had ``become the monetary
tail wagging the law enforcement dog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Balancing the important needs of law enforcement means
striking the criminal where it hurts, in the pocket book, but not
with a blunderbuss,'' said Barr.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the measure said it went too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us not turn back the clock on the war on drugs,'' said
Rep. Jim Ramstad, D-Minn., a supporter of the alternative bill that
failed.
</P>
<P>
   With a growing number of cases of innocent people seeing their
assets seized, the lawmakers adopted a bill that would require the
government to prove ``by clear and convincing evidence'' that the
property was subject to forfeiture because of illegal use.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, the burden of proof lies with the person
whose property was seized, and the government has to show only
``probable cause'' that the property is subject to forfeiture, a
fairly easy standard to satisfy.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation broadens the available defense to such seizures
and eliminates the requirement that a property-owner post a 10
percent bond to challenge a seizure. It also would require the
government to provide lawyers to property owners who could not
afford them and gives property owners more time to challenge
seizures.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal supported by the Clinton administration would have
had a far lower standard for confiscating evidence, permitting
forfeitures if a ``preponderance of the evidence'' showed they were
part of a criminal act. The Clinton proposal also would have
sharply limited the provision that gives property-owners the right
to have lawyers provided by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Existing law, which gives wide discretion to federal and state
law enforcement officials to seize property, is the product of
three measures adopted since 1970 during a period when Congress
appeared less preoccupied with civil liberties issues and more
concerned about combatting terrorism and drug-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, public sentiment has begun to turn about
the issue, and was reflected by the breadth of the coalition
pushing for Thursday's measure. The group included the American Bar
Association, the National Rifle Association, the American Civil
Liberties Union, Americans for Tax Reform, the American Bankers
Association, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers,
the United States Chamber of Commerce, and pilot, boating, hotel
and housing organizations.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Faced with that coalition and powerful anecdotal evidence of
abusive government conduct, critics of the new legislation were
unable to counter the growing view that federal forfeiture laws
were being stretched beyond reasonable limits.
</P>
<P>
   Among the examples cited during the congressional debate
Thursday was the case of a landscaper, Willie Jones, who went to a
Nashville, Tenn., airport with $9,000 in cash to travel to Houston
to buy nursery stock. He was detained at the ticket desk after
paying for his plane ticket in cash, and he had the rest of his
cash confiscated after officers told him that anyone carrying that
much money had to be involved in drugs.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill also pointed to a 1997 case involving the
seizure of $506,231 in cash from the Congress Pizzeria in Chicago.
A federal court ordered that the return of the money to the owner,
Anthony Lombardo, and reminded the U.S. attorney in Chicago that
``the government may not seize money, even half a million dollars,
based on its bare assumption that most people do not have huge sums
of money lying about, and if they do, they must be involved in
narcotics trafficking or some other sinister activity.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most compelling example of abuses of the law was
the seizure by the U.S. attorney's office in Houston of the Red
Carpet Motel last year. There were no allegations that the hotel's
owners had participated in any crimes. But prosecutors claimed the
management had failed to implement ``security measures'' dictated
by law enforcement officials, including raising room rates to make
them less affordable to criminals.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, supported by local police groups who
have reaped millions of dollars in assets from the existing scheme,
has strongly opposed the measure. The local law enforcement
organizations often prefer the federal law because under many
similar state forfeiture laws, the assets seized do not go to law
enforcement, but to other state agencies. By contrast, the federal
law allows for federal authorities to share any bounty they seize
with local law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Forfeitures have proved to be a significant source or revenue
for the federal government and for local authorities who share in
the bounty. As of the end of the last year, a total of 24,903
seized assets valued at $1 billion were on deposit _ 7,799 cash
seizures valued at $349 million, 1,181 real properties valued at
$205 million, 45 businesses valued at $49 million, and 15,878 and
other assets valued at $398 million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This harvest has led critics to conclude that the administration
has opposed change largely out of financial interests, an
accusation that White House officials today denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just not right,'' said Barry Toiv, a White House
spokesman. ``This bill would undermine our ability to combat drug
trafficking, alien smuggling, terrorism, consumer fraud and many
other criminal offenses.''

BEHEMOTH SHIP `SUSAN MAERSK' DWARFS MANY THINGS IN ITS WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE BARBER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TACOMA, Wash. _ If you laid Seattle's tallest building on its
side, the 943-foot tall Columbia Tower could hide in the shadow of
the behemoth that churned into the Port of Tacoma Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   At 1,138 feet long, the baby-blue, Danish-owned ``Susan Maersk''
is the world's largest container ship. And its 75,000 horspower,
12-cylinder, chartreuse diesel engine is the most powerful of its
kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Now halfway through her maiden voyage from Copenhagen, the ship
holds the record as the largest ever to visit a U.S. port. She
stopped in Long Beach, Wash., before reaching Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   On the shiny, glass enclosed bridge resembling an air traffic
control tower, Capt. Per Hermansen says the vessel's size isn't a
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``As captain, you don't think about the length of it,'' said
Hermansen, a 30-year veteran who started as a Maersk cadet.
Gradually working his way up aboard increasingly larger vessels was
good preparation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like running a small factory,'' he said of the ship,
which sails for Japan on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Having the latest fully integrated computer equipment helps. The
ship has 8,000 computer sensors _ including 2,000 in the engine
room alone _ that patrol everything from navigation to cargo, and a
satellite positioning computer and radar system that can detect the
tiniest craft.
</P>
<P>
   The Maersk's bridge is a captain's dream. ``This ship is one of
the first with enclosed bridge wings,'' Hermansen said from the
squeaky clean, vertigo-inducing bridge five decks above, with
heated windows and windshield wiper fluid sprayers all around.
</P>
<P>
   The Susan Maersk sat regal as a queen bee at the Port of
Tacoma's Sea-Land terminal Thursday morning, dwarfing swarms of
semi-tractor trucks and railroad cars buzzing about.
</P>
<P>
   Her immense scale seemed to shrink the Novios Mariner, a bulk
carrier unloading Australian alumina nearby _ no slouch itself at
700 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   Those who watched the ship from the port's observation tower
were forced to throw around big words to describe the big,
double-hulled ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gargantuan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Humongous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gigantic.''
</P>
<P>
   And even ... ``titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to see if it was as impressive as I read it was.
It is,'' said Jim Warren of Seattle, as the cargo containers grew
like pyramids on the desk of the ship, stacked 17 across, seven
high, eight deep below.
</P>
<P>
   The ship is known as ``post-panamax,'' meaning it can't fit
through the Panama Canal, though it can slide down the Suez Canal.
Everything seems to have been made in a land of giants. A half-mile
of
</P>
<P>
   4-inch-wide links form a mile-long chain that ends at a 17-ton
anchor. The six-blade main propeller alone is as tall as a
three-story building.
</P>
<P>
   The ship can hold 6,600 containers, each 20 feet long and each
able to hold 78,000 Washington apples. That's two or three times
what most ships carry. It can accommodate 700 refrigerator units,
making it the biggest ``reefer'' carrier in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Maersk is carrying fruit, wood pulp, chemicals, machinery,
computer parts, furniture and toys and other items on a rotation
that includes stops in China, Yokohama, Kobe, Singapore, Oman,
Rotterdam and Bremerhaven.
</P>
<P>
   Though bigger than the biggest aircraft carrier, the Maersk
doesn't require a navy to run it. It sails with 13 to 24 sailors,
with 22 on this journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a floating hotel, this ship,'' said chief steward
Kai Tarp, who's in charge of feeding, storing and provisioning the
crew for three months at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Most hotel chefs would envy his stainless steel kitchen with
convection ovens and master-chef utensils, a pantry the size of a
7-Eleven and eight freezers that hold 1,600 pounds of meat alone.
</P>
<P>
   Plush accommodations are a necessity, said Tarp, 44, who has
been at sea since he was 15. ``We work 10-hour days, seven days a
week, for the three months we are at sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Each crew member has a private cabin with a private bath, all
somewhat like suites in a good hotel. There's a gym, video library
and infirmary.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Officer Marius Gardastovu runs one of the most important
and advanced sections of the ship on A deck, overseeing fuel
bunkering, ballast and the cargo operation. While the ship's
blueprints and fuel capacity is a secret, he said it only needs two
refueling stops on its 13-week voyage.
</P>
<P>
   From his perch, Gardastovu can adjust ballast, coordinating fuel
bunkers, for example, as the ship is loaded.
</P>
<P>
   The Susan Maersk, based in Hellerup, Denmark, was built at A.P.
Moller Group's Odense Shipyard in Denmark in 1997, and named for
Moller's aunt.
</P>
<P>
   Government and shipping officials say the Susan Maersk is at the
vanguard of future shipping, and port and shipping lines are
working together to ready themselves, said Port of Tacoma spokesman
Rod Koon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sign of the challenges that face both the ports of
Seattle and Tacoma,'' Koon said. The two ports realize the region
has to improve rail and truck infrastructures that work
symbiotically with ships, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tacoma port, the Sea Land terminal is readying cranes for
larger ships.
</P>
<P>
   When it arrived Thursday, the vessel's draft _ the depth of
water a ship needs in order to float, especially when loaded _ was
30 feet. When it leaves Tacoma around noon Friday, it will be at 40
feet in the 48 foot channel. The ship is expected to pass Seattle
two or three hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Expect to see more of her ilk hereabouts in the 21st century,
said Maersk spokesman Tom Boyd, whose company has called at the
Port of Tacoma since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economies of scale is the key in liner shipping,'' he said.
``We've got to put through more volumes to make it more
profitable.''

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Maybe it was fatigue, or _ as hard as it may be to believe _ maybe
it was actually Ron Villone.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps it was a combination of the two. Regardless, there
wasn't nearly enough of what the Astros needed most in a 3-0 loss
to the Cincinnati Reds on Thursday at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're Mike Tyson or Smokin' Joe Frazier in their prime,
one hit isn't going to win many fights. Consequently, the Astros
were floored in Round 1 of this midseason showdown between the top
two teams in the National League Central Division.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros saw their division lead trimmed to three games as
they were shut out for the first time since St. Louis' Matt Morris
blanked them Sept. 22, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Villone, who took a no-hitter to the seventh inning, and
reliever Danny Graves combined to hold the Astros to one hit _
their lowest hit total since Kerry Wood of the Chicago Cubs one-hit
them in his 20-strikeout gem May 6, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give Villone credit,'' Astros third baseman Tim
Bogar said. ``He pitched well, but we swung the bats like .''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Astros, that has the scent of a trend. The
team that was leading the NL in hitting a month ago has steadily
dropped to 10th in the league. The Astros are hitting .222 in their
last 10 games (4-6).
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't swing the bats very well, and we haven't for the
past couple of weeks,'' Astros interim manager Matt Galante said.
``It's been frustrating to watch a good-hitting team go through
this, but it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds might increase when you're working on dead legs. Both
teams arrived in Houston in the wee hours of the morning and no
doubt felt the effects. ``My legs felt like they weighed about 100
pounds,'' Astros right fielder Derek Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Villone's performance trumped a strong outing by the Astros'
Mike Hampton, who allowed three runs (two earned) on four hits in
seven-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy with my stuff but not with the outcome,'' Hampton
said. ``This is a big series. The Reds have a good team, and we're
going to have to battle better than this to beat them or else we're
going to find ourselves tied (for first place in the NL Central)
before we get out of this series. This is certainly not a time to
start pressing, but we do need to start winning some games.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't been a problem for the Reds, who have won four in a
row and six of their last eight. They improved their NL-best road
record to 23-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has got to give them a boost,'' Bogar said of the Reds'
victory. ``But they have to remember it's June. They're playing hot
baseball right now and building confidence, but it's a long
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the limited scoring, Thursday's game didn't exactly take
on the identity of a pitchers' duel. The two pitching staffs
combined for nine walks and two hit batsmen. The Astros committed a
pair of errors, one of which figured in the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Astros manager Larry Dierker, who watched the first three
innings from general manager Gerry Hunsicker's box, was wise not to
endure this one in its entirety. It wasn't exactly a masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were two teams that got in late and didn't really come up
with anything,'' Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell said. ``We
combined for six hits; not to take anything away from the pitchers,
but that's ridiculous. You just don't expect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday, the Astros and Indians were the only teams in
the majors that had not been shut out. Cleveland was blanked by
Toronto on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds took a 1-0 lead in the fifth when Mike Cameron tripled
off the short fence in front of the Coca-Cola Corner in right field
and scored on Aaron Boone's double to left.
</P>
<P>
   Bell crashed into the wall and nearly made the catch on
Cameron's drive. ``I was on it,'' he said. ``It hit my glove and
knocked it (the glove) over the gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Eusebio's seventh-inning single off Villone was the Astros'
only hit. Nothing in Villone's past indicated he had what he took
to do what he did against the NL's best-hitting team against
lefthanded pitching. This was only the fourth start of his career
after 162 consecutive relief appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday, Villone had never pitched more than five
innings in a game, and he was 0-2 with a 10.80 ERA in his previous
three starts.
</P>
<P>
   When the first two Reds reached to start the eighth, Galante
lifted Hampton in favor of Scott Elarton.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lewis and Pokey Reese scored, although Elarton appeared to
have a chance to start his outing with a double play. Bagwell
charged Jeffrey Hammonds' popped-up bunt but let it drop so he
could attempt a double play. But shortstop Ricky Gutierrez couldn't
handle Bagwell's throw, and the Reds had the bases loaded with no
out.
</P>
<P>
   Reese scored on Hal Morris' fielder's-choice grounder. Barry
Larkin's broken-bat single pushed the Reds' lead to three runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baggy made the right play,'' Galante said. ``We had a double
play; we just didn't execute it very well. We turned what we
thought was a double play into disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell blamed himself for not making a better throw to second
base.
</P>
<P>
   In the grand scheme of things, all that mattered was that the
Astros couldn't handle Villone or Graves, who earned his 10th save.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LARRY Dierker lumbered onto the Astrodome floor through the tunnel
that sits exactly opposite the one through which he was whisked
away only 11 days before.
</P>
<P>
   It was nothing if not an appropriate picture.
</P>
<P>
   Most everything about this night was on the other end of the
spectrum _ the total opposite of that heart-sinking feeling that
left Dierker's team and Dierker's town wondering if he was going to
be all right.
</P>
<P>
   This was Dierker stepping through the home-plate tunnel and onto
the turf as if it was all no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   He laughed for a while with the guys holding the microphones and
notepads. He winked at a few of the early-arriving fans who were
hanging over the dugouts. He stepped behind the batting cage and
talked with the fellas before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he took an elevator up to Gerry Hunsicker's suite to
watch. Just watch.
</P>
<P>
   But on June 13, that was Dierker lying in an ambulance that sped
through the center-field tunnel. His wife sat in the front seat,
and thousands of stunned fans quietly filed out of the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   This was a surprise. That was a shock.
</P>
<P>
   This was Dierker wearing a garish Hawaiian shirt and his
favorite Panama Jack hat, looking like a cross between Don Ho and
Tito Puente, and filling the place with exactly that kind of hop
and good vibe.
</P>
<P>
   But that was Dierker lying on the floor of the Astros' dugout
with his shirt torn open, trainers and doctors scurrying about and
his players standing around him with looks of disbelief on their
faces.
</P>
<P>
   This was grand, as Dierker's return to the Astrodome for
Thursday's series opener against the Cincinnati Reds came much
earlier than anyone expected.
</P>
<P>
   But that was something called a grand mal seizure, a medical
term with which all of Houston has become much more familiar. That
was a potentially fatal condition that led to Dierker undergoing
five hours of brain surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Dierker returned to the Astrodome, all right _ emphasis on
all right.
</P>
<P>
   He showed everyone that he's going to be fine. He showed it with
those vibrant, Hawaiian colors and that casual, quippy demeanor
that might have been the best evidence yet that this is indeed the
same old Dierk.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Dierker met with his team in the clubhouse. He
didn't toss around any inspiring words. He didn't ask any ``win one
for me'' questions. He asked something totally different, something
totally Dierker.
</P>
<P>
   Wanna see my scar?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Dierk,'' Astros outfielder Derek Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the first pitch, when asked how he would handle a tight,
emotional game, Dierker ho-hummed over it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told to come here and be like a fan and not like a
manager,'' Dierker said. ``So I guess I'll leave about the third
inning.''
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, after the third was indeed when Dierker left, but
only because doctors, management and most significantly Judy
Dierker did not want to press their luck.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker's leaving proved to be quite the smart move, too.
</P>
<P>
   As healthy as Dierker's brain clearly is, the Astros' 3-0 loss
to the second-place Reds surely would have made his heart go
pitter-patter.
</P>
<P>
   Reds starter Ron Villone took a no-hitter into the seventh
inning. The Astros wasted the few opportunities they did have. And
a blundering, bumbling eighth inning sealed the Astros' fate on
this night.
</P>
<P>
   But on the other side of the outcome was the game's most popular
fan.
</P>
<P>
   When Dierker was shown on the Dome's giant video screen watching
from Hunsicker's suite, the crowd rose, cheered and called out his
name. Dierker also stood and waved, then punched the air a couple
of times as if to say, ``Go get 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Astros didn't go get anything but a loss. They had no
chance in this one, and Hunsicker's pre-game joke about Dierker
joining him in the suite proved prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can sit up there with me and help me second-guess Matt
(Galante) and complain about all the inadequacies of the players,''
Hunsicker said. ``He'll understand what it's like from where I
sit.''
</P>
<P>
   This one wasn't pretty from any angle. But as ugly as it was,
Dierker took all those sinking feelings from 11 days earlier and
turned them completely around.
</P>
<P>
   As important as it is that the Astros turn around their recent
trend of losing to good teams, Dierker probably would have joked
about his presence ``inspiring'' his team to its first shutout loss
since late last season.
</P>
<P>
   He was his old self, even if his team was not.

KLA LEADERS KILLED RIVALS WITHIN OWN RANKS, OFFICIALS SAY  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change `Wednesday' to `Thursday' in 8th graf.)  (rm) 
 By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The senior commanders of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who have a
signed agreement with NATO to disarm, carried out assassinations,
arrests and purges within their ranks to thwart potential rivals,
say current and former commanders in the rebel army and some
Western diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, in which as many as half a dozen top rebel
commanders were shot dead, was directed by Hashim Thaci and two of
his lieutenants, Azem Syla and Xhavit Haliti, these officials said.
Thaci denied through a spokesman that he had been responsible for
any killings.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States has long been wary of the KLA, the
rebel group has become the main ethnic Albanian power in Kosovo.
Rebel commanders supplied NATO with target information during the
bombing campaign. Now, after the war, the United States and other
NATO powers have effectively made Thaci and the KLA partners in
rebuilding Kosovo. The agreement NATO signed with Thaci, for
example, envisions turning the KLA into a civilian police force and
leaves open the possibility that the KLA could become a provisional
army modeled on the U.S. National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the KLA officials interviewed saw Thaci or his
aides execute anyone, they recounted, and in some cases said they
had witnessed, incidents in which Thaci's rivals had been killed
shortly after he or one of his aides had threatened them with
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the war started, everyone wanted to be the chief,'' said
Rifat Haxhijaj, 30, a former lieutenant in the Yugoslav army who
left the rebel movement last September and now lives in
Switzerland. ``For the leadership, this was never just a war
against Serbs _ it was also a struggle for power.''
</P>
<P>
   Thaci's representative in Switzerland, Jashae Salihu, denied
accounts of assassinations. ``These kind of reports are untrue,''
he said. ``Neither Thaci nor anyone else from the KLA is involved
in this kind of activity. Our goal has been to establish a free
Kosovo and nothing more.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusations of assassinations and purges were made in
interviews with about a dozen former and current Kosovo Liberation
Army officials, two of whom said they had witnessed executions of
Thaci's rivals; a former senior diplomat for the Albanian
government; a former police official in the Albanian government who
worked with the rebel group, and several Western diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Department on Thursday challenged some aspects of
these accounts. ``We simply don't have information to substantiate
allegations that there was a KLA-leadership-directed program of
assassinations or executions,'' James Rubin, the State Department
spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said he could not exclude the possibility that the rebel
leaders were somehow tied to the killings. But he said department
officials had checked a wide range of sources in the past 24 hours
and could not confirm the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   A senior State Department official and a Western diplomat in the
Balkans, citing intelligence reports and extensive contacts with
KLA officials inside and outside Kosovo, said they were aware of
executions of middle-grade officers suspected of collaborating with
the Serbs, but said they had no evidence to link those killings
with Thaci.
</P>
<P>
   The Western diplomat in the Balkans said, however, that Thaci is
legendary in the region for ruthless tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thaci has engaged in some pretty rough intimidation'' of
officials in a rival party, the diplomat said, ``but none of them
have been killed.'' He added: ``There have been detentions, and the
victims allege beatings. We cannot prove that. Thaci, according to
them, was in charge of the team that detained them and was in
charge of the interrogation and personally threatened them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thaci has a reputation for being pretty tough,'' the diplomat
continued. ``Haliti and Syla are not known for their sweet tempers.
This is a rough neighborhood, and intimidation and assassinations
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Former and current KLA officials also charge that a campaign of
assassinations was carried out in close cooperation with the
Albanian government, which often placed agents from the Albanian
secret police at the disposal of the rebel commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the State Department did not have any information to
suggest that the KLA leadership directed an execution program in
conjunction with the Albanian security services.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Western diplomat in the Balkans said he knew of at least two
Albanian secret police officers who were fighting with the KLA.
``The two officers are brigade or battalion commanders, and they've
been in the field fighting,'' the diplomat said. ``They're
volunteers from Albania.''
</P>
<P>
   Albania has long waged a campaign to unite with Kosovo, a
Serbian province where Albanians are in the majority. Such
unification was briefly achieved during Fascist occupation in World
War II and was held out as a goal by radical groups financed and
backed by Tirana in the later part of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the close relationship between Thaci and the Tirana
government, which has a reputation for corruption and has been
linked by Western diplomats to drug trafficking, is one of the
factors that disillusioned many former fighters who were
interviewed in Germany, Switzerland and Albania. The fighters said
they had fought to create a more Western, democratic state, free
from Albanian influence and control.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian minister of information, Musa Ulqini, said that
there was ``never any violation of our constitutional law.'' He
added: ``The Albanian government has relations with all of the
political and military forces in Kosovo, but it insists that these
forces unite and speak with one voice.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Two former rebel leaders and a former Albanian police official,
interviewed in Tirana, said that Haliti, who is officially Thaci's
ambassador to Albania, was working in Kosovo with 10 secret police
agents from Albania to form an internal security network that would
be used to silence dissenters in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci, 30, has named a government, with himself as prime
minister, and denounced Ibrahim Rugova, who for nearly a decade was
the self-styled president of Kosovo and ran a successful campaign
of nonviolent protest after the Serbs stripped Kosovo of its
autonomy in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci has long ties to radical groups that called for the
violent overthrow of the government in Belgrade. He joined a
clandestine organization known as the Kosovo Popular Movement that
existed on the fringes of Pristina University.
</P>
<P>
   The group was financed and backed by the Stalinist dictator of
Albania, Enver Hoxha, until his death in 1985. Its members,
including Syla, whom Thaci appointed his defense minister, and
Haliti have become the core of the leadership that dominates the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Violence has long swirled around Thaci, whose nom de guerre was
Snake.

   In June 1997, in an incident that many in the underground
guerrilla movement found ominous, a Kosovar Albanian reporter who
had close links with the movement was found dead in his apartment
in Tirana, his face disfigured by repeated stabbings with a
screwdriver and the butt end of a broken bottle.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter, Ali Uka, was supportive of the rebel movement, but
he was also independent enough to criticize it. At the time of his
death, he was sharing his apartment with Thaci.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Thaci inspired fear and respect in his home base of the central
Drenica region in Kosovo as he organized armed units and carried
out ambushes against Serbian policemen. In the early days of the
rebel uprising, in March 1998, Thaci moved about from his hometown
of Broja in a small compact car with a few bodyguards and wore an
unadorned camouflage uniform.
</P>
<P>
   There were persistent reports at the time that he personally
carried out executions of Kosovar Albanians whom he had branded as
traitors or collaborators, but no witnesses have surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci was involved, along with Haliti, in arms smuggling from
Switzerland in the years before the 1998 uprising, say current and
former senior rebel commanders.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Thaci and Haliti both have wives and children in Switzerland,
although Haliti has formed a new family in Tirana, where he has a
large villa and close links with senior government leaders, say
former and current rebel officials in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When the uprising began, and money and volunteers flooded into
Albania from the 700,000 Kosovar Albanians living in Europe, Thaci
and Haliti found themselves in charge of thousands of fighters and
tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The arms smuggling mushroomed into a huge operation that saw
trucks loaded with weapons, most bought from Albanian officials,
headed for KLA camps on the border. By the war's end, former and
current KLA officials estimate, the KLA. paid $50 million to
Albanian officials for weapons and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, a KLA commander who transported many of the
weapons, Ilir Konushevci, was ambushed and killed on the road
outside Tropoja in northern Albania. A few days earlier, in a
heated meeting with senior commanders, he had accused Haliti of
misusing funds, according to commanders who were present.
</P>
<P>
   The commander had charged that Haliti was buying boxes of
grenades at $2 apiece and charging the movement $7 for each
grenade. The killing, although it took place in a rebel-controlled
region in northern Albania, was blamed on the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Other killings of rebel commanders and political rivals ascribed
to Thaci are attributed to a struggle to consolidate control and
eliminate potential challengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cadavers have never been an obstacle to Thaci's career,'' said
Bujar Bukoshi, the prime minister in exile in Rugova's
administration, which is often at odds with the KLA. One Western
diplomat, citing intelligence reports, said that Thaci planned an
unsuccessful assassination attempt on Bukoshi last May. ``Thaci has
a single goal and that is to promote himself, to be No. 1,''
Bukoshi said.
</P>
<P>
   As the rebels suffered reverses on the battlefield in the summer
and fall of 1998, in large part due to inexperience and a lack of
central command, they turned to Kosovar Albanians who had served in
the former Yugoslav army.
</P>
<P>
   The most experienced was a former colonel named Ahmet Krasniqi
who had organized some 600 former officers, most living in
Switzerland and Germany, to join the fight. Krasniqi had
surrendered his garrison in Gospic, Croatia, in 1991 rather than
defend Slobodan Milosevic's regime in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Krasniqi had the blessing of Bukoshi, who allowed him to pass on
$4.5 million to the KLA raised by Rugova's administration. He
swiftly set up training camps in the border region and formed
special units. Bukoshi named him commander of a rival military
structure known as the Armed Forces of the Kosovo Republic. The
effort to join the armed struggle was a belated attempt by the
Rugova administration, which had swiftly lost political support in
Kosovo, to regain credibility by playing a role in the
``liberation'' of the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci and Haliti accepted the money and the trained volunteers,
integrating them into KLA units, but began to thwart Krasniqi's
attempt to build an independent military force. In June 1998 the
KLA, which controlled the border, began to divert or block arms
being taken over the mountain to these rival units fighting around
Pec and Decane. As tensions rose, Thaci and the Albanian
authorities decided to eliminate Krasniqi, according to former
rebel commanders and two former Albanian officials interviewed in
Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   They said that in the middle of September 1998, Albanian police
stopped Krasniqi and several aides and confiscated their weapons.
Krasniqi's office in Tirana was raided by about 50 policemen and
emptied of guns and munitions. On Sept. 21 at 11 p.m. on the way
back from a restaurant in Tirana, Krasniqi ran into a police
checkpoint about 300 yards from his office, according to a former
KLA commander who was with Krasniqi. Krasniqi and his two
companions were again frisked for weapons, and their vehicle was
searched. The two cars behind Krasniqi, which carried aides, were
not allowed through the checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   When Krasniqi and his two companions got out of their gray Opal
jeep they saw three men emerge from the shadows with black hoods
over their faces. The men, speaking in an Albanian accent that
distinguished them from Kosovar Albanians, ordered the two men with
Krasniqi down on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which one is it?'' asked one of the gunmen, according to one
of the commanders who was prone on the asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one in the middle,'' said another. The gunmen, who held a
pistol a few inches from Krasniqi's head, fired a shot. He then
fired two more shots into Krasniqi's head once he fell onto the
pavement.
</P>
<P>
   American officials also had reports that the KLA killed
Krasniqi, but said there were also subsequent, conflicting reports
from the region that he was killed by disaffected members of his
own unit.
</P>
<P>
   After Krasniqi's death, former KLA commanders said, the
killings, purges and arrests accelerated. KLA police, dressed in
distinctive black fatigues, threw into detention anyone who
appeared hostile to Thaci. Many of these people were beaten.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   One commander, Blerim Kuci, was taken away in October 1998 to a
KLA jail and hauled before a revolutionary court. He was held for
weeks on charges that he was a Serb collaborator and then suddenly
released in the face of a large Serb offensive and allowed to
rejoin the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw an accused collaborator tried before a revolutionary
court and then tied to the back of a car in Glodjane and dragged
through the streets until he died,'' said a former KLA officer in
Albania, who asked not to be identified. A senior State Department
official and a Western diplomat in the Balkans confirmed this
account.

</P>
<P>
   As NATO bombs fell on Kosovo this April, two more outspoken
commanders, Agim Ramadani, a captain in the former Yugoslav army,
and Sali Ceku, were killed, each in an alleged Serb ambush.
</P>
<P>
   Although a former senior rebel officer in Tirana said that Thaci
was responsible, a Western diplomat contends that that Ceku was
killed by a Serb sniper. He said that his contacts indicated that
Ramadani was killed in battle, but those contacts did not mention
an ambush, or politically related killing, in either case.
</P>
<P>
   The former KLA officer said, however, that rebel officials had
told Ceku that he and his lieutenant Tahir Zemaj should leave the
movement, but the stubborn Ceku had refused to depart. Zemaj,
however, fled to Germany. ``Tahir knew they were serious, and he
got out,'' said the officer said. ``Sali stayed, and he was
killed.''

STADIUM DISTRICT TO MARINERS: NO TO REQUEST ON COST OVERRUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN SNEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Seattle Mariners' request for help in paying $100
million in Safeco Field cost overruns was met Thursday with a stern
reply: No way.
</P>
<P>
   The state panel overseeing construction of the $517 million
ballpark told the Mariners baseball team it is not willing to have
a mediator help determine who should pay cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not moving on this issue. As far as I'm concerned,
there's no way we're going to ask for more money'' from King
County, said Ron Judd, a member of the Public Facilities District
board.
</P>
<P>
   The ballclub's owners asked this week that $60 million from
excess ballpark tax surpluses be used to help offset the estimated
$100 million in cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears neither side is willing to budge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way to compromise,'' said Gerry Johnson, the PFD's
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Added PFD board member Bob Wallace: ``Normally in mediation you
have money involved, and the mediator beats up both sides and goes
back and forth until there is an agreement. But this is not a
split-the-baby kind of issue. It's a `what-does-the-law-say' issue.
</P>
<P>
   The PFD board's decision was unanimous after an hour-long,
closed-door session called to discuss a ``threat of litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a correct, proper and courageous decision,'' said
Chris Van Dyk, co-founder of Citizens for More Important Things, an
anti-stadium tax group.
</P>
<P>
   County Executive Ron Sims agreed, saying ``there is no need to
mediate something (the M's) contract does not entitle them to
have.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, in a written statement, were disappointmented and
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mediation is used routinely in this country to resolve complex
legal and business disputes. We had sought mediation so the
Mariners and the PFD could, with the assistance of a neutral third
party, attempt to resolve our conflicting views of the legislation,
our contract and other issues,'' the club said.
</P>
<P>
   The team's options include asking a court to compel the PFD to
join in mediation, although the contractual agreement between the
team and the district does not require binding mediation or
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   The team also could sue over the money it-
</P>
<P>
   self.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have not said what their plans are, and Thursday
would say nothing more than the written statement.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, Nintendo of America Inc. Chairman Howard Lincoln
hinted that the team wouldn't back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize there's a lot of people who don't agree with us,''
Lincoln said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even baseball owners are entitled to their day in court.''
Nintendon of America is the team's majority owner.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the $417 million construction budget set in July
1997, the Mariners agreed to pay $45 million while the public share
would be $372 million.
</P>
<P>
   The public funds would come from taxes on restaurant meals,
rental cars and ballpark admissions; a sales tax credit; and some
state lottery sales.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariners say a study by an investment banker the team
declines to identify showed higher-than-projected tax revenues
could allow the state to issue bonds to generate another $60
million to help cover the $100 million in cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   The team would agree to pay the other $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Ellis and Lincoln interpreted language in the 1995
state stadium financing law and the 1997 development agreement
between the team and the PFD to say the dis-
</P>
<P>
   trict is obliged to ask the county to float bonds when there is
a surplus of ballpark-related tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, PFD executive Director Ken Johnsen cited the same
documents in an analysis that argues the team is required to pay
all costs in addition to $417 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public's contribution to the project was capped at $372
million at the time that the PFD and the Mariners agreed on a
construction budget and King County issued the requisite amount of
bonds to support construction,'' Johnsen wrote in a memo to the PFD
board.
</P>
<P>
   He said state legislation requires extra tax revenues go for
early debt retirement and prohibits using public money for ``cost
overruns on initial construction.''
</P>
<P>
   He also cited King County ordinances authorizing the bonds that
forbids the refinancing requested by the Mariners and said it would
be an unconstitutional gift of public funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to imagine how agreements that describe the
Mariners' responsibility for all `cost overruns' or `supplemental
funds' could be more clear,'' Johnsen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Sims said the Mariners want windfall revenue that should be used
to retire the bonds early.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the question is, where will the benefits of our booming
economy go _ to the taxpayers or the Mariners?'' Sims asked.
</P>
<P>
   Sims' office received about 150 telephone calls and e-mail
messages about the dispute Wednesday and Thursday _ all of them
anti-Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyk said the Mariners' position relies on legal language
taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
   He said the team cited a reference that first appeared in a
state Supreme Court brief filed by the PFD and King County in 1997
in response to an appeal by the group, Citizens for More Important
Things.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the team is trying to use information furnished by
the stadium district in an unrelated case against the PFD in the
current dispute, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely the sleaziest trick in the business,'' Van
Dyke said. ``Any company that acted so cavalierly about their
public image and so discounted the value of good will and was in a
retail entertainment business, I would sell short their stock
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hattori, the county's financial adviser on the ballpark
bonds, recalled that Mariners' attorneys and finan-
</P>
<P>
   cial consultants attended all County Council meetings on the
stadium bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time during any of those discussions did they ever raise
the idea that the county would be required to issue additional
bonds,'' Hattori said.
</P>
<P>
   The PFD session drew two speakers. Kit Hawkins, a lobbyist for
the 4,000-member Washington Restaurant Association, said the
ballpark benefits relatively few restaurants and some owners
already regret supporting the stadium financing deal.
</P>
<P>
   And Vincent Koskela, a representative from Taxpayers on Strike,
said he was disgusted with the Mariners.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ No Pedro sighting in three nights. No Nomar for the
rubber game. No Tom Gordon for the forseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   No problem, it seems, for these Red Sox, a Whitman's sampler of
talent that may not offer the most appealing selection at first
glance, but somehow winds up being more satisfying than the pricier
selections in the display case.
</P>
<P>
   That includes the Baltimore Orioles, who were the hottest team
in baseball until the Sox arrived here to take two out of three,
including Thursday &UR;  &LR; night's 2-1 win over Orioles ace Mike Mussina
that was missing an injured Garciaparra but little else.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played good, they pitched good,'' said outfielder Darren
Lewis of the Orioles, who were winners of 11 of 12 after coming
from behind to beat the Sox in the opener of this three-game set,
but then scored one run in the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it seems that right now we're finding a way to get it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Those ways Thursday night were as varied as a second-inning home
run by Troy O'Leary, his third home run in three starts and 16th of
the season; seven innings of one-run pitching by Mark Portugal, the
reluctant retiree who gave up a home run to Albert Belle and no
more; a two-out single in the fifth by Garciaparra's stand-in, Lou
Merloni, who scored the winning run, and a huge hit and
highlight-reel catch by Lewis, who tripled home Merloni, then
preserved the win with a full-sprint grab of Will Clark's line
drive that was still attempting to crawl out of the webbing of
Lewis's glove when he banged into the right-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, that was some play, a game-breaker,'' said
manager Jimy Williams, who at times seems to throw his lineup into
a Vegematic but comes up with the ideal blend more often than not.
``That kind of play, that was at least a double, maybe a triple.
</P>
<P>
   ``He `coned' it, then hit the wall, but maintained possession.
That was some kind of catch. That kind of play, in a 2-1 game in
the ninth, is magnified, but rightfully so.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Wakefield, whose signature pitch has been the brass knuckler
in his new role as closer, already had one out in the ninth when
Clark, who briefly entertained the idea of signing with the Sox
this winter, launched a drive that was curling toward the foul line
almost as soon as it left his bat.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, who was already in the clubhouse after giving way to
Rheal Cormier to start the eighth, was watching on television as
Lewis gave chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way that ball was hit and breaking away from him, I didn't
think he had a chance,'' Portugal said. ``But he got a phenomenal
jump and whenever he gets a ball in his sights, I think he's going
to catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis didn't have the luxury of entertaining any doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing right field, you don't have the luxury of seeing the
ball go into the hitting zone,'' said Lewis, a center fielder by
trade, a right fielder by commitment. ``It was hit so hard, I was
running full speed, but I tried to run at an angle along the fence
instead of straight at the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I've always done. I don't know if you can teach
that. It's instinct. I didn't know how I was going to get there,
but I tried to put it in another gear, kept gaining speed on it,
and was able to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The last step before ball struck leather had a little
Baryshnikov hop to it, except ballet dancers never have to run into
a wall upon touching down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball kind of hit the heel of my glove,'' Lewis said.
``Fortunately, I held onto it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox were looking for anything to grab onto early against
Mussina, who was bidding to join Pedro Martinez as the only
pitchers in the American League with double-digit wins. Mussina,
who had allowed two runs or fewer in his last three starts, all
wins, struck out the side in the first on 11 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with 10 K's, catching leadoff man Jose Offerman
looking three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mussina's always on his game,'' Portugal said. ``He's got
nasty stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But O'Leary launched the first pitch he saw into the left-field
seats for his seventh home run this month, and the Sox pushed
across the winner when Merloni lined a single to left and Lewis
went the other way for his triple, his second in two nights, one as
leadoff man, one as No. 9 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just got to continue to go out there and do my work,'' Lewis
said. ``Keep fighting and scrapping. You're not always going to
have success on a day-to-day basis, but you can't give in.''
</P>
<P>
   Three times Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, Portugal had two men on base but
never gave in. Except for Belle's 15th home run in the second, he
neutralized a team that began the night hitting .315 for the month
and 11 days earlier had scored 22 runs in one night against
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   After winning for the first time in seven starts, Portugal said
it was enough to make a man happy he didn't hang it up before his
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this team's going places,'' Portugal said. ``We came
in here against the hottest team in baseball and won the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense is as good as anybody's. We didn't have Nomar, and
we didn't miss a beat. Anybody Jimy puts in the lineup, it's like
they want that to be their day to shine.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Sons of Jimy Williams, winners of eight of their last
11, that shine shows no signs of wearing off.

EDITORIAL: THE BELGRADE BOMBING MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven weeks after NATO bombs hit the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Congress and the American people have yet to
receive a full explanation of the mistaken attack. The absence of
information only compounds the original error and fuels speculation
that the bombing was deliberate. The White House should insist that
the various agencies involved, including the Pentagon, which has
just announced its own review, pull together everything they know
and make a public presentation as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Lethal mistakes are sometimes made in combat, and this appears
to be such a case. But a detailed reconstruction of the targeting
work is the only way the administration can eliminate doubts in
Washington and Beijing. Confidential administration briefings given
to China and to Congress have been frustratingly incomplete.
Important questions remain unanswered about how the embassy
building was misidentified and why multiple target reviews did not
pick up the error. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., and Rep. Porter
Goss, R-Fla., chairmen of the Senate and House Intelligence
committees, are right to demand a fuller accounting.
</P>
<P>
   Secrecy does not seem to be an overriding issue. The bombing
apparently grew out of mundane mistakes, like outdated maps,
transposed street addresses and breakdowns in the bureaucratic
communications. The multiple errors were made by more than one
government department.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the bombing, NATO political leaders were looking
for additional military targets, and the CIA had been called in to
suggest appropriate locations. The CIA's recommendations were then
reviewed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon and by
American military commanders in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the CIA's inspector general has found that an agency
analyst familiar with downtown Belgrade ``persistently'' questioned
whether the correct location of the intended target _ a Yugoslav
arms agency _ had been selected. Yet his repeated warnings were
somehow overlooked. The Pentagon only added to the confusion by
suggesting that the analyst thought that the building selected,
though not the arms agency headquarters, may still have been a
legitimate target. In addition to the CIA inquiry, finding answers
will require an unsparing Pentagon investigation as well.
</P>
<P>
   The American people have a right to know what went wrong in this
embarrassing episode and to have credible assurances that the same
mistakes are not likely to happen again.

   CHICAGO _ Just for drama, they spotted their guests a goal on
their first shot. Can't have bored viewers channel-surfing 10
minutes into a match, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Then the US women's soccer team showed the planet once again why
it is odds-on to reclaim the World Cup, scoring six unanswered
goals on bewildered Nigeria by halftime and going on to an absurdly
easy 7-1 triumph Thursday &UR;  &LR; night before a capacity crowd of 65,080
at Soldier Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not the way we want to start a game,'' mused US coach Tony
DiCicco, after his squad calmly turned a shocker into a laugher
with three goals in four minutes. ``But there's no panic in this
team.''

<P>
   The victory, their second in two matches, all but assured the
Americans a place in the quarterfinals and the right to defend
their Olympic title next summer in Sydney. Unless they are utterly
routed by North Korea in Foxborough, Mass., Sunday night and
Nigeria rebounds to crush winless Denmark, the home folks are
through cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Americans expected otherwise. But when the
exuberant Super Falcons stormed into their end and got a goal from
Nkiru Okosieme 73 seconds after the opening whistle, the US got a
wakeup call that felt like a slap in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a blessing in disguise for us,'' said forward Tiffeny
Milbrett, who ended up with a pair of goals. ``It really made us
get angry, really made us alert right away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who had seven players on the field with more than
100 international appearances, quickly settled in and began to
dominate play. By the 23d minute they'd gone up, 3-1, and were
headed for a goalfest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't worried,'' said keeper Briana Scurry, who needed to
make only two saves for the rest of the evening. ``We were getting
at 'em and we had an entire game to play. We came back with a
vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, it was Mia Hamm who brought her teammates back,
setting up the first goal and scoring the second less than a minute
later. The Nigerians didn't need a program to identify the world's
best player. They had been whacking, flattening, and chopping her
down from behind from the moment play began. ``We did our best to
track her down,'' shrugged Nigerian coach Ismaila Mabo. ``But,
unfortunately, she was not tracked down.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm kept rising, kept running, kept creating. And in the 19th
minute she drew the US even with a deft free kick that was
deflected into the far upper corner of the net. Though Michelle
Akers originally was credited with the goal after sliding into the
ball, a replay indicated defending midfielder Ifeanyichukwu
Chiejene had knocked it in for an own goal.
</P>
<P>
   All the Americans cared was that there was a 1 on the
scoreboard. And almost immediately it was a 2, with a wide-open
Hamm taking a feed from Kristine Lilly and blasting it over keeper
Ann Chiejine's upstretched hand. Then Cindy Parlow set up Milbrett
in close for a third goal in the 23d minute, and the rout was on.
``We started playing and we started finishing goals,'' said Lilly.
``And it just snowballed from there.''
</P>
<P>
   That was how the US had envisioned the match evolving. The
Nigerians would be so intent on attacking that they'd be vulnerable
in their own end. ``Field day for our forwards,'' Scurry had
predicted _ and so it was, as the breathless Nigerians stood agape
while their white-jerseyed hosts sliced them up.
</P>
<P>
   In the 32d minute, Hamm swung a free kick toward Lilly, who
headed it in from 3 yards out. In the 39th came Akers again,
putting away a feed from Julie Foudy with a running header. And in
the 42d, a doubleheader for punctuation _ Brandi Chastain to
Parlow. At intermission the Americans had taken seven shots on goal
and scored on six.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time since Sweden scored that many on Japan in
an 8-0 blitz in 1991 that a team had managed half a dozen in a Cup
half. If the Yanks had wanted, they could have gone for a dozen,
but they'd long since made their point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost by one goal to seven but I have no regrets
whatsoever,'' said Mabo, whose side can still advance by beating
the winless Danes in Washington Sunday. ``I know I lost to a better
side, a side that has been together since before women's football
was introduced in Nigeria.''

END OF KINGDOME ERA EVOKES SURPRISINGLY GOOD MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer

<P>
   SEATTLE _ So the bad marriage ends.
</P>
<P>
   After 23 years, major league baseball and the Kingdome are
divorcing.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's dissolution shouldn't be considered the sum total
of the experience.
</P>
<P>
   As many of us know, bad marriages can still produce great kids
and wonderful memories. Unfortunately, it is often the most obvious
and superficial things that stick in the memory.
</P>
<P>
   Ever take adult friends to visit your childhood home? While you
bore them with the homestead's personal wonders, all they can think
of is Betty Davis' trademark line: ``What a dump!''
</P>
<P>
   To them, well, maybe. That's not the point. They didn't live
there. They can't know. So, hey, shut up already.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it is for me when out-of-town sportswriters trash the
concrete blister. Sure, the Kingdome is uglier than a federal tax
penalty. And even if it wasn't, it remains an indoor park. Since so
much of baseball's appeal is sensory, the deprivation-tank quality
suffocates the sporting dilettantes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's OK if I insult the joint. It's not OK if it's
insulted by someone who didn't grow up in the shed, even if the
insult is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   As we all know, if there were no Kingdome, there would have been
no Mariners, no Seahawks, no Final Fours, no motocross, etc. The
problem with that point is it's an expression of functional
rationality about an experience that is fundamentally irrational _
sports fandom.
</P>
<P>
   Logic often has no place in our sporting tastes. So the utility,
economy and history of the building means to many fans as much as,
say, integrity to a Mariners owner.
</P>
<P>
   Say the word multi-purpose, and my first thought is a big,
faceless schoolroom. That was the Kingdome: OK for everything,
special for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of specialness wasn't helped by the fact that the
Mariners/Kingdome marriage seemed to be one long, unending gripe.
</P>
<P>
   From 1977's opening month, when Mariners executives claimed that
the park's dimensions were different than they were led to believe,
the relationship has been acrimonious and often adversarial.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the club, then owned mostly by local businessmen,
actually filed suit against King County over allegedly broken
promises about the building. Poor lighting, schedule conflicts,
lack of office space _ hey, the Mariners even complained about the
ushers' uniforms _ put the franchise borne of a lawsuit back in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 19 years later, the franchise, again owned by local
businessmen, is about to take King County back to court (remarkable
how the two carpetbagging, out-of-state owners, George Argyros and
Jeff Smulyan, never sued the taxpayers).
</P>
<P>
   By the time that suit is resolved, the Kingdome will be a
dustball. Imagine the irony for the King County Council _ it
believed a new ballpark and the Kingdome's murder would end its
misery as landlord for an entertainment business. Then it gets sued
from the grave.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all the bad manners, holiday fights, money disputes and
other familiar familial dysfunctions cannot obscure one startling,
if little appreciated, fact: Not only did baseball live in the
Kingdome, it thrived.
</P>
<P>
   Argyros once described Seattle baseball as ``pouring money down
a rathole.'' Smulyan once said, ``Seattle could draw 4 million and
it still wouldn't work.'' Well, both of those gentlemen profited
handsomely, upon sale, from their Seattle baseball experience, as
will the current owners.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of an industry hell-bent on self-destruction, Seattle
owners and players made it work and made big money. Fans, after a
17-year delay, finally were rewarded with a successful team rich in
marquee figures and destined for a place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Contradicting the dire forecasts of absolutely every single
person in baseball and nearly every local pundit, baseball fans
readily abandoned the heralded Seattle summers once they were given
a good reason to come indoors.
</P>
<P>
   The reason became obvious in September 1995 _ a magnificent run
to glory that forever fires the sports imagination and explains how
the game always rises above its contemptuous business
contentiousness.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional crescendo was reached late in the evening of Oct.
8.
</P>
<P>
   Having been privileged to bear witness to multiple Olympics,
Super Bowls, World Series and NBA Finals, plus many less heralded
but more rewarding events, the most compelling sports moment of my
scribing days came when Ken Griffey Jr. won a 270-foot race that
wiped out not only the New York Yankees but 19 years of baseball
agony.
</P>
<P>
   In the 11th inning of the finale in a deadlocked five-game
series already flush with sprawling drama against the most
legendary team in sports, Griffey's desperate sprint from first
base on Edgar Martinez's double still makes for aspirin-sized
goosebumps whenever my mind drifts into slow-motion replay.
</P>
<P>
   Jeez, I'm misting up, just writing this.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the exultation that the home field of the greatest
non-athletic advantage in American sports nearly imploded, years
before its time. At that moment, a million baseball fans would have
paid a million bucks each to be at the bottom of that delirious
home-plate pig-pile.
</P>
<P>
   If you weren't at the yard, well, you just can't know.
Fortunately, it was merely the best of many splendid baseball
moments experienced by a generation of fans in a place allegedly
unfit for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball in the Kingdome wasn't pretty, wasn't romantic, wasn't
easy on player knees or pitchers' ERAs. For the longest time,
thrills didn't come often or cheaply. Those who weren't a
considerable part of the Seattle generation that grew up there will
assume the marriage didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Let them think what they want. It worked, even thrived. They
can't know what they didn't live.

SAN ANTONIO'S LEGACY RESTS ON WHAT HAPPENS NEXT YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ We have seen enough, really. The Spurs are on the
verge.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence has been quite convincing. They have proved that
they are head and shoulders above the rest of the NBA this season.
Literally.
</P>
<P>
   That is why there will be no skepticism when the Spurs win their
first-ever NBA championship, which could come as early as Friday
night, even though the relentless Knicks are hell-bent on
preventing a San Antonio celebration on the hallowed hardwood at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   But no team has ever come back from 3-1 in the Finals. Not once.
Never. So see you later Latrell Sprewell and Larry Johnson. It's
been good to know you.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they bring that trophy in (Friday), guys are just going
to be looking at it and want hold it. That's why we feel we have
one more 48-minute game, let's go out there and get it done,''
Spurs guard Mario Elie said Thursday, not afraid to suggest that
the Spurs intend to put the Knicks away as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Tim Duncan, who is a lock for Finals MVP, and David
Robinson all but sealed the Spurs' fate in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   All those rebounds. All that scoring. Duncan kissed the glass so
often he should crop up in Blistex ads sometime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Either that or they're going to start carving his plaque for
Springfield, Mass., because of the way Duncan can handle the ball,
his emotions and the moment.
</P>
<P>
   But is this the start of something _ if you'll pardon the
expression _ big and bigger for the Spurs?
</P>
<P>
   Or is this a one-time thing, which seems just as likely,
considering the questions surrounding the Spurs' future in San
Antonio and Duncan's future with the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens in South Texas, when the Spurs become the NBA's
newest title winners, they'll have a ways to go before they can
truly claim to be heirs apparent to the throne _ Sir Air's throne,
that is.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan is gone, and the Bulls are just a memory, but
what a blazing image they have left with us.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to win a title. Seven NBA franchises have won a
single title. Those are the Bucks, Blazers, Rochester
Royals/Sacramento Kings, St. Louis/Atlanta Hawks, Sonics, the
Washington Bullets and the defunct Baltimore Bullets.
</P>
<P>
   But all of those single-title winners earned their championships
before the 1979-80 season.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with that season, NBA championships belonged
exclusively to the Celtics and Lakers, the Bad Boys in Detroit and
then the Bulls. Houston, with Hakeem Olajuwon, won the two NBA
titles up for grabs in 1993 and '94 when Jordan was retired or
otherwise distracted by baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, the standard that's been set over the past two
decades has been all about consistency, about establishing a
dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of longevity and tenacity is not lost on anyone,
especially the fellas who have first-hand knowledge of what kind of
championship legacy Jordan and the Bulls (and all those other
dynasties) have left lingering.
</P>
<P>
   It is really tough to be ga-ga over a single title run in a
nutball 50-game, lockout-shortened season when Jordan and Co. won
those six titles in two back-to-back campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer sufficient just to win titles. It is far better
to set a mandate for what it takes to be unbeata-Bull.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kerr may be heading to another ring with San Antonio right
now, but even this former Bull said he could not pick the Spurs to
beat his former team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't bet against Michael. No one ever beat him So
because of that, I would say it would be an interesting matchup,''
Kerr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bulls would have had to deal with Tim and David, and for
us, we'd have to deal with Michael and Scottie (Pippen). Mario Elie
would have to guard Michael. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Perdue, another Bulls alum, said he, Kerr and Elie have
shown the rest of the Spurs their championship rings. The Spurs
have had a healthy curiosity about what it would be like.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the Spurs' focus on breaking through to that elite
class, Perdue said he understands the atmosphere in which the Spurs
are ascending to their first title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe people will say its diminished this year because this is
an abbreviated season. They'll say we only played 50 games, and in
the same breath, they're going to say this is the first season that
Michael had retired. So, I think in order to establish ourselves,
we need to go ahead and win next year,'' Perdue said.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that the Spurs have done themselves proud.
When they clinch the title, it will be validation for a franchise
that has never in its combined 26-year ABA-NBA history even played
in the Finals, let alone won one.
</P>
<P>
   But then the trick is to keep it rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe (in) what we've done and how we've gotten here.
Winning one will instill a confidence in this team that we can do
it,'' Perdue said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I think this team has had for the longest time the
individuals to do it, but for one reason or another there's been
something that's prevented it from doing so. But once you win one,
that kind of eases the tension a little bit. And once you realize
you can win one, it's not that the second one's easier, but you
know your mental approach increases.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, even when the Spurs are holding the trophy,
we'll keep our eyes open for challengers, since the post-Jordan NBA
is still working out its new world order.

DEADLY ILLNESS AND NO HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MICROSOFT TEMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LISA STIFFLER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Christopher Miller's life was on track.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, he made the daily commute from his home in
Seattle's Ballard neighborhood to the Microsoft campus in Redmond.
There, he helped to create the company's hardware department, where
prototypes of equipment including the Microsoft mouse, keyboard and
joysticks are made.
</P>
<P>
   Miller loved his job, made good money and enjoyed raising his
two teenage kids.
</P>
<P>
   Then life took a U-turn.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor last August, the
45-year-old Miller has undergone medical treatment costing more
than $30,000. Each month he takes medications costing hundreds of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was paid directly by Microsoft, he was classified as
one of a few hundred ``independent contractors'' not eligible for
health care benefits. Another 6,000 employees working at Microsoft
are employed by temporary agencies, and also are not eligible for
Microsoft benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Two class-action lawsuits charge that the corporation
misclassified thousands of employees, and they seek retroactive
health insurance, retirement plans and stock purchase programs for
eligible former and current employees.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the workers say the Miller case illustrates why
the Microsoft employee classification system doesn't work. They
argue that Microsoft is ignoring its responsibility to provide
benefits for a segment of its employees, shifting the cost to
individuals and the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Microsoft would grow up and act like the major employer it
is, then Chris Miller could be one of the last Microsoft employees
to face a life-threatening illness without health insurance,'' said
David West, spokesman for the workers' attorneys and director of
the Center for a Changing Workforce, a non-profit organization
advocating for temp workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a panel of 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judges ruled
that temporary workers and independent contractors can participate
in Microsoft's stock purchase program, which lets them buy the
company's stock at a discount.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft sought a rehearing of that ruling by the full court
but was turned down Thursday. A Microsoft spokesman said the
company hasn't yet decided what it will do next.
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of the lawsuits are unresolved, including
entitlement to medical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Miller began working for Microsoft in his modest Ballard house
in 1993. In 1996, he started working at the corporation's Eastside
headquarters, charged with establishing a hardware department at
the company. For 14 months he held a managerial role, and was
instrumental in hiring other employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was treated no differently than anyone else,'' he said.
``Many people ... didn't understand why I wasn't a regular
employee.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft declined comment on Miller's prolonged status as an
independent contractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sympathy goes out to him,'' said spokesman Dan Leach.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Miller once again spends his days at home. He moves
cautiously, his speech is slurred, and he can be confused.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of the tumor came on suddenly. For six months Miller
had been taking Valium for panic attacks that he thought were
caused by stress. Then, over the course of a week, his speech
became slurred and he would at times forget the names of the
children he has raised alone since his 1984 divorce.
</P>
<P>
   A brain scan and tissue biopsy revealed an inoperable tumor that
doctors believe had been growing for as long as 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was told he had at most six months to live.
</P>
<P>
   Only days after his diagnosis, Miller's sister, Leslie Brockman,
wrote a letter to Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates recounting her
brother's devotion to the corporation. She asked for help with his
medical expenses and with the costs of raising his family during
the illness.
</P>
<P>
   A month later Brockman, an elementary school teacher and
administrator in Laguna Beach, Calif., received a response from the
director of Microsoft's contingent staffing. The letter offered
sympathy, but explained that benefits are not offered to employees
of Miller's classification.
</P>
<P>
   When he fell ill, Miller and his children went to California to
be with his sister and mother. There he underwent radiation
treatments that were surprisingly successful, shrinking his tumor
and temporarily restoring his normal behavior and speech. Brockman
raised $8,000 from her church to pay for the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Miller returned to Seattle in October and began a course of
chemotherapy, having already received the maximum dose of radiation
allowed for patients. The chemotherapy appears to be slowing the
tumor's growth, and Miller has already lived four months longer
than doctors thought he would.
</P>
<P>
   Mounting bills have forced Miller to sell many of his
possessions. He gets by on Medicaid, Social Security and support
from the state. The University of Washington has donated his
monthly chemotherapy and bimonthly brain scans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hardships Miller and his family have endured, he
doesn't hold a grudge against his former employer. In fact, he
wants desperately to return to his old job. Miller said he has been
promised a position if, and when, he is well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am uniquely qualified and it's as simple as that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he was well compensated by Microsoft, but did not
buy health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought anything about it. I never expected to use
anything like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller had never been sick, followed a strict vegetarian diet
and said he naively thought health insurance unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Steve Strong is working for the plaintiffs in the
class-action lawsuit. He said Miller's situation is not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who don't have health insurance with their
employer don't get it,'' Strong said.
</P>
<P>
   Individual insurance plans can be expensive and difficult to
get. Individual plan premiums range from $320 to $592 a month for a
family of four with a $250 deductible, according to the state
Insurance Commissioner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Strong warns that as Microsoft's youthful workforce begins
aging, the potential for situations like Miller's will increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``As people get older, there will be more people with major
ailments,'' Strong said.
</P>
<P>
   In early April, Microsoft decreed that to continue doing
business with the company, temporary agencies would be expected to
provide medical and dental insurance to temporary workers, paying
at least half its cost.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also reduced, to 15 from 100, the number of agencies
it contracts with directly, with a view to more easily ensuring
that the agencies comply with the new benefits requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and other high tech companies say they must use
temporary employees because they have fluctuating labor needs. The
computer companies need cyclical help creating and testing new
products and for tech support when a new item is released.
</P>
<P>
   Brockman said her brother has redirected the passion, intensity
and focus that he had for his projects at Microsoft to fight his
illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Chris, (the illness) is just another project to get
through,'' she said. ``But this is a project that I don't know if
he can finish.''

FRANKIE RODRIGUEZ ADAPTS TO RELIEF ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When Frankie Rodriguez pitched for the Minnesota
Twins, he was never certain of his role. He would have some success
starting, then struggle and be shifted to relief. It was
frustrating, he said, a mental grind.
</P>
<P>
   So when Rodriguez was shifted to the Mariners' bullpen this
week, it seemed like a similar scenario. He'd had two solid starts,
then fallen apart Sunday in Cleveland. It was back to the bullpen,
and even Rodriguez wondered how he'd react.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed with myself,'' Rodriguez said. ``I was
wondering, OK, after this bad outing, what's going to happen? Then
I just said: `You know what? Why? You were told what you were going
to do when you first got here.' That made it a lot easier to
handle, because I knew what was expected.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rodriguez was claimed off waivers at the end of May,
manager Lou Piniella told him he was going to middle relief. Now
that he's back in that role, it's no big deal. ``Anything I can do
to contribute,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   If he pitches the way he did Wednesday, earning a three-inning
save in relief of John Halama, he'll contribute plenty. Piniella
thinks Rodriguez can fill the role intended for veteran Mark
Leiter, who is out for the year with a torn rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter was acquired to join Jose Paniagua as an option in the
sixth, seventh and eighth innings. His absence has caused the
Mariners to scramble, trying Ken Cloude, Rafael Carmona, even Jeff
Fassero _ however briefly _ in that role.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I was so pleased with the job Frankie did
(Wednesday),'' Piniella said. ``To me, that was impressive. We need
a couple of pitchers to do that type of job for us. It'll allow me
to keep Paniagua nice and rested and not have to lean on him
entirely. He's the one I've had to overuse a little at times, even
though he likes to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella said his goal is to keep each pitcher in a specific
role. Friday night's starter, Paul Abbott, will be the Mariners'
21st pitcher already, but Piniella said he's ``getting closer'' to
finding the right combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to put a staff together that we can grow with and
have pitchers in specific roles,'' Piniella said. ``We thought that
Rodriguez, of all the pitchers that we have here, would fit in that
middle to set-up type situation, and his arm bounces back very
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to put something here that we don't have to
tinker with anymore. Naturally, it depends on how pitchers pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   When Abbott is officially added to the roster today,
right-hander Aaron Scheffer will be sent to Class AAA Tacoma. The
Mariners still could use another left-hander in the bullpen, and
Piniella said the club would consider bringing back Sean Spencer or
Jordan Zimmerman, or promoting Damaso Marte for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're watching their progress carefully,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DOME FAN: Count Matt Walbeck as one player who's sorry to see
the Kingdome go. When the Anaheim Angels catcher was 9 years old,
he and his dad drove up from their home in Sacramento for the 1979
All-Star Game. He saw batting practice from above the right field
wall, and got a souvenir from an Orioles coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Ray Miller for a ball, and he threw it to me. I was
stoked,'' Walbeck said. ``I love it here. I love hitting here. I
always have. Out of all the domes, this is my favorite one.''
</P>
<P>
   AROUND THE HORN: First baseman David Segui was cleared to play
last night after missing two games with fluid in his left knee, but
received an extra day of rest. ... Why were songs like ``Evenflow''
and ``Jeremy'' playing from the Kingdome loudspeakers before last
night's game? Must have been the shaggy-haired friend of Jack
McDowell on the Angels bench. Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder took some
batting practice as he visited the Angels' pitcher/musician. ...
The Mariners should surpass the 1 million mark in attendance Friday
night. The club failed to attract 1 million fans all year from
1978-81 and from 1983-84. ... A total of 3,623 fans took part in
``Buhner Buzz Night'' at the Kingdome Thursday night. Of those, 443
were already bald, and the remainder had their heads shaved _
including 56 women, a new record. In the six years of the event,
16,056 chrome-domes have packed the Kingdome.

DEADLY ILLNESS AND NO HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MICROSOFT TEMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LISA STIFFLER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Christopher Miller's life was on track.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, he made the daily commute from his home in
Seattle's Ballard neighborhood to the Microsoft campus in Redmond.
There, he helped to create the company's hardware department, where
prototypes of equipment including the Microsoft mouse, keyboard and
joysticks are made.
</P>
<P>
   Miller loved his job, made good money and enjoyed raising his
two teenage kids.
</P>
<P>
   Then life took a U-turn.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor last August, the
45-year-old Miller has undergone medical treatment costing more
than $30,000. Each month he takes medications costing hundreds of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was paid directly by Microsoft, he was classified as
one of a few hundred ``independent contractors'' not eligible for
health care benefits. Another 6,000 employees working at Microsoft
are employed by temporary agencies, and also are not eligible for
Microsoft benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Two class-action lawsuits charge that the corporation
misclassified thousands of employees, and they seek retroactive
health insurance, retirement plans and stock purchase programs for
eligible former and current employees.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the workers say the Miller case illustrates why
the Microsoft employee classification system doesn't work. They
argue that Microsoft is ignoring its responsibility to provide
benefits for a segment of its employees, shifting the cost to
individuals and the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Microsoft would grow up and act like the major employer it
is, then Chris Miller could be one of the last Microsoft employees
to face a life-threatening illness without health insurance,'' said
David West, spokesman for the workers' attorneys and director of
the Center for a Changing Workforce, a non-profit organization
advocating for temp workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a panel of 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judges ruled
that temporary workers and independent contractors can participate
in Microsoft's stock purchase program, which lets them buy the
company's stock at a discount.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft sought a rehearing of that ruling by the full court
but was turned down Thursday. A Microsoft spokesman said the
company hasn't yet decided what it will do next.
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of the lawsuits are unresolved, including
entitlement to medical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Miller began working for Microsoft in his modest Ballard house
in 1993. In 1996, he started working at the corporation's Eastside
headquarters, charged with establishing a hardware department at
the company. For 14 months he held a managerial role, and was
instrumental in hiring other employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was treated no differently than anyone else,'' he said.
``Many people ... didn't understand why I wasn't a regular
employee.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft declined comment on Miller's prolonged status as an
independent contractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sympathy goes out to him,'' said spokesman Dan Leach.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Miller once again spends his days at home. He moves
cautiously, his speech is slurred, and he can be confused.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of the tumor came on suddenly. For six months Miller
had been taking Valium for panic attacks that he thought were
caused by stress. Then, over the course of a week, his speech
became slurred and he would at times forget the names of the
children he has raised alone since his 1984 divorce.
</P>
<P>
   A brain scan and tissue biopsy revealed an inoperable tumor that
doctors believe had been growing for as long as 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was told he had at most six months to live.
</P>
<P>
   Only days after his diagnosis, Miller's sister, Leslie Brockman,
wrote a letter to Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates recounting her
brother's devotion to the corporation. She asked for help with his
medical expenses and with the costs of raising his family during
the illness.
</P>
<P>
   A month later Brockman, an elementary school teacher and
administrator in Laguna Beach, Calif., received a response from the
director of Microsoft's contingent staffing. The letter offered
sympathy, but explained that benefits are not offered to employees
of Miller's classification.
</P>
<P>
   When he fell ill, Miller and his children went to California to
be with his sister and mother. There he underwent radiation
treatments that were surprisingly successful, shrinking his tumor
and temporarily restoring his normal behavior and speech. Brockman
raised $8,000 from her church to pay for the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Miller returned to Seattle in October and began a course of
chemotherapy, having already received the maximum dose of radiation
allowed for patients. The chemotherapy appears to be slowing the
tumor's growth, and Miller has already lived four months longer
than doctors thought he would.
</P>
<P>
   Mounting bills have forced Miller to sell many of his
possessions. He gets by on Medicaid, Social Security and support
from the state. The University of Washington has donated his
monthly chemotherapy and bimonthly brain scans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hardships Miller and his family have endured, he
doesn't hold a grudge against his former employer. In fact, he
wants desperately to return to his old job. Miller said he has been
promised a position if, and when, he is well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am uniquely qualified and it's as simple as that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he was well compensated by Microsoft, but did not
buy health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought anything about it. I never expected to use
anything like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller had never been sick, followed a strict vegetarian diet
and said he naively thought health insurance unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Steve Strong is working for the plaintiffs in the
class-action lawsuit. He said Miller's situation is not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who don't have health insurance with their
employer don't get it,'' Strong said.
</P>
<P>
   Individual insurance plans can be expensive and difficult to
get. Individual plan premiums range from $320 to $592 a month for a
family of four with a $250 deductible, according to the state
Insurance Commissioner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Strong warns that as Microsoft's youthful workforce begins
aging, the potential for situations like Miller's will increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``As people get older, there will be more people with major
ailments,'' Strong said.
</P>
<P>
   In early April, Microsoft decreed that to continue doing
business with the company, temporary agencies would be expected to
provide medical and dental insurance to temporary workers, paying
at least half its cost.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also reduced, to 15 from 100, the number of agencies
it contracts with directly, with a view to more easily ensuring
that the agencies comply with the new benefits requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and other high tech companies say they must use
temporary employees because they have fluctuating labor needs. The
computer companies need cyclical help creating and testing new
products and for tech support when a new item is released.
</P>
<P>
   Brockman said her brother has redirected the passion, intensity
and focus that he had for his projects at Microsoft to fight his
illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Chris, (the illness) is just another project to get
through,'' she said. ``But this is a project that I don't know if
he can finish.''

EDITORIAL: UNIONIZED MEDICINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Medical Association has taken on the managed care
industry with its vote to create an affiliated labor union for
doctors who are salaried employees. The decision was surprising for
a hidebound organization whose members have traditionally and
sometimes arrogantly presented themselves as part of an elite
profession as opposed to members of a workers' group. But
unionization seems inevitable as doctors seek ways to recover their
clout against powerful health plans. For consumers, unionization
may be a positive force if doctors use collective bargaining to
negotiate for improved patient services rather than merely for
higher physician pay.
</P>
<P>
   One out of seven doctors are now employees working for others,
compared with earlier decades when nearly all doctors were
self-employed businessmen who set their own fees. Consolidation and
the rise of corporate-run networks serving hundreds of thousands of
patients have also reduced the autonomy of independent doctors who
contract with insurers to provide medical services. Frustration
with managed care has caused many to seek a collective voice in
dealing with health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA move comes at a time when unionization of doctors is
already growing. More than 40,000 doctors who are employees of
HMOs, hospitals and public institutions are members of other unions
representing service workers and government employees. The AMA
entry into the union movement will probably increase those numbers
by giving doctors their own union, one governed by the profession's
principles. The organization has properly pledged that its union,
unlike other unions, will never strike, and will not focus on
matters like pay and job security. Instead it says the union would
allow employee-doctors a way to challenge restrictions on patient
services.
</P>
<P>
   Federal antitrust law prevents the AMA union from representing
self-employed doctors. But the association is strongly pushing for
a bill in the House that would provide an antitrust exemption to
allow independent doctors to band together to bargain collectively
with health plans and insurers. The implications of such a change
must be carefully examined by Congress. Some states are moving in
this direction. Texas recently passed a law to give self-employed
doctors more bargaining leverage.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid shift in the medical marketplace has been driven
largely by employers and insurers eager to hold down high medical
costs. For the most part, doctors have been bewildered observers of
the upheaval. The AMA's action shows that the profession is no
longer willing to stay out of the game. If doctors use collective
bargaining to improve patient care standards, unionization may turn
out to be a strong force against health plans that unfairly use
their market power to limit quality of care.

CORRECTS SPELLING OF CHRIS VAN DYK FROM VAN DYKE  
 STADIUM DISTRICT TO MARINERS: NO TO REQUEST ON COST OVERRUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN SNEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Seattle Mariners' request for help in paying $100
million in Safeco Field cost overruns was met Thursday with a stern
reply: No way.
</P>
<P>
   The state panel overseeing construction of the $517 million
ballpark told the Mariners baseball team it is not willing to have
a mediator help determine who should pay cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not moving on this issue. As far as I'm concerned,
there's no way we're going to ask for more money'' from King
County, said Ron Judd, a member of the Public Facilities District
board.
</P>
<P>
   The ballclub's owners asked this week that $60 million from
excess ballpark tax surpluses be used to help offset the estimated
$100 million in cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears neither side is willing to budge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way to compromise,'' said Gerry Johnson, the PFD's
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Added PFD board member Bob Wallace: ``Normally in mediation you
have money involved, and the mediator beats up both sides and goes
back and forth until there is an agreement. But this is not a
split-the-baby kind of issue. It's a `what-does-the-law-say' issue.
</P>
<P>
   The PFD board's decision was unanimous after an hour-long,
closed-door session called to discuss a ``threat of litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a correct, proper and courageous decision,'' said
Chris Van Dyk, co-founder of Citizens for More Important Things, an
anti-stadium tax group.
</P>
<P>
   County Executive Ron Sims agreed, saying ``there is no need to
mediate something (the M's) contract does not entitle them to
have.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, in a written statement, were disappointmented and
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mediation is used routinely in this country to resolve complex
legal and business disputes. We had sought mediation so the
Mariners and the PFD could, with the assistance of a neutral third
party, attempt to resolve our conflicting views of the legislation,
our contract and other issues,'' the club said.
</P>
<P>
   The team's options include asking a court to compel the PFD to
join in mediation, although the contractual agreement between the
team and the district does not require binding mediation or
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   The team also could sue over the money it-
</P>
<P>
   self.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have not said what their plans are, and Thursday
would say nothing more than the written statement.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, Nintendo of America Inc. Chairman Howard Lincoln
hinted that the team wouldn't back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize there's a lot of people who don't agree with us,''
Lincoln said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even baseball owners are entitled to their day in court.''
Nintendon of America is the team's majority owner.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the $417 million construction budget set in July
1997, the Mariners agreed to pay $45 million while the public share
would be $372 million.
</P>
<P>
   The public funds would come from taxes on restaurant meals,
rental cars and ballpark admissions; a sales tax credit; and some
state lottery sales.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariners say a study by an investment banker the team
declines to identify showed higher-than-projected tax revenues
could allow the state to issue bonds to generate another $60
million to help cover the $100 million in cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   The team would agree to pay the other $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Ellis and Lincoln interpreted language in the 1995
state stadium financing law and the 1997 development agreement
between the team and the PFD to say the dis-
</P>
<P>
   trict is obliged to ask the county to float bonds when there is
a surplus of ballpark-related tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, PFD executive Director Ken Johnsen cited the same
documents in an analysis that argues the team is required to pay
all costs in addition to $417 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public's contribution to the project was capped at $372
million at the time that the PFD and the Mariners agreed on a
construction budget and King County issued the requisite amount of
bonds to support construction,'' Johnsen wrote in a memo to the PFD
board.
</P>
<P>
   He said state legislation requires extra tax revenues go for
early debt retirement and prohibits using public money for ``cost
overruns on initial construction.''
</P>
<P>
   He also cited King County ordinances authorizing the bonds that
forbids the refinancing requested by the Mariners and said it would
be an unconstitutional gift of public funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to imagine how agreements that describe the
Mariners' responsibility for all `cost overruns' or `supplemental
funds' could be more clear,'' Johnsen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Sims said the Mariners want windfall revenue that should be used
to retire the bonds early.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the question is, where will the benefits of our booming
economy go _ to the taxpayers or the Mariners?'' Sims asked.
</P>
<P>
   Sims' office received about 150 telephone calls and e-mail
messages about the dispute Wednesday and Thursday _ all of them
anti-Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyk said the Mariners' position relies on legal language
taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
   He said the team cited a reference that first appeared in a
state Supreme Court brief filed by the PFD and King County in 1997
in response to an appeal by the group, Citizens for More Important
Things.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the team is trying to use information furnished by
the stadium district in an unrelated case against the PFD in the
current dispute, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely the sleaziest trick in the business,'' Van Dyk
said. ``Any company that acted so cavalierly about their public
image and so discounted the value of good will and was in a retail
entertainment business, I would sell short their stock now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hattori, the county's financial adviser on the ballpark
bonds, recalled that Mariners' attorneys and finan-
</P>
<P>
   cial consultants attended all County Council meetings on the
stadium bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time during any of those discussions did they ever raise
the idea that the county would be required to issue additional
bonds,'' Hattori said.
</P>
<P>
   The PFD session drew two speakers. Kit Hawkins, a lobbyist for
the 4,000-member Washington Restaurant Association, said the
ballpark benefits relatively few restaurants and some owners
already regret supporting the stadium financing deal.
</P>
<P>
   And Vincent Koskela, a representative from Taxpayers on Strike,
said he was disgusted with the Mariners.

<P>
   Big international companies often seem to be operating on
autopilot, and are therefore slow to sense when something has gone
badly wrong that threatens not only immediate losses but the
company's reputation, which is a brand-name company's most
important asset.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, the most recent company to face such a problem,
reacted slowly but adequately to a crisis that erupted in Europe
when _ by the company's account _ unrelated problems at two plants
produced sodas that smelled and tasted terrible. Doctors say the
numerous reports of illness may have had more to do with mass
hysteria than with the defects in the products.
</P>
<P>
   The gold standard of reacting to crisis was set in 1982 by
Johnson &AMP; Johnson after its Tylenol pain reliever was suspected of
containing poison. It immediately recalled the product and appeared
to be more interested in getting to the bottom of the situation
than in short-term profits. Eventually it developed that Johnson &AMP;
Johnson was in no way to blame for the problem, which was traced to
criminal tampering. By contrast, the Exxon Corp. was slow to react
after its Exxon Valdez tanker ran aground in Alaskan waters. Top
management seemed to think it was someone else's problem, and by
the time Exxon took effective action its image had been tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's performance seems to have been somewhere between
these two. It promptly recalled some bottles, but did not extend
the recall to all its products until forced to do so by the Belgian
government. Its top management was slow to get publicly involved,
thereby offending Belgian officials and citizens, but over all it
appears to have acted responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   M. Douglas Ivester, the chief executive, said in Brussels that
his company believed that ``nothing is more important than
protecting the public health,'' and added that its products ``are
completely safe.'' Given the clear breakdown in quality control at
two different plants, Coca-Cola needs to better explain why it
failed to detect the problems and what it has done to prevent a
recurrence.

SAN MANUEL COPPER SMELTER AND MINE TO CLOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JANE LARSON  
 and MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN MANUEL, Ariz. _ Pummeled by the lowest copper prices in 12
years, Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. announced Thursday that it
will shut its smelter and underground copper mine and lay off
nearly 2,200 workers here.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian mining conglomerate will also close its Nevada
mine, for a total of 2,630 layoffs by the end of August. About 430
employees will continue to work at the rod plant in San Manuel and
at copper-processing plants there and at its mine outside
Globe-Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``BHP cannot continue to operate in these financial
circumstances,'' Doug McGregor, president of BHP Copper North
America, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Copper prices have averaged 65 cents a pound this year, a 46
percent drop from the heady $1.22 of two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The shutdown decision came as BHP, based in Melbourne, announced
that it lost 2.3 billion Australian dollars in the year that ended
May 31, due to the restructuring. Without those charges, the
company would have posted a profit of 365 million Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian dollar has been trading at about 65 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the closing hit like a ton of bricks at dusk as parents
gathered at San Manuel's Little League baseball field to watch a
practice session for the town's 9- and 10-year-old All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Gomez, 47, a pipefitter for 25 years, stared vacantly at
the field. A voice yelled out that his boy doubled. Gomez hadn't
noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to make my break from this,'' he said, slowly and
unconvincingly. ``I mean, I'm a plumber, I can install commodes. I
can pay $10,000 and get bonded and do small commercial work.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he lapsed back into mine talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother is a foreman at the mine in Tyrone, New Mexico, and
he always said that they need fitters and he would take care of
me,'' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   The news that the mine would close came on the heels of an
increased presence of law officers near the mine entrance. Workers
said that they had been sent home from work Wednesday after a
threat was phoned in to bomb the mine.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Viramontes, a crane operator, said he was called in with
dozens of other workers to the mine's control room halfway through
his shift Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just said go home and don't come back and that they would
call us next week. It was all very matter-of-fact,'' Viramontes
said.
</P>
<P>
   BHP bought the San Manuel and Pinto Valley properties in 1996 as
part of its acquisition of Tucson-based Magma Copper Co.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have long believed BHP paid too much for the
properties, bought when copper prices were high and BHP wanted into
the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   It had been looking for a buyer, particularly for the
world-class San Manuel smelter, but no copper companies were
jumping at the chance in a slumping market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know somebody who has a desire to buy at a great price,
I'll talk to them today,'' BHP Managing Director Paul Anderson told
a Melbourne news conference. In a more robust copper market, the
U.S. properties would be attractive and BHP would have buyers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He held out little hope the properties would be reopened soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the price of copper went up to $1 tomorrow, we'd be opening
the mines,'' he said. But he also later said he would prefer to
invest in the company's Chilean mine over the higher-cost U.S.
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson joined the struggling conglomerate last year with a vow
to make cuts and refocus its business.
</P>
<P>
   Other copper companies and the industry worldwide had been
awaiting his action, in hopes it would reduce a global oversupply
of copper and boost prices.
</P>
<P>
   BHP's announcement sent copper prices and BHP stock up sharply
in early trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the circumstances, it's the right thing to do,'' said
Timothy Snider, president of Phelps Dodge Mining Co., the mining
side of Phoenix-based Phelps Dodge Corp., another major player in
the industry. ``It shows some leadership, and we think it will help
the business.''
</P>
<P>
   In its announcement, BHP said it will place the U.S. mines and
smelter on ``care and maintenance,'' meaning they could be reopened
if prices improve.
</P>
<P>
   BHP, which started a $54 million upgrade on the San Manuel
smelter in May, said it will complete the upgrade and then put it
in care and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The shutdowns will be phased in over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas will suspend operations immediately, BHP said, and
hourly workers will be placed on paid leave until the plans are
complete. Salaried workers will continue to report over the next 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   Employees will receive normal pay and benefits for 60 days, in
addition to the interim leave. The company also will provide career
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize the impact the cessation will have on employees,
and we are committed to helping those affected to pursue their next
career move,'' McGregor said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the Greater Tucson Economic Council said there
are job possibilities in Tucson, 40 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we absorb it? Yes, we can, but people would have to be
retrained,'' said Sandy Garcia, vice president of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   A man sitting on the tailgate of a pickup near the San Manuel
baseball field was skeptical. He set off a round of groans from his
buddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess Tucson is about to get flooded, ain't it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not going to be a job left north of downtown. Home
Depot sure is looking good about now.'' &QL;

SAN MANUEL COPPER SMELTER AND MINE TO CLOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JANE LARSON  
 and MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN MANUEL, Ariz. _ Pummeled by the lowest copper prices in 12
years, Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. announced Thursday that it
will shut its smelter and underground copper mine and lay off
nearly 2,200 workers here.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian mining conglomerate will also close its Nevada
mine, for a total of 2,630 layoffs by the end of August. About 430
employees will continue to work at the rod plant in San Manuel and
at copper-processing plants there and at its mine outside
Globe-Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``BHP cannot continue to operate in these financial
circumstances,'' Doug McGregor, president of BHP Copper North
America, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Copper prices have averaged 65 cents a pound this year, a 46
percent drop from the heady $1.22 of two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The shutdown decision came as BHP, based in Melbourne, announced
that it lost 2.3 billion Australian dollars in the year that ended
May 31, due to the restructuring. Without those charges, the
company would have posted a profit of 365 million Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian dollar has been trading at about 65 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the closing hit like a ton of bricks at dusk as parents
gathered at San Manuel's Little League baseball field to watch a
practice session for the town's 9- and 10-year-old All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Gomez, 47, a pipefitter for 25 years, stared vacantly at
the field. A voice yelled out that his boy doubled. Gomez hadn't
noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to make my break from this,'' he said, slowly and
unconvincingly. ``I mean, I'm a plumber, I can install commodes. I
can pay $10,000 and get bonded and do small commercial work.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he lapsed back into mine talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother is a foreman at the mine in Tyrone, New Mexico, and
he always said that they need fitters and he would take care of
me,'' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   The news that the mine would close came on the heels of an
increased presence of law officers near the mine entrance. Workers
said that they had been sent home from work Wednesday after a
threat was phoned in to bomb the mine.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Viramontes, a crane operator, said he was called in with
dozens of other workers to the mine's control room halfway through
his shift Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just said go home and don't come back and that they would
call us next week. It was all very matter-of-fact,'' Viramontes
said.
</P>
<P>
   BHP bought the San Manuel and Pinto Valley properties in 1996 as
part of its acquisition of Tucson-based Magma Copper Co.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have long believed BHP paid too much for the
properties, bought when copper prices were high and BHP wanted into
the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   It had been looking for a buyer, particularly for the
world-class San Manuel smelter, but no copper companies were
jumping at the chance in a slumping market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know somebody who has a desire to buy at a great price,
I'll talk to them today,'' BHP Managing Director Paul Anderson told
a Melbourne news conference. In a more robust copper market, the
U.S. properties would be attractive and BHP would have buyers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He held out little hope the properties would be reopened soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the price of copper went up to $1 tomorrow, we'd be opening
the mines,'' he said. But he also later said he would prefer to
invest in the company's Chilean mine over the higher-cost U.S.
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson joined the struggling conglomerate last year with a vow
to make cuts and refocus its business.
</P>
<P>
   Other copper companies and the industry worldwide had been
awaiting his action, in hopes it would reduce a global oversupply
of copper and boost prices.
</P>
<P>
   BHP's announcement sent copper prices and BHP stock up sharply
in early trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the circumstances, it's the right thing to do,'' said
Timothy Snider, president of Phelps Dodge Mining Co., the mining
side of Phoenix-based Phelps Dodge Corp., another major player in
the industry. ``It shows some leadership, and we think it will help
the business.''
</P>
<P>
   In its announcement, BHP said it will place the U.S. mines and
smelter on ``care and maintenance,'' meaning they could be reopened
if prices improve.
</P>
<P>
   BHP, which started a $54 million upgrade on the San Manuel
smelter in May, said it will complete the upgrade and then put it
in care and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The shutdowns will be phased in over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas will suspend operations immediately, BHP said, and
hourly workers will be placed on paid leave until the plans are
complete. Salaried workers will continue to report over the next 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   Employees will receive normal pay and benefits for 60 days, in
addition to the interim leave. The company also will provide career
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize the impact the cessation will have on employees,
and we are committed to helping those affected to pursue their next
career move,'' McGregor said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the Greater Tucson Economic Council said there
are job possibilities in Tucson, 40 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we absorb it? Yes, we can, but people would have to be
retrained,'' said Sandy Garcia, vice president of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   A man sitting on the tailgate of a pickup near the San Manuel
baseball field was skeptical. He set off a round of groans from his
buddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess Tucson is about to get flooded, ain't it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not going to be a job left north of downtown. Home
Depot sure is looking good about now.'' &QL;

VAUGHN JOLTS MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Mariners manager Lou Piniella sat in his office before
Thursday night's game and considered his new starting rotation.
With Jamie Moyer, Freddy Garcia, John Halama, Jeff Fassero and Paul
Abbott, Piniella said, the Mariners could start winning
consistently.
</P>
<P>
   But he added a warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the games up here are won from the sixth inning on,''
Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't know how accurate he'd be.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' late-game foundation has shown signs of cracking
this month, and the whole thing crumbled Thursday night in two
horrific innings against the Anaheim Angels. The Angels scored nine
unanswered runs after the seventh inning, spoiling a strong effort
by Fassero, and left with a 12-7 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I have to say about this ballgame is, if we
keep walking three hitters in the eighth inning, like we did
tonight, and we did in Cleveland, you're not going to win too many
ballgames,'' Piniella said. ``That's all I've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading 7-3, Jose Paniagua retired the first Angels hitter in
the eighth. But a single and two walks loaded the bases, and
Piniella called on closer Jose Mesa, who failed in his only
previous attempt at a five-out save.
</P>
<P>
   He would not get one this time, either. Mesa walked Darin Erstad
to bring in one run. Randy Velarde followed with his fifth hit, a
single that scored two runs. Matt Luke scored the second run by
beating the throw from Charles Gipson, who had replaced center
fielder Ken Griffey Jr. Piniella said Griffey Jr. was dizzy and had
a bad cold.
</P>
<P>
   That made the score 7-6 Mariners, and it stayed that way for
about three seconds. Mo Vaughn smoked Mesa's first pitch 423 feet
to right-center, and the three-run homer gave the Angels a 9-7
lead. Mesa, who was roundly booed by his old fans in Cleveland in
his last outing, was booed by his new fans as he was pulled for Ken
Cloude two batters later.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua and Mesa, so reliable over the first two months, have
not been sharp lately. Paniagua has been scored on in four of his
last five outings, allowing seven earned runs in six innings. Mesa
has been scored on in five of his last six games, with seven runs
allowed in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa, who converted his first 12 save opportunities, has blown
two of four. Paniagua's earned-run average is 3.92, the highest
it's been all season.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't the only struggling Mariners relievers. Coming in to
keep things close with two outs in the ninth, Allen Watson
surrendered a mammoth three-run homer to Vaughn, his fifth hit of
the night.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those runs were charged to Cloude, who has given up at
least two runs in five of his seven outings since leaving the
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, acquired last Friday in the trade that sent Mac Suzuki
to the New York Mets, has pitched in three games for Seattle. In
each of them, he has allowed a home run to the leadoff hitter, and
in three Mariner innings, he has allowed five homers. Watson is the
only left-hander in the Mariners' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen blowup not only spoiled Fassero's outing, but cost
the Mariners a game in the standings. For the first time in nine
games, the M's had a different result than the division-leading
Texas Rangers, who beat Oakland 5-2 yesterday and come to the
Kingdome Friday night with a five-game lead on Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what comes out tomorrow,'' Fassero said. ``You can't
tell until we show up tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero was pitching for the third time in four days, having
worked briefly in relief on Monday and Tuesday. He was re-inserted
in the rotation one turn earlier than expected, and Piniella did
not want to extend him much past 90 pitches. Fassero allowed a
two-run homer to Velarde in the third and one more run in the
fifth, but overall was solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The loss is) something you live with,'' said Fassero, who
said his concentration was better Thursday night. ``Maybe it's time
for the starters to pick (the relievers) up a little bit, with more
seven- or eight-inning stints.''
</P>
<P>
   In six innings, he allowed six hits and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim starter Chuck Finley, who normally masters the Mariners,
lasted just four innings, allowing seven runs on six hits.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the damage came from Mariners shortstop Alex Rodriguez,
who had a homer and two singles off the Angels' ace. Rodriguez had
just four hits in 24 career at-bats off Finley coming into the
game, but singled in the first to advance Brian Hunter, singled in
the second to drive in Gipson, and drilled a two-run homer in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The home run was Rodriguez's 12th of the season, and gave the
Mariners a 7-2 lead.

HOWARD AND PHIL'S CLOTHING CHAIN ACCUSED OF FRAUD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The largest creditor of a defunct retail clothing
chain co-owned by U.S. Rep. Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon has accused
the company -- and most of its owners -- of fraud and
misrepresentation.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations are part of a civil suit filed in Los Angeles
Superior Court Wednesday by Coast Business Credit, a division of
Southern Pacific Bank. Coast claims McKeon's four brothers, all
part-owners of Howard and Phil's Western Wear, owe it about $4
million.
</P>
<P>
   Under a preliminary sale agreement, expected to be finalized
Friday, Coast will receive roughly $550,000 for the remaining
assets of the broken company. But that is just a fraction of the
money Coast says it is owed, and in its suit it seeks to foreclose
on homes owned by the four brothers to cover part of the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   In its suit, Coast says Howard and Phil's ``deliberately
overstated the value and/or amount of the finished goods inventory
... with the intent to deceive Coast'' into giving it large cash
advances.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says Joseph B. McKeon, John D. McKeon, Monte B. McKeon
and Timothy McKeon ``participated and conspired in the submission
of false reports to Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   The McKeon brothers were unavailable for comment Thursday, but
Janet McKeon, wife of John McKeon, said she was confident the
issues could be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they are workable just because of the quality and the
character of John and his brothers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Repayment of the remaining debt is still open to discussion
outside of court, said Coast Vice President Richard Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always amenable to negotiations,'' Gomez said. ``It's up
to the McKeons to make an offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressman McKeon, a Republican from Santa Clarita, was not
named in the suit because he was not a guarantor of the company,
said Robert E. Freitas, lead attorney for Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our present understanding that he was not involved in the
management of the business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Freitas declined to comment on whether the congressman could
later be added to the suit if Coast decides he was involved in the
company's management.
</P>
<P>
   Canyon Country-based Howard and Phil's closed last month after
years of struggling through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   The company signed over its remaining boots, clothing and other
merchandise to an assignee, and Coast Vice President Gomez said
Montana Boot Co. has agreed to buy those assets for $550,000.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price, while far below the retail value of the
merchandise, ``was probably the best that could be gotten under the
circumstances,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Money raised from the asset sale will be credited toward the $4
million that Coast is seeking in the lawsuit, Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard and Phil's was founded in 1962 by the parents of the
McKeon brothers. At its height, the company had 52 stores across
the county.
</P>
<P>
   But Howard and Phil's began a steep decline in the mid-'90s, and
in 1996 was forced to file for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   It failed to make required debt payments last year, and the
company closed its nine remaining stores in May.
</P>
<P>
   Six workers have filed state wage claims against the company
worth $8,244. Most of those claims will be heard July 13 at the Van
Nuys office of the state labor commissioner.

PADRES EDGE DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _The body language is showing the toll that losing
is taking on the Los Angeles Dodgers. The jump in their step is
gone, and after sliding or diving after balls, it's taken time to
pull their bodies up again.
</P>
<P>
   They say it can't get worse than the mishaps of two weeks ago in
Oakland, or of Kevin Brown forgetting how many outs there were and
letting a run score.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the follies are fewer, but the results are the same.
It's not getting worse, but it certainly is getting no better.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers hoped to turn things around on their longest
homestand of the year. Instead, San Diego completed a three-game
sweep with a 2-1 win Thursday at Dodger Stadium. The Dodgers went
3-6 on the homestand.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (32-38) and Padres (31-38) are tied for last in
National League West in the loss column. By the end of today, the
$80 million underachieving Boys in Blue might be dead last in the
division.
</P>
<P>
   But that really doesn't matter. If the Dodgers were in second
place, it wouldn't quite matter right now, not with the way they're
playing. This isn't about where they stand with other teams but
rather where they rate themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours off the disabled list, Padres right-hander Andy Ashby
(7-4) retired the first 11 Dodgers he faced and allowed four hits
in six-plus innings. Gary Sheffield broke up any early thoughts of
history with a single to left in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers didn't get a runner to second base until Eric Young
reached on an error and stole with two outs in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   An inning later the Dodgers' offensive offense was in full
bloom. Gary Sheffield walked, Raul Mondesi singled and Todd
Hollandsworth singled to pull the Dodgers within 2-1. Donne Wall
relieved Ashby and got Eric Karros on a weak pop-up and got Jose
Vizcaino to ground back to the mound for a fielder's choice.
Pinch-hitter Devon White ended the inning with another weak pop-up.
</P>
<P>
   Padres right-hander Dan Miceli pitched the ninth for his first
save, though it was somewhat eventful. Hollandsworth singled with
two outs and Karros walked before Vizcaino struck out.
</P>
<P>
   In being obliterated by the Padres, the Dodgers scored four runs
in 27 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The perils of the offense are reciprocated, in a small-picture
way, by what's turning into strong pitching, at least for the last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers right-hander Darren Dreifort took the advise of former
Dodgers pitcher Doug Bochtler and trainer Stan Johnston during a
recent bullpen session and ran with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bochtler watched me throw and said, `That was the quietest
I've seen your head,' '' Dreifort said. ``Stan, he said the biggest
thing was getting strike one. You know it, but sometimes you forget
it. Sometimes it's trying to do too much stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Too much stuff? It sounds familiar. It's been the refrain coming
out of the Dodgers' clubhouse for the past month or so.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (6-6) simplified things. He forgot about having the
perfect leg kick and didn't think about arm angles in the middle of
his delivery.
</P>
<P>
   It worked for 62/3 innings during an 8-1 win against
Philadelphia, Dreifort's first start since his near-banishment to
the bullpen, a decision by Dodgers manager Davey Johnson that
lasted for a day. The mere threat of Dreifort returning to the
bullpen, where he began his Dodgers career, might be enough to turn
him around.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time he pitched into the seventh inning in
back-to-back starts. Dreifort allowed two runs on five hits in
seven innings, but given the way the Dodgers have played, that
wasn't going to be enough. The Padres took a 1-0 lead in the first
on Dave Magadan's sacrifice fly and made it 2-0 in the third on
another Magadan sacrifice fly.

FOES FEEL FORCE CAN BE BEATEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is there a dent in John Force's championship armor?
</P>
<P>
   Some of his competitors think so.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-time National Hot Rod Association Funny Car champion
won six of the first eight national events, but he's failed to
visit victory circle in the past two races.
</P>
<P>
   Now drivers in the nitromethane-coupe class believe they have a
small amount of hope, especially at this weekend's Sears Craftsman
Nationals near St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Force can be beat,'' said Frank Pedregon, the defending event
champion. ``Both of those guys (including Force teammate Tony
Pedregon) can be beat. Tony (has) the quickest car in the world,
but we beat him at (the Gatornationals). I raced Force a couple
times, and we almost had him (at Englishtown, N.J.).
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely can be beat and I think right now (the rest of
the competitors in Funny Car) should all start jumping in there and
try to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Pedregon may have the best chance at that this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the older of the Pedregon brothers the defending
event champion, but his Pontiac Firebird is tuned by the crafty Jim
Dunn, who traditionally finds ways to get down a hot, slippery
track like St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is, but I always seem to do better in the
last half of the season,'' Pedregon said. ``Right now, we're ready
to shine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think the last four races we started to come on. The
first part, we were just feeling it out, not do anything crazy.
Now, going into St. Louis we feel we can back up our win from last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's event will feature the NHRA's first night race
since 1996. Qualifying, which began Thursday, included two 9 p.m.
(local time) sessions with eliminations slated to begin at 4 p.m.
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans are going to love this race,'' Pro Stock driver
Richie Stevens said. ``It won't make much difference for us in Pro
Stock, but for the (Top Fuel and Funny Cars) is going to be great.
When those race cars are shooting flames up into the darkness, it's
awesome to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The night air should also benefit Force, who had one of the best
weekends of his career at the last night event. Not only did he win
the 1996 Western Auto Nationals in Topeka, Kan., but he became the
first Funny Car driver to make eight consecutive passes in the
four-second barrier.
</P>
<P>
   You can call Kenny Bernstein the Bud King for a few more years.
</P>
<P>
   The five-time champion announced earlier this week that
Budweiser will continue to be his primary sponsor through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to have had the opportunity to represent Budweiser
and I'm happy we've had so many successes together,'' said
Bernstein, winner of 52 national events in a career that dates back
to the early 1970s. ``My 20 years with Budweiser have been
phenomenal and I'm looking forward to our future together.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein, who currently is third in the Top Fuel points
standings, is the only competitor in NHRA to win both a Top Fuel
title and a Funny Car championship.
</P>
<P>
   He won four consecutive Funny Car titles in the early 1980s
before capturing the Top Fuel championship in 1996. Bernstein is
also the first driver to eclipse the 300-mph barrier, accomplishing
that milestone in 1992.

REAL QUIET EYES $3 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Trainer Bob Baffert remembers a time when
Real Quiet looked more like a tropical fish than a race horse.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Mike Pegram expected to pay $30,000 for the bay colt in
1996 and expressed surprise when he found out that Baffert was able
to get him for $17,000.
</P>
<P>
   He asked Baffert, ``What's he got? Cancer?''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert remembers telling him not to worry. The yearling looked
great, perhaps perfect from the side, even if the front perspective
was so funky it brought the price down.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the front he looked really narrow, you know how it is
with a tropical fish?,'' Baffert asked. ``They can look real nice
from the side but when they swim away they're real skinny like
nothing's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, ``He was just real narrow from the front,'' Baffert
recalled. ``So I called him `Fish.'''
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, the little guy filled out and began to look like
a race horse. Then last year, any doubts about his abilities were
erased when Real Quiet came within a nose of the Triple Crown and
established himself as one of the premier race horses in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday Real Quiet and three other horses will compete in the
$1 million Grade I Hollywood Gold Cup. A win would boost the colt's
career earnings to well over the $3 million mark and put the
$17,000 horse in some pretty elite company.
</P>
<P>
   The past year has been a little more rough though.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the Belmont by a nose to Victory Gallop, Real Quiet
took some time off. He came back in March and finished second in
the Grade III New Orleans Handicap. In April he finished second in
the Grade III Texas Mile.
</P>
<P>
   In early May he seemed to have his racing legs back and
outdueled Free House down the stretch for a win in the Grade I
Pimlico Special Handicap. But three weeks later Real Quiet weakened
in the stretch and finished third in the Grade II Massachusetts
Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   It was his worst finish since a dull effort in the Jan. 1998
Golden Gate Derby earned Real Quiet an eighth-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, Hollywood Park Thursday installed Real Quiet as
the 7-5 morning-line favorite in the Gold Cup. But, that favorite
status was conferred largely by default after Old Trieste was
stricken by a fever earlier in the week and subsequently withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side Real Quiet's works this year have been
impressive -- just about all bullets. In the most recent, on
Tuesday, he was clocked at a sizzling :581/5 over five furlongs.
That day the bullet went to stablemate General Challenge, preparing
for Saturday's Affirmed Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert is confident about Real Quiet's chances on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ready,'' Baffert said. ``He's worked like he's supposed
to work.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the 1999 campaign, Baffert isn't making too many excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he shows up he can win it,'' Baffert said. ``He doesn't
have a lot of wins because of his style. But here -- in this field
-- if he gets into that long lope he can pour it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Gary Stevens -- Real Quiet's regular rider -- has left
for England, Jerry Bailey will get the mount Sunday. Other horses
entered include Malek and Puerto Madero, both trained by Richard
Mandella; and Budroyale, trained by Ted West Jr.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, Sunday's race should be competitive, Baffert
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's going to run away with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet's appearance in the Gold Cup marks the first time
since 1990 that a Kentucky Derby winner has competed in the event
when Sunday Silence finished second to Criminal Type.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to have a Derby winner in this is a big deal,'' Baffert
said. ``It's like one of those deals where you just know you can do
well.''

GORE PLUGS AWAY, INTO THE NIGHT, TO CAPTURE HEART OF CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  ABOARD AIR FORCE II _ Vice President Al Gore is leaning
backwards in a big, oversized leather seat in his private office on
board, phone glued to his ear.
<P>
   He's just raced 800 miles up and down California _ fund raising,
speeches, interviews, more fund raising, more speeches. But the
day's not over. He is on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   While his young staff chows down on a late-night snack of
buffalo wings, Gore is still working, working to become the next
president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gore knows California is a big place, but it's crowded these
days with presidential candidates vying for attention. Texas Gov.
George W. Bush arrives next week, and will be followed by a horde
of 80 reporters.
</P>
<P>
   With only a handful of media types following him this week, Gore
is already being described as the tortoise chasing the proverbial
hare.
</P>
<P>
   But with nine months to go before the California primary and the
candidate himself admitting that voters still aren't focused on the
race, Gore's campaign message in the nation's most populous state
has begun to emerge. And with it has come a steely focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to keep the prosperity going _ with my own values of
faith and family,'' he said again and again during his two-day trip
this week.
</P>
<P>
   He seized on gun control and hit the GOP hard (``The NRA is
calling the shots in the Republican Party today''). He talked of
revolutionary changes in education. And, though the economic boom
has been formidable, he said the task is now ``to reach out to
every member of our society, to make sure no one is left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how unwaveringly the vice president adheres to his message
was illustrated in San Francisco, where Gore was interviewed by a
quartet of television reporters within 45 minutes on Wednesday.
Their questions varied widely _ the polls, Bush, gay rights, his
fund raising _ but each time, the vice president skillfully stuck
to his message.
</P>
<P>
   This election is a choice between risky tax schemes or focused
tax cuts, he argued. Will Americans want to protect gun
manufacturers, he asked, or ``should we shield the children'' from
gun violence instead?
</P>
<P>
   Will they want to invest in public schools or drain money away
in the form of voucher schemes? Is it going to be about privatizing
Social Security or preserving and protecting Social Security?
</P>
<P>
   Gore also faced up to those who would tie him to his boss,
saying, ``It is time for a clean start in a fresh century.``
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles Thursday, he started out with lunch, ended with a
fund-raising dinner and tucked between them a visit to a gay and
lesbian center.
</P>
<P>
   There, as in San Francisco, Gore appealed to more traditional
Democrats by talking about standing for those who are misperceived
and misunderstood, and for families ``of all kinds.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has begun to do what those who know him say is most
critical: telling voters who he is and why he wants the job.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president of the United States begins his talks to
supporters like a guy on a job interview. He tells crowds where he
grew up (``in two places''), that he's a Vietnam vet, about his
family and marriage to wife Tipper for 29 years, his stint as a
reporter. And even how he's going to be a grandparent in a few
days, and start spoiling the grandkid.
</P>
<P>
   So, Gore insiders say, let George W. Bush come to California.
</P>
<P>
   The hare is dashing in next week, they say, but the tortoise has
been here 57 times.
</P>
<P>
   He'll keep going, slow and steady, making phone calls until well
into the night.
</P>

PADRES BEAT DODGERS TO CAP SWEEP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 Daily News Staff Writer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The body language shows the toll that losing is
taking. The jump in the Los Angeles Dodgers' step is gone, and
every time they hit the ground, they take more and more time to
pull their bodies up again.
</P>
<P>
   They said it couldn't get worse than the throwing and fielding
mishaps two weeks ago in Oakland, or worse than Kevin Brown
forgetting the number of outs.
</P>
<P>
   The follies are fewer, but the results remain consistent. The
Dodgers aren't getting worse (because they couldn't), but they're
certainly getting no better.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers hoped to turn things around on their longest
homestand. Instead, San Diego completed a three-game sweep with a
2-1 win Thursday at Dodger Stadium. The Dodgers went 3-6 on the
homestand. The Dodgers (32-38) and San Diego Padres (31-38) are
tied for last in the National League West in the loss column and by
the end of today, the $80 million underachieving Boys in Blue might
be dead last in the division.
</P>
<P>
   Since firing pitching coach Charlie Hough to shake up the
then-.500 Dodgers, they are 10-16.
</P>
<P>
   In being obliterated by the Padres, the Dodgers scored four runs
in three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things were like this on other teams I've been on, they
wouldn't fire coaches, they would get rid of players,'' said left
fielder Gary Sheffield, who at .306 is the only regular hitting
better than .300. But where the Dodgers stand doesn't matter. If
the Dodgers were in second place, it wouldn't matter right now, not
with the way they're playing. This isn't about where they stand
with other teams but rather where they rate themselves.
</P>
<P>
   What is noticeable, to Sheffield, is teams seem to play harder
against the Dodgers. And there's a reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you make comments about winning the World Series, teams
are going to come after you,'' said Sheffield, who bucked the trend
and hit .400 on the homestand. ``We're not playing with any
enthusiasm. We're going out there and thinking they should hand it
to us. It's embarrassing to me. I don't know about everyone else.
I'm tired of it. I hope everybody else is.''
</P>
<P>
   Every day the Dodgers talk about turning it around, and then
nothing happens.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours off the disabled list, Padres right-hander Andy Ashby
(7-4) retired the first 11 Dodgers he faced and allowed four hits
in six-plus innings. Sheffield broke up any early thoughts of
history with a single to left in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers didn't get a runner to second base until the sixth,
and an inning later the enigma that is the Dodgers' offensive
offense was in full bloom. Sheffield walked, Raul Mondesi singled
and Todd Hollandsworth singled to pull the Dodgers within 2-1.
Donne Wall relieved Ashby, and Eric Karros, Jose Vizcaino Devon
White each failed to hit the ball out of the infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be able to drive that run in,'' Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said. ``I hate to be thinking about squeezing in the
tying run, but that's what's going through my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Padres right-hander Dan Miceli pitched the ninth for his first
save, though it was somewhat eventful. Hollandsworth singled with
two outs and Karros walked before Vizcaino struck out looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a ball, outside,'' Vizcaino said. ``I saw it three
times. It was outside. There's nothing going our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Darren Dreifort (6-6) took the loss because the
Padres were able to hit a fly ball. Dave Magadan drove in runs in
the first and third innings with sacrifice flies. The first run
scored despite Magadan's ball being the only one hit out of the
infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no answer,'' Karros said of the Dodgers' doldrums.
``If there were answers, I'm sure it would be addressed.''

 SCIENTISTS HELP SEA HORSES BACK FROM NEAR EXTINCTION  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The curious and quirky little sea horse, a
monster in mythic lore, faces extinction throughout the world's
oceans _ but a young biologist at the California Academy of
Sciences is using his experimental skills in an attempt to reverse
the widespread death toll.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Gomezjurado, 32, whose passion for sea horses began when
he watched them vanishing because of the illegal nets of fishermen
around the fabled Galapagos Islands, is now breeding them by the
thousands in his laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Among all the denizens of the ocean, sea horses and their
relatives, the pipefishes, are the only species in the world whose
males get pregnant and give birth to the babies. Their entire sex
life is odd indeed.
</P>
<P>
   In Gomezjurado's laboratory tank the other day, where sea horses
by the score swam blithely amid tiny forests of kelp and coral, he
pointed to one lively specimen wearing a delicate identifying
plastic tag around its neck and a belly that was obviously bulging.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's No. 40,'' the biologist said, ``and he's very, very
pregnant _ he'll give birth to the babies within a day or two, and
an hour later he'll be ready to mate all over again. He's
incredible. He never stops, and he's always pregnant. Monogamous?
Not at all. He'll mate again with the first female that comes
along.''
</P>
<P>
   Sea Horse No. 40, in fact, did give birth to about 700 tiny,
free-swimming infants over the weekend, and he is ready to get
pregnant again _ the champion of the tank.
</P>
<P>
   A male's courtship ritual is lovely to behold. He changes his
mottled body color from mostly green or brown to a more attractive
golden hue, and his fins darken.
</P>
<P>
   Then, swimming vertically face to face with a willing female,
the couple swim into a slow dance through wide circles and rise
together toward the surface as they copulate. In that act, repeated
several times, the male opens the brood pouch on his belly and the
female deposits her eggs into the pouch, where the male can quickly
fertilize them.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, the babies emerge from the pregnant male by the
hundreds to live their endangered lives completely on their own _
if they are not swiftly consumed by predatory fishes.
</P>
<P>
   Extremely delicate and harvested commercially by the millions,
dried sea horses are ground up for folk medicines that are sold in
Asian markets as cures for everything from impotence to heart
disease. And although they rarely survive long in home aquariums,
many hobbyists buy them and try to keep them alive, although they
are now on the World Conservation Union's ``red list'' as a
threatened population.
</P>
<P>
   At the academy's Steinhart Aquarium in Golden Gate Park, six
small tanks hold four species of sea horses from Gomezjurado's
laboratory on permanent public display.
</P>
<P>
   He will move sea horse No. 40 from the lab into one of the
display tanks this week so the virile champion can mate with a
female again and produce another few hundred babies in another two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Fisheries scientists at 35 institutions around the world are
joining in an attempt to replenish stocks of the 32 species of sea
horses that inhabit every warm-water ocean, according to
Gomezjurado.
</P>
<P>
   The young Ecuadoran biologist specializes in the world's largest
species of sea horses, the giant one called Hippocampus ingens that
grows up to a foot long and inhabits Pacific waters from central
Baja California to the Galapagos islands and northern Peru.
</P>
<P>
   In the open seas, the survival rate among newborn sea horses is
only about 1 percent. In the past, even under the best of
laboratory conditions, scientists have been able to keep only about
5 percent of their newborns alive.
</P>
<P>
   But by experimenting with varied diets, Gomezjurado said, at
least 30 percent of the newborn sea horses in his lab are thriving.
</P>
<P>
   Tall, green tanks in the lab hold thick cultures of saltwater
algae, the phytoplankton that forms the base of the intricate food
chain on which all oceangoing life depends. Microscopic animals
called rotifers feed on the algae, and nauplii, the free-swimming
larvae of larger but still tiny crustaceans, live on the rotifers.
Next on the food chain, devouring the lower orders, come the larger
crustaceans called copepods, and they provide nourishment in turn
for shrimp and other larger animals.
</P>
<P>
   Gomezjurado has created a similar food chain in his laboratory,
and nourishes his hundreds of sea horses with a pulverized pink mix
of frozen organisms and mysid shrimp, supplemented by drugstore
multivitamins and the same omega-3 fatty acids that humans consume
to help prevent heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   With their strange, equine heads, bony outer skeletons and
curving, prehensile tails, sea horses have long intrigued humans.
Their generic name _ hippocampus _ comes from the Greek hippos,
meaning horse, and kampos, meaning monster. In ancient Greece, the
myths held that the creatures were true monsters, born of Poseidon,
the sea god, and that they menaced humans with their two forefeet
and their bodies ending in a dolphin's tail.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Gomezjurado's sea horses are no monsters, but a
priceless part of the ocean's diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our captive breeding project will reduce pressures on the wild
population by replenishing aquarium displays, and the data from our
research may someday be useful in reestablishing wild populations,
too,'' he said.

ONLY SAFE PLACE IS BEHIND BARS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Honk if you're on the lam.
</P>
<P>
   Truly frightening, The Chronicle series about mountains of
unserved arrest warrants. I won't feel safe until I'm locked up in
San Quentin, where the violent criminals are at least supervised.
</P>
<P>
   Our courts should mail out those warrants with RSVPs.
</P>
<P>
   Now the authorities say they'll spring into action and start
rounding up some of the more annoying fugitive ax murderers. Why
are the authorities never aware of these problems until they read
about 'em in The Chronicle?
</P>
<P>
   Now the jails will become overcrowded. Possible solution: Chain
gangs. Massachussetts has them now, though they call them ``tandem
work crews.'' The man in charge says, ``My program ... builds
self-esteem and self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   So we round up the bad guys and gals, slap chains on 'em, and we
get our highways and cities cleaned up while the prisoners get a
new self-image. I picture them working alongside the freeway
singing tandem work crew songs like ``Just the Two of Us`' and ``Me
and You and a Dog Named Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   But why should convicts get all the self-esteem? What about us
cutting-edge self-improvement freaks? I'm chaining myself to Jon
Carroll, and I think you'll be noticing better work from both of
us.
</P>
<P>
   THE DICTIONARY isn't big enough for Willie Brown. Heather
Peterson was watching KTVU News, and da mayor was discussing a
run-down building.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must have been thinking decrepit and dilapidated at the
same time,'' says Heather, ``and it came out `decrapitated.' Then
he paused for a second _ must have been thinking, `Close enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   Good word, sure to have many handy uses in da mayor's city.
</P>
<P>
   DE NEW de Young Museum, judging from general response of
armchair architects, is already decrapitated. Does anybody like the
design?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the artist's rendering is a bad picture. As a daily victim
of that malady, I can sympathize. But the Golden Gate Bridge or
Palace of Fine Arts, this building ain't. It looks like a Howard
Johnson's of the future.
</P>
<P>
   A STEAL: Wow, Jennie Yabroff brings to our attention an ad in
Friday's Chronicle for a big on-campus sale at S.F. State. They're
selling ``new and used pianos on loan to the university.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Jennie, ``Now we know why Polonius told Laertes, `Neither a
borrower nor a lender be.'''
</P>
<P>
   And there's your culture for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the piano sale will fund the university's new
advertisement-proofreading chair.
</P>
<P>
   DING-DING, ZZZZ: It's late in the evening and we're at the Hyde
Street cable car turntable. A long line of tourists shiver in the
cold and fog. Half a block away, a long line of cable cars (often
four and five) wait and wait.
</P>
<P>
   What are the car crews doing while the tourists cool their heels
and freeze their assets? Some are dozing. I've seen 'em.
</P>
<P>
   Muni tells me the cable cars actually have schedules, and the
gripman and conductor are allowed a break between runs. But not the
30 and 40 minutes and more they often take at Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   It's costing the city. Tourists don't spend dough while they're
waiting 90 minutes for a cable car.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, it's rude. Let's get those car crews some fresh coffee
and an on-site dispatcher to provide wake-up calls.
</P>
<P>
   ARRIVEDERCI: Fuzio's restaurant in North Beach, the franchise
eatery that bullied its way in over strong local objection, has
gone quietly into that great good night (hey, another pretentious
literary reference!).
</P>
<P>
   The locals have an ongoing crusade to keep the area free of
chain restaurants and stores, but Fuzio's, owned by Chevy's,
sneaked in with a back-door play. Six months later, it was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Beach spoke with its feet,'' says Aaron Peskin,
president of the Telegraph Hill Dwellers. ``The presumption was
that we have to fight the chains because if they come in, they'll
succeed. Now they know they'll have to fight to get in, then people
won't eat there.''
</P>
<P>
   Three other Fuzio's in the city hum along, but score a win for
the spirit of North Beach.
</P>
<P>
   YOU ARE the wings beneath my ice cube: Tom Sweeney, Beefeater
doorman at the Sir Francis Drake, is training for the Boston
Marathon, and he finished a run at Ocean Beach. Heading home, he
came upon a sidewalk lemonade stand on Fulton Street.
</P>
<P>
   Tom gave the kid two quarters. The kid gave Tom a lemonade and a
quarter back.
</P>
<P>
   Tom: ``The sign says 50 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   Kid: ``Yours had a fly in it.''
</P>
<P>
   OUCH: Betsy Bogel sends a clip from the Independent in San
Mateo, a brief report of a car accident in which ``One victim
sustained a two-inch evisceration in his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Coulda been worse. The guy coulda been decrapitated.

CELLULAR ONE PLANS TO CHARGE FOR UNANSWERED CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cellular One already charges cell phone customers when they make
a call or take a call. Now it wants to make sure it charges them
even when no one answers the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Starting July 1, Cellular One plans to start imposing charges
for 15 seconds (the equivalent of about three rings) after the
customer hits the send button on a call. The charges would apply
even if no connection is made.
</P>
<P>
   Because Cellular One bills in one-minute increments, the new
policy means calls that ring more than 15 seconds will carry at
least a one-minute charge, or anywhere from 10 to 52 cents
depending on the customer's calling plan. If the customer has free
calling minutes, minutes will start being deducted after 15
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular One, a subsidiary of SBC Communications of San Antonio,
issued a two-paragraph statement Thursday defending the new charge,
stating that its network is utilized whenever a call is made. By
allowing a grace period of just 15 seconds, the company said more
channels will remain open for use by other customers.
</P>
<P>
   The company declined to comment further, other than to say
customers have been notified of the change.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular One's grace period in the Massachusetts-Rhode
Island-New Hampshire market has been steadily cut over the past few
years from 60 seconds to 30 seconds and now to 15 seconds. SBC's
wireless operations in Connecticut and Washington, D.C., are not as
miserly, allowing a 30-second grace period. By contrast, officials
from most of SBC's wireless rivals said they charge customers only
if a connection is made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like they're picking on you guys,'' said K.C. Choi, a
spokesman for the Telecommunications Research and Action Center in
Washington, a consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   Choi said he did not think most consumers were aware of the
calling grace periods. He said he was not aware of them, and he had
just signed up with Cellular One in Washington. He also said 15
seconds seemed to be unreasonably short, given the length of time
it takes for some people to answer the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular One's policy appears to be unique in the industry. John
Palmer, executive director of marketing for Bell Atlantic Mobile,
said his company does not buy into its rival's reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers are demanding value and are not willing to
tolerate unnecessary or hidden charges that they wouldn't normally
expect to pay,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Nee, a spokesman for AT&AMP;T Wireless, had a similar
reaction. ``If no one picks up on the other end, no one gets
charged,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Omnipoint and officials at Sprint PCS also said
their companies do not start charge until a connection is made.

   The grace period issue is very different from a proposal that
would change the overall billing structure for cellular phone
calls. Currently, cell phone customers are charged for incoming and
outgoing calls, but federal regulators are moving toward a billing
system that would charge all calls to the person placing the call.

SHADOW BOXER: FORT WORTH FIGHTER READY TO STEP INTO SPOTLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Johnny Tapia's rap sheet is almost as detailed as
his line-by-line ring record. It is a combination that has made
``The Baby Face Assassin'' a three-time world champion and one of
the most compelling draws in boxing.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, the life and times of bantamweight contender
Paulie Ayala comes off as what? Boring?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's normal, man,'' said Ayala, the Fort Worth fighter who
will challenge Tapia for his World Boxing Association bantamweight
(118-pound) title at the Mandalay Bay Events Center here tomorrow
night. ``I knew the difference between right and wrong _ and I was
scared to do wrong. That's what I see myself as right now: Just a
normal guy who chose boxing for a career.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Tapia, the pride of Albuquerque, N.M., and blessed with
the blinding speed, the defense and the accuracy that separates
world contenders from world wannabes. But Tapia's rise to fame came
careening to a halt at the beginning of this decade, when his
addiction to cocaine led to a 3 1/2-year suspension from boxing.
With the help of his wife and manager, Teresa, Tapia has
resurrected himself, and reminded Ayala of what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala said that during his own ``party period,'' he rebelled
against the strict rules imposed upon him by his parents, Frank and
Gloria Ayala. Late in his promising Texas Golden Gloves amateur
career, Ayala burned out on boxing. He said he developed a fondness
for drinking beer. And whiskey. And he experimented with drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've used 'em. I sure have,'' said Ayala, 29. ``I mean,
at the post office, that's all there was, man, believe it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala said he worked for the post office in 1990-91 on the
letter-sorter machine. His lunch break typically was topped off by
a marijuana cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing it even before I got into the post office,'' Ayala
said. ``I experimented with drugs. But I never used intravenous
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala also said he never has taken cocaine. Just that
``recreational'' use of weed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all drugs are bad _ and beer and whiskey and cigarettes,''
Ayala said. ``A lot of the guys I hung out with are in prison, so I
could have been just like them. Easily, I could have been in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to party. I remember going to a high school
graduation party that turned sour, where some guys started
fighting. We hid. We were standing behind a car and sure enough _
pow-pow-pow _ you hear gunshots. Everybody runs, and there was a
kid lying in the street. And this kid that got killed was an
innocent bystander who had just gotten off work. I've witnessed
that. That was scary. I just wanted to have fun. That ain't my kind
of fun. So, see you later, man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, I had a good foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Scared straight, Ayala returned to amateur boxing in time to
make a run at the 1992 Olympic Trials. He did not qualify for the
team to Barcelona, Spain, that summer but the rush of national
competition rekindled Ayala's love affair with boxing. In February
1992, Ayala married Leticha ``Letty'' Barrera. That fall, he turned
to professional boxing to support himself and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Paulie came to us seven years ago, there was one thing I
told him. I'm sure he remembers,'' said Paul Reyes, head trainer at
the Boxing Management Inc. Gym in Fort Worth. ``And I hated to use
Stevie Cruz as an example.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, of Fort Worth, stunned the boxing world with an upset
15-round decision against unbeaten Irish hero Barry McGuigan to win
the WBA featherweight (126-pound) title on June 23, 1986, in Las
Vegas. Cruz celebrated long and hard and found it difficult to
return to his workout regimen. His reign unceremoniously was ended
nine months later, when ``Little Stevie'' was battered en route to
a 12th-round TKO defeat against Antonio Esparragoza in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stevie could have made a lot of money,'' Reyes said. ``He had
that Colgate smile. You couldn't help but like the kid. But he hung
around with the wrong people. That's what ruined him.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I said to Paulie, `I heard you've been partying. I don't
care how good you are. You're doing that, staying out late, you're
going to be wasting our time and your time.' Since then, I've never
heard of him drinking or anything. He's dedicated himself to his
training and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala said he has not had an alcoholic drink since September
1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I used drugs was way before that,'' said Ayala,
now fully settled and the father of a son, 7-year-old Paul II, and
daughter, Aleah, who was born seven weeks ago. ``That's why I'm
thankful to the Lord that I'm where I'm at. Basically, I had set my
goals when I turned pro, but we've been going through this by
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala's bid for his first world title ended in his only
professional loss, a sixth-round technical decision against
then-World Boxing Council bantamweight champion Joichiro Tatsuyoshi
in Japan on Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people said I wasn't going to get a title shot after
the Japanese fight,'' said Ayala (27-1, 12 KOs), the No. 2-ranked
WBA contender. ``I didn't believe that because, like I said, I'm
walking by faith. Not by sight. You don't know what God has in
store for you. You keep serving him and good things will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glorifying the Lord. He's blessed me and my family. I've
got perfect health, that's what I've asked for. And just for a
chance to be the champion. And look. I was just hoping to fight
``any'' champion. But bam! You're fighting for a world title. Bam!
You're fighting Johnny Tapia. I mean, everything is just falling
into place, just by staying diligent and working hard in the gym.
And by serving Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Tapia also has been born-again, which is why Ayala is
not quick to pass judgment on boxing's Prodigal Son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has skeletons in their closet,'' said Ayala, who
attends the nondenominational Teaching Word Faith Center in Fort
Worth. ``The thing about it, no matter what you've done, Jesus will
forgive you. That's why I don't judge people. Because I don't want
to be judged.'' nn

DON'T EXPLAIN GAMES, JUST X 'EM OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A fervent prayer is offered here that at some point in the next
century, as they dig through the rubble that was 1999, they don't
find our ``TV Guide'' listings.
</P>
<P>
   I think we're going to have a hard time explaining the X Games.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight-plus hours of skysurfing, dirt jumping and assorted
other Sports Your Mom Wouldn't Let You Do.
</P>
<P>
   I don't get it, but then again, I'm not supposed to. I've never
busted a 900, I wore my last pair of Army camouflage pants 27 years
ago, and I don't have a single CD by the Dropkick Murphys.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN X Games, nevertheless, turn 5 years old today with the same
drooling silliness of any other 5-year-old, and with a list of
big-time sponsors that would turn even Jerry Jones an envious
green.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, Disney, Sony, AT&AMP;T, Heineken, Visa and even that
loathsomely annoying Taco Bell chihuahua are among the X Games
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect any Cadillac or Rogaine commercials. The X Games
are a blatantly created-for-TV pseudo-event designed to fill
network time during one of the slowest periods of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Their target is primarily that richest of marketing demographics
_ young males. Beyond the corporate sponsors, the X Games are
fueled by dozens of bicycle companies, equipment manufacturers,
clothing corporations and even the host cities themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, people actually bid to host the X Games.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has the X-fest this year, which clearly proves
that effects from LSD can, indeed, linger into the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   As an ad for the X Games read, ``What better place to groove
than the land of Berserkely and North Beach, Acid tests and
six-hour jams, beat daddies and gone sisters ... Phone Tony
Bennett. Exhume Janis and Jerry ... because the city that put the
alt-dot in alternative will make X Games '99 the sweetest freak
show this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The X-fest features competition in nine sports categories, some
of which are bicycle stunt riding, in-line skating, skateboarding,
climbing and the always-popular street luge.
</P>
<P>
   In street luge, competitors strap themselves to what appears to
be a loose association of ball bearings, and hurl themselves down
mountain roads at 70 mph with their brain pans roughly one-half
inch above the asphalt. The event also has introduced to the
vocabulary the endearing expression ``puke a wheel,'' which happens
to the luge and luger when the speeding rollers melt from the
intense heat.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme sports are nothing new and certainly not the
brainchildren of any cable TV executive. Ultra-marathon running and
the triathlon are considered extreme sports. No one would dispute
the athletic abilities of a triathlete or a true mountain climber.
</P>
<P>
   But what, beyond a stainless steel diaper and some Forrest
Gump-level brain activity, does it take to be a skysurfer? (One of
the sport's top competitors died in a jump last year).
</P>
<P>
   And what about skateboarding? Cool by ESPN, but still outlawed
in malls and church parking lots across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The top snowboarders at the 1998 Winter Olympics all had their
beginnings in skateboarding, and we saw how bogus that turned out
in Nagano, didn't we? Busted tricks, tasty buds, and a good zinc
oxide don't necessarily make for good spectator sport.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, at the X-fest, skateboarding and snowboarding thrive.
Organizers make the snow themselves, last time creating a giant
hill of shaved ice right on the ocean beach in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   In that future archaeological dig, I predict that scientists
will unearth skateboarding half-pipes and assume that they were a
crude early attempt to fly. In truth, we can verify that they are
merely modern attempts to escape homework.
</P>
<P>
   An alarming aside: The city of Escondido, Calif., has spent $2
million to build a 20,000-square-foot skating park, replete with
ramps, bowls and half-pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Let me guess. Is the mayor's name Jeff Spicoli?
</P>
<P>
   X Gamers might argue that theirs is a legitimate sporting
attraction. Right. Even the network that created them knows better.
Hence, ESPN's practice of taping everything, adding music and
over-caffeinated commentating, and showing it all on a two-day
delayed basis.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, according to the network, the fifth X Games will reach an
estimated 76 million households in the United States and another
171 million worldwide on ESPN International. Fans can buy X Games
skateboards, helmets, sunglasses, boxer shorts, video games and the
apparently must-have CD soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   I'll pass, thank you. But if they do exhume Janis and Jerry,
tell them not to puke a wheel in the street luge.

 &HT;    JUSTICE SYSTEM SLOGS ON TOWARD AN EVENTUAL TRIAL FOR CISNEROS
 &HT;    For release Sunday, June 27.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin rocked back in
his loudly creaking chair, chewed on ice from his ever-present
plastic cup and fretted over how to find a jury in the coming trial
of former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G.
Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a pool of 300 people, you want to send out 2,500
notices?'' the judge asked incredulously last week, after the jury
clerk informed him that 90 percent of recipients either aren't
eligible to serve on a jury or don't bother to respond to a
summons.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin has already delayed the trial's start until after Labor
Day after concluding that the search for jurors would be hopeless
during the summer, when Washingtonians are vacationing. Last week,
he suggested that federal marshals might be sent to the homes of
slackers.
</P>
<P>
   Seating a jury is just one more test for the judicial system as
it tackles the latest capital scandal to take center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for a speedy trial were abandoned long ago for Cisneros,
who was indicted in December 1997 on 18 counts of lying to the FBI
about paying roughly $250,000 to buy the silence of his ex-mistress
Linda Jones, then known by her married name of Medlar.
</P>
<P>
   The government charges that Cisneros had admitted to only about
$60,000 in payments when undergoing security checks before Clinton
appointed him to his cabinet. Cisneros has pleaded not guilty to
the charges.
</P>
<P>
   At a pretrial hearing last week, Sporkin looked out at more than
a dozen attorneys, including some of Washington's leading defense
lawyers and the prosecuting team of independent counsel David
Barrett, and despaired that a ``blizzard of motions'' threatened
even more delays.
</P>
<P>
   Costs of the prosecution have already soared, with the
independent counsel's spending already at $8.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't count the $500-an-hour billings from defense
lawyers led by Brendan V. Sullivan Jr.. Sullivan first tried to
have the case dismissed by arguing that courts have no right to
judge whether a presidential appointee tells the truth on
background forms. The pleading was rejected by an appeals court,
but not before delaying the trial for months.
</P>
<P>
   This focus in court last week was whether the prosecutors will
be able to use up to 34 tapes of Cisneros, secretly recorded by
Jones, discussing the payments to her and how to conceal them. The
defense teams wants the tapes to be excluded because Jones altered
the recordings, copying them and removing parts that might be
damaging to her. The judge is expected to rule soon on whether to
allow the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens on the tapes, the early skirmish makes
clear that the person most visibly on the hot seat at the Cisneros
trial will be Jones, his political fund-raiser when he was mayor of
San Antonio, who agreed in a plea bargain to testify against her
ex-lover.
</P>
<P>
   Now serving a 3 1/2-year sentence for bank fraud in a related
case, she told the saga of her downward spiral of divorce, mental
problems, financial ruin, and finally imprisonment for financing a
home in Lubbock, Texas, in the name of family members.
</P>
<P>
   Under unrelenting questioning from Sullivan about whether she
lied to the FBI, the IRS and to lawyers in a civil case, the
50-year-old Jones admitted again and again, ``Yes, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, who did not appear at the preliminary hearing, has
reconciled with his wife and is now chief executive officer of the
Spanish-language television network Univision, based in Los
Angeles.

 &HT;    Self-made plan can work for wood
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I have an e-mail query from a man who wants a
``pattern'' for a workbench with two drawers.
</P>
<P>
   While it is true, I believe, that some outfits do publish
patterns for woodworking projects, it has always seemed to me that
patterns are intended for tailors, and not for woodworkers. Our
material cannot be cut with scissors.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, our projects deal primarily with rectangles
and squares, things that are easily measured. As a result, plans
are more feasible than patterns.
</P>
<P>
   This leads nicely into my more or less standard rant about
plans, which examination of the archives indicates I have not
delivered recently.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'll begin this one with a disclaimer: There is nothing
intrinsically evil or corrupting about commercially produced
woodworking plans. They can be helpful. But no woodworker, not even
an amateur, should be fearful of embarking on a project without
having a set of commercial plans in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   When I receive queries about where a reader can find a plan for
this or a plan for that, I always assume, perhaps wrongly, that the
question comes from someone who really hasn't a clue about working
wood. They are assuming, in my imagination at least, that one
always begins a woodworking project with a set of plans.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that woodworkers often begin their projects with
plans, but they are plans that the woodworkers have drawn up
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need to be an artist or a master craftsman to make
your own plans. All you need is an understanding of wood and how
pieces of it are joined together to make furniture. This is not
rocket science. There are, admittedly, a great many ways to join
wood, but most of them are variations on a few standard techniques,
each of which is limited to a particular set of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Let's explore this theory.
</P>
<P>
   A workbench is basically a table, is it not? It is constructed
in the same way you would build a coffee table, except for size and
allowance for necessary strength. Both of these articles are going
to have four legs, a top, and some means of holding the legs in
position and keeping the top on top of them. This sub-assembly, the
legs and the pieces that hold them together, could be called the
frame.
</P>
<P>
   Since the frame of a workbench will be subject to stresses
undreamt of by a coffee table, it would be prudent to add some more
members to strengthen it.
</P>
<P>
   Very well, let's look at some tables. Doubtless there are some
within view right now. Most of them will have good-size pieces of
wood running between the legs, right under the top. These perform
not only the task of keeping the legs where they belong, but give
the top something to rest upon.
</P>
<P>
   For the greater strength required by a workbench, it would be a
good idea to repeat this connecting framework farther down the
legs, a foot or so off the floor. No doubt you've seen tables
constructed this way.
</P>
<P>
   The ways in which the legs and the connecting pieces can be
connected are dictated by a basic trait of wood: It moves. It moves
with the seasons, swelling with the wet summer and shrinking in the
dry winter. It swells and shrinks across the grain. If you look at
your nearby table, you will see that the grain on the legs is
running vertically and the grain on the connecting members runs
horizontally.
</P>
<P>
   This is a cross-grain connection, and it must be dealt with
accordingly, or the construction will fail.
</P>
<P>
   I can hear you now _ ``Hey, buddy, I just wanna build a
workbench. I don't need no stinkin' theory.'' In that case, you've
come to the wrong place _ Hammers, 10-Penny Nails and Basic Oaths
are two doors down. The rest of you, come back next week, same
time, same place.

 &HT;    What to do when you have to say `I don't'
 &HT;    By Michele Chan Santos
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He didn't see it coming.
</P>
<P>
   Mark and his fiancee dated for 4 1/2 years and had been engaged
for 1 1/2 years. They finished each other's sentences and were so
affectionate that strangers would come up to them in restaurants
and say, ``You two look so in love.''
</P>
<P>
   The wedding was going to be huge, a fairy-tale extravaganza with
more than 300 guests. Her dress was ready; the caterer, band,
photographer and florist were all hired. The cake was ordered, and
he had tickets for their honeymoon in hand, a cruise to St. Thomas,
Jamaica and Mexico. The invitations had been addressed by a
calligrapher and were ready to mail.
</P>
<P>
   They were eight weeks away from the day of the ceremony when she
called it off.
</P>
<P>
   It happened last summer, but Mark is still hurting. He was 26
then, and she was 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can compare it to a death,'' he says, ``but it's worse
because the person chooses not to be in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   It's high season for weddings this month, and from now through
October, hundreds of couples will be making vows, clinking
champagne glasses, cutting cake and dancing.
</P>
<P>
   But some people's weddings never make it to ``I do.'' The bride
or groom, or both, see their small doubts mushrooming into larger
ones, until suddenly they realize they can't go through with it.
Everyone seems to know a story of a wedding that didn't happen.
It's enough of a trend that a new movie, ``Runaway Bride,'' slated
for release July 30, stars Julia Roberts as a bride who leaves
three grooms at the altar. Richard Gere plays a reporter who wants
to write a story about her and ends up falling in love.
</P>
<P>
   Although the movie has a happy ending, most real-life canceled
weddings are messy: Bruised feelings, public humiliation and dashed
expectations quickly end a relationship that probably wasn't meant
to be.
</P>
<P>
   Mark's girlfriend called off their wedding because she felt she
lost her independence when she was with him, she says. The couple
had gone to college together in Austin, and after graduation she
decided she wanted to move to Louisiana. Four months before their
wedding, she moved. The plan was that he would stay in Austin and
live with his parents to save money; after their wedding, he would
join her.
</P>
<P>
   After she left, she made some discoveries. She liked being
independent, making new friends, living on her own. She wanted to
explore her new identity, and it didn't include being married to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Mark says he has finally come to terms with her decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't know who she was or what she wanted,'' he says.
``Even though we thought we were prepared, we weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk with men or women whose weddings were called off at the
last minute, and one theme emerges: Horrifying as it is to call off
a big event, it's not nearly as terrible as a bad marriage. Though
it may be expensive and painful to end things, it's usually the
right decision. Still, it's embarrassing enough that those
interviewed for this story didn't want their names used.
</P>
<P>
   Big doubts
</P>
<P>
   It was more than 10 years ago, but Robert hasn't forgotten how
much hurt he caused.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since his engagement, he had been plagued with doubts about
his relationship with his fiancee. The wedding-planning process had
smothered him, and he was scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to think clearly when all this stuff is going on,''
he says. The dress, the cake, the ceremony, the music _ it was all
overwhelming. ``From the first moment, it was nothing but
preparation. The couple _ us _ got swallowed up into this raging
F-5 tornado of preparation. It was very distressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a week before the wedding day, he called it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't act very courageously,'' he says. ``I should
have acted much earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   His girlfriend was devastated, her family deeply hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Robert says he and his fiancee didn't know one
another well enough. He doesn't regret his decision, just its
timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept waiting for myself to get comfortable,'' he says. ``I
thought all of my reservations would disappear. They didn't.'' They
had not known each other very long, he says, and he didn't think
they knew each other well enough to be married.
</P>
<P>
   The woman's parents did the damage control, returning the gifts,
sending out announcements.
</P>
<P>
   He advises engaged couples not to dismiss their doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not think that they are going to go away, especially if you
don't talk about them. It really is better to back out or air those
serious doubts,'' he says. ``Start dissecting it, figure out what's
at the root of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk it through early
</P>
<P>
   Diana Latham, director of Advanced Counseling Service in Austin,
has been conducting premarital counseling sessions with couples for
25 years. She suggests that engaged couples take advantage of
premarital sessions soon after their engagement _ and before
beginning any of the major planning for a large-scale wedding. Many
religious institutions offer premarital counseling, and some
require it.
</P>
<P>
   Couples who opt for a more secular route can consult a
therapist. Latham says that if you work for a company with an
employee assistance program, it may cover the fee for premarital
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   The age of each partner isn't necessarily a predictor of
happiness _ as many younger couples as older couples have
successful marriages _ but how long they have known one another
does matter, Latham says. The longer they have known each other,
the better, and it's also healthier if both of them have lived away
from their parents for a while. One couple Latham knows found their
marriage breaking apart when the woman was constantly leaving town
to visit her parents.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, a couple goes through counseling smoothly, only to
find they need it again later. Mark and his fiancee went through
counseling ``with flying colors,'' he says, but still didn't marry.
</P>
<P>
   If you do find yourself having serious doubts right before the
wedding, make an appointment with a therapist as soon as possible,
Latham says.
</P>
<P>
   It's useful to have a third party to hear your worries, and you
need to pay attention to your concerns, and not dismiss them as
``cold feet,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Making the best of a bad situation
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a canceled wedding can still lead to fond memories.
</P>
<P>
   Amy was barely 21 when she was supposed to get married. She and
her fiance had planned a trip to Las Vegas with her parents,
sister, and her two best friends. They purchased the nonrefundable
tickets and reserved hotel rooms. Everyone took time off from work
or school to go, and they were all set to make the trip, planning
to hold the wedding in a Vegas chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Except Amy wasn't ready. ``I knew I didn't want to do it,'' she
says now, ``but I was afraid to call it off. We got really great
prices on the tickets, and I didn't want to say anything. I almost
went through with it because I was too afraid. I thought my parents
were going to kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than three weeks before the trip, she got up the nerve to
tell her fiance, and her family, that she didn't want to get
married.
</P>
<P>
   Although her fiance was upset, her family and friends took the
news well. In fact, Amy, her parents, her sister and her friends
went ahead with the trip to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a fabulous time,'' Amy says. ``It was all pretty
wild.''
</P>
<P>
   She still has the dress, and she isn't married. She doesn't have
any regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scariest thing was just getting up the courage to say, 'I
don't want to do it,' `` she says. ``Anybody that has second
thoughts, if they are serious, they should back out.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions engaged couples should ask themselves:
</P>
<P>
   What are our values?
</P>
<P>
   Why are we getting married?
</P>
<P>
   Do we have compatible goals? Where do we want to be in 10 years?
</P>
<P>
   Have we discussed our finances? Do we agree on spending habits?
On a system for money management? Is one of us entering the
marriage in debt? How will we handle the debt?
</P>
<P>
   Where are we going to live?
</P>
<P>
   What does marriage mean to us?
</P>
<P>
   Do we want to have children?
</P>
<P>
   If we were not raised in the same faith, how will we handle
that? What religion will we raise our children in?
</P>
<P>
   Do my parents accept him? Do his parents accept me?
</P>
<P>
   Do we have something in common, a hobby, sport or interest, that
we enjoy in our spare time?
</P>
<P>
   Do we have friends in common?
</P>
<P>
   What ideas do we have about the roles of husbands and wives: Is
he going to expect me to do all the housework; do I expect him to
make more money?
</P>
<P>
   Are we both ready to make a commitment?
</P>

   Looking back, Robert says he and his fiancee didn't know one
another well enough. He doesn't regret his decision, just its
timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept waiting for myself to get comfortable,'' he says. ``I
thought all of my reservations would disappear. They didn't.'' They
had not known each other very long, he says, and he didn't think
they knew each other well enough to be married.
</P>
<P>
   The woman's parents did the damage control, returning the gifts,
sending out announcements.
</P>
<P>
   He advises engaged couples not to dismiss their doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not think that they are going to go away, especially if you
don't talk about them. It really is better to back out or air those
serious doubts,'' he says. ``Start dissecting it, figure out what's
at the root of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk it through early
</P>
<P>
   Diana Latham, director of Advanced Counseling Service in Austin,
has been conducting premarital counseling sessions with couples for
25 years. She suggests that engaged couples take advantage of
premarital sessions soon after their engagement _ and before
beginning any of the major planning for a large-scale wedding. Many
religious institutions offer premarital counseling, and some
require it.
</P>
<P>
   Couples who opt for a more secular route can consult a
therapist. Latham says that if you work for a company with an
employee assistance program, it may cover the fee for premarital
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   The age of each partner isn't necessarily a predictor of
happiness _ as many younger couples as older couples have
successful marriages _ but how long they have known one another
does matter, Latham says. The longer they have known each other,
the better, and it's also healthier if both of them have lived away
from their parents for a while. One couple Latham knows found their
marriage breaking apart when the woman was constantly leaving town
to visit her parents.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, a couple goes through counseling smoothly, only to
find they need it again later. Mark and his fiancee went through
counseling ``with flying colors,'' he says, but still didn't marry.
</P>
<P>
   If you do find yourself having serious doubts right before the
wedding, make an appointment with a therapist as soon as possible,
Latham says.
</P>
<P>
   It's useful to have a third party to hear your worries, and you
need to pay attention to your concerns, and not dismiss them as
``cold feet,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Making the best of a bad situation
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a canceled wedding can still lead to fond memories.
</P>
<P>
   Amy was barely 21 when she was supposed to get married. She and
her fiance had planned a trip to Las Vegas with her parents,
sister, and her two best friends. They purchased the nonrefundable
tickets and reserved hotel rooms. Everyone took time off from work
or school to go, and they were all set to make the trip, planning
to hold the wedding in a Vegas chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Except Amy wasn't ready. ``I knew I didn't want to do it,'' she
says now, ``but I was afraid to call it off. We got really great
prices on the tickets, and I didn't want to say anything. I almost
went through with it because I was too afraid. I thought my parents
were going to kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than three weeks before the trip, she got up the nerve to
tell her fiance, and her family, that she didn't want to get
married.
</P>
<P>
   Although her fiance was upset, her family and friends took the
news well. In fact, Amy, her parents, her sister and her friends
went ahead with the trip to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a fabulous time,'' Amy says. ``It was all pretty
wild.''
</P>
<P>
   She still has the dress, and she isn't married. She doesn't have
any regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scariest thing was just getting up the courage to say, 'I
don't want to do it,' `` she says. ``Anybody that has second
thoughts, if they are serious, they should back out.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions engaged couples should ask themselves:
</P>
<P>
   What are our values?
</P>
<P>
   Why are we getting married?
</P>
<P>
   Do we have compatible goals? Where do we want to be in 10 years?
</P>
<P>
   Have we discussed our finances? Do we agree on spending habits?
On a system for money management? Is one of us entering the
marriage in debt? How will we handle the debt?
</P>
<P>
   Where are we going to live?
</P>
<P>
   What does marriage mean to us?
</P>
<P>
   Do we want to have children?
</P>
<P>
   If we were not raised in the same faith, how will we handle
that? What religion will we raise our children in?
</P>
<P>
   Do my parents accept him? Do his parents accept me?
</P>
<P>
   Do we have something in common, a hobby, sport or interest, that
we enjoy in our spare time?
</P>
<P>
   Do we have friends in common?
</P>
<P>
   What ideas do we have about the roles of husbands and wives: Is
he going to expect me to do all the housework; do I expect him to
make more money?
</P>
<P>
   Are we both ready to make a commitment?
</P>

I hadn't noticed _ a small piece of wood taped to the outside of
the door above my eye line, with the name of a Serbian family
printed in pencil. The previous evening, after we discovered the
break-in attempt, we had been sufficiently nervous to look for
help. NATO troops headquartered across the street had pronounced
repeatedly their mission to provide security for all the people of
Kosovo. That very day NATO announced it had taken over police
powers, so my colleague and I sharing this apartment figured they
could swing a patrol down our street. If the troops didn't care
much about a couple of western journalists, surely they would worry
about Serbian families we found also had been targeted in our

 &HT;    Nowadays, comics are a joke
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ One of the several frustrations of senior
citizenship is being unable to understand newspaper comics, which,
in addition to being nonsensical, require a magnifying glass to
decipher the small print in postage-stamp-size panels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you figure out the comics?'' I asked my wife. Being a
former child bride and not yet eligible for Medicare, I thought she
might understand contemporary humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days I get the point in `Baby Blues' and `Herman,' but
most of the others are a puzzle,'' she admitted. ``They're as
incomprehensible as television commercials.''
</P>
<P>
   I liked the comics when they were called funny papers and you
couldn't cover up three separate strips with your palm and four
fingers. I miss Dick Tracy and his two-way wrist radio, a truly
miraculous means of communication that somehow preceded invention
of the computer chip. It was as far out as Flash Gordon's
spaceship.
</P>
<P>
   I miss ``Smilin' Jack,'' ``Steve Canyon'' and ``Little Orphan
Annie,'' although I was rather late in life realizing Daddy
Warbucks made his fortune in World War I profiteering. Social
issues infiltrated the comics long before ``Doonesbury.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd enjoy another Sunday with the Katzenjammer Kids and the
Gumps, back when a single comic took up half a page and you didn't
have to be an Ivy League egghead to figure out what it was about.
</P>
<P>
   Like many children of my generation, I learned to read by having
the funny papers read to me. Later I moved on to the sports
section, then the front page and eventually to the editorial page.
Most of what I know comes from reading newspapers, and limited as I
am, I wonder if I'd be any better off if surfing the Internet had
been an option.
</P>
<P>
   One of my advantages was being able to read the funny papers in
three different newspapers. We took the Georgian. One grandmother
took The Atlanta Journal, and one took The Atlanta Constitution,
all within walking distance. One of my favorite strips ran in the
Georgian, a Hearst newspaper, when Atlanta was a three-newspaper
town. I was particularly fond of Secret Agent X-9, who was always
getting into perilous situations.
</P>
<P>
   X-9 had been captured by very bad people. He was hanging from a
rock cliff with his hands and feet tied together when the Georgian
hit on hard times and went out of my life. I stayed awake nights
worrying about Secret Agent X-9.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a practice rather common in the depressed rural South
I was able to enjoy the Georgian's comics section long after the
newspaper was extinct. Our across-the-road neighbors, in an attempt
to brighten their three-room cabin, and to keep winter winds from
blowing through cracks, had papered a bedroom wall with Sunday
color comics from the Georgian. I spent many a pleasant afternoon
reading those walls.
</P>
<P>
   I still had a lot to learn about comics when my grown-up job
included picking the ones that ran in the newspaper. Newspapers buy
comics from syndicate salesmen, a breed not unlike old-time
drummers who traveled back roads peddling their wares to country
storekeepers. Syndicate salesmen try to persuade editors to throw
out some other salesman's comic and buy theirs. They always have a
new strip that's on the cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   According to their sales pitch, if you don't buy it you risk
becoming a national laughingstock and seeing your newspaper go out
of business. If you do buy, you have to throw out one of the old
comics to make room, and that gets upset readers on the phone.
Editors, by nature very nervous people, are afraid to buy a new
comic, and afraid not to.
</P>
<P>
   They often ask advice from associates. When I was a relatively
youthful sportswriter, our editor invited me to evaluate a new
comic he was considering. I told him nobody in the United States
would be interested in a Cockney ne'er-do-well fussing with his
wife and guzzling beer in an English pub. We just wouldn't get it.
``Andy Capp'' turned out to be one of the most popular comics ever
to appear in The Atlanta Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the comics I bought on my tour at the
Journal-Constitution, only one survives. It's ``Cathy.''
``Peanuts'' and ``Nancy'' preceded me. ``Mary Worth'' is about the
same age as Martha Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When a syndicate man (excuse me, but I never met a syndicate
woman) came to peddle ``Cathy,'' I wasn't interested. I thought it
poorly drawn and humorless. I wasn't about to put ``Cathy'' in the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   My secretary-assistant, Jean Stanley, thought otherwise. She
liked ``Cathy.'' Since Miss Stanley was such a good secretary, so
diligent at keeping reporters' expense reports honest, and keeping
me out of trouble, I decided what the heck. If Miss Stanley wanted
``Cathy'' in the newspaper, we'd put ``Cathy'' in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious I'm as out-of-date as ``Dick Tracy,'' ``Smilin'
Jack,'' ``Little Orphan Annie'' and the Gump boys. But I'd still
like to know whatever happened to Secret Agent X-9.

 &HT;    Citified nannies ignore rest of Texas in killing speed-limit
boost
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The recent legislative session showed again that
Texas lawmakers are more in touch with urban sprawl and traffic
jams than with cowboys and wide-open spaces.
</P>
<P>
   A reasonable bill to raise speed limits on selected Texas
highways failed to win the approval of Texas' urbanized,
homogenized lawmakers who have more in common with pasty-faced,
Eastern safety nannies than with the land of their more robust
ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   This bred-down flock of quivering lawmakers is more familiar
with traffic lights and skyscrapers than with stars at night big
and bright or prairie skies wide and high.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 years ago, Texas' population began to shift from
the wide-open spaces of its rural heritage to the cities. For most
of Texas' history, rural Texas was heavily represented in the Texas
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The tables have turned. Now a majority of citified Texas
lawmakers are more likely to adopt positions in tune with New York
City than they are to represent vast stretches of their own state.
</P>
<P>
   Just because Texas' heavily urban clusters elect the majority of
the state's legislators does not mean that the rest of the state,
which is still larger than any European nation, has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   On behalf of all those Texans who live where roads run from
horizon to horizon, a lawmaker from West Texas introduced a bill
this past session to allow the raising of speed limits from 75 to
80 in nonurban areas.
</P>
<P>
   The filing of that bill was like firing a 30-30 carbine in the
middle of a herd of bedded-down longhorns. Texas' nervous
safety-nanny delegation screamed, ``Speed kills'' and stampeded off
in a cloud of Gucci loafer tassels to assure urban constituents
that this bill would never become law.
</P>
<P>
   The bill died, of course, which was reason for Texas' Ralph
Nader clones to celebrate with pizza and ice cream, two products
that assuredly kill more Americans annually than are killed due to
posted speed limits.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the facts. The most comprehensive study on speed limits
in 30 years found that speed limits had no meaningful impact on
traffic safety. The study, conducted under the supervision of the
Federal Highway Administration, measured and monitored driver
response to speed limits at 247 locations across the United States
for five years.
</P>
<P>
   After undergoing rigorous peer review, the study showed that
posted speed limits had virtually no influence on driver behavior
or accident rates.
</P>
<P>
   Speed limits have a lot to do with handing out expensive
speeding tickets, but practically nothing to do with safety.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists are not suicidal by nature. Research shows that 85
percent of motorists drive at a speed that is safe for the
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly without exception, American highways are engineered to
safely handle speeds far in excess of posted speed limits. Speed
limits should be set based on an engineering study of the
particular roads and other conditions, not an arbitrary and
needlessly low number.
</P>
<P>
   Natural traffic flow invariably exceeds posted speed limits.
When that happens, slower motorists become a safety hazard.
</P>
<P>
   It's rare that speed alone causes traffic accidents. More often
accidents are caused by bad drivers who use bad judgment by
tailgating, cutting off cars, passing on hills and curves,
recklessly changing lanes or failing to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   Since Congress raised the one-size-fits-all 55 mph national
speed limit, highway fatalities nationwide have dropped by hundreds
rather than increase by the predicted thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Texas needs tougher driving standards and lawmakers more in
touch with their state.

 &HT;    Country museum move new blow to Music Row
 &HT;    By Jane DuBose
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ For more than 30 years, the museum housing
Elvis Presley's 1960 gold Cadillac and Hank Williams' jackets has
been a mainstay of this city's Music Row.
</P>
<P>
   But those days are numbered, and the move of the Country Music
Hall of Fame to downtown Nashville is planned at a time when
country music and Nashville tourism are at a crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, there's been a love-hate relationship between the
recording companies and the tourists,'' says Jim Cook, who owns a
hat shop near the Hall of Fame. ``In a way, they just haven't
wanted to be bothered with tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   If Cook is right, the executives of country music recording
labels may have their wish. At least a dozen tourist shops lining
Demonbreun Avenue have closed in the past two years, and those
remaining have seen significant drops in business.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the city's downtown area just a few blocks away
has been thriving with new theme restaurants, the 3-year-old
Nashville Arena and other attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The new $37 million Hall of Fame will open near the arena in a
city redevelopment district in what was once the fading Lower
Broadway area. The four-story museum will include about 1,000
artifacts and will house a glass-enclosed office where visitors can
see archivists, recording artists and other staff at work
preserving country music's history.
</P>
<P>
   The Country Music Association, which held the museum
groundbreaking ceremony last week, is raising $15 million from
private donors and will contribute $5 million more when it sells
its old property. The rest is coming from city commitments of
industrial development bonds and proceeds from hotel-motel taxes.
The public commitment is much less than that for the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame in Cleveland, says Kyle Young, director of the Country
Music Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The development site will also feature a Hilton hotel opening
next year, a new park and an 86-unit apartment building in a
converted fire station, said Gerald Nicely, who heads Nashville's
redevelopment agency.
</P>
<P>
   The relocated Hall of Fame is scheduled to open in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Young said the museum is not worried about leaving Music Row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many places left before us,'' he said, adding that a new and
expanded museum will boost country music more than staying put in
the old neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   While owners of small shop owners _ and even the annual County
Music Fan Fair _ have suffered the local tourism downturn, the Hall
of Fame itself has not been immune. In the 1980s, the museum
attracted about 500,000 people a year; now there's about 190,000.
Young expects that to increase to 550,000 at the new location,
despite higher ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Waters, a Nashville city councilman representing Music Row,
said the demise of the storefronts has come at a time when tourism
is changing for the city. Bus tours and family groups diminished
when Opryland theme park closed two years ago. At the same time,
Branson, Mo., Pigeon Forge, Tenn., and Myrtle Beach, S.C., began
offering more live entertainment venues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're in a down cycle,'' Waters said. ``But I see
some positive things happening. A study from the city showed this
is a transition time, and we can look for some specialty retail,
boutique shops and a combination of business/office on Music Row in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the bright spots for Music Row is an expected 2001
opening of a Ritz-Carlton hotel developed by Starstruck
Entertainment, owned by entertainer Reba McEntire. And the City
Council will be asked in July to approve $3.5 million in street
improvements to the area.
</P>
<P>
   As the landscape changes, Waters says it's important for
Nashville to market its uniqueness. Nowhere else is country music
recorded in such volumes _ thus the industry side of Music Row
should be heavily promoted, as well as the arena, the Ryman
Auditorium and the Tennessee Titans football team.
</P>
<P>
   Cook says his hat business is evaluating whether to move from
the Music Row area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad thing'' he said. ``Customers come in and ask what's
happened. We're losing the people who made us what we are.''
</P>
<P>
   But Young has another take on the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is doing this, and we need to, too. Every once in a
while, you have to refresh your image.''

 &HT;    Mom's recipes for cleaners still shine
 &HT;    By Amy Kincheloe
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Christine Halvorson said she believes mother knows
best.
</P>
<P>
   Halvorson, who co-wrote ``Clean and Simple'' (Yankee Publishing
Inc.) with her husband, Kenneth M. Sheldon, said the homemade
cleaners from her mother's day are still around the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the commercial products are the same as the homemade
cleaners except they just have fancy names and added colors and
smells,'' sheHalvorson said. ``That all adds to the cost, and they
are less natural than the homemade cleaners.''
</P>
<P>
   Halvorson said items found around the home work well as
cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried out all of the recipes in the book, and our theory is
if you have these five con (oven cleaner, general-purpose cleaner,
easy scrub, heavy-duty disinfectant cleaner and furniture polish)
in your home, you can keep it clean,'' sheHalvorson said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Halvorson's homemade cleaners consist of at least one of
the following: water, lemon juice, dishwashin ol and baking soda,
all of which are fairly inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   But do they work? Products that work
</P>
<P>
   ``Baking soda and vinegar make a great cleaning combination
(when mixed together on the cleaning site),'' sheHalvorson said.
``And baking soda itself is a great light abrasive that doesn't
scratch. Borax has fallen out of favor, but my mother used it and
I'm finding that it works well, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Halvorson said the natural aspect of th ade cleaners is a
definite plus.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do save money and time, and you're not contributing to the
landfills (with commercial cleaner bottles),'' sheHalvorson said.
``The closer you can get to natural products, the better. At least
you know what you've got in front of you _ it's a pure thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Household and Institutional Products Information
Council, an organization representing companies that manufacture
household and institutional care and cleaning products, doesn't
agree with the use of alternative cleaning products.
</P>
<P>
   According to information released by the organization:
``Unfortunately, natural does not mean safe or `nontoxic.' Most
chemical (natural or synthetic) substances, including vinegar,
borax, baking soda and castile soap, have a dose at which they will
cause a toxic response.''
</P>
<P>
   Halvor the recipes for her home cleaners are exact and have not
produced any chemical reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The measurements are precise for optimum cleaning,''
sheHalvorson said.
</P>
<P>
   Always check for warnings on the containers of the ingredients
used for home mixtures. For example, the label on a bottle of
American Fare Ammonia clearly states: ``Do not mix with chlorine
bleach leaner. Combining chemicals can produce poison gas _ results
can be fatal.'' For safety
</P>
<P>
   Also, for safety's sake, Halvorson advises people to label their
homemade cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say it several times throughout the book,'' sheHalvorson
said. ``You don't want to put your homemade concoction in a bottle
without a label. These cleaners are like commercial cleaners and
should be kept under and key and out of a child's reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Halvorson also suggests listin ipe on the container in case of
accidental ingestion by a child and also just to have the recipe
handy the next time a batch needs to be made.
</P>
<P>
   SheHalvorson added, ``It's not to say commercial cleaners don't
rival these, but if you can save a little money and help the
environment, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   MAKE YOUR OWN
</P>
<P>
   Here are some recipes for homemade cleaners from Clean and
Simple by Christine Halvorson and Kenneth M. Sheldon.
</P>
<P>
   OVEN CLEANER
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dishwashing liquid
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons borax
</P>
<P>
   0.25 cup ammonia
</P>
<P>
   1.5 cups warm water
</P>
<P>
   Mix the ingredients together, apply to oven spills and let sit
for 20 to 30 minutes. Scrub with an abrasive nylon-backed sponge
and rinse well.
</P>
<P>
   GENERAL-PURPOSE CLEANER
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon borax
</P>
<P>
   0.5 teaspoon washing soda
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vinegar
</P>
<P>
   0.25 teaspoon dishwashing liquid
</P>
<P>
   2 cups hot water
</P>
<P>
   Combine all of the ingredients. If you don't have washing soda
(generally found in the laundry section of super- markets), use 1
teaspoon baking soda instead. For a more pleasant smell, use lemon
juice instead of vinegar. Be sure to label the bottle accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   EASY SCRUB
</P>
<P>
   0.75 cup baking soda
</P>
<P>
   0.25 cup borax
</P>
<P>
   Dishwashing liquid
</P>
<P>
   Combine the baking soda and borax. Mix in enough dishwashing
liquid to make a smooth paste. If you prefer a pleasant smell, add
1/4 teaspoon lemon juice to the paste.
</P>
<P>
   HEAVY-DUTY DISINFECTANT CLEANER
</P>
<P>
   0.25 cup powdered laundry detergent
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon borax
</P>
<P>
   0.75 cup of hot water
</P>
<P>
   0.25 cup pine oil or pine-based cleaner
</P>
<P>
   Slowly stir the detergent and borax into the water to dissolve.
Add the pine oil (available at hardware stores and supermarkets)
and mix well. For bathroom cleaning, use the mixture full strength.
In the kitchen, dilute with water.
</P>
<P>
   FURNITURE POLISH
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vinegar or lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon boiled linseed oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon turpentine
</P>
<P>
   Combine the ingredients in a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid
and shake until blended. Dampen a cloth with cold water and wring
it out until it's as dry as you can get it. Saturate the cloth with
the mixture and apply sparingly to a small area at a time. Let dry
for 30 minutes, then polish with a soft cloth. Note that this
mixture gets gummy as it sits, so make just enough for one day's
work.
</P>
<P>
   GLASS CLEANER
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons ammonia
</P>
<P>
   0.5 cup alcohol
</P>
<P>
   0.25 teaspoon dishwashing liquid
</P>
<P>
   A few drops blue food coloring
</P>
<P>
   Water
</P>
<P>
   Combine the ammonia, alcohol, dishwashing liquid and food
coloring,then add enough water to make 1 quart.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer a non-ammoniated cleaner, substitute 3 tablespoons
vinegar or lemon juice for the ammonia. CUTLINES Staff photos _

   IZBICA, Yugoslavia _ Churned earth has replaced the neat rows of
mounds that told the world a mass grave was here.
</P>
<P>
   A few detached body parts may remain in the clods of dirt, along
with the errant shoe or muddy blanket once used to wrap a body. But
gone are the corpses, the most compelling evidence of a heinous
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were removed to destroy the evidence, to destroy the
facts,'' said Sadik Gjemajli (pronounced, ``Jie-MY-lee), the local
commander of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the Izbica (pronounced, Is-BEE-tsa) massacre, in
which more than 140 people are said to have been executed, is one
of seven in the four-count indictment against Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and four cohorts for war crimes in Kosovo, a
province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Gjemajli and other eyewitnesses said Serb soldiers returned here
three days before the Yugoslav army agreed on June 10 to withdraw
troops and spent two days digging up the graves, removing the
corpses, and then setting afire a wagon load of grave markers and
blankets that had wrapped the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The grave robbers were trying to rob the world of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, that justice will be
terribly difficult to attain even where there has not been
intentional evidence tampering. There is ample opportunity for
evidence to be ruined simply by the passage of time and intrusion
of innocent people to crime scenes that have no guard, no fences or
even any markings.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, confusing conditions of continued danger, bad
communications and hard travel contribute to delays in
investigations by The Hague tribunal on war crimes in the former
Yugoslavia, the body that indicted Milosevic and four of his
leading cohorts.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic teams began probing through alleged sites in Kosovo
last week, including from Britain's Scotland Yard, America's FBI
and Canada's Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   But they are the second stage of the investigative process,
according to Paul Risley, spokesman for The Hague tribunal, while
thus far the crucial first stage hasn't even been carried out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In each of these cases, we have soldiers secure the sites,''
Risley said, speaking of NATO troops in the KFOR, or Kosovo Force,
taking over the seven sites of alleged atrocities listed in the
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   War crimes forensic investigators finally were reported on the
scene at Djakovica on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a limited window of opportunity for (collecting) the
surface evidence -- tire marks, footprints, bloodstains,'' he said,
emphasizing the need for quick forensic assessments at protected
sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern Kosovo town of Djakovica, the crumbling house
where an estimated 20 women, children and elderly people were
burned alive still sat open last week to the elements and to
intruders. The attack on this modest home on the night of April 1
also is listed in the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor poked through the charred remains of the house,
picking up pieces of human bone with a pair of pliers, just out of
curiosity. One piece was potentially important as evidence that
might help identify a victim -- a piece of jawbone with a tooth
still attached. Other visitors urged him not to disturb the site,
and certainly not to take away any of the gruesome mementos he
inexplicably was hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Less grisly artifacts are popular souvenirs, such as spent
bullet casings that also could be useful to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Nor at mid-week was there any sign of KFOR protecting anything
within miles of Izbica, a village in the central Kosovo region that
was a KLA stronghold and was thoroughly routed by Serb troops. It
is a place reached after winding down rocky dirt roads, where cows
may as easily wander through the remnants of mass graves as through
adjacent grasslands.
</P>
<P>
   With the bodies of dead villagers missing, any evidence left
gains in importance.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the victims clearly have been moving through the
site, if only to replace grave markers bowled over by Serb backhoes
-- despite the fact that the bodies are gone. Tire marks by now
have been largely mixed with the treads of tractors and mushed
under heavy pelts of rain.
</P>
<P>
   The corpses would be the best evidence, holding bullets that
might be identified as Yugoslav military issue and other signs
indicating the manner of death. And of course, the identification
-- and even the numbers -- of the victims now is a matter of
hearsay, based on lists the KLA and villagers compiled before they
buried their friends and loved ones. There also is a video-tape of
some stages of the burials.
</P>
<P>
   The graves first appeared in NATO spy satellite photographs in
early April, and were publicized as evidence of Serb atrocities.
That alone might have been sufficient to provoke efforts to erase
proof of the crime, but then additional publicity drew more
attention to it.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-April Cox Newspapers interviewed villagers who said they
buried the bodies after a Serb massacre, and the video-tape
surfaced later and was shown on CNN news broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Izbica is not the only place Serb forces are reported to have
dug up and removed corpses. Risley said the tribunal has received a
number of such reports, about Yugoslav authorities saying their
forces discovered the mass graves and identified the corpses as
``victims of terrorist attacks'' which the Serb troops then removed
and humanely gave a decent burial in individual, marked graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see this as a kind of very sophisticated effort to
hide the evidence,'' he said. ``That in itself would be a specific
kind of war crime committed by the military units.''
</P>
<P>
   Additional indictments against other aggressors and possibly
more charges against Milosevic are expected, he said.

   IZBICA, Yugoslavia _ The story of the Izbica massacre, in which
more than 130 people are said to have been executed, is one of
seven in the four-count indictment against Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and four cohorts -- Milan Milutinovic, Nikola
Sainovic, Dragoljub Ojdanic, and Vlajko Stojiljkovic -- for war
crimes in Kosovo. Following is a list of the counts and alleged
atrocities in the indictment:
</P>
<P>
   COUNTS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1 _ Deportation, a CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY, punishable under
Article 5(d) of the Statute of the Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  2 _ Murder, a CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY, punishable under Article
5 (a) of the Statute of the Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3 _ Murder, a VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OR CUSTOMS OF WAR,
punishable under Article 3 of the Statute of the Tribunal and
recognized by Article 3(1)(a) (murder) of the Geneva Conventions.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  4 _ Persecutions on political, racial and religious grounds, a
CRIME AGAINST
</P>
<P>
   HUMANITY, punishable under Article 5(h) of the Statute of the
Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   ATROCITIES
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges that beginning on or about Jan. 1, 1999
up until the date of the indictment in late May, Yugoslav and Serb
forces, under the direction of Milosevic and his cohorts, murdered
hundreds of Kosovar Albanian civilians ``in a widespread or
systematic manner,'' including:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On or about Jan. 15, 1999, in the early morning hours, the
village of Racak (Stimlje/Shtime municipality) was attacked by
Yugoslav and Serb forces. After shelling by Yugoslav troops, the
Serb police entered the village later in the morning and began
conducting house-to-house searches. Villagers, who attempted to
flee from the Serb police, were shot throughout the village. A
group of about 25 men attempted to hide in a building, but were
discovered by the Serb police. They were beaten and then were
removed to a nearby hill, where the policemen shot and killed them.
Altogether, the Yugoslav and Serb forces killed about 45 Kosovar
Albanians in and around Racak.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On or about March 25, Yugoslav and Serb forces attacked the
village of Bela Crkva (Orahovac/Rahovec municipality). Many of the
residents of Bela Crkva fled into a streambed outside the village
and sought shelter under a railroad bridge. As additional villagers
approached the bridge, a Serb police patrol opened fire on them
killing 12 persons, including 10 women and children. The police
then ordered the remaining villagers out of the
</P>
<P>
   streambed, at which time the men were separated from the women
and small children. The police ordered the men to strip and then
systematically robbed them of all valuables. The women and children
were then ordered to leave. The village doctor attempted to speak
with the police commander, but he was shot and killed, as was his
nephew. The other men were then ordered back into the streambed.
After they complied, the police opened fire on the men,
</P>
<P>
   killing about 65 Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On or about March 25, the villages of Velika Krusa and Mali
Krusa/Krushe e Mahde and Krushe e Vogel (Orahovac/Rahovec
municipality) were attacked by Yugoslav and Serb forces. Village
residents took refuge in a forested area outside Velika
Krusa/Krushe e Mahde, where they were able to observe the police
systematically looting and then burning the villagers' houses. On
or about the morning of March 26, Serb police located the villagers
in the forest. The police ordered the women and small children to
leave the area and to go to Albania. The police then searched the
men and boys and took their identity documents, after which they
were made to walk to an uninhabited house between the forest and
Mali Krusa/Krushe e Vogel. Once the men and boys were assembled
inside the house, the Serb police opened fire on the group. After
several minutes of gunfire, the police piled hay on the men and
boys and set fire to it in order to burn the bodies. As a result of
the shootings and the fire, about 105 Kosovar Albanian men and boys
were killed by the Serb police.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On or about the evening of March 26, in the town of
Dakovica/Gjakove, Serb gunmen came to a house on Ymer Grezda
Street. The women and children inside the house were separated from
the men, and were ordered to go upstairs. The Serb gunmen then shot
and killed the six Kosovar Albanian men who were in the house.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On or about March 27, in the morning hours, Yugoslav and Serb
forces attacked the village of Crkolez/Padalishte (Istok/Istog
municipality). As the forces entered the village, they fired on
houses and on villagers who attempted to flee. Eight members of the
Beke Imeraj family were forced from their home and were killed in
front of their house. Other residents of Crkolez/Padalishte were
killed at their homes and in a streambed near the village.
Altogether, Serb forces killed about 20 Kosovar Albanians from
Crkolez/Padalishte.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On or about March 27, Yugoslav and Serb forces attacked the
village of Izbica (Srbica/Skenderaj municipality). Several thousand
village residents took refuge in a meadow outside the village. On
or about March 28, Serb forces surrounded the villagers and then
approached them, demanding money. After valuables were stolen by
the soldiers and policemen, the men were separated from the women
and small children. The men were then further divided into two
groups, one of which was sent to a nearby hill, and the other of
which was sent to a nearby streambed. Both groups of men were then
fired upon by Serb troops, and about 130 Kosovo Albanian men were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On or about the early morning hours of April 2, Serb police
launched an operation against the Qerim district of
Dakovica/Gjakove . Over a period of several hours, Serb police
forcibly entered houses of Kosovar Albanians in the Qerim district,
killing the occupants, and then setting fire to the buildings. In
the basement of a house on Millosh Gilic Street, the Serb police
shot the 20 occupants and then set the house on fire. As a result
of the shootings
</P>
<P>
   and the fires set by the Serb police, 20 Kosovar Albanians were
killed, of whom 19 were women and children.

COLLECTING BEANIE BABIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES A. FUSSELL  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hmm, now where have we seen this before? Hot toys in hundreds of
colorful variations, each with its own personality, name and
oh-so-collectible identity.
</P>
<P>
   Can you say Beanie Babies?
</P>
<P>
   Other toy companies can. Fueled by the phenomenal success of the
ubiquitous bean bag toys, they're seeking success with some of the
same marketing techniques that turned Beanies into a cuddly money
machine.`
</P>
<P>
   Recognize these strategies?
</P>
<P>
   - Instead of making just one style of toy, make more than 100,
and feature them in a collect-them-all series.
</P>
<P>
   - Introduce sought-after limited ``special editions.''
</P>
<P>
   - ``Retire'' early versions to ratchet up the desire.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Crazy Bones, a popular new game aimed at elementary school
children that uses the same marketing techniques. The game pieces _
often called ``Bones'' or ``Go-Gos'' _ consist of more than 100
miniature, plastic figures to play with, collect, trade and win.
The bones, slightly larger than standard marbles, come in about 90
different colors, and are shaped to fit their names. (A bone named
``Frenchie'' looks like a bag of French fries, while ``Gu-Gu
Ga-Ga'' resembles a little baby bottle.) Each $2 pack contains
three to five bones, but the opaque packages prevent collectors
from seeing what pieces they're buying. And don't look now, kids,
but the first series of 60 original Bones has just been retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, these are going to be as big as Beanie Babies,'' one
excited child told his mother at a recent Crazy Bones night
organized at Zainy Brainy, a local toy store in South Overland
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Pokemon (say poke-ee-mohn) toys. Pokemon _ a group
of 150 small, colorful cartoon characters, each with its own
personality, name and collectible identity, are seemingly
everywhere these days. Besides being the subject of a children's
cartoon, the characters also appear in a video game and as various
other toys. Hasbro, which manufacturers Pokemon toys, makes
products ranging from super balls, battlepacks and blasters to
electronic figures, plush toys and trading cards.
</P>
<P>
   The Pokemon motto: ``Gotta catch em all!''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of luck. Certain plush toys are often in short supply, and
some of the trading cards already have been retired.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on in toyland?
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Annicelli, the associate editor of Playthings, a magazine
that tracks the toy industry, thinks he knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collectibility is definitely one of the most popular ways for
toy companies to get consumers buying their products as often as
possible,'' Annicelli said. ``It's not a new phenomenon; there have
always been collectible toys. But the difference now is that the
manufacturers are a lot more overt about marketing things, about
being collectible. In the past, say with action figures, you had to
have six or eight to have a good play experience. Now you have to
collect all the Beanie Babies, or all the Crazy Bones or all the
Pokemon. The new wrinkle is toy companies retiring their toys.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired toys sell for much more than their original asking
price. For example, Ty Inc. sells its basic Beanie Baby for $6 or
$7. But recently retired Beanies bring from $15 to $50, with the
rarest fetching more than a thousand on Internet auction sites.
</P>
<P>
   What does this new strategy mean?
</P>
<P>
   ``It means,'' Annicelli said, ``that now, as well as being
collectible, certain toys will only be availible in limited numbers
or for a limited amount of time. That causes a feeling that if you
are going to collect these toys you better collect them now, or it
will be your last change. It creates a sense of urgency in the
collector.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents called the marketing techniques innocuous, others
disagreed. Julianne Graves, a Kansas City mother of two, called the
techniques ``manipulative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems to me that toymakers try less to make good
products than to create these engineered sensations,'' she said.
``And that kind of bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter, said Jay Winter, a Southern California toy analyst.
You'll see more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way to sell something,'' he said. ``Make hundreds
of them, get everybody competing for them, then, wham! Limit their
numbers. It's human nature. It's pushing all the buttons. Greed,
competition, desire, desperation. But how many products you have
using this strategy is still an open question. You still have to
have a product that somebody wants. And that title still goes to
Beanie Babies.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's, of course, has raised that strategy to a fine art by
offering Teeny Beanie Babies in its Happy Meals.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Barneson, a New York marketing expert, said the marketing
of Beanies with Happy Meals is far more important than the food
that's included.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food is superfluous,'' he said. ``It's all about the toys,
and the unbelievable hype that's been created. Collectors are
hooked and they can't turn back... And since (Beanies) will only be
offered for a limited time... they've created the ultimate
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The same strategies are working, on a smaller scale, for Crazy
Bones. The colorful bones _ and the games you can play with them _
have become a craze at more than a few area elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been taking them to school and trading them on the
playground,'' Julia McCullough of Overland Park said of her two
sons, Adam and Matt. McCullough and other mothers said they
recognized a Beanie Baby-style marketing technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some special ones you can get,'' said Betty Mapes of
Leawood, ``and then they retire some, too. It's the same
philosophy. (My 9-year-old son, Danny) just told me I have to go
buy a bunch of Crazy Bones.
</P>
<P>
   Danny also collects Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's 150,'' Mapes said. ``You have to collect them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny,'' she called. ``How many Pokemon do you have now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A hundred and thirty nine,'' he called back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's captured 139 of them on his Game Boy,'' she said. ``There
are also trading cards. But you can't get those cause the adults
keep buying them,'' she said, ``It's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   For some reason collecting in general has gone crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Take Pez dispensers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been collectors,'' said Scott McWhinnie, the
president of Pez Candy Co. Inc. ``But it's bigger than ever now.
There are auctions at Christie's. There are five, six, seven
conventions around the country. There are books, 70 websites, there
are chat rooms with people sitting on line talking about Pez. It's
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Collecting baseball cards, autographs and sports memorabilia has
turned from largely a child's pastime to a multi-billion dollar
industry dominated by adults. Even something as classic as the
Barbie doll has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, many girls had just one or two Barbies, a Ken doll
and some friends. Once people had the core dolls, they didn't need
others.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until Mattel changed its marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Barbies have distinct identities _ Doctor Barbie, Mermaid
Barbie, Cheerleader Barbie and so on _ thereby allowing Mattel to
sell the doll multiple times. In addition, Mattel also markets
``instant'' collector Barbies for hundreds of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world of toy collecting has changed from when I was a
kid,'' said Winter. ``And it's marketing that's changed it.''

A&AMP;E'S BILL KURTIS HAS HIS DREAM JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON BARNHART  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star

<P>
   A&AMP;E's Bill Kurtis has his dream job _ and in Kansas, his dream
</P>
<P>
   home
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Bill Kurtis seemed ready to do a slow fade from
television just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But look at him now. The old-school broadcaster and native
Kansan has emerged as one of cable's brand names.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 tonight, ``Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis'' begins
a new five-nights-a-week schedule on A&AMP;E, where viewers in recent
years have become accustomed to Kurtis's authoritative presence.
This week the show devotes itself to ``Guns in America,'' a look
into the country's firearms culture.
</P>
<P>
   From his first job at WIBW in Topeka, where he spent a legendary
night in 1966 covering a tornado, Kurtis had won respect for his
no-nonsense style and fame for his commanding air and distinctive
voice.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 years _ which included stints in Chicago and a national
presence on CBS _ Kurtis scaled down his on-air duties. He started
traveling more. And he devoted more time to a small side business _
making documentaries for cable.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about great timing. Just as Kurtis's network career was
winding down, cable TV was taking off. And fueling that rocket was
original, nonfiction programming, the kind Kurtis would learn to
crank out in volume.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with a single documentary he peddled to the A&AMP;E
network 10 years ago, Kurtis has made himself the network's
signature player in the genre. His production company now supplies
A&AMP;E with 12 to 16 hours a year of documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtis also began narrating other producers' work for A&AMP;E. From
the blood-and-guts of ``American Justice'' to the UFO weirdness of
``The Unexplained,'' Kurtis' sing-songy baritone can be heard night
and day on A&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
   Together Kurtis and the network prospered.
</P>
<P>
   Did Kurtis, a native of Independence, Kan., ever imagine it
would turn out this way? Or that after avoiding Kansas for most of
his adult life, he'd buy a 7,000-acre cattle ranch near his
hometown?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea,'' he says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary age
</P>
<P>
   Three floors down from the offices of Kurtis Productions, there
resides a million-dollar ``virtual set.'' On first sight it appears
to be little more than one giant blue panel leaning against a blue
floor. But a nearby TV monitor shows an entirely different picture.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to powerful Silicon Graphics computers, a
realistic-looking facade is imposed behind and around Kurtis as he
walks and talks around the set. There are hand railings, spinning
kiosks and picture-in-picture video. Incredibly, they are kept in
perfect perspective no matter how or where the camera moves.
</P>
<P>
   Every year on this set _ one of a handful that exist in the
Midwest _ Kurtis supplies ``wraps'' (beginnings and endings) to
more than 120 new hours of A&AMP;E programming, including his own
projects.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sexy side of documentary work. Here's the other side:
a 4-foot-square booth, lined top to bottom with eggshell foam, with
a microphone and a 2-inch TV screen on a table.
</P>
<P>
   In this stifling closet down the hall from his office, Kurtis
logs four hours at a time reading narration. He calls it his
``secret weapon,'' because he matches his audio to the finished
video as it rolls on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   While showing a visitor the room, Kurtis can't help getting in a
little dig at PBS, the network that treated him like just another
producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of PBS documentaries, they have that disembodied feel to
them,'' he says. ``I mean, nice voice, but...''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, nice voice, but Kurtis didn't get into this line of work
just because he had great pipes. He longed to be a documentary
producer, a noble profession the networks used to support before
news became a bottom-line-driven business.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtis built his reputation in the 1970s and '80s at WBBM, the
CBS-owned station in Chicago. In 1982, he landed a network job
alongside Phyllis George at the ``CBS Morning News'' in New York.
Three years later, with the show (then as now) stuck in third
place, he returned to WBBM.
</P>
<P>
   But local news was no longer satisfying for Kurtis. He spent his
final years reading trashy tabloid stories alongside younger talent
he barely knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like seeing a great baseball player on a very bad
team,'' says P.J. Bednarski, the former TV critic at the Chicago
Sun-Times.
</P>
<P>
   In his contract, however, CBS had agreed to finance five
episodes of a series he named ``The New Explorers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't claim to be as pres-ci-ent as one might,'' says Kurtis
with his emphatic diction, which sometimes borders on self-parody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was following what I wanted to do. I didn't even know what I
was doing _ how much it was going to cost. I think I did only two a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Kurtis found a home for ``The New Explorers'' at the
Chicago PBS affiliate for seven years. That led him to A&AMP;E, to whom
he had sold a special years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 he launched ``Investigative Reports,'' his own A&AMP;E
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill's not an overnight sensation for us,'' says A&AMP;E executive
producer Michael Cascio. ``This is a long-term plan for us. And
it's a dream for Bill and for me to do a single-subject hour
documentary every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to Kansas
</P>
<P>
   There's another dream Kurtis has nurtured, but only for about
four years. It materialized when he was back in Kansas visiting his
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was dutifully driving them around, and we were about 40
miles west of my hometown of Independence and I said, 'What's
this?' '' Informed that he was looking at the Flint Hills, Kurtis
exclaimed, ``This is like Africa!''
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, a cousin approached him with the idea of going
in on a grass-fed cattle ranch in neighboring Chautauqua county,
near Sedan. Suddenly smitten, Kurtis said yes. The two men now
raise 300 head of cattle for the Tallgrass Prairie Producers
Co-operative of Elmsdale, Kan., which sells their beef to natural
food stores.
</P>
<P>
   His enthusiasm for Kansas has spread to increasing tourism. A
couple of weeks ago, he had the Sedan Chamber of Commerce over to
the ranch for a barbecue and to talk about luring more city folk to
their area. He's trying to buy up the land surrounding the site of
Laura Ingalls Wilder's ``little house on the prairie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a kind of spiritual thing for me as I go back to
the land,'' Kurtis says.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to believe that Kurtis is only now going back to Kansas,
which served him so well at the dawn of his broadcast career.
</P>
<P>
   The legend is this: Kurtis worked at WIBW while putting himself
through college at the University of Kansas, where he earned his
journalism degree, and law school at Washburn University. One hot
July afternoon in 1966, he was reading the 6 o'clock news when a
bulletin was handed to him: High winds coming in from Manhattan.
During the 7 p.m. station break, he went on the air to read a
weather advisory.
</P>
<P>
   As he did, recalls Kurtis, the studio camera operator yelled
from off-camera that ``Ed Rutherford _ who is our other cameraman _
is at Burnett's Mound, and there's a tornado. Headed...for the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurtis stayed on the air. ``The next bulletin that came 30
seconds later was: The Huntington apartments have just been wiped
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huntington was on the southwest edge of Topeka, not far from
the Washburn campus, where his wife and child were. Kurtis
responded viscerally. He faced the camera and blurted out, ``For
God's sake, take cover!''
</P>
<P>
   Kurtis stayed at his post for the next 24 hours while the
station's reporters roamed the city, reporting damage. In those
days, WIBW's closest competitors were 60 miles away in Kansas City,
so it had the tornado to itself.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in a glass case behind the receptionist at the WIBW
studios, you can still see the black-and-white photograph of young
Kurtis at the anchor desk in a white-sleeved shirt, his famous
exclamation printed in big letters next to his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody laughs at it now, but...it got the job done,'' says
Kurtis.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Kurtis sees his move to cable as a return to the style
of broadcasting he did in Topeka, a form of narrowcasting, really,
except to a national audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like getting back to that local station for me,
because all I have to do is serve my viewers,'' says Kurtis. And
who wouldn't want to have A&AMP;E's viewers? ``They're highly educated.
They make a lot of money. They obviously like contemporary
documentaries. They're waiting to hear from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kurtis smiles and adds, ``So I've come full circle.''

ST. LOUIS COMPANY OFFERS OUTRAGEOUS UPDATES OF MOZART AND MORE 
</HEADLINE>
 LOUIS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANTRELL  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Opera isn't what it used to be, and a new production
of ``The Marriage of Figaro'' proved that Opera Theatre of St.
Louis is holding its place in the art form's vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which presents four productions each summer at the
Loretto-Hilton Center of Webster University in Webster Groves, has
made its name with new and off-the-beaten-path operas. Even
standard repertory tends to be presented in nonstandard versions _
and often controversial stagings.
</P>
<P>
   Updated to what looked like a cheesily pretentious hotel hallway
lined with mauve doors (Miami Beach's Fontainebleau, maybe?),
Christopher Alden's staging of ``The Marriage of Figaro'' pushed
all kinds of envelopes.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about en famille _ at one time or other, we saw virtually
every member of the Almaviva household in his or her smalls: bras
and slips, silk and cotton boxers. Marcellina, a woman of a certain
age, stripped to a black lace bustier suggesting she'd been
e-shopping at Frederick's of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   But it also rang true to Mozart's own revolutionary _ and
irreverent _ spirit. An ``Othello'' strained at no novelty, but
dramatically and musically it was strong and affecting.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the season were a newly commissioned opera, ``The
Merchant and the Pauper,'' by American composer Paul Schoenfield,
and a reconstruction of the original spoken-dialogue version of
``The Pearl Fishers.''
</P>
<P>
   Presented separately at the Center of Contemporary Arts in
University City were five performances of a new one-hour opera for
young people, ``Joshua's Boots,'' with a libretto by Kansas
City-bred Susan Kander. (See companion story.)
</P>
<P>
   Three performances remain in the current festival: ``The
Marriage of Figaro'' at 1 p.m. today, followed by ``Othello'' at 8
p.m. and ``The Merchant and the Pauper'' at 7 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Cartoon opera
</P>
<P>
   ``The Merchant and the Pauper'' is based on a parable by Rabbi
Nachman, a Hasidic cleric who lived in turn-of-the-19th-century
Ukraine. The libretto is by Maggie Stearns, Opera Theatre's
much-loved director of communications.
</P>
<P>
   The prosperous Merchant supports the Pauper and rescues his wife
from an abduction. But with rich nobles offering money for the hand
of his daughter, Beauty, the Pauper turns his back on his
benefactor and sets his ruin in motion.
</P>
<P>
   Although Beauty has been promised to the Merchant's Son, the
Pauper, now wealthy and powerful, sends the Son fleeing into exile.
But the young lovers are reunited when Beauty is shipwrecked on the
same island. They return home to be married, everything is put
right and presumably everyone lives happily ever after.
</P>
<P>
   Tying the action together and supplying background is a
Narrator, who sings a little but mostly speaks. In the St. Louis
staging he was effectively portrayed by Spiro Malos _ warm of voice
and manner _ as Rabbi Nachman himself.
</P>
<P>
   By definition, these are cartoon characters. And they were made
all the more so in a Mark Lamos staging about as subtle as a silent
movie. (I thought these exaggerated gesticulations died with the
Keystone Kops.)
</P>
<P>
   Although the opera got enthusiastic notices in The New York
Times and The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, this observer was put off by
music that sounded like a cross between Kurt Weill and ``Fiddler on
the Roof.'' Largely conjunct, rhythmically straightforward, the
vocal writing was easy on voice and ear, but it registered little
personality.
</P>
<P>
   Within the constraints, Thomas Barrett's brought dignity and a
resonant baritone to the role of the Merchant. Thomas Trotter was a
sniveling, thoroughly annoying Pauper. Marcus DeLoach was appealing
as the Merchant's Son, his handsome baritone compromised only by
some suspect intonation.
</P>
<P>
   Both visually and vocally, Madeline Bender was well cast as
Beauty. Yaacov Zamir's hooty countertenor made for a suitably slimy
Wicked General and Pirate.
</P>
<P>
   Sets by Andrew Lieberman and costumes by Constance Hoffman
mingled Nachman-period historicism with childlike fantasy.
Christopher Akerlind's lighting, so effective in the three other
Opera Theatre productions, was unsubtle. John DeMain was the
assured conductor.
</P>
<P>
   Irreverent, loving `Figaro'
</P>
<P>
   An arc of hotel-room doors announced right at the start that
this would be very much a slamming-door-farce ``Figaro.'' With the
dramatis personae so much of the time in either underwear or
sleepwear, the production also underlined the domesticity of the
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   When on the job, Susanna was done up as a hotel maid, Figaro as
a waiter in a suit with an apron. Marcellina, usually portrayed as
a haggish old woman, here showed up in quite a snazzy dress; her
employer, Dr. Bartolo, mostly appeared in the lawyer's
quintessential pinstripe suit. But once their old liaison was
revealed _ and apparently rekindled _ here they were bumping and
grinding in their underthings.
</P>
<P>
   Basilio, the music master, was turned into a slithery queen,
with a towering bouffant and outre duds worthy of the creature
formerly known as Prince. Barbarina was a bosomy tart in bright red
skirt, sweater and shoes; her father, the gardener Antonio, sported
his own red suit.
</P>
<P>
   Doubtless there were patrons horrified by the irreverent
updating. But so much of the opera's anti-aristocratic nuance now
so totally eludes us that we might as well transpose its human
drama closer to our own sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   In this case irreverence implied no lack of respect _ indeed,
love _ for the miracle wrought by Mozart and his librettist,
Lorenzo da Ponte. And surely the Mozart who delighted in
scatological humor would have loved it.
</P>
<P>
   The production was blessed with a fine cast: George Cordes as a
warm-toned Figaro, Sari Gruber as a real firecracker of a Susanna,
Deanne Meek as a pert Peter Pan of a Cherubino, Gary Lehman as a
commanding Count, Pamela Armstrong as a passionate Countess.
Praise, too, to Kevin J. Glavin's Bartolo, Kathryn Day's
Marcellina, Jon Kolbet's Basilio and Danielle Martin's Barbarina.
</P>
<P>
   The set designer was Allen Moyer; Gabriel Berry was responsible
for the costumes. I was perplexed only by brief switches to
18th-century duds toward the end.
</P>
<P>
   Matters were less happy in the pit. Alternately hurrying and
dragging, conductor Stefan Lano evinced little feel for singers'
needs to phrase and breathe. Surprisingly rough-hewn playing
suggested that these weren't the St. Louis Symphony's front-chair
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   More lovelorns
</P>
<P>
   The question with ``Othello'' was how Verdi's big-screen
orchestration would adapt to the Loretto-Hilton Center's sonically
cramped pit. But Opera Theatre music director Stephen Lord soon set
worries to rest with an urgent, finely nuanced command of the
score, and the orchestra played its heart out.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Emilia's overdone pawing all over the distraught
Desdemona, director Colin Graham made strong, credible drama with a
capable cast.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Otey brought an admirably muscular baritone to the role of
Iago, and Robert Brubaker's big, commanding tenor underscored
Othello's agony. Marie Plette's diction was mushy, but her ample,
flexible soprano made for a most sympathetic Desdemona. It's too
bad Theodore Green's Cassio was so spongy-toned.
</P>
<P>
   The unit set _ with a huge lion's head, fangs bared, on the left
_ was by Gerard Howland; costumes were by Peter J. Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pearl Fishers'' was mounted in a reconstruction of the
spoken-dialogue version that Bizet wisely discarded before the
premiere. Flimsy to start with, the opera was burdened with Travis
Preston's windily pretentious staging, complete with projected
interpretive titles for each scene.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Barreca's designs and Ellen McCartney's costumes
were fancy tails wagging this mutt of a dog. Was there no one just
to say no?
</P>
<P>
   And here, surely, was a compelling argument for singing in a
language _ any language _ that won't be understood by the audience.
(Commissioned by Opera Theatre, the new translation and performing
edition were by Washington University musicologist Hugh Macdonald.)
The spoken dialogue was delivered in stilted ``stage'' accents.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Ulrich, as Zurga, had a deep, crisp, focused baritone but
also a tendency to sing under pitch. Tenor Gregory Turay, as Nadir,
sounded freer, less forced, than last year, but he and Ulrich were
guilty of much over-singing. (The gentler art of French opera
eludes most singers nowadays.) Mary Dunleavy was a respectable
Leila, Alfred Walker the Nourabad.
</P>
<P>
   Conductor Steuart Bedford evinced little affinity for the score,
and the orchestra responded with coarse, leaden playing. Even Cary
John Franklin's usually splendid chorus sounded out of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   For next season, Opera Theatre's 25th, the lineup will include
the world premiere of Japanese composer Minoru Miki's ``The Tale of
Genji,'' the American professional stage premiere of Handel's
``Radamisto,'' Scott Joplin's ``Treemonisha'' and Verdi's ``La
traviata.''

<P>
   Summertime is party time, so here's your excuse for a
celebration today: The 25th birthday of the supermarket scanner.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, on June 26, 1974, the first item with that little black bar
code was pulled across a grocery store scanner, which read the code
and electronically entered the price in the cash register.
</P>
<P>
   For you trivia buffs: Clyde Dawson made the historic purchase of
a 10-pack of Wrigley's Juicy Fruit Gum (67 cents) at 8:01 a.m. at
the Marsh Supermarket in Troy, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Folks at NCR Corp., the product's maker, suggest celebrating
this ``Silver Scanniversary'' (catchy, eh?) this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear that scanner `beep,' just let it remind you that
your neighborhood retailer is working to transform each transaction
into a stronger relationship with you, their customer,'' said Kelly
Kramer, an NCR spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Oh.

   We were thinking more along the lines of a cupcake with a

HEMINGWAY'S SON SHARES HIS MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICK HEMINGWAY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   People often ask if I knew my father. It is a difficult question
for me to answer politely, and in the reign of Good Queen Bess I
would have been forced to kill the questioner or be killed myself.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I knew my father. When he decided very reluctantly in the
spring of 1944 that he had to go to England to cover as a
journalist the imminent opening of a second front by the Allied
invasion of France, his marriage to Martha Gellhorn was breaking
up, his oldest son, Jack, was already in the Army and a notoriously
poor correspondent, and so it was I, then almost 16, who saw him
off to the war and answered his letters home until he met Mary
Welsh in Europe, who later became the fourth and last Mrs. Ernest
Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   After the letters, I was there to meet him when he came back in
March 1945. He had hitched a ride on a military flight back across
the Atlantic. He later remarked that this experience put an end
forever to what he had once thought of as ``the romance of the
air.''
</P>
<P>
   The only place I can now remember we visited together in the
wartime Big Apple was the gun floor of Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, the
elegant sporting goods emporium that the comedian Dwight Fiske
referred to as ``Abiedabie &AMP; Bitch.'' There he bought a
cadmium-plated, second-hand Merkel over-and-under shotgun, which
was the ugliest object I had ever seen up to that time and it was
very expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Papa,'' I said, ``do you really want to buy this awful
shotgun?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said, ``I knew the Kraut son of a bitch who owned
it. He's dead and I'm still alive.''
</P>

   George Brown, a very sinister Irishman who owned a gym on 55th
Street, who when he boxed with my father would always warn him once
that he was crowding too close and if the warning was not heeded,
then knock him on his ass with the deftness of a striking cobra,
put us both on the train at the old Pennsylvania station for
Florida on the way back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Papa was in bad shape, coughing blood from a persistent
bronchial infection in the days before antibiotics were readily
available and drinking heavily as a home remedy he truly believed
in. I was in charge of a very valuable bottle of Scotch as the
three of us ran, heavily loaded with baggage, down the station
platform to catch the train. I tripped and fell and the bottle of
Scotch smashed to pieces on the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long, dry and very sad trip, first in daylight across
the industrial wasteland of the Jersey marshes and then through the
night to the cabbage palms of south Georgia at first light and the
endless rest of the journey down the length of the Florida
peninsula. We didn't talk much and slept little. When we got to
Miami, Papa said, ``Mouse, I want to tell you about how we took
Paris and a wonderful girl whom I know you will like, although she
is too old for you, but first we have to find a place where I can
get a drink for this cough.''

`RED VIOLIN' IS MUSIC TO THE EYES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Red Violin'' is tough to classify. You could call it an
epic, but that would imply it's long. You could call it an art
film, but that would imply it's dull. You could call it a mystery,
but that would imply that Colonel Mustard just offed someone in the
library with a candlestick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Violin'' is all of that, but it's something else, too:
a breathless fable covering three centuries in the life of a
single, perfect instrument. Hopping the globe from Italy to
Shanghai, intertwining five distinct plots crowded with ideas and
characters, the film is virtuosic filmmaking that dares failure to
a duel and wins. That it winds up with a nick of blood on its cheek
is almost beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   Directed and written by Francois Girard and Don McKellar, the
same duo that made the equally unorthodox ``Thirty-Two Short Films
About Glenn Gould,'' ``The Red Violin'' makes several assumptions,
the most important being that romance boasts no room for
moderation.
</P>
<P>
   Everything's a bold stroke: the acting, the dialogue, the
ecstatic photography (Alain Dostie's) and the unwavering faith in
hyperbole. It is big and dense and gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Glenn Gould,'' ``The Red Violin'' takes a musical conceit
in this case, a riffing portrait of an instrument rather than a
performer and lets fly with the narrative possibilities. It begins
in late-17th century Cremona, Italy, where a master luthier (Carlo
Cecchi) is about to complete his greatest violin. Shortly before
giving birth, his wife (Irene Grazioli) hears her tarot cards read
by a psychic house maid. She later dies in childbirth; her husband,
wracked with grief, varnishes the violin.
</P>
<P>
   With such terse melodrama Girard and McKellar begin their story.
But there's more to this opening than meets the eye: Elements are
left out, not in some pique of editing-room slashing but
intentionally, mysteriously, to seduce us into watching.
</P>
<P>
   At first, we're just confused something's missing. Yet the
brilliance of the film is its stubborn insistence that we take it
on its own terms, that we follow this snaking tale all the way to
the end. Even when it infuriates, it beguiles. Any attempt to
condense the plot would be ill-fated and cruelly unfair, so let's
leave it at this:
</P>
<P>
   Over its 300-year history, the masterwork spends time in the
hands of an orphaned prodigy, a band of gypsies, a demonic (and
Paganini-like) English virtuoso, a pawn shop owner, a conflicted
Maoist operative and a disgraced Chinese music teacher. This
ordered provenance is broken with flash-forwards to a modern-day
auction in Montreal (where Samuel L. Jackson, as a crisp
auction-house expert, investigates the violin's origins) and
flashbacks to eerie tarot sessions in Cremona.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds unwieldy, and it is. Much of this is done so swiftly
that you've barely had time to consider one set of characters
before the next bunch comes waltzing through. And some of the
vignettes work better than others; the scenes involving the English
Paganini (Jason Flemyng, all wild-haired emoting) and his lover
(Greta Scacchi) are crazy chest-heavers, rapturously overdrawn in
the manner of Harlequin Romance book covers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this charms or annoys you will depend on your mood. Yet
it's all of a piece it's all part of an exuberant fairy tale,
rippling with magic and grand swoops of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the general swoop is John Corigiliano's luscious
neo-Romantic score, all of it strings and percussion. Part lament,
part swirling dance, the heart of it is a gypsy-touched minor-key
theme for solo violin, played on the soundtrack by Joshua Bell.
(Bell, who pops up in a don't-blink cameo, served as musical
consultant for the film. McKellar himself appears in a small role.)
</P>
<P>
   Most movies feature music of some sort: a score, a few ambient
tunes, maybe a CD crammed with alt-rock hits. But Girard and
McKellar make films about music, movies in which the least tangible
of arts are given center stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Violin'' concerns a violin, of course, but it also
concerns the mysticism involved in all music-making the charmed
bond between the player and the played that can endure the passage
of centuries. Huge cast or no huge cast, music alone is the star.

KIDS PROGRAM IS THE BEST TV SHOW NO ON TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ This is the best television show not on
television, a kids program that touches on religious themes but is
as cool as ``Davey and Goliath'' was not.
</P>
<P>
   The stars are a cucumber and a tomato, and issues like honesty
and trust and forgiveness and fear are broached with a style that
the makers say combines the sensibilities of Monty Python, Dr.
Seuss and Sunday school.
</P>
<P>
   I tried, but I could not come up with a better characterization.
The theme song says it best: There's never, ever, ever, ever, ever
been a show like ``VeggieTales.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever. Relying on computer animation, writing that is sharper
than most adult shows and humor far funnier than the average
sitcom, ``VeggieTales'' fills a vacuum for moral entertainment for
kids, with a keen eye toward keeping adults laughing at jokes
geared just for them.
</P>
<P>
   Available only on video (major stores and Christian outlets),
sales of half-hour ``VeggieTales'' videos exploded the past two
years, now topping 10 million overall.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, each episode can cost up to $1 million to make
and take up to six months to produce (trust us, the quality looks
it). To build up enough of a catalog to sustain a television series
will take time and tinkering.
</P>
<P>
   Computer animation (think ``Toy Story'') is more like clay
animation (``Davey'') than cell (or traditional) animation in that
the characters take on three-dimensional qualities. Artists still
draw ``key frames'' the major poses of the characters but computers
fill in the missing parts.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it this way: An artist draws A and E; the computer then
supplies the B, C and D. The results are startlingly vivid.
</P>
<P>
   The ``VeggieTales'' concept comes from Phil Vischer, founder and
chief executive of Big Idea Productions (and the voice of Bob the
Tomato) and co-creator Mike Nawrocki (voice of Larry the Cucumber).
</P>
<P>
   The two met at St. Paul Bible College in Minnesota, and were
working together at a Chicago video production house when Vischer
decided to go ahead with his dream of creating an animated
children's show founded on the Bible. Nawrocki signed on as well,
and ``VeggieTales'' was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no mention of (God) in popular children's media,''
Nawrocki said in an interview earlier this week. ``For us, it was
wanting to help kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, back around 1993 or so, distributors were
telling the pair that they loved the video, but didn't think it
would sell with the religious content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody thought it would work commercially,'' Nawrocki said.
``They said, `We love your shows, but we would love them more if
you take the God part out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thank God, and Vischer and Nawrocki, they didn't. Parents soon
realized they had a moral and entertaining alternative to the
Saturday morning fare that was benign at best and virulent at
worst.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the videos click _ there are 11 with a 12th, ``Larry
Boy and Rumor Weed,'' coming out next month _ is that while the
themes taken from the Bible are treated seriously, everything else
is played for laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Spoofs abound, including takes on ``Gilligan's Island,''
``Batman,'' ``Frankenstein,'' ``Grapes of Wrath,'' ``Tales from the
Crypt,'' ``Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' and ``Madame Bovary,''
to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both have offbeat senses of humors,'' said Nawrocki, whose
work with others on non-sequitur songs are fall-down hysterical
(``The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything'' is my favorite music video
of all time, period).
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, we like to write what makes us laugh,'' he continued.
``What we try to do with `VeggieTales' is try to identify a key
value that 4-year-olds understand. From there, we don't write humor
for kids. We write the humor for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Other adults get the joke. At the Living Word Christian Book
Store in East Greenbush, N.Y., clerk Sonia Higgins said
``VeggieTales'' tapes qualify as a best-seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are selling a lot more than other videos,'' Higgins said.
``It's skewed toward younger kids toddlers and up but we have
college kids and adults buying them.''
</P>
<P>
   And laughing at them. What do you know? A truly funny television
show. Too bad it's not on television.

LITTLE TO CHEER IN `BIG DADDY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, those are warm fuzzies breaking out all over Adam Sandler
and cast by the time ``Big Daddy'' comes to its set-up-for-a-sequel
(or a sitcom) close. And yes that might even be a reluctant tear
misting up your eye as a pivotal reunion in Central Park leaves an
irony-lite ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   In the time it'd take to execute a Bobby Boucher flying tackle,
Sandler goes from a guy to whom you'd want to feed a knuckle
sandwich to someone you just want to give a noogie.
</P>
<P>
   After victimizing dozens in previous movies with his
dufus-bullyboy assaults, ``Big Daddy'' finds Sandler playing the
apologist, going the Wallace Beery, Charlie Chaplin route and
stretching his aimless man-child persona around the comic potential
of being a ``dad.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an improbable transition for Sandler's Sonny Koufax, an
aimless Manhattan do-nothing and the world's only 32-year-old
curmudgeon. ``Big Daddy,'' written by Sandler, Steve Franks and Tim
Herlihy and directed by regular Sandler ringmaster Dennis Dugan,
has a great time exploiting that fact, but for some reason
restrains itself.
</P>
<P>
   A turnpike toll-taker with a Syracuse law degree living mostly
off the money he won in a sham lawsuit against a taxi company,
Sonny seems more like he's in early retirement than in a career
funk. His arrested development drives away his girlfriend (Kristy
Swanson) and forces his attorney father (Joseph Bologna) to harass
him long-distance from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   When his traveling roommate's kid, Julian (played by Cole and
Dylan Sprouse), shows up at his apartment door _ instructions
attached _ Sonny uses the situation to convince his now ex-girl to
come home and be ma to his pa.
</P>
<P>
   Really, the kid is an opportunity for Sandler to get his Dr.
Evil working and have a Mini-me of his own. Julian is an
impressionable ragamuffin with that adorable speech impediment that
softens ``l's'' and ``r's'' into ``w's'' and elects to be referred
to as Frankenstein (or ``Fwankenstein'' when he goes third-person.)
Outlandishly, Sonny gives the kid carte blanche to behave ``like a
adult'' (read: doing what he wants and not having to deal with his
old man's taunts the way Sonny has to).
</P>
<P>
   He shows him how to pee in public and trip Rollerbladers, and
lets him play in the autumn puddles in Washington Square Park.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny also teaches young Frank how to get a-third-off dented can
goods at the supermarket, how to help him pick up a new girlfriend
(``Chasing Amy's'' Joey Lauren Adams, the one with the Lollipop Kid
purr) and dirty ways to tease the busty girlfriend (Leslie Mann) of
his roommate (Jon Stewart).
</P>
<P>
   Laughs _ the low-brow, out-loud kind _ come often from Sonny's
child-rearing ineptitude and the eventual tension between pseudo
father and son that makes him aware that he's, uh, created a
monster. But ``Big Daddy,'' risible as it is, is subdued, somber,
where a film like the Jerry- Lewis-on-'roids ``Waterboy'' was
contagiously stupid. As a comedian, Sandler has always been able to
get away with malevolence because his victim-selection is
ridiculously arbitrary and sometimes even cathartic.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Sandler is damned if he develops, damned if he
devolves. But he needn't apologize for being who he is by turning a
gold-mine sitcom into a tame ``Baby Boom'' for guys. Being a jerk
par excellence should mean never having to say you're sorry.

<P>
   ZACATECAS, Mexico _ A welcome mid-June storm was enough to bring
out black ants and thirsty rattlesnakes in Mexico's arid central
plains, but it didn't impress Apolonio Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   With a face as hardened and wrinkled as the land he tries to
farm, the fatalistic 76-year-old sat impassively under a mesquite
tree while rain clouds splattered the ground several miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no water, and this land is tired and doesn't want to
produce,'' Hernandez said, watching his cows pick at desert plants
sprouting from parched soil where corn would normally be planted.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Hernandez and hundreds of thousands of other
Mexicans are trapped by drought that's threatening to cripple
farming in central and northern Mexico. Five years of exceptionally
dry weather is jeopardizing everything from small plots of beans
and corn to cattle and fields of winter vegetables for export, like
tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Mexican government declared 10 states, including the
semi-desert state of Zacatecas (pronounced, ``Sa-ka-TAY-kas''),
disaster areas and earmarked $360 million in emergency funds to try
to provide feed for starving cattle and help families make it
through the year.
</P>
<P>
   Between January and April, rainfall for some parched states was
more than 90 percent below average, and average reservoir levels
have fallen to about 21 percent of their capacity in the north.
</P>
<P>
   Drought has shut down eight hydroelectric plants in Sinaloa
state, on Mexico's northwest coast. And some predictions are that
the number of cattle in Mexico could drop from 22 million just a
few months ago to 16 million because of forced early slaughtering.
</P>
<P>
   Recent showers in Zacatecas gave some farmers hope for
reasonable harvests in the fall. But in a state like this -- where
irrigation methods are woefully antiquated -- summer will be a long
stretch of anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Seasonal fear is nothing new here.
</P>
<P>
   Water problems, if not drought, are a way of life in these high
plains, where dams are few and poorly managed and 70 percent of
farmers don't even have access to wells and must rely strictly on
rain.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, bank loans for improvements are almost impossible
for most small farmers to obtain -- due to Mexico's 1994 peso
collapse and free-market reforms affecting the country's
agricultural policies, peasant associations complain.
</P>
<P>
   Modest government subsidies given to farmers who grow beans or
grains are often used to buy food or clothing, or wasted because
crops fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drought has revealed the defective agricultural system of
Mexico,'' Zacatecas' new governor, Ricardo Monreal, said in an
interview with Cox Newspapers. ``As long as the federal government
decides agriculture is not a priority, we won't advance.''
</P>
<P>
   A former member of Mexico's dominant Revolutionary Institutional
Party, or PRI, Monreal last year ran for governor under the banner
of the left-center Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD.
</P>
<P>
   The PRD and Monreal tapped into sentiment in Zacatecas that
Mexico is neglecting its small farmers, whose failure to thrive
over several generations has made Zacatecas one of the states with
the highest rate of migration to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With rain and credit both drying up, an estimated 40,000
Zacatecans left the state each year between 1990 and 1995,
according to Dario Alejandro Escobar, an agricultural economist at
the Autonomous University of Zacatecas.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two or three years of not being able to harvest, they
have to look elsewhere to feed their families,'' Escobar said,
predicting a continuing exodus toward Mexico's big industrial
cities or the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Escobar said that according to studies by the Autonomous
University of Zacatecas about 270,000 of Zacatecas' natives now
reside permanently in the United States. The state has a remaining
population of about 1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer Hernandez, who grows beans and corn about an hour north
of the capital city of Zacatecas -- without the benefit of a well
-- is a case in point. He has two sons who live in Los Angeles and
send money home to their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Monreal said he is seeking investments from abroad -- including
Europe and United States -- to try to spur industrial employment in
his state to keep its inhabitants home.
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized his former party for handing out federal farm
subsidies, accusing the PRI of using the cash as a short-term way
of buying votes and keeping small farmers loyal to the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather use that money to build dams, canals, irrigation
systems, warehouses, equipment and to help boost commercialization
of products,'' Monreal said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is powerless to change the system because the
subsidies are federally-controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Rain is scarce in Zacatecas, Monreal acknowledged, but he said
about 60 percent of it simply runs off in streams that are not
funneled into dams.
</P>
<P>
   In long valleys dotted with pines and date palms, Zacatecas has
pockets of land blessed by rich, red soil ideal for growing crops.
</P>
<P>
   But only 10 percent of land dedicated to farming is irrigated by
well water when rain is scarce. For those who have wells,
agronomists say, irrigation methods are often crude and wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   Inefficiency is also a problem -- and the butt of jokes by
farmers who have little faith in government.
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Rodriguez, 68, and his son Tomas(CQ), took advantage of
recent showers to plow their fields in anticipation of planting
beans about 60 miles north of Zacatecas.
</P>
<P>
   Their 25-acre farm, known as Ejido Cantuna, is only a few miles
from a dam built 15 years ago. But the dam was so small and
ill-conceived the Rodriguez's don't have access to it. The dam only
serves about 500 acres when at full capacity -- and now it's at
just a fraction of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the president of Mexico (Miguel de la Madrid) came to
inaugurate the dam,'' the younger Rodriguez said, ``he got really
angry when he saw how small it was. He said, 'You could have built
a bigger dam just by stacking up all the dollar bills we spent on
this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some government officials stopped by the Rodriguez's farm a few
years ago to investigate whether the Rodriguez's could get a permit
and drill a well.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials never came back. The family says it can't
afford the costs of drilling a well and pumping water anyway.
</P>
<P>
   So the Rodriguez family continues to depend on what falls from
heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``One lives always looking up at the sky, and listening to see
if the coyote barks or the rooster crows,'' said the elder
Rodriguez, only half-joking about folklore local farmers use to
forecast wet weather.

</P>
<P>
   Between January and April, rainfall for some parched states was
more than 90 percent below average, and average reservoir levels
have fallen to about 21 percent of their capacity in the north.
</P>
<P>
   Drought has shut down eight hydroelectric plants in Sinaloa
state, on Mexico's northwest coast. And some predictions are that
the number of cattle in Mexico could drop from 22 million just a
few months ago to 16 million because of forced early slaughtering.
</P>
<P>
   Recent showers in Zacatecas gave some farmers hope for
reasonable harvests in the fall. But in a state like this -- where
irrigation methods are woefully antiquated -- summer will be a long
stretch of anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Seasonal fear is nothing new here.
</P>
<P>
   Water problems, if not drought, are a way of life in these high
plains, where dams are few and poorly managed and 70 percent of
farmers don't even have access to wells and must rely strictly on
rain.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, bank loans for improvements are almost impossible
for most small farmers to obtain -- due to Mexico's 1994 peso
collapse and free-market reforms affecting the country's
agricultural policies, peasant associations complain.
</P>
<P>
   Modest government subsidies given to farmers who grow beans or
grains are often used to buy food or clothing, or wasted because
crops fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drought has revealed the defective agricultural system of
Mexico,'' Zacatecas' new governor, Ricardo Monreal, said in an
interview with Cox Newspapers. ``As long as the federal government
decides agriculture is not a priority, we won't advance.''
</P>
<P>
   A former member of Mexico's dominant Revolutionary Institutional
Party, or PRI, Monreal last year ran for governor under the banner
of the left-center Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD.
</P>
<P>
   The PRD and Monreal tapped into sentiment in Zacatecas that
Mexico is neglecting its small farmers, whose failure to thrive
over several generations has made Zacatecas one of the states with
the highest rate of migration to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With rain and credit both drying up, an estimated 40,000
Zacatecans left the state each year between 1990 and 1995,
according to Dario Alejandro Escobar, an agricultural economist at
the Autonomous University of Zacatecas.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two or three years of not being able to harvest, they
have to look elsewhere to feed their families,'' Escobar said,
predicting a continuing exodus toward Mexico's big industrial
cities or the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Escobar said that according to studies by the Autonomous
University of Zacatecas about 270,000 of Zacatecas' natives now
reside permanently in the United States. The state has a remaining
population of about 1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer Hernandez, who grows beans and corn about an hour north
of the capital city of Zacatecas -- without the benefit of a well
-- is a case in point. He has two sons who live in Los Angeles and
send money home to their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Monreal said he is seeking investments from abroad -- including
Europe and United States -- to try to spur industrial employment in
his state to keep its inhabitants home.
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized his former party for handing out federal farm
subsidies, accusing the PRI of using the cash as a short-term way
of buying votes and keeping small farmers loyal to the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather use that money to build dams, canals, irrigation
systems, warehouses, equipment and to help boost commercialization
of products,'' Monreal said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is powerless to change the system because the
subsidies are federally-controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Rain is scarce in Zacatecas, Monreal acknowledged, but he said
about 60 percent of it simply runs off in streams that are not
funneled into dams.
</P>
<P>
   In long valleys dotted with pines and date palms, Zacatecas has
pockets of land blessed by rich, red soil ideal for growing crops.
</P>
<P>
   But only 10 percent of land dedicated to farming is irrigated by
well water when rain is scarce. For those who have wells,
agronomists say, irrigation methods are often crude and wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   Inefficiency is also a problem -- and the butt of jokes by
farmers who have little faith in government.
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Rodriguez, 68, and his son Tomas(CQ), took advantage of
recent showers to plow their fields in anticipation of planting
beans about 60 miles north of Zacatecas.
</P>
<P>
   Their 25-acre farm, known as Ejido Cantuna, is only a few miles
from a dam built 15 years ago. But the dam was so small and
ill-conceived the Rodriguez's don't have access to it. The dam only
serves about 500 acres when at full capacity -- and now it's at
just a fraction of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the president of Mexico (Miguel de la Madrid) came to
inaugurate the dam,'' the younger Rodriguez said, ``he got really
angry when he saw how small it was. He said, 'You could have built
a bigger dam just by stacking up all the dollar bills we spent on
this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some government officials stopped by the Rodriguez's farm a few
years ago to investigate whether the Rodriguez's could get a permit
and drill a well.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials never came back. The family says it can't
afford the costs of drilling a well and pumping water anyway.
</P>
<P>
   So the Rodriguez family continues to depend on what falls from
heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``One lives always looking up at the sky, and listening to see
if the coyote barks or the rooster crows,'' said the elder
Rodriguez, only half-joking about folklore local farmers use to
forecast wet weather.

KIDS PROGRAM IS THE BEST SHOW NOT ON TELEVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Subs hed to correct)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ This is the best television show not on
television, a kids program that touches on religious themes but is
as cool as ``Davey and Goliath'' was not.
</P>
<P>
   The stars are a cucumber and a tomato, and issues like honesty
and trust and forgiveness and fear are broached with a style that
the makers say combines the sensibilities of Monty Python, Dr.
Seuss and Sunday school.
</P>
<P>
   I tried, but I could not come up with a better characterization.
The theme song says it best: There's never, ever, ever, ever, ever
been a show like ``VeggieTales.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever. Relying on computer animation, writing that is sharper
than most adult shows and humor far funnier than the average
sitcom, ``VeggieTales'' fills a vacuum for moral entertainment for
kids, with a keen eye toward keeping adults laughing at jokes
geared just for them.
</P>
<P>
   Available only on video (major stores and Christian outlets),
sales of half-hour ``VeggieTales'' videos exploded the past two
years, now topping 10 million overall.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, each episode can cost up to $1 million to make
and take up to six months to produce (trust us, the quality looks
it). To build up enough of a catalog to sustain a television series
will take time and tinkering.
</P>
<P>
   Computer animation (think ``Toy Story'') is more like clay
animation (``Davey'') than cell (or traditional) animation in that
the characters take on three-dimensional qualities. Artists still
draw ``key frames'' the major poses of the characters but computers
fill in the missing parts.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it this way: An artist draws A and E; the computer then
supplies the B, C and D. The results are startlingly vivid.
</P>
<P>
   The ``VeggieTales'' concept comes from Phil Vischer, founder and
chief executive of Big Idea Productions (and the voice of Bob the
Tomato) and co-creator Mike Nawrocki (voice of Larry the Cucumber).
</P>
<P>
   The two met at St. Paul Bible College in Minnesota, and were
working together at a Chicago video production house when Vischer
decided to go ahead with his dream of creating an animated
children's show founded on the Bible. Nawrocki signed on as well,
and ``VeggieTales'' was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no mention of (God) in popular children's media,''
Nawrocki said in an interview earlier this week. ``For us, it was
wanting to help kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, back around 1993 or so, distributors were
telling the pair that they loved the video, but didn't think it
would sell with the religious content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody thought it would work commercially,'' Nawrocki said.
``They said, `We love your shows, but we would love them more if
you take the God part out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thank God, and Vischer and Nawrocki, they didn't. Parents soon
realized they had a moral and entertaining alternative to the
Saturday morning fare that was benign at best and virulent at
worst.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the videos click _ there are 11 with a 12th, ``Larry
Boy and Rumor Weed,'' coming out next month _ is that while the
themes taken from the Bible are treated seriously, everything else
is played for laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Spoofs abound, including takes on ``Gilligan's Island,''
``Batman,'' ``Frankenstein,'' ``Grapes of Wrath,'' ``Tales from the
Crypt,'' ``Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' and ``Madame Bovary,''
to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both have offbeat senses of humors,'' said Nawrocki, whose
work with others on non-sequitur songs are fall-down hysterical
(``The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything'' is my favorite music video
of all time, period).
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, we like to write what makes us laugh,'' he continued.
``What we try to do with `VeggieTales' is try to identify a key
value that 4-year-olds understand. From there, we don't write humor
for kids. We write the humor for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Other adults get the joke. At the Living Word Christian Book
Store in East Greenbush, N.Y., clerk Sonia Higgins said
``VeggieTales'' tapes qualify as a best-seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are selling a lot more than other videos,'' Higgins said.
``It's skewed toward younger kids toddlers and up but we have
college kids and adults buying them.''
</P>
<P>
   And laughing at them. What do you know? A truly funny television
show. Too bad it's not on television.
</P>

PACIFICA NETWORK FINDS TURMOIL ON, OFF THE AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SELNA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ When the head of the Pacifica Radio
Foundation meets with her board of directors this weekend, she will
likely be asked to explain the battle raging at KPFA, the network
flagship station founded in 1949 on the principles of pacifism.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several months, the Berkeley station, known for
its left-of-center alternative programming, has been the scene of
street protests and arrests, a handful of potential lawsuits, radio
broadcasts used to air internal disputes, the firing of longtime
employees, and scattered gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   Pacifica is a one-of-a-kind, national network of five
listener-sponsored radio stations that receive about 85 percent of
their funding from donations. Pacifica stations are distinct from
other public stations because, among other things, they decline
corporate funding, said Carol Pierson of the National Federation of
Community Broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   Working with a small budget since its inception, KPFA has relied
on volunteers for much of its programming, and listeners have had
an informal but direct influence on its shows.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the KPFA controversy is the belief held by
veteran station employees, volunteers and listeners that Pacifica's
consensus-driven, democratic culture is falling prey to a
hierarchical bureaucracy. This bureaucracy, they say, is bent on
taking money and control away from the local stations and
potentially wresting power over what goes on the air.
</P>
<P>
   It came to a boiling point March 31, when, without the
consultation of volunteers or employees, executive director Lynn
Chadwick did not renew the contract of popular station manager
Nicole Sawaya. A KPFA news reporter, going against Chadwick's
directives, announced that decision on air. Later that night,
someone fired several gunshots at Pacifica's Berkeley offices. No
one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters condemned the dismissal and held demonstrations to
try to have their concerns heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been instances in the past where people were fired,
but it has been the culture and the practice that others were
consulted,'' said Larry Bensky, KPFA's signature voice who began
volunteering in 1969. Bensky also worked as a station manager at
KPFA in the '70s and, until recently, hosted a public affairs
program broadcast on all of Pacifica's stations. Bensky was fired
in April for an on-air denouncement of the way Sawaya's contract
was handled.
</P>
<P>
   Pacifica spokeswoman Elan Fabbri said Chadwick, who became
executive director in November, was legally prohibited from
discussing the issue. Bensky was fired, she said, because he
violated a long-standing Pacifica policy of not airing internal
disputes over the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Bensky said Chadwick's decision to let Sawaya go _ and the way
she went about it _ is the most recent example of efforts by
Pacifica to control its member stations. He said other indicators
of a power grab are Pacifica's increasing absorption of KPFA funds
and a national board decision eliminating the local boards' power
to nominate national board members.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a coalition of board members from Berkeley and from
several other Pacifica stations announced they had sent a letter to
Pacifica's board of directors and its chairwoman, Mary Francis
Berry, asserting that the board's decision broke the law.
</P>
<P>
   Fabbri said last year that the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting told Pacifica it could lose federal funding if it
continued to allow local board members to hold national seats. The
money makes up part of its annual budget of just over $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Fabbri and Bensky said that Pacifica's administrative arm now
receives about 17 percent of the foundation's funding, but could
not verify the amount that has increased in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Fabbri said a 1995 strategic plan has provisions to consolidate
the stations' administrative services and diversify programming to
make it accessible to more listeners. Fabbri said she did not know
what that would mean for programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a core group of listeners, but they are not growing,''
Fabbri said. ``If you look at the protesters, the vast majority are
over 50 and white.''
</P>
<P>
   Fabbri said that last fall, each of Pacifica's stations was
asked to conduct studies to better understand their untapped
audience potential. Without providing an explanation, Fabbri said
Sawaya refused to conduct such a study.
</P>
<P>
   Sawaya could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this refusal contributed to Sawaya's departure is
unknown, but media specialists say programming is always a
contentious issue at any radio station.
</P>
<P>
   ``The management at Pacifica wants younger listeners and more
listeners, which is understandable,'' said Ben Bagdikian, former
dean of the graduate school of journalism at the University of
California at Berkeley. ``But they (Pacifica) have gone about it in
a bureaucratic way and ignored the culture which is very local and
independent ... That is contrary to the whole culture and
philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, 14 protesters demanding reinstatement of Sawaya,
Bensky and volunteer host Robbie Osman _ who was dismissed last
week for on-air criticisms of internal decisions _ were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Protests have continued throughout the week, with vocal calls
for Chadwick's ouster, but the Berkeley police have made no further
arrests.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ It took our landlord's buddy about three
seconds to figure out why someone tried to break into our apartment
here last week, busting the lock and our composure in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Shpetim checked the broken lock, then found something I hadn't
noticed -- a small piece of wood taped to the outside of the door
above my eye line, with the name of a Serbian family printed in
pencil.
</P>
<P>
   Brash young Kosovar Albanians menacing Serbs in this downtown
building thought Serbs lived in the 10th-floor walk-up we had
rented for a couple of weeks from an ethnic Albanian family.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the Serb family on the sixth floor had succeeded at
least briefly in diverting ethnic Albanian looters -- or worse --
from their home by affixing their name to our door.
</P>
<P>
   Shpetim quickly retrieved from a drawer the brass nameplate of
the ethnic Albanian owners and hammered it back in place. The piece
of metal had lain in storage for months, taken down to divert Serb
looters -- or worse -- from attacking this apartment. It could be
restored, now that Serb thugs terrorizing Kosovo were being
replaced by ethnic Albanian thugs.
</P>
<P>
   The previous evening, after we discovered the break-in attempt,
we had been sufficiently nervous to look for help.
</P>
<P>
   NATO peacekeeping troops headquartered across the street had
pronounced repeatedly their mission to provide security for all the
people of Kosovo. That very day NATO announced it had taken over
police powers, so my colleague and I sharing this apartment figured
they could swing a patrol down our street.
</P>
<P>
   If the troops didn't care much about a couple of western
journalists, surely they would worry about Serb families we found
also had been targeted in our building. Some already were leaving.
Others were distraught with fear.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong assumption.
</P>
<P>
   It was after 7 p.m. (local time) and the media center at KFOR
headquarters, the place we journalists logically should inquire,
was locked up. A soldier who answered our insistent fists on the
door said business hours were 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. That went for the
military police headquarters, as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A concerned sentry outside the locked military police office,
where the sign said inquiries should be made after 8 the next
morning, finally succeeding in raising someone. An armed patrol of
two guys appeared on a second-floor roof, looking down in apparent
irritation at being bothered by a request for help.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs were being harassed and kicked out all over the city, one
soldier said. There was nothing NATO could do either for them or
for us, not with their limited numbers of troops. He said to drop
by the office in the morning, and a patrol MIGHT be arranged to
pass the next night.
</P>
<P>
   If we had any trouble that night, he suggested, we could just
run down the 10 floors and across the street and bang on his door
for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   If we couldn't get out past the intruders, he said, don't simply
yell 'Help' out the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shout 'Fire' or whatever the equivalent is in Albanian,''' he
advised. ``Nobody around here will answer a call for help.''
</P>
<P>
   We returned to the apartment disillusioned and understanding why
Serbs were leaving Kosovo in droves. The supposed protection by
NATO forces was a dangerous illusion at best.
</P>
<P>
   We lodged a heavy chair in front of the door and hunkered down.
There was banging on other doors, skirmishing in the hallways, but
we were not bothered again that night.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning when Shpetim and the landlord Nobel came round
they were not too surprised at the shenanigans in the building.
That's when they found the false name on our door.
</P>
<P>
   When we told Nobel that a Serb guy on the landing below had
asked for him, shaken by the Kosovar Albanians who had come to his
door with a gun and told him to get out, our young landlord quickly
went to visit the Serb.
</P>
<P>
   Milan, the Serb downstairs, had helped both Nobel and Shpetim
when Serb gunmen were on rampages through the city. He had supplied
cigarettes and food and watched the apartment. Now it was their
turn to give Milan a hand.
</P>
<P>
   When Nobel came back, it turned out Milan hadn't asked for much.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's leaving and he asked if I would keep his key. He said I
could do what I want with his apartment, and if he ever comes back
here maybe I would give back the key.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Milan came up to deliver the key. He was
dressed in blue jeans and a jeans jacket, ready for his road trip
north into Serbia where he would stay with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   He shook hands with Shpetim and Nobel, then hugged them. Before
he left, Shpetim told him to wait a minute, he had one thing he
wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   The lanky young ethnic Albanian quickly ripped a piece of paper,
wrote his own name on it, and went down to tape it to Milan's door,
in hopes it might give a little insurance against marauding by his
own people.

   Serbs were being harassed and kicked out all over the city, one
soldier said. There was nothing NATO could do either for them or
for us, not with their limited numbers of troops. He said to drop
by the office in the morning, and a patrol MIGHT be arranged to
pass the next night.
</P>
<P>
   If we had any trouble that night, he suggested, we could just
run down the 10 floors and across the street and bang on his door
for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   If we couldn't get out past the intruders, he said, don't simply
yell 'Help' out the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shout 'Fire' or whatever the equivalent is in Albanian,''' he
advised. ``Nobody around here will answer a call for help.''
</P>
<P>
   We returned to the apartment disillusioned and understanding why
Serbs were leaving Kosovo in droves. The supposed protection by
NATO forces was a dangerous illusion at best.
</P>
<P>
   We lodged a heavy chair in front of the door and hunkered down.
There was banging on other doors, skirmishing in the hallways, but
we were not bothered again that night.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning when Shpetim and the landlord Nobel came round
they were not too surprised at the shenanigans in the building.
That's when they found the false name on our door.
</P>
<P>
   When we told Nobel that a Serb guy on the landing below had
asked for him, shaken by the Kosovar Albanians who had come to his
door with a gun and told him to get out, our young landlord quickly
went to visit the Serb.
</P>
<P>
   Milan, the Serb downstairs, had helped both Nobel and Shpetim
when Serb gunmen were on rampages through the city. He had supplied
cigarettes and food and watched the apartment. Now it was their
turn to give Milan a hand.
</P>
<P>
   When Nobel came back, it turned out Milan hadn't asked for much.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's leaving and he asked if I would keep his key. He said I
could do what I want with his apartment, and if he ever comes back
here maybe I would give back the key.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Milan came up to deliver the key. He was
dressed in blue jeans and a jeans jacket, ready for his road trip
north into Serbia where he would stay with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   He shook hands with Shpetim and Nobel, then hugged them. Before
he left, Shpetim told him to wait a minute, he had one thing he
wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   The lanky young ethnic Albanian quickly ripped a piece of paper,
wrote his own name on it, and went down to tape it to Milan's door,
in hopes it might give a little insurance against marauding by his
own people.

FOR GOOD OR BAD, PRESSLER CHANGED THE FACE OF THE SOUTHERN BAPTIST
CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Houston Judge Paul Pressler, in his new book, ``A Hill on Which
to Die,'' portrays himself as one of the saviors of the national
Southern Baptist Convention. But to many, Pressler is a villain
rather than a messiah.
</P>
<P>
   He has been accused of ruthless tactics in a historic revolution
that turned the Southern Baptists far to the right in embracing
stands such as boycotting Disney, proselytizing Jews and Mormons,
and approving statements urging wives to ``submit graciously'' to
the servant leadership of their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell, who became a Southern Baptist because of
the denomination's move to conservatism, says Pressler will go down
in history as one of the heroes of the faith for saving the
convention from liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   But Pressler is the man moderates love to hate.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, released by Broadman &AMP; Holman, the Baptist
publishing arm, Pressler says he and others followed Baptist
democratic rules in ousting moderates from leadership of the 15.7
million-member denomination. And he tells of having to fight for
his conservative faith since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   He fought peer pressure from liberal students and teachers in
practicing his evangelical faith at Phillips Exeter Academy, a prep
school in New Hampshire, and at Princeton University. He says he
was ``fired'' from teaching Sunday school at Second Baptist Church
in Houston because he dared to fight liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   In a very personal note, he tells how his father, a lawyer who
became vice president of Exxon, believed that Pressler, as a youth,
had gone overboard about being ``saved'' and put some constraints
on him.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Pressler, who grew up with the country club set in
Houston, had to hitch rides to church on Sunday nights. As a
teen-ager, he was not allowed to use the family car to go to
church. But he could use the car on Sunday nights to go on dates or
to dances at the country club.
</P>
<P>
   He says his father was a Southern Baptist, devout believer and
very supportive and loving. But he distrusted preachers because of
an incident in which one of his father's former pastors had run off
with a woman in the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps opposition to my Christian faith at an early age was
training that the Lord was giving me for future trials to come,''
Pressler writes.
</P>
<P>
   Pressler also got training in denominational power brokering in
the gritty field of Texas politics. He campaigned for state
representative in 1957 and won. He was appointed to a judgeship in
1970 and served as a state appeals court judge until his retirement
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Pressler acknowledged that the conservative resurgence inflicted
pain on many moderates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret that tremendously, because my original view was that
we would work together,'' Pressler told me. ``My view was to have
parity between conservative and moderate views.''
</P>
<P>
   I can hear moderates guffawing loudly at those statements.
</P>
<P>
   Pressler said moderates, instead of agreeing to share some of
their power, widened the gulf by attacking him and other leaders of
the conservative movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most vitriolic, vicious attacks were leveled on us for
having the temerity to vote our consciences,'' Pressler said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressler became known early in the conflict for a
much-publicized statement he made about ``going for the jugular,''
meaning conservatives must find the vein controlling the lifeblood
of the national denomination.
</P>
<P>
   The ``jugular vein,'' he discovered, was determining who was
elected the convention president.
</P>
<P>
   It was little known, then. But Baptist presidents have almost
absolute power to name committees that can ultimately decide who
are named trustees of seminaries, mission boards, publishing houses
and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives began sending more voters to conventions and
electing their people as presidents. In 10 years, they were in
control. Moderates were fired or forced out of seminaries and other
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Pressler has some surprises in his book.
</P>
<P>
   Many, including myself, had given him credit for figuring out
that electing a conservative president was the key to controlling
the denomination. But Pressler writes that he got that information
from another avid conservative, the late Bill Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the criticisms, Pressler said, the conflict was worth
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of these young people now in our seminaries,'' he
said. ``So many of them would be on the garbage heap `because of
liberalism' if the conservative movement had not succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Pressler, hero or villain, always speaks his mind.

HELLO, MUDDAH, HELLO, BIG BRO: NO MORE AMMO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when it seems that the hysterical reaction to the school
shootings in Littleton, Colo., has reached an unsurpassable level
of lunacy, someone devises a reaction that is even more
preposterous than any that preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has proposed superfluous gun laws, threatened to
prosecute producers of violent movies, even demanded that schools
post the Ten Commandments to stave off outbreaks of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, of course, live and breathe for the opportunity to
overreact to a crisis. We have come to expect such idiocy from the
government, and we have learned not to overreact to the
politicians' overreactions.
</P>
<P>
   But now comes word that the private sector has joined the
hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Baltimore Sun, private summer camps for kids
are shutting down their riflery programs in response to the
nationwide furor over guns.
</P>
<P>
   Sun writer Ellen Gamerman reports that a Colorado camp operated
by the YMCA is dumping its 92-year-old shooting program for campers
_ and that similar programs are biting the dust at camps in other
states, including Maryland and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much a rite of summer camp as toasted marshmallows and
popsicle-stick birdhouses,'' Gamerman writes, ``riflery is now
under scrutiny for seeming to promote the use of guns and to
demystify their power among children.''
</P>
<P>
   The story goes on to say that most camps with riflery programs
have no plans to get rid of them, ``deeming riflery not only a
challenging target sport but also an effective way to teach gun
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``But ... a handful of conscience-stricken camp supervisors are
putting the guns away.''
</P>
<P>
   It gets better _ or worse, depending on your point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time this year,'' the Sun reports, ``Camp
Chewonki in Wiscasset, Maine, is banning any campfire songs that
mention guns.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. ``Campfire songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I don't know any campfire songs _ much less any
campfire songs that mention guns. But I'm trying to imagine what
sort of campfire song might inspire some kid to leap to his feet,
grab a rifle and start mowing down his fellow campers.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope that Rosie O'Donnell can stop berating Tom Selleck
and Charlton Heston long to enough to learn about Camp Chewonki's
heroic effort to protect America's children from the burgeoning
menace of gun-oriented campfire songs. She might want to plug _ uh,
tout _ the camp on her TV show.
</P>
<P>
   One of the YMCA honchos who calls the shots _ I mean nonshots _
at newly rifleless Camp Chief Ouray in Colorado was quoted by
Gamerman:
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought that ran through my mind was, `What if we had an
accident with a rifle, or what if some kid did turn around and
shoot a rifle at another child _ how could I justify that we had
this riflery program going on?'''
</P>
<P>
   OK, and what if some kid throws another kid in the swimming pool
and the kid drowns, or what if some kid catches pneumonia and dies
after sleeping in the woods, or what if some kid wanders off by
himself and gets crushed by a malevolent bear or some other
dangerous creature?
</P>
<P>
   Why, you could make a case for getting rid of summer camps
altogether. There's no telling what sort of terrible fate could
befall a youngster at camp.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, folks. How far will this anti-gun hysteria have to go
before reasonable people scream, ``Wait once!''
</P>
<P>
   Or something.
</P>
<P>
   I've said this before, but I'll say it again so that there is no
confusion. I'm not a gun aficionado, or even a gun owner. I have no
affiliation with the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   But this mindless anti-gun frenzy that seems to be overrunning
America worries me. It worries me not only because it threatens the
constitutional right to bear arms but because it distracts society
from the real issue in the recent epidemic of school violence: the
horrifying rage of the young people who are perpetrating the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing that the rage isn't caused by summer-camp target
shooting. I'm positive that it isn't caused by campfire songs that
mention guns.

BOURQUE RELIES ON AN OLD MENTOR FOR HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LAURENT, Quebec _ The kids come and go, by the thousands,
with their teenage triumphs and tribulations. For 32 years now,
Benoit Leduc has listened to their stories.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Ray Bourque's story was just another young man's
dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``So . . . you want to be hockey player,'' Leduc said the other
day, sitting in his office at Emile Legault High School, repeating
the conversation he had with Bourque in that same office nearly a
quarter-century earlier. ``Hmmm. You know, Raymond, you have to
work very hard to be hockey player.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, 14 years old at the time, muttered something about how
he liked to work hard, how he loved sports, all sports, but
especially hockey. He played it every day after school. He wanted
to make it someday to the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to become a hockey player, I can help you, I
think,'' said Leduc. ``But you have to listen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Five Norris Trophies later, Bourque still seeks the advice and
wisdom of his former gym teacher. He has never stopped listening.
From the time of that initial conversation, the ever-determined
Bourque has followed Leduc's advice on many subjects, above all
when it comes to Leduc's demanding off-ice workouts that have been
the underlying secret of the Bruins defenseman's success that past
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Following every hockey season, Leduc, now 51 years old, charts a
day-by-day workout routine for Bourque to follow over the summer.
After taking no more than a month off, Bourque picks up Leduc's
blueprint and takes to the road, the crux of the program a blend of
running and bike riding, rebuilding a broad base of aerobic fitness
that has kept him running longer _ and recovering faster between
shifts _ than perhaps anyone in NHL history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work with the aptitude and the attitude of the athlete,''
said Leduc, who for 14 years also was a member of the Canadian
national track and field team, coaching Team Canada's long-distance
runners. ``I work with what you have between the ears. But I am not
a god, you know? In the end, the work is up to the athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, whose career will be celebrated at Saturday's NHL draft
at the FleetCenter 20 years after he was selected No. 8 overall in
the amateur draft, skates and plays today with barely a trace of
his 38 years detectable in his game. He averaged 29.5 minutes per
game this past season, tops on the Bruins and third in the league.
In the playoffs, his average increased to 32.1 minutes, in part
because of the mind-boggling 53.26 he logged in the Game 5 OT
victory over Carolina in Round 1.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Boston, Bourque's marathon minutes and his metronomic
consistency have long been the standard of his game. He is out
there every other shift. As sure as there is traffic on the Central
Artery, there is Bourque on Causeway Street. It has been easy to
grow blase about his minutes. The puck drops on a new season and
Bourque, from Game 1 to Game 82 and beyond, plays without ever
catching the eye from Father Time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got good genes, in terms of my body, my strength,'' said
Bourque, who attended the NHL's award ceremonies Thursday night in
Toronto, once again nominated for the Norris Trophy as the league's
top blue liner. ``I think it's more will than anything _ the will
of never being satisfied and never patting yourself on the back and
saying, `You're good, you've done it now.' It's always that
thinking process that, `Hey, you haven't done enough . . . it's not
good enough . . . you have to do better . . . you've got to do
better.''
</P>
<P>
   A good measure of that attitude can be found in the annual
summer program Leduc hands his prized pupil. Bourque allows himself
one day off each week, always Sunday. For six straight days each
week, he'll run and bike the hills around his home on the North
Shore, Leduc intensifying the workout each week, adding more
sessions of high-intensity running and bike within each day's
workout. With about 10 days to go before the start of training
camp, Bourque begins to taper back slightly.
</P>
<P>
   The program, said Leduc, is designed with the idea of bringing
Bourque to peak condition and enable him to sustain his efficiency
for the duration of the protracted NHL season. The focal point is
recovery time. The aerobic base, built up over 20 years, allows the
220-pound Bourque to return to the bench after a shift and get his
wind back in a startling 45 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The workouts, said Leduc, have stretched and enlarged Bourque's
arteries and capillaries, bringing oxygenated blood to his muscles
at warp speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That recovery time, that is the difference,'' said Leduc.
``Take two athletes, one in shape, one out of shape. After one
shift they both will recover in 40 seconds. But after the next
shift, the athlete out of shape wil take 50 seconds to recover.
After three shifts, it could take him 2 1/2 or 3 minutes. But the
athlete in shape is back out there in 40 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof is in the pupil. Even with the odd strand of gray
creeping into his thick hair, Bourque springs back off the bench
with the same zip that he first showed when he arrived in the fall
of '79.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben's given me, not only in terms of workouts and training and
all that, a mental toughness _ and what it takes to compete,'' said
Bourque. ``And to go out and compete and excel and be strong. He
has a lot of wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   All these years later, Bourque and Leduc have grown to be best
pals. Bourque flew him to Nagano for the '98 Winter Olympics, when
Bourque suited up for Team Canada. Over the years, the Bruins'
captain has treated him to a number of golf outings along the
Eastern seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   In Bourque's high school days, Leduc recalled, the two would
play on a public course not far from the high school. Leduc would
hop in his car, a rusted-out '68 Rambler, and drive down the street
about a mile from the high school, where Bourque would be waiting,
sitting on the curb with his lunch in a bag. Leduc would pay the $9
that covered the greens fees for the two of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, the roles are reversed,'' said Leduc. ``Ray treats me _
and the courses are a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the nicest courses they've played, said Leduc, have been
around here, including Salem, Ipswich, and The Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We speak together in French when we're out on the course,''
said Leduc. ``And the thing about Ray is, he hasn't changed a bit
in 25 years. He'll turn to me sometimes, while were walking along
some beautiful course and he'll say, `Ben, do you believe it . . .
me and you . . . this course . . . 25 years . . . us?' ''
</P>
<P>
   When he visits Boston, Leduc stays at Bourque's house. There is
a bedroom kept for him. Uncle Ben also is Ryan Bourque's godfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he saw something in me,'' said Bourque. ``And we
connected.''
</P>
<P>
   A year from now, Leduc will be eligible for retirement from the
St. Laurent public school system. The student body has changed
considerably at Emile Legault, which rests under the low-flying
planes that make their way into nearby Dorval Airport. When Bourque
was a student there, Leduc said, the pupils were 100 percent
French-Canadian. Today, 99 percent are immigrants, representing 78
nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about retiring, I begin to choke,'' said Leduc,
looking around his office, the walls adorned with posters of
Bourque mixed in among some of the Olympic runners he has trained.
``I like my job. When I leave this office _ there are a lot of
stories here _ I'll have some tears.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does retire, Leduc would like to join an NHL team and work
with players who want to take their training seriously. The Bruins
last year sent him Jonathan Girard, their top pick in the '98
draft, and they've already seen the positive impact it has made on
his game. Ryan Milanovic, another Boston draft pick last season, is
expected to sign on with Leduc soon.
</P>
<P>
   Leduc began a track club, Regina Mundi (Queen of the World),
here about the same time he first met Bourque. He has worked with
some 800 runners at the club and, conservatively, figures he's
worked with 10,000 high schoolers in his 32 years at Emile Legault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I adopted Ray like a son, you know?'' said Leduc, who is
single and openly muses about the chance he'll one day start a
family. ``I never thought he'd be the star that he turned out to
be. But, he is an Olympian, a true NHL star. Of all the athletes
I've trained, he's the best, the most consistent athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   When the two spoke recently, Bourque told Leduc that this will
be the last summer program he'll have to design for him. Luduc has
learned to take lightly those kinds or remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was with him last summer, when he was on the program,'' said
Leduc, laughing at the recollection. ``He turned to me and he said,
`I hate you!' And I said, `What? I love you . . . and you hate me?'
He said it was the program. And I said, `Yeah, well you are 37
years old, it gets a little tougher.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The training for season No. 21 begins any day now. The Bruins
open the 1999-2000 training camp in about 10 weeks. Leduc will have
him start with some light running on Day 1, followed by a bike ride
in Day 2. He'll arrive in Wilmington, once more, the
best-conditioned athlete in camp. He'll skate in reverse faster
than some rookies, 20 years his junior, skate forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I push him to the limit,'' said Leduc. ``But you don't really
have to push Raymond. He is the horse that always wants to do more.
I tell him to run eight 200-yard sprints, and he calls to tell me
he's run nine. But that's OK, because I wanted nine _ that's why I
told him eight; I know my customer.''

BRUINS HIT LOTTERY WITH BOURQUE PICK IN '79

   _ Ray Bourque, Nov. 16, 1979 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Ray Bourque's name has been synonymous with the cream
of the National Hockey League crop since he came to Boston in 1979.
It's a given that Bourque will play 30 or more minutes a game, be
the quarterback on the power play, be the target of the opposing
team, and be the Bruins' best player. For 20 years, that's been as
consistent as the sun rising in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   He is a sports rarity; he has always been a Bruin and he has
declared that he will always be a Bruin. But there was a time when
there was a chance he might have been something else _ a budding
legend in another uniform. Hard to fathom, yes, but true.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, the league was in transition, folding four World Hockey
Association teams into the NHL. The newcomers were Quebec City,
Hartford, Edmonton, and Winnipeg and the minimum draft age was
lowered from 19 to 18.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in recent years, there was no hoopla, no podium, no live
TV coverage, no cross-continent press junkets when Bourque was
taken that year with the No. 8 pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all done by phone,'' said Bourque, who will be honored
Saturday for the 20th anniversary of his draft year. ``I remember I
was teaching a hockey school in the afternoon and being called off
the ice, where I had a call from my agent saying I was drafted
eighth overall by the Bruins. Then I got the call from Bruins
management and then I talked to the press on the phone. We didn't
get to step up to the podium and have your name announced in front
of the full building. But it was nice.''
</P>
<P>
   The year before, Boston had dealt Ron Grahame to Los Angeles for
the Kings' pick, which wound up being Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles general manager Dave Taylor, who played 17 years for
the Kings (1977-94), could have been a Bourque teammate. ``Who's to
say that we would have picked Ray Bourque?'' said Taylor. ``But it
was a great pick by the Bruins . . . and all the credit should go
to Ray Bourque. He should have gone No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   In any other year, it's likely he would have, but
president/general manager Harry Sinden said that teams picking
before Boston opted for the more experienced WHA players such as
defenseman Rob Ramage, who was taken with the No. 1 pick overall by
Colorado. The other defensemen taken before Bourque were Craig
Hartsburg, now the Anaheim Mighty Ducks coach who was grabbed by
Minnesota with the No. 6 pick, and Keith Brown, who was taken by
Chicago at No. 7. The Bruins had interest in Brown, too, but once
he was gone, Bourque was the only player Boston considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had him rated seventh and not because he was the seventh
best player,'' said Sinden of the man who now holds the Bruins'
all-time scoring record. ``But we felt (other teams) would go for
these WHA guys. We thought Raymond should be rated No. 7 and we had
the No. 8 pick and therefore we thought we'd probably have to take
Brown. But Chicago took Brown and Bourque ended up going eighth. We
had Keith Brown right there but there would've been a huge argument
at the table, and I think (head scout) Gary Darling would've won
out because he was a Ray Bourque guy. That's what I remember about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike today's draft setup, Bourque said he didn't interview
with a dozen or so teams. The only hint he had that the Bruins
wanted him was a call from Darling saying the club had interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't really say much more than that,'' said Bourque.
``That's the way it worked out. I didn't care where or which round.
I kind of knew I was going to go in the first round and probably
the first half of the first round, but I didn't know where or to
who. I didn't really care.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Bourque was rooting for his hometown Canadiens
against the Bruins during the second round of the playoffs in 1979.
The Habs wound up winning the Cup in five games over the New York
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the Bruins lose to Montreal in overtime of the
seventh game and I remember going by the Forum that night and kind
of giving it (a fist pump), yelling, `Yes, sir!' '' said Bourque.
``I was cheering for Montreal. A few months later, I was going to
Boston. It was kind of weird there was such a rivalry there. I was
going to the bad guys but a lot of people left Montreal with me
that day and became Bruins fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Darling, now in the real estate business in Peterborough,
Ontario, said it was clear early on that Bourque was special.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a young racehorse, all ready to win the Kentucky
Derby or the Triple Crown,'' said Darling. ``He was a free-wheeling
skater with great hockey sense and great puck sense. He could turn
on a dime and had a good heavy shot. He was very agile at that
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Darling said he spoke to Chicago's scouting staff the night
before the draft in an effort to detect whom the Blackhawks were
planning to take at No. 7, but he said the club wouldn't tip its
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted Ray Bourque but we didn't know if he was going to
last or not,'' said Darling. ``It was fortunate for the Bruins that
he was available.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Darling was very high on Bourque from watching him play
with his junior team in Verdun of the Quebec League, he said there
was no way to predict just how remarkable a career Bourque would
have.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy who plays 20 years in the league has got to be a
racehorse and he is a horse,'' said Darling. ``This is what you
hope for when you draft them, that they will be a star and they
will play for your club their whole career. I don't know when the
last time this has happened. It makes you feel proud that you could
draft someone like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Craig Hartsburg was a pretty good hockey player, Rob Ramage
was a good player, Mike Gartner. That was a pretty good draft. Ray
was by far the best talent that was available at No. 8. We liked
Keith Brown, too, don't ask me who we were going to take.'' When it
came time to negotiate a contract, Sinden said he was put in an
unusual predicament. The late Rodrig Lemoyne, owner and coach of
Bourque's Verdun junior team, was Bourque's agent, and when he and
Sinden met at the Montreal airport to talk about a deal, Sinden was
stunned at Lemoyne's tack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a prosecuting attorney or district attorney in Sorel,''
said Sinden. ``He bragged about how he handled murderers and
rapists and not to fool with him. It was really strange. When we
got to talking contract with him, it was more than a veiled threat
to me that unless he could get the contract he wanted, I'd better
keep my eyes open as I walked around Montreal. I said, `Well, I
have friends here, too, and if you break my legs, I'm going to have
to have yours broken and now we've both got broken legs and the kid
doesn't have a contract. I knew his reputation by that time. He'd
been around a rough crowd and he was a little strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque said Lemoyne, while unconventional, wasn't all bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't always stick to the book when it came down to
negotiations, obviously,'' said Bourque. ``But in other ways, I
knew him a lot more than maybe some other people and he had another
side to him. As controversial as he was, he was a troubled man.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said he is grateful for his association with Bourque over
the past 20 years, not only for Bourque's Hall-of-Fame caliber
career but for his off-ice class and leadership that is rare not
only in pro sports but in life. In that fateful fall of 1979, when
Bourque first started, Sinden said he had a hint of just what was
to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I saw him at a Bruins' practice at training
camp, I knew we had something special, I knew it,'' said Sinden.
``I didn't know it was going to be this special, 20 years of
excellence, but I knew he was a special player. Having done it so
long and so well, that in itself separates him from almost anybody.
That he was a Norris Trophy finalist at 38 makes him one of the
most incredible players the league has ever had.''

find a treasure trove of dinosaur bones. And those old fossils
could bolster his theory that two-footed carnivores traveled in
groups, with fleet youngsters driving prey into the powerful jaws
of waiting adults.

   Ice covers roughly 8 percent of the globe and is one of the most
familiar substances, yet it continues to confound scientists.
Unlike other liquids, water expands rather than contracts as it
freezes. And under pressure ice melts rather than solidifying
further like other substances. Writer Richard Woodley reports on
this mysterious, complex stuff that's hard to study.

IN BOSNIA, A LESSON FOR KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina _ In a region of strange
intersections, the crossroads of Krtolji surely is one of the most
bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   Huge, horse-drawn haywagons compete for space on the roads with
air-conditioned busloads of Italian carabinieri on their way to
patrol duty. Farmers labor with 18th-century tools as passenger
aircraft and jet fighters zoom overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Off in one direction from the crossroads, the people of Sarajevo
work and live in an area that is part of the Federation of Bosnia
and Herzegovina, a nation-within-the-nation of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, where most citizens are Muslims or Croats. Off the
other way, former Sarajevans peddle pirated software at the gateway
to Republika Srpska, a separate nation-within-the-nation where
almost everyone is Serb.
</P>
<P>
   Among modest cinderblock-and-tile houses being rebuilt by
Muslims here and Serbs there, construction teams are raising a
huge, ultramodern barracks complex for the United Nations
stabilization force for Bosnia, a mute but convincing testament to
the conviction of 37 participating governments that they will be
trying to keep the peace in this shattered land for a long, long
time.
</P>
<P>
   This is the topsy-turvy world of Bosnia under the Dayton
accords, the peace agreement that, in 1995, ended the worst
European war of the last half-century. The agreement's shortcomings
provide a sobering preview of what lies ahead for the United States
and NATO in Kosovo if would-be peacemakers continue to equivocate
about disarming the Kosovo Liberation Army and controlling the
province's Serb minority the way they waffled and shied away from
hard decisions in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   There is an inherent contradiction between a multiethnic society
and an ethnically divided one, said Albert Rohan, secretary general
of the Austrian foreign ministry and a highly experienced diplomat
in the Balkans. The attempt of Dayton negotiators to have it both
ways, to create a state built around the rights of ethnic groups
but still guaranteeing Western-style individual rights, made Dayton
a document that cannot be implemented, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious problem in the law,'' said Vildana Helic, a
judge in the city of Tuzla and president of the League of Women
Voters of Bosnia and Herzegovina. ``Why would a Serb choose to be a
minority in the federation'' rather than a majority in Republika
Srpska? ``Why would a Croat or Muslim choose to be a minority in
Republika Srpska'' rather than a majority in the federation?
</P>
<P>
   The result is that there has been almost no progress toward the
goal of reestablishing a multicultural, multiethnic state.
</P>
<P>
   Judged by the goal of stopping 3 1/2 years of slaughter, the
accords are a clear success; Bosnia, said Jacques Klein, the
French-American soldier-diplomat who oversees Dayton implementation
as second in command in the Office of the High Representative,
``has a lower level of violence than many countries in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   But by any other standard, success is hard to claim.
</P>
<P>
   --Returning refugees and internally displaced people to their
original homes was supposed to be a primary goal, and throughout
the region there is widespread sentiment in support of this goal.
But almost all the refugees who have come back to Bosnia have
settled into communities in which they are in the ethnic majority;
those who lived in communities where they were minorities generally
are staying away.
</P>
<P>
   --Evolution of a unified central government, with participation
by Muslims, Serbs, and Croats, was another top priority. But the
central government hardly functions and the tripartite presidency,
as one military source put it, ``only meets when it's told to (by
foreign administrators) to meet foreign dignitaries.'' Republika
Srpska functions as an independent country, and in the rest of the
country Muslims and Croats, mostly Roman Catholics, are at one
another's throats.
</P>
<P>
   --Reconciliation among the peoples is no more than a concept on
paper. With the exception of some courageous nongovernmental
organizations, such as the League of Women Voters, national social
and political organizations do not exist. Dialogue among the ethnic
groups ranges from cool to cold.
</P>
<P>
   However, said Jakob Finci, head of the Soros Foundation's Open
Society Fund, which is promoting development of democracy and civic
institutions in Bosnia, ``there is no Holy Bible for this country
but the Dayton peace accord. Without Dayton, there is no Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some notable developments that look like steps
forward: adoption of a new flag and national anthem that are not
identified with any ethnic group; a fully convertible national
currency pegged to the German mark; and new license plates that do
not identify which entity a car is from _ or, by implication, the
ethnicity of its owner.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, none of these steps were arrived at through
deliberations among the leaders of the Serbs, Muslims, and Croats.
Instead, the leaders objected and delayed until the issues were
resolved by the Office of the High Representative.
</P>
<P>
   Finci, a Jew, and one of a very few people able to run relief
supplies into Sarajevo during the siege of 1992-95, reflects the
confusion of many when he both embraces Dayton yet wonders at the
nature of an agreement that precludes him from running for high
office because he is not Serb, Muslim, or Croat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not so foolish as to run,'' he said, ``but what is the
human rights meaning of this? It is absolutely contradictory to all
the human rights resolutions and declarations. . . . It was just
the only way to have peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayton stopped the violence but did not end the war, said Klein,
asserting that the agreement in certain ways ``empowered the
warlords'' by creating a system in which most people are encouraged
to vote along ethnic lines. Many Bosnians also note that there has
been relatively little change within the ethnic groups from the
leadership that took them into war.
</P>
<P>
   The problems with Dayton are practical as well as conceptual.
Although roughly 31,000 troops from about three dozen nations are
in the United Nations-sanctioned, NATO-led peacekeeping force, in
general their commanders have shied away from aggressive pursuit of
indicted war criminals and other operations that could lead to
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   As long as an indicted war criminal like former Bosnia Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic remains free, ``it displays the impotence
of the international community,'' Klein said. ``It says, what can
you do? What is your authority?''
</P>
<P>
   He lashes out at what he sees as an overemphasis on avoiding
casualties, saying the international forces ``are professionals,
well trained and well equipped, and you expect to take losses. If
you aren't willing to take losses, you can't do the job and
shouldn't accept the assignment.''
</P>
<P>
   Swanee Hunt, who became deeply involved in Bosnian issues during
her tenure as US ambassador to Austria, calls the failure to
apprehend the war criminals inexcusable, and says it is a major
reason people do not return to their homes in areas where their
ethnic groups are minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not safe,'' Hunt said. ``We have indicted war criminals
who are still on the police forces, or running around as
rabble-rousers.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are serious problems which cannot be
attributed to flaws in the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Europeans pledged $20 billion to rebuild
the country, but only $5 billion ever came in, according to the
Office of the High Representative. Now, governments and
nongovernmental relief agencies alike are starting to turn their
attention to Kosovo and Serbia, where more recent fighting has
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Also, here, as in Croatia, domestic politicians and foreigners
alike may have been mistaken in their approach to privatizing
businesses and housing, both of which were largely state-owned in
the communist era that preceeded the Balkan wars.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all these problems, there are some hopeful signs. Many
here say the recent NATO bombardment of Serbia over the expulsion
of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo is a plus, likely to make residents
of Republika Srpska happier about being part of Bosnia than an
appendage of a devastated Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the attitude of young people like Peda Skopljak,
25, one of the Serbs selling computer programs and music on CD
Alley, as the pirated software zone at the Krtolji entrance to
Republika Srpska is known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I go to Sarajevo, and relax, and look in the
beautiful shops,'' he said. ``Right after the war, I thought that
was impossible. Today it is normal. I worried at first how my
friends would react, but everything was normal. . . . We are all
aware we didn't wish for this war. Nobody asked us.''
</P>
<P>
   Finci, however, warns that ``some politicians think (the Dayton
era) is just a cease-fire, and that when it is over they will
finish the war.''

AFTER CURE, TOLHURST IN `PROPER MODE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lol Tolhurst spent more than a decade as a rock star. He was the
co-founder, with Robert Smith, of the angsty new wave dance band
the Cure. They rose from cultdom and clubs to selling millions of
records and packing arenas. For Tolhurst, a
drummer-turned-keyboardist, that ended in 1989, when his former
pal, Smith, sacked him for excessive substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   You want motivation? Here's motivation. ``Part of the reason I'm
doing this,'' says Tolhurst, who has put together a new group,
Levinhurst with his wife, Cindy Levinson, ``is I want to prove to
the people who hate me that I'm still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Tolhurst sued Smith and the Cure after his ousting, but he now
says, they ``were pretty justified because I was pretty out of it.
Without trying to justify what I did I think people kind of expect
musicians to stare into the abyss for them an unfortunately I fell
into it for a while. I had a little time afterward to reflect and I
thought I'd go and see if there was a way to sort things out. I was
finding out myself that I was at the wrong end of the bottle and a
lot of other things, too. I checked into rehab, the same place that
Eric Clapton went to - at least there's a little musical
pedigree.''
</P>
<P>
   Tolhurst re-entered the music scene in the early '90s, forming a
band called Presence, which had little. The group recorded two
albums, released one and did not make a mark. Looking back,
Tolhurst says he came back too quickly _ ``my psyche or my soul
wasn't repaired enough by that point.'' After Presence, Tolhurst
tinkered with ``bits and pieces,'' did some low level
soundtracking.
</P>
<P>
   Levinhurst came together almost by accident. Tolhurst, who lives
in Los Angeles, was introduced to his future wife by a friend. ``As
we got further into the relationship,'' Tolhurst says, ``music
became one of the main driving forces. I guess I heard her singing
in the shower or in the garden and thought `There is something very
powerful there.' I don't look a gift horse in the mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Levinhurst has recorded a six-song CD, which they'll sell at
shows. Tolhurst explains what to expect at shows: ``The show is in
three parts, what happened then, and what it's like now. We're
remixing some of the old Cure songs, then there's a half hour of
Levinhurst material and then a half hour of current stuff. At this
stage, it's just me and Cindy, with (former Cure drummer) Andy
Anderson, who's waiting for his visa to come through. The set-up is
this: The whole thing is sequenced and I play little lines here and
there. It's pretty electronic at this stage, but there's structure
and hopefully it holds a little melody. It reminds me of how I
started with the Cure, the do-it-yourself punk thing. This is the
real deal. This is me back in the proper mode.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHERE HE HANGS HIS HAT IS HIS HOME: Dr. John, the Night Tripper,
is a roadhog, playing upwards of 250 gigs a year, tossing out his
New Orleans-deep-fried funk and hoodoo magic. He enjoys his nomadic
life, but says, ``I never have expectations about anything; I've
beeen in this racket too long to have any expectations.'' Which
sounds either cynical or practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little of both,'' says Dr. John. ``Getting to the gigs
can be a nighmare, but the gigs, when we play, we always have a
good time. That's what our job is, we get paid to have a good time
and we take a lot of pride in making people get up and dance.''
</P>
<P>
   But the good doctor can do more than that. He contributed key
parts to the English space-rock band Spiritualized's ``Ladies and
Gentleman, We are Floating in Space'' album. Just as a lot of the
veteran musicians took the young Dr. John under their wing as a
session man early in his career _ the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan,
Van Morrison _ he enjoys the role of older statesman playing with
younger, different bands. ``I like all kinds of music,'' he says.
``They called me up about doing the session. They sent me a tape, I
thought it would be different from what the end result was'' but
that's part of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John, like George W. Bush, 'fesses up to youthful
indiscretions _ ``I had a lot of legal and illiegal things going as
a teeenager'' _ and beat a heroin addiction ten years ago. Did the
drugs feed the music, did the music feed the drugs? ``I didn't have
a lot of time to reflect on that. You go where life takes you. I
chose a few paths that were probably not the best moves, but when
you're younger you make some rebellious, foolhardy maneuvers, drugs
and other things that go with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grammy-winning Dr. John, whose latest album is ``Anutha
Zone,'' calls his group Lower 911, 911 standing for the emergency
police number and Lower 9 standing for a particularly notorious
area of Louisiana. The show starts at noon. Also on the bill are
Entrain, Boogaloo Swamis, Fat City, the Shods, Dell and Exit In.
Tix are $12. It all takes place on the North Lawn behind the Tsongs
Arena on the banks of the Merrimack River.

USE MORTAR TO FILL GARAGE WALL HOLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 27, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The plastered walls of my basement garage have holes, and I
would like to plug them. The plaster doesn't look like plaster, but
a rougher finish, and I can see metal lath behind the holes. How
can I fill them?
</P>
<P>
   JOE REARDON, Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Those walls are mortar, basically concrete, set on the wire
lath. This is necessary to make the walls between garage and living
space or basement fire resistant, required by code.
</P>
<P>
   Fill the holes with Mortar Mix, a ready-mixed Sakrete product
(just add water) sold in hardware and building stores. If the metal
lath behind the holes is intact, press in the mortar; it will ooze
through the lath for a good hold. If there is no wire lath visible,
install hardware cloth, a quarter-inch steel mesh that will hold
the mortar equally well. If there is a stud behind the hole, nail
the hardware cloth to the stud. If there is no stud, jam the
hardware cloth into the hole, about halfway into its depth. To make
the new mortar match the wall finish, rub it with a wood board
after it begins to set up, usually in about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Mike Brooks of Marlborough, Mass. called to ask why a
pressure-relief valve failed each time he installed one on his new
water heater, the handyman suggested he have a pro install it, then
blame the pro if it fails.
</P>
<P>
   The correct answer was to have a pro install a valve, but Joe
Green of Chelmsford, Mass., a plumbing inspector for three towns,
took exception to the rather facetious remark about blaming the pro
if it fails.
</P>
<P>
   Green added some reasons why the valve failed: If it is
dribbling, it may be due to too high a water pressure. If that
happens, install a pressure-reducing valve on the water inlet,
right at the meter. If the valve goes off like a shot, the water is
too hot, said Green. If that is the case, you should replace or
repair the gas valve, if it is a gas-fired unit, to control the
heat. If it is electric, the energy source should be fixed or
replaced, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Good point, Joe Green, and the handyman has placed your name and
phone number in his files for future reference. And, installation
of valves and water heaters should be done by a professional. But
let's not blame anyone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I countersunk the fasteners on my deck boards. Some are shiny
and some are not, giving everything an uneven look. Will a sealer
or stain even out that shininess? The countersunk holes are 3/8
inch in diameter. Some of the wood is discolored. Will a
semitransparent stain cover the wood evenly?
</P>
<P>
   BILL FITZGERALD, Taunton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. A sealer or semitransparent stain will dull the fasteners,
but not for long. Your best bet is to fill the 3/8-inch holes with
dowels, then stain the whole deck. Tap a 3/8-inch dowel into each
hole and cut it off with a flexible saw, such as a Japanese saw
that will cut the dowel off flush with the deck without serious
scratching.
</P>
<P>
   As for the stain covering the discolored wood, it depends on
what the discoloration is. If the wood is weathered, the stain will
cover fairly evenly. If the discoloration is mildew, the mildew
will grow right through the stain, making things even worse. If it
is mildew, wash the deck with a solution of one part household
bleach and three parts water. Let dry, then rinse and let dry
before you stain. Wear skin and eye protection when working with
bleach.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My three aluminum storm doors have jalousie windows. The
metal was spray painted brown, but now the brown is wearing off and
the brown is discolored. How can I repaint them? Are there any
companies that do this?
</P>
<P>
   ELEANOR McMANUS, Hyde Park, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It's too bad the doors were painted, because painting
aluminum doors is always iffy. And, if a dark color is put over a
light color, or vice versa, if the new paint fails it will look
terrible because of the high contrast bewteen the two colors. But
to repaint, sand the finish as thoroughly as necesary to remove any
loose paint, roughen the finish and reduce gloss. Wash with paint
thinner. Then apply an oil-based primer and finish up with a spray
enamel. There are also companies who might be able to do it, too;
at least they do appliances and tile. Find one in the Yellow Pages
under ``Appliances _ Household Refinishing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My pressure-treated deck was installed eight years ago. The
installer said there was no need to treat it. He was right; it is
still in good shape. So why do so many sealer makers recommend
putting a clear sealer on it?
</P>
<P>
   JEAN MELANSON, Melrose, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Because they want to sell sealer. Well, that is not quite
fair, because sealer is recommended to make the wood
water-resistant to prevent splitting, splintering, and cracking of
the wood. Pressure-treated wood is green; that is, full of water,
and when it dries out and shrinks, it tends to split, splinter and
crack.
</P>
<P>
   I think you lucked out on your deck; the wood might have been
dry when it was installed, so it resisted cracking and splintering.

KNICKS GUARD TRYING TO WARD OFF CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one has taken more abuse during the NBA Finals than Knicks
guard Charlie Ward.
</P>
<P>
   OK. Maybe Larry Johnson. But he brings most of it on himself.
</P>
<P>
   Ward is different. As NBC's Bob Costas rightly points out, no
one questions Ward's athletic ability. He won the 1993 Heisman
Trophy as quarterback of Florida State, and the New York Yankees
and Milwaukee Brewers were interested in him. But he chose
basketball, and before the beginning of this season, he committed
himself to the sport for the long run, signing a five-year, $30
million deal with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Costas raises the right question about Ward,
asking, ``Is he an NBA point guard?''
</P>
<P>
   During the first quarter of Game 4 against the Spurs Wednesday
night, Ward played like one. After the guard hit a surprising
3-pointer, Costas quipped, ``Ward has done next to nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Next thing anyone knew, Ward was, as analyst Doug Collins said,
``feeling it.'' Even Costas had to grudgingly acknowledge Ward's
play, saying, ``What's up with Charlie Ward tonight? He's a new man
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins pointed out that Ward was taking advantage of a matchup
that forced aging Steve Kerr to guard him. Ward was such a force
that Collins questioned why coach Jeff Van Gundy played injured
guard Chris Childs throughout the majority of the second quarter.
``Ward is playing really well, and I wouldn't let him sit out too
long,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Ward reentered the game with about four minutes remaining in the
quarter. He finished the half with 10 points, three steals, two
assists, and, most important, no turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Isiah Thomas gave Ward a little respect during NBC's halftime
report, saying he had enrgeized his team with his scoring and
defensive play. ``Ward is keeping the Knicks involved,'' Thomas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Walton wouldn't have any of it. A long-standing critic of
Ward, Walton dismissed Ward's performance, saying that for $30
million the team deserves as much. ``How about my man Charlie
Ward?'' Walton joked. ``Thirty million dollars, a couple of buckets
in a half of a half, PLEASE.''
</P>
<P>
   The real reason that the Knicks had remained close, Walton
argued, was that Spurs guard Avery Johnson and center David
Robinson had been on the bench for a significant portion of the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Ward soon would prove Walton right. He had a chance to tie the
game late in the fourth quarter with two free throws, but he made
only one. He then committed a turnover when the Knicks were trying
to stage a comeback. After going 4 for 4 in the first half, he
missed all five of his second-half shots.
</P>
<P>
   At least Ward is a decent guy. Unlike Johnson, who has been
abused by Tim Duncan throughout the series, Ward knows enough to
shut up and let his play do the talking.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad he doesn't have much to talk about.

TWO US VETERANS RECALL MASSACRE DURING KOREAN WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAEGWAN, South Korea _ Forty-nine years ago, Pvt. Frederick M.
Ryan and 41 other American prisoners of war were gunned down on a
Korean hillside, their hands tied behind their backs, and left for
dead.
</P>
<P>
   A priest with the American unit that found the men kissed the
wounded Ryan's forehead, administered last rites and draped a cross
and a Purple Heart around his neck. But even though Ryan's side had
been shattered by five bullets, he was one of five soldiers who
miraculously survived the Aug. 17, 1949 massacre, their bodies
shielded by those of their dead buddies.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Ryan returned to Hill 303 _ a strategic vantage point
that changed hands at least seven times _ to find the massacre site
and to say goodbye to the ghosts of the past. Friday (June 25), on
the 49th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War, Ryan and
his fellow troops from a mortar platoon of the Army's 1st Cavalry
Division are being recognized for their sacrifice, half a century
late _ thanks to an amateur military historian from New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to say goodbye to my friends. Their bodies might not
be there, but their spirits are,'' said Ryan, 67, a retired railway
conductor, mechanic and gas station attendant from Cincinnati. ``If
I could, I'd bring them back in a minute, ``but they died that day
cussing out the other side. . .and I know they'd die again just as
they did for peace in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1950-53 Korean conflict is often called the ``forgotten
war,'' and the massacre of American POWs at Hill 303 is one of many
largely-forgotten incidents from the chaotic early months when
communist troops pushed South Korean and United Nations forces into
a 100-mile by 50-mile tip of the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   There was never a full accounting of what happened here, nor a
recognition of all the POWs. All these decades, the five survivors
themselves did not know how many had made it out alive.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Army Capt. David Kangas of Greenville, N.H., a graduate of
Fitchburg State College, who heard about the mass execution in 1985
when he was posted at Camp Carroll, where the 1st Cavalry was
based. Kangas asked around the base, and then at the Korean War
Museum in town, and found that no one knew anything about it. The
few historical accounts were sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   So he launched a ``needle-in-a-haystack'' search through
historical accounts, contemporary news reports and the National
Archives, hoping to find clues. The massacre had prompted Gen.
Douglas MacArthur to drop leaflets over North Korean territory
warning that soldiers would be held accountable for war crimes. But
it was all but forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I finally found the area of the execution site, I said,
`Someday, I will find the survivors _ someday.' It was an act of
faith,'' recalled Kangas, 42.
</P>
<P>
   Official records of the massacre were incomplete. Ryan, for one,
was declared dead at the hill, and those accounts were never
corrected when the 18-year-old recruit recovered. A government
documents building in St. Louis burned down in the 1960s, taking
records of that day with it. The unknown survivors, never knew how
to correct the record, or even that they could. It was Kangas, once
he found the men, who launched a personal campaign to get them
recognized for POW benefits and medals.
</P>
<P>
   But first, he had to find them. Nearly a decade after Kangas
began his search, another war history enthusiast read an interview
with him in a New Jersey newspaper and linked him up with Ryan and
the two other remaining survivors, re-uniting the men for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me Fred was dead. They told me I was the sole
survivor,'' said former Pfc. Roy Manring, 67, a retired maintenance
worker from New Albany, Ind. who drove several hours to Ryan's
house in Ohio the day he learned his friend was alive.
</P>
<P>
   Manring was shot 13 times and spent 18 months in hospitals in
Korea, Japan and the United States. ``I tried to forget about it. .
. I didn't want to talk to anyone about it except my wife. My kids
knew I was an ex-POW, but they didn't know what I had been
through.''
</P>
<P>
   The time for forgetting ended when Manring met up again with
Ryan and former Pvt. James M. Rudd of Salyerville, Ky. First they
were awarded the POW medal and other honors. This year, they were
invited and sponsored by South Korean veterans and US soldiers at
Camp Carroll to come back to identify the massacre site for a
memorial. Rudd was too ill to make the journey. Ryan, who fears
flying, had vowed never to board a plane again after leaving Korea
_ except if it was to come back.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan and Manring spent the day trudging around the forgotten
hillside, now covered with vineyards and partly dug up for a tunnel
under construction. After hours in the sun, pouring water over
themselves and comparing the much-changed terrain to their memories
of mortar emplacements and lookout points, Manring froze, fell to
his knees on a rock and said he knew this was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was laying right here after they shot me,'' he said with a
shudder. His grandfather appeared to him and ``put his arm on my
shoulder and said, `They're coming back, get out of here.''' When
Manring struggled up, he was shot five more times by an approaching
American unit that couldn't identify his ragged uniform. The
victims had been 15 minutes shy of being saved.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre was the culmination of three days of captivity for
67 Americans, Manring and Ryan say, during which the North Koreans
tied them together and moved them constantly. The first night, 10
of the POWs were taken away with shovels _ presumably to dig their
own graves _ and never returned. A few escaped overnight, but the
second day, when one soldier slipped on the hillside and briefly
separated from the others, the angry captors decapitated him with a
trench-digging tool.
</P>
<P>
   After taking some minutes by himself in the gulley, Manring
whispered, ``I talked to the boys. I hope I'm at peace now. I
begged their forgiveness. I have dreams about them all the time. I
feel guilty that I survived.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, trying to locate the spot where he was shot, recalled
being shielded by the body of a 6-foot-3, 280-pound fellow soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as the North Koreans turned around, I shook the guy on
top of me, but he didn't respond. Then I got up and lifted my
friend Hernandez. He told me to get down, they were coming back. I
didn't talk to him 30 seconds before he died in my arms, and I
started crying,'' Ryan remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said he stayed alive by thinking of his mother, his
girlfriend, and the chocolate malts at his favorite soda shop in
his hometown of Dayton, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   The emotion of being in the spot where he almost died finally
overcame Manring. ``I'm going to tell you something I've hardly
told anyone,'' he began softly. ``I shot a little Korean girl _ she
was maybe 8 or 10 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Manring recounted that his platoon was approached one day by a
group of refugees, but when he took out his binoculars, he saw a
girl holding a grenade in her hands, and no pin in it, headed their
way. Before she had a chance to throw it, ``I put a bullet in
between her eyes,'' he said, sobbing. ``She bothers me to this day.
. . I've got a half-Korean granddaughter, and when she gets hurt,
it always brings that back to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When Manring and his platoon ran over to the group, killed by
the girl's exploded grenade, 12 of the 16 had Communist North
Korean uniforms on under their civilian clothes, he said.

OVERDRIVE ECONOMY GIVES FEW A CHANCE TO SLOW DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Through the open cabin door, John Goodhue can spy a sparkling
wedge of Purity Lake. Just out of sight, his 8-year-old son paddles
in a canoe near shore.
</P>
<P>
   This would be an idyllic summer scene _ save one small matter:
Goodhue is on the telephone with a coworker about a presentation
he's giving the next day at work. ``I promised it was going to be
an hour, and it was two,'' Goodhue says sheepishly about the call
on a recent Sunday afternoon from a New Hampshire resort he visited
with his wife and son.
</P>
<P>
   Goodhue, as chief engineer of a Chelmsford, Mass. unit of Cisco
Systems, is a busy man, and he has lots of company.
</P>
<P>
   With the United States well into its eighth year of a boisterous
expansion, demands placed on workers by their customers, clients,
and coworkers are unrelenting as the economy barrels along, month
after month.
</P>
<P>
   While economists crow about the rising productivity of US
workers, workplace experts say that many people are working harder
as well as longer hours. The arrival of summer has brought little
relief from the hectic pace of life at work.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Americans, in the view of other cultures, have
always been ``overworked.'' Italy has its lunch feasts; Mexico, its
siestas.
</P>
<P>
   But, there may be some new truth in Americans' longstanding
reputation. With US unemployment at a 29-year low of 4.2 percent _
Massachusetts' rate is an even lower 3.1 percent _ employers cannot
find enough people to handle all the work coming in the door.
Employees are being asked to do more _ often they are expected to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to find workers. Labor is scarce and expensive.
People are working harder,'' said David Wyss, chief economist for
Standard &AMP; Poor's/DRI, a Lexington, Mass. consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Few begrudge a heavier workload, which is far better than being
unemployed. And a booming economy creates new opportunities,
promotions, and higher pay for those able to take advantage of it.
Yet, professionals interviewed for this article said they are being
called on to squeeze more into a single day's work.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Baressi describes her job as a juggling act.
</P>
<P>
   As marketing director for Shuster Laboratories, which tests
products for consumer-goods companies, ``I'm juggling multiple
marketing events, multiple direct mailings, multiple strategic
plans,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Baressi was so busy on a recent Tuesday morning that she walked
around Shuster's Quincy, Mass. office for at least an hour before
another executive discreetly mentioned the mint-green dress she had
worn to work was on backward. Despite the stresses of work, Baressi
can't ignore the opportunities presented by a strong economy, which
helped boost revenue by nearly a third last year at Shuster, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Colorado-based Hauser Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big opportunity out there,'' she said, and ``you
have to do the work to get the business.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, a tight labor market should give workers more _ not
less _ clout with employers. But Lena Lundgren, director of the
Center on Work and Family at Boston University, said employees who
are asked to work late or to do more work have ``difficulty saying
`no.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the economy is strong, many retain a mindset adopted
when times were bad, and they were afraid of losing their jobs, she
said. ``It's very difficult to move away from that,'' Lundgren
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jayne Burke works a 10-hour day as partner and consultant for
PricewaterhouseCoopers _ her days are much longer when she is
traveling to see the firm's clients scattered all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said that it sometimes seems everyone _ her clients,
coworkers and herself _ are ``trying to do more than one job.''
Because clients face extreme time pressures, this, in turn,
``forces me to be extra efficient. Everybody's pace is extremely
high right now.''
</P>
<P>
   James Erb, whose carpentry crew was renovating a house in
Cambridge, Mass. last week, can tell you all about that.
</P>
<P>
   Erb said he regrettably turned down a handful of jobs during the
past month _ he's been unable to find skilled workers to increase
the size of his crew. To keep up with the jobs he does take on, Erb
and his four employees are in overdrive. ``We work eight hours but
in that eight hours, we're actually getting nine or 10 hours of
work done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have a word for accomplishing more in a set period of
time: productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity of US workers _ the amount of goods workers produce
for each hour of work _ surged 2.6 percent during the year ended
March 1999. That's a sharp rise from a 1 percent gain in
productivity in 1997. Through the 1980s, productivity growth
averaged less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is a major force pushing up productivity in recent
years, economists say. With personal computers and high-speed
equipment on the factory floor, employees are empowered to
accomplish more at work.
</P>
<P>
   But while productivity is way up, the government statistics do
not accurately measure the productivity of many white-collar
professionals. That's because government statistics assume that
salaried workers put in the same 41.8-hour week as do workers paid
by the hour. About one-fourth of the US work force is in salaried
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If salaried workers are putting in a lot more overtime, that
gives you an artificial boost to productivity,'' Wyss said.
</P>
<P>
   Workplace experts say surveys of salaried managers clearly show
that they are working more than a 40-hour week _ and would like to
reduce their time at work. Kathleen Christensen, a research
director for the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in New York who
specializes in work-family issues, said a study sponsored by her
organization found that well-educated professionals and managers
``increasingly are at risk of working 50-plus hours'' but are
compensated for only 40 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, both men and women executives and managers seem to view
the eight-hour day as a quaint convention, one that is unrealistic.
That is true especially in fast-growing companies, such as i-Cube,
a Cambridge consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Madden, an i-Cube vice president, said a 10-hour day is
``standard.'' She added, ``Sometimes it's 12. Sometimes it's
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, technology, which is credited with boosting productivity,
can create a longer day for executives _ both at the office and
away from it.
</P>
<P>
   Laptop computers free executives to travel more _ they can take
their office with them. Cell phones and voice mail mean the phone
calls and messages stream in, nonstop, when they are in meetings
and continue at night, on weekends, and on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Goodhue travels nearly every week for his employer. During a
typical week in June, Goodhue caught a 7:30 a.m. flight from Logan
Intrernational Airport and arrived, midmorning, in San Jose,
Calif., Cisco System's headquarters. When he returned to Boston, he
spent the night in own bed but took off the next morning for Nova
Scotia to visit a customer there. He returned on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   When he's on the road, a laptop computer and briefcase are his
office. He answers e-mail while in flight and listens to phone
messages when driving to the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always looking for dead time where I couldn't be doing
anything else,'' he says. ``That's where I try to fit in the extra
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Thelma Sullivan can tell you all about fitting in the extra
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   For the publisher of The Black Pages, a directory of African
American-owned businesses in New England, a strong economy is a
mixed blessing. While advertising revenues are up 20 percent in two
years, Sullivan has had no luck in her search for two qualified
people to hire. To cope, she said, ``My day has to be really
structured to get more done.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's work days spill into evenings and Saturdays. Sundays,
her day of rest, are where she draws the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything not done on Saturdays,'' Sullivan said, ``can wait
until Mondays.''

BALANCED PORTFOLIO CONTAINS GROWTH AND INCOME ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 27, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 66 years old and my wife is 63. We are both retired. Our
combined Social Security is $1,295 a month and my pension provides
a further $1,033. In addition to these sources of income, I
withdraw $500 a month from our other investments. We have a total
of $142,000 in IRA accounts, mostly invested in stock mutual funds,
and $384,232 in taxable investments, all in individual stocks
except a $94,000 CD and $10,000 in a money market fund. My goal is
to be able to withdraw $10,000 a year for living expenses, without
touching the principal. How would you allocate these investments?
Should I start withdrawing from my IRA?
</P>
<P>
   C.G., Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The way I like to see a retirement portfolio set up to
provide an income stream is to create two distinct segments of the
portfolio -- one for growth and the other for the income. Your
example is quite tidy, since if all of your various IRA holdings
were consolidated into a fixed-income portfolio, it might provide a
$9,230 annual income stream, presuming a 6.5 percent average
portfolio yield. If you simply withdrew the yield from such a
portfolio, you could make up the differences through withdrawals
from the money market fund on the taxable side of the portfolio.
The effect would be that you'd have $274,232, or a little more than
half of your savings, remaining in stocks -- sufficient to protect
you against the likely effect of inflation during the latter years
of your retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Most mutual fund families offer funds in the categories I'd
suggest, which is roughly a quarter in either a money market fund
or a short-term corporate bond fund, 50 percent in a GNMA or
government securities fund, and the final quarter in a high-yield
(or ``junk'') bond fund.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, it would probably be best to sell some of
your individual stock holdings to establish the fixed-income fund,
but the Internal Revenue Service codes have gone a long way to
render this world imperfect. Thus I would make all of the sales
within the IRAs, where there will be no short-term tax effect. This
will have the side effect of reducing your portfolio
diversification, since your stock market exposure will be in the 12
blue chip stocks you now hold. So I would slowly correct this by
reinvesting all of the dividends from the stocks in a mutual funds,
beginning with a Standard and Poor's 500 Index fund such as
Fidelity Spartan Market Index or Vanguard Index 500, and once that
position is solidly established, broadening out into more diverse
holdings such as you currently hold in the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there others like myself, aged 73, who might bee
interested in a safe parking place for funds from the sale of a
home, in the range of $125,000 to $150,000. I have been out of the
market since 1988, having been burned during the period from 1965
to 1980 when the stock market slumped, and I am not interested in
entering it at the high end. How about Fidelity Government
Securities? Municipal bonds? I don't want to risk the money, which,
along with a 401(k) account, is earmarked for my children and
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A. Fidelity Government Securities fund changed its name to
Fidelity Government Income last fall. Although it's been having
some tough sledding recently, it has a solid enough long-term
record. So rather than focus on its scant 1.49 percent 12-month
total return, or its 3.13 percent year-to-date loss, you might
consider the longer records -- an average annual total return of
6.55 percent over the past five years, and an 8.15 percent record
over a decade. Reflecting the tough recent results, it has been
downgraded from above-average to average by Morningstar Mutual
Funds, which posts its current yield at 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The decision whether to go with that fund, municipal bonds, or a
municipal bond fund, will probably be largely controlled by your
overall tax situation. All of the yield from Fidelity Government
Income is subject to federal income tax. Because income from
government securities is not taxable in Massachusetts, part of the
yield from this fund is free of Massachusetts taxes. The people at
Fidelity told me that last year 44.93 percent of the income from
the fund was thus free of state taxes last year. (The balance of
the portfolio is in issues such as GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC, which are
instrumentalities of the government, but do not quality for the
Massachusetts tax exemption.)
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to take the tax-free route, Fidelity Massachusetts
Municipal Income fund, free of both state and federal taxes, looks
attractive, with a current yield of 4.8 percent. Morningstar
credits it with above-average performance. Its comparable figures
for total return are a negative 1.03 percent year-to-date, 2.19
percent for one year, 6,59 percent for three years, 6.30 percent
for five years, and 7.40 percent over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 64-year-old single woman who will retire in June of
2000. My Social Security will approximate $1,105 a month and a
company pension will add an additional $2,258 per month. If
possible, I would like an annual income of $60,000 to $65,000 in
retirement. I am wondering if my portfolio is properly diversified
and whether I should be making any allocation changes. In
tax-deferred accounts, I have $396,637 in large-cap stock funds,
$15,728 in Vanguard Health Care fund, $611,409 in US Treasuries,
and $202,452 in Vanguard Short-Term Bond fund. In taxable accounts,
I have $19,695 in Vanguard Index 500, $172,934 in CDs and money
market funds, and $15,187 in Fidelity Dividend Growth fund.
</P>
<P>
   N.B., Tyngsborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Obviously you are in very good shape. From my point of view,
the portfolio may be a bit too conservative, with only 31.2 percent
of it in stocks, and all but the Vanguard Health Care fund in
large-cap diversified stock funds. But my point of view may not be
yours, and if this is all the risk you want to bear, that's fine;
the idea in retirement is to have a good time, and you've laid up
sufficient funds to do so without worrying about money even if you
stick with this.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if I were you I would divert about $100,000 from the
Vanguard Short-Term Bond fund, using it to buy another $10,000
worth of Vanguard Health Care, and to establish equal $30,000
positions in Vanguard Short-Term Index, Vanguard Mid-Term Index,
and Vanguard International Growth funds.
</P>
<P>
   If you're uncomfortable with the idea of moving more money into
the current stock market -- and that strikes me as a pretty
reasonable position right now -- I have an alternative suggestion.
According to my estimates, your income from the fixed-income side
of your portfolio will combine with your pension and Social
Security to provide you with a little more than $85,000 annual
income. (This figure may be a bit high, since I presumed an average
return of 6.5 percent from the fixed-income side, which may be
optimistic.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the more cautious path would be to begin a
dollar-cost-averaging program once you retire, moving about $1,666
a month from your excess income into a portfolio of mutual funds
designed to give you the same kind of diversification that I
suggested above. As you probably know, this dollar-cost averaging
discipline shelters you from some of the shock that can materialize
if an investor moves a lump sum of money into stocks right before a
market downturn. You could also speed this process if you used any
distributions from your current stock funds to build the smaller
fund positions.
</P>
<P>
   But at bottom, I'm really as concerned about the diversification
as I am with the relatively small percentage of the portfolio
that's in stocks. You have probably heard the old saw that a
person's fixed-income portfolio measured as a percentage of the
whole should equal her age. That's fair enough as a very general
rule, but the better-feathered your nest is, the more stocks you
can afford to hold, and I think that 40 percent is a far better
figure for you than 31 percent -- and I'd think the same if you
were a decade older.

PUT IT OUT, CIGAR JOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Professional sports commissioners should read upscale cigar
magazines to know why they should crack down on the glamorizing of
smoking by athletes and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   In a feature about pitcher Orlando Hernandez and last year's
World Series celebration of the New York Yankees, Cigar Aficionado
wrote, ``The clubhouse turned into a geyser of champagne and a
thick cloud of smoke. . . . With so much good fortune packed into a
10-month period, one can understand Hernandez's reasons for
celebrating _ and smoking _ more.''
</P>
<P>
   In a feature about hockey great Wayne Gretzky, when he was still
an active player, Cigar Aficionado wrote: ``Can Gretzky light up at
the Official All-Star Cafe in Times Square? `Sure, you can smoke
there,' he says. `They don't have a problem with that.' Being a
part owner helps. He recently brought his teammates to see a tape
of the Holyfield-Tyson fight after hours and the smoke was probably
as thick as a curtain that night.''
</P>
<P>
   The thick curtains have their cost. Recentlt The New England
Journal of Medicine published a study indicating that cigar
smoking, while not as damaging as cigarette smoking, still doubles
the risk of lung, throat, and mouth cancers and elevates the risk
of heart disease. The study said cigar smoke is curtains whether it
is inhaled directly or breathed in from the ``clouds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cigar smoke contains the same toxic and carcinogenic compounds
that are found in cigarette smoke,'' the study said. ``Another
potential reason why cigar smoking may increase the risk of
coronary heart disease is the associated high levels of exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke. Even cigar smokers who do not inhale
are exposed to their own environmental tobacco smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Jocks are still in the clouds, seeing cigars as a balm for
competitive lives. Gretzky said, ``I smoke with the guys: it's a
chance to relax.'' Baseball's Bobby Bonilla said, ``I smoke on my
way to the ballpark. When I'm smoking is when I'm most relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mean Joe Greene, the Hall of Fame football lineman and coach,
said, ``Cigars are my escape from stress. When I'm smoking, it's a
delicious moment, like watching the ocean, enjoying some soft
jazz.'' Golfing great Tom Watson said of cigars, ``I enjoy them the
most when I'm outdoors, walking the raw land, and watching a dog go
to point when I'm quail hunting. Then you're at peace, free.''
</P>
<P>
   Cigars even get indirect credit for athletic performance. Cigar
Aficionado wrote that the passion for cigars of golfer Davis Love
III helped to ``diversify his life.'' Golfer and cigar-buddy Brad
Faxon said: ``I think he's a better player since he's taken on all
these things in life. I mean, I don't think he's a better player
because he smokes cigars, but he's a better player for getting his
mind off the game and avoiding burnout.''
</P>
<P>
   Cigars have become a new source of peer pressure. Asked by Cigar
Aficionado if any nonsmokers on the Chicago Bulls ever complained
about the clouds on team buses from the smoke of Michael Jordan,
ex-teammate and broadcaster John Salley said, ``We were just
apostles. Jesus was smoking, that's all there is to it. Jesus is in
the back of the bus smoking, so you don't say jack. Jesus and 11
apostles. What are you going to say?''
</P>
<P>
   Then Bulls coach Phil Jackson rationalized cigars by citing
Native Americans. ``Smoking cigars still retains a communal aspect
where a circle of friends can ruminate about the day, digest a
shared meal, and talk about their hopes and dreams,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners should ruminate on this: All that hocus-pocus
might appear to work for athletes in the prime of their fitness,
but in actuality the typical cigar smoker, according to the study,
is fatter and has higher blood pressure, higher levels of
cholesterol, and is more likely to have diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The denial of cigar-smoking athletes is embodied in Ahmad
Rashad, the ex-football player and four-to-five-a-day cigar smoker
who hooks young fans on basketball on ``NBA Inside Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   His daughter has called him on his own stuff. When he saw his
doctor for a cough, the doctor asked Rashad if he smoked. ``I say,
Yeah, I smoke one or two a day,'' Rashad said. ``And my daughter
cuts in and says, `Dad, you smoke more than one or a two a day.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sports leagues should cut in to say cut it out. Cigarette
billboards are now banned from stadiums. Athletes would now be
castigated if they glamorized cigarettes in interviews. Jocks
should likewise not be used to peddle cigars to impressionable
fans, especially when physical fitness is declining and cigar
smoking is increasing. Cigar smoking has risen mostly among the
wealthy but has also increased among teens and women.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the clouds of glamour, the extolling by athletes of the
communal and solitary pleasures of cigars is no less silly than
claiming the bumming of cigarettes outside office buildings in
January to be a warm, relaxing ritual. Contrary to Mean Joe Greene,
this moment of cigar smoking is not delicious. It is dangerous.

FORMER LABOR SECRETARY QUIETLY CONSIDERS RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS AND SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After four years locked, if not quite gagged, in the cabinet of
a centrist president, Bob Reich has broken free to reclaim his
progressive credentials.
</P>
<P>
   But can one of the left's leading policy intellectuals make the
transition from an appointed post to elective politics?
</P>
<P>
   The former secretary of labor is wondering just that as he
quietly talks to advisers and friends about running for governor of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Reich tries to downplay his interest, although he admits he's
giving the idea some thought. ``I am on the fringes, sniffing
around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But others who have spoken with him are more definite.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more than seriously thinking about it,'' said one
Democratic activist who has talked with Reich about his political
ambitions. ``He'd love to run, but he's smart enough to know that
he has to assess whether it's at all viable.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a good and interesting question.
</P>
<P>
   For all his celebrity, the obstacles are formidable. For
starters, superficial though it may be, Reich, 53, is strikingly
short, standing only 4 feet 10 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Second, and perhaps most damaging in a heated political
campaign, he stands accused of fabricating events in his memoirs to
bolster his image.
</P>
<P>
   And though his progressive share-the-wealth message would surely
gladden liberal hearts, it may be out of touch with the cautious
politics of a prosperous era. Further, he has no built-in
constituency or base to launch a race.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Reich is acting like a man laying the groundwork for a
campaign. He is showing up increasingly as the featured speaker at
events where political figures are seen and heard: a teacher's
rally at the State House; a talk at Rosie's Place.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, his recent, well-covered address to a graduation
ceremony at the Pine Street Inn settlement house in Boston captured
the spotlight. Reich basked in media coverage that contrasted his
remarks with the Harvard commencement speech on the same day by
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the billing couldn't have been better: the cautious
conservative capitalist credited with creating the current economic
boom versus the progressive champion who argues the country's vast
wealth is increasingly maldistributed.
</P>
<P>
   He is also quietly meeting with political consultants, studying
the politial side of the game, posing questions about running for
public office in Massachusetts, and showing a keen interest in the
campaign process.
</P>
<P>
   How keen? Well, in May, Reich, who teaches at Brandeis
University, convened several politically savvy friends at his home
to discuss a potential race. One good piece of advice he is
getting: Get to know Massachusetts, not necessarily geographically
but rather its constituencies, its special-interest groups, and its
political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   One key question: Could Reich raise the table stakes a
Massachusetts governor's race usually requires?
</P>
<P>
   If funded, the state's nascent system of publicly financed
elections could help. ``But you can't count on that, so he has to
have a contingency plan,'' said one friend who has discussed a
campaign with Reich.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the issue of campaign niche.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Reich may be a celebrity, but Massachusetts Senate
President Thomas F. Birmingham would have a strong claim on many of
the progressive constituencies Reich would hope to tap,
particularly in the labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a Reich candidacy would add an interesting dynamic to a
2002 Democratic primary. Smart, crisp, and articulate, Reich is
media savy and can communicate well. He demonstrated that when he
used a relatively obscure cabinet post to become one of the
highest-profile Clinton appointees.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps just as importantly, as an author and thinker Reich
has developed a coherent world view that stands in stark
distinction to the me-too centrism of many Massachusetts Democrats.
His economic message _ namely that the country's prosperity has
enriched only those with assets and that the underclass and working
class are not better off _ would resonate well in the liberal wings
of the state party.
</P>
<P>
   His politics are hardly cautious. While most progressives
advocate raising the minimum wage to help those struggling at the
margins, Reich goes far further. He calls on the Wall Street
winners to finance services for those left behind. In exchange for
the programs that are benefiting them, ``the winners must agree to
apply a portion of their added booty to equipping the losers,'' he
wrote in a recent article in American Prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Is that too radical for modern, middle-of-the-road
Massachusetts? Reich admits that's a concern.
</P>
<P>
   There are other problems as well.
</P>
<P>
   Although it shouldn't matter, Reich is so short it colors
people's perceptions. And like it or not, physical stature does
count considerably in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Friends acknowledge the concern, but note that over the years
Reich has developed a knack for putting people at ease. As labor
secretary, for example, he was fond of starting an address to
business audiences by peering over the podium to ask: ``Now tell
me, do I really look like Big Government to you?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a more difficult hurdle for Reich would be dealing with
the firestorm he created in 1997 with his book ``Locked in the
Cabinet,'' a memoir of his four years as labor secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Reich was accused of fabricating the details and dialogue in
depicted events that make him look good. A C-Span tape contradicted
his description of his confrontation with a Republican senator at a
Senate hearing. Former AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland angrily
denounced him for what he said was fabrication of the events at a
union gathering. A Democratic congressman said Reich had made up a
quote attributed to him.
</P>
<P>
   If Reich runs, that issue would surely be revisited.
</P>
<P>
   The former secretary has an explanation: the frailty of memory.
``Memory is powerful,'' Reich explained. For the paperback edition,
all the errors were corrected, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the humor he uses to defuse the height issue is lacking
when it comes to his book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics tends to be a gotcha game,'' he complained. ``The
trick in politics is to keep people focused on the issues _ but I
am not sure that is possible anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bob Reich runs, that will be his challenge.

   MILFORD, Mass. _ Nancy DeLuzio may get a cake to celebrate her
82nd birthday Friday (June 25). In fact, she could even buy the
bakery.
</P>
<P>
   The lifelong Milford resident, who hit a $3.1 million jackpot
Monday while playing a 50-cent slot machine in Atlantic City, N.J.,
is still recovering from the excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing,'' she said Thursday, as she sat at the kitchen
table in her small, second-floor apartment. ``I thought I just won
about $1,000, but then the security guard came over and said, `You
just became an instant millionaire.' And I started to shake.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLuzio, who sold homemade macaroni for 20 years as a way of
staying active after her husband died in 1973, spent about $30 in
the Fabulous 50's slot machine at the Claridge Casino Hotel and was
about to slide over to try her luck at another machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something said to just play three more times,'' she said, as
flowers, candy, and photos taken after her big win covered her
table.
</P>
<P>
   DeLuzio will receive $160,000 annually for 19 years. She cashed
her first check Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after she won, fellow gamblers and casino executives
swarmed around DeLuzio to congratulate her. Smiling, DeLuzio
Thursday recalled one man's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy came up to me and said, `Mother, at last I found
you,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and neighbors gathered at DeLuzio's apartment Monday
night when she returned in a chaufferred limousine provided by the
casino _ a far cry from the tour bus she and three friends had
taken down to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fanfare after hitting the big money, DeLuzio
remained unfazed, said Glenn Lillie, a hotel spokesman, adding that
it was the largest slot machine jackpot in the casino's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was as centered and genuine as anyone I've ever seen,'' he
said. ``She was funny and vibrant. This is one time that a good
soul won.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLuzio said her first priority as a new millionaire would be to
replace her wardrobe. She also promised to take good care of her
family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever they want, they can have,'' she said. ``I'm willing
to share.'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Packard, DeLuzio's daughter, said she's thrilled her
mother will have no financial worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a good person, and she deserves every happiness from
this.'' her daughter said.
</P>
<P>
   Packard had been planning a surprise party for her mother's
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a small dinner party planned, and now we don't know
what we are going to do,'' Packard said. ``It might expand.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLuzio, an occassional gambler who last fed slots at a casino
last December, plans to hire an acountant for financial advice. But
fun will be at the top of her list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to take this day by day,'' she said. ``Whatever I
want to do, I am going to do.''

EXPECTED RATE HIKE DRAWS POLITICAL INTEREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What is the most effective federal social program?
Some economists say it is not college tuition grants or housing
subsidies. Instead, they point to the low interest rates set by
Alan Greenspan and other Federal Reserve policymakers.
</P>
<P>
   Low rates have encouraged businesses to add millions of new
jobs, pulling more minorities and low-income Americans into the
work force. Businesses, competing hard for workers, have had to
raise wages. In short, these economists say, low interest rates
have been the best medicine for the most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But now, this program could be repealed. And a vocal minority is
complaining.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Fed policy-makers are likely to raise interest rates
in a ``pre-emptive strike'' against inflation. Greenspan all but
announced the rate hike in congressional testimony last week, and
investors are convinced he will follow through. Fear of higher
rates caused the Dow Jones industrial average to tumble 132.03
points Thursday, or 1.24 percent, to 10,534.83.
</P>
<P>
   Because higher rates cause businesses to lay off workers, a key
question hangs over next week's Fed meeting. Which is the greater
evil: Putting some Americans out of work in order to ward off
inflation, or letting everyone work at the risk that inflation will
rise and hurt the whole economy?
</P>
<P>
   Keep Americans working, Democratic lawmakers and minority and
labor leaders said at a press conference Thursday. There just
aren't enough signs of inflation to warrant any job losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most recent consumer price index numbers show zero
inflation _ zero,'' said John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO.
The mere ``fear of inflation,'' he said, should not cause anyone to
lose a job.
</P>
<P>
   Until only recently, said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat
of Newton, the nation's prosperity has excluded low-income
Americans. It would be ``tragic, wrong morally, wrong economically
. . . to now try to slow down the expansion, just when people who
are the victims of the economy become its beneficiaries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While a rising tide lifts all boats, for those boats stuck in
the mud, the tide must be allowed to rise longer,'' said Kweisi
Mfume, president of the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the rate hike, however, are fighting some long-held
economic notions. Most prominent is that the Fed should move
against inflation at the earliest sign of its appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed does not have to wait until the consumer price index
rises, argued Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the economics department
at Princeton University and co-author of a book on central bank
battles against inflation. ``If they see inflation based on futures
prices or any other indicator, they should act now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another notion is that the Fed cannot hesitate to raise rates
when the market expects such a move, or it will lose its
``credibility'' as an inflation-fighter. When investors believe
that the Fed is on guard against inflation, they are willing to buy
bonds that pay low interest rates, and rates stay low across the
board. When they fear the Fed is weak on inflation, they panic and
demand high bond rates.
</P>
<P>
   Most controversial is the idea that the nation cannot enjoy low
inflation and low unemployment at the same time, that allowing
everyone to work will inevitably cause prices to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional theory holds that when unemployment falls below 5
percent or 6 percent, businesses have to raise wages to attract
workers. Then they have to raise prices to cover the higher wage
bill. The result is inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said as much last week. ``Should labor markets
continue to tighten, significant increases in wages . . . will
inevitably emerge, absent the unlikely repeal of the law of supply
and demand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the vocal minority says this is not true. After all, Sweeney
said, unemployment dipped below 6 percent, then 5.5 percent, and
even below 4.5 percent, and there are no clear signs of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   High inflation is caused by wars and ``external shocks'' like
the oil crisis of the 1970s, said James Galbraith, a University of
Texas economist, in a phone interview. ``The notion that we live in
a world in which inflation is an ever-present threat _ that you
always have to be standing in a door with a crowbar to clobber it
on the head _ is contrary to fact,'' Galbraith said.
</P>
<P>
   Galbraith has long argued that low interest rates are crucial
for helping low-income Americans close the wage gap with wealthier
workers. In a series of research papers, he has showed a
correlation between unemployment and income inequality.
</P>
<P>
   When unemployment rises, low-income people lose their jobs or
accept lower wages, and the gap with wealthier Americans increases,
Galbraith says. When unemployment falls, lower-income workers make
up economic ground, and the gap between rich and poor becomes
smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key factor here is stability,'' he said. With a long
expansion, people remain in their jobs longer, earn higher wages
and qualify for credit. They can buy more goods and obtain
mortgages. A range of social good follows, from lower crime rates
to smaller welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Many other economists, however, say low-income Americans also
run a risk of losing their jobs if the Fed allows inflation to
creep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two worst recessions of recent times _ 1973 to 1975 and
1981 to 1982 _ were brought about by the Fed having to crack down
on the economy because inflation was out of the bottle,'' Bernanke
said. ``If inflation gets out of control, then you get recession _
and that's what really hurts low-income people.''
</P>
<P>
   In setting rates, Greenspan and his colleagues look at more than
unemployment levels. They look at the stock market, which the Fed
chairman has suggested is trading at unreasonably high rates, and
at the global economy, which appears to have pulled back from
dangerous downturn. They also look at a range of more esoteric
measures, which reportedly include railroad freight-car loadings
and the lag-time in filling industrial orders.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after cutting rates last fall amid the global economic
crisis, Greenspan seems ready to don his inflation-fighting gear
again. ``When we can be preemptive, we should be,'' he told
lawmakes last week, ``because modest preemptive actions can obviate
the need for more drastic actions'' later on.
</P>
<P>
   But Fed critics say there is no pressing reasons to take such
action now. ``High employment and fair wages are not threats but
assets to the economy,'' said Representative Bruce Vento, Democrat
of Minnesota. ``The ivory tower that economists live in bears
little resemblance to Main Street USA. I urge chairman Greenspan to
take a long, hard look at the people this academic exercise would
harm.''

SUMMER FICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Today I'm soliciting nominations for what I hope will become
an annual award, The Simon C. Fireman Medal for Chutzpah.
</P>
<P>
   Be warned, the judges will be incredibly selective. All nominees
will be measured against the extraordinary example set by our
local-boy-turned-felon in his just-published memoir, ``No Justice,
The 6 Million Dollar Disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Fireman, you'll recall, is famed for paying the largest fine
ever levied in a campaign finance case. Fireman's attempt to be a
GOP moneybags to the Dole campaign in 1996 backfired, costing him a
$6 million fine and six months of home confinement.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-year-old Fireman's incredible explanation: It was my
secretary's fault. It was my lawyer's fault. And for good measure,
the judge ``despised'' me.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that. And the judge hadn't even read this book, yet.
Think how I feel after wading through this muck.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Justice'' is the most whine you'll get in 244 pages on any
summer reading list. Some of the best slop is right up front when
Fireman recounts the hard time he served in his Marina Bay condo
with a monitoring bracelet strapped to his ankle. He could have
visitors only three times a week. His phone calls were monitored.
On his twice-a-day walks he couldn't ``stop at my favorite cafe for
a warm-up cup of coffee,'' even on a cold day.
</P>
<P>
   My personal favorite: ``And the bracelet denied my wife, Norma,
and me such simple spousal pleasures as the ability to roll over on
a foggy Sunday morning and intertwine legs and ankles while waking
up and watching the sun light the landscape outside the window.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider, Simon, who you could have been interwining legs and
ankles with at Cedar Junction, where you might have wound up.
</P>
<P>
   Fireman spends pages and pages blaming his troubles on his
former private assistant, Carol Nichols. Although he was the boss,
it was Nichols who wrote the thousand-dollar checks, all $120,000
of them, Fireman says. He was duped _ duped! _ by this woman he
treated like family. Why he didn't even know the color of the
company checkbook!
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor Carol,'' as he calls her. She's a single girl,
``tremendously hard working, but she was not a particularly
sophisticated or worldly person.'' Why, she came from ``modest
circumstances and is not a college graduate. She didn't have much
of a life outside the office,'' says the man known for hosting
$5,000-a-plate Republican fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Why, why would she do such a thing? ``I was afraid Carol had
gotten a little carried away by the glamour of it all and with her
own misguided vision of herself as more of a player than she really
was.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge had a different take. US Judge William G. Young gave
Nichols a $7,500 fine, which she paid off in monthly installments.
Young told Nichols: ``I understand you got your orders from him
(Fireman) . . . In a very real way I believe you were just
following orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Fireman has also sued his former lawyer, Thomas Dwyer, for
malpractice and makes one of the city's best-known criminal
attorneys the alternative fall guy in the book. Dwyer, Fireman
tells us, ``was good at the con,'' and used ``scare tactics'' to
badger him into going along with a guilty verdict. Among Fireman's
many zings: ``Tommy Dwyer has come to a realization in midlife that
he's a lousy courtroom lawyer and didn't have the courage or
confidence to stand up before a Judge Young in open court and wage
battle over complex legal and financial issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But he told a very different story at his sentencing. Asked
repeatedly by the judge, Fireman said his lawyers had explained the
charges ``in great detail.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge: ``Are you satisfied with the representation that they
have given you?''
</P>
<P>
   Fireman: ``Yes sir.''
</P>
<P>
   All's well that ends well, I suppose. In ``Exonerated,'' his
final chapter, Fireman tells us of his amazement that day in May
1997 that a letter arrived from the Federal Election Commission,
saying the agency would not be pursuing a case against him. He had
been cleared!
</P>
<P>
   Cleared, I asked Fireman on the phone Thursday? Yes, he said.
But, no, the government hadn't returned $6 million, either.

<P>
   JOURNAL-KOSOVO _ PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ It took our landlord's
buddy about three seconds to figure out why someone tried to break
into our apartment last week, busting the lock and our composure in
the process. Shpetim checked the broken lock, then found something
I hadn't noticed _ a small piece of wood taped to the outside of
the door above my eye line, with the name of a Serbian family
printed in pencil. The previous evening, after we discovered the
break-in attempt, we had been sufficiently nervous to look for
help. NATO troops headquartered across the street had pronounced
repeatedly their mission to provide security for all the people of
Kosovo. That very day NATO announced it had taken over police
powers, so my colleague and I sharing this apartment figured they
could swing a patrol down our street. If the troops didn't care
much about a couple of western journalists, surely they would worry
about Serbian families we found also had been targeted in our
building. Some already were leaving. Others were distraught with
fear. Wrong assumption. (Kunstel, Cox News Service).

   Demise of Divx Clears the Field
</P>
<P>
   However the collapse last week of Divx, the alternative digital
video disk, affects the spread of DVD, it at least relieves
confusion for consumers and perhaps increases the inclination of
studios and other distributors to commit more films to a new medium
that several months ago seemed to be getting tangled in a format
war.
</P>
<P>
   Divx, developed by Circuit City, the consumer-electronics chain,
was predicated on a marketing concept that made it incompatible
with standard DVD and required a different player. (Basically, the
Divx disk was designed to play once, whereupon, among other
options, the user could throw it away rather than return it to the
video store.)
</P>
<P>
   By late winter Divx was accounting for about 10 percent of the
overall DVD market. Nevertheless, Circuit City, citing high costs,
difficulty in getting movies for the format and distribution
problems, announced on June 16 that it was discontinuing the line.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of standard DVD stopped short of performing back flips,
but the Divx withdrawal disarms a situation that in its first
stages had disquieting intimations of video's VHS-Beta conflict of
the early 80's. Now the consumer no longer has to choose one form
of DVD over another, and that pleases the movie makers and
distributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be more aggressive in changing all our VHS titles into
the DVD format,'' said Amir Malin, president of Artisan
Entertainment, an independent film and video company with a library
of 6,600 films, among them titles like ``Dirty Dancing,''
``Reservoir Dogs'' and ``Terminator 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Malin, a strong supporter of the standard disk, said the removal
of Divx positions DVD to replace videotape and the VCR eventually.
That remains to be seen, of course, but with DVD now in more than
two million households, one can at least agree with his observation
that it has overcome another format that had the misfortune of
competing against the VCR. ``Until now,'' Malin said, ``there was
always the issue of whether DVD was going to be the technology of
the future or another format like laser disk: high-end use and
limited availability.''
</P>
<P>
   Truffaut for the Home
</P>
<P>
   Thursday a two-month Francois Truffaut retrospective ended at
Film Forum in Manhattan, but videophiles should be aware that six
of the films are available in restored editions, on both tape and
DVD, from Fox Lorber, the distributor that provided the movies for
the Film Forum series. They are ``The 400 Blows,'' ``Shoot the
Piano Player,'' ``The Last Metro,'' ``Confidentially Yours,''
``Love on the Run'' and ``Two English Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 24 seven more Truffauts will appear on tape and disk:
``Jules and Jim,'' ``The Soft Skin,'' ``The Woman Next Door,''
``Bed and Board,'' ``Stolen Kisses'' and two short films on one
cassette, ``Les Mistons'' and ``Antoine and Colette.''
</P>
<P>
   All the videos have been made from new prints and have newly
translated subtitles.

   The Thin Red Line
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from James Jones' Guadalcanal novel, Terrence Malick's
film, his first in two decades, skirts the nuts and bolts of
warfare to contemplate mankind's self-destructiveness, the unity of
soldiers, the destruction of nature and the emptiness of victory.
Despite a starry cast that includes Sean Penn (above), Woody
Harrelson and Nick Nolte, personalities and events tend to fade
into indistinctness, which will disappoint anyone in search of a
plot. But Malick's visual genius and lush Edenic images are, Janet
Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``a visceral reminder of all
that made his past work so hauntingly majestic, even if this
movie's difficulties will soon announce themselves with equal
clarity.''

   West Canaan High School exists for football under the hard-nosed
tutelage of Coach Bud Kilmer (Jon Voight). In Texas football
country a coach in pursuit of his 23d district championship gets
his way even if he is a racist bully and pumps injured players full
of drugs. But no amount of painkiller will restore Bud's star
quarterback, and that introduces the backup, Jon Moxon (James Van
Der Beek).
</P>
<P>
   A West Canaan rarity, Mox has a rifle for a throwing arm and an
application pending at Brown, which makes him smart enough to
challenge the coach in a ``crisply directed but entirely
predictable all-American morality play'' (Stephen Holden).

   Rushmore
</P>
<P>
   A cocksure 15-year-old, Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman)
organizes everything at Rushmore Academy from the chess club to
double-team volleyball. That kind of entrepreneurial flair attracts
Blume (Bill Murray), a local steel magnate and Rushmore's leading
benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing a budding kindred spirit, Blume, who is in a midlife
funk, befriends the boy and even underwrites a Fischer scheme or
two.
</P>
<P>
   But then Blume and Max fall for the same smart, attractive
teacher (played by Olivia Williams), turning Wes Anderson's film
into ``a particular treat for its skewed, hilarious memories of a
cutthroat boyhood'' (Maslin).

   LANSKY. David Mamet's introspective treatment of the mob figure
whose gambling interests helped give us Las Vegas defies the
conventions of crime drama by providing a reflective essay of a
sedentary, aging figure stewing in his own frustrations. ``This
playwright's hope seems to have been to challenge the cartoon
nature of Mafia movies,'' Walter Goodman wrote of the HBO movie in
The New York Times. ``Although the screenplay may be more realistic
than bloodier crime chronicles, it is wan as drama.'' 1999. HBO.

   ALICE IN WONDERLAND. Miranda Richardson makes a screeching Queen
of Hearts in NBC's version of Wonderland, which also teems with
delightful puppets and animatronic characters. But awkward devices
and Lewis Carrol's language, so engaging when scrutinized on the
page, tends to fly past too quickly to make much sense (or
nonsense) in ``a quasi-faithful version,'' Caryn James wrote in The
Times, ``that preserves the shell but not the essence of Carroll's
tale.'' 1999. Hallmark. $19.98. 129 minutes. Closed captioned.

   STEPHEN KING'S STORM OF THE CENTURY. ``Give me what I want, and
I'll go away,'' says the stranger with the walking stick topped by
a wolf's head that comes alive. By then it's snowing very hard in

Stanley Kubrick's classic movie of the `The Shining.''' 1999.

<HEADLINE>
FORMER GILLETTE CHIEF DID NO FAVOR FOR SUCCESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who succeeded Alfred Zeien as chief executive at Gillette
was going to have a tough act to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Zeien, who retired in February, presided over a golden age at
Gillette. In his eight years on top, the company's stock price
climbed about 500 percent, the razor franchise dominated the world,
and the company acquired a new business, batteries, that offered
the potential for robust growth in the future.
</P>
<P>
   But Zeien made life even tougher for the new guy, Michael
Hawley, with his final appearance before Wall Street analysts in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Zeien could hardly contain his bullishness that day. Yes,
Gillette had been hurt in the third quarter of 1998 by troubled
overseas economies, he admitted, but he dismissed the quarter as
``a singular event.'' Said Zeien, ``We had a bad third quarter and
everybody knocked the hell out of the stock. This is sending a
message that now we're catching up to where we should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeien used words like ``phenomenal'' and ``enormous'' to
describe the Mach 3 razor and he predicted that Gillette as a whole
would see its earnings growth rate rebound to its customary 15 to
20 percent level in the second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The stock climbed 14 percent on the day of his talk.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounded great. Too bad it wasn't right.
</P>
<P>
   The rebound Zeien envisioned has not materialized. In April the
company announced disappointing sales and earnings for the first
quarter. Last week Gillette said the second quarter would be
another poor one.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette said sales growth will be in the ``low single digits,''
a nice way of saying 2 or 3 percent. Profits will be down 20
percent from year-earlier levels. The return to those customary
higher growth rates has been pushed back to the end of 1999.
Gillette's stock is off 34 percent from its March high.
</P>
<P>
   Was Zeien suffering from irrational exuberance? Was he trying to
go out the door on a triumphant note? Hard to say. But what is
clear is that he has saddled his successor with a major credibility
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hawley's job is to make a realistic assessment of the problem
areas, not try to wish them away or hope them away,'' said William
Steele, an analyst with BancAmerica Securities in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem areas are foreign economies that have not
recovered to the extent Gillette thought they would. The company
listed Brazil, Germany, Japan, and Russia as markets that are still
troubled.
</P>
<P>
   The financial crises that plagued Brazil and Russia have eased
but that doesn't mean consumers are out spending money on razor
blades and deodorant. ``The worst may be over but that doesn't mean
there is reason for companies to shout for joy,'' says Ned Riley,
chief investment officer at BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette is hardly the only company that has been hurt by a weak
world economy. Other consumer product companies, including Coke and
Procter &AMP; Gamble, have encountered similar problems. Just Thursday,
Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber blamed a weak second quarter, in part, on
poor sales in Latin America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters look for better economic times ahead in most of the
world, but it remains to be seen whether the improvement will be
significant enough and fast enough to give Gillette much of a
boost. For instance, DRI Standard &AMP; Poor's, a Lexington research
firm, expects Japan and Russia to be in recession through the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette's other problem is the performance of its second-tier
businesses: stationery, toiletries, and Braun, a maker of small
household appliances. The three businesses accounted for about
one-third of Gillette's sales last year and all three are
performing below expectations, the company said last week.
</P>
<P>
   At least a few analysts wouldn't mind seeing Gillette pull the
plug on all three and concentrate on its strengths: razors,
Duracell batteries, and its line of Oral-B toothbrushes. So far
there is no indication that Hawley is contemplating anything that
radical.
</P>
<P>
   For a company that has disappointed Wall Street in three of the
last four quarters, Gillette still has quite a few fans in the
investment community. ``Their core products are doing phenomenally
well,'' says Rary Delaney, an analyst with Fleet Investment
Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what advice they would give Hawley most analysts and money
managers suggested no major changes. ``He should stay the course,''
says Jason Fox, an analyst with Olde Discount Corp., a brokerage
firm.
</P>
<P>
   We'd add some advice of our own: Keep expectations in check. If
things are going to get better, investors will find out soon
enough. Bullish predictions have a way of leading to bearish
performance. Right, Al?

   TAKE-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... its debut.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All three portraits seem utterly innocuous to contemporary eyes.
The controversies, it turns out, stem more from chauvinism and
social mores than from styles of art. Gautreau and Gardner were
judged uppity-looking and brazen. And the British public thought
``The Misses Vickers'' was too much in the French mode: Friction
across the English Channel was one of the themes of Sargent's
career.
</P>
<P>
   One undoubted French influence on Sargent _ though not on ``The
Misses Vickers'' _ was Impressionism. Sargent was willing to adopt
some of Impressionism's subjects (boating scenes and the like). And
he used flickering Impressionist brushstrokes _ but relegated them
to the background. He was too much the portraitist to let the
figures dissolve as they did in true French Impressionism. His
iconic ``Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose'' is often called an
Impressionist painting, but its eerie suspension seems closer to
Symbolism. People love this painting. It's unbelievably pretty,
this scene of two moppets lighting paper lanterns, surrounded by a
garden suffocatingly full of flowers. But it also operates as an
homage to twilight, summer, and childhood, the fleeting aspects of
life.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Sargent wrote a letter referring to the Misses Vickers as
``three ugly young women at Sheffield, dingy hole,'' for the most
part he left little record of how he felt about his sitters. So you
guess which ones he liked, and to which he was indifferent, or
worse. He surely must have liked Lady Agnew of Lochnaw, for his
1892 portrait of her is sublime. She lounges in a bergere
upholstered in flowered silk. Her gaze is direct, subtly sensual,
as is her pose: Under her white gown her legs are crossed, and her
left thigh twists slightly. In the center of her lap is a white
flower. She is all stillness against the agitated brushwork of the
background, as if her self-confidence had made her surroundings
jumpy, the same effect she'd have on men.
</P>
<P>
   Self-confidence overflows in the room that's the heart of the
show, a gathering of the wealthy and powerful from both sides of
the Atlantic. In portraits of Lord Ribblesdale and Lord Dalhousie,
Sargent frankly copies Van Dyck's elongation and hauteur, and the
use of columns and pilasters to accent the verticality and make the
subjects all the more monumental. His women are proud, preening
creatures. (How ironic that the MFA is also currently showing May
Stevens's paintings of the radical socialist Rosa Luxemburg, a
contemporary of Sargent's languid ladies.)
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Sargent wrote that the 78-year-old John D.
Rockefeller looked ``like a medieval saint'' and painted him as a
soulful, emaciated ascetic, cornflower-blue eyes aimed heavenward.
As for Sargent's friend Henry James, the artist made the author
seem astute and perceptive, and painted his plaid waistcoat as a
nonchalant grid.
</P>
<P>
   It's sometimes said that Sargent is the visual equivalent of
James, but literature allowed the latter a level of narrative and
nuance beyond the possibilities of portraiture. It's easier to
immerse yourself in James's excruciatingly detailled world of
privilege than it is to identify with Sargent's sitters. The most
Jamesian of the works in the MFA is the 1898 ``An Interior in
Venice,'' which depicts Boston's Curtis family, distant cousins of
the artist, at home in their Palazzo Barbaro _ where both Sargent
and James were frequent guests, and where James wrote ``The Wings
of the Dove.'' The shadows suggest centuries of European grandeur
muted in the modern age. While highlighting the figures inhabiting
this haunted space, Sargent let the paintings on the walls _
paintings surely by the Venetian masters _ slumber in morbid
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   After the turn of the century, Sargent gradually pried himself
loose from portraiture, turning to landscape, the murals, and the
informal watercolors that provide some of the most sparkling
moments in the MFA show. Watercolor was particularly well suited to
depicting Venice, that most aquatic of cities, whose back alleys
and working classes Sargent had earlier recorded in oils of
tenebrous tones. He resisted the tourist views of the Grand Canal,
preferring an odd corner of a church or the underside of a bridge.
His friends and family turn up in these less starchy pictures, too,
and in his affectionate views of them painting, reading, and
relaxing there is a hint of humor, not a quality often associated
with Sargent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   World War I closed the door on the languorous lifestyle Sargent
had recorded, one where socialites didn't need to justify their
existence any more than flowers did. Being beautiful was enough.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent went to the front, as a British war artist; one result
was ``Gassed,'' a huge, flat, horizontal scene of soldiers blinded
by mustard gas, stumbling across a landscape so barren and
featureless it could be the moon. In the background, barely
discernible figures are playing soccer. Life goes on.
</P>
<P>
   In the same room, the show's last, is an anomaly that is
arguably the most moving work of the 140 here, the MFA's own oil
study of Thomas E. McKeller. A bellman in a Boston hotel, McKeller
was among Sargent's favorite models. He was African-American, but
turns up in the MFA rotunda as a blond Greek god. He was a man, but
Sargent used him as a model for female figures as well. In the MFA
study, he is himself. He poses with knees parted, hands pinned
behind him, and head thrown back, a position that is open and
vulnerable, but no more or less suggestive than Lady Agnew's. He is
the essence of dignity. Golden light rains lovingly down on the
perfect musculature of his nude form. Sargent, master of sartorial
splendor, hit his most poignantly honest moment in this study of a
man unclothed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: When I first bought my computer, I could go to
Start and then Shutdown, and the CPU would turn itself off. Now
when I do this it says, ``You may now shut off your computer,'' and
I have to do it manually. Is there any setting I may have
accidentally changed to cause it to do this?
</P>
<P>
   _ Major Turnoff
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MAJOR: Here's the really stupid part: You can't just turn
off your computer anymore. I remember the first coal-fired Apple II
that I used somewhere back around 1895. You could simply turn it
off or hit it with a hatchet or throw it out of a third-story
window, and it would still work when you turned it back on. Well,
except for the second time I threw it out the window, but that's
another story and it involves an unfortunate misunderstanding with
a very angry roommate, so we'll leave that for another time.
</P>
<P>
   Try turning your computer off with the power switch these days,
and you're in for a very unpleasant experience. There's so much
going on in the background that simply cutting the juice is going
to hammer something. If you want to get an idea how many different,
unseen programs are running, hit Control-Alt-Delete on a Windows
machine, and you'll see the list.
</P>
<P>
   In Windows, you have to do an orderly exit by using the Shutdown
routine. On older hardware, you eventually get that message Major
is talking about when it's safe to kill the power. Newer boxes are
smart enough to turn themselves off unless you tell them otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of places you need to check to get things
back to normal. First, try your PC's BIOS setup utility. Oh, stop
looking at me like some clueless cocker spaniel. Go look it up in
your manual. Once you're in there, don't mess with anything you
don't understand or you could wind up with a shiny new doorstop.
The thing you're looking for is probably called ``advanced power
management'' or something some misguided marketing department
thought sounded equally as flashy. Enable all the power goodies you
can and you'll most likely get the one that turns the computer off
automatically.
</P>
<P>
   The other place you might look is in the Power section of the
Control Panel. Just make sure Windows power management is enabled.
</P>
<P>
   Now the real question is why all hardware manufacturers don't
use the ``off'' switch to initiate a Windows shutdown. My laptop
does it. I've seen one or two other boxes that do it. I think we
should find a couple of ax handles and go ask some hardware guys
why they're not incorporating this handy, stress-relieving feature.
Of course, that may just be the medication talking.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I am using Netscape 4.5 and am wondering if
there is a way to monitor the time I am spending on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the Clock
</P>
<P>
   DEAR ON: Are you sure this is really something you're prepared
to learn? If you discover how much time has been drained out of
your life forever, you may become so depressed you won't want to do
much more than sit in a corner and drool all over yourself. Trust
me. I know. And I have the laundry bills to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   If you're strong enough to face it, surf over to TUCOWS (The
Ultimate Collection of Winsock Software) at www.tucows.com. There
are enough online timers there to send you running for the Prozac.

NO RISK OF PRIVACY FOR SALINGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looks as if J. D. Salinger picked the wrong century _ and the
wrong country _ to be a recluse. In one week, we've seen:
</P>
<P>
   --The public sale of 14 of his personal letters, against his
will.
</P>
<P>
   --His 43-year-old daughter Peggy's announced intention to
publish an autobiography, ``Dream Catcher,'' next year.
</P>
<P>
   --The release of a ``stealth'' biography that is now appearing
on bookstore shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salinger: A Biography,'' comes after several years of research
by Paul Alexander, who has also written books about James Dean and
Sylvia Plath. The publisher, Renaissance Books, has issued no
advance publicity, to avoid provoking the kind of legal attacks
that torpedoed an attempted Salinger biography by British writer
Ian Hamilton in 1987. Indeed, fear of legal entanglements prompted
Alexander's original publisher, Doubleday, to bail out on the
Salinger book last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever Ian Hamilton did, we did exactly the opposite,''
Alexander explains. ``We never contacted Salinger, we didn't send
out any review copies of the book, and we didn't even tell the
sales force about the book. And of course we had to quote as little
as possible from Salinger's writings, so he couldn't block
publication.'' In battling Hamilton, Salinger's lawyers won a
landmark ruling that the recipient of a letter may not quote from
the document without the sender's permission, which placed a vast
trove of Salinger-iana off-limits to biographers.
</P>
<P>
   Why does Salinger fail at being a recluse, while, say, Thomas
Pynchon succeeds? One obvious reason is that Salinger has lived in
the same New Hampshire home for more than 30 years. But Salinger
also behaves in ways that can only bring him notoriety. His battle
royal against biographer Hamilton, for instance, forced him to give
a long deposition to opposing counsel, a portion of which is
reprinted in Alexander's book.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Salinger's curious habit of writing ``fan letters''
_ mash notes, really _ to attractive young women has brought him
unwanted exposure. One such fan letter initiated his brief romance
with Yale undergraduate Joyce Maynard, who has managed to keep his
name _ and hers _ in the papers for two years running. Alexander
writes of a second, similar relationship, with television actress
Elaine Joyce, which began with a piece of fan mail from the
reclusive New Hampshire author.

how to turn a simple wills-and-estates controversy into a PR
Waterloo. 'GBH declined to speak with the Worth writer, of course.

bothers), future archeologists have only to search out the one true
repository of contemporary American culture: our refrigerator
doors. For a number of months, I've had Doug Holder's poem, ``A
Moose in Boston,'' prominently displayed. One reason I like the
poem is that said creature _ remember the famous moose that led
police on a merry dance through Brookline, Waltham, and Brighton
two years ago? _ passed in front of my house. But I also like the

`IDEAL HUSBAND' DELICIOUSLY WILDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
AN IDEAL HUSBAND 
Directed by: Oliver Parker 
Screenplay by: Parker (play: Oscar Wilde) 
Starring: Rupert Everett, Jeremy Northam, Cate Blanchett, Julianne
Moore, Minnie Driver, John Wood, Peter Vaughan, Lindsay Duncan 
Running time: 96 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (brief sensuality/nudity) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having plucked the works of E.M. Forster, Jane Austen, and Henry
James, to say nothing of the nonstop pillaging of Shakespeare,
what's film to do but look to Oscar Wilde to do his bit? Except for
``The Importance of Being Earnest,'' Wilde isn't done often,
although ``Lady Windermere's Fan,'' ``A Woman of No Importance,''
and ``An Ideal Husband'' are just as delectable. The latter emerges
as a sparkling cascade of sexual and other politics in Oliver
Parker's new film. Parker solves the big problem in Wilde, which is
how to get beneath the wit and keep the characters from seeming
brittle. That and a brilliant cast, some subtle pruning, and a
light-handed opening up of the confines of the drawing room make
this new ``Ideal Husband'' delicious.
</P>
<P>
   It strikes a satisfying balance between the stylized and the
simpatico as its wheels are mischievously set in motion when the
main characters converge on a party being given by Jeremy Northam
as a rising young pol, Sir Robert, and his adoring wife, Cate
Blanchett, the highly principled feminist activist Lady Gertrud.
Scarcely has the host had a chance to savor an exchange with his
playboy friend, the play's central character, Rupert Everett's
aristocrat, Lord Arthur _ who plays so earnestly at
superciliousness that you know it has to be a facade _ than he
finds his world about to crumble. It seems a guest, Julianne
Moore's demimondaine from Vienna, has arrived with a letter that
could ruin Sir Robert. She threatens to circulate it if he doesn't
throw his parliamentary weight behind a crooked Argentine canal
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Having already declared himself against it, Sir Robert doesn't
see how he can switch on the eve of the vote without alienating his
wife, and even perhaps his spirited younger sister, Minnie Driver's
Mabel. So the intrigues and complications begin, many involving
clandestine visits to the house of Lord Arthur, whose boast of
never taking life seriously is about to come to an abrupt end.
Parker finds ways to keep things playful, one being a
thrust-and-parry romance between Mabel and Lord Arthur, spiced by
Driver's headlong forthrightness and Everett's droll control.
</P>
<P>
   It's he who has the play's best line: ``To love oneself is the
beginning of a lifelong romance.'' Part of the fun is John Wood's
stuffy father routine and unending exhalations of huffy disapproval
of his ne'er-do-well son, Lord Arthur. Before long, Lord Arthur's
uncharacteristic efforts to help his friends have them all
tight-lipped with anger at him. It spices the comedy played with
suave panache by the exquisitely tuned ensemble. The compromising
letters, secret meetings, and other potentially creaky devices are
more than surmounted not only by the lively and superb acting but
by the film's ability to do justice to the wit. It communicates as
well the considerable reservoir of subterranean sentiment the wit
conceals and renders palatable. In other words, the farce is turned
into comedy, and the comedy becomes romantic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   As with the season's other sublimely written period piece, ``The
Winslow Boy,'' its corner of London, in this instance circa 1895,
is pungently evoked, and efficiently, with no sign of the
resourcefulness dictated by a less than sumptuous budget. Parker's
rewrite even gets away with an audacious in-joke. He includes a
scene at the premiere of Wilde's ``Importance of Being Earnest,''
complete with the playwright's famous curtain speech (Michael
Culkin plays Wilde). But mainly it's the silken ensemble playing
that floats this period comedy into realms of civilized delight. I
loved Everett's underplaying. He makes even the simple act of
sitting down seem funny. Blanchett brilliantly and tangibly
calibrates her character's imprisoning morality. Moore is poised
perfection as the coolly glistening blackmailer. If the noisy toys
of summer have you ready to flee film, ``An Ideal Husband'' is
reason to go on.

CALCULATED `BIG DADDY' WILL PLEASE SANDLER FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
BIG DADDY 
Directed by: Dennis Dugan 
Screenplay by: Steve Franks, Tim Herlihy, Adam Sandler 
Starring: Adam Sandler, Joey Lauren Adams, Jon Stewart, Allen
Covert, Rob Schneider, Josh Mostel, Cole and Dylan Sprouse, Leslie
Mann 
Running time: 93 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (language and some crude humor) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Big Daddy,'' Adam Sandler softens the gross-out stuff by
putting a kid between himself and it. On the whole, it's a clever
piece of manipulation that should keep Sandler's fans happy,
especially the ones hungering for a heavy overlay of sentimentality
on his lovable goofball persona. Actually, the character Sandler
plays here, Sonny Koufax, isn't so much a goofball as a holdout
against adulthood, a law school grad who refuses to join his
buddies clawing their way up through the legal ranks because he has
unresolved issues with his own successful lawyer father.
</P>
<P>
   At 32, he sits around his loft, working one day a week as a toll
collector, living off an accident claim payoff he invested in the
stock market, sleeping late, and watching a lot of TV sports. Call
him irresponsible _ until a 5-year-old boy is dumped on his
doorstep. Sonny's absent roommate is the father of the kid, the
result of a one-night stand. Because Sonny doesn't emulate his
workaholic pals, he has time to play with the kid, cute, of course,
and vulnerable, to whom he immediately takes a shine, and who likes
him back. It doesn't take him long to blend unsuspected depths of
kindness and a flair for parenting with enough urine, spit, and
hooters jokes to fill the screen with a generous stream of the
gross-out humor so essential to megabucks at the megaplex.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term girlfriend we see him with at the outset writes
him off as a loser. So does his his buddy's fiancee, who inspires
all the hooters jokes, but is actually played with a likably gutsy
astringency by Leslie Mann. Her radiant sister, another workaholic
lawyer played by Joey Lauren Adams, who smiles a lot, fills the
girlfriend vacancy, attracted by Sonny's attentive parenting of the
motherless kid named Julian (played in winningly cliche-skirting
fashion by twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse). One of the reasons Mann's
character takes on the appeal she does during what amounts to a
smallish amount of screen time is that she's the only one who
stands up to Sonny. Otherwise, ``Big Daddy'' is a showcase
constructed to enable Sandler to win us over with displays of
sensitivity and crude wit as Sonny fathers his way to adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   The crude wit is a lot easier to take, and funnier, than the
calculated sensitivity. The film scarcely bothers to conceal the
blatant manipulativeness of its too conveniently trouble-free
bonding, relying on Sandler's charm to make us not care about it.
Well, the guy does have a few Mike-Myers-on-quaaludes moments. Some
of his stunts and one-liners are hilarious. He's certainly plugged
into the give-life-the-finger zeitgeist so irresistible to aging
jocks who like to think they're still capable of raising a little
hell. He's not enough of an actor to be able to always conceal a
certain I'm-the-boss-here vibe, and this works against the soulful
nice-guy quality he uses to sugarcoat the bathroom humor. But then
a large part of what's likely to be the widespread appeal of ``Big
Daddy'' is that nobody is going to think of it as brain candy.

MASTER OF THE PORTRAIT GETS A FULL PROFILE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The beautiful people are out in force at the Museum of
Fine Arts: English aristocrats, American plutocrats, the occasional
swarthy exotic spicing the mix. They're the subjects of the
paintings in the John Singer Sargent exhibition that opens to the
public on Sunday, the largest display of his works since the
memorial shows following his death, in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's ``Sargent Summer'' is a grandiose look at the artist's
complete oeuvre, with companion shows of his late landscapes at the
Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and his drawings at Harvard's Fogg
Art Museum. And of course there are the three mural cycles _ at the
MFA, the Boston Public Library, and Harvard's Widener Library _ the
only murals he ever did, all in the Boston area. What the whole
thing demonstrates, though, is that despite his efforts in other
directions, Sargent was peerless as a turn-of-the-century society
portraitist but had equals _ or betters _ at everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the MFA show is luscious. It will be immensely popular
for many reasons, starting with the jaw-dropping talent Sargent
demonstrated from his teens. He was a bravura paint handler,
unquestionably, one who could alter the effect of brush strokes at
will, making you notice them individually when he felt like it,
then melding them into silken seamlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent's Boston connections add to his local appeal. This city
was the expatriate's American base; many of his sitters were
Brahmins with names like Warren, Boit, and Higginson.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the startlingly contemporary beauty Sargent gave
many of those subjects: Their faces would be completely at home on
the cover of the current Vogue. Which brings up the point that
Sargent's real heirs in portraiture aren't painters, but
photographers from Cecil Beaton to Annie Leibovitz and Richard
Avedon, fellow specialists in glitterati.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent's predecessors, meanwhile, are 17th-century painters,
most notably Velazquez and Van Dyck. He emulated their daring
brushwork, their architectural backgrounds, the arrogant poses of
their sitters. He also emulated their mode of career building.
Sargent's career coincided with the Van Gogh-inspired myth of the
artist as eccentric loner, following inner voices. Sargent's art,
on the other hand, depended on patronage and public commissions, as
that of Renaissance and Baroque painters had.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are believers in progress in painting as much as in
other endeavors, and that's where there's a problem with Sargent.
Van Dyck made great forward strides in portraiture; Sargent's steps
were less direct. He was a consolidator and even a collagist of
sorts, borrowing from all sorts of sources, both in style and
subject. The recently restored murals in the MFA rotunda, for
instance, are a pastiche of classical myths that beam beneficently
down on you, their original palette of teal blue and golden ocher
brought back after a yearlong restoration. They are in perfect
harmony with their Beaux-Arts surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   They were unveiled a few months after the artist's death, in
November 1925. By then, a revolution in mural painting was
underway, thanks to the Mexican artists Rivera, Siqueiros, and
Orozco. Nowadays, even museums with neoclassical architecture are
wont to commission Sol LeWitt wall drawings rather than
historicizing murals. But there's much to be said for Sargent's
site sensitivity, the expansive serenity he created in the dome of
the Boston museum. Tiepolo he wasn't, but in the MFA rotunda he
achieved the kind of meshing of art and architecture that was,
until our own era, the goal of mural making.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was in his early 20s, Sargent had hit on
stylistic elements he would stick with for the rest of his career.
He would often deliberately restrict his palette to blacks, whites,
and neutrals, which gives an edge of severity to canvases that
might otherwise have gone sweet. His sitters sometimes look
directly out at the viewer, an unsettling effect. He liked murky
backgrounds of uncertain depth. He also liked a horizontal frieze
format, which he employed in the 1878 ``Oyster Gatherers of
Cancale,'' the 1908 ``Cashmere,'' and the 1919 ``Gassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Children were a frequent subject for Sargent. His are closer to
Lewis Carroll than to Renoir, knowing rather than innocent. Sargent
spent the first phase of his career in Paris, where his most
important patron was the wealthy playwright Edouard Pailleron. His
1881 double portrait of the Pailleron children _ 11-year-old
Marie-Louise and her 16-year-old brother, Edouard _ is downright
spooky. Essays in sullenness, the kids seem to like neither each
other nor the painter for whom they were sitting. The girl's
expression has a drugged intensity; the boy wears a slight sneer.
Their hands are even more revealing, as tense as the rest of the
picture. Marie-Louise makes a fist with one of hers, and spreads
the fingers of the other, clutching the edge of her seat. The
children's clothes are black and white, and Sargent poses them
against a regal red ground, seating them on an Oriental carpet he's
abstracted using a sophisticated shorthand.
</P>
<P>
   When the occasion demanded, though, Sargent could paint tightly,
producing highly finished, conventional, sure-to-please works like
the portrait ``Mme. Ramon Subercaseaux,'' for which he won a
prestigious medal at the Paris Salon of 1881. Sargent's successes
and scandals are hard to comprehend a century after the fact. It
astonishes that the 1884 triple portrait ``The Misses Vickers'' was
voted worst picture of the year in a plebiscite when it was shown
at London's Royal Academy. Reactions to his portraits of Virginie
Gautreau and Isabella Stewart Gardner seem equally out of whack.
Both sparked famous controversies. Sargent had to repaint the strap

shoulder in the original, because the painting caused such a furor.

portrait of his wife that he blocked its public exhibition after
its debut.

AN ABSORBING LOOK AT THE CIA'S ROLE IN TIBET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ORPHANS OF THE COLD WAR 
America and the Tibetan Struggle for Survival 
By John Kenneth Knaus 
PublicAffairs;  398 pp.; Illustrated; $27.50 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a young CIA operations officer in 1958, John Kenneth Knaus
was asked to lecture on Sino-Soviet relations to a group of men
identified only as ``Asians'' at a covert site near Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But realizing that his audience were Tibetan ``trainee
guerrillas,'' including a brother of the Dalai Lama, Knaus scrapped
his ``standard semi-academic presentation'' in favor of what he
hoped would be ``a useful exposition of how their fight was related
to the free world's stand against communism.'' Useful or not, Knaus
was invited to stay for a new year's celebration featuring Tibetan
dumplings and ``lots of American beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Now retired from the CIA and an associate at Harvard's Fairbank
Center for East Asian Research, Knaus recounts the story of the
Tibetan resistance, and the CIA's role, in an absorbing and
valuable book, resisting the temptation to turn the Tibetans' story
into a personal memoir.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's involvement with the Tibetan resistance began in the
early 1950s, just a few years after Mao Zedong's victory in China
and the advance of his People's Liberation Army troops into Tibet.
As the Korean War was winding down, Knaus writes, ``covert action
against communism (had) attained an importance among the CIA's
missions that would not be equalled until the Reagan
administration.'' Support for the Tibetan resistance ``was
tailor-made for a covert action program designed to challenge
communist consolidation.'' And Knaus is almost certainly right when
he notes that ``if Americans had known about it, they certainly
would have supported it.''
</P>
<P>
   The first airdrop of arms and supplies to the Tibetan guerrillas
was made in the early summer of 1958. By early 1959, Knaus writes,
the Volunteer Freedom Fighters force controlled ``large pockets of
central Tibet'' and had the Chinese forces ``definitely under
siege.''
</P>
<P>
   There was now ``a full-scale commitment'' to support the Tibetan
resistance and the CIA's training camp was moved from outside
Washington to the more Tibet-like surroundings of a mountain pass
near Aspen and Vail, Colo. Knaus was the political ``ghegen,''
teaching propaganda techniques, ``supplemented by practical
instruction in the use of a portable mimeograph.''
</P>
<P>
   Quoting the officer then in charge of the CIA's China
operations, Knaus writes that ``there was something so `special'
about Tibet'' _ including a romantic ``Shangri-la factor'' _ that
well into the early 1960s there was ``no opposition . . . to
whatever the CIA proposed in support of the resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   But already the tide was turning. In response to the early
victories of the Tibetan guerrillas, China increased its forces in
Tibet. Within a month after the Dalai Lama fled Lhasa in March
1959, CIA Director Allen Dulles was reporting that ``the resistance
boys had been badly trapped.'' The revolt in Lhasa had been crushed
and there seemed to be ``nothing more'' that the CIA could do at
that time.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was initial support for the operation from the
Kennedy administration, for whom a newly created Special Frontier
Force ``embodied the boldness and innovation of the New Frontier
and the new administration's desire to meet the challenges of the
Cold War in new ways.'' But John Kenneth Galbraith, the newly
appointed ambassador to India, took ``an instant dislike'' to what
he called ``a particularly insane enterprise'' involving
``dissident and deeply unhygienic tribesmen.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1968, the United States cut back on its support for the
guerrillas and in one of the many curious details of this story,
the last military operation of the New Frontier's SFF was with the
Indian Army during the Bangladesh War of 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Citing officials involved in President Nixon's meetings with
Chinese leaders in Beijing in February 1972, Knaus disputes the
notion that Nixon agreed to drop support for the Tibetans. But even
if ``Tibet had not been on the table in the Beijing talks,'' he
writes, ``the era of official support for the Tibetan cause was
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Knaus concludes that the ``basic flaw'' of the operation ``was
not in the logistics but in the concept.'' The Tibetan guerrillas
did not resemble the resistance fighters of Nazi-occupied Europe
who ``benefitted from a greater military effort,'' nor did they
operate from a ``secure territorial base'' as Mao's own forces had
done before 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orphans of the Cold War'' is an authoritative account of
largely unknown events in a still-unresolved struggle. But it
derives its intensity from the personal factor. Knaus recalls his
relations with Gyalo Thondup, a brother of the Dalai Lama and the
man ``most responsible for obtaining the CIA's support for the
resistance.'' They shared a sense of ``the great danger and adverse
odds'' faced by the guerrillas sent back into Tibet. ``They were
the best and the bravest of their generation,'' Knaus writes, ``and
we wept together when they were killed fighting alongside their
countrymen.''

BUICK HAS HIGH HOPES FOR REDESIGNED LESABRE FOR 2000
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Buick's best-selling car for at least the past decade, the
full-size LeSabre sedan has one of the most loyal followings in the
car industry.
</P>
<P>
   More than a million of these cars have been sold in the past 10
years, but the average age of buyers has been 66, something that
Buick and General Motors corporate marketing strategists know has
to change if the Buick brand is going to remain viable.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers, it seems, just aren't jumping into Buicks the way
their parents have, and even now that boomers are aging, they still
seem to prefer their imports _ such as the Toyota Camry, Lexus ES
300, Honda Accord, Toyota Avalon and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the 2000 LeSabre, one of the first cars on the market
to bear the 2000 model-year distinction, and Buick has high hopes
that this LeSabre will combine the best of two centuries and two
worlds: the attributes of the previous LeSabre that attracted the
post-60 crowd, and enough new and slightly daring changes to endear
this car to an entirely new crop of buyers: the now-graying kids of
current and past LeSabre owners.
</P>
<P>
   Buick marketers probably would have let out a collective groan
to hear my significant other's initial assessment of the new
LeSabre as ``my parents' kind of car,'' but unfortunately, that's
the stigma the car has to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   It still is a big, comfortable family car that (in base form)
seats six full-size adults in relative comfort, cruises over bumps
and potholes with the grace one would expect of a Buick, and moves
along at a crisp, if not breathtaking, rate of speed when the gas
pedal is goosed.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some styling cues designed to appeal to the
younger set without turning off older folks who are considering
trading their current LeSabres for a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is the boring, straight, '70s-era dashboard and instrument
panel, replaced by a curved dash and cockpit-style instrument
cluster that are clearly reminiscent of some other modern,
baby-boomer-aimed GM cars such as the wonderful Oldsmobile Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   Designers have dispensed with the gratuitous chrome exterior
trim that is as passe as disco dancing, replacing it with flush
door handles, body-color trim and curvacious lines that make the
2000 LeSabre a lot more stylish in an understated, late-'90s kind
of way.
</P>
<P>
   The new look isn't overdone; in fact, the car still looks like a
LeSabre, and unless you're very familiar with the old one, you
won't quickly notice the changes on the new one.
</P>
<P>
   Such a conservative approach was necessary, Buick marketers say,
because they couldn't afford to lose the current owner body _ 53
percent of whom come back for another LeSabre when they need a new
car. The danger here was in making a new model so radically
different from the old one that the current owner body is repulsed,
while a new crop of buyers has not yet been cultivated. Buick has
already been selling 150,000 of these babies a year, making it the
nation's best-selling full-size car, and it would be bad business
to abandon those loyal buyers on the gamble that a younger
clientele would develop.
</P>
<P>
   Ford made that mistake with its radical redesign of the midsize
Taurus four years ago; the formerly best-selling U.S. car has never
regained its former stature, and Ford has already had to tone down
its looks.
</P>
<P>
   So what would appeal to boomers in the LeSabre besides the
subtle but modern new styling? Among other things, Buick is banking
on improved ride and handling, a Limited model with bucket seats up
front, sun roof, 12-disc CD changer, and such safety features as
active front head restraints, side air bags for the front
passengers, and four-wheel disc antilock brakes to lure young
buyers into showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy just might work if Buick can convince these
consumers that what they really need instead of that sport-utility
vehicle they've been lusting over is a big, roomy and comfortable
sedan. The only problem standalone Buick dealers have with that
strategy, however, is that there is no big, fancy SUV in the
showroom to lure those customers. Buick doesn't sell one; doesn't
have a minivan, either. And one Buick dealer lamented to me that he
never sees anyone under age 60 in his showroom.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, then, will be to get the message across to
younger customers that the new LeSabre is a vehicle they just might
be interested in, one that has plenty of style and substance to
appeal to buyers who deem themselves to be more savvy and
value-conscious than their parents or grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, the new LeSabre comes in two styles: the base
Custom ($22,890 plus $615 transportation), with bench seating for
six, and the Limited ($26,695, plus transportation), our test
vehicle, which comes with front bucket seats and a rear bench. I
liked the console between the two front seats in the Limited,
something that older buyers won't particularly appreciate, but
young buyers will demand.
</P>
<P>
   The only powerplant available is the 3.8-liter V-6 carried over
from the previous model, but with its 205 horsepower connected to a
smooth-shifting four-speed automatic transmission, the engine does
an admirable job of pushing the LeSabre along at highway speeds
(and way beyond).
</P>
<P>
   The ride is firmer than before, and steering response is much
improved, making the LeSabre feel sportier and less like a big,
floaty boat. It's still no sports car, but boomers will appreciate
the handling improvements, and repeat buyers probably won't notice
that the ride isn't quite as soft as before.
</P>
<P>
   Standard equipment on the Custom includes air conditioning,
AM/FM radio, power windows/mirrors/door locks, keyless remote
entry, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, map lights,
intermittent windshield wipers and a security system.
</P>
<P>
   The Limited model include dual-zone climate control, an
air-filtration system, dark walnut trim, a driver-information
center, power front seats, a premium stereo system with cassette
deck, and 15-inch aluminum wheels. A touring package is available,
adding a rear stabilizer, stiffer springs, variable-assist power
steering and 16-inch aluminum wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy is a respectable 19 miles per gallon in the city
and 30 on the highway, making the LeSabre an excellent touring car.

</P>
<P>
   THE PACKAGE: Full-size, four-door, five-passenger, V-6 powered,

</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS: The nation's best-selling full-size car gets
moderate but stylish changes to its exterior and interior to make
the new LeSabre more appealing to a younger crowd without
abandoning the vehicle's older, established owner body. There is
good power from the carry-over 3.8-liter V-6 engine; a firmer ride
and better handling than before; and bucket seats are standard in
Limited models (the base Custom comes with six-passenger bench
seating.)

   HISTORIAN-HOLOCAUST (London) _ Can a writer who thinks the
Holocaust was a hoax still be a great historian? The British writer
David Irving's books have been praised by some of the most eminent
scholars in his field. Yet to Deborah Lipstadt, author of ``Denying
the Holocaust,'' Irving is a propagandist and not a historian at

   J.C.-PENNEY (Undated) _ In mid May, the CEO of the J.C. Penney
Co., stood before shareholders at the annual meeting and predicted
that prosperity was just around the corner. But former employees
and other industry experts think optimism is premature. Penney's
stock may be undervalued because of the strong performance of the
Eckerd's drugstore chain, they say. But the core of the business _
the nearly century-old retail chain _ is as troubled as ever. By

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In their book ``Preventive Defense,'' William Perry and Ashton
Carter, the former U.S. secretary and assistant secretary of
defense, argue that we should rethink the way we understand risks
to national security.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of their new hierarchy they put ``A-list'' threats
such as that which the Soviet Union once presented to our survival.
</P>
<P>
   The ``B list'' features imminent threats to U.S. interests _ but
not to our survival _ such as North Korea or Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The ``C list'' includes important ``contingencies that
indirectly affect U.S. security but do not directly threaten U.S.
interests'' _ the Kosovos, Bosnias, Somalias, Rwandas and Haitis.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is the ``C-list'' issues that dominate our
foreign-policy agenda. Carter and Perry speculate that this is
because the ``A-list'' threats have diminished since the end of the
Cold War. But another reason is that ``C-list'' issues dominate
media attention in the information age.
</P>
<P>
   Nonvital crises such as Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti and Kosovo
continue to force their way to the foreground because of their
ability to command massive media attention. Such crises raise moral
issues that the American people consistently list among their
foreign-policy concerns. Policy experts may deplore such
sympathies, but they are a democratic reality.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic visual portrayals of immediate human conflict and
suffering are far easier to convey to the public than ``A-list''
abstractions such as the possibility of a ``Weimar Russia,'' the
rise of a hegemonic China, the importance of our alliance with
Japan or the potential collapse of the international system of
trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if these larger, more abstract strategic issues were to turn
out badly, they would have a far greater impact on the lives of
most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   So what do we do about the humanitarian concerns and strong
moral preferences that Americans want to see expressed in their
foreign policy?
</P>
<P>
   Americans have rarely accepted pure realpolitik as a guiding
principle. Moreover, human rights and the alleviation of
humanitarian disasters have long been important aspects of our
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   But foreign policy involves trying to accomplish varied
objectives in a complex and recalcitrant world. This entails
tradeoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A human-rights policy is not itself a foreign policy; it is an
important part of a foreign policy. During the Cold War, this
balancing act often meant tolerating human-rights abuses by regimes
that were crucial to balancing Soviet power _ for example, in South
Korea before its transition to democracy. Similar problems persist
in the current period _ witness our policy toward Saudi Arabia or
our efforts to balance human rights in China with our long-term
strategic objectives.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures are more powerful than words, and so arguments about
tradeoffs tend to become emotional and difficult. Few Americans can
look at television pictures of starving people or miserable
refugees and not say that their country should do something about
them.
</P>
<P>
   And acting on humanitarian values is often appropriate; the
United States often does respond to such catastrophes. Sometimes
this is quite easily done, such as hurricane relief to Central
America or the early stages of famine relief in Somalia. But
ostensibly simple cases such as Somalia can turn out to be
extremely difficult to resolve and others, such as Kosovo, are
difficult from the start.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with such hard cases is that the humanitarian
interest that instigates the action often turns out to be a mile
wide and an inch deep. The American public's impulse to help
starving Somalis (whose food supply was being interrupted by
various warlords) vanished in the face of televised pictures of
dead U.S. soldiers being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
   Such transience is sometimes attributed to the popular
reluctance to accept casualties. But that is too simple. Americans
went into the Persian Gulf War expecting and willing to accept some
10,000 casualties.
</P>
<P>
   As this suggests, Americans are reluctant to accept casualties
in cases where their only foreign-policy goals are unreciprocated
humanitarian interests. Ironically, when opinion turns against such
cases, this may not only divert attention and limit willingness to
support ``A-list'' interests, but may also undermine support for
action in other, more serious humanitarian crises.
</P>
<P>
   One of the direct effects of the Somalia disaster was America's
failure (along with other countries) to support and reinforce the
U.N. peacekeeping force in Rwanda, which could have limited a true
genocide in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   There are no easy answers. We could not simply turn off the
television or unplug our computers even if we wanted to. The ``C
list'' cannot simply be ignored. But there are certain rules of
prudence that may help integrate such issues into the larger
strategy for advancing the national interest.
</P>
<P>
   First, there are many degrees of humanitarian concern and many
degrees of intervention to reflect them, such as condemnation,
sanctions targeted on individuals, broad sanctions and various uses
of force. We should save violent options for the most egregious
cases.
</P>
<P>
   When we do use force, it is worth remembering some principles of
what is known as the ``just war'' doctrine: having a just cause in
the eyes of others; discrimination in means so as to not unduly
punish the innocent; proportionality of means to ends; and a high
probability of good consequences (rather than wishful thinking).
</P>
<P>
   We should generally avoid the use of force except in cases where
our humanitarian interests are reinforced by the existence of other
strong national interests. This was the case in the gulf war, where
the United States was concerned not only with the aggression
against Kuwait, but also with energy supplies and regional allies.
This was not the case in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   In the former Yugoslavia (Bosnia and Kosovo), our interests
combine both humanitarian values and the strategic concerns of
European allies and NATO. We should try to involve other regional
actors, preferably in the lead role when possible. In Europe, we
should welcome the idea of combined joint task forces that would be
separable but not separate from NATO.
</P>
<P>
   We should also be clearer about what are true cases of genocide.
The American people have a real humanitarian interest in not
letting another Holocaust occur. Yet we did just that in Rwanda in
1994. We therefore need to do more to organize prevention and
response to real cases of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Genocide Convention is written so loosely and
the word is so abused for political purposes that there is danger
of the term becoming trivialized. But a strict historical
interpretation of the crime, based on the precedents of the
Holocaust and Rwanda, can help to avoid such pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Americans should be very wary about intervention in
civil wars over self-determination. The principle is dangerously
ambiguous. Atrocities are often committed by activists on both
sides and the precedents indicate there can be disastrous
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   How could these rules of prudence have helped in the case of
Kosovo? At an earlier stage, they would have produced more caution.
In December 1992, President Bush issued a vague threat that Serbia
should not attack ethnic Albanians in its Kosovo province, while he
remained silent on Bosnia. A year later, the Clinton administration
reiterated the warning.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was saved from having to back up these threats
by the Kosovar Albanians' pacifist leader, Ibrahim Rugova, who
espoused a Gandhian response to Serbian oppression. After 1996, the
rise of the militantly pro-independence Kosovo Liberation Army
undermined Rugova's leadership. According to journalist Chris
Hedges, the radicals of the KLA, who combine ``hints of fascism on
one side and whiffs of communism on the other,'' were labeled a
terrorist organization by U.S. government officials.
</P>
<P>
   A KLA victory might well have involved atrocities and ethnic
cleansing of the Serb minority in Kosovo. The KLA's refusal to sign
the Rambouillet agreement in the first round of talks in February
let the alliance off the moral hook and should have been used as an
opportunity to step back. Instead, the United States ``fixed the
problem'' by pretending to believe the KLA's promise to accept
autonomy within Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The United States then threatened to bomb Serbia. Milosevic
called the American bluff and initiated his planned ethnic
cleansing of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, new facts on the ground raised Kosovo from the
``C list'' to the ``B list'' of U.S. foreign-policy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The scale and ferocity of Milosevic's ethnic cleansing could not
be ignored. European allies such as the United Kingdom, France and
even Germany joined the United States in calling for NATO action.
If the United States had then pulled the rug out from under its
pro-interventionist allies, it would have produced a crisis in
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The ``C-list'' humanitarian impact had grown immensely and was
now reinforced by a strategic interest in the future of the
American alliance with Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo illustrates how a ``C-list'' issue can migrate to the ``B
list'' of national interests that merit the use of force. Kosovo
itself is not a vital American interest, and it only touches
tangentially on an ``A-list'' issue (the credibility of the NATO
alliance). The ``A list'' also includes the future of Russia and of
international laws and institutions such as the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, NATO, Russia and the United Nations all figure strongly
in how we resolve the Kosovo crisis. And the rules of prudence must
still be applied. If moral outrage or unilateralist temptations
blind Americans to other ``A-list'' priorities, the United States
may dangerously overreach itself and turn a just cause into a
counterproductive crusade.

punish the innocent; proportionality of means to ends; and a high
probability of good consequences (rather than wishful thinking).
</P>
<P>
   We should generally avoid the use of force except in cases where
our humanitarian interests are reinforced by the existence of other
strong national interests. This was the case in the gulf war, where
the United States was concerned not only with the aggression
against Kuwait, but also with energy supplies and regional allies.
This was not the case in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   In the former Yugoslavia (Bosnia and Kosovo), our interests
combine both humanitarian values and the strategic concerns of
European allies and NATO. We should try to involve other regional
actors, preferably in the lead role when possible. In Europe, we
should welcome the idea of combined joint task forces that would be
separable but not separate from NATO.
</P>
<P>
   We should also be clearer about what are true cases of genocide.
The American people have a real humanitarian interest in not
letting another Holocaust occur. Yet we did just that in Rwanda in
1994. We therefore need to do more to organize prevention and
response to real cases of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Genocide Convention is written so loosely and
the word is so abused for political purposes that there is danger
of the term becoming trivialized. But a strict historical
interpretation of the crime, based on the precedents of the
Holocaust and Rwanda, can help to avoid such pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Americans should be very wary about intervention in
civil wars over self-determination. The principle is dangerously
ambiguous. Atrocities are often committed by activists on both
sides and the precedents indicate there can be disastrous
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   How could these rules of prudence have helped in the case of
Kosovo? At an earlier stage, they would have produced more caution.
In December 1992, President Bush issued a vague threat that Serbia
should not attack ethnic Albanians in its Kosovo province, while he
remained silent on Bosnia. A year later, the Clinton administration
reiterated the warning.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was saved from having to back up these threats
by the Kosovar Albanians' pacifist leader, Ibrahim Rugova, who
espoused a Gandhian response to Serbian oppression. After 1996, the
rise of the militantly pro-independence Kosovo Liberation Army
undermined Rugova's leadership. According to journalist Chris
Hedges, the radicals of the KLA, who combine ``hints of fascism on
one side and whiffs of communism on the other,'' were labeled a
terrorist organization by U.S. government officials.
</P>
<P>
   A KLA victory might well have involved atrocities and ethnic
cleansing of the Serb minority in Kosovo. The KLA's refusal to sign
the Rambouillet agreement in the first round of talks in February
let the alliance off the moral hook and should have been used as an
opportunity to step back. Instead, the United States ``fixed the
problem'' by pretending to believe the KLA's promise to accept
autonomy within Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The United States then threatened to bomb Serbia. Milosevic
called the American bluff and initiated his planned ethnic
cleansing of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, new facts on the ground raised Kosovo from the
``C list'' to the ``B list'' of U.S. foreign-policy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The scale and ferocity of Milosevic's ethnic cleansing could not
be ignored. European allies such as the United Kingdom, France and
even Germany joined the United States in calling for NATO action.
If the United States had then pulled the rug out from under its
pro-interventionist allies, it would have produced a crisis in
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The ``C-list'' humanitarian impact had grown immensely and was
now reinforced by a strategic interest in the future of the
American alliance with Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo illustrates how a ``C-list'' issue can migrate to the ``B
list'' of national interests that merit the use of force. Kosovo
itself is not a vital American interest, and it only touches
tangentially on an ``A-list'' issue (the credibility of the NATO
alliance). The ``A list'' also includes the future of Russia and of
international laws and institutions such as the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, NATO, Russia and the United Nations all figure strongly
in how we resolve the Kosovo crisis. And the rules of prudence must
still be applied. If moral outrage or unilateralist temptations
blind Americans to other ``A-list'' priorities, the United States
may dangerously overreach itself and turn a just cause into a
counterproductive crusade.

CITY CHALLENGES AT&AMP;T TO GIVE ACCESS TO INTERNET RIVALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano says
he wants AT&AMP;T to share its cable television lines with competitors,
enabling rivals to use the lines to provide access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano told city employees who negotiated a tentative franchise
agreement with AT&AMP;T for cable television operation to return to the
table with his amendment: He wants a guarantee that AT&AMP;T will give
any Internet service provider access to its equipment, and he wants
it negotiated in a week's time.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's response was succinct. ``It is my firm belief the
proposal is unlawful and unacceptable,'' said Richard Patch, a
lawyer representing AT&AMP;T. ``It would be very difficult, if they
really want to negotiate around this language, because it is not
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that a formal response to Ammiano's request was ``being
contemplated.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, should negotiations fail, Ammiano said he had another
plan: compel AT&AMP;T to make its equipment available through a ballot
measure. ``That would put this in the hands of consumers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of AT&AMP;T are energized by a June 4 ruling by a federal
judge in Portland, Ore.. The ruling upheld that city's requirement
that AT&AMP;T open its system to competing Internet service providers.
AT&AMP;T is appealing the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of buying cable giant TeleCommunications Inc. last
year, AT&AMP;T controls the cable entering San Francisco homes. But if
Ammiano has his way, the lines would be accessible to competing
Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano's statements came during a hearing Wednesday of the
Board of Supervisors' Public Utilities and Deregulation Committee,
which he chairs. AT&AMP;T is entering into a franchise agreement with
San Francisco because of the company's acquisition of TCI, which
has been the city's cable television provider.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has declined to let any Internet service provider use its
cable television connections, which can provide Internet
connections many times faster than conventional telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   The company maintains that ExciteHome Corp., the Redwood
City-based cable modem company, has exclusive rights to provide
access through the AT&AMP;T system.
</P>
<P>
   Critics interpret that agreement as monopolistic, although some,
including a group called the Bay Area Open Access Coalition, are
supported by Internet service providers and AT&AMP;T competitors such
as SBC Corp. and GTE Corp.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's hearing, Keith J. Epstein, vice president and
senior lawyer for SBC, which owns San Francisco-based Pacific Bell,
spoke of innovation and other benefits that would flow from open
access to AT&AMP;T equipment and broader competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can help in any way in drafting language that we think
would be helpful in ensuring open access, we would be happy to do
so,'' he said.

WASHINGTON'S SIMPLISTIC PLANS TO COMBAT VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Whenever our society experiences something like
the Littleton, Colo., school massacre, politicians feel they must
``do something'' in response. So President Clinton and Congress
have been mucking about in a bunch of ideas they hope will stop
such a tragedy in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Restricting the availability of guns to kids is a natural idea,
but proposals to do that haven't gotten far because the National
Rifle Association pays a lot of money to influence powerful
legislators. Leaching our popular culture of violent images is an
equally expedient idea, and a few proposals along these lines have
actually survived.
</P>
<P>
   One is a House bill to give states the right to post the Ten
Commandments in public places, including schools.
</P>
<P>
   Can't you just imagine the poster now _ Charlton Heston,
depicted as Moses (but really the president of the National Rifle
Association), holding up stone tablets with the Ten Commandments
written on them? Yeah, that's really going to stop school killings.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposal has the blessings of Clinton, who _ as we all
know _ has voracious political and personal appetites.
</P>
<P>
   The president wants theater owners to strictly restrict
admission to R-rated movies to customers who can prove they are 17
or older.
</P>
<P>
   The president has done some smart things, but he's done some
dumb things too. This idea is one of the dumb things. Trying to
keep teen-agers under 17 out of R-rated films is an exercise in
futility. As one 14-year-old put it, ``I think if you put more
restrictions on it, kids will just want to go even more.''
</P>
<P>
   The main effect of the ticket policing will be to encourage
teen-agers under 17 to cheat. Clinton's plan is probably making
purveyors of fake IDs very happy.
</P>
<P>
   Some mid-teens don't even have to go that far. A favorite ploy
is to buy a ticket to a PG-rated film, but sneak into an R-rated
movie playing on another screen within the ubiquitous multiplexes
that our culture calls movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as many teen-agers have been telling the press in recent
days, they simply catch R-rated films on HBO or other cable-TV
channels, or go to their favorite neighborhood video store and rent
whatever R-rated films they want.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to believe theater operators will really crack down
on teens wanting to see R-rated films. Teen-agers are the bread and
butter of movie theaters, especially in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   It is simply not in the economic self-interest of theater
operators to discourage teen-agers from buying tickets. And will
theater owners want to incur the wrath of older movie-goers who
have to wait longer in ticket lines as kids get their IDs checked?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan is typical of cynical political posturing that is
all form and little substance: Keep kids from seeing shoot-em-ups
in popular films today and that will solve the youth violence
problem.
</P>
<P>
   I am not dismissing possible links of violence in movies and TV
to more aggressive behavior among youths. But young people who are
loved and nurtured at home aren't likely to ``go psycho'' just
because they got into an R-rated film at the local cineplex.

WINDOWS 98 USER CAN RECLAIM TASKBAR OR CREATE MULTIPLE TOOLBARS AS
NEEDED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Note (at) replaces symbol in e-mail address.) 
 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Yesterday I upgraded to Windows 98 SE. My taskbar now
duplicates the same icons as on the desktop. The taskbar is now
about 1 inch high, and that gets to be valuable real estate when I
use AutoCAD. So, I went into ``Settings'' and hid the taskbar. Now,
I can't see the clock unless I reposition the mouse and recall the
taskbar. Can you tell me how to restore the default (or
``standard``) taskbar?
</P>
<P>
   A: Windows 98 lets you create multiple toolbars that dock with
the taskbar at the bottom of the screen. This can be handy if you
have a set of programs that you use all the time _ but maddening if
you somehow set it up by accident.
</P>
<P>
   In your case, the fix is very simple. Right-click on an open
area of the taskbar and choose Toolbars from the menu that appears.
One of the selections will be Desktop, and it's probably checked _
click on it to uncheck it. That should restore your standard
taskbar.
</P>
<P>
   To add a toolbar, create a folder on the desktop (right-click on
the desktop, choose New and then Folder) and create shortcuts
inside for the programs you want to use. Then drag the folder and
drop it onto the taskbar. It will create a second layer for the
taskbar that will include the icons you created.
</P>
<P>
   To undo this, just use the same solution listed above _ turn off
that particular toolbar.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a new computer that has a modem, speakers and a
microphone. But I can't figure out how to be able to use it like a
speakerphone.
</P>
<P>
   A: Unfortunately, you may not be able to, unless you replace
your modem.
</P>
<P>
   Just having a microphone, speakers and a modem is not enough.
The modem must be capable of handling voice calls. If it can't, no
software in the world will give it that ability.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, before the sub-$1,000 computer came to
prominence, nearly every consumer PC sold came with a voice-capable
modem. Computer makers loaded their systems down with fancy
voice-mail programs. But guess what? Most people didn't use them,
and found that the software often conflicted with software used to
access online services or the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for ways to cut corners, many PC makers have gone back
to simpler modems that just handle data and fax calls. That's
particularly true for budget PCs.
</P>
<P>
   A full-featured voice and fax modem with 56K speeds should cost
in the $100 price range. Most come with rudimentary voice-mail
software, but if you want something more powerful, you might
consider TalkWorks from Symantec. It also comes with the complete
version of WinFax Pro as a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   But remember, if your modem can't handle voice calls, then
TalkWorks will be worthless to you.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference between the Navigator and the
Communicator browser? Which one is better? Second, what's the
difference between the memory cache and the disk cache?
</P>
<P>
   A: Communicator is the name for Netscape Communications'
complete package of Internet access tools, which includes the
Navigator browser, the Messenger e-mail software, America Online's
Instant Messenger chat program, and other components. Navigator is
a component of Communicator.
</P>
<P>
   Memory cache is an area in your computer's random access memory
where pictures and text from the most recent Web pages you visited
are stored. The disk cache is similar, but it's larger and can hold
more images and text.
</P>
<P>
   When you hit the Back button on your browser, you're likely
pulling in the page from your memory cache, which is why it pops up
so fast. If you hit the Back button several times, you'll start to
draw from your disk cache, which is slower.

NOVICE PC BUYERS TAKE DIRECT ROUTE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: note (at) replaces symbol in e-mail address.) 
 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the maturing home computer market, there's a
stereotypical image of the first-time PC buyer that goes something
like this:
</P>
<P>
   A bit nervous about technology. Needs hand-holding. Doesn't want
to pay a lot for this machine. Wants to buy it at retail, because a
high-dollar purchase needs to be touched first.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the first-time computer buyer at the close of the 20th
century is not a comfortable person. So why, then, are so many of
them starting to buy direct?
</P>
<P>
   Gateway, the North Sioux City, S.D., computer manufacturer,
sells its computers directly to consumers. You won't find Gateway
PCs in Best Buy, CompUSA or Micro Center. To get a Gateway, you
have to either call an 800 number, go to the company's Web site or
visit one of the 160-plus Gateway Country stores around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The first two options require that you buy the computer sight
unseen, a serious act of faith when the purchase price is likely to
be more than $1,000. Yet Dataquest, a tech market research firm,
estimates that Gateway was the leading seller of desktop PCs to
consumers in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter
of this one, beating out Compaq Computer Corp., which is the
reigning consumer champ. Between 45 and 50 percent of Gateway's PC
customers are first-time buyers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GATEWAY SERVICE MATCHES IMAGE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gateway has succeeded in two ways. First, the company has
created a brand that is warm and fuzzy and has backed that up with
customer service that matches.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it has created a hybrid direct-retail way of selling in
its Gateway Country Stores. They're direct, in that you don't take
the product you buy home with you; it's shipped to your house. But
it's retail, in that there's a physical location where you can try
before you buy.
</P>
<P>
   (This approach has been emulated in reverse by PC makers that
primarily sell consumer machines at retail. Compaq, for example,
has set up kiosks in electronics and computer stores where buyers
can custom-configure a PC, then have it shipped to their house.)
</P>
<P>
   Gateway does everything it can to play on the legend of its
origin _ that its founders got started by building computers in a
barn. It evokes this image shamelessly. Remember those TV ads with
founder Ted Waitt delivering a PC to his father?
</P>
<P>
   Gateway is not alone, though, in invoking its roots. Compaq used
to love to tout its design-on-a-placemat origin story, though it
has backed off that quaint tale as it tries to repaint itself as a
``big box'' company. And everyone knows the tale of Michael Dell
building PCs in his dorm room at the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   But none of Gateway's competitors has incorporated its roots
into marketing as well as Gateway. In New York for PC Expo, the
annual business trade show, I walked into a Gateway Country store
that's opened in the center of midtown Manhattan, just ``spittin'
distance'' from Central Park. It's quite a jolt to walk off the
hardened, hustle-bustle streets and into a motif filled with cows,
hay, barn implements and tractor seats for stools.
</P>
<P>
   The country-friendly motif is particularly evident where it's
most important _ in Gateway's sales force.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FIRST-TIMERS GET EXTRA CARE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you call Gateway and profess to be a first-time buyer who
knows nothing about buying a computer, you're apt to get treated
with kid gloves. I called, pretending to be a novice, and was
gently walked through a series of questions that tried to determine
what I wanted to do with the computer. The salesperson was
infinitely patient with me. I pretended not to be sure about what I
wanted, just that I wanted to get on the Internet, maybe keep my
home finances, do a little genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   He ultimately recommended Gateway's lowest-priced PC, which
sells for $999, and did not try to sell me something more
expensive. It was, indeed, a comforting experience.
</P>
<P>
   There are still some barriers for some consumers in buying
direct. I get lots of e-mail from buyers who are concerned about
getting burned _ even with established brands like Gateway or Dell
_ and who are worried about what to do if the computer breaks.
</P>
<P>
   And there are still some folks worried about giving their credit
cards to someone over the phone, and certainly over the Web. But
these are fewer and farther between. Even the most hesitant are
being won over, and that's a fundamental change in the way PCs are
being sold.

MAN'S BEST FRIEND ALSO HELPS FIND LAND MINES

<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMERSET, Texas _ In addition to the NATO security forces being
deployed in Kosovo, a squad of specially trained dogs is being sent
into the embattled province to help in the precarious task of
finding land mines.
</P>
<P>
   The Global Training Academy will supply 12 dogs and 12 handlers
for ``humanitarian de-mining'' efforts under a $1.6 million
contract approved by the State Department on June 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to go into the area until the State Department
says it's safe and they've gotten the snipers out of there,'' said
Dan Hayter, who founded the company in 1984 with Jim Parks.
</P>
<P>
   Both men learned to train dogs while in the Air Force and most
of the company's 28 employees are military veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the first private company in the world to train mine
dogs,'' Parks, 59, said at his office in Somerset, a town southwest
of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Mine-sniffing dogs now in another part of the Balkans,
Bosnia-Herzegovina, could begin work next week in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin underscored the danger in
Kosovo: ``There are strong indications that during the crisis in
Kosovo, the Serbian army laid land mines so extensively that the
safe return of refugees and internally displaced persons, as well
as the provision of humanitarian assistance, will be hindered.''
</P>
<P>
   And Matt Murphy, a foreign affairs specialist with the State
Department, said troops from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
are now marking mine fields for the dog teams to clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're waiting for word that the environment is secure,''
Murphy said from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, from our perspective, the de-mining season only
lasts through October before the weather gets bad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Global is the sole provider of mine-sniffing dogs to the
Washington-based company, RONCO Consulting, which has the de-mining
contract with the State Department, Les Wexler, a company
spokesman, said by telephone from his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any other American companies that train the
dogs for de-mining,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   German shepherds and Belgian Malinois were first trained at the
81-acre academy here to sniff out drugs and explosives and to work
as police dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Mine-detection training was added in 1990, and Hayter said
nearly 300 of the company's dogs are now sniffing for explosives in
Afghanistan, Rwanda, Angola, Mozambique, Central America, Bosnia,
Croatia and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest advantage of using dogs is they can work in
terrain that's real difficult for a man to get into safely, and in
areas with a high ore content in the soil, where metal detectors
don't work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It takes about 16 weeks to train the dogs to detect mines, and
the dogs cost $12,000. Bomb-detection dogs go for $8,700, and
drug-sniffing dogs are $5,300.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers accompany the dogs to the client countries to supervise
mine searches until the new owners are proficient in mine-clearing
_ a process which can take three years.
</P>
<P>
   In the field, the dogs work on a 30-foot lead in a team that
includes a handler, three de-mining specialists, and a medic.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for mines has killed three dogs trained by Global,
Hayter said, but there have been no human losses on the staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dogs never know they're in danger,'' Hayter said. ``It's
all a game to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The work is dangerous enough, but it entails perils other than
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 while working for the United Nations in Angola, he said,
rebels surrounded mine-detection team's camp ``and threatened to
shoot anybody who left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want us taking their mines out of the ground,''
Hayter said.
</P>
<P>
   After a six-week standoff, he said, the team was allowed to
leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of run-in would sour many people on a career in mine
detection, but not Paul Brown, who was in Angola.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the job,'' said Brown, 31, who recently returned from a
three-year stint in the central African nation of Rwanda. ``I love
training the dogs, and I really enjoy traveling and working with
different people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This may sound kind of corny, but you feel kind of like a
pioneer,'' he said. ``You've got to learn to become kind of a jack
of all trades. It's very rewarding.''

WILDERNESS IS ONLY A WAVE AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HUEY D. JOHNSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILL VALLEY, Calif. _ One reason I live in the San Francisco
area is because it is situated right next to the wildest wilderness
there is: the sea.
</P>
<P>
   I believe it is important to occasionally encounter the
wilderness of the sea. A taste of salt spray is an elixir that
refreshes your awareness and adds zip to your outlook on life.
</P>
<P>
   A friend who moved here from Chicago two years ago, in part
because of a love of the sea, had not yet been out on the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   I reflected that he might move back to Chicago and free up space
for someone who would appreciate the experience of living here.
</P>
<P>
   Sea winds have been screaming through the Golden Gate for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Driving huge waves against the cliffs and shores of San
Francisco, the swells from those cold winds off the north Pacific
are a reminder that wild nature is very close, even in this urban
setting.
</P>
<P>
   One needs to get out on the sea to really sense it. Sailing or
motoring under the Golden Gate in a small boat is the way to go; a
foot or so from the swells is about right. The beauty is
breathtaking, and the sense of the power of the sea is so immediate
and awesome that it makes humans adjust their outlook.
</P>
<P>
   It demands our respect; it is a force beyond our ability to
manage. The sea's strength is evident in the gentle movement of a
boat riding the swell, as well as in the twisted wrecks strewn
along most shorelines.
</P>
<P>
   The great beauty of the sea lies within one small drop, as well
as in the vast distances that stretch to the horizon, where one can
see the curvature of the Earth. The coast is breathtaking, mile
after mile of rugged rocks and sandy beaches marked with the white
foam of sea spray.
</P>
<P>
   Sea birds are immensely graceful. In summer here, the evening
sky is filled with thousands of sooty shearwaters that skim the
water in great, rolling flocks, never coming ashore except to nest.
Their nesting place is in New Zealand, 7,000 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The pelican is another remarkable bird. Although it appears
ungainly when in slow flight or landing on the water's surface, it
dives with the utmost grace, plummeting into the sea to capture the
bait fish it has spotted near the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The tremendous force of the sea is evident twice each day when
the tide rushes under the Golden Gate with the force of water from
a giant firehose, the current like a mighty river.
</P>
<P>
   In the ocean, life pulses in endless forms: Whales, seals,
birds, fish and plants have all adapted to survive in a wilderness
environment that to humans can be difficult and sometimes deadly.
I've just finished reading a book titled ``A Fisherman's Son,'' by
a member of a family of fishing people from Half Moon Bay. It
reflects the beauty and harsh reality of those who live on the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The awe one feels for the sea is in part fear, and with good
reason. For many of us, the fear adds a bit of zest to the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the skill of a good seaman includes a respect for the forces
involved, and there is little danger in taking a boat ride from
Fisherman's Wharf out under the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   A trip out onto the ocean awakens interests and stirs old
memories; it makes us more aware of how the sea flows around our
lives. Afterwards, looking out to sea will be more meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Articles and books, visits to museums and aquariums _ even walks
on the beach _ are all enhanced by an trip out onto the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The sea is a rich reward for living here.

A LITTLE BREAK FROM FAMILY WORKS WONDERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last weekend, I did a good thing and left my husband, Jimmy, to
the whims of our two little girls.
</P>
<P>
   That might sound mean, but I like it when they rediscover that
they can carry on without me. No one looked starved when I
returned. The house was cleaner than I remembered. There were no
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, I know when the three of them need to be together;
it's usually when I need time alone.
</P>
<P>
   That might sound selfish, but every time I return _ whether it's
after a weekend or a week away _ I discover, and maybe they
discover, how much each of us has grown.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, the hair thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was poufy,'' Asha tells me, drawing a circle around her
head with her arms. ``You know how my hair swells and gets
bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   I cringe, remembering the first time I let her hair hang without
twists or braids. It looked as if it had been electrified. She
cringes and, sensing my discomfort, er, mother's guilt, pacifies
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sorta liked it,'' she says. ``Jamila said it looked like you
did it.''
</P>
<P>
   As they talk, I am reminded of all the things my daughters have
taught me over the years _ about myself, about life. But I think,
too, about how much of my timbre they have inherited.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 and 10, they have the self-confidence I sometimes wish I
had at 41. They are selfless and have the kind of love that can
peer inside my soul and each other's and provide whatever is needed
at the moment: a kiss, a hug, a reassuring word or a nod.
</P>
<P>
   They always seem older than their years, and after each time
away, I realize that they are no longer the babies I once fed at my
breast, or the toddlers who no longer wanted my help.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, it is like beholding myself in a mirror, twice over.
If you recognize your imperfections as much as I do, that can be a
scary thing. It can also be liberating.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the moment, they have been like a heavy coat
keeping me warm in winter or a cool, gentle breeze washing across
my hot face.
</P>
<P>
   I had both sensations Sunday as I listened to Asha's stinging
honesty and witnessed Jamila's self-confidence and the gentle way
she had tried to reassure her little sister about her hair.
</P>
<P>
   All of us hope that our children grow up to be emotionally
healthy. But as with a room that changes according to who picks the
furniture, the fine points can vary.
</P>
<P>
   Some people's chests swell when their children master the
alphabet, win the 50-yard dash or learn to play Beethoven's
Moonlight Sonata. I might be tempted to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   But the proudest moments I've had as a parent are when someone
tells me Asha and Jamila are sweet, well-behaved and kind, because
when all is said and done, those are the things that make it
possible for even strangers to sit down and connect. That's what
makes us human.
</P>
<P>
   We'd spent considerable time practicing the hair thing before I
left Friday. Nothing elaborate, just a single ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   After about an hour, I gave up and left, a bit worried that on
Sunday they would sit in church looking like Little Orphan Annies.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen. Part of me wishes it had, because I want to
be needed by my little girls. No amount of time alone will ever
change that.

   &UR; MACHO, MACHO MAN ...... &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A typical macho man married a typical good-looking lady. After
the wedding, he laid down the following rules:
</P>
<P>
   `I'll be home when I want, if I want and at what time I want -
and I don't expect any hassle from you. I expect a great dinner to
be on the table, unless I tell you otherwise. I'll go hunting,
fishing, boozin', and card-playing when I want with my old buddies
and don't you give me a hard time about it. Those are my rules. Any
comments?`
</P>
<P>
   His new bride said, `No, that's fine with me. Just understand
that there'll be sex here at seven o'clock every night - whether
you're here or not.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IS THIS DIRTY? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A man wakes up his wife during the night with a glass of water
in one hand and two aspirins in the other.
</P>
<P>
   She asks, `What's this for?`
</P>
<P>
   `This is for your headache,` he says.
</P>
<P>
   She says, `But I don't have a headache.`
</P>
<P>
   He smiles and says, `Gotcha!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEW YORK, NEW YORK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An elderly gentleman checked into a New York hotel. The clerk
mentioned the phone service the establishment made available for
calling guests who wished to rise at an early hour.
</P>
<P>
   `No need for that, young man,` snapped the old timer. `I always
wake up at five a.m. sharp - without an alarm clock.`
</P>
<P>
   `Very good, sir,` the clerk replied, then asked, `Would you mind
calling me at six?`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COMPUTER SEX &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An artist, a lawyer and a computer scientist are discussing the
merits of a mistress. The artist tells of the passion, the thrill
which comes with the risk of being discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer warns of the difficulties. It can lead to guilt,
divorce, bankruptcy. Not worth it. Too many problems.
</P>
<P>
   The computer scientist says, `It's the best thing that's ever
happened to me. My wife thinks I'm with my mistress. My mistress
thinks I'm home with my wife, and I can spend all night on the
computer!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MARRIAGE VOWS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A fellow in a bar notices a woman, always alone, come in on a
fairly regular basis. After the second week, he made his move.
</P>
<P>
   `No thank you,` she said politely. `This may sound rather odd in
this day and age, but I'm keeping myself pure until I meet the man
I love.`
</P>
<P>
   `That must be rather difficult,` the man replied.
</P>
<P>
   `Oh, I don't mind too much.` she said. `But, it has my husband
really
</P>
<P>
   upset.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OLDIE BUT GOODIE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Two dog owners were bragging about the intelligence of their
pets.
</P>
<P>
   `The brightest dog I ever had,` said one, `was a Great Dane that
used to play cards. He was great at poker, but finally a friend
complained about him and I had to get rid of him.`
</P>
<P>
   `You got rid of him, a bright dog like that? A dog like that
would be worth a million dollars.`
</P>
<P>
   `Had to,` he replied, `caught him using marked cards.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIFE IS LIKE A BOX ... &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A man is walking down the beach and comes across an old bottle.
He picks it up, pulls out the cork and out pops a genie.
</P>
<P>
   The genie says, `Thank you for freeing me from the bottle. In
return I will grant you three wishes.`
</P>
<P>
   The man says `Great! I always dreamed of this and I know exactly
what I want.
</P>
<P>
   First, I want one billion dollars in a Swiss bank account.`
Poof! There is a flash of light and a piece of paper with account
numbers appears in his hand. He continues, `Next, I want a brand
new red Ferrari right here.` Poof! There is a flash of light and a
bright red brand-new Ferrari appears right next to him. He
continues, `Finally, I want to be irresistible to women.` Poof!
There is a flash of light and he turns into a box of chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IS THIS DIRTY-II??? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Over drinks one afternoon, two guys were discussing former
loves. The first guy told the other that he once broke-up with a
girl long ago because she had a seemingly incurable speech
impediment.
</P>
<P>
   The first guy said, `I'm shocked. I never know you to be one to
be prejudiced against handicaps. What was the girl's problem?`
</P>
<P>
   Taking a sip, the other guy paused and reflected. `She couldn't
say 'yes'.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WISDOM OF THE AGES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A pious man, who had reached the age of 105, suddenly stopped
going to synagogue. Alarmed by the old fellow's absence after so
many years of faithful attendance, the Rabbi went to see him. He
found him in excellent health, so the Rabbi asked, `How come after
all these years we don't see you at services anymore?`
</P>
<P>
   The old man lowered his voice. `I'll tell you, Rabbi,` he
whispered. `When I got to be 90, I expected God to take me any day.
But then I got to be 95, then 100, then 105. So, I figured that God
is very busy and must've forgotten about me, and I don't want to
remind Him!`

AFL-CIO SAYS HISPANICS PAID LESS 

</HEADLINE>

By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Harris County AFL-CIO once again loaded up the
Justice Bus and rolled through Houston on Thursday passing out
``awards'' to employers.
</P>
<P>
   The contingent, part of the more activist AFL-CIO that has been
holding similar events throughout the country this week, drew
onlookers and police as they handed out their plaques.
</P>
<P>
   Each plaque was actually a jab at the employers for alleged
worker transgressions: not negotiating in good faith, paying
Hispanic workers lower wages than white workers and locking workers
out of their plants.
</P>
<P>
   At the Lanier Public Works Building, the activists _ meat
cutters, masons steelworkers and others _ chanted ``No justice
here!'' to protest what the AFL-CIO believes is discrimination
against Hispanic construction workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Harris County AFL-CIO did a recent study and found that when
it comes to public construction projects, Hispanic employees are
paid less than white employees.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said contractors who work for government entities _ like
the city, county, hospital districts and school boards _
misclassify Hispanic employees as semi-skilled or unskilled even
though Hispanic workers perform the same jobs as the white
employees who are classified as skilled. Federal, state and local
construction projects must pay a specified prevailing wage for each
job classification.
</P>
<P>
   The union's review of payrolls found that between 60 percent and
95 percent of misclassified workers were Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough for companies to cheat workers, said Maria D.
Jimenez, director of the American Friends Service Committee's
Immigration Law Enforcement Monitoring Program in Houston. It's
even worse for the government to cheat immigrants, Jimenez told the
chanting union members.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WORKING ON PUBLIC PROJECTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richard Shaw, Harris County AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer, figures
the contractors on the recent rennovation of a Houston building
still owe their employees, who are mostly Hispanic, about $100,000
in back wages, along with penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said the union found similar problems at other public
construction sites, and several misclassification investigations
are underway.
</P>
<P>
   The government entities should be monitoring the payrolls
better, Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   John de Leon, director of affirmative action for the city of
Houston, said his office takes prompt action whenever it gets an
complaint. He said the office also does spot investigations if
something doesn't look right from the weekly payroll records that
contractors must submit.
</P>
<P>
   As for the renovation of the Houston building, a city
investigation uncovered misclassification and $5,000 to $10,000 in
back wages was repaid, de Leon said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CELEBRATING UNION VICTORIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Union members also gathered to celebrate the United Food &AMP;
Commercial Workers, Meatcutters &AMP; Allied Food Workers' election
victory earlier this month at Sanderson Farms, a poultry processing
plant in Bryan, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After rejecting the union last year, the 960 workers voted to
join Local 408 earlier this month after company promises of
bathroom breaks never materialized, said local president Emilio
``Red'' Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger turning point, said Gomez, was when the employees, who
earn between $6 and $8 an hour, found out that at union-represented
plants employees must be notified before their second break that
they'll be held over for forced overtime.
</P>
<P>
   That gives the employees, who are mostly women, a chance to
arrange for someone to care for their kids when they come home from
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not money,'' said Gomez, who still hopes to get a hefty
raise for the poultry processors when he negotiates the first
contract. ``It's self-respect and taking care of their families.''
</P>
<P>
   A supervisor at Sanderson Farms said she couldn't comment and
the division manager wasn't available.
</P>
<P>
   The bus also visited Maxxam's headquarters to give chairman
Charles Hurwitz an ``award'' for locking out the steelworkers at
Kaiser Aluminum and drove to Pasadena to present a similar
``honor'' to Crown Central Petroleum for locking out its refinery
employees. The bus paid a visit to Metropolitan Transit Authority
because of a labor contract dispute with its union.
</P>
<P>
   The union also gave an award to someone who might actually might
want to put the plaque on his wall _ to Jordy Tollett, head of the
Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau, for being a friend
of labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've never forgotten the people in the organization who make
it work,'' said E. Dale Wortham, president of the Harris County
AFL-CIO.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT FUTURE STILL RESTS IN THE BALANCE
 &HT;    920&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
for release Sunday, June 27.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``We are not a monopolist,'' said Bill Gates,
chairman and co-founder of Microsoft Corp., a firm admired,
courted, and feared by much of the high-tech world _ and the target
of the highest-profile antitrust case to come along in a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Gates's assertion cut no ice with Joel Klein, the Justice
Department's antitrust chief. ``The evidence shows a pattern of
anti-competitive activity,'' he told Gates. ``We're going to
move.''
</P>
<P>
   The once secret Gates-Klein exchange took place on May 5, 1998,
around the mahogany conference table of Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell,
Microsoft's law firm, whose plush Washington offices overlook the
White House. A few weeks later, with the talks at an impasse, the
Justice Department filed its historic suit, joined by 19 state
attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, as 21 weeks of testimony before U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson came to an end, the long saga of
Microsoft Corp. vs. the United States entered yet another phase.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have until Aug. 10 present competing ``findings of
fact.'' A month later, on Sept. 10, the two sides must submit their
revised findings after having assessed each other's submissions.
Once those two voluminous rounds of paperwork are out of the way,
Jackson said he will hear closing arguments in his courtroom on
Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government, firmly persuaded that it has got the
best of Microsoft in the courtroom, will hone its remedial options
for Jackson's scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the judge will quietly prod the antagonists to
settle the landmark case, thereby lifting the need for him to issue
a verdict early next year. The Wall Street Journal, citing people
close to the case, reported that further settlement talks took
place three weeks ago between Klein and William Neukom, Microsoft's
veteran general counsel, who sat at the head of the defense table
during the entire trial.
</P>
<P>
   But even as these legal mills grind away, the industry continues
to change at a remarkable pace. The judge's ruling late this year _
not to mention a final decision that may be reached after years of
appeals _ will emerge in a computing world greatly changed from the
one in which the suit was filed.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to Wall Street analysts a few weeks ago, IBM chairman
Louis Gerstner described the present torrent of new
Internet-related companies as mere ``fireflies before the storm,
all stirred up, throwing off sparks.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerstner added, ``The real disturbance in the force is when the
thousands and thousands of institutions that exist today seize the
power of this global computing and communications infrastructure
and use it to transform themselves. That's the real revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's lawyers argue that such revolutionary currents have
already all but swamped the government's case. But the plaintiffs
hold that the same currents make it all the more imperative to bind
Microsoft before it is able to leverage its vast market power to
wrest control of Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mere fact that the lawsuit is taking place'' has brought
change, said William Kovacic, a former Federal Trade Commission
lawyer who has followed the trial as a professor at George
Washington University's law school. ``People see this as a window
of opportunity where Microsoft cannot react as forcefully as they
have before.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Compaq Computer Corp. and Dell Computer Corp., which have
long sold personal computers equipped with Microsoft's dominant
Windows operating system, recently began offering machines that run
the rival Linux system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linux is selling, but our sales are very small,'' a Dell
official noted.
</P>
<P>
   T.R. Reid, a Dell spokesman, pointed to the so-called Internet
browser wars as yet another phenomenon that served as a central
issue during the trial but has gotten scant traction in the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't see our customers as voicing any preference at
all when it comes to browsers,'' Reid said. ``They're quite content
to use whatever browser comes with the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Dell, which currently controls about 13 percent
of the PC market, that means Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
Customers, Reid said, could alternatively order Netscape
Communicator, now part of America Online Inc. ``But they would have
to pay separately for it, since we are being charged for the
browser,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   When Dell founder Michael Dell was recently asked why anyone
would want to pay his firm to pre-load Netscape for them when they
could just as easily download it for free from AOL and countless
other Internet Web sites, Dell replied: ``That's a very good
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell's response suggests how the march of technology could
outstrip the government's remedial formula for Microsoft, assuming
it prevails in court.
</P>
<P>
   At the time it filed its case, Microsoft had yet to ship Windows
98. That flavor of the basic computing platform is a focal point of
the complaint because, as the trial testimony underscored,
Microsoft chose to bind its browser tightly to its operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   But when the time comes to issue a verdict, Microsoft, in all
probability, will have moved on to release its next platform, known
as Windows 2000, a system that has hardly been mentioned in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to know what we'll be asking the judge or what it
would take to settle, go take a look at the original complaint,''
advised David Boies, the Justice Department's lead lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The government's initial ``prayer for relief'' was largely
overlooked at the time because it called for a preliminary
injunction against Microsoft that Jackson refused to grant.
</P>
<P>
   But another section calls on the court to strike down
restrictive pacts between Microsoft and firms such as Compaq and
Dell that curb ``their right to modify the screens and functions of
Microsoft's Windows operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   These arrangements, the government contends, violate Sections 1
and 2 of the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, Microsoft strenuously objects. But, in practice,
the Microsoft culture has changed since the trial began.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the software giant has looked the other way as at
least one computer manufacturer, Gateway 2000 Inc., modified the
Windows startup process so that it could promote its own Internet
access service.
</P>
<P>
   It has also quietly let Dell erase the icon for Microsoft's
Internet browser from the electronic desktops of Windows 98 and
Windows NT in business-class machines, pulling back from its prior
rigid policies.

COOKBOOKS WRITTEN FOR THESE HARRIED TIMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Most of us who cook during the week are
preoccupied with finding dishes to crank out for dinner in under 30
minutes. We want to beat the clock in a fashion similar to the old
game-show strategy. And we want imaginative fast fixes beyond our
routine standbys.
</P>
<P>
   For the past couple of years, cookbook authors have been
addressing the topic at a furious, ever-increasing pace. One of the
latest to join the quick-cooking bandwagon is Sam Gugino.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Cooking to Beat the Clock, Delicious Inspired Meals in 15
Minutes'' (Chronicle; $16.95) grew out of his desire to have good
and interesting food at the end of the day. ``I'm not satisfied
with a bowl of cereal for dinner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gugino, a New York-based food writer and former chef with more
than two decades of cooking experience, may be a little optimistic
about his 15-minute time frame to turn out a dish. Some of his
ingredient lists seem a little lengthy, and inexperienced cooks may
lack the skills to work so quickly. But even if it takes an average
or novice cook, who is not familiar with the recipes and
techniques, 10 or 15 minutes longer, we're still not talking about
a long time in the kitchen. ``And the more you do the dishes, the
faster and more into the rhythm you'll get,'' Gugino pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm into cooking from scratch using fresh ingredients whenever
possible and whenever they make sense _ and into using convenience
items whenever they make sense and the quality is good,'' he said.
For instance he often relies on canned beans, canned tomatoes,
canned chicken broth, frozen or canned corn in soups or chowders,
canned artichoke hearts, jarred roasted red peppers and frozen
peas. ``Use as many convenience products as you think appropriate
to your time and your budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Other shortcuts: Use cut-up produce from the supermarket salad
bar, dried capellini (a long and very thin pasta that cooks
quickly) and fresh pastas. For speed, 90 percent of the dishes are
cooked on top of the stove.
</P>
<P>
   His premise is that each of the book's 60 recipes could be a
meal for an adult during the week or on the weekend. ``These are
meals, not 15-minute recipes, geared to the way we eat today,'' he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
   Gugino has tried to make each creation _ such as Bouillabaise,
Chicken Curry With Tropical Fruit and Basmati Rice, Middle Eastern
Lamb With Cucumber Salad and Spaghetti Carbonara _ satisfying
enough in taste and amount to stand on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation of his approach involves four concepts: flavor,
organization, focus and creativity. ``They will enable you not just
to pick out a recipe here and there, but to develop a lifelong
strategy for meals that are fast, faster, the fastest you have ever
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Flavor means keeping a well-stocked pantry (including items in
the refrigerator and freezer) with ingredients of good intensity of
taste and texture (so you can use fewer of them) such as sesame
oil, assorted olive oils and vinegars, capers, Dijon mustard, Asian
fish sauce, etc. Organization means having the proper equipment
handy to speed up meal preparation while focus refers to paying
attention to labor-saving details to turn the meal out fast.
Creativity involves thinking about strategies for improvising and
preparing meals in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of the cookbooks on fast cooking, Gugino's is not
dependent on cooking ahead to get a jump start on weekday meals.
</P>
<P>
   Other volumes that have popped up to help win the weekday battle
against time and monotony include:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Desperation Dinners! Home-Cooked Meals for Frantic Families
in 20 Minutes Flat,'' by Beverly Mills &AMP; Alicia Ross (Workman
Publishing; $13.95).!off! Some recipes appear more lengthy than
others, but one of the authors' goals was to keep peeling and
chopping to a minimum, so most of the ingredients simply need to be
tossed into the dish being prepared. Taste of the dish is the
primary consideration. ``If the meal doesn't taste good, you're not
going to eat it,'' write the authors, who are not professional
chefs. You'll find lots of appealing ideas for stews, skillet
meals, entree salads, pasta, breads, breakfast for dinner, easy
entrees and desserts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jane Butel's Quick and Easy Southwestern Cookbook,'' by Jane
Butel (Harmony Books; $23)!off! is a must for those who love
Southwest or Tex-Mex cuisine. More than 100 simple recipes for
spicy, colorful dishes bursting with flavor are offered _ and all
can be made in 20 minutes or less. Most require no more than five,
readily available ingredients. Ready for Chile Rubbed, Grilled Rib
Eye Steak, Chicken Breasts Baked in Salsa, Turkey Chili With a
Margarita Splash, Quickie Tamale Pie or Spicy Hot Chocolate Mousse?
Head for the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Working Stiff Cookbook, Great Food! Easy Recipes!'' by
Bob Sloan (Chronicle Books; $15.95).!off! To avoid takeout or home
meal replacement or frozen dinners as a dinner option, Sloan, the
father of two, gives strategies and recipes to get a decent,
delicious, home-cooked meal on the table when you have little
excess time or energy. Peruse it for some simple, flavorful and fun
main-course options (along with a few side dishes and desserts)
like 10-Minute Salmon, Stir-Fry Furioso, Grandma Sally's Easy
Broccoli Soup and Jerk Skirt. The book has chapter tabs and a
spiral binding making it easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Guerrilla Cooking,'' by Mel Walsh (St. Martin's Press;
$19.95).!off! The title is catchy and the contents about
``fast-strike meals that are cheap, bold and fun.'' Many of the
recipes _ like Taco Soup, Mexican Spaghetti, Lemon Meringue No-Pie
and Shortcut Chinese Chicken Salad _ sound appealing and are fast
and easy. This book contains grassroots-style cuisine _ nothing
exotic _ with reasonably priced ingredients. Lots of quick
appetizers and desserts here along with strategies for streamlining
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Working Mom's Fast &AMP; Easy One-Pot Cooking,'' by Jeanne
Besser (Prima Publishing; $15).!off! With this book in hand, you
can prepare more than 100 entrees from start to finish in a single
pot, most in 30 to 40 minutes. While the dishes cook, you can put
your feet up or do other tasks. An added bonus _ cleanup will be
minimal.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Weeknight Survival Cookbook, How to Make Healthy Meals
in 10 Minutes,'' by Dena Irwin, R.D. (Chronimed; $14.95).!off! The
book title is a bit misleading as many of the 10-minute weeknight
recipes depend on using leftovers from a Sunday head-start meal
(which takes 1 to 1 1/2 hours to prepare). Thus the author
recommends following the menu for each 12-week cycle in the book,
in the order given. Many quick cooks would probably find this too
complex, intimidating and confusing. The book would seem to have
limited appeal unless you are simply looking for ideas to add to
your repertoire or want to follow the plans and recipes exactly. &UR;  &QL;

 &HT;    Make your own natural beauty produts
 &HT;    By Christi Mays
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The key to natural beauty may be found in the
kitchen, not the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Dig around in your kitchen pantry and you'll probably find the
ingredients to make an assortment of natural homemade beauty
products like deep-moisturizing facial masks, minty hair
conditioners and honey-soothing cleansing scrubs.
</P>
<P>
   From everyday food items and bath products most people already
have at home, such as honey, eggs, milk, oils, oatmeal and bath
soap, it's a cinch to concoct natural formulas of beauty products.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Honey Board, foods such as honey have
been used throughout the centuries as part of skin- and hair-care
regimens. Honey was a popular ingredient in makeup in the 1800s,
and today manufacturers are increasingly using the sweetener in
skin moisturizers, facial masks, hair products and shower gels in
response to consumer demand for more natural formulas.
</P>
<P>
   Many foods can be used to make beauty products. Use highly
acidic fruits, such as lemons and grapefruits, to help dry oily
skin. Use low-acidic foods, such as carrots, avocado, honeydew
melon, mayonnaise and plain yogurt for moisturizing dry skin, as
well as any type of oils, including olive, coconut and vegetable.
Oatmeal, brans and almonds are nourishing exfoliates and eggs are a
nourishing deep cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Some homemade beauty products (the ones that don't require
refrigeration) also make great gift ideas when poured into a
decorative bottle.
</P>
<P>
   When you're ready to experiment, try a variety of mixes to find
out which works best for your skin type. And remember, food isn't
just for eating.

CURBING SPECULATION, NOT INFLATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone expects that the Federal Reserve Board will raise
interest rates Wednesday. The only question is whether the Fed will
raise them 25, 50 or 75 basis points (a quarter of a percentage
point, half a percentage point or three-quarters of a percentage
point).
</P>
<P>
   Although everyone knows this will happen, it may well be the
most misunderstood story in American journalism. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan will not raise interest rates to ``stem
inflationary forces'' or ``keep inflation in check.'' He will do so
to take some air out of what he believes is a very dangerous
speculative bubble. Put simply, he's trying to ``soft-land'' the
rocket-fueled US financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan is not raising rates to ``fight'' inflation because
there is no inflation. And there isn't going to be any inflation to
speak of for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   How do we know this? One need only look at the commodity markets
and the cyclical stocks on Wall Street. Commodity prices are
through the floor. Gold is so far down it may, as Street.com
columnist Jim Cramer says, cost nothing in the near future. Silver
is down, copper is down, oil is lingering in the basement. Look
across the board of the major agricultural commodities and it's a
wonder that anyone farms anymore. Prices could hardly be lower.
</P>
<P>
   The cyclical stocks are equally moribund, as they stagger from
quarter to quarter without hope of maintaining what used to be
called ``price discipline.'' Price discipline is one of those
wonderful Wall Street phrases that means keeping prices high in
concert with the competition.
</P>
<P>
   The reason there is no such thing as ``price discipline''
anymore is Internet technology. The Web, as columnist Cramer points
out, is the greatest inflation fighter of all time. It makes
inflation impossible in all but monopoly markets. And where
monopoly (or duopoly) markets exist, the Web still creates downward
pressure on prices.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a company called Accompany.com., which aggregates
customers for a specific product. Let's say the product is a
refrigerator. One person could go to an appliance store and buy a
very good refrigerator for, say, $700. But if 100 people band
together and say they all want to buy the exact refrigerator, they
would get a bulk order discount of roughly 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Accompany.com (people accompanying other people to buy the same
thing) organizes individual buyers into a group of buyers and, via
Web technology, creates a bulk order. Everybody gets the same
refrigerator for $500. General Electric and Maytag can't raise
prices in an environment like that.
</P>
<P>
   And this technological force is in its infancy. It hasn't even
begun to reach into every nook and cranny of industry. Wait until
major corporations start aggregating their orders for raw materials
with other major corporations. Wait until 10,000 people come
together to buy that refrigerator. Wait until the fiber optic pipe
is fully operational and 75 million housholds in the United States
are aggregating their buying power through companies like
Accompany.com.
</P>
<P>
   How much do you think a gallon of milk will cost? Without
government price supports, it might cost a dollar. How much do you
think a roll of 36 film exposures will cost? It'll cost a dollar.
How much ``price discipline'' can be maintained in a market that
aggregates buyers like that? The short answer is none.
</P>
<P>
   Internet technology checks inflation at almost every turn, since
it makes markets exponentially more efficient. And Alan Greenspan,
more than any other Federal Reserve Board governor, understands
this. He has been talking about the productivity gains derived from
Internet technology for years now. He believes it is a transforming
technology that, among other things, acts like a power brake on
inflationary forces.
</P>
<P>
   What Greenspan is concerned about is not inflation, but
speculation. The roaring bull market of the last 16 years (and
particularly the last four) has led to a dramatic increase in
margin buying. Margin buying allows the owner of 1,000 shares of
Microsoft stock to borrow against that asset and buy, say, more
shares of Microsoft stock. As long as Microsoft stock keeps going
up, everything's grand. If Microsoft stock tanks, however, then our
hypothetical owner has to sell his original 1,000 shares to meet
his ``margin call.''
</P>
<P>
   Since margin buying of stocks is at record levels, it is not
hard to imagine a situation where a series of cascading margin
calls could lead to financial panic.
</P>
<P>
   This is essentially what happened in Japan in the late 1980s,
and that country has been in a depression since. Greenspan does not
want to end his tenure as chairman of the Federal Reserve
overseeing Japan redux. So he will raise rates slowly to deflate
what he regards as a speculative bubble. Senior Wall Street traders
believe he will do so in three increments, 25 basis points at a
time. They're guessing, but it seems like a good guess. It's not
about inflation. It's about speculation.

MASSON TAKES ANIMAL BEHAVIOR TO HUMAN LEVELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHERBORN _ As a camera focuses on them, Jeffrey Moussaieff
Masson turns to his 2-year-old son and mock whispers, ``Don't say
cheese here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here'' is at a gathering of the Boston Vegetarian Society at
the Peace Abbey, where fromage is a four-letter word.
</P>
<P>
   The author of two best-selling books on animal emotions, ``When
Elephants Weep'' and ``Dogs Never Lie About Love,'' Masson, 58, has
become a guru in the animal rights world.
</P>
<P>
   But Masson _ Sanskrit scholar, onetime psychoanalyst, authority
on Freud, and famed libel litigant against New Yorker writer Janet
Malcolm _ stands out in his newfound crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Just moments before the picture taking, the earthy gathering had
parted in the driveway to allow Masson's flashy yellow VW bug to
pull up. Masson emerged handsome, tanned, and fit, with his young
family.
</P>
<P>
   The magic of his recent books may be that Masson is a bit of an
outsider looking in. In both books, he takes mountains of material
and weaves a captivating and convincing argument that our fellow
creatures do indeed have feelings. Masson's outsider status gives
him the sense that he is careening through the animal world _
unencumbered by scientific affiliations, but also hampered by the
lack of formal education in the subject.
</P>
<P>
   As he sits out at a picnic table on a muggy, overcast Sunday at
the peaceful abbey, Masson talks about crafting his books.
</P>
<P>
   He contends that many scientists are legitimately afraid to
probe the notion of feelings in animals, fearful that they will be
labeled anthropomorphic. But he says his perspective gives him
freedom to push the envelope.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the book he's working on now should ruffle a few
feathers: concerning, as it does, the emotional life of farm
animals. He will attack that issue with his scholar's zest _
reading through thousands of books in preparation. (He is shipping
1,500 books for the project home to California, from his temporary
digs in Boston.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, Masson frets about how much he doesn't know. And he is
constantly telling stories on himself. He appears the polar
opposite of the image that emerged from Malcolm's 1983 two-part
profile in the New Yorker _ that of a vain, intellectual gigolo and
academic hustler. The picture may linger still, long after his
much-watched and notoriously bitter $7 million libel suit, in which
Masson prevailed with one jury (that deadlocked over damages), and
lost to the next, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Asking a scientist friend to look over one of his manuscripts
recently, Masson reports, the friend phoned him, shouting over the
line: ``Jeffrey! You said a grebe is a kind of duck!'' Masson is
laughing and shrugging. ``What do I know?'' Masson may confuse a
diving bird with a duck, but he's got some big thoughts right. He
has struck a chord with hundreds of thousands of animal lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Masson appears bemused and even baffled a bit by his rocketing
popularity. He has written many books in his varied career _ ``My
Father's Guru,'' ``The Wild Child,'' ``The Complete Letters of
Sigmund Freud to Wilhelm Fliess, 1887-1904,'' and ``The Peacock's
Egg: Love Poems from Ancient India,'' among them. But, he says most
of them drew few readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was such a failure as a writer,'' he says, almost with glee.
``There were more reviews than copies sold.'' (Clearly, though, he
was a big enough deal to warrant the New Yorker's attention to
begin with.)
</P>
<P>
   So he decided to go back to writing about an early love _
animals. As a kid growing up in Berkeley, Calif., he collected fish
and frogs and turtles and other creatures.
</P>
<P>
   He says that he figured, ``As long as I can't make money anyway,
I may as well do something I'm interested in.'' Depressingly, he
says, his editor concurred. ``You might as well stick to what you
don't know,'' he was told. Not exactly encouraging. Neither was a
rejection of ``When Elephants Weep,'' by Sierra Club publishing.
The house didn't think it would sell, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Masson can afford to relish the memories now. ``When Elephants
Weep'' was on the New York Times bestseller list for nine weeks in
hardcover and three months in paperback. ``Dogs Never Lie About
Love'' was on for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Masson could be arrogant about how things turned out, but in an
interview he's not. He seems humbled by the world of nature he has
been immersed in, comparing it to the best of human behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son Ilan is happy to be at the garbage dump if that's where
he is,'' Masson says. ``He thinks it has nothing on the south of
France. And (famed chimp expert) Jane Goodall has a Buddha-like
tranquility. I lack that, and I'm trying to learn . . . from
animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Masson, like many of us, believes that animals have something
profound to offer our species. ``I compare myself to dogs and I
come up short,'' he says. ``I really mean that. Dogs live in the
here and now. They're Zen masters.''

QUESTIONS LINGER IN WAKE OF EMPLOYEE CHANGES AT FORT WORTH ZOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Without question, the Fort Worth Zoo is one of North Texas'
premier community assets. A combination education and entertainment
mecca, the zoo has been successful at attracting millions of
visitors each year to help enhance Fort Worth's reputation as a
cultural center in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As a public asset, it naturally draws scrutiny if something
changes at the park, and that includes personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth Zoo is instituting what officials described as
sweeping changes in its education program, in part to act as a
better resource for the public schools and to attract federal grant
and foundation money that is available for conservation and
education efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of achieving those goals, officials swept out
some of the men and women who helped cement the zoo's distinction
as one of the top five zoological parks in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo Director Gregg Hudson said that in an effort to be more
competitive with the other informal education programs from which
parents can choose to send their little ones, the zoo is requiring
that all paid teachers hold state teaching certificates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents wants certified teachers,'' Hudson said. ``They expect
certified teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Ken Seleske was laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Seleske, who holds a bachelor's degree in psychology and a
master's in zoology, has forgotten more about animals than most
people could ever absorb in a lifetime. An animal expert with 23
years' experience at the zoo, Seleske has been responsible for
expanding the knowledge of countless people _ young and old, at the
zoo and throughout Tarrant County classrooms _ about the wonders of
God's various creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Barbara Opdenhoff, whose position was eliminated
through department restructuring, Seleske had daily contact with
the zoo's cadre of docents whose thousands of volunteer hours since
1972, valued at $1.5 million, are vital to the nonprofit zoo's
operations. Ken and Barbara O., as Opdenhoff is called, helped
train the docents in everything from conservation and general
taxonomy of animal species to the specific characteristics of each
animal found at the zoo. In turn, the docents helped teach the more
than 120,000 youngsters who came to the zoo during the 1998-99
school year for everything from one-hour sessions to full-day
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the docents were devastated at the news of the
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Full disclosure: I have firsthand knowledge of just how upset
the docents are because my sainted mother is one of them. She
received the zoo's Volunteer of the Year award last year and
considers Ken and Barbara O. part of her extended family. In our
family, if Mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the parents of the more than 1,500 children who signed
up for zoo school this summer may have indeed asked about teacher
qualifications before registering their children. It's more likely
that there was an assumption on their part that the zoo wouldn't
have folks in the classrooms who didn't know their bisons from
their water buffaloes. The more intellectually honest explanation
is that the zoo hopes certified teachers will impress grant review
committees that have millions of collective dollars to dole out.
</P>
<P>
   Grant review applications are funny beasts _ credentials,
certifications, the amount of alphabet soup behind someone's name
carry a lot of weight. Just ask any college professor who's ever
applied for foundation money. The time they spend in a classroom
isn't worth a dime; it's how many advanced degrees they have, and
how much they've been published.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything wrong with the zoo going after private and
public grant dollars? Absolutely not. As a nonprofit organization
that sweats out each year's budget allocations, it's a smart
business decision to look for any and all revenue streams.
</P>
<P>
   When the docents put aside their personal feelings about Ken and
Barbara, they can see the big picture of how the zoo must compete
in a world of increasing choices for people's discretionary
dollars. They don't have a problem with changing the curriculum so
that it complements the scientific principles that students are
expected to learn in each grade level under the Texas Essential
Knowledge and Skills established by the Texas Education Agency.
They don't have a problem with upgrading the classrooms to include
computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   They just don't understand why two people who possess incredible
knowledge of and love for animals weren't retained to help make the
changes, instead of being sacrificed to them.
</P>

EXHIBIT PART OF GAY PRIDE CELEBRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Participants in San Francisco's annual festival
of elegant ``excessories,'' now saddled with a cumbersome name _
the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Pride Day Parade _ will
promenade down Market Street on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A ``museum-quality exhibit'' will be at the west end of this
ultimate block party, said Gerard Koskovich, a board member of the
historical society. It will trace the history of sexual minorities
in San Francisco's always accommodating milieu.
</P>
<P>
   While encased exhibits might seem staid amid the revelry,
Koskovich believes they will be popular. Two years in the making,
the eight distinct displays represent hundreds of hours of work by
volunteers and professionals from the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   They also mark a milestone for the historical society.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1985, ``we're at that point where we're turning from
a small community-based nonprofit into a larger institutional
player in this town _ and this shows it,'' Koskovich said.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibits, on display at the Castro Theater, were curated by
the distinctive groups they represent, with help from the pros at
the big museums.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin Aguirre, a 31-year-old writer, headed the Latino/Latina
Community Exhibit Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the display, Aguirre explained how it traces the
evolution of the Gay Latino Alliance (GALA) _ the first gay group
to march in the annual Carnaval festival _ into Projecto Contra
SIDA (the Project Against AIDS) today.
</P>
<P>
   ``GALA died out,'' he said. ``The energy behind GALA dissipated
for a while until the crisis of AIDS came into our community.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguirre said his committee began work on the exhibit about 2 1/2
months ago, with assistance from the staff at San Francisco Museum
of Modern Art. ``This is the first time the historical society has
made a conscious effort to bring in different groups,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koskovich admitted that ``this just scratches the diversity of
all the queer communities in Northern California ... it just
represents a start.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the exhibit typifies a new concept in historical
representation: ``The term is public history _ bringing history to
those who lived it.''
</P>
<P>
   Participation by museum professionals in assisting the volunteer
groups is also rare, Koskovich said. ``Museums don't usually reach
out to people at that level.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit cases are as diverse as the people they represent,
ranging from somber (the devastation of AIDS) to playful.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Glimpse into One Bear's Drawers'' is cheery. ``Bears'' are
gay men who ``have a beard and a bit of flesh to spare, and
preferably some body hair,'' according to writer Adam Mars-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The case contains a large teddy bear, a chest overflowing with
plaid shirts and publicity stills of Sean Connery, Mr. French from
the vintage TV series ``Family Affair'' and Steve Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their matinee idols,'' Koskovich said.

FOLLOWING THE BEHAVIOR OF COMPUTER USERS, MOST DAMAGE NOW SPREAD BY
INTERNET E-MAIL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ On Thursday, June 10, tens of thousands of computer
users got e-mail from someone they knew, but it was not a message
they wanted to receive.
</P>
<P>
   Attached to the e-mail message was a program that purported to
be compressed word processing documents, a common way of bundling
files together. But when the program was launched, nasty things
happened.
</P>
<P>
   First, it scanned the user's e-mail inbox and sent itself to the
first 10 addresses it found. Then, it went looking for found and
damaged word processing, spreadsheet and other crucial data files.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed Worm.ExplorerZip, it was the second malicious program
this year that spread so rapidly across the Internet that major
companies were forced to shut down their e-mail servers _ computers
that have become the lifeblood of 20th-century corporate
communications.
</P>
<P>
   Those who study viruses say a change in the nature of personal
computing has created a fertile environment for the spread of new,
virulent and complex malicious programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an explosion of the Internet, and we have a lot of
novice users who are not savvy when it comes to malicious code,''
said Carey Nachenberg, chief researcher for the Symantec AntiVirus
Research Center, which develops the popular Norton AntiVirus
product. ``These users are spreading these viruses very rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   This is different than the early days of personal computer
viruses, when most were transmitted by users who shared programs
and data via floppy disk. Only a relative handful of users were
online, and occasionally they contracted computer viruses from
software downloaded from bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
   These viruses either hid in the boot sector of the floppy disks
_ the part of the disk that tells computers how to find and handle
its information _ or hitched a ride on program files, infecting
other files when the programs were launched.
</P>
<P>
   Viruses were transferred between computers slowly, and their
spread was checked by simple logistics. Today, viruses have the
potential to spread like wildfire _ and so they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are definitely sharing information over the Internet,
and that's a good thing, but it's also a bad thing, because they
are sharing viruses as well,'' said Nachenberg.
</P>
<P>
   The Worm.ExplorerZip virus is a relatively new type, one that
exploits the newer features of network-connected computers. It also
exploits the behavior of PC users.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's insidious is that these virus writers have an increased
awareness of how people behave and the way they work,'' said Wes
Wasson, director of security products for Network Associates, which
makes the McAfee VirusScan, another antivirus product.
</P>
<P>
   This is known among virus writers and computer hackers as
``social engineering'' _ exploiting either the good will or
outright gullibility of people in order to achieve a malicious aim.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Wells, who has been tracking the spread of viruses in the
computer community since 1993, said he is seeing more and more
viruses that use social engineering. He compiles a list of the
common viruses found ``in the wild.'' Known as the Wild List, it
can be found at www.wildlist.org.
</P>
<P>
   The Melissa virus, which swept across the Internet in April _
clogging e-mail servers and shutting down corporate communications
_ was one of the best examples of these kinds of malicious
programs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Worm.ExplorerZip, Melissa used features found in
Microsoft's Outlook e-mail program to send itself to other people,
so it came from someone who probably was known to the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melissa used three levels of social engineering,'' Wells said.
``It came from someone you know. It said, `Here is the file you
asked for,' so it made you think this mail was a response from that
person. And it said in the text, `Don't show this to anyone else,'
which made you think it was important.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa came in the form of a macro virus, utilizing a feature
in Microsoft's Word word processing program. Macros are like
mini-programs that can be run whenever a user looks at a Word
document that includes them.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of sending Word documents via e-mail has become
common _ even savvy computer users think nothing of routinely
opening one of these when they arrive attached to a message. As a
result, macro viruses are now the most prevalent type.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of viruses and other malicious programs has
followed the evolution of Microsoft's Windows operating system,
said Wells. Although there are viruses that attack Apple's
Macintosh computers, there are far more viruses aimed at the
``Wintel'' platform (as in Windows and Intel Corp., the company
that makes most PC chips).
</P>
<P>
   The early boot sector and file viruses attacked MS-DOS, the
text-based operating system from Microsoft. But nearly as soon as
Windows 3.1 became popular as a graphical shell that hid DOS'
arcane commands, ``there were viruses that blew up Windows,'' Wells
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Windows 95 came out in August 1995, Microsoft also released
a version of Word to go with it in the Office 95 productivity
suite. It included the ability to use embedded macro commands.
</P>
<P>
   ``About a month later, we had Concept, the first macro virus,''
Wells said. ``One year later, we had Larue, the first Excel
(spreadsheet program) macro virus.''
</P>
<P>
   Office 97, the next version of Microsoft's suite, included
features meant to block macro viruses, and macro viruses written
for Word 95 didn't work with Word 97. But Wells said virus writers
soon began writing macro viruses for the new version. Melissa was
one of those, and it disabled Word's built-in virus protections.
</P>
<P>
   Network Associates' Wasson said a growing number of viruses
directly attack Windows 95/98 features. These strains, known as
Win32 viruses, can be particularly destructive.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best-known _ and most-feared _ is the W95.CIH virus,
which the press dubbed Chernobyl. Investigators recently discovered
the author of the virus, a 24-year-old man in Taipei, Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   W95.CIH infects program files on Windows 95/98/NT computers. The
original strain is triggered on April 26 (some variants trigger on
the 26th of every month), and has two ``payloads'' _ the
destructive component of a virus. One overwrites crucial parts of
the computer's hard drive, and can cause it not to boot. The other
attacks some computers' BIOSes, which contain key information about
the machine, such as hard drive type, and time and date.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, fortunately, is not designed to be transmitted via
the Internet. But it can be transferred this way if an executable
file is attached to e-mail, or downloaded via an Internet software
archive.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the speed with which viruses travel, companies such
as Symantec and Network Associates have changed the way they
respond.
</P>
<P>
   They used to offer updates to their antivirus products every 30
to 90 days. Now, those updates are available via the Internet a
couple of times a week _ or even daily, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   For example, within hours of the Melissa and Worm.ExplorerZip
epidemics, both Symantec and Network Associates had fixes for them
on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Both Wasson and Nachenberg say they add 10 to 15 new viruses to
their databases each week _ sometimes even more. They receive
samples of viruses from customers, or from other researchers, break
them down and study them. The information is then included in the
product databases.
</P>
<P>
   Antivirus software looks for telltale characteristics of viruses
_ called fingerprints _ as it scans both a computer's memory and
its hard drive. The antivirus programs can also look for telltale
viruslike behavior, which provides some protection against new or
unknown strains.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the fact that there are tens of thousands of known
viruses, only about 200 to 300 are actively spreading in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   And many of the viruses are not unique, but variations of other,
existing viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Wells said that there are many reasons why viruses are written.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not always the stereotype of the punk with a lot of
pierced body parts,'' said Wells. ``Some people do it for revenge,
to get back at an employer, for example. Or they are messing around
with a programming idea, and they let it get away. Once it gets out
in the wild, it's almost impossible to stop.''

NEITHER HEAT NOR POOR SOIL STAYS THESE SAGES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The virtues of salvias, or sages, are well known to gardeners.
Few plants are more reliable and trouble-free, even if grown in dry
spots with less than perfect soil.
</P>
<P>
   Annual scarlet sage (S. splendens), with its spiky red flowers,
is a mainstay in the flower bed and looks especially good paired
with fuzzy white dusty miller, which can take equal abuse from
weather and soil.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rare herb garden that doesn't include common sage (S.
officinalis), even though its aromatic foliage doesn't make it into
the kitchen as often as it should. More often, culinary sage is
grown for its bluish-green foliage and spring flowers, borne in
spikes, as is typical of the family, and a lovely shade of blue.
They're edible, too.
</P>
<P>
   There's another species of sage that deserves to be as widely
grown as those two: Mexican bush sage (S. leucantha), also called
velvet sage.
</P>
<P>
   In my garden, Mexican bush sage is the undisputed star of the
perennial bed in late summer and autumn. I plant it there even
though it is not perennial in my south-central Pennsylvania climate
(it won't take temperatures below 25 degrees Fahrenheit), reserving
a large spot to accommodate it.
</P>
<P>
   If I put in three plants a foot apart in mid-May, I can count on
a mass of Mexican sage about four feet tall and equally as wide
when they start flowering in August.
</P>
<P>
   The stems are downy white; the leaves, a soothing shade of
mid-green with a slightly pebbly texture. Mexican sage is
attractive as a backdrop to early-flowering perennials until it
takes over with its own blooming show.
</P>
<P>
   And what a show. Mexican sage produces long spikes of bloom,
each up to two feet long with furry purple calyxes and white
corollas. The short-lived corollas drop within a few days (not
before receiving lavish attention from any resident hummingbirds
and butterflies). The calyxes stay fresh-looking for months.
</P>
<P>
   Since the old flowers persist and new ones keep forming, by
autumn the plant is covered with velvety blooms. The irresistible
texture, like the soft foliage of silvermound artemisia or the
furry leaves of lamb's ear, invites caresses.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican sage's height dictates that it be placed toward the back
of the perennial or annual flower garden, but it's wise to leave a
narrow path to it so you can pet it frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican sage doesn't need much encouragement to produce profuse
quantities of flowers (commercial growers have been known to
harvest up to 200 long-stemmed cut flowers from a single plant),
but I do a little early-season pruning to insure plenty of
flowering stems and keep the plants in bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Like chrysanthemums, Mexican sage plants benefit from being
pinched or pruned back early, which results in more flowering stems
later in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Because I propagate my own plants from the previous year's
stock, the plants I put in in May often have a single long stem.
Before I plant, I cut the stem back by about half. This forces the
plant to branch out. When the new stems are 8 to 10 inches long, I
cut them back by half again.
</P>
<P>
   You can pinch back a third or even a fourth time. If you do, you
will get a more compact plant with shorter flower spikes. I like
the graceful, draping effect of long flower spikes, and I have the
space to accommodate a large clump of Mexican sage.
</P>
<P>
   If your space is limited, by all means pinch more often, but
stop by late July. That's when the plant starts to set its flower
buds, and any additional pinching will diminish the display.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican sage makes a spectacular cut flower. If you're
displaying it by itself, you needn't add water to the vase. The
stems are stiff enough to hold the flowers upright while they dry.
The white corolla will drop out, of course, but the calyxes will
retain their deep purple color for months if kept out of direct
light.
</P>
<P>
   Where Mexican sage is perennial (generally Georgia and south),
it will be happiest in soil that drains well, to prevent rot from
killing the plant over winter. Cut the plant back to the ground in
winter, and mulch it with loose straw or leaf compost to prevent
damage from abrupt freezes.
</P>
<P>
   Where Mexican sage is not perennial, take cuttings before frost.
Propagating is simplicity itself. Cuttings should be four to five
inches long, preferably from a nonflowering stem. Because almost
all my Mexican sage stems are in flower by late autumn, I am often
forced to propagate from a flowering stem, and it works. Just get
the shortest flowering stems you can find.
</P>
<P>
   Strip off the lower foliage, leaving one or two pairs of leaves
over a couple of inches of bare stem. Insert the stem in a pot of
wet vermiculite or sand. Keep the medium wet. After a couple of
weeks, test the cutting by tugging on it gently. If you feel
resistance, it has rooted.
</P>
<P>
   Move the rooted cutting into its own pot, using a light potting
mix with plenty of peat and vermiculite, and grow it in a sunny
window. If you cut it back a time or two during the winter, you can
root the additional cuttings.
</P>
<P>
   The cutting will likely bloom over winter, even if it has only a
single stem. Just cut the bloom off when you plant the sage out in
the spring. There's no harm in letting the plant flower indoors,
and it gives you something to pet over the winter.

A'S SALE IS A TANGLED WEB INDEED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Maybe we've been looking at this A's sale all
wrong. Maybe Major League Baseball is happy with Andy Dolich and
George Zimmer and Bob Piccinini and the depth and breadth of their
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Bud Selig and the owners for whom he serves don't care who
owns the A's as long as someone does, and as long as they stay in
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, that would be such a noticeable departure
from form that one should only make that assumption with the
greatest of care. Put another way, we should have our noses at the
ready.
</P>
<P>
   The morass of the Athletics' sale seemed to undergo a serious
detangling Tuesday when the Lyle Campbell/Michael Lazarus/Steve
Stone group announced it was withdrawing its $12 million in
good-faith money. Their version was that Campbell had found other
plans for his 12 large, and that they would await developments
regarding the Dolich group.
</P>
<P>
   It looked, frankly, like capitulation born of frustration. The
Lazarus people didn't like dealing with the Oakland political
structure (and in fairness, can you blame them?), accused the
Dolich people of various acts of sneaky behavior (as-yet unproved),
and thought the local media had been mean to them (largely true,
though sort of petty).
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of their apparent surrender, Michael Lazarus said
something that should cause your ears to twitch. ``We are still
interested in owning a baseball team, including the A's.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly surrender turned to hanging around and waiting for the
other hobnailed boot to drop.
</P>
<P>
   You see, baseball owners rarely allow one of their franchises to
pass freely from seller to buyer without some spirited intervention
tactics. Too much matters to them to let a team just roll itself
over _ location, sales price, lease terms, sales price, friendly
faces, sales price, total wealth, and of course, sales price.
</P>
<P>
   In the Oakland case, there is the added annoyance of the San
Francisco Giants, who have a new stadium arising and would
appreciate it greatly if the A's would (a) get lost, or if that
isn't possible, (b) die. The owners have pondered the Bay Area
problem since almost the day Charlie Finley moved the Kansas City
A's to the left, and despite a series of false starts, still have
two teams in what they all believe is a one-team market.
</P>
<P>
   They seemed amazed, then, to learn that not one but two groups
were interested in giving Steve Schott and Ken Hofmann, the current
owners, more than $120 million for a team everyone says (mostly
incorrectly) can never make money.
</P>
<P>
   Dolich had the local political clout, made possible by Schott
and Hofmann's decision to sell that part of their right to sell to
the city. Campbell chose not to play on Dolich's home court, and
his bid was therefore reduced to a backup's role. Thus, it made no
sense for them to stay in a contest they couldn't win.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, it is a contest Campbell can still win, and
the only thing that didn't make sense was to let someone else hold
his money instead of him.
</P>
<P>
   Dolich won only the right to have his bid placed before the
owners, not the right to be approved. Campbell only surrendered
what he had already lost, the right to have his bid placed before
them first.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if Dolich is turned down by the owners, a group
of men who know that Selig prefers the Campbell group (which means
that the owners Selig is closest to prefer the Campbell group) can
then have Campbell re-submit his offer, or one re-tailored to meet
Schott and Hofmann's mutual approval, and then vote up or down on
that.
</P>
<P>
   The other possibility is that Schott and Hofmann, thus freed by
Dolich's rejected bid, would keep the team and either continue to
squeeze out its annual profit or try to scout up a third bid to
create a new bidding war, one unencumbered by the political
process.
</P>
<P>
   Follow? Well, no, I can see you don't. Then again, this is
baseball, and you're not meant to follow it. You're just meant to
understand this one thing, and to never forget it: If this starts
looking like a simple process, beware. If you think what you saw
Tuesday from the Campbell group tells you something, think again.
And when you're done doing that, think a third time.
</P>
<P>
   This is like watching the Rockies in Denver on a night when the
wind is blowing out _ bring food, and plan to eat more than once.

BLOOD TELLS AND SO DOES BURKE'S 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain, France)   (For release Sunday, June 27) 
 &HT;    (DW) 
 By MITCHELL OWENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call them what you will _ natural, illegitimate, by-blows or
that Old French word, bastard _ children produced outside the
marriage aren't just showing up on the covers of magazines, cradled
by beaming Hollywood moms. They are also being outed in
publications that kept out-of-wedlock children firmly swept under
the Savonnerie.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the new edition of Burke's Peerage and Baronetage, the
106th edition of a studbook of titled Britons that was first
published in 1826. Weighing it at 16 pounds, the two-volume
directory _ which was published last month and is available through
Fitzroy Dearborn in Chicago for $395 _ has something it never had
before: a whiff of tabloid journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Bound in scarlet cotton, the genealogies compiled in its 3,400
pages now include all children, legitimate or not. The Earl of
Snowdon, who was once married to Princess Margaret, is listed,
along with his present wife, Lucy, their 19-year-old daughter,
Frances, and, surprisingly, his year-old son, Jasper, from the
liaison of Lord Snowdon, 69, and the 36-year-old daughter of a
baronet.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist peer and beer heir Baron Moyne, a k a Jonathan
Guinness, is joined by his wife of 35 years, Suzanne, and his five
children _ and a son and two daughters by an extramarital
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan night life fixture Anthony Haden-Guest, 62, is
now, officially, identified as the eldest, though illegitimate,
child of his late father, the fourth Baron Haden-Guest. Since
Haden-Guest's parents did not marry until two years after his
birth, the barony went to his younger and legitimately born brother
Christopher, who is now married to Jamie Leigh Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   Haden-Guest appreciates the belated recognition, though he
considers hereditary titles, especially in an aristocracy riddled
with questions of paternity, ``a charming irrelevance.'' Still, he
said: ``I'm delighted, because I loved my father, so I'm glad it's
in black and white. But as for it's significance? Hell, I live in
New York, not England.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke's typeface may be tiny but the information is like ``Hard
Copy'' in ``Masterpiece Theater'' guise. A baron's son whose
Iranian companion may not be his legal wife, Burke's says flatly,
is in any event, the mother of his child. Lady Cosima
Vane-Tempest-Stewart is identified as the ``nominal'' daughter of
the present Marquess of Londonderry _ though with milady's caveat,
quoted in the book, that she ``claims that Robin Douglas-Home,'' a
politician who died in 1968, is her biological father.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this blunt honesty, Charles Mosley, the book's editor in
chief, said, ``We have a lot of information on people that we would
never publish.'' He mentioned prison sentences and drug addictions.
But when it comes to genealogical news, he added, ``if it appears
in the press, and there is no denial of the fact, we will put it in
the text.'' This was the case with Lord Snowdon's son by Melanie
Cable-Alexander, an editor of the tony British magazine Country
Life.
</P>
<P>
   Burke's sent a draft of its entry to Snowdon with his youngest
child included, and he raised no objection, Mosley said. This is
standard procedure for all potentially touchy entries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curiously, we've got no complaints about listing an
illegitimate child,'' Mosley said. ``But some people have been
annoyed that we're listing someone they wish they could forget,''
like an ex-wife or former son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, many of the world's top society directories, including
the Social Register in the United States, have been participating
in this quiet, well-mannered revolution. Children whose names do
not normally make it into public announcements are showing up,
albeit discreetly, in these social reference books.
</P>
<P>
   Burke's competitor, Debrett's, has listed bastard children for
``15 years or so, but we haven't made a great deal of it,'' said
its editor, Charles Kidd. ``Lord Moyne, for instance, had written
at considerable length about his second family in a magazine or
newspaper article, so it was public knowledge,'' he added. ``He
obviously considered them part of his family, so we wrote to him,
asking if he objected to our including them.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyne apparently did not hesitate, though three telephone calls
last week to his London home were not answered. Neither were three
calls to Snowdon's studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``One or two dowagers may have been a bit shocked at first,''
Kidd said. ``But times have changed so radically in the last 20
years that even the older generation is quite accepting. So it was
quite impossible for us to stand by the old policy of not including
natural children.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Social Register, a New York publication popularly
regarded as staid to the point of inertia, can be a
reading-between-the-lines delight for insiders. (Copies are $105
through written request to the Social Register Association, 381
Park Avenue South, New York 10016.)
</P>
<P>
   According to its spokesman, Thomas Lee Jones, the SR, as it is
called, listed its first out-of-wedlock birth in 1987, in its
births and deaths announcements at the front of each volume. Since
then, there has been at least one in every edition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people who read the book carefully, but it's not the
kind of thing that's touted,'' he added. However, the black book
with the distinctive tangerine racing stripes _ ``Social Register
orange,'' Jones said _ does not indulge in Burke's-style
exposition: just name of baby, date and place of birth, and,
occasionally, a grandparent's name rather than the unwed parents,
to cloak the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful,'' Letitia Baldrige, the
common-sensical etiquette doyenne, said from her office in
Washington. ``Children deserve to be recognized and given their
status. It's not their fault what goes on in the bedroom. Sure, the
acknowledgment might be tough on the family, but when you think of
that bastard child . . .'' _ Ms. Baldrige paused _ ``identification
is the kind and compassionate thing to do. It doesn't meant that
the child's relationship with the father's wife or other children
will be any easier. But it clears the air.''

   Gertrude Himmelfarb, the conservative historian who wrote ``The
De-Moralization of Society: From Victorian Virtues to Modern
Values,'' was not so sure that the listing of illegitimate children
in social registries was a sign of progress. ``What can I say _
it's a sign of times,'' she said, laughing. ``It means they've
bought into the counterculture.''
</P>
<P>
   But the august Almanach de Gotha is adamantly against this
trend. Largely devoted to chronicling the noble families of
Continental Europe, the Gotha recently resumed production after a
55-year hiatus. Published in London by Almanach de Gotha Ltd., the
1999 edition is $110 and can be ordered through bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the parents can't be bothered to integrate illegitimate
children into the family, I don't see why we should do the job for
them,'' said John Kennedy, the editor. He makes a distinction
between legal and verbal acknowledgment of an out-of-wedlock child.
This explains why the Gotha did not publish the name of the
illegitimate son of Prince Konstantin von Schaumberg-Lippe until
this year's edition, after he legally adopted the child, Oliver,
who is now 11. The prince married the child's mother, Petra Maass,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he is legally the man's child, and properly recognized by
law,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bottin Mondain, since 1903 France's guide to its
officially defunct nobility, the situation is much the same. ``I
think I would say no'' to a request to list an illegitimate child,
said its manager, Blanche de Kersaint. ``The parents must be a
legally married couple,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   As for the issue of listing a same-sex couple _ say, the
hypothetical Vicomte de Pamplemousse and his male companion of 30
years _ Mrs. de Kersaint was apologetic but unyielding: ``It's
impossible to write them together. It's a rule of the house. They
would have to be separate. At the same address, yes, but not the
same listing.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, said Martine de Forges, the book's public-relations
officer, the Vicomte de Pamplemousse's companion would have to come
equipped with recommendations from two Bottin Mondain members, just
like any new applicant. (Copies of the Bottin Mondain can be
ordered from its office in Paris: -(33-1) 44.51.13.13.)
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the century, same-sex couples often appeared
together in the thin pages of the Social Register, though cloaked
under innocuous Edwardianism: two unrelated ladies living at the
same address, like the decorator Elsie de Wolfe and her companion,
Elisabeth Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is so `in your face' now, but back then, everything
was more subtle, which allowed that kind of thing,'' said Jones,
who is also the editor and publisher of the SR's sister, a smart
and sassy society magazine called The Observer.
</P>
<P>
   Male couples living together have also appeared, sometimes
together, though usually divided by the alphabet, separate but
equal. ``Ultimately, joint listings are the next step for all of
us,'' Jones added.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he said, the Social Register received a request from a
woman who wanted her female companion jointly listed. ``So I sent
the mate a form, like we do for a man or woman who wants his or her
spouse in the book,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The news of that same-sex application was welcomed by Ms.
Baldrige. ``Providing it's a longtime union, and a serious
relationship,'' she said, ``why not?''

BLIMEY! NEW YORKERS ARE TO THE MANNERS BORN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 27)  
(lh) 
 By JAMES COLLARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was Robert Burns who noted what a remarkable gift it would be
to see ourselves as others see us. As a Londoner who has just spent
over a year living in New York but who is now safely back in
England, I'm in a good position to bestow a gift of this nature on
New Yorkers. With due warning, then, that something well meant but
vaguely unpleasant is coming, I now have to deliver a huge blow to
the pride New Yorkers take in being rude and feisty, and that is to
tell you that in comparison to Londoners, you come across as
exceptionally polite and extremely well behaved.
</P>
<P>
   There, it's out. That wasn't too bad, was it?
</P>
<P>
   But it's absolutely true.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in New York after 12 years of living in London, I was
bowled over by the good will, pleasant manners and overall
graciousness of Manhattanites. It was like finding oneself suddenly
in the middle of a courtly but particularly good-natured Japanese
tea ceremony, and I spent the first few weeks learning to replace
my rude London ways with the cheerful, charming courtesies of New
Yorkers: holding doors open, not cutting in line, saying ``thank
you'' and generally trying not to behave like a savage at a
cocktail party, throwing punches to get to the canapes.
</P>
<P>
   Londoners, brought up on shows set in New York, from ``Kojak''
to ``NYPD Blue,'' arrive expecting the city to be stacked with
buildings the height of the Twin Towers and peopled almost entirely
by criminals and their sobbing victims. So, perhaps my surprise was
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the stereotypes that Americans hold of London are as
equally topsy-turvy. Visiting New Yorkers seem to expect some kind
of modern-dress rendition of a Jane Austen novel, thanks to years
of ``Masterpiece Theater,'' and they must be sorely disappointed.
The Thatcher era taught us to elbow the weaker aside. If the
clipped, phlegmatic Englishman of the American popular imagination
ever existed, he was in a minority: the upper-class product of
boarding schools designed to produce unflappable rulers of estates
long since taken over by the National Trust, or to administer those
areas of the globe once colored pink and now actually run by the
locals.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, I had to adjust rapidly to a world where people
smile breezily on the street (although they laugh less), hold the
elevator and say, ``Have a nice day.'' And mean it. Some of this
can be ascribed to the fact that Manhattan, unlike London, has a
culture of tipping waiters and bartenders; very little in life is
as sure to put a smile on someone's face as the prospect of money.
But New Yorkers' good nature goes beyond that. And this wasn't just
an impression formed during a dewy-eyed honeymoon period in my new
home. A succession of visitors from the old country agreed with me:
New Yorkers are, well, nicer.
</P>
<P>
   It might be because of the topography. Manhattan is physically
an easier place to live in than London, and one designed for modern
life. For all the talk of gridlock, the traffic generally flows
steadily, often swiftly, up, down and across the grid system, and
pedestrians have the run of wide sidewalks. London, by contrast, is
a teeming modern city squeezed into a centuries-old warren of
narrow, often winding streets with tiny pavements. Driving is a
nightmare, and for the pedestrian, life resembles one long, busy
Saturday afternoon on Chinatown's Canal Street, turning a trip to
buy a cappuccino into a Nietzschean struggle, smiles fading and
manners dropped for the ruthless cut-and-thrust of the task at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Along with being quite startlingly impolite these days, the
English are remarkably unbuttoned and signally lacking in phlegm.
The mourning of Diana, Princess of Wales, for example, demonstrated
an almost Latin capacity for public emotion, with the streets of
London lined with flowers and sobbing citizens, like the opening
scenes of ``Evita.''
</P>
<P>
   The English are supposed to be on the frosty side, but it was in
New York that I learned not to be so quick to touch others, and
particularly, not to be so kissy-kissy. New Yorkers may be
friendlier, but they are less physical. The English novelist Evelyn
Waugh bemoaned the inroads that the French business of kissing
friends and acquaintances was making back in the 1950s, and he'd
surely be horrified by today's goings-on. Even Prince Charles, who
is portrayed (somewhat unfairly) as a cold fish, has been known to
kiss not only his sons, but even his brothers in public, and in the
London club scene of today, it's all kisses (on both cheeks), hugs
and warm embraces, even between men _ straight or gay.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, a lot of that brand of bonhomie is substance-based.
Ecstasy burst onto British night life back in the 1980s, unleashing
a hedonism that seems to grow unchecked to this day. Londoners are
far more likely to be boozed up, ``loved up'' on Ecstasy or,
increasingly, coked up than their American cousins, abusing drugs
with a candor that would get you fired in New York, where the days
of the three-martini lunch are over.
</P>
<P>
   While New York has been cleaning up its act since the demise of
Studio 54, London has moved inexorably in the opposite direction.
The British attitude toward drink (there has never been a stigma
attached to being drunk in London) now extends to any substance
that comes to hand. An English hostess once told me that for a
dinner party, she provided ``at least a bottle of wine each, with a
couple or so left over for luck, in case there are some real
drinkers there.'' In New York, such behavior would warrant an
intervention by friends in Alcoholics Anonymous. But in London,
who's to intervene?
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Away from the backdrop of London's large-scale decadence, I soon
realized in New York that I should have some early nights (in ``the
city that never sleeps''!), and sip my chardonnay, not slurp it;
and I also learned not to look at colleagues as if they were stark,
staring mad when they told me, ``Sorry, we can't meet at 5 because
I've got therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, in London, that would most likely blight any career.
</P>
<P>
   I also learned that, despite national stereotypes, New Yorkers
are by far the bigger snobs. Yes, London has its ``in'' places and
its ``it'' girls, but the idea of slumming is equally fashionable.
London's intelligentsia have long enjoyed a love affair with low
life and low _ well, let's call it popular _ culture. The quality
newspapers often follow tabloids like The Sun in covering the news,
to a degree that would be unthinkable in New York. Similarly, all
the English television soap operas are about the gritty realities
of working-class life, thereby encouraging a generation of
privately educated youths to tone down their accents and affect the
slang of their underprivileged peers as portrayed on
``EastEnders.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as British television is more sexually explicit than its
American counterpart _ scenes from shows like ``The Lakes,'' in
which a Catholic priest makes love to a married parishioner, are
mainstream fare _ so everyday language is far more graphic, both on
television and in life. I rapidly learned that the kind of
four-letter words that pepper conversations in London are met with
shocked silence in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   I did encounter New Yorkers' famous feistiness on two notable
occasions, both involving gay activists responding to my views as
the editor in chief of Out magazine (the reason for my sojourn in
New York).
</P>
<P>
   The first time was at a seminar at the New School, at which,
speaking without notes (not particularly well, I should add), and
coming from a country where the idea of gay equality is largely
endorsed by all major parties, my more nonchalant perspective must
have seemed galling to an audience of activists. They punished me
with a barrage of hostile questions, though the rudest thing anyone
said was, ``You're depoliticized!'' It's the old leftist epithet
for someone whose politics differ from one's own, but it seems to
me to be lacking somewhat in offensiveness, as well as intellectual
rigor.
</P>
<P>
   More notably, over lunch with a journalist who at the time wrote
for Out and whose views about journalism I disagreed with, I got a
glass of water thrown in my face. This dramatic departure from
civility occurred, appropriately enough, in the Blue Water Grill,
and therefore made for an amusing little piece on Page Six of The
New York Post. But it's the kind of thing journalists do when
crossed, and looking back, it's hard to bear ill will over H2 0.
Besides, in London it would surely have been a glass of red wine.
</P>
<P>
   And among Out's letters to the editor, I occasionally received
ones along the lines of, ``Shame on you _ resign!'' To some extent,
this was the price I paid for being what the New York press came to
call a ``controversial editor.'' But editors, controversial or
otherwise, learn not to take such missives to heart. One of the
enduring nightmares of publishing is the fact that, with a few
honorable exceptions, only lunatics and very angry people take the
time to write to a magazine. In the end, such diatribes played
little or no part in my decision to resign last month.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason, frankly, was that for all of New York's charms,
there's no place like home. And so I've returned to England,
condemning myself to a life spent at the mercy of sullen waiters,
loutish youth and elevator doors that close in my face, just as I
shout, ``Hold the lift!'' It is an ordeal I intend to take breaks
from, by taking regular trips across the Atlantic _ to enjoy the
New World courtesies of the Big Apple, if that's OK. In the
meantime, thank you very much, and have a nice day. &QL;

NIGHT OUT WITH AMY SOHN 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 27) 
(mk) 
 By ANTHONY LAPPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amy Sohn surveyed the midriff-baring crowd
indifferently milling about the bar at Drinkland, an East Village
lounge with swirling Austin Powersesque decor, and lamented the
very unshagadelic scene. ``Everyone wants to hook up, but they want
to maintain the air they don't,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sohn is not likely to be accused of putting on cool airs. On
a Saturday night in June, Ms. Sohn, 25, was celebrating the
imminent publication of her first novel, ``Run Catch Kiss'' (Simon
&AMP; Schuster, $23). The book follows her not-so-alter ego, ``a nice
Jewish girl from Brooklyn Heights,'' who graduates from Brown
University and falls into a job chronicling her sex life in a
weekly column. Ms. Sohn's real-life column, ``Female Trouble,''
runs in the New York Press, a free alternative paper, where her
risque, self-mocking take on singledom has a loyal following.
</P>
<P>
   She has become a downtown Candace Bushnell, whose ``Sex in the
City'' New York Observer column has inspired a series on HBO,
though Ms. Sohn loathes the comparison. She, too, has cultivated
the image of a witty flirt and has a television deal in the works,
an animated pilot for Oxygen, the new women's network.
</P>
<P>
   On this evening's revels, she was escorted by her best friend
and source of material, Joanna Yas, 26, a literary magazine editor,
and a friend of Ms. Yas', a veterinary technician visiting from Los
Angeles. Drinkland, on East 10th Street, off Avenue B, is in the
heart of what Ms. Sohn calls the ``danger zone,'' a 10-square-block
area where her last four boyfriends lived. An assortment of
socialists, artists and musicians, they are worlds from Ms.
Bushnell's megarich love interest, Big.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all had sideburns, overinflated egos and serious boundary
issues,'' Ms. Sohn said.
</P>
<P>
   After several vodka, vanilla and 7s, Ms. Sohn, with her wild
curly hair and low-cut dress, demonstrated her flirting techniques.
She sidled up to a handsome investment banker from Iran and began
taunting. ``I heard the unibrow is a sign of virility,'' she said.
Then she challenged him to arm-wrestle. ``Don't worry, I'm
strong,'' she said. He won.
</P>
<P>
   Smitten, the banker bet she couldn't guess his favorite part of
a woman's anatomy. She said, ``Feet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How did you know?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in your eyes,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   At the Music Box, on Avenue B, Ms. Sohn attempted to charm her
way to the front of a line for a pool table. Thwarted, she sounded
the retreat to her friends. At the next spot, Sway, a velvet-roped
lounge on Spring Street, safely west of the danger zone, the women
slid into a booth. Shouting over deejay-pumped hip-hop, Ms. Sohn
described the single girl's lexicon that she and Ms. Yas developed.
``Like to get Ira'd,'' she said. ``That's when you wake up with a
guy on Sunday morning, and all you want is for him to leave, so you
can listen to Ira Glass' `This American Life' on NPR, alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel coincides with a crisis for her column. Her boyfriends
have tolerated, even enjoyed, exposure of their sex life, but Ms.
Sohn's current beau wants to keep his private. ``Good relationships
make boring columns,'' she said. She recently took six weeks off
from the column and is still struggling to find material.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sohn conceded that the thrill of the hunt was losing its
allure. By 2:30 a.m., she was fading. ``Given the choice between
the hottest sex and the most intense conversation, I wouldn't
hesitate for a second to talk.'' Soon after, she slipped out the
door, leaving behind a half-drunk vanilla vodka, and her friends.

THE VERY MODEL OF A GOOD COOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 27) 
(mk) 
 By ALEX WITCHEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cooking with cleavage is not an everyday occurrence
in my kitchen. Neither is cooking in heels. But when a model is
involved, it seems, anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Padma Lakshmi has walked the runway for Giorgio Armani, Gianni
Versace and Ralph Lauren, and has appeared in Vogue, Elle,
Mirabella and Glamour. She has also just published a cookbook,
``Easy Exotic: A Model's Low-Fat Recipes From Around the World''
(Miramax, $25.95).
</P>
<P>
   When I first heard about the book, I laughed. A model who cooks
what? Ice soup? Preposterous. Forget all this blather about a
backlash to Kate Moss, and Calvin Klein shunning supermodels to
photograph real people. I read magazines like everyone else, and no
one in sight has a thigh like mine. But Ms. Lakshmi's book signals
a potential revolution: models not only as real people, but also as
Mama. No more skeletal adolescents fueled by Champagne bubbles, but
robust beauties who shop and cook _ albeit braless, in a tank top,
like Ms. Lakshmi, sporting three miles of leg.
</P>
<P>
   Though she grew up cooking with her grandmother in Madras,
India, Ms. Lakshmi became head chef in charge of homesickness for
her glamorous pals languishing on exotic locations. She cooked them
hearty pots of food, minus any ingredients that could compromise
their employment. She admits to having no formal training, but I
wanted to see how she did it, anyway. I was hoping some magic might
rub off. Eat a model's meal, lose 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   As we set out to shop and cook, I felt the tiniest bit smug.
Someone who looks like Ms. Lakshmi _ 5 foot 9, with a 24-inch
waist, no hips and 34C chest (on the days she does wear a bra) _
probably seems like a culinary genius to other models. But the
relaxed-fit crowd would see right through her.
</P>
<P>
   They certainly saw something. At my corner market, the
stockboys, the manager and the men who passed her on the street
gaped. While she was perfectly pleasant chatting with me, somehow,
when men appeared, she seemed to effervesce _ like an Alka-Seltzer
dropped into water. Which I could have used just watching it. All
rationalizations to the contrary, it was stunning to see such a raw
display of beauty as power, because that's what it was, pure and
simple. Well, not simple, certainly. And certainly not fair.
</P>
<P>
   So I did the most rotten thing I could think of to a model,
knowing she hadn't begun her career until after she graduated from
Clark University in Worcester, Mass., and that she had lived for
six years in Italy and also in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``How old are you?'' I asked. She crossed her arms and said
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to tell me, are you?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never,'' she answered, heading straight to the produce,
snapping off a sprig of cilantro and tasting it. She slipped it
into a bag and zoomed forward, sniffing and picking the way my
grandmother used to. At the register, she looked dismissively at
the head of garlic I had chosen, and replaced it with a container
of peeled cloves. ``So we don't have to smell of it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Out of nowhere, the manager appeared, nodding and smiling, and
credited the head of garlic. I must be in that store twice a week
and I've never seen him do anything but scowl.
</P>
<P>
   We walked back to my apartment, and Ms. Lakshmi talked about the
transition she is trying to make to an acting career. She recently
appeared in a television miniseries in Italy and shot a film that
will be released there in October. It helps that she speaks five
languages: Italian, Spanish, English, Hindi and Tamil, which she
says is spoken mainly by Sri Lankans.
</P>
<P>
   Back in my building, I thought the doorman would faint at the
sight of her. When I mentioned it, she just smiled. ``Would I have
it any other way?'' she asked. ``Come on. But it's up to me to keep
up my end of the bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be diet. Ms. Lakshmi said she never starves herself _
it makes her cranky _ but when it comes to overeating, she will
look at food and say, ``I'm worth too much to put this into my
stomach.'' I nodded, but she might as well have said that part in
Tamil.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, Ms. Lakshmi went straight to business, cutting
and chopping a minimal amount, because in this recipe, misleadingly
called coconut chicken (requiring one can of light coconut milk),
most ingredients for the sauce, including onion, garlic, ginger and
jalapeno, went into the blender.
</P>
<P>
   I offered her one of my aprons, which she tied around her waist
_ twice. Does she exercise every day? She shook her head and
chopped cilantro. ``No, I have a trainer, or I won't go to the gym
otherwise,'' she said. ``Cardio is the best thing for weight
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   She deserves credit for keeping a reasonably sane take on
herself in a business where eating disorders abound amid the
unforgiving scrutiny of something like a runway walk in a string
bikini. Ms. Lakshmi said she had recently broken her engagement to
an Italian man she called ``a food fascist,'' who would tell her
what to eat, how much and when. Since then she dated yet another
food fascist, she said, whose ``waist was smaller than mine.'' She
added: ``If you can't have fun with food, that's a symptom to a
bigger problem. It's one of nature's biggest pleasures, as basic as
breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't always been deprived, however. ``Because of what I
look like I've been wined and dined everywhere,'' she said easily.
``I've had my share of Eurotrash older guys and they've taken me to
wonderful restaurants. I could taste what was in the food, and I
stole the recipes.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen was starting to smell delicious. The way she came to
write ``Easy Exotic,'' which is separated into sections from
countries where she has lived and worked, including Spain, France,
Italy, India and Morocco, was by cooking for some actors in Los
Angeles, where she moved six months ago to pursue her film career.
They mentioned the meal to Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of
Miramax Films, whom she later met at a movie premiere. She told him
it was her dream to write a cookbook _ and voila. He sent her to
Miramax Books. ``This is honestly the food I make for myself and
for my friends,'' models and civilians, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The current craze for eliminating carbohydrates doesn't interest
Ms. Lakshmi, though she advises eating them during the day. ``If
you want rice you can have a tennis-ball-size portion,'' she said.
``But don't expect to lose weight eating a mountain of rice.'' I
felt myself blush. I guess I've been inspired more by footballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And at night,'' Ms. Lakshmi went on, ``you can have some fish
with steamed vegetables. That's fine.'' How did I know she was
going to say that? It's like hearing the same bedtime story with
the bad ending that never changes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the food in the pot, which according to the cookbook
has only 10 grams of fat a serving, was looking sensational. Ms.
Lakshmi basically followed the recipe, though she didn't measure
many ingredients, preferring, she said, to ``eyeball it.'' She
broke into a piece of steaming chicken breast with her bare fingers
and didn't flinch. ``Nice and tender,'' she said, leaving the pot
uncovered so the liquid would reduce.
</P>
<P>
   We sat at the dining room table, where I smoked and she drank
mineral water. She said that for all the talk about a model
backlash, she doesn't see one. ``I think it's the opposite,'' she
said. ``I was considered thin when I first started modeling, but
not anymore. These girls today start really young. They don't even
finish high school. Without an education, I may never have
appreciated the places I went to if I didn't understand where I was
going.''
</P>
<P>
   The chicken was done, and Ms. Lakshmi ate two servings, which
would equal one of mine. No rice.
</P>
<P>
   My husband appeared, bewitched by both the smells in the kitchen
and the woman in the low-cut dress who put them there. But alas, my
stepson arrived from his basketball game too late. Ms. Lakshmi had
gone. He held up the book with her picture on the cover. ``She was
here?'' he asked incredulously. His ardor only grew once he tasted
the food.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's who I'm going to marry,'' he declared, as his father
looked on approvingly. ``A hot girl who can cook Indian food.''
</P>
<P>
   I smiled weakly. Bring on the Alka-Seltzer.

 &HT;    NATO POLICE STRUGGLE TO KEEP ORDER IN KOSOVO'S LAWLESS CAPITAL
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ As refugees pour back into Kosovo in
record numbers, British police forces Friday said there were 14
murders around the capital the day before and the province verged
on a breakdown of law and order.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is quite a lot of lawlessness,'' said Maj. Martin
Williamson of the British Royal Military Police.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 murders Thursday were in the central region of Kosovo
alone, and brought the total there to 26 since NATO arrived two
weeks ago. The population there is difficult to gauge because of
the previous exodus of refugees now returning. But, it is likely
just a few hundred thousand.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the reported murders were thought to be by ethnic
Albanians seeking revenge for atrocities committed by Serbs during
a horrific ethnic cleansing campaign that intensified as NATO
warplanes dropped bombs of Yugoslavia. Looting of Serb businesses
also continued Friday.
</P>
<P>
   British Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, NATO commander of the Kosovo
peacekeeping force, known as KFOR, met Friday with Serbs in central
Kosovo to reassure them that his troops were seeking to restore
order. Thousands of Serbs fearing retribution from angry Kosovar
Albanians have already fled to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Serb officials released 166 ethnic Albanians they
had been holding prisoner in Serbia. There are likely more than a
thousand more being held.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops moved in to control Kosovo on June 12 after the
signing of the military technical agreement that ordered the
withdrawal of Yugoslav forces, and Serb police and paramilitary
gangs. With about 21,000 troops in this war-torn province now, NATO
is responsible for keeping order until the United Nations
administrative government can establish its multinational police
force.
</P>
<P>
   But, NATO has been kept busy focusing on overseeing the
withdrawal of the Serb troops and the disarming of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, crime and tension have been on the rise as Kosovar
refugees return to their homes from refugee camps in neighboring
Albania and Macedonia, and from makeshift hideouts in the
province's mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reported Friday that
48,000 Kosovars returned Thursday, the highest number to date.
UNHCR spokeswoman Paula Ghedini said it was the largest spontaneous
return of refugees in the 25-year history of the refugee agency.
More than 300,000 of the estimated 860,000 refugees that fled Serb
terror Kosovo have returned.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, the United Nations will begin its so-called
organized return, bringing refugees to the country on buses. The
refugee agency has been waiting as NATO-led ``de-mining''
operations have fanned out all over the province to remove
landmines, booby traps and unexploded ordnance like that which
killed two NATO peacekeepers and two civilians earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The expected U.N.-sponsored return of refugees will only tax
more the already-strained law enforcement duties of NATO. For
example, there are only 144 British military police in the capital
region, where looting was rampant Thursday night as ethnic
Albanians stormed Serb businesses in Pristina. NATO officers vowed
to crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the afternoon daylight Friday, a group of about 20 teens
and children smashed the windows of a Serb candy store on
Pristina's main street and made off with boxes and pockets full of
sweets and pretzels.
</P>
<P>
   British troops arrived, arresting two and chasing the rest from
the store.
</P>
<P>
   What happens to those arrested is still undetermined, as there
is no court system. For now, military commanders review their case
after four hours and then every 48 hours to determine if they can
be released or bailed out.
</P>
<P>
   British troops have established three police stations in the
Pristina area, and Kosovars are lining up for hours outside to
report everything from car thefts to murders.
</P>
<P>
   Many were ethnic Albanians reporting crimes committed during the
Serb terror spree.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs, meanwhile, were left hoping NATO would soon increase its
presence. NATO is ultimately planning to have more than 50,000
troops in the province.

BEATNIK.COM CONCENTRATES ON `SOUNDTRACK' FOR WEB SITES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Sixteen years ago, he blinded music fans with
science. Now, Thomas Dolby wants to bewitch Web users with sound.
</P>
<P>
   Dolby, born in Cairo and the son of a British archeologist, has
had a lengthy career in the music business as a producer,
performer, songwriter and session musician, working with everyone
from Lene Lovich to Def Leppard.
</P>
<P>
   Best-known for his quirky, video-driven 1983 hit, ``She Blinded
Me With Science,'' he's mostly been behind the scenes since,
particularly this decade where he's been focusing on what new
technologies such as the Internet can mean for music.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dolby is the public face for Beatnik.com, which has created
an aural equivalent to the Web-friendly low-bandwidth animations of
Macromedia's Flash program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flash is great technology for using animation over the Web,''
Dolby said. ``Instead of sending a movie, you send instructions to
the program. We're the audio equivalent of Flash. We just send
sonic instructions over the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beatnik Player (recently released in Version 2.0 and
available at www.beatnik.com) gets around the limitations of
transmitting good-quality sound on the Web by using a built-in
sound synthesizer.
</P>
<P>
   When a user, say, moves her cursor over a specific spot, the
program on the Web page's end sends an instruction telling the
synthesizer software on the user's end to change the key from C to
F, or make some sound choice available, such as remixing a song
from old collaborator David Bowie, Dolby said.
</P>
<P>
   A $19 upgrade adds ``a few more sound banks, a few more frills''
to the basic software, which is available for most major platforms
and is incorporated in Sun Microsystems' Java language, the
Netscape Navigator Web browser, WebTV and NCI's set-top boxes,
among other places.
</P>
<P>
   But Beatnik's focus is different from other Net music companies,
which are creating file formats that allow people to listen to the
computer equivalent of a CD or radio. Beatnik is more interested in
the ``soundtrack'' for Web sites, which Dolby said is often
overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern was as a composer who has in the past been asked to
do TV commercials, etc.,'' Dolby said. ``When I was asked to do
(sound for) Web sites, there was no appropriate way to do it. When
I speak to this, there's a whole community of professionals in your
city that would resonate with this. Hollywood has had several
decades to appreciate the importance of sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatnik has a gallery area where people can upload their music
files created with the software, or listen to others. The company
is also developing an e-commerce area, so music creators can make
money off their products through sales at the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``When MTV came along, it really changed the way I wrote music,
because I knew there would be a video component to it,'' Dolby
said. ``This is the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The company itself, Dolby included, will create soundscapes for
major Web clients, but Dolby said he would like to see dozens of
competitors also helping create the soundtrack for the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to make sure music would play a part in the
entertainment to come,'' Dolby said. ``I would like what I do in
this space to be part of a movement to revolutionize the medium.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Refugee Net
</P>
<P>
   One of the thorniest problems of the Kosovo conflict has been
reconnecting the swell of more than 800,000 refugees with family
members who may be sprinkled across several countries awaiting
repatriation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no communication at the very beginning, and it was
very difficult to connect families back together, even in camps
only a few miles away,'' said Peter Zimble, president of
InterPacket Group Inc. ``It was just zero communication.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past month, Zimble's Santa Monica-based company has been
helping ease those communication problems using its satellite
technology to link a refugee camp in Macedonia with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   InterPacket already provides such satellite-Net connections to
Internet service providers in about 50 mostly lesser-developed
countries whose antiquated phone systems can't handle heavy data
demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of employees in InterPacket identified a need for
connectivity to help the aid organizations helping the refugees,''
said InterPacket president Peter Zimble. ``They said, `Is this a
good idea?' We said, `Yes.' We talked with the government and the
aid organizations. Then our employees went to Macedonia a couple of
times.''
</P>
<P>
   InterPacket set up an ``Earth station,'' or satellite dish and
related electronics, at a camp in Macedonia, helping the
International Organization on Migration and the U.N. High
Commissioner on Refugees share family information with Kosovo
Albanians sprinkled throughout the region and numerous NATO
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Donors, including an ``unnamed family foundation,'' helped pay
the cost of the equipment and satellite transmission time, and
Gateway donated computers, Zimble said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Dreamcast update
</P>
<P>
   Sega's big push on its next-generation Dreamcast gaming console
is proceeding apace, with a few interesting wrinkles expected to
come out this week.
</P>
<P>
   The company is scheduled to announce a deal Tuesday with
Hollywood Video that will make the 128-bit machines available for
rental as much as two months before they hit U.S. stores on Sept.
9.
</P>
<P>
   The video-gaming trade publication MCV said three games,
including the superfast Sonic Adventure, would also be available.
Sega representatives declined comment, other than to say an
important announcement would be made by the top executives of the
two companies on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   You should start seeing a more direct ad blitz in coming weeks,
too, going from the entertaining but cryptic teasers of recent
weeks to more upfront ads touting the 25 games the company says
will be available this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Sega says more than 100,000 Dreamcast machines have been
pre-ordered through a handful of major retailers, such as Toys R Us
and K-B Toys. The machine has done well, but not extraordinarily
so, since being released in Japan during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   If waiting until Sept. 9 is unbearable, and you don't want to
rent, there's always the gray market in downtown Los Angeles' toy
district. One shop owner there told me Japanese versions of the
machine are going for around $170 wholesale (Sega cut the cost of
its Japanese machine recently from about $245 to about $165).
</P>
<P>
   While the gray market isn't illegal, there are downsides.
English-language games and manuals aren't available, and you'll
probably get a slower modem than the 56.6 kbps device planned for
the U.S. version.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sony says it will show off its next-generation
PlayStation 2 in relatively market-ready form this fall in the
Tokyo Toy Show.
</P>
<P>
   The box of blinking lights that I saw at May's Electronic
Entertainment Expo was a long way from a finished product, however
impressively it handled daunting graphical challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Sony also is sending signals that it knows how to get its costs
down. Observers have said the machine, packed with a DVD drive,
powerful graphics and central processor chips and a wide array of
peripheral connections would cost more than $400, way beyond the
price most folks want to pay.
</P>
<P>
   But Sony said it invited a new kind of digital light oscillator
that will read both DVD and CD discs, allowing it to cut the number
of chips the machine needs from 11 to four, saving a big chunk of
production costs.

 By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Growing up, Elise Henning did all the right things.
She attended the Ethel Walker School, made her debut at the Junior
Assembly, spent her junior year in Geneva and graduated from Sarah
Lawrence College. When she returned to her parents' home in New
Canaan, Conn., she asked her father, a Wall Street commodities
trader, if she could go to law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elise, you don't need to go to law school,'' she recalls him
saying. ``Your brother does.'' His advice: ``Catch a good man, make
him happy and you'll be taken care of for the rest of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   That was almost 30 years ago, and Ms. Henning ended up marrying
a lawyer, settling with him in Palm Beach, Fla., and socializing in
all the right circles. She entertained, became active in the
Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea and had a daughter who
attended Palm Beach Day School.
</P>
<P>
   It was just as her father had said. Until her husband left,
moving to Vermont. He paid no child support after the divorce in
1992, she said, relating the story over iced tea at the Hotel
Carlyle.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting her status in life to change, and most important,
not wanting her daughter, who was 12 at the time, to feel deprived
in any way, she assessed her skills. She had never worked at
anything but entry-level ``glamour jobs,'' as she put it, but she
did have a knowledge of fine homes. (She and all her friends had
always lived in them.) She knew how to entertain and dress
tastefully, and she had many rich and socially connected friends.
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Henning became a real estate broker at Martha A.
Gottfried Inc., selling luxury properties to the social and the
trying-to-be-social. By night, she was a Palm Beach party planner,
helping women create ``beautiful parties'' for around $200 a guest.
(By telephone, she helped her daughter with homework). ``I was so
out there, networking, meeting more people,'' she said. ``The jobs
gave me an income, access and a great reason, as a single woman,
for being at all the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henning, who has since moved to Manhattan to sell real
estate at the upscale Stribling &AMP; Associates, went the classic
employment route of upper-class former wives _ both divorced and
widowed _ in their 40s and 50s. Reared to expect husbands to be
their providers, they are left without careers of their own, and
usually with a financial settlement too meager to maintain the life
they are accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   But many can turn to careers in glossy fields for which their
particular credentials _ high-maintenance tastes and a network of
rich and socially connected friends _ make them ideally suited.
These include luxury real-estate sales, interior decorating, event
planning and ``client liaison'' at the Sotheby's or Christie's
auction houses, where they help the best clients decide what to buy
and which of their houses to put it in.
</P>
<P>
   A not-so-incidental benefit of these glamour jobs is that they
put women in the right circles to meet the next multimillionaire
husband, if that's what they have in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Simone, 44, a man about town with homes in Manhattan and
Greenwich, Conn., has dated many such women. ``My first line is,
`Are you a real estate broker or a decorator?''' he said, laughing.
``They always say, `I'm a real estate broker, but I was a
decorator. How did you know?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sugar Rautbord, a socialite author in Palm Beach, said the
upper-class divorcee has two options (neither including the
possibility, exercised by at least some women, of returning to
college or professional school to prepare for a new career). For
one, she can go to Sotheby's. ``That's where part of the mythic
lure is that you sit behind the desk or have some knowledge of
French antiquities, and a gentlemen will materialize in front of
you, purchase a catalog and ask for your hand in marriage,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Option 2 is to sell real estate. She recalled that a
``multi-asseted single man'' she knows was home-shopping in Palm
Beach, where an army of leggy, attractive divorcees was competing
over him. One day, she said, he called a broker he had been working
with, and a colleague said the woman was out of the office with a
terminal illness, but she would be happy to take him to dinner.
``The first broker had a dentist's appointment!'' said Ms.
Rautbord, whose latest novel, ``The Chameleon'' (Warner Books,
1999), is about a middle-aged woman who changes her life and moves
on by remarrying.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the difficulties of re-entering the dating world and
the workplace are common to all divorced women whose husbands
supported them, regardless of economic status. A 1996 study in the
American Sociological Review found that women's standard of living
after divorce fell 27 percent, while men's rose 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Lenore Weitzman, the author of ``The Divorce Revolution: The
Unexpected Social and Economic Consequences for Women and Children
in America'' (Free Press/Macmillan, 1986), said the economic slide
for stay-at-home wives from affluent households is greater than
average, because there is such a discrepancy between what the
husband made and what the wife can earn.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the ladies-who-lunch set, in divorce they end up with a
skimpier lunch than when they started,'' said Raoul Felder, the
celebrity divorce lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the glamour job. The access to financial information about
home buyers _ and, in the New York world of co-op sales, social and
personal references _ makes luxury real estate sales the most
popular field for the once and hopeful wealthy wife. (For those who
might not be in it to stalk a husband, of course, it doesn't hurt
that the work can pay quite handsomely.) Taylor Stein, an owner of
the clubby Brown's restaurant on the Upper East Side, who used to
sell real estate at William B. May, said: ``Think about it: When
you get a customer who calls and he tells you he's looking for an
apartment that is $5 million, guess what, he's rich enough for you.
And if it's a co-op, you have access to the most intensely personal
information _ W-2's, reference letters.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henning agrees, to a point. ``The application still doesn't
tell you about his character, his values,'' she said. You also have
to sniff around, maybe look up divorce records. ``If the guy is
from Darien, go up to Darien and read the circumstances of the
divorce,'' she said. That way you won't end up, like one friend of
hers, dating a man with excellent financial references who was also
cross-dressing in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henning, who is in her early 50s, has gone out on a date or
two with men she met through her jobs, but ``nothing's worked
out,'' she said. Either they didn't ask her out again, or they
didn't live up to her expectations, which are high. ``When they ask
me to pay half the check,'' she said, ``I cross them off my list.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is also the problem of dealing with the towering egos of
the middle-aged bachelors some women in New York refer to as ``the
billionaire boys' club.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henning recalled dating a retired executive worth $80
million who was used to people's bowing and scraping. ``He had a
level of self-absorption that was scary,'' she said. ``When I would
talk, he would say `shut up.' He would only relate as if I were a
corporate secretary.'' She made him a needlepoint pillow that said,
``It ain't easy being king,'' then ended the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Pearson, a divorced woman in her 40s who still looks a bit
like the cheerleader she was in college, also has high standards.
She would be thrilled to fall in love with a man with five houses
and a horse farm, though she acknowledged she would make do with
less: ``I just want a country house.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pearson, who was divorced in her 20s, bounced around in some
not-so-glamorous jobs _ as an art director for CBS, then for Hearst
magazines _ before landing in the bona fide glamour field of
decorating. ``At CBS, I was working so hard, weekends, nights, I
never met anyone externally,'' she said. ``I sat at my desk all the
time. It was not the right existence, so I quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pearson said that in 1997, she ran into a handsome, recently
divorced man at a fund-raiser for the very social Henry Street
Settlement. He was moving from Greenwich, Conn., to Manhattan and
asked her to help him find an apartment and to decorate it. She
found a place on the Upper East Side for him, then moved in with
him and started to decorate. The relationship was moving along _
she had met his family, and had even gone camping with his mother _
but just as the window treatments were delivered, her beau said the
relationship was too serious and asked her to move out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I had finished my job,'' she said ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ms. Pearson said, she has a rule not to date clients. Or at
least not until her work is finished. It is part of the courtship
dance between the glamorous working woman and the wealthy bachelor
_ a working relationship full of moments of professional intimacy,
which allow the rare bloom and the buzzing bee to size one another
up.
</P>
<P>
   R. Couri Hay, a society columnist for Hamptons magazine, said
that all of the men and women who meet this way have something the
other wants. ``These women are looking for an American
billionaire,'' he said, ``and a man wants glamour, prestige, social
connections that he doesn't have. A man who has money and doesn't
have class wants to get himself a glamour girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steve Pearlman, 43, a plastic surgeon, was a client of Ms.
Pearson's, though they never dated. But he has gone out with a real
estate broker who showed him apartments. He said a man can learn a
lot about a potential mate in such professional encounters. ``You
see their taste, their attention to detail, their attention to
budget,'' he said. ``Are they realistic? Are they frivolous?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pearson's white-blonde hair and trim figure (she works out
three or four times a week) mark her as virtually the universal
type among the glamorous divorced women of the Upper East Side. She
and many others tend to favor a uniform of Adolfo and Chanel at
lunch, classic 18-karat jewelry and, for lounging with friends,
white cotton blouses that seem chosen so the buttons gape slightly
across the chest. Most look far younger than their years, an effect
achieved through meticulous grooming and, in many cases, the magic
of a surgeon's knife.
</P>
<P>
   They are well aware that in looking for romance with men their
age, they are competing with women a decade or two younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard,'' says Mary Meehan, a stunning blonde from Dallas,
crossing her long legs on a blue velvet Louis XV couch in her New
York apartment. ``Men in their 50s ... there aren't that many for
us 50-year-olds.'' She is a student of the fashionable theories of
evolutionary psychology. ``Men are instinctively drawn to young
women of childbearing age, and women are drawn to men who can take
care of them, with power,'' she said. ``It's instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meehan, who has been divorced four times, is a decorator who
works and socializes hard. (Nina Griscom and Dr. Dan Baker are
close friends.) She only takes decorating jobs for $500,000 and up.
In her own apartment, a modernist white box, she spent many hours
adding moldings and gilding, and upholstering the walls to give it
the look of a European chateau.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned my work ethic in my 40s,'' she said. ``I wish I had
it in my 20s.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up with wealthy parents, Ms. Meehan thought she would
never have to work. ``Proper young ladies got married,'' she said.
Her first husband hunted and fished, she said, living off inherited
money. After her latest divorce, from Michael Meehan, a former
partner at Salomon Brothers, he got the Southampton house, and
their nine-room apartment on East 72nd Street was sold to satisfy
the settlement terms.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meehan traded down to a two-bedroom apartment on Park
Avenue, and she had to go to work nearly full-time. Fortunately,
her life of privilege had given her exquisite taste. At 19, her
father sent her, her mother and a sister to Paris to shop for
antiques for a year. Her decorating projects have been published in
Architectural Digest, which has won her the attention of bachelors,
though not always the most ideal ones. After publication, she said,
she received letters from men in prison _ avid readers of the
magazine, it turned out.

</P>
<P>
   At Park Avenue tea parties, the popular theory is that a
divorced woman has five years from the time her settlement comes
through to meet the next husband.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline reflects the reality of modern divorce, which
rarely grants a woman long-term alimony. Most states, including New
York, award ``equitable distribution'' of assets in a divorce,
which means a greater share goes to the bigger contributor; wives
often receive a lump sum.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the richest, most high-profile women can find the
financial carpet pulled out from under them. After her divorce from
the billionaire Henry Kravis, Carolyne Roehm lost his backing for
the fashion company she ran, so she took flower-arranging classes
to prepare for a new career writing books about flowers. ``I went
from running seven houses to running one, my own,'' Ms. Roehm said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara de Portago said there is a difference between the hard
economic reality of the divorced woman and the myth of ``the
divorcee, with that first accent on the e.'' Being a divorcee, she
said, ``means that you're heavily subsidized by the former husband,
swathed in haute couture _ you're bejeweled. Of course, a divorcee
has no children, is massaged in oil and is lolling about on the
French Riviera or Gstaad.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. de Portago, thrice divorced, wouldn't mind being such a
figure. Instead, she works for glamorous employers _ Sotheby's,
Christian Dior and the Versailles Foundation _ largely trading on
the taste and connections acquired during a life in the beau monde.
``My work is all social,'' she said, mostly ``conducted over
lunch'' _ La Grenouille, Le Cirque 2000, Le Bernardin.
</P>
<P>
   Over Evian at the Pierre, Ms. de Portago said she did not want
to talk about her three former husbands (Anthony de Portago, a son
of Carroll Petrie; Jason Grant, a playwright, and William Tabert,
an investment banker), but she was happy to talk about work. As a
consultant to Christian Dior, which supplies her with a wardrobe,
she entices friends to buy the house's clothes. She gives a lunch
twice a year at Le Cirque for 150 women, all of whom must wear
Dior.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. de Portago grew up in the palace of Versailles. Truly. Her
stepfather, Gerald Van der Kemp, was the curator.
</P>
<P>
   At Sotheby's, where she works in client relations, she advises
new customers _ many of them newly wealthy _ on what and how to buy
at auction. She said that men fly her to their country homes,
introduce her to more people and, oh yes, sometimes propose
marriage. ``They say, `Please marry me, Barbara _ you could be such
an asset to me,''' she said, then added, ``There are so many men
out there, but no one I want yet.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Henning, the real estate broker who moved to New York
from Palm Beach, encouraged her daughter, Cornelia, now 19, to make
her debut at the Junior Assembly, she is now warning her not to
follow her own example of neglecting a career and marrying for
security. Two years ago, after Cornelia left for Vanderbilt
University in Nashville, Tenn., she called home and said, ``Mom,
all the girls here want is their M.R.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, Ms. Henning brought her daughter to Manhattan and
urged her to enroll at New York University, where she is now
studying filmmaking.

<P>
   Call them what you will _ natural, illegitimate, by-blows or
that Old French word, bastard _ children produced outside the
marriage aren't just showing up on the covers of magazines, cradled
by beaming Hollywood moms. They are also being outed in
publications that kept out-of-wedlock children firmly swept under
the Savonnerie.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the new edition of Burke's Peerage and Baronetage, the
106th edition of a studbook of titled Britons that was first
published in 1826. Weighing it at 16 pounds, the two-volume
directory _ which was published last month and is available through
Fitzroy Dearborn in Chicago for $395 _ has something it never had
before: a whiff of tabloid journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Bound in scarlet cotton, the genealogies compiled in its 3,400
pages now include all children, legitimate or not. The Earl of
Snowdon, who was once married to Princess Margaret, is listed,
along with his present wife, Lucy, their 19-year-old daughter,
Frances, and, surprisingly, his year-old son, Jasper, from the
liaison of Lord Snowdon, 69, and the 36-year-old daughter of a
baronet.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist peer and beer heir Baron Moyne, a k a Jonathan
Guinness, is joined by his wife of 35 years, Suzanne, and his five
children _ and a son and two daughters by an extramarital
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan night life fixture Anthony Haden-Guest, 62, is
now, officially, identified as the eldest, though illegitimate,
child of his late father, the fourth Baron Haden-Guest. Since
Haden-Guest's parents did not marry until two years after his
birth, the barony went to his younger and legitimately born brother
Christopher, who is now married to Jamie Leigh Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   Haden-Guest appreciates the belated recognition, though he
considers hereditary titles, especially in an aristocracy riddled
with questions of paternity, ``a charming irrelevance.'' Still, he
said: ``I'm delighted, because I loved my father, so I'm glad it's
in black and white. But as for it's significance? Hell, I live in
New York, not England.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke's typeface may be tiny but the information is like ``Hard
Copy'' in ``Masterpiece Theater'' guise. A baron's son whose
Iranian companion may not be his legal wife, Burke's says flatly,
is in any event, the mother of his child. Lady Cosima
Vane-Tempest-Stewart is identified as the ``nominal'' daughter of
the present Marquess of Londonderry _ though with milady's caveat,
quoted in the book, that she ``claims that Robin Douglas-Home,'' a
politician who died in 1968, is her biological father.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this blunt honesty, Charles Mosley, the book's editor in
chief, said, ``We have a lot of information on people that we would
never publish.'' He mentioned prison sentences and drug addictions.
But when it comes to genealogical news, he added, ``if it appears
in the press, and there is no denial of the fact, we will put it in
the text.'' This was the case with Lord Snowdon's son by Melanie
Cable-Alexander, an editor of the tony British magazine Country
Life.
</P>
<P>
   Burke's sent a draft of its entry to Snowdon with his youngest
child included, and he raised no objection, Mosley said. This is
standard procedure for all potentially touchy entries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curiously, we've got no complaints about listing an
illegitimate child,'' Mosley said. ``But some people have been
annoyed that we're listing someone they wish they could forget,''
like an ex-wife or former son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, many of the world's top society directories, including
the Social Register in the United States, have been participating
in this quiet, well-mannered revolution. Children whose names do
not normally make it into public announcements are showing up,
albeit discreetly, in these social reference books.
</P>
<P>
   Burke's competitor, Debrett's, has listed bastard children for
``15 years or so, but we haven't made a great deal of it,'' said
its editor, Charles Kidd. ``Lord Moyne, for instance, had written
at considerable length about his second family in a magazine or
newspaper article, so it was public knowledge,'' he added. ``He
obviously considered them part of his family, so we wrote to him,
asking if he objected to our including them.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyne apparently did not hesitate, though three telephone calls
last week to his London home were not answered. Neither were three
calls to Snowdon's studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``One or two dowagers may have been a bit shocked at first,''
Kidd said. ``But times have changed so radically in the last 20
years that even the older generation is quite accepting. So it was
quite impossible for us to stand by the old policy of not including
natural children.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Social Register, a New York publication popularly
regarded as staid to the point of inertia, can be a
reading-between-the-lines delight for insiders. (Copies are $105
through written request to the Social Register Association, 381
Park Avenue South, New York 10016.)
</P>
<P>
   According to its spokesman, Thomas Lee Jones, the SR, as it is
called, listed its first out-of-wedlock birth in 1987, in its
births and deaths announcements at the front of each volume. Since
then, there has been at least one in every edition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people who read the book carefully, but it's not the
kind of thing that's touted,'' he added. However, the black book
with the distinctive tangerine racing stripes _ ``Social Register
orange,'' Jones said _ does not indulge in Burke's-style
exposition: just name of baby, date and place of birth, and,
occasionally, a grandparent's name rather than the unwed parents,
to cloak the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful,'' Letitia Baldrige, the
common-sensical etiquette doyenne, said from her office in
Washington. ``Children deserve to be recognized and given their
status. It's not their fault what goes on in the bedroom. Sure, the
acknowledgment might be tough on the family, but when you think of
that bastard child . . .'' _ Ms. Baldrige paused _ ``identification
is the kind and compassionate thing to do. It doesn't meant that
the child's relationship with the father's wife or other children
will be any easier. But it clears the air.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Gertrude Himmelfarb, the conservative historian who wrote ``The
De-Moralization of Society: From Victorian Virtues to Modern
Values,'' was not so sure that the listing of illegitimate children
in social registries was a sign of progress. ``What can I say _
it's a sign of times,'' she said, laughing. ``It means they've
bought into the counterculture.''
</P>
<P>
   But the august Almanach de Gotha is adamantly against this
trend. Largely devoted to chronicling the noble families of
Continental Europe, the Gotha recently resumed production after a
55-year hiatus. Published in London by Almanach de Gotha Ltd., the
1999 edition is $110 and can be ordered through bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the parents can't be bothered to integrate illegitimate
children into the family, I don't see why we should do the job for
them,'' said John Kennedy, the editor. He makes a distinction
between legal and verbal acknowledgment of an out-of-wedlock child.
This explains why the Gotha did not publish the name of the
illegitimate son of Prince Konstantin von Schaumberg-Lippe until
this year's edition, after he legally adopted the child, Oliver,
who is now 11. The prince married the child's mother, Petra Maass,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he is legally the man's child, and properly recognized by
law,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bottin Mondain, since 1903 France's guide to its
officially defunct nobility, the situation is much the same. ``I
think I would say no'' to a request to list an illegitimate child,
said its manager, Blanche de Kersaint. ``The parents must be a
legally married couple,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   As for the issue of listing a same-sex couple _ say, the
hypothetical Vicomte de Pamplemousse and his male companion of 30
years _ Mrs. de Kersaint was apologetic but unyielding: ``It's
impossible to write them together. It's a rule of the house. They
would have to be separate. At the same address, yes, but not the
same listing.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, said Martine de Forges, the book's public-relations
officer, the Vicomte de Pamplemousse's companion would have to come
equipped with recommendations from two Bottin Mondain members, just
like any new applicant. (Copies of the Bottin Mondain can be
ordered from its office in Paris: -(33-1) 44.51.13.13.)
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the century, same-sex couples often appeared
together in the thin pages of the Social Register, though cloaked
under innocuous Edwardianism: two unrelated ladies living at the
same address, like the decorator Elsie de Wolfe and her companion,
Elisabeth Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is so `in your face' now, but back then, everything
was more subtle, which allowed that kind of thing,'' said Jones,
who is also the editor and publisher of the SR's sister, a smart
and sassy society magazine called The Observer.
</P>
<P>
   Male couples living together have also appeared, sometimes
together, though usually divided by the alphabet, separate but
equal. ``Ultimately, joint listings are the next step for all of
us,'' Jones added.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he said, the Social Register received a request from a
woman who wanted her female companion jointly listed. ``So I sent
the mate a form, like we do for a man or woman who wants his or her
spouse in the book,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The news of that same-sex application was welcomed by Ms.
Baldrige. ``Providing it's a longtime union, and a serious
relationship,'' she said, ``why not?''

GORDON LIGHTFOOT IS JUST `PASSING THROUGH' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOAN CROWDER   
 Santa Barbara, Calif., News-Press   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gordon Lightfoot's audiences are a mixed bag these days. Three
decades after the singer-songwriter's coffeehouse beginnings as a
stalwart of the folk era of the early '60s, his music is now pegged
as ``adult contemporary,'' Lightfoot said in a telephone interview
from his home in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we tour, there are always quite a few folkies in the
audience and there is a certain curiosity quotient.''
</P>
<P>
   Lightfoot and his backup musicians, currently on a month-long
tour, perform in concert about 50 times a year. ``We like to keep
the pressure on. There's not a man among us who doesn't love to
play,'' Lightfoot said.
</P>
<P>
   His band includes guitarist Terry Clements, bassist Rick Haynes,
keyboardist Mike Heffernan and drummer Barry Keane. They have been
his core group for several years. Lightfoot plays a variety of
acoustic guitars.
</P>
<P>
   The songs on the CD ``A Painter Passing Through,'' which was
released last year, have a strong autobiographical tone _ only
natural at this point in his life, Lightfoot said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Near the end game of the career, it's OK to reflect back on
what a time it's been. I turn 60 this year. I've settled down now
and I'm in the great position of being able to make my own albums.
I enjoy being able to have that ability to keep touring and keep
writing.''
</P>
<P>
   The title track, ``A Painter Passing Through,'' is the most
autobiographical, the songwriter said.
</P>
<P>
   The lyrics tell his story: ``I was in my stride, always at my
game/ here comes Mr. Cool, along the walk of fame/ I was in demand,
always in control/ The world was in my hands, my touch had turned
to gold.''
</P>
<P>
   But the refrain brings it into perspective: ``If you want to
know my secret don't come runnin' after me/ For I am just a painter
passing through in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Lightfoot has recorded 19 albums, but he's most excited about a
four-CD anthology that will be released in the fall by Rhino
Records, a division of Warner Bros., which has produced all but a
few of his earliest recordings. In addition to his well-known
songs, such as ``If You Could Read My Mind,'' ``Sundown,''
``Carefree Highway'' and ``Summertime Dream,'' the anthology will
include 16 previously unpublished songs. ``These are songs that
were cut from albums or were in demo stages previously,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   When he returns to Canada next month, Lightfoot will perform a
55-minute live anthology on a Toronto TV station.
</P>
<P>
   Lightfoot's songs have been recorded by an array of legendary
singers, including Bob Dylan, Peter, Paul and Mary and Barbra
Streisand. Marty Robbins had a hit with Lightfoot's ``Ribbon of
Darkness'' and Elvis Presley with ``Early Morning Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   A dance club cover of ``If You Could Read My Mind,'' which was a
hit in the early '70s, was on Volume 2 of the soundtrack of the
movie ``Studio 54'' last year and ended up on the charts again, he
noted. ``It was even on the charts in Europe. It was No. 1 in
Spain. For some reason, the movie didn't do too well, but the song
sure did.''
</P>
<P>
   Lightfoot's sound has changed with the times. Although the
lyrics on ``A Painter Passing Through'' have the personal tone of
his earlier folk songs, the musical mix is contemporary and the
beat more lively. Lightfoot says he has mixed feelings about the
technical quality of his early recordings, and he takes the blame.
In those days, he eschewed the refined, big studio sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would go in with our own little unit to retain our identity
by trying to keep the folk-country sound. That was the intention,
but in many ways it ended up underproduced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He recorded five albums in four years in the late '60s and early
'70s, but then slowed down the pace. ``Your plate gets full, with
the responsibilities of family, and your work takes longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Lightfoot has been married twice, first in 1970 and again in
1989. He has six children. ``I keep in touch with everybody,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lightfoot's long career has had its ups and downs. In the late
'80s he went through a period of reflection on both his music and
his life, he said, but he never dropped out of sight. ``There was a
time when I threatened to stop, but it became a rumor, so I changed
my attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   He tried acting but is his own worst critic. ``I didn't like
what I saw,'' he said. ``I took a couple of shots at it, with Bruce
Dern in `Harry Tracy' and on TV's `Hotel' with James Brolin and
Connie Selleca, where I played an itinerant country musician.
Brolin was a good director and it was a lot of fun, but I'm not
going to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Lightfoot has received five Grammy nominations and 17 Juno
Awards, the Canadian Grammy. In 1997, he received Canada's Governor
General's Award for ``international efforts in spreading Canadian
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   His music has ranged ``up and down the musical totem pole,'' he
noted. ``My recent work is classified as adult contemporary, though
some people still refer to me as a folkie. But I've had stuff in
the mainstream and in the country field, so I guess I'm in the
middle somewhere, but anywhere on a totem pole in this business is
fine by me.''

`THE GREAT BOMB HEIST' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 27, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal government last week began administering polygraph
tests to the first of around 5,000 nuclear weapons scientists and
other employees in sensitive positions as part of its campaign
against Chinese espionage, according to The Washington Post. The
process is expected to take four years.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time the ``lie detector'' has been used for
widespread screening outside the CIA and the National Security
Agency. The defense and telecommunications industries, merely
baffled when the fracas began two years ago over Chinese launches
of US satellites, today are genuinely upset. With China's
application to join the World Trade Organization in jeopardy, the
entire corporate establishment is involved.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the CIA is advertising for recruits, 35 or younger,
to its clandestine service. Qualities sought include an adventurous
spirit, forceful personality, superior intellect, tough-mindedness,
integrity, courage and patriotism. ``You will need to deal with
fast-moving, ambiguous and unstructured situations that will test
your resourcefulness to the utmost,'' say the ads.
</P>
<P>
   A central premise of those who worry about China is that there
exists a close analogy with the early days of the Cold War _ that
the famous ``W-88'' warhead plans obtained by the Chinese confer
the same sort of advantage as the blueprints that enabled the
Russians in the late 1940s to produce a perfect copy of one of the
first US bombs, a year or two earlier than a working bomb could
have been assembled independently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feed the benchmarks into the codes on the supercomputer and _
presto! _ the People's Liberation Army leaps a decade ahead in its
race to nuclear weapon parity,'' writes William Safire, the New
York Times columnist who more than any other commentator brought
the crisis to a boil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential damage is on a magnitude of the Fuchs-Rosenberg
losses,'' says former Energy Department counterintelligence chief
Nola Trulock, invoking the names of Soviet spies who provided
information that may or may not have proved vital to the early
Soviet nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   What if they are right? To get back in the spirit of the 1950s,
I re-read ``The Torment of Secrecy: The Background and Consequences
of American Security Policies,'' by Edward A. Shils. It offers the
same kind of reliable field guide to Red scares as does Charles P.
Kindleberger's ``Manias, Panics and Crashes'' to financial bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   Shils, the great University of Chicago sociologist, was, in many
ways, the first and best ``neo-conservative.'' A figure of enormous
importance in the second half of the 20th century _ comparable to
the better-known political philosopher Isaiah Berlin _ he died at
the age of 84 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Shils wrote his book in 1956, when there wasn't the slightest
ambiguity about the threat posed by the Soviets _ that was the year
they crushed the Hungarian revolt. Without understating the dangers
in the least, he neverthless managed to untangle the many
mechanisms by which ``small bands of fantasy-obsessed extremists
spread thinly over many strata and professions'' managed to
precipitate the unpleasantness of the McCarthy era.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there were some pretty striking similarities between
then and now. The deeper sources of fear today are much the same as
those he identified: hyperpatriotism, xenophobia, isolationism,
fundamentalism, fear of revolution and populism. The paranoid style
_ ``the belief that the world is dominated by unseen circles of
conspirators, operating behind our backs''_ is unchanged. The
natural antagonism among politicians, bureaucrats, and
intellectuals still yields the various divisive alliances that are
inherent in any triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, motives are the same. Of the GOP in the early 1950s,
out of office for five presidential terms, Shils wrote, ``Passion
for office stirred the Republican soul, the blood ran more
vigorously in their veins as the thought of returning to power
became more immediate and more plausible to them. They became
ravenous. So long out of power and so close to it! Anything short
of insurrection might have appealed to many Republicans as a way of
getting back.''
</P>
<P>
   A mere eight years without the White House in the 1990s sufficed
to produced an impeachment drive.
</P>
<P>
   It's when you think about the differences between the early Cold
War and the present day that you begin to really wonder about the
judgment of those promoting the panic over Chinese espionage.
</P>
<P>
   For example, consider the wide diffusion of technology that has
occurred in the last 50 years. According to David Holloway,
director of Stanford University's Institute for International
Studies and author of ``Stalin and the Bomb,'' nuclear weapons
scientists at Los Alamos have been working closely with their
counterparts in the former Soviet Union, in large part in order to
prevent the impoverished Russians from selling their secrets to
willing buyers around the world. This arrangement now is endangered
by Congressional bullying.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the existence of this shadowy black market for nuclear
secrets is one plausible reason advanced for the central enigma
identified by the Cox Report on weapons spying. Why did China let
the CIA know they had stolen an important US secret? Just possibly,
Randolph Herber at Fermilab has ventured it was because China,
having gotten what it needed, wanted the United States to plug its
holes before the data leaked out to the next enterprising snoop.
</P>
<P>
   And as for computers? With the next generation of
over-the-counter personal computers about to exceed in power the
current limit for which a license currently is needed for sales to
China's military, it is simply silly to imagine that
number-crunching can be maintained as a meaningful constraint on
Chinese weapons shops. Says Robert L. Park, a commentator for the
American Physical Society, ``the discussion should return to the
hard reality _ you can't keep secrets forever so we better focus on
noproliferation and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the differences between the deeply integrated world of
the present day and the Iron Curtain world of the early 1950s are
so great that anyone so fixated on the past as to bring up Klaus
Fuchs and the Rosenbergs is simply not to be taken seriously.
There's no doubt that the Chinese are arming themselves, nor is it
unreasonable to expect that they should, though what direction
relations will take over the course of the next century is far from
clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Great Bomb Heist'' (the phrase is that of The National
Journal), like Whitewater and the Blue Dress, will enter the
history books as a ploy manufactured mainly by fractious
out-of-power Republicans. It is this crazy willingness to go to any
lengths to impugn the opposition that we must hope will be
diminished by the outcome by the next election or two. For as
Edward Shils wrote, ``A free society can exist only when public
spirit is balanced by an equal inclination of men to mind their own
business.''

FIVE FORT WORTH POLICE OFFICERS FIRED OVER MAN'S DEATH
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: May be updated with afternoon news conference) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By KATHY SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Police Chief Thomas Windham has fired five
officers accused of ``hogtying'' a man who died in their custody,
and the district attorney and the FBI are investigating whether
they committed crimes or civil rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   The officers violated many departmental orders, used excessive
force, lied, falsified documents and orchestrated a cover-up about
the hogtying, Windham wrote in letters to the city Civil Service
Commission. The Star-Telegram obtained copies of the documents.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the officers were placed on indefinite suspension without
pay _ tantamount to firing _ last week, and the other three were
terminated Wednesday for their treatment of Luis Enrique Hernandez,
31, who died New Year's Day while being arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``This death, coupled with the cover-up, is the most serious
thing that has happened in the Police Department since I've been
here,'' Windham, Fort Worth's chief for 14 years, said on
Wednesday. ``I have no explanation how this incident could have
occurred, and the subsequent cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers hid behind ``the so-called Blue Curtain or code of
silence,'' Windham wrote in the disciplinary letters. The death and
the officers' actions had the ``appearances of a classic case of
serious police misconduct,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The fired officers were identified as David N. Stefanos, 30, an
eight-year veteran; David P. Alkins, 27, commissioned in October
1995; Linn William Goodman, 27, an officer for slightly more than a
year; Hector Luis Melendez, 28, also with a year on the job; and
John R. ``John-John'' Ornelas, 25, an officer since December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Gilliland, a Police Explorer Post scout and police
academy applicant, is implicated in the cover-up. His application
to the academy has now been rejected, Windham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From all indications, these officers were good officers, and
the near-rookies, from all indications, were going to be good
officers,'' Windham said. ``The Explorer, they totally ruined him.
They included him in their cover-up. He even lied to
investigators.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers could not be reached for immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   Windham said he called U.S. Attorney Paul Coggins to ask the FBI
to investigate the possibility of civil rights violations by the
officers. He said a criminal case will be submitted to the Tarrant
County district attorney's office for review.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our presentations to the U.S. attorney and the district
attorney will determine whether there is sufficient evidence that
it (the officers' actions) contributed to the man's death or caused
it,'' Windham said.
</P>
<P>
   Coggins said the FBI, a prosecutor in the Justice Department's
civil rights division who is based in Washington, and a prosecutor
from his office have been assigned to the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have opened a civil rights investigation,'' Coggins said.
``The civil rights division is working with my office, and the FBI
is investigating the case now. As soon as the FBI finishes its
investigation, they'll forward it to us and we'll make a
determination as to whether charges will be filed.''
</P>
<P>
   The firings and investigations come two months after Hernandez's
family sued the city of Fort Worth, alleging that the officers used
excessive and unreasonable force in subduing Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Events leading to Hernandez's death began about 2:30 p.m. Jan.
1, when officer R.L. Hudson was dispatched to the 3200 block of
Hale Avenue to investigate a call saying that Hernandez had struck
a child, according to the documents.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who suffered from schizophrenia, and Hudson began
struggling inside the house. When Hudson tried to use pepper spray
on Hernandez, both became incapacitated, Windham said. Hudson then
called for backup and remained blinded by the spray until
firefighters arrived to treat his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson wasn't near the scene of the hogtying and had nothing to
do with the cover-up, Windham said.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, Stefanos, Alkins, Ornelas, Melendez and Gilliland, who
was riding with Ornelas, answered Hudson's call for assistance and
handcuffed Hernandez, leading him outside the house.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Hernandez continued to struggle. Stefanos, Alkins
and Goodman forced him to the ground, where restraints were placed
on his legs, according to the documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to Officers Alkins and Goodman, Officer Stefanos
told them to hog-tie Mr. Hernandez. Officer Alkins responded in
words to the effect that they couldn't do that, it was a General
Orders' violation,'' Windham's letters to the civil service say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officer Stefanos answered in words to the effect that it did
not matter, hog-tie him anyway. Officers Stefanos, Alkins and
Goodman then in a reckless manner conjointly placed Mr. Hernandez
in an unauthorized hog-tie restraint with Officer Stefanos being
the officer that connected the leg restraints to the handcuffs,''
Windham's letters said.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was left face-down in the street with a snap on the
leg restraints connected to the chain of the handcuffs, Windham
said. The snap is usually used to secure leg restraints to the
floorboard of a patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   Hogtying means to tie a person's bound feet and hands together
behind his or her back. It is specifically a violation of
department policy because in some cases, it has contributed to a
death, Windham said.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez became motionless and unconscious, and the officers
didn't respond to him other than to call for MedStar, the letters
say. Gilliland pointed out to Ornelas that Hernandez was neither
breathing nor responsive, but Ornelas left the prone man on the
street, pointing him out to MedStar attendants later, the letters
say.
</P>
<P>
   The restraints were finally removed at MedStar's request, but
Hernandez died soon. The cause of death was listed as cardiac
arrest and aspiration of gastric contents, but the manner of death
is still listed as undetermined, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors who saw the scuffle told investigators and reporters
that they had seen Hernandez hogtied, but the officers involved
repeatedly denied doing that, Windham said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Haskell, who with Richard Henderson sued the city on
behalf of Hernandez's family, said the disciplinary action against
the officers was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``My take on it is, this happened on a holiday; it was a bright,
sunny afternoon. There were a bunch of neighbors out, and they saw
what happened,'' Haskell said. ``We talked to the neighbors, and
they told us what went on. They said, `We wish we'd had a video
camera.' But they were the video camera. The Fort Worth Police
Department couldn't cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Rodney King without the video camera. It ended up
happening, and too many people saw it. It makes it look good for
the Police Department to take this action, and they had to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's sister, Gricelda Luna, said she believes that the
officers deserve to be fired ``because they did things they
shouldn't have. This way, they won't ever do what they did to my
brother again.''
</P>
<P>
   Luna was at home that day. She said she was forced outside when
she was overcome by pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
   Windham criticized the department's initial investigation and
pre-disciplinary review boards, saying too many questions had been
left unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reviewed that report, and there were so many loose ends, if
you were out in high winds, they would've beaten you to death,'' he
said. Many of the neighbors' reports that Hernandez had been
hogtied were apparently ignored or were not followed up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that man was hogtied was screaming at you, although
every officer had omitted it from his statement, denied it and was
untruthful about it,'' Windham said.
</P>
<P>
   He then ordered an Internal Affairs Division investigation,
which resulted in the firings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing lacking out there was a hero who would have
stood up and said: `No way are we going to do this. We are not
going to hogtie him,' '' Windham said. ``That hurts.''

   Walk into a bar. Find yourself a guy who is sitting with his hat
on backward, staring at the television on the wall. Good. That
means he's a sports fan. Sit down next to him. Let him have it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kareem Abdul-Jabbar could score all right but, face it, he's
no George Mikan.''
</P>
<P>
   The guy laughs so hard his tonsils touch his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Aw, just for the heck of it, keep it going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry Sanders can jiggle around a tackler but, boy, he ain't
Red Grange.''
</P>
<P>
   The guy falls off his stool and asks his friends to gather
around.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger Clemens can throw hard but, come on, everyone knows
he'll never be Walter Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   The guy will climb back on his stool, take a sip and then look
at you as if you just translated the Dead Sea Scrolls. You will
never be treated with more respect, never thought to be more
intelligent ... and you have just perpetuated a most unique sports
myth and you didn't even know it.
</P>
<P>
   In every other sport BUT baseball, we take it for granted the
athletes have become bigger, stronger, faster and quicker over the
years, that they can throw, jump, catch, run and crush skulls
better than they did, say, a half-century ago. Better medicine and
better nutrition produce a better product. Your basic athletic
algebraic formula.
</P>
<P>
   Except for baseball. We love its past so much we never want to
leave it, so we ignore reality.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, we received more evidence of that.
</P>
<P>
   The Society of American Baseball Research (SABR) announced the
100 Greatest Players of the 20th Century. Not one current player is
listed among the top 33, and only nine players still active are on
the list at all. In the top 10, for example, the most recent player
is Hank Aaron (fourth), who retired 23 years ago. In the top 25,
there are only two players who played in the last 16 years, Mike
Schmidt (16th) and Johnny Bench (19th).
</P>
<P>
   The message is obvious. Today's baseball is not worth a good
diddly. No one can play a lick these days. That line of thinking,
however, skips a few basic facts that should make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of those top 25 players never played against
African-Americans and Latinos. Twelve of those 25 never had to play
a bulk of their season under the lights. Fifteen of those 25 never
had to fly across country to play games. Sixteen of those 25 never
had to play in an era when games were set up for a dominant relief
pitcher. Nineteen of those top 25 players never played in the
godforsaken numbers-numbing life-threatening Astrodome, or some
other dome nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Meaning, there was a lot Tris Speaker (23) and Grover Alexander
(25) and Christy Mathewson (13) and Honus Wagner (10) and Rogers
Hornsby (9) missed. They missed the best competition because they
missed playing the best people in the most adverse conditions
tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   None of that it matters. Baseball historians always have become
misty-eyed when looking through the rearview mirror at the sport's
past. So many homespun homilies and florid poems have been penned
in baseball's name, all of it programming us into believing
baseball is America's soul, and please get out the hanky, well, we
don't want to leave warm and fuzzy for...
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ain't startin', I ain't departin''' was how Padres
shortstop Garry Templeton described his non-participation in an
All-Star Game. Yes, self-indulgence, no matter what the activity,
always comes with a price tag. If it's food consumed, it's a
waistline ready to zoom. If it's alcohol swallowed, it's Betty Ford
to follow. If it's pedal-to-the-floor, it's Officer Friendly
leaning against the driver's door. And if it's a pompous athlete
showing his feathers, then eventually he'll find bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   This is the bad weather. The people are exercising their opinion
by pushing the current players to the back of the bus, if they are
allowed on the bus at all. The game is not warm and fuzzy anymore.
It is a game of monopoly they are playing, not baseball, and so Ken
Griffey Jr. _ one of the top 10 talents in ALL of baseball history
_ shut up and take your place back there at No. 53. Grif, you're
not even good enough to beat out catcher Mickey Cochrane (50) and
his 119 homers and .323 average.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of sports? It can get bigger, faster, stronger, and no
one would dare claim Mikan could hold his own against Abdul-Jabbar
or that Red Grange could run for 150 yards against the Packers.
It's physical evolution, after all. Except baseball. In this sport,
you still want to believe Walter Johnson (11) is better than Roger
Clemens (34), even though Walter retired in 1927 in the midst of
the dead-ball era and Roger is still humping peas past moonballers.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball never changes. It's still a ball and a bat and a glove.
You could put Ty Cobb up there at the plate today, and he'd still
hit .400. Really. Honest. No kidding. Even with that ugly big bat
of his. And you resist questioning that logic every time you hear a
player today yapping. You stop clapping and send him all the way to
No. 65, which is where SABR put Barry Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball never changes. You can compare 1920 and 1990. It's the
same game. Really. Honest. No kidding. It's still a ball and a bat
and a glove. And as long as you believe in that, let's take a ride
in my space shuttle I have parked out back and I'll tell you why
Addie Joss was No. 99 and a better pitcher than Pedro Martinez.

TAKING A HOLOCAUST SKEPTIC SERIOUSLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By D.D. GUTTENPLAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Can a writer who thinks the Holocaust was a hoax still
be a great historian?
</P>
<P>
   The British writer David Irving's books have been praised by
some of the most eminent scholars in his field. The military
historian John Keegan, who says Irving ``knows more than anyone
alive about the German side of the Second World War,'' considers
his work ``indispensable to anyone seeking to understand the war in
the round.'' Gordon Craig, a leading scholar of German history at
Stanford University, also calls Irving's work ``indispensable.'' He
adds, ``I always learn something from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet to Deborah Lipstadt, author of ``Denying the Holocaust,''
Irving is a propagandist _ ``one of the most dangerous
spokespersons for Holocaust denial'' _ and not a historian at all.
It is a statement that has prompted Irving to sue her for libel in
Britain. He readily admits that he has said ``there were never any
gas chambers at Auschwitz,'' but insists he is not a Holocaust
denier because his comments ``are true.''
</P>
<P>
   The case, which goes to trial here early next year, does more
than raise the issue of free speech and test the evenhandedness of
British libel laws; it poses disturbing questions about the
practice of history.
</P>
<P>
   There is some irony in Irving's legal action. In 1996, St.
Martin's Press, under public pressure, canceled a contract with
Irving for his book, ``Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich.''
His defenders assailed St. Martin's, arguing they were trying to
muzzle his views. The Goebbels biography never did find an American
publisher, but a London edition, brought out by Irving's own
imprint, prompted Craig to declare: ``Silencing Mr. Irving would be
a high price to pay for freedom from the annoyance he causes us.
The fact is that he knows more about National Socialism than most
professional scholars in his field.''
</P>
<P>
   In a six-page essay in The New York Review of Books, Craig noted
Irving's claims that the Holocaust never took place, and that
Auschwitz was merely ``a labor camp with an unfortunately high
death rate.'' Though ``such obtuse and quickly discredited views''
may be ``offensive to large numbers of people,'' Craig argued,
Irving's work is ``the best study we have of the German side of the
Second World War,'' and ``we dare not'' disregard his views.
</P>
<P>
   Yet is it contradictory to describe Irving, as the writer
Christopher Hitchens has, as ``not just a Fascist historian'' but
also ``a great historian of Fascism''?
</P>
<P>
   Irving's claim to historical seriousness rests largely, in
Craig's phrase, on ``his energy as a researcher.'' An indefatigable
documents man, Irving spent years poring over Nazi archives,
rooting out long-lost diaries and private correspondence and
presenting his findings in vivid, readable narratives aimed at
conveying World War II from the German point of view.
</P>
<P>
   That effort has earned praise from many historians who are at
pains to distinguish between the historian and the work. Eric
Hobsbawm, the British Marxist historian, declared that Irving's
politics were irrelevant. ``Most historians are politically engaged
one way or another,'' he said. ``You judge what they do not by the
political intent, but by whether they produce work based on
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mazower, a historian at Princeton University, pointed out
that ``if you restricted yourself to works produced in conditions
of freedom, by writers with whom we can feel intellectually akin,''
you would be ruling out a lot of history. The real question, said
Mazower, author of ``Dark Continent: Europe's 20th Century,'' is
how you treat such material. ``After all, even the Nazi historians
produced some useful information.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar observation could be heard from Raul Hilberg, author
of the classic ``Destruction of the European Jews.'' ``I have
quoted Eichmann references that come from a neo-Nazi publishing
house,'' he told Hitchens in an article that appeared in Vanity
Fair during the St. Martin's controversy. ``I am not for taboos.''
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, these scholars recognize that it is absurd to
expect historians to operate in a sanitized, value-free
environment. Michael Geyer, professor of contemporary European
history at the University of Chicago, said that Irving's values are
responsible for the ultimately debilitating flaws in his work.
</P>
<P>
   Geyer, who specializes in military history, argues that Irving's
very success in ``understanding the Nazi generals as they were''
brings its own pitfalls. First, there is the problem of
consistency. ``If you want to stay within the purview of the Nazis,
you have to reconstruct what they did,'' Geyer explained in a
telephone interview. ``You can't just ignore some of what they did
because it doesn't fit your point of view. Irving shuts down
sources that do not suit his point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, said Geyer, Irving ``does not keep all the actors
in the picture.'' In his fascination with the Nazis, he overlooks
the humanity of their victims. A good historian, said Geyer, needs
empathy as well as intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   David Cannadine, director of London's Institute for Historical
Research, has also criticized Irving's ``double standard on
evidence.'' Reviewing the first volume of Irving's 1988 book
``Churchill's War,'' he accused Irving of ``demanding absolute
documentary proof to convict the Germans (as when he sought to show
that Hitler was not responsible for the Holocaust), while relying
on circumstantial evidence to condemn the British (as in his
account of the Allied bombing of Dresden).''
</P>
<P>
   Hilberg is well aware of the pressure to conform to an approved
Holocaust narrative. His own work has been attacked in some
quarters for the minimal role he allots to Jewish resistance. But
while Hilberg defends Irving's right to publish, he distinguishes
Irving's writing from ``legitimate controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the freedom not to be responsible,'' Hilberg has
said, ``but that doesn't mean I endorse it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, he said in a telephone interview, numerous continuing
disputes among Holocaust scholars. For example, some say Hitler
always intended to murder the Jews, while others say he did so
partly in response to the fortunes of war. ``Exact numbers,
resistance _ there are still disagreements,'' Hilberg said. ``But
to ignore evidence that points to certain conclusions _ to claim
there were no gas chambers at Auschwitz for killing people! That is
not a legitimate controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   To Hilberg, Irving's record as a collector of facts is beside
the point: ``You can create an illusion that is totally misleading
by leaving things out, even though everything you say is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving himself insists he is not a historian of the Holocaust.
``I regard myself principally as a biographer of top Nazis (and
others),'' he communicated electronically from his house in Key
West, Fla. Asked for his response to some recent scholarship
setting out the mechanism of Hitler's Final Solution, Irving
replied: ``Haven't read it. It's not my patch.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, he distributes a widely discredited book purporting to
disprove the existence of the gas chambers. And he insists that
while Nazi memoirs may be taken essentially at face value, the
testimony of Holocaust survivors is relatively worthless.
``Eyewitness testimony,'' he said in a speech last year at
Washington State University, ``is really a matter for psychiatric
evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   It is sentiments like these that prompted Ms. Lipstadt to warn
historians and journalists away from Irving's work. That warning,
Irving said, led to his troubles with St. Martin's _ and to his
decision to sue.
</P>
<P>
   To get to court in the United States, a public figure like
Irving would have to show that Ms. Lipstadt had acted ``in reckless
disregard'' of the truth. But British libel law is different. Here,
``the burden of proof is on the defendant,'' said Anthony Julius,
Ms. Lipstadt's lawyer. ``We have to prove that what she said was
true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm living in `Alice in Wonderland,''' Ms.
Lipstadt said in a telephone interview. ``It's absolutely
backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt awkward about resorting to the courts to
silence his critics after he had been the cause of a free-speech
campaign, Irving replied, ``It may be unfortunate for Professor
Lipstadt that she is the one who finds herself dragged out of the
line and shot.''
</P>
<P>
   So is David Irving a historian? The question is ``a little
artificial,'' said Mazower, the ``Dark Continent'' author. ``On
whom do we bestow the hallowed title of historian?''
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, where Holocaust denial is a crime, Irving has been
convicted and fined for his views. But Britain, like the United
States, has no such law. In her book, Ms. Lipstadt advised against
using courts to suppress even those who would deny the existence of
the gas chambers. ``Legal restraints,'' she wrote, ``transform the
deniers into martyrs on the altars of free speech.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to a British judge to decide whether that label
fits either side in this case.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A heat wave will begin to build from the central Plains to New
England as sultry air streams northeastward on balmy breezes.
Clouds and thundershowers will continue to dominate the South. A
push of chilly air from the Pacific will spread farther inland
across the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure will strengthen over the western Atlantic, and its
broad circulation will draw tropical air into the eastern half of
the nation. A corridor of sunny skies stretching from the Northeast
across the Great Lakes and into the western Plains will promote
temperatures above 90 degrees. Relative to seasonal levels,
northern New England should be the warmest.
</P>
<P>
   One disturbance will drift off the South Carolina coast while
another area of disturbed weather organizes over the western Gulf
Coast. Clouds will be abundant in the Southeast and the western
part of the lower Mississippi Valley. Weak winds, as light as 10
miles an hour, will be noted to 40,000 feet over the Deep South.
This will contribute to sluggish storms that may produce flash
flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of thunderstorms will drench south central Canada, and
a few will develop in the Dakotas and northern Minnesota as low
pressure treks eastward. The boundary with cooler air over the
northern Rockies will become active with a few storms in the
northwest Plains and eastern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   The clouds over the Pacific Northwest will dissipate inland, but
onshore breezes will keep it dull and rather cool near the Coast.
High pressure near Oregon will turn the winds offshore in
California Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Rope Tornado
</P>
<P>
   A tornado in the form of a rope was spotted near Amarillo,
Texas, on Thursday. Such a ``rope tornado,'' which extends to the
ground from the base of the parent thunderstorm, is a visual clue
that the tornado is in its decaying stage. Indeed, as the parent
thunderstorm pulls away, the tornado is stretched into a funnel
that resembles a rope. Eventually, however, the tornado is
streched into oblivion. Though the rope stage of a tornado heralds
its imminent demise, the tornado can still be dangerous. After the
tornado dies, the parent thunderstorm may spawn another twister.

DISGRUNTLED CONSERVATIVES FORM NEW SOUTHERN PARTY 
 HELPING SOUTHERN FARMERS  
 GOP ATTORNEYS GENERAL UNITE  
 CONSERVING THE REEFS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: The South)  (mk) 
 By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The South will rise again.
</P>
<P>
   That, anyway, is the goal of a group of conservative activists
who are calling for a sovereign Southern nation and have formed a
new political party to promote the interests of the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tired of the federal government telling us our heritage
is wrong, our beliefs are wrong,'' said Jerry Baxley, Virginia
state chairman for the new Southern Party. Their goal is to
organize as a formal political party in the 11 states of the old
Confederacy along with Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Oklahoma and
West Virginia. As they build political power, they plan to run
candidates for office and eventually push for secession.
</P>
<P>
   This action comes even though most of the top GOP leadership
posts on Capitol Hill are occupied by Southern lawmakers. The
president is also a son of the South as are the two leading
contenders to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Southern Party officers contend that political leaders sell
out their home state and regional interests to appease a national
audience in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The GOP loves Southern votes but hates to promote the social,
economic and cultural issues that matter to Southerners,'' said
George Kalas, chairman of the Southern National Committee. He
compared the South to Canada's Quebec, where many in the
French-speaking province believe their culture is threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the party's organizers are former Republicans who have
grown disgusted with what they see as the GOP's waffling on issues,
whether it's fighting gun control, promoting school prayer or
restricting immigration. The group will formally launch the party
with a North Carolina rally in August.
</P>
<P>
   Earle Black, an expert on Southern politics at Rice University
in Texas, said it's difficult for any third party to get off the
ground, and he questioned whether there is much support for a
conservative, regional party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't see any future for this particular
enterprise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cultivating Support
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to cut costs for Southern farmers, several lawmakers have
banded together to reform the federal crop insurance program.
</P>
<P>
   The Crop Insurance Equalization Act would establish discount
premiums for some farmers, increase coverage for fruits and
vegetables, allow cooperatives to sell crop insurance, limit
profits for insurance companies, stiffen penalties for fraudulent
claims and enact other changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers need a forward-looking, more permanent solution to the
weather and pricing crises they can't control,'' said Rep. Saxby
Chambliss, R-Ga., a member of the House Agriculture Committee.
``This bipartisan bill moves us one step closer to providing a
workable risk management system.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marion Berry, D-Ark., said many farmers feel the system
today is inefficient. ``Crop insurance isn't the answer to our
agriculture crisis, but it must be fair to Southern farmers,''
Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   Hot Seats?
</P>
<P>
   Watch for elections for state attorneys general to become key
battlegrounds between Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans in Congress trying to shift more power to the
states and curb the size and scope of the federal government, party
analysts realize that state offices may hold even greater power in
the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Republican attorneys general have formed
their own political group, the Republican Attorneys General
Association, to raise money and promote candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think competition serves the public well,'' said Alabama
Attorney General Bill Pryor, who serves as treasurer of the new
group. The chairman of the new group is Charlie Condon, attorney
general in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Pryor dismissed the notion that this new partisan effort would
somehow cheapen the office of attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of us are elected to public office and
therefore we go through a process that is the essence of
politics,'' Pryor said.
</P>
<P>
   Reef Madness
</P>
<P>
   Coral reefs struggling to survive off the Florida Keys and the
maritime border of Texas and Louisiana would get some relief from a
proposal advancing in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The new measure would authorize up to $100 million in reef
conservation programs over the next five years to halt the
degradation of the fragile resources. ``Environmental studies
indicate our nation's reefs continue to be threatened by pollution,
overfishing and severe climate changes,'' said Sen. John Breaux,
D-La., a backer of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   There's a bonus in the bill for Breaux and other reef
protectors: The measure allocates up to $15 million for research
grants. In Louisiana, the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium
is engaged in the type of reef research the bill would promote.

 &HT;    Within a stone's throw of centuries-old St. Peter's Square, four
seminarians from Atlanta prepare hearts and minds for the modern
priesthood
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ They are men in black lined up row by row, table by
table, in the refectory of the Pontifical North American College,
the Vatican's school for American priests. Overhead, a design in
muddy colors on the ceiling draws sarcastic comparisons to the
Sistine Chapel across St. Peter's Square.
</P>
<P>
   This is Sunday lunch, both the fanciest and the most relaxed
meal of the week. More than 40 priests are here on sabbatical for
continued studies, joining the 170 seminarians _ including four
from the Archdiocese of Atlanta _ who are candidates for the
priesthood. Some are entertaining guests from their parishes and
dioceses back in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After a multicourse meal in the Italian tradition, they will
visit with their guests and friends, study, watch videos, or play
basketball in the courtyard of their 1950s-vintage tan brick
building. It is a welcome respite from long weekdays of study and
worship.
</P>
<P>
   They will spend up to five years here. And, at the end of their
studies, those among the seminarians who have stayed the course
will leave this place, officially set apart by God and the Catholic
Church for a life of devotion and celibacy.
</P>
<P>
   The seminary was begun in 1859 when the Americans, upstarts in
terms of world history, requested their own institution at the
Vatican. It came to be called the North American College, instead
of the College of the United States, because the Civil War was on
the horizon and Catholics were not sure which side would win. A
young man named William Poole from the Diocese of Savannah was in
its first class.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of other seminaries serve students back in the States.
This one is special because of its proximity to the seat of the
Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 book called ``The New Men,'' journalist Brian Murphy
traced a group of students through their first year at what he
calls the ``elite'' college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using the past as a guide, the voices coming out of the North
American College will be heard as a force far stronger than their
numbers,'' he predicts. ``Some will rise _ perhaps reluctantly _ to
be bishops, archbishops and possibly even a cardinal,'' he adds.
``Others will be called to work on Vatican commissions, its
diplomatic corps, or study to become canon law experts. And even a
once-inconceivable scenario _ the election of an American pope by
the College of Cardinals _ could grow ever more plausible in their
lifetimes, considering the ever-expanding size and strength of the
Catholic Church in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an exceptional opportunity for young men to be exposed to
the universal church and the experiences of Rome,'' says the Rev.
David Talley, vocations director for the Archdiocese of Atlanta,
``and it's good for some of our men to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one men are preparing for the priesthood in the
Archdiocese of Atlanta. Each has been carefully screened and
counseled to determine where he should study.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four Atlanta seminarians at the North American College,
Talley says, ``They're wonderful and they're very different and
they're very committed, all four of them. They will be, God
willing, wonderful priests for the church of Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Name: Theodore ``Tad'' Book
</P>
<P>
   Age: 22
</P>
<P>
   Placement: First year
</P>
<P>
   The youngest and tallest _ at 6-foot-7 _ of Atlanta's
seminarians at the North American College, Tad Book says he felt a
call to the priesthood when he was walking home from a Boy Scout
meeting during his senior year at DeKalb County's Druid Hills High
School.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very sudden,'' he says. ``It was clear to me that this
was what I was called to do. I took a deep breath and swallowed the
lump in my throat. I thought, `If that's what God is calling me to
do, I have to do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The next day he went to talk to a local priest, who told him,
``Go to college, study, meet some women, and if you still want to
do it, go to seminary.'' Book followed the priest's advice and got
a degree in computer science from Georgia Tech before enrolling in
the North American College.
</P>
<P>
   Book admits that a degree from Georgia Tech seems to be strange
training for the priesthood. ``But,'' he said, ``I've certainly
ended up fixing a lot of guys' computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Book grew up in two churches. His mother is United Methodist.
His father is Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   He says he realized even as a teenager that ``religion has to be
an important quest. I couldn't go through life saying I believed in
something and not really living it. And I couldn't conceive of a
world without God. With that out of the way, I had to decide what
religion I belonged to. ... When it came down to choosing a
denomination, it seemed to me the Catholic Church was the only
church that could claim to go all the way back to Christ's
disciples.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he has come to terms with the commitment to celibacy.
``It seems to me very appropriate to the priesthood, a way you can
give yourself over totally to God. ... But it's certainly not
something everyone is called to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Book was born after the Second Vatican Council, which reshaped
the Catholic Church. He senses that the church has now settled in
to what, at the time, was radical change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good time for the church, a good time to be a
priest,'' he says. ``I think the next 40 years are going to be good
years.''
</P>
<P>
   As a first-year man, Book will stay in Rome this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Name: Dung Nguyen
</P>
<P>
   Age: 28
</P>
<P>
   Placement: Second year
</P>
<P>
   As a frightened little boy of 10 years of age, Dung Nguyen left
Vietnam in 1980 on a small boat with other refugees, including a
brother and a sister. Even then, he knew the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``My chance of surviving was 1 percent,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The boat sank, and the children were rescued by a merchant ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, I think a lot about it,'' says Nguyen. ``The
merciful, saving hand of God was instantly there.''
</P>
<P>
   He had a much older brother who had left Vietnam at the fall of
Saigon in 1975 and who was living in the United States as part of a
religious order. His brother left his religious order to take care
of his younger siblings. ``He was mom and dad,'' Nguyen says.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen's parents finally arrived in America in the early 1990s.
``Not seeing my parents for 13 or 14 years was very difficult,'' he
admits.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in a religious community while attending college in
Santa Fe, N.M., then spent some time with his parents in New
Orleans ``to rekindle family ties and understand family life more,
to decide whether religious life or family life was right for me.''
</P>
<P>
   After five years of family togetherness, he went to Rome last
year as a lay student at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas
Aquinas, commonly known as the Angelicum, ``to discern whether I
wanted this way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   He concluded that he does.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer he worked in Our Lady of Vietnam parish in
Riverdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what God has done for me, I want to respond with my
utmost, whole being,'' he says. ``That's serving the church and his
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen will be assigned to Sacred Heart parish in downtown
Atlanta for the summer break, beginning in July.
</P>
<P>
   Name: Luke Ballman
</P>
<P>
   Age: 33
</P>
<P>
   Placement: Third year
</P>
<P>
   Two decades passed between the time Luke Ballman first thought
of becoming a priest and the time he actually entered seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in a ``blue-collar Catholic family'' in Dayton, Ohio, he
attended parochial school. He remembers that a priest once came to
talk to the boys and girls about religious vocations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited about it,'' says Ballman. ``I went home, and my
parents didn't make a big deal. I forgot about it for 10 or 12
years.''
</P>
<P>
   In his early 20s, Ballman had completed the University of
Dayton, was living in Atlanta and working for Andersen Consulting,
an international management and technology consulting firm, when he
began attending Bible study with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``That experience deepened my relationship with Jesus Christ in
a way that was very personal,'' he says. ``I fell in love. That's
the only way to put it.''
</P>
<P>
   Again he thought of becoming a priest. Again he put the thought
away.
</P>
<P>
   At the consulting firm, Ballman was moving up the career ladder.
</P>
<P>
   At his parish, the Cathedral of Christ the King, he was also
growing more involved.
</P>
<P>
   At about age 27, he once again considered the priesthood. This
time, he consulted with the vocations director of the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would take it slow,'' he says, so he spent more
than a year contemplating his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Telling friends at the consulting firm that he would be
attending seminary offered a great opportunity for evangelism, he
says. ``Here I was, in a professional environment, discussing my
faith,'' he says. ``I couldn't help but talk about God.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballman attended seminary for a year at St. Vincent's in
Pennsylvania before beginning his work at the North American
College.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all as Christians called to follow Christ, yet I feel
called to live that out in a radical way,'' he says. ``I think many
people have lost meaning in life. I hope to allow God to give them
meaning through me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballman will spend the summer working in St. Pius X parish in
Conyers.
</P>
<P>
   Name: Charles Byrd
</P>
<P>
   Age: 35
</P>
<P>
   Placement: Third year
</P>
<P>
   As a small boy in the pews of Southern Baptist churches in
Columbus and Newnan, Charles Byrd got his earliest training in
Christianity. He had built a successful career in advertising when
his life began to move in a drastically different direction.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what drew him to Catholicism, Byrd ponders the
question, then says, ``The ultimate answer is God.''
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from the Portfolio Center, an Atlanta advertising
school, and landed a job with the largest advertising agency in
Louisville, Ky., handling accounts such as Kentucky Fried Chicken
and Humana hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisville, he began ``walking toward Catholicism,'' he says.
``I ended up dating Catholic girls and having Catholic friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Vernon Robertson, who had an inner city ministry with
Louisville's poor, gave him an impressive example of the Catholic
clergy. Robertson was a convert to Catholicism from the Episcopal
Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew to love this man and appreciate his faith,'' says Byrd.
``Ultimately, my being here is because of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd also looks to another example of the clergy, Jesus' New
Testament precursor, John the Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. John the Baptist says, `I must decrease so that he can
increase,''' Byrd says. ``I think that's the role of a priest, to
be a servant. If he has the grace and will to stay faithful to
that, wonderful things will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd says he considered returning to Louisville as a priest, but
decided to come home to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have a great respect for the Catholic Church in
Georgia,'' he says. ``Those people are my people, even though I
didn't grow up Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd has been assigned to St. Joseph's parish in Athens for the
summer, beginning in July.

 &HT;    Rock's revolving door brings blasts from past
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 27.
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cheer up, all you struggling former mega-stars _ all you fallen
gods of rock _ alone and forsaken since fame waltzed its fickle
waltz out of your life.
</P>
<P>
   Your fortunes may be about to change. While no one was looking,
it's become happening to be a has-been.
</P>
<P>
   Popular imagination thrives on rags-to-riches sagas, but what it
really loves are
rags-to-riches-to-rags-to-rehab-then-back-to-riches (or, at least,
a semblance of sanity) sagas. The phenomenal success of cable music
network VH1's ``Behind the Music'' program testifies to this. Since
the show debuted in 1997, water coolers throughout the nation have
been the site of passionate discussions of ... David Cassidy? Leif
Garrett? Tony Orlando?
</P>
<P>
   ``People are responding to these stories at a moment when there
aren't a lot of compelling new rock stars,'' says Alan Light,
executive editor of Spin magazine. Its latest cover features Axl
Rose of Guns N' Roses, who hasn't released a new album in seven
years. ``There's a hunger for larger-than-life survivors, or
victims, outsize personas in rock 'n' roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposing that ``What the World Needs Now Is Axl,'' Spin offers
an oral history on Rose. The archetypal bad-boy rocker of the late
'80s has become a recluse _ rock's answer to Howard Hughes or Garbo
_ since his band fell apart in the early '90s. But with a new
version of Guns N' Roses about to complete an album, there's
intense curiosity about Rose. And, as Light notes, the band's 1987
debut, ``Appetite for Destruction,'' still ``bangs out sales of
8,000 copies a week, and it can't all be 30-year-olds who are
buying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose will have lots of company. Tuesday, the original lineup of
the theatrical 1970s rock act Styx will release its first album of
all-new studio material in 16 years. ``Brave New World,'' on the
Raleigh label CMC, will likely get a boost from fan Adam Sandler's
new screen comedy, ``Big Daddy,'' which prominently features the
band's music. British rock act Def Leppard, its record sales
boosted by its own booze-sodden ``Behind the Music'' special, has
released ``Euphoria,'' its first album since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Summer's tour circuit is crowded with acts on the comeback
trail. Some are making a steep uphill trek, others cruising on a
surge in their fan base. Vanilla Ice, pop-metal acts Poison and
Great White (two of those so-called ``hair'' bands of the '80s),
hard-rock Dokken, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Journey and the Doobie Brothers
are all on the road.
</P>
<P>
   But the real sizzler is Cher, who performs Wednesday at Lakewood
Amphitheatre. The former TV star, who first enjoyed a singing
career in the 1960s alongside her former husband (and recently
deceased Republican congressman from California) Sonny Bono, is an
exemplary model of pop's Lazarus syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe'' (Warner Bros.), her double-platinum album and single
of the same name, has vaulted her into a steady spot in the Top 10
of Billboard's best-selling albums chart. It has given Cher her
highest profile since 1988, when she won an Oscar for
``Moonstruck.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, her career has wavered. She won more attention for
her rock star romances and tattooed buttocks, coped with a
debilitating bout of Epstein-Barr virus and came to terms with
daughter Chastity's coming-out as a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   It was time for a savvy makeover.
</P>
<P>
   The title song, which pumps along to the insistent, dance-happy
throb of house music, is a scorned lover's defiant kiss-off: ``But
after all is said and done/ You're gonna be the lonely one.''
Nothing new there. What's unusual is the way Cher's British
producers, Mark Taylor and Brian Rawling, have processed her vocals
on the tune's intro. Cher sounds chilly, computerized, not like
Cher at all. As the story plays out, the vocalist's gender remains
ambiguous. The song has registered strongly with gay audiences:
``If we didn't exist, Cher would have to invent us,'' writes
columnist Michael Alevar in Southern Voice, a weekly newspaper
devoted to Atlanta's gay community.
</P>
<P>
   Reviews of earlier shows on Cher's tour suggest that she hasn't
lost her flair for the theatrical. ``The appeal of the 52-year-old
diva has never been strictly about her voice,'' wrote Randy Cordova
in the Arizona Republic, covering the singer's first concert date
in Phoenix. The critic described ``a stage set that looked like a
medieval cave'' and Cher's ``flowing garb that made her look like a
sorceress from some 1960s King Arthur epic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe'' is a long way from the oldies Cher made famous on
TV, tunes like ``Half Breed,'' ``Bang Bang'' and ``I Got You,
Babe.'' But it's very similar to the way other artists of her
generation have reinvented themselves as strong, sexy survivors.
Tina Turner was rediscovered by the British dance act Heaven 17,
joining them in 1982 for a hit version of the Temptations' ``Ball
of Confusion.'' Tom Jones, surely a male diva if there ever was
one, lit a flame with the kids in 1988 when he cut a remake of
Prince's ``Kiss'' with British techno-popsters the Art of Noise.
That Cher, who has enjoyed her share of cosmetic surgery, seems
preternaturally ageless, also fits. We like our rebounding pop
stars to bust loose as if they've been hermetically sealed _ as
long as they don't forget their dirty laundry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just making it in the music business, by its very nature,
lends itself to sacrifice and personal drama,'' says George Moll,
VH1's vice president of productions, who oversees ``Behind the
Music.'' ``It's a natural. And especially with the older artists,
if you're hearing the music and understand where that music is
coming from, it puts you in a place that's very comfortable. Or it
reminds you of a comfortable time in your life, usually a time when
you had no responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   One man who deeply appreciates those insights is Tom Lipsky,
president and CEO of CMC International, a label affiliated with
industry major BMG that has built an empire on acts considered so
washed up no one else would sign them. ``There's perpetual value in
some of these artists,'' says Lipsky, whose roster includes Deep
Purple, Eddie Money, former Moody Blues singer Justin Hayward,
Lynyrd Skynyrd and Styx. ``And there's a new generation that's an
amazing group of rock historians. Go to a Lynyrd Skynyrd or a Styx
show, and you'll always see two generations of fans, sometimes
three generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipsky, who launched CMC in 1992 with ``Two dollars in my
wallet, a roll of duct tape and some Crazy Glue ,'' works within
certain parameters. He's not selling zillions of CDs, but his most
popular acts _ Styx and Skynyrd _ can sell 500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lipsky says he doesn't count on radio for support. Classic rock
stations focus on the old hits. So the bands tour constantly to
promote sales. By carefully working his niche, though, he's tapped
into a surprising cultural current.
</P>
<P>
   A few months after CMC released its first Skynyrd title in 1997,
``Behind the Music'' debuted its episode on the indefatigable
Southern rock act. And, boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never saw MTV kids at a Skynyrd show before,'' says Kevn
Kinney , the Athens rock vocalist whose band, Drivin N Cryin was
touring as opening act. ``People were saying, 'What are all these
kids doing here? It must be that VH1 thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Upcoming CMC projects include albums from Little Feat, Blue
Oyster Cult and .38 Special. ``It's not easy to compete with the
big pop machinery and the critics who say their time is past.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Lipsky accompanied his daughter to elementary
school for a show-and-tell session. ``It was `What My Daddy Does
Day,' and I was nervous,'' he says, prepared to be met with
indifference by a classroom of Backstreet Boys and N'Sync fans.
Lipsky's line of work turned out to be cooler than he could have
imagined. One little boy, whose parents had taken him to a concert
at the local amphitheater, piped up. ``He said, `Man, I saw the
Moody Blues. They really rocked!'''

 &HT;    New wave of music producers scoring success in city that
nurtured heavy-hitting careers of Dallas Austin and Jermaine Dupri
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 27.
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta is no one-hitmaker wonder. For about the past decade,
music producers Dallas Austin, Jermaine Dupri and Organized Noize
have made sure of that.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Austin. His work with pop trio TLC has helped make it
the best-selling female group in the country. Teen singer Monica,
whom he discovered, is so big she regularly makes magazine covers.
And the Grammy winner's audience is so wide she's doing both the
Nickelodeon kids' tour and the more mature Lilith Fair this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Dupri. On May 26, he received the American Society of
Composers, Authors &AMP; Publishers' (ASCAP) Rhythm and Soul Songwriter
of the Year award _ for the second time _ for work, including
Usher's ``You Make Me Wanna,'' Monica's ``The First Night'' and his
own rap single, ``Money Ain't a Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, consider Rico Wade, Pat ``Sleepy'' Brown and Ray Murray
of Organized Noize. They have taken Southern, Atlanta-specific rap
nationwide with the Grammy-nominated duo Outkast (``Rosa Parks''),
Goodie Mob (``Black Ice'') and Cool Breeze (``Creatine''), East
Point's unofficial booster.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, you couldn't come through this city trying to
do rap or R&AMP;B without running into Dallas, J.D. or Rico,'' says
Chris ``Tricky'' Stewart, owner of Atlanta's studio/label imprint
Red Zone Entertainment, and a new producer himself.
</P>
<P>
   But now there is a growing number of out-of-towners who have
taken the highway south and are heading up what seems like every
music chart but country.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some producers you should know:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tim &AMP; Bob:
</P>
<P>
   Radio is playing their tunes, but there's a good chance these
two don't hear them.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Kelley and Bob Robinson (from left), the creators of
Billboard magazine's No. 2 R&AMP;B single of 1998 (``They Don't Know''
by Jon B) and one of its Top 10 R&AMP;B producers of last year, say R&AMP;B
has become redundant and boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, the quality of the music these days is like, `Ugh!'''
says Kelley, 28. ``Everything sounds like the hit that was
happening last week. It's like, come on, be creative, do something
new. Please!''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Kelley and Robinson borrow stylistically from old
twosomes such as Gamble &AMP; Huff (who produced the O'Jays and Teddy
Pendergrass) and more recent urban music teams such as Jam &AMP; Lewis
(Janet Jackson, Jordan Knight) and Antonio ``L.A.'' Reid and
Kenneth ``Babyface'' Edmonds (Whitney Houston, Boyz II Men).
</P>
<P>
   ``They play the music on real instruments, write memorable
lyrics, arrange it beautifully _ Tim and Bob do it all,'' says
Austin. He hired the Peoria, Ill., natives at his Buckhead studio
six years ago, where they worked on million-selling projects for
Boyz II Men, Monica and Atlanta R&AMP;B quartet 112.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're using a studio in their sprawling Alpharetta home to
craft songs for Will Smith, Toni Braxton's sister Tamar and Kevon
Edmonds, Babyface's brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've broken in,'' says Robinson, 27, ``and now we're ready to
break R&AMP;B out of its slumber.''
</P>
<P>
   She'kspere:
</P>
<P>
   His name is familiar.
</P>
<P>
   It's just the spelling that throws people off.
</P>
<P>
   You've probably heard ``Bills, Bills, Bills'' by Destiny's Child
or the remix of Sam Salter's ``After 12, Before 6,'' songs for
which this 27-year-old California native (above) did the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``But his isn't the big `Puffy,' `R. Kelly' kind of name in the
industry,'' LaFace co-president Antonio ``L.A.'' Reid says.
``Yet!''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin ``She'kspere'' (pronounced Shakespeare) Briggs is slowly
and melodically establishing himself in the city he moved to only
18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since Briggs' first record, TLC's ``No Scrubs,'' hit No. 1 on
pop and R&AMP;B charts, ``people are calling for singles, not album
filler,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Among the artists with whom he's scheduled to work are pop
quintet 'N Sync, Grammy-winning vocalist Toni Braxton and Kandi
Burruss of Atlanta R&AMP;B quartet Xscape, his writing partner. She's
got a deal for a solo album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of She'kspere as one of the really big future
producers,'' Reid says. ``Because he understands the whole picture.
He understands the beat, the music. But there's also the importance
of melody and lyrical content ... and getting a good performance
out of an artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that is to say he is a well-studied producer, like guys
from the old days,'' Reid says. ``Not just a beatmaker.
She'kspere's a Renaissance man with a bright future.''
</P>
<P>
   Noontime:
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the name of the full-service record company for which
they work.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown Atlanta studio/
</P>
<P>
   label/management/publisher in which Teddy Bishop, Bryan Cox and
Jazze Pha (below, from left) record is a 24-hour operation.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, 28, checks in during the daylight hours, lights incense
and lays down the track that could possibly top his breakthrough
hit, Montell Jordan's ``Let's Ride.''
</P>
<P>
   On this particular afternoon, the former Detroit resident is
working with Toni Braxton. Teen R&AMP;B singer Aaliyah was here days
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   When evening comes, Pha (Phalon Alexander) arrives in his black
Range Rover. Pioneering rap artists such as Slick Rick or Too Short
ease in shortly after. Or it could be a night the 25-year-old from
Memphis works on his own project.
</P>
<P>
   Cox is doing double duty at Noontime's studio as well as
alongside Jermaine Dupri, with whom he's produced songs for local
R&AMP;B quartet Jagged Edge and remixed part-time Atlantan Elton John's
``The Muse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a regular one-stop hit factory,'' producer Sean
``Puffy'' Combs says of Noontime, headed by Ryan Glover, Henry J.
Lee II and Christopher Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the great thing,'' Bishop adds, ``is artists aren't coming
here to work with us to get an `Atlanta sound,' so to speak. They
just know there's people in Atlanta with songs that hit big across
the country.''

STEWART FEELS MORE AT HOME IN STOCK CARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LOWELL COHN   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. _ Tony Stewart was wearing a Home Depot
shirt. It was stylish as Home Depot shirts go. Tony Stewart is
clean-shaven and mild-mannered, and if you didn't know he's the
hottest rookie in Winston Cup you'd think he works at Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me, sonny. Which is the aisle for ceiling fans?''
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart doesn't work AT Home Depot. He's sponsored BY Home
Depot, in the Home Depot Pontiac Grand Prix, to be precise. Already
people are comparing him to Jeff Gordon _ in the sense that he's a
prodigy, in the sense that he knows instinctively what most drivers
never learn, and mostly in the sense that he's in sixth place in
the Winston Cup standings, two points behind Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's press luncheon for the Save Mart/Kragen 350,
someone asked Stewart if he sees himself as a rival to Gordon.
Stewart blinked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rival to me is a cold word,'' he said. ``There are more guys
to race other than Jeff Gordon every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Stewart had gotten through the obligatory politeness,
he had this to add. ``I think a lot of fans are looking for someone
new to come in and challenge Jeff. I can remember passing Jeff at
Darlington and I could see the crowd stand up and get excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Can we stop here a moment to examine that last statement?
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was driving something like 3 million mph. He'd just
passed Gordon. And he had enough poise to look away from the track,
which must have been unfolding as fast as one of those race-car
videogames. And then he was able to observe the crowd. And not only
that, he could gauge its excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if that's the case, then the mild-mannered Tony Stewart
must be Clark Kent to a Superman who exists only on race Sunday.
Someone in a position of authority should immediately investigate
this possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Stewart, 28, being a mere rookie is slightly
misleading in the first place. He started racing at age 5 when his
dad bought him what Stewart calls a yard cart. The tiny Stewart
immediately began tearing around the back yard of their Indiana
home. He also tore up the back yard.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually his dad got him a real go-cart, as much to save the
back yard as to please his son. And there was Stewart racing like a
madman _ make that a madkid _ at age 8. Stewart took to racing the
way other kids take to baseball or soccer. When he was in high
school he would sometimes call in sick on a Friday. Actually, he
would be in another state racing his go-cart. No big deal. His
teachers already knew the score. They'd even give him homework to
do on the road.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he was the Indy Racing League champion. He sat on the
pole at his first Indianapolis 500 and he's the only driver to win
three USAC major division championships in one year. Oh, by the
way, he drives for Joe Gibbs, who used to win Super Bowls with the
Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Not your garden-variety rookie.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the matter of what he did on May 30. He
competed in the Indianapolis 500, finishing ninth, then raced in
the Coca-Cola 600 in Charlotte, N.C., and finished fourth. But that
summary doesn't begin to describe Stewart's day, which was
something like dining at two all-you-can-eat restaurants in
succession without once getting sick to your stomach.
</P>
<P>
   When he was done with the 500 at about 2:30, he jumped into a
helicopter that flew him from the track to the airport. There he
boarded the Home Depot jet where he changed uniforms. He flew to
Charlotte and was whisked from the airport to the track in Rusty
Wallace's private helicopter. And, hey, doesn't everyone own a
private copter?
</P>
<P>
   He arrived at the track during driver introductions, 10 minutes
before the race. When the race started, he was struck forcibly in
the puss by the difference between an Indy car and a stock car.
``It was like going from a Porsche to a school bus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Stewart prefers school buses, although the Home
Depot Pontiac is orange instead of school-bus yellow. Why does he
like NASCAR more than Indy? For starters, Winston Cup has more
races than IRL. Also, in IRL he burned out a lot of engines and
that burned him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You crash more than burn engines in this series,'' he said by
way of praise for Winston Cup. ``Blowing engines is hard to
digest.''
</P>
<P>
   May we please stop once more to dissect Stewart's words? If we
understand him correctly, he's saying it's better to crash than to
bust an engine. Say what?
</P>
<P>
   ``And why are you racing NASCAR, dear?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing that can happen is you can crash. I find that
reassuring.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing Stewart likes about NASCAR is the car itself. Indy
cars are low to the ground and all that air rushes and hits his
head. In a stock car Stewart finds that his noodle's protected from
the breeze. Instead, he has an air conditioner which he often
adjusts by taking his hands off the steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Is this guy calm or what?
</P>
<P>
   He also can stretch in a stock car, but feels confined in an
Indy car. He didn't say whether he listens to the Rolling Stones on
the Home Depot Pontiac's radio. One assumes he does.
</P>
<P>
   Sears Point is the first road race of Stewart's Winston Cup
career, and to prepare for it he attended an intense one-day course
at Russell Racing School just before the California 500. He did
well except when he crashed the school's car into a fence and
busted a radiator and a few other things. None of that fazed him _
remember, this is the guy who likes crashing.
</P>
<P>
   The bill for damages came to a measly 800 bucks. He put the tab
on Gibbs' credit card and promptly forgot all about it, until Gibbs
called for an explanation. Stewart said he was more comfortable
with Gibbs paying instead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm far from being a millionaire,'' Stewart said Thursday.
``But I do want to achieve that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Me, too.

POLITICS LED TO MOB CRACKDOWN IN SMALL NEW YORK TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 27)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRED LeBRUN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ America in 1950 was blooming with optimism, full
of itself. We had just saved the world, survived the Great
Depression, and postwar opportunities seemed limitless.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities, to paraphrase the well-known Tammany Hall saying,
when seen are to be took. It was a maxim some had secretly followed
for years.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that a surprisingly innocent America was shocked to
discover that there was organized crime rampant in this country.
City after city was revealed to have entrenched gambling interests
linked to gangsters, aided and abetted by corrupt police and
compromised politicians. The vehicle for this revelation was the
Kefauver Crime Investigation Committee, a select group of U.S.
senators headed by Tennessee Democrat Estes Kefauver, who beginning
in 1950 called up 600 witnesses in 14 cities and blew the lid off
corruption in every one.
</P>
<P>
   Kefauver even managed to clean up cities where hearings were not
held _ including small ones, like the ``sin city,'' Saratoga
Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the hearings nor attendant television cameras ever made
it to the upstate New York community. Instead, witnesses were
called down to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Kefauver closed up shop after sensational testimony
in New York City in the middle of March 1951, he had managed to
deeply embarrass New York's Republican governor, and the
world-renowned casinos at Saratoga Lake that had waxed and waned
for more than a century soon would be closed, putting an end to
casino gambling in Saratoga Springs.
</P>
<P>
   The Kefauver hearings captivated the country. People took off
work to watch them on television. While these were the fifth Senate
hearings ever to be televised, they were the first to draw huge
numbers of viewers, an estimated 20 million to 30 million. The
impact was enormous.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing his trademark coonskin cap, Kefauver made a serious run
for the 1952 and 1956 presidential nominations largely based on the
celebrity garnered from these hearings. The hearings also gave many
Americans their first view of real, live gangsters in Frank
Costello and Joe Adonis, although in Costello's case, only his
hands were shown. It was a theatrical touch that made the No. 1
syndicate boss all the more compelling a TV character. As the
result of Kefauver's committee, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover sprang
out of deep denial that organized crime and racketeering existed,
which in turn radically changed law enforcement in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home and for better or worse, Kefauver's sincere
grandstanding _ followed by zealous New York Gov. Thomas E. Dewey's
attempts to outdo Kefauver _ utterly destroyed the gambling and
summer high-life culture that had abounded in Saratoga Springs and
along Saratoga Lake for a century. Dewey hastily assembled a state
crime commission two weeks after the Kefauver hearings closed to
``look into'' gambling in Saratoga. Then the governor impaneled a
special grand jury in Ballston Spa, whose rumblings lasted five
years and touched many lives.
</P>
<P>
   Dewey's investigation and grand jury came down on the Saratoga
gambling culture with a vengeance. Dewey had been stung by
Kefauver. The governor consequently vented his fury on both the
corrupt and the respectable citizenry who accepted gambling as the
status quo and accommodated it. When Dewey's grand jury was in full
swing, a bartender in Saratoga Springs moaned that his town was in
a sorry way. Everyone he knew had either been indicted or was under
subpoena to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Many to this day believe Saratoga Springs suffered the brunt of
Kefauver's inquiry because the senator from Tennessee needed to
solve a growing political problem.
</P>
<P>
   In city after city he showed pols on the take and cops turning a
blind eye while gambling interests thrived. Most of these cities,
however, tended to be Democratic bastions, and the corruption he
was exposing had intimate ties to his side of the aisle. He was
poking the stick in his own eye, which came back to cripple
Kefauver when the chips were down in the back rooms of the '52 and
'56 Democratic conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating this, Kefauver needed a good Republican city to
skewer, or at least one in a Republican state. New York was just
the ticket. Although Saratoga Springs was a bipartisan sin city,
there was no more prominent Republican in the country than Dewey.
The delicious irony was that Dewey lost the presidency in '48 by a
whisker, also trying to ride the crime-buster hobbyhorse into the
White House. But where Dewey had been a hard-nosed district
attorney seeking out corruption in New York City, as governor he
took more of a live-and-let-live approach to upstate gambling.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, Meyer Lansky, the brains of the Mob, went to jail in
Ballston Spa for three months after being indicted by the Dewey
grand jury. It was the first time Lansky was ever imprisoned. He
had this to say about it all later:
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew there was gambling up there. The place was full
of casinos. I had investments in the Arrowhead Inn and in the
Piping Rock, too. I'm sure the reason why the cops in Saratoga
suddenly took action was that Governor Dewey ordered an
investigation because of the Kefauver Report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just bad timing.''

AFTER RECORD-BREAKING NIGHT, U.S. SETS SIGHTS ON NORTH KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Americans had been warned about the voracious
Nigerian attack. Possess the ball, Coach Tony DiCicco had
instructed his players. Keep the defense intact. Don't let a track
meet break out in the middle of a soccer match.
</P>
<P>
   Within 62 seconds, Nigeria drew ahead 1-0 Thursday night. The
65,080 red-white-and-blue faces in the stands at Soldier Field were
stunned. The red faces among the American players told of anger and
nausea.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get mad and you get a little sick feeling in your
stomach,'' said forward Tiffeny Milbrett.
</P>
<P>
   Given that there were 88 minutes still to play, the Americans
did not have to break out the two-minute offense. Relentlessly,
they pressed forward through a Nigerian defense that was more a
sieve than a wall, scoring three goals in four minutes. By
halftime, the United States had pulled ahead 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Milbrett blasted a rebound shot through the right hand of
Nigerian goalkeeper Anne Chiejene in the first half and slid into a
splendid pass from Cindy Parlow in the 83d minute, poking the shot
into the net, pulling the Americans ahead 7-1 and putting an
exclamation point on what she would call ``the most exciting game
we've ever played.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven goals equaled the most the United States has scored in a
Women's World Cup match.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never prepare for a team coming out and scoring in the
first two minutes,'' Milbrett said. ``We got angry and alert and we
started playing our game. We had a lot of good chances and we put
them away.''
</P>
<P>
   With two victories in group play, the Americans still have not
officially claimed a spot in the quarterfinals next Thursday at
Jack Kent Cooke Stadium outside of Washington, but that should be a
mere formality.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-team field is divided into four groups. The top two teams
from each group advance after round-robin play. If the United
States, Nigeria and North Korea end up tied after Sunday's final
group matches, the first tiebreaker would be goal differential. The
Americans have scored 10 goals and surrendered only one. If they
can avoid being humiliated by North Korea on Sunday in Foxboro,
Mass., they will book a quarterfinal match against either Germany
or Brazil. This is such a certainty that DiCicco may rest some of
his starters on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   While Mia Hamm controlled much of Thursday's match with a goal
and brilliant passes on corner kicks and free kicks, five American
players scored against Nigeria. None was more relieved than
Milbrett, who had been the team's most reliable scorer this year,
but who had suffered hits to her shoulder and her composure in the
opener last Saturday against Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Playing before 78,972 fans at Giants Stadium - the largest crowd
ever to watch a women's sporting event in this country - Milbrett
admitted being nervous and rattled. Two pummeling hits further took
her out of her game, which consists of quick, slashing charges
toward the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't feel like myself,'' Milbrett said. ``I was mad
about that. We had never played in a tournament like this before.
It was warranted to have some nerves.''
</P>
<P>
   Before each match, DiCicco meets individually with each of his
players. Thursday, he said he could sense that Milbrett was calm
and determined. She opened with an aggressive tackle, drove a shot
wide across the goal mouth, then began finding the target as the
American attack poured through an overwhelmed Nigerian defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talked to Tiffeny, I could tell she was excited to
play,'' DiCicco said. ``She wasn't satisfied with the game on
Saturday. I knew she'd come out and be all over the field.'' &QL;

   &UR; Queen Elizabeth &LR;  dined in a public restaurant last week, the
first such meal in her reign of almost 50 years. The Queen,
 &UR; Prince Philip  &LR; and  &UR; Prince Charles  &LR; ate at the Compleat Angler in
Marlow, as guests of Hungarian President  &UR; Arpad Goncz &LR;  and his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   The Mirror of London reported that no other guests were allowed
in the restaurant, and security personnel dived into the lake at
the end of the restaurant's garden to make sure no monster was
lurking. Restaurant staff were subject to security checks, and dogs
were employed to check out a church across the road. The meal
proceeded without incident.

   In Los Angeles, administrators of the Skirball Cultural Center
Museum, which focuses on Judaic artifacts from all over the worlds,
announce  &LR; Monday  &LR; that they plan to create a permanent exhibit for
an original copy of the Nuremberg Laws and a ``Mein Kampf''
presented at the end of the war to General
 &UR; George Patton &LR; , who donated the material to the Huntington Library.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the documents, which bear wax seals of the Third
Reich, is a June 1945 letter from Patton explaining that the
documents had been discovered in a vault by the Third Army, when
they entered the city of Nuremberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``These soldiers of the 90th Division were very fond of me, and
I was very fond of them. They thought they would like to do
something for me, so they sent for me, and we had a great public
presentation. ... So it is my property.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the copy of ``Mein Kampf,'' Patton said it was alleged to
have been one of 100 copies of the unexpurgated text. ``It was
published by a man named  &UR; Emman &LR; . He is the No. 3 bad man in
Germany. I have him in jail now. We'll stretch him pretty quick!''

QUESTIONS LINGER IN WAKE OF EMPLOYEE CHANGES AT FORT WORTH ZOO
</HEADLINE>
 (Resending to fix typo) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Without question, the Fort Worth Zoo is one of North Texas'
premier community assets. A combination education and entertainment
mecca, the zoo has been successful at attracting millions of
visitors each year to help enhance Fort Worth's reputation as a
cultural center in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As a public asset, it naturally draws scrutiny if something
changes at the park, and that includes personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth Zoo is instituting what officials described as
sweeping changes in its education program, in part to act as a
better resource for the public schools and to attract federal grant
and foundation money that is available for conservation and
education efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of achieving those goals, officials swept out
some of the men and women who helped cement the zoo's distinction
as one of the top five zoological parks in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo Director Gregg Hudson said that in an effort to be more
competitive with the other informal education programs from which
parents can choose to send their little ones, the zoo is requiring
that all paid teachers hold state teaching certificates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents want certified teachers,'' Hudson said. ``They expect
certified teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Ken Seleske was laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Seleske, who holds a bachelor's degree in psychology and a
master's in zoology, has forgotten more about animals than most
people could ever absorb in a lifetime. An animal expert with 23
years' experience at the zoo, Seleske has been responsible for
expanding the knowledge of countless people _ young and old, at the
zoo and throughout Tarrant County classrooms _ about the wonders of
God's various creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Barbara Opdenhoff, whose position was eliminated
through department restructuring, Seleske had daily contact with
the zoo's cadre of docents whose thousands of volunteer hours since
1972, valued at $1.5 million, are vital to the nonprofit zoo's
operations. Ken and Barbara O., as Opdenhoff is called, helped
train the docents in everything from conservation and general
taxonomy of animal species to the specific characteristics of each
animal found at the zoo. In turn, the docents helped teach the more
than 120,000 youngsters who came to the zoo during the 1998-99
school year for everything from one-hour sessions to full-day
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the docents were devastated at the news of the
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Full disclosure: I have firsthand knowledge of just how upset
the docents are because my sainted mother is one of them. She
received the zoo's Volunteer of the Year award last year and
considers Ken and Barbara O. part of her extended family. In our
family, if Mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the parents of the more than 1,500 children who signed
up for zoo school this summer may have indeed asked about teacher
qualifications before registering their children. It's more likely
that there was an assumption on their part that the zoo wouldn't
have folks in the classrooms who didn't know their bisons from
their water buffaloes. The more intellectually honest explanation
is that the zoo hopes certified teachers will impress grant review
committees that have millions of collective dollars to dole out.
</P>
<P>
   Grant review applications are funny beasts _ credentials,
certifications, the amount of alphabet soup behind someone's name
carry a lot of weight. Just ask any college professor who's ever
applied for foundation money. The time they spend in a classroom
isn't worth a dime; it's how many advanced degrees they have, and
how much they've been published.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything wrong with the zoo going after private and
public grant dollars? Absolutely not. As a nonprofit organization
that sweats out each year's budget allocations, it's a smart
business decision to look for any and all revenue streams.
</P>
<P>
   When the docents put aside their personal feelings about Ken and
Barbara, they can see the big picture of how the zoo must compete
in a world of increasing choices for people's discretionary
dollars. They don't have a problem with changing the curriculum so
that it complements the scientific principles that students are
expected to learn in each grade level under the Texas Essential
Knowledge and Skills established by the Texas Education Agency.
They don't have a problem with upgrading the classrooms to include
computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   They just don't understand why two people who possess incredible
knowledge of and love for animals weren't retained to help make the
changes, instead of being sacrificed to them.

GERMAN PARLIAMENT APPROVES PLAN FOR MEMORIAL TO JEWS KILLED IN THE
HOLOCAUST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ After a decade of increasingly fraught debate over the
place of memory in a society now two generations removed from the
Nazi era, the German Parliament approved a plan Friday for the
building of a vast memorial in the heart of this city to the six
million Jewish victims of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The vote opened the way for the construction near the
Brandenburg Gate of a project designed by the New York architect
Peter Eisenman. It will combine a field of more than 2,000 stone
pillars with a building that is officially being called a
``documentation center'' but will have many of the attributes of a
Holocaust museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not building this monument solely for the Jews,'' said
Wolfgang Thierse, the speaker of Parliament. ``We are building it
for ourselves. It will help us confront a chapter of our history.''
</P>
<P>
   That confrontation has been going on for many years, often with
a wrenching honesty. So insistent has reflection on Hitler been
that many Germans have become impatient with it.
</P>
<P>
   The country's protracted difficulty in reaching agreement on
what sort of memorial, if any, to build in the Berlin now being
reborn as the capital of a united Germany clearly reflected a
tension between remembrance and a growing desire among young
Germans to emerge from history's long shadow.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate on those issues had become increasingly
circuitous and the vast site reserved for the memorial between the
glistening, newly built Potsdamer Platz and the reopened Reichstag
had become a growing embarrassment. As other empty stretches of
land were filled with new buildings, the 4.9-acre vacant lot began
to resemble a hole in the city's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office eight months ago, the center-left Government
of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has pushed for a decision, and its
top cultural official, Michael Naumann, has led the quest for a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts evidently paid off Friday as Parliament voted by 314
to 209, with 14 abstentions, to approve Eisenman's ambitious
project. In many ways, the memorial's size and position insure that
it will be a central element in the emergent city of refurbished or
newly built ministries and embassies mushrooming where the Berlin
wall once stood and where Hitler once presided.
</P>
<P>
   The vote backed a compromise reached between Eisenman and
Naumann last January. The agreement involved reducing the number of
stone pillars to about 2,000 from close to 3,000 and adding a
building that will house an extensive archive, an information
center and an exhibition space.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the compromise reflected a desire to combine the
purely artistic expression of remembrance and remorse with a center
that would be accessible and useful. Naumann called the idea a
``superb synthesis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The 10-year discussion has at last reached a successful
conclusion,'' said Andreas Nachama, the head of the Berlin Jewish
community. ``Now the plans can finally be implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was evident in Parliament Friday that strong reservations
persist, particularly in Berlin itself. Mayor Eberhard Diepgen, a
Christian Democrat, denounced Eisenman's project for its
``monumentality'' and said it would have no resonance for future
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Diepgen is known for his intimate sense of this city's mood, and
with elections later this year, he clearly took a position that he
believes will be well received locally.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, city authorities could still stall the construction,
now set to begin next year, but that seems unlikely given
Parliament's clear message Friday that the time has come to get on
with it.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor had backed a plan for a far smaller stone memorial
inscribed simply with the words ``Thou Shalt not Kill'' proposed
earlier this year by a Berlin theologian, Richard Schroeder, saying
that its ``precision, dignity and modesty'' gave it more power than
Eisenman's project. But the Parliament voted today to reject that
idea.
</P>
<P>
   One evident problem with the inscription ``Thou Shalt not Kill''
is that it appeared to reflect the mood of the Germany of the
post-war years with its insistence that ``only peace'' would go out
from German soil, rather than the Germany that has recently been at
war in the Balkans and has now sent thousands of peacekeeping
troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted by the conflict of two basic principles of the
post-war German state _ ``No more war'' and ``No more Auschwitz'' _
Chancellor Schroeder's government has sided with the latter,
explaining its decision to join the NATO bombardment of Kosovo in
terms of the need to stop ethnic persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Before approving Eisenman's plan, the Parliament voted by 325 to
218, with 8 abstentions, to support the building of a memorial
specifically dedicated to the Jews, rather than one to all victims
of the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   One German Jewish leader, Solomon Korn, expressed regret over
the decision. ``The Bundestag made a mistake by voting for a
memorial that commemorates only the Jewish victims of the
Holocaust,'' he said. ``By doing so, it creates the impression that
there is a hierarchy among the victims.''
</P>
<P>
   But in general Germany's small but growing Jewish community _
swelled recently by the arrival of thousands of Jews from Russia _
expressed satisfaction at the outcome.

NISSAN SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING TAKES ON SOME WESTERN TRAPPINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Nissan Motor Co. permitted outside news coverage of its
annual shareholder meeting Friday for the first time, a sign that
even the most traditional Japanese businesses are moving toward the
greater disclosure and openness expected by foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the brief choreographed agendas that have been
customary at Japanese companies' annual meetings, the Nissan event
ran 2 hours and 25 minutes. It also featured some other
characteristics of Western annual meetings _ a slick video
presentation and an outraged shareholder, who in this case demanded
the resignation of the troubled company's president, Yoshikazu
Hanawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've made mistake after mistake in your management
decisions,'' scolded the shareholder, who identified himself only
as Mr. Tamura but could easily have been mistaken for the Japanese
version of an American shareholder gadfly like Evelyn Y. Davis or
John Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   Hanawa is not the only Japanese executive now facing this kind
of scrutiny. Other Japanese companies are beginning to conduct
annual shareholder meetings of the kind held in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know the investor base is shifting for them from the more
comfortable relationships they've had with banks and affiliates
that have traditionally been their shareholders to more active
types of investors like foreigners,'' said Craig Chudler, a
strategist at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming practice for most companies is still to hold
their annual shareholders' meetings on the same day of the year,
forcing an investor who holds stock in two or more of them to pick
one, and to bar the press from attending.
</P>
<P>
   The Nikkei Shimbun, Japan's version of The Wall Street Journal,
puts the number of listed companies holding their shareholders'
meetings next Tuesday at 1,374, or 88 percent of the total. Nissan
was one of 109 listed companies that held their meetings Friday,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nissan meeting was its first since the company signed a deal
with France's Renault SA in March that will combine some operations
of the two automakers and strengthen Nissan's debt-heavy balance
sheet.
</P>
<P>
   The executive that Nissan's shareholders had really wanted to
see Friday was Carlos Ghosn, the former Renault executive who
Friday became Nissan's first ever chief operating officer,
effectively putting him in charge of day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   Two shareholders who spoke Friday expressed a vague concern that
Renault's purchase of a 36.8 percent stake in Nissan was the first
step toward a takeover, and Tamura, the outraged shareholder, noted
a recent interview in which Takashi Ishihara, a former chairman of
Nissan, described Renault as a second-rate car company. ``Don't you
feel sorry for Ghosn when people are saying such things?'' he asked
Hanawa, pressing the president to explain why a potential deal with
DaimlerChrysler AG had fallen apart.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn, who was appointed to his new position during a board
meeting Friday, gave a brief speech in Japanese that was an effort
to assuage some fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to emphasize to you that I have come to Japan not
for the good of Renault but for the good of Nissan,'' he told
shareholders.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27)  
 (af)  
 By JAMES G. COBB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Huge, heavy and haughty, bristling with technology under its
slab-sided styling, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class has been a global
symbol of power and success for princes and prime ministers,
generals and godfathers, capitalists who have conquered markets and
revolutionaries who have come to power.
</P>
<P>
   Reinventing such a car wouldn't be easy even without the
pressures on the product planners at Mercedes-Benz. They had to
lighten up one of the most overengineered, overbuilt vehicles on
the planet.
</P>
<P>
   They had to make it sleeker and more contemporary, yet retain
the family look and timeless quality of a big Mercedes. They needed
to showcase Mercedes' engineering prowess, but in a car that would
be less expensive and more competitive _ the keys to the company's
resurgence the last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a car that is shorter, lower and narrower, yet
more spacious in the dimensions that count. Though 500 pounds
lighter, it rides as smoothly as any car on the market and promises
unparalleled crash protection. To the driver it is creamy, seamless
and capable of feats one would hardly expect of a 4,000-pound
luxury car.
</P>
<P>
   It also has the latest electronic gadgets. There is an optional
voice-activated phone and a Teleaid connection that calls up
technical or emergency aid from a live person, in the vein of
General Motors' Onstar.
</P>
<P>
   So the car talks to you and you can talk to it. It knows where
you are and how to get home. It cools or heats your backside, with
or without a massage. It compensates for dumkopf drivers by taking
over the braking in an emergency or halting a skid in midstream. It
won't cook your breakfast, but it can find a pancake house.
</P>
<P>
   If it knows your height it will adjust the surroundings to fit
you. There is memory for an array of preferences, including all
three mirrors. Next year, with the arrival of a smart cruise
control, the car will maintain a preset distance behind another
vehicle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The S-Class is now slightly wedge-shaped, lower and sleeker than
before. Up front, the classic grille sweeps back, framed by
stylized headlamps that are not quite oval, not quite triangular,
not quite rectanglar.
</P>
<P>
   The rear is jaunty and purposeful with wraparound taillamps in
the style of the SLK roadster's. The brake lights consist of
light-emitting diodes instead of bulbs; they illuminate 15
milliseconds faster, giving tailgaters 16 extra feet of warning at
62 mph.
</P>
<P>
   More LEDs show up in side marker lights on the outside mirrors,
which display the turn signals to cyclists and pedestrians
alongside the car. Xenon gas headlamps are standard on the S500,
optional on the less expensive S430, and they provide marvelous
illumination _ though some oncoming drivers clearly find them
irritating.
</P>
<P>
   The six-cylinder S-Class is gone from America, but there are two
V8s: the S430 has a 275-horsepower, 4.3-liter power plant and the
S500 has a 5-liter, 302-horsepower unit. A V12-powered S600 will
arrive as a 2001 model, but the 5-liter is so smooth, so exuberant,
so overqualified for any North American road that a bigger engine
can only be an extravagance.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed automatic has summer and winter modes and a
Sportshift control with just one forward position. When the shift
lever is in ``D,'' the driver taps the lever left or right for
gears 1 through 4.
</P>
<P>
   On two test cars, this shifter added a measure of control on
several jaunts through New York's mountains. Along with an adaptive
damping control that really works _ its firm or soft settings
emphasize either crisp handling or a soft ride _ an air-spring
suspension lets you raise or lower the car by about an inch, handy
for navigating bad roads. The ride height automatically drops by a
half-inch at speeds over 85.
</P>
<P>
   The car is capable of brilliant handling, and like the BMW
7-Series it feels considerably smaller than it is. The steering has
just the right weight, the correct amount of power assist, to
inspire confidence in high-speed turns or low-speed parking.
</P>
<P>
   The brakes are computerized for your protection: In addition to
an anti-lock function they are programmed to recognize panic stops
and respond with full braking force. And they modulate the force
among the wheels to prevent lockup.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the S-Class has Mercedes' Electronic Stability
Program, which made its debut on the S-Class in 1996. The system
continuously calculates whether the S-Class is going where the
driver is steering it; if it senses a skid, it selectively applies
the brakes to keep the car on track.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go for a ride. Since it's a hot day, aim the key at one of
the front door handles and hold down the unlock button. The doors
unlock, the windows roll down and the sunroof retracts. Don't slam
the doors or the trunk; they finish closing automatically. As you
start the engine, the ventilated seats are already working, their
10 electric fans blowing air through the cushion and backrest.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Adjust the seat to get the proper leg room. If you push the
button marked ``E'' (for ergonomic) among the memory controls on
the door, various of the seat's 14 adjustments will automatically
move to accommodate your height. Or you can use the seat controls
to adjust the depth of the bottom cushion or the height of the
headrests, which also expand out to form a pillow.
</P>
<P>
   An option is an active lumbar feature; seven air chambers in the
seat slowly expand and deflate to stimulate the spine. Given that
this takes place within ultrasoft perforated leather, one has the
sensation of lounging against a very plush sleeping cow.
</P>
<P>
   The spacious back seat can be had with adjustable outer
seatbacks. Or if you're a master of the universe who leaves the
driving to others, order the ``two seat'' rear package. There is a
center console and seats with all the adjustments available up
front. Control freaks can manipulate the front passenger seat from
the rear.
</P>
<P>
   The dashboard is a flowing ``wave'' design with burl walnut trim
(calyptus in the S430; chestnut is optional). The gauges are clear,
simple and bright, but the speedometer tempts you to play Autobahn
racer with ``80'' at the top of the dial.
</P>
<P>
   The steering wheel also controls a multifunction display amid
the gauges, which provides readouts of all sorts of information,
from trip computer to navigation, audio and telephone functions.
</P>
<P>
   The showcase of the car's electronic wizardry is the COMAND
screen in the dash. This unit _ officially called the Cockpit
Management and Data System _ controls the standard navigation
system and Bose stereo and the optional telephone and CD changer.
It is a lot to ask of a handful of buttons and toggles, and few are
likely to master the system quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The navigation system showed the usual benefits and deficiencies
of its breed _ occasionally odd directions, out-of-date restaurant
listings, controls that can be distracting while driving. But the
voice-activated cell phone was a nice touch. Using controls on the
steering wheel (the first from Mercedes) you can tell the car's
automated operator _ I called her Ernestine, for the Lily Tomlin
character _ to dial a number or create listings in an audible phone
book.
</P>
<P>
   Ernestine's digital voice was pleasant even when apologizing for
not recognizing a command (``Sorry,'' she would say. ``Cancel,
cancel.'') But after being told several times that ``that function
is not possible,'' I found I was raising my voice with her.
</P>
<P>
   At least she allows a driver to focus on the road. Not so the
audio controls. Instead of logical buttons and knobs, Mercedes has
come up with page upon page of on-screen menus. Simple tasks like
lowering the bass or rewinding a tape are maddening.
</P>
<P>
   And the selections are not instantly obvious: Quick, at 70 mph,
what is the difference between ``FM presets'' and ``Auto presets''?
</P>
<P>
   The S-Class also shows a few signs of cost-cutting _ this in
cars that start around $70,000 for the S430 and $80,000 for the
S500. Some plastic pieces _ the mirror housing, the storage
compartments under the front seats _ feel cheap. The cup holders in
front are small and inconvenient, and those in the rear would be
objectionable in a Hyundai.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, driving the S500 is a little like piloting
your computer. If your VCR still flashes ``12:00,'' this may not be
a car for you. Or it might be _ nothing prevents you from turning
off the electronic noise and reveling in the hush of the cabin,
concentrating on the road. The S500 performs so flawlessly that it
rises above any gimmicks that fall short of perfection. &QL;

 By ALEX WITCHEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cooking with cleavage is not an everyday occurrence
in my kitchen. Neither is cooking in heels. But when a model is
involved, it seems, anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Padma Lakshmi has walked the runway for Giorgio Armani, Gianni
Versace and Ralph Lauren, and has appeared in Vogue, Elle,
Mirabella and Glamour. She has also just published a cookbook,
``Easy Exotic: A Model's Low-Fat Recipes From Around the World''
(Miramax, $25.95).
</P>
<P>
   When I first heard about the book, I laughed. A model who cooks
what? Ice soup? Preposterous. Forget all this blather about a
backlash to Kate Moss, and Calvin Klein shunning supermodels to
photograph real people. I read magazines like everyone else, and no
one in sight has a thigh like mine. But Ms. Lakshmi's book signals
a potential revolution: models not only as real people, but also as
Mama. No more skeletal adolescents fueled by Champagne bubbles, but
robust beauties who shop and cook _ albeit braless, in a tank top,
like Ms. Lakshmi, sporting three miles of leg.
</P>
<P>
   Though she grew up cooking with her grandmother in Madras,
India, Ms. Lakshmi became head chef in charge of homesickness for
her glamorous pals languishing on exotic locations. She cooked them
hearty pots of food, minus any ingredients that could compromise
their employment. She admits to having no formal training, but I
wanted to see how she did it, anyway. I was hoping some magic might
rub off. Eat a model's meal, lose 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   As we set out to shop and cook, I felt the tiniest bit smug.
Someone who looks like Ms. Lakshmi _ 5 foot 9, with a 24-inch
waist, no hips and 34C chest (on the days she does wear a bra) _
probably seems like a culinary genius to other models. But the
relaxed-fit crowd would see right through her.
</P>
<P>
   They certainly saw something. At my corner market, the
stockboys, the manager and the men who passed her on the street
gaped. While she was perfectly pleasant chatting with me, somehow,
when men appeared, she seemed to effervesce _ like an Alka-Seltzer
dropped into water. Which I could have used just watching it. All
rationalizations to the contrary, it was stunning to see such a raw
display of beauty as power, because that's what it was, pure and
simple. Well, not simple, certainly. And certainly not fair.
</P>
<P>
   So I did the most rotten thing I could think of to a model,
knowing she hadn't begun her career until after she graduated from
Clark University in Worcester, Mass., and that she had lived for
six years in Italy and also in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``How old are you?'' I asked. She crossed her arms and said
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to tell me, are you?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never,'' she answered, heading straight to the produce,
snapping off a sprig of cilantro and tasting it. She slipped it
into a bag and zoomed forward, sniffing and picking the way my
grandmother used to. At the register, she looked dismissively at
the head of garlic I had chosen, and replaced it with a container
of peeled cloves. ``So we don't have to smell of it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Out of nowhere, the manager appeared, nodding and smiling, and
credited the head of garlic. I must be in that store twice a week
and I've never seen him do anything but scowl.
</P>
<P>
   We walked back to my apartment, and Ms. Lakshmi talked about the
transition she is trying to make to an acting career. She recently
appeared in a television miniseries in Italy and shot a film that
will be released there in October. It helps that she speaks five
languages: Italian, Spanish, English, Hindi and Tamil, which she
says is spoken mainly by Sri Lankans.
</P>
<P>
   Back in my building, I thought the doorman would faint at the
sight of her. When I mentioned it, she just smiled. ``Would I have
it any other way?'' she asked. ``Come on. But it's up to me to keep
up my end of the bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be diet. Ms. Lakshmi said she never starves herself _
it makes her cranky _ but when it comes to overeating, she will
look at food and say, ``I'm worth too much to put this into my
stomach.'' I nodded, but she might as well have said that part in
Tamil.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, Ms. Lakshmi went straight to business, cutting
and chopping a minimal amount, because in this recipe, misleadingly
called coconut chicken (requiring one can of light coconut milk),
most ingredients for the sauce, including onion, garlic, ginger and
jalapeno, went into the blender.
</P>
<P>
   I offered her one of my aprons, which she tied around her waist
_ twice. Does she exercise every day? She shook her head and
chopped cilantro. ``No, I have a trainer, or I won't go to the gym
otherwise,'' she said. ``Cardio is the best thing for weight
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   She deserves credit for keeping a reasonably sane take on
herself in a business where eating disorders abound amid the
unforgiving scrutiny of something like a runway walk in a string
bikini. Ms. Lakshmi said she had recently broken her engagement to
an Italian man she called ``a food fascist,'' who would tell her
what to eat, how much and when. Since then she dated yet another
food fascist, she said, whose ``waist was smaller than mine.'' She
added: ``If you can't have fun with food, that's a symptom to a
bigger problem. It's one of nature's biggest pleasures, as basic as
breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't always been deprived, however. ``Because of what I
look like I've been wined and dined everywhere,'' she said easily.
``I've had my share of Eurotrash older guys and they've taken me to
wonderful restaurants. I could taste what was in the food, and I
stole the recipes.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen was starting to smell delicious. The way she came to
write ``Easy Exotic,'' which is separated into sections from
countries where she has lived and worked, including Spain, France,
Italy, India and Morocco, was by cooking for some actors in Los
Angeles, where she moved six months ago to pursue her film career.
They mentioned the meal to Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of
Miramax Films, whom she later met at a movie premiere. She told him
it was her dream to write a cookbook _ and voila. He sent her to
Miramax Books. ``This is honestly the food I make for myself and
for my friends,'' models and civilians, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The current craze for eliminating carbohydrates doesn't interest
Ms. Lakshmi, though she advises eating them during the day. ``If
you want rice you can have a tennis-ball-size portion,'' she said.
``But don't expect to lose weight eating a mountain of rice.'' I
felt myself blush. I guess I've been inspired more by footballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And at night,'' Ms. Lakshmi went on, ``you can have some fish
with steamed vegetables. That's fine.'' How did I know she was
going to say that? It's like hearing the same bedtime story with
the bad ending that never changes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the food in the pot, which according to the cookbook
has only 10 grams of fat a serving, was looking sensational. Ms.
Lakshmi basically followed the recipe, though she didn't measure
many ingredients, preferring, she said, to ``eyeball it.'' She
broke into a piece of steaming chicken breast with her bare fingers
and didn't flinch. ``Nice and tender,'' she said, leaving the pot
uncovered so the liquid would reduce.
</P>
<P>
   We sat at the dining room table, where I smoked and she drank
mineral water. She said that for all the talk about a model
backlash, she doesn't see one. ``I think it's the opposite,'' she
said. ``I was considered thin when I first started modeling, but
not anymore. These girls today start really young. They don't even
finish high school. Without an education, I may never have
appreciated the places I went to if I didn't understand where I was
going.''
</P>
<P>
   The chicken was done, and Ms. Lakshmi ate two servings, which
would equal one of mine. No rice.
</P>
<P>
   My husband appeared, bewitched by both the smells in the kitchen
and the woman in the low-cut dress who put them there. But alas, my
stepson arrived from his basketball game too late. Ms. Lakshmi had
gone. He held up the book with her picture on the cover. ``She was
here?'' he asked incredulously. His ardor only grew once he tasted
the food.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's who I'm going to marry,'' he declared, as his father
looked on approvingly. ``A hot girl who can cook Indian food.''
</P>
<P>
   I smiled weakly. Bring on the Alka-Seltzer.

LUXEMBOURG ENVOY HOLDS WELCOME DINNER FOR HORMEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Luxembourg's ambassador to the United States,
Arlette Conzemius, held an intimate, four-course dinner Thursday
night at her country's embassy here to welcome gay rights advocate
James C. Hormel to his new post as U.S. envoy to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 people attended the affair on Washington's Embassy Row,
including Hormel's longtime partner, Timothy Wu of San Francisco,
and Hormel's daughter, one of his five children, according to one
of the guests.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, 66, a San Francisco philanthropist and heir to a
meatpacking fortune, will be sworn in at a State Department
ceremony Tuesday and will become America's first openly gay
ambassador. He received a recess appointment from President Clinton
on June 4 after more than 18 months of Senate battles over his
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   California's Democratic senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara
Boxer, attended the send-off dinner. Feinstein, who has been a
friend of Hormel for 30 years, was accompanied by her husband,
Richard Blum, a San Francisco investment banker.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers at the dinner were Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,
and Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., a member of the Foreign Relations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had called for lifting the so-called ``holds'' put on
Hormel's nomination in the Senate by four conservatives who
objected to his gay-rights advocacy. Smith argued against his
fellow Republicans, saying Hormel should be judged on his
qualifications alone.
</P>
<P>
   The four senators said they feared he would pursue a gay agenda
in the Luxembourg post. Hormel said he would not do that. But
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott _ who has linked homosexuality to
alcoholism, sex addiction and kleptomania _ refused to lift the
holds. Hormel was said to have had the support of at least 60 of
the Senate's 100 members.
</P>
<P>
   Others at the dinner were Peggi and Alfred Bloom. He is
president of Swarthmore College, a small liberal arts school south
of Philadelphia where Hormel, a onetime student, serves on the
board of managers.
</P>
<P>
   The meal included a cold green soup, salmon, duck and asparagus
and a molded desert of blackberries and raspberries. Conzemius also
served a white wine from Luxembourg, a red wine and champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Guests toasted Hormel throughout the evening. Finally the
ambassador-designate raised his glass and delivered a toast to each
person there.
</P>
<P>
   His final tribute went to Wu, who teaches members of nonprofit
organizations how to raise money. Hormel thanked Wu for standing by
him through the long battle over his nomination. Hormel has said Wu
will not live with him in Luxembourg. Hormel and his former wife,
Alice Turner, were divorced after 10 years of marriage.

BANG YOUR DRUM LOUDLY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Young entrepreneurs know the rule: To get ahead, you have to be
noticed. And once you discover how, you have to make every one of
your 900 seconds of fame count.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be seen,'' said Rosalie Osias, a lawyer based in
Great Neck, N.Y. ``You have to open up the windows of opportunity,
get the people in power to notice you, mentor you, hold your hand
and teach you how. You have to network and learn the game that's
being played. There's got to be something to make the older guys in
power want to bring you into the fold.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard work, she believes, is well and good, but not nearly
enough: Attention must be paid. And she knows what she's talking
about.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, to find clients in the banking industry _ ``the
last of the old-boy networks,'' as she says _ Ms. Osias, then 37,
ran a yearlong series of provocative advertisements in industry
magazines like Mortgage Press and Mortgage Report.
</P>
<P>
   The ads showed Ms. Osias in a tuxedo and black spiked heels,
golf club in hand. Or Ms. Osias in her finest cowgirl wear,
chomping on a cigar. Or Ms. Osias in a blouse and a short skirt,
lying on a conference table, with the caption: ``Does this law firm
have a reputation? You bet it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign generated national and international interest and
outraged some other lawyers. But she says the ads helped her
attract banking clients, for whom she closes real estate deals,
from around the country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other entrepreneurs, like Justin Blair, who opened the Church
Street Gym, a health club in Manhattan, are brazen, too, but in
other ways. ``This isn't the kind of industry where you get an
internship and work your way up the corporate ladder,'' said Blair,
28. ``You need to really stand out.''
</P>
<P>
   He wanted professional boxers to train at his club, so he
created a secluded studio in a corner of his gym, complete with an
elevated boxing ring and various kinds of training equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But how could he get the attention of said athletes, who
probably hadn't heard of him?
</P>
<P>
   In January, Don King, the promoter, held a news conference at
Madison Square Garden to publicize a fight between the welterweight
champion, Felix Trinidad, and Pernell Whitaker. Blair knew that
Trinidad would be there, so he hurriedly put together packets of
information for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just snuck onto the side where Trinidad and his father were
sitting, gave him my info, and said, in broken Spanish, `This is my
place, we've got a private gym for you, and I think it's something
you can review,''' Blair said. ``I was trying to convince him that
I wasn't a freak. They were pretty cautious, but they wound up
coming down that day because they needed a place to work out. He
felt right at home, and we've been friends ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Radical schmoozing helps, too.
</P>
<P>
   At the Trinidad-Whitaker fight, Blair persuaded the stranger in
the next seat to give him his floor access pass to ``work the
influential boxing crowd.'' He promptly disappeared into that crowd
for the rest of the evening, much to the stranger's chagrin.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came back he was fuming,'' Blair said, ``but I had to
do what I had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   To get to the heavyweight champion, Evander Holyfield, Blair
gave the information to Holyfield's chiropractor, whom he found in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many layers to that onion; you never know if they
get anything, you fax it out and cross your fingers,'' Blair said.
``So you go through all the avenues.''
</P>
<P>
   His perseverance has paid off. He said his business had
quadrupled in the last six months, and Holyfield chose Church
Street to prepare for his March bout against Lennox Lewis, which
ended in a draw.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity boxers have attracted other celebrity boxers: The gym
has also been an occasional host to Mike Tyson, Larry Holmes and
the former light heavyweight champion Jose Torres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put my life savings into this gym; I spend every minute of
my time down there,'' Blair said. ``It's go big or go home.''

<P>
   JOURNAL-KOSOVO _ PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ It took our landlord's
buddy about three seconds to figure out why someone tried to break
into our apartment last week, busting the lock and our composure in
the process. Shpetim checked the broken lock, then found something
I hadn't noticed _ a small piece of wood taped to the outside of
the door above my eye line, with the name of a Serbian family
printed in pencil. The previous evening, after we discovered the
break-in attempt, we had been sufficiently nervous to look for
help. NATO troops headquartered across the street had pronounced
repeatedly their mission to provide security for all the people of
Kosovo. That very day NATO announced it had taken over police
powers, so my colleague and I sharing this apartment figured they
could swing a patrol down our street. If the troops didn't care
much about a couple of western journalists, surely they would worry
about Serbian families we found also had been targeted in our
building. Some already were leaving. Others were distraught with
fear. Wrong assumption. (Kunstel, Cox News Service).

invading French troops used the full-size clay model for crossbow
practice. Leonardo never completed the piece, which would have been
the largest equestrian sculpture in the world. Today, Leonardo's
dream, first articulated as a postage-stamp-size sketch, was
revealed in three jaw-dropping dimensions, in the form of a proudly
prancing 15-ton bronze stallion that was cast and assembled at a
foundry here, 60 miles north of New York City.

TWO US VETERANS RECALL MASSACRE DURING KOREAN WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects date of massacre in second graf to 1950)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAEGWAN, South Korea _ Forty-nine years ago, Pvt. Frederick M.
Ryan and 41 other American prisoners of war were gunned down on a
Korean hillside, their hands tied behind their backs, and left for
dead.
</P>
<P>
   A priest with the American unit that found the men kissed the
wounded Ryan's forehead, administered last rites and draped a cross
and a Purple Heart around his neck. But even though Ryan's side had
been shattered by five bullets, he was one of five soldiers who
miraculously survived the Aug. 17, 1950 massacre, their bodies
shielded by those of their dead buddies.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Ryan returned to Hill 303 _ a strategic vantage point
that changed hands at least seven times _ to find the massacre site
and to say goodbye to the ghosts of the past. Friday (June 25), on
the 49th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War, Ryan and
his fellow troops from a mortar platoon of the Army's 1st Cavalry
Division are being recognized for their sacrifice, half a century
late _ thanks to an amateur military historian from New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to say goodbye to my friends. Their bodies might not
be there, but their spirits are,'' said Ryan, 67, a retired railway
conductor, mechanic and gas station attendant from Cincinnati. ``If
I could, I'd bring them back in a minute, ``but they died that day
cussing out the other side. . .and I know they'd die again just as
they did for peace in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1950-53 Korean conflict is often called the ``forgotten
war,'' and the massacre of American POWs at Hill 303 is one of many
largely-forgotten incidents from the chaotic early months when
communist troops pushed South Korean and United Nations forces into
a 100-mile by 50-mile tip of the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   There was never a full accounting of what happened here, nor a
recognition of all the POWs. All these decades, the five survivors
themselves did not know how many had made it out alive.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Army Capt. David Kangas of Greenville, N.H., a graduate of
Fitchburg State College, who heard about the mass execution in 1985
when he was posted at Camp Carroll, where the 1st Cavalry was
based. Kangas asked around the base, and then at the Korean War
Museum in town, and found that no one knew anything about it. The
few historical accounts were sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   So he launched a ``needle-in-a-haystack'' search through
historical accounts, contemporary news reports and the National
Archives, hoping to find clues. The massacre had prompted Gen.
Douglas MacArthur to drop leaflets over North Korean territory
warning that soldiers would be held accountable for war crimes. But
it was all but forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I finally found the area of the execution site, I said,
`Someday, I will find the survivors _ someday.' It was an act of
faith,'' recalled Kangas, 42.
</P>
<P>
   Official records of the massacre were incomplete. Ryan, for one,
was declared dead at the hill, and those accounts were never
corrected when the 18-year-old recruit recovered. A government
documents building in St. Louis burned down in the 1960s, taking
records of that day with it. The unknown survivors, never knew how
to correct the record, or even that they could. It was Kangas, once
he found the men, who launched a personal campaign to get them
recognized for POW benefits and medals.
</P>
<P>
   But first, he had to find them. Nearly a decade after Kangas
began his search, another war history enthusiast read an interview
with him in a New Jersey newspaper and linked him up with Ryan and
the two other remaining survivors, re-uniting the men for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me Fred was dead. They told me I was the sole
survivor,'' said former Pfc. Roy Manring, 67, a retired maintenance
worker from New Albany, Ind. who drove several hours to Ryan's
house in Ohio the day he learned his friend was alive.
</P>
<P>
   Manring was shot 13 times and spent 18 months in hospitals in
Korea, Japan and the United States. ``I tried to forget about it. .
. I didn't want to talk to anyone about it except my wife. My kids
knew I was an ex-POW, but they didn't know what I had been
through.''
</P>
<P>
   The time for forgetting ended when Manring met up again with
Ryan and former Pvt. James M. Rudd of Salyerville, Ky. First they
were awarded the POW medal and other honors. This year, they were
invited and sponsored by South Korean veterans and US soldiers at
Camp Carroll to come back to identify the massacre site for a
memorial. Rudd was too ill to make the journey. Ryan, who fears
flying, had vowed never to board a plane again after leaving Korea
_ except if it was to come back.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan and Manring spent the day trudging around the forgotten
hillside, now covered with vineyards and partly dug up for a tunnel
under construction. After hours in the sun, pouring water over
themselves and comparing the much-changed terrain to their memories
of mortar emplacements and lookout points, Manring froze, fell to
his knees on a rock and said he knew this was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was laying right here after they shot me,'' he said with a
shudder. His grandfather appeared to him and ``put his arm on my
shoulder and said, `They're coming back, get out of here.''' When
Manring struggled up, he was shot five more times by an approaching
American unit that couldn't identify his ragged uniform. The
victims had been 15 minutes shy of being saved.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre was the culmination of three days of captivity for
67 Americans, Manring and Ryan say, during which the North Koreans
tied them together and moved them constantly. The first night, 10
of the POWs were taken away with shovels _ presumably to dig their
own graves _ and never returned. A few escaped overnight, but the
second day, when one soldier slipped on the hillside and briefly
separated from the others, the angry captors decapitated him with a
trench-digging tool.
</P>
<P>
   After taking some minutes by himself in the gulley, Manring
whispered, ``I talked to the boys. I hope I'm at peace now. I
begged their forgiveness. I have dreams about them all the time. I
feel guilty that I survived.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, trying to locate the spot where he was shot, recalled
being shielded by the body of a 6-foot-3, 280-pound fellow soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as the North Koreans turned around, I shook the guy on
top of me, but he didn't respond. Then I got up and lifted my
friend Hernandez. He told me to get down, they were coming back. I
didn't talk to him 30 seconds before he died in my arms, and I
started crying,'' Ryan remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said he stayed alive by thinking of his mother, his
girlfriend, and the chocolate malts at his favorite soda shop in
his hometown of Dayton, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   The emotion of being in the spot where he almost died finally
overcame Manring. ``I'm going to tell you something I've hardly
told anyone,'' he began softly. ``I shot a little Korean girl _ she
was maybe 8 or 10 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Manring recounted that his platoon was approached one day by a
group of refugees, but when he took out his binoculars, he saw a
girl holding a grenade in her hands, and no pin in it, headed their
way. Before she had a chance to throw it, ``I put a bullet in
between her eyes,'' he said, sobbing. ``She bothers me to this day.
. . I've got a half-Korean granddaughter, and when she gets hurt,
it always brings that back to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When Manring and his platoon ran over to the group, killed by
the girl's exploded grenade, 12 of the 16 had Communist North
Korean uniforms on under their civilian clothes, he said.

 VW SHIFTS GEARS IN LATEST JETTA  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Volkswagen's compact Jetta is one of the big success
stories of the '90s. Without fanfare, Jetta has become the
top-selling European vehicle in North America, as well as VW's most
popular model.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly, Jetta was little more than a Golf (or earlier Rabbit)
with a trunk. Now in its fourth generation, the completely restyled
'99 Jetta has an attractive new body with the aero look of the
bigger Passat, becoming more distinctive while retaining its
mission as a sophisticated and value-laden small car.
</P>
<P>
   As its ``Driver's Wanted'' ad campaign notes, Volkswagen aspires
to build sporty road cars for spirited driving. In recent years, VW
has earned the reputation as a proletariat BMW, bringing to the
midpriced car arena something of the solid structure, precise
handling and tactile interiors of the expensive Germanic machines.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, I was somewhat perplexed by the new Jetta GLS. Unlike
the taut, precise VWs that I've known and loved, the new Jetta
feels too soft, wallowing on its suspension and leaning heavily in
turns.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I thought the brakes felt spongy, not at all like the firm
and quick acting four-wheel discs that I've experienced in other
VWs.
</P>
<P>
   The steering was still precise, though, and the solid,
rattle-free body felt familiar. But even equipped with VW's
sparkling VR6 engine, the Jetta lacked the driving excitement that
I had expected.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first year the VW has put the VR6 in any Jetta
except the top-end GLX. Our test GLS was so equipped, hooked up to
one of VW's smooth-shifting five-speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The V-6's silky power and explosive delivery is loads of fun,
but the test car was hampered by too much torque steer _ the
tendency for a front-drive car to pull to the side under
acceleration. This also was an unexpected phenomenon that I've not
experienced in past VWs to any great degree.
</P>
<P>
   And that mushy suspension seemed ill-equipped to deal with the
engine's potential.
</P>
<P>
   Despite my complaints. the Jetta is still a likable little car
that I enjoyed driving and hated to see go away. While the
suspension may be too soft, it does provide a luxury ride that some
people may find preferable to European-style firmness. Maybe the
idea here is to go a bit more mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The styling is a variation on the handsome Passat, Jetta's
bigger sibling, with the rounded modernist shape that has quickly
become VW's hallmark. The design evokes everything from the A6 or
A8 by Audi, VW's upscale partner, to the unlikely star of last
season, the New Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Jetta also shares some other facets of its Volkswagen/Audi
brethren. It rides on the same platform as the Golf, the New Beetle
and Audi's upcoming TT sports coupe, as well as several other
products sold only overseas. This is a good, rigid foundation that
enhances drivability and ride quality.
</P>
<P>
   The interior has taken a big dose of Beetle-mania, with textured
surfaces and a rounded-off set of gauges that glow blue at night.
Very nice stuff, accentuating the sophisticated aura in a fairly
unconventional way. Considering the moderate price tag, there's
lots in here to like.
</P>
<P>
   The Jetta is roomy and comfortable, with thronelike seating and
plenty of headroom front and rear. Front seat legroom is fine, but
rear-seat passengers may feel a bit pinched.
</P>
<P>
   In VW fashion, the switches, levers, buttons and controls are
simple and solid. Gauges and components are well-integrated, giving
the Jetta's interior a feeling of being more expensive than it is.
</P>
<P>
   Among its rivals, Jetta may not possess the towering reputation
for reliability of Toyota or Honda, but it has shown itself to be a
durable little machine. And its image is just offbeat enough to
attract the attention of young people, and appeal to older drivers
who want something that stands apart from the neighbors' Honda
Accords, Ford Tauruses or Toyota Camrys.
</P>
<P>
   The GLS comes completely equipped for the base price, included
all power features, cruise control and air-conditioning. Anti-lock
brakes and side air bags also are standard.
</P>
<P>
   The only options on our GLS was the so-called luxury package for
$1,000, which includes power sunroof, locking alloy wheels and
heated seats with adjustable lumbar. Another $850 added on leather
seating and steering-wheel rim.
</P>
<P>
   The Jetta comes standard with a 115 horsepower, four-cylinder
gasoline engine, which gets the job done without fuss. A GLS
powered by VW's remarkable TDI diesel engine will soon be
available, with its 49-miles-per-gallon fuel efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Prices start at around $17,000, not cheap for a compact, but not
bad when you consider the standard equipment and stylish design.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, VW will get the Jetta's suspension and brakes back on
course, backing up its ``Drivers wanted'' slogan with a real
driver's machine. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With Old World rivals like Paris and Berlin and New
World rivals like Seattle and Silicon Valley, New York City can
hardly claim to be the brain capital of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But you wouldn't necessarily know that from all the talking
going on. Call them seminars or lectures or discussions, but the
city is truly brimming with forums for the thinking man, woman and
child. In any given week an intrepid ideas-seeker can find serious
discussions about everything from the growing presence of Islam in
America to the social history of popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   Want to know how to cross-hybridize corn? There are talks at the
Brooklyn Botanic Garden. How about an in-depth look at democracy in
Cuba? Check out the Brecht Forum on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of Barnes &AMP; Noble and other supersize bookstores,
literary discussion groups are meeting regularly to chat about
Vietnam novels and science fiction and New Age tomes. Then there
are the literary fan clubs, societies devoted to the work of late
great authors like Yeats and Dickens.
</P>
<P>
   Last week alone a New Yorker could find dozens of people sitting
down to learn about Surrealist film, beach erosion and the history
of marriage from a feminist perspective. There were appearances by
seminar stars like Stephen Jay Gould, the historian, who can pack a
room on a topic like ``The Impossibility of Historical
Prediction,'' and celebrity lecturers like Philip Glass, the
composer whose talent for artful digression rivals that of many
more experienced speakers.
</P>
<P>
   All of this tossing about of ideas gives rise to a curious
question: Could one, by visiting many of these lectures and
listening closely enough, pick up some sense of the city's
intellectual zeitgeist?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is no. To be sure, there is plenty of
millennial reflection going on right now, and more than a few
speakers tossing around words like ``calendric'' and ``fin de
siecle.''
</P>
<P>
   But rather than indicating a common theme, this profusion of
talkers and listeners testifies instead to the city's enormously
varied intellectual appetite. It also shows off the city as a place
where people with specific interests _ sometimes, exceedingly
specific _ can find like-minded folk to commune with.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is an account of a weeklong survey of the city's
educated chatter.
</P>
<P>
   The first stop, as any lecture junkie will tell you, was bound
to be a big-time bookstore. Hoping to lure buyers into the stacks,
chains like Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders Books have been aggressive
about scheduling authors with new books to discuss and read from
their work.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the choices included a speaker on the history of
coffee at Barnes &AMP; Noble on the Upper East Side and a discussion of
the work of Bernhard Schlink at the Barnes &AMP; Noble in Forest Hills,
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   No. And no. Instead, my choice was a lecture by Paul Levinson, a
professor of communications history and philosophy at Fordham
University, whose most recent book is ``Digital McLuhan,'' a look
at the lasting influence of Marshall McLuhan in the age of the
Internet. The locale was a Borders at the World Trade Center, with
an audience of about 40, including a man who slept before, during
and after the event.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson, flanked by stacks of photography books and others
merely labeled ``Art,'' expounded on likenesses between the
futuristic visions of McLuhan, who invented the term Global
Village, and today's World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``McLuhan was not able to write on the Web, but his approach was
Weblike,'' Levinson said, citing McLuhan's propensity for short
chapters and nonlinear thought in his books. The comments drew a
round of emphatic nods.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would Marshall McLuhan have said about the Internet and
the Web?'' Levinson said. ``It's impossible to say.'' He paused and
added with a laugh: ``Except that he would have had a lot to say
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's schedule was to begin early, with a 7:30 a.m. talk
with the television commentator Cokie Roberts at the 92nd Street Y.
But upon arriving, I discovered a sacred rule of the intellectual
set: They like to sleep late. The event had been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The 92nd Street Y is one of the city's premier temples of talk,
a list that includes the New York Public Library, the Asia Society
and the Pierpont Morgan Library, which has a series of afternoon
discussions. And while summer may be a slow time for the city's
colleges and universities, they generally offer countless lectures
that are open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Many churches and museums also offer issue-oriented events. Ms.
Roberts, in fact, would make an appearance at Trinity Church later
that afternoon, speaking on religion and politics.
</P>
<P>
   For true intellectual heft, however, perhaps few spots can rival
the Brecht Forum, where Gould spoke on Tuesday night. The first
words I heard upon entering were ``imperialist dialectic
interpretation of history.''
</P>
<P>
   The forum is on the 10th floor of 122 W. 27th St. in Manhattan,
a loft space where papier mache wall hangings and pamphlets jockey
for visitors' attention.
</P>
<P>
   Gould had drawn a standing-room-only crowd dotted with older men
with ponytails, older women with spectacles and graduate student
types scribbling notes on legal pads. The amiable Gould, with a
pair of glasses hung around his neck, hit upon Karl Marx's funeral
(``Only nine people were there''), the year 2000 (``a wonderfully
arbitrary transition'') and Yogi Berra's wisdom (``The future ain't
what it used to be'') before finally alighting on his thesis: that
people, especially scientists, are terrible at predicting the
future.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Gould told the story of an early chairman of
Mercedes-Benz who once predicted that Europe would never sustain
more than a million cars. The reason? That the Continent's
citizenry could only ever produce a million chauffeurs.
</P>
<P>
   Gould's point was that the underlying biases of class, race and
economics often skewed any possibility of prognostication.
``Scientific biases prevent accurate prediction,'' he said. ``And
always have.''
</P>
<P>
   There was much scribbling as I left.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The next stop was the Kitchen, the venerable experimental
theater space on West 19th Street, the site of a batch of
summertime lectures by members of the Kitchen's artistic family.
</P>
<P>
   The seats were nearly all filled with a younger crowd than that
at the Brecht Forum. The lights dimmed theatrically as Glass
approached a small table draped in black and lighted by a single
overhead spotlight. He immediately said that his lecture, titled
``Collaboration and the New Technology,'' presented a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made up the title months ago,'' Glass said. ``Now, I've had
to figure out what it was about.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a voice barely above a burble, Glass touched on the
miraculous technology of the piano (see lecture title), and his
artistic collaborations (see lecture title) with everyone from
Jerome Robbins to Martin Scorsese. But the most absorbing moments
came when Glass' focus strayed a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``CD-ROM is already on the way out,'' he said at one point,
seeming alarmed and amused all at once. ``Did you know that?''
</P>
<P>
   Or: ``I've noticed my cat doesn't watch television. Does
yours?''
</P>
<P>
   Or: ``The only place the composer is the boss is in the opera
house. That's why I write so many operas.''
</P>
<P>
   At evening's end a young composer asked Glass' advice about the
profession. Glass puzzled for a bit and finally answered: ``Think
what you could do that would make your teachers really angry. That
would probably be the most interesting thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The following night I tried a couple of the city's newer venues,
the two-year-old Newseum and Joe's Pub, the recently opened cabaret
spot at the Public Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The Newseum auditorium is a sleek Madison Avenue lecture hall
popular with that famously loquacious breed, the journalist.
Booking reporters as speakers has its drawbacks, of course; a talk
on Monday by the photojournalist Harry Benson was canceled when he
was called away on assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Thomas, veteran White House correspondent and recent
author of a memoir, spoke about her experiences. Beltway
reminiscences ensued: of Lyndon B. Johnson, who ``couldn't stand
anybody speaking for him''; Hillary Clinton, who ``just hates the
press''; and President Clinton, who ``has been very nice to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, unswayed by Ms. Thomas' assertion that reporters
shouldn't be celebrities, ate it up.
</P>
<P>
   Joe's Pub, which usually presents music, turned literary
Wednesday with a selection of readings from The New Yorker's latest
fiction issue. Special attractions included celebrity readers,
girls in slinky dresses looking to impress New Yorker editors and
lots of cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   The final evening of talk, Thursday, highlights what may be the
seminar scene's most important contribution to the city's
intellectual landscape: bringing together people with particular
interests. At the Lesbian and Gay Community Center in the West
Village, for example, E.J. Graff, a writer, discussed same-sex
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Then at Borders Books at East 57th Street and Park Avenue, four
African-American authors gathered to discuss the topic of ``The
Importance of Writing About Contemporary Black Life.'' The audience
was almost exclusively black, a marked change from most of the
other events I attended. One at a time, each author discussed
pressing issues for black artists, including stereotyping by
publishers and the complications of success for blacks in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started writing because I wanted to write about where we are
now,'' said Benilde Little, a novelist. ``We are the most educated,
most affluent, and probably the most confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Events like this, she said, offer an opportunity to reflect on
those confusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a community where we can be ourselves,'' Ms.
Little said, ``drop the masks and let our hair down.''

CALIFORNIA A PROVING GROUND FOR BUSH CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 27)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Gov. George W. Bush takes his presidential
campaign of broad themes to California this week, he may run into
the types of hard issues that can confound a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the early front-runner for the Republican nomination, has
been traveling around the nation all month gathering support and
money for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop is California, a state that once was revered
Reagan country and now is seen by many as a must-win for the
Democrats in the 2000 presidential race. It is a trove for a
presidential candidate: A state with more than 30 million people
and 54 electoral votes, and a political climate that runs from the
conservative Central Valley to the liberal San Francisco Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats won California's top post last year when Gray Davis
was elected governor after 16 years of Republican leadership.
Meanwhile, Republicans still are trying to recover from the two
terms of Davis' predecessor, Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything Governor Bush can do to distance himself from Wilson
will be very beneficial,'' said Barbara O'Connor, director of the
Institute for the Study of Politics and Media at California State
University in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Initiatives backed by Wilson such as Proposition 187, which
denied education and medical benefits to illegal immigrants,
alienated Hispanics. And with more than a million Hispanic voters
in California, that poses a challenge for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposes California's Proposition 187, and he has criticized
proposals to wall off the United States from Mexico. He touts his
ability to reach out to minorities by pointing out he captured a
significant number of Hispanic voters in Texas _ as much as 49
percent of the Hispanic vote _ in his re-election last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Although he criticizes the ``politics of division,'' he has
stopped short of personally blasting Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue George Bush is going to face in California is
distancing himself from the politics of Governor Wilson,'' said
Harry Pachon, president of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute in Los
Angeles. ``And I think he has already done that to some degree.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish-speaking Bush's more moderate message could attract
some Hispanics to the Republican fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be some very fertile ground for him to plow,'' Pachon
said of the Hispanic voter in California.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also may run into trouble in California on two other thorny
issues: guns and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Cain, a political science professor at the University of
California at Berkeley, noted that in last year's election, the GOP
candidates for governor and U.S. Senate lost to Democrats on those
two issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both were pro-guns and anti-choice, and Democrats blew them
out of the water in California,'' Cain said. ``It's very hard for a
Republican to win, if he is pro-guns and anti-choice, and that's a
big challenge for Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest and the
mother's life. On the presidential campaign trail, he has said he
would not impose an abortion litmus test on his judicial selections
or his choice for vice president. As governor, he signed
legislation requiring parents to be notified before a daughter can
get an abortion, hailing it a measure that would decrease the
number of abortions in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he supports the right to bear arms, and he signed
legislation barring cities from suing gun manufacturers to recover
medical treatment costs related to gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard for Bush to get his message of ``compassionate
conservatism'' across to California voters credibly, if he is
pressed hard on the abortion and gun issues, Cain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question now is: Can someone who is anti-choice and
pro-guns win statewide. The suspicion is the answer is no. That's
the million-dollar question for George Bush,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cain and others believe Bush so far is looking like a winner for
the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people share the general natural (national)
infatuation with him at this point,'' Cain said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some people are supporting Bush not because they necessarily
like his ideology, but because they believe he is only Republican
who can recapture the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (support) is pretty shallow right now,'' Cain said. ``We
really don't know much about him. The tide could shift, if there
are a series of disasters.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, Bush does not enjoy the same strong lead over
Vice President Al Gore, the Democrats' front-runner, that he does
in other states. A recent poll showed the two in a statistical dead
heat in California.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is still doing well in the state that Gore has been
scrupulous to keep on his radar screen. (Gore made his 57th trip to
California as vice president on Wednesday and Thursday.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gore absolutely has to win California,'' O'Connor
said.

Angeles. ``And I think he has already done that to some degree.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish-speaking Bush's more moderate message could attract
some Hispanics to the Republican fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be some very fertile ground for him to plow,'' Pachon
said of the Hispanic voter in California.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also may run into trouble in California on two other thorny
issues: guns and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Cain, a political science professor at the University of
California at Berkeley, noted that in last year's election, the GOP
candidates for governor and U.S. Senate lost to Democrats on those
two issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both were pro-guns and anti-choice, and Democrats blew them
out of the water in California,'' Cain said. ``It's very hard for a
Republican to win, if he is pro-guns and anti-choice, and that's a
big challenge for Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest and the
mother's life. On the presidential campaign trail, he has said he
would not impose an abortion litmus test on his judicial selections
or his choice for vice president. As governor, he signed
legislation requiring parents to be notified before a daughter can
get an abortion, hailing it a measure that would decrease the
number of abortions in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he supports the right to bear arms, and he signed
legislation barring cities from suing gun manufacturers to recover
medical treatment costs related to gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard for Bush to get his message of ``compassionate
conservatism'' across to California voters credibly, if he is
pressed hard on the abortion and gun issues, Cain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question now is: Can someone who is anti-choice and
pro-guns win statewide. The suspicion is the answer is no. That's
the million-dollar question for George Bush,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cain and others believe Bush so far is looking like a winner for
the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people share the general natural (national)
infatuation with him at this point,'' Cain said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some people are supporting Bush not because they necessarily
like his ideology, but because they believe he is only Republican
who can recapture the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (support) is pretty shallow right now,'' Cain said. ``We
really don't know much about him. The tide could shift, if there
are a series of disasters.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, Bush does not enjoy the same strong lead over
Vice President Al Gore, the Democrats' front-runner, that he does
in other states. A recent poll showed the two in a statistical dead
heat in California.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is still doing well in the state that Gore has been
scrupulous to keep on his radar screen. (Gore made his 57th trip to
California as vice president on Wednesday and Thursday.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gore absolutely has to win California,'' O'Connor
said.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, June 25 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: STEEL
</P>
<P>
   Voting 42-57, the Senate on Tuesday blocked debate on a measure
that would have imposed limits on steel imports into the United
States. The bill was a response to the foreign steel that has
flooded the U.S. market in the wake of the Asian financial crisis.
Supporters said it was necessary to discuss the bill because the
import limits were needed to protect the U.S. steel industry from
unfair trade practices. Opponents said the quotas would violate
international trade laws and cause other countries to retaliate
against U.S. exports. A ``yes'' vote favors continuing debate on
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: HEALTH
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday failed to pass an amendment that would
have added the Democrat's managed-care reform proposal to an
agriculture spending bill. Voting 53-47, the Senate tabled, or set
aside, the proposal. The failure of the amendment led to a halt in
further consideration of the agriculture bill because Democrats
threatened to keep offering parts of the proposal as amendments
until the issue is addressed. Opponents of tabling the measure said
it is time for the Senate to address legislation that could remedy
the problems faced by patients when dealing with their health care
providers. Supporters of tabling the measure said the Democrat's
plan does not adequately address those problems. A ``yes'' vote
favors tabling the measure.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: SAFETY
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, June 18, the House approved, 311-115, an amendment to
a larger gun legislation package that would have required handguns
be sold with child safety locks or storage devices. But the
amendment did not pass out of the House because the gun package was
defeated. Supporters said the measure would protect children from
accidental deaths and injuries by handguns. No members rose in
opposition. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: D.C.BAN
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, June 18, the House rejected, 175-250, an amendment to
a larger gun legislation package that would have repealed the
District of Columbia's law that prevents residents from owning
firearms. Supporters said D.C. residents deserve the same Second
Amendment rights as other Americans. Opponents said the gun ban is
important to the safety of D.C. residents and that Congress does
not have any business overriding their gun laws. A ``yes'' vote
favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: D.C.GUNS
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, June 18, the House approved, 213-208, an amendment to
a larger gun legislation package that would permit law-abiding
District of Columbia residents to keep a handgun at home and to
carry an unloaded weapon. But the amendment did not pass out of the
House because the gun legislation package was defeated. Supporters
of the amendment said D.C. residents should have the same rights as
other Americans and should be able to protect themselves if an
intruder invades their home. Opponents said Congress does not have
any business overriding D.C.'s gun laws. A ``yes'' vote favors the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: GUNS
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, June 18, the House rejected, 147-280, gun legislation
intended to limit the accessibility of guns to criminals and
children. The package included measures that would require 24-hour
background checks for purchases at guns shows, ban the import of
large-ammunition clips and require safety locks to be sold with
handguns. Supporters said the bill was an effective way to keep
firearms away from criminals and children without compromising the
rights of law-abiding gun owners. Democratic opponents said the
legislation was too watered-down and would actually weaken current
gun laws while conservative opponents said gun control was not the
answer to the recent episodes of violence. A ``yes'' vote favors
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: FLAG
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 305-124, an amendment to the
U.S. Constitution that would prohibit ``physical desecration'' of
the American flag. This is the third time that the House has
successfully garnered the two-thirds vote necessary to pass the
amendment. Now it goes to the Senate, where it has failed in the
past. Supporters said the flag is a national symbol that needs to
be protected. Opponents said flag desecration is a form of free
speech and therefore a guaranteed right under the First Amendment.
A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   6) BILL NUMBER: SEIZE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 375-48, a bill that will make it
harder for law enforcement officials to seize private property that
is suspected of being connected to crimes. Supporters said law
enforcement officials have abused their power in recent years to
seize property before criminal charges are filed. Opponents said
the measure goes too far, and would make it more difficult to fight
crime. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.

NASCAR season literally go up in smoke. A year ago, Spencer, 42, of
Berwick, Pa., was ninth in the points standings heading into Sears
Point Raceway, the first of two road-course events on the Winston
Cup circuit. When the Winston Cup series makes its annual stop in
the San Francisco area on Sunday, however, Spencer will find
himself 29th in points, trailing leader Dale Jarrett by a whopping
1,056. Spencer's main problem has been blown engines, and his
sponsor, Winston cigarettes, says it won't be back next season.
However, Jimmy Spencer says last week's top five finish has
rejuvenated his campaign. (Schlabach, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

HINDU PRIEST GIVEN PROBATION IN SEX ASSAULT DENIED BAIL ON NEW
CHARGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE BREWER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Hindu priest given probation earlier this week after
being convicted of the sexual assault of an Arkansas woman who
sought his spiritual guidance was denied bail Friday on a new
charge of assaulting another woman.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Ted Poe's ruling will keep Bhogeshwernand
Sharma in the county jail, even though Sharma has filed a notice of
appeal and is entitled to post bond while appealing his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma, 37, was given 10 years probation by a jury Wednesday for
the April 3, 1998, sexual assault of a 21-year-old Little Rock,
Ark., college student at his Harris County home.
</P>
<P>
   The woman says Sharma assaulted her when she and her mother came
to Houston to visit him and his family. She said he bullied her
into sex under the pretext that it was a religious ritual to
``cleanse her womb'' with his ``holy sperm.''
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old's mother and aunt testified that Sharma had done
the same thing to them when he was in Arkansas in September 1997
and that he told them bad things would happen if they talked about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma has not been charged in Arkansas, but the two women were
allowed to tell their stories to jurors in the 21-year-old's case
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   As a condition of probation, Poe ordered Sharma to serve 180
days in jail. Sharma's attorney in the April 1998 case, Katherine
Scardino, filed the notice of appeal shortly after Sharma's court
appearance Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, that notice qualifies Sharma for an appeal bail
and means he won't have to live under the terms of his probation
until a higher court decides the case.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly before the jury gave Sharma probation Wednesday,
prosecutor Kelly Siegler filed a new charge against him.
</P>
<P>
   That charge alleges that he sexually assaulted a 20-year-old
Hindu woman in Houston on Jan. 6 _ days before he was charged for
the April 1998 assault _ using the same tactics.
</P>
<P>
   That woman says Sharma impregnated her and that she had an
abortion, Siegler said. Her family also says Sharma's relatives
talked them out of going public sooner.
</P>
<P>
   So, if Sharma is able to raise money for an appeal bail, it
would probably do him little good because he is going to be held
without bail on the new charge.
</P>
<P>
   Making his situation worse, once Sharma had filed his notice of
appeal, he stopped getting credit for serving time on the 180 days
Poe ordered him to do as part of the probation.
</P>
<P>
   That means Sharma stays in jail, but gets no credit toward the
jail time and will begin serving it only when _ and if _ his appeal
fails.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side for Sharma, the appeal notice means that a jury
in the new case won't be allowed to hear of his conviction in the
assault on the 21-year-old Arkansas woman.
</P>
<P>
   But they could be allowed to hear the facts of that case,
including testimony from the young woman, her mother, her aunt and
yet another woman who recently contacted Siegler and said she had
also been assaulted by Sharma.
</P>
<P>
   Siegler asked Poe on Friday to deny bail to Sharma on the new
charge because he had been seen in a local passport office days
after he was charged in the April 1998 assault.
</P>
<P>
   That resulted in the revocation of his bail then, and Siegler
told Poe on Friday she's afraid Sharma will flee the country if he
is freed.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma tried to talk to the judge about the allegation he had
tried to flee in January, but Poe told him to remain quiet. Poe
said he would review the ``no bail'' status in the new case in 60
days.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma told Poe on Friday that he had no money for a lawyer to
represent him in the new case. So Poe may have to appoint him a new
lawyer, and possibly an appellate attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Poe will address that issue and the amount of the appeal bond at
a July 2 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Scardino, who was not with Sharma when he appeared Friday, said
she has talked to his family about continuing to represent him
again, but was unsure if that would happen.
</P>
<P>
   Until the issue of his legal representation is cleared up, Poe
appointed defense lawyer Rachel Capote on an interim basis to
represent Sharma in the new case.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Natan Sharansky, the Russian immigrant leader, will
be the next interior minister, wresting control of the powerful
ministry from the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, which has held it for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky, whose party campaigned for the Interior Ministry,
signed an agreement Friday to join the coalition government of
Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak. The settlers' National Religious
Party did, too, with a promise of the Housing Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   As coalition talks accelerated, those were the first finalized
moves in what has been an arduous five-week-long process. A writer
for the newspaper Maariv, Chemi Shalev, described it as a political
``boot camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who defeated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the
election on May 17, has until July 9 to form a government. He has
been striving to forge a broad-based coalition that would absorb
the opposition, principally Shas and the Likud Party, now led by
Ariel Sharon, the departing foreign minister. Some commentators
have questioned Barak's desire to build such a broad coalition,
wondering whether it would constrain his ability to put his
external and domestic peacemaking plans in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more partners he swallows, the greater the danger they
will end up swallowing him,'' Nahum Barnea, a political columnist
for the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, wrote this week.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak reportedly believes that by bringing opposition
parties inside his government, mostly on his terms, he will both
neutralize them and create a consensus for difficult decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts predict that Sharon will be appointed finance
minister and that David Levy, who was foreign minister under
Netanyahu, will be foreign minister again.
</P>
<P>
   In Barak's Labor Party, there is much grumbling about that
scenario. Labor will be sidelined, and the new government will not
represent enough of a break with the past, they say, if two former
ministers of Netanyahu hold important positions.
</P>
<P>
   Shas is upset, too, by Barak's decision to give the Interior
Ministry to Sharansky. Israel Radio reported that Shas leaders were
going to break off their negotiations with the prime minister-elect
and said the leaders were turning to Aryeh Deri, their former
leader, for counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Deri, who was convicted of corruption in the spring, had stepped
down as leader so that he would not hobble Shas' chances of joining
the government.

   More Years for Heirs To Benefit From IRAs &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service has approved a significant tax
break for some people who want to leave the money in their
Individual Retirement Accounts to two or three generations of
heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ruling, each heir may use her own life expectancy to
determine the rate at which money must be withdrawn and taxes paid
on the withdrawals, said Seymour Goldberg, a tax lawyer in Garden
City, N.Y., who obtained the private-letter ruling for his clients.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, tax lawyers had been advising clients that payouts to
all heirs had to be based on the life expectancy of the oldest
heir.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling means years or decades of additional tax-sheltered
growth of IRA assets for young heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ruling, an IRA that was left to six heirs ranging in
age from 48 to 61 will no longer tie all heirs' payouts to the
23-year life expectancy of the oldest heir. For the 48-year-old,
that means about 12 extra years over which to withdraw the IRA
assets, with the balance continuing to grow, sheltered from taxes,
for all of those years. ``Had a grandchild been involved, it could
have been 70 years,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, to be disclosed officially Aug. 6, applies only to
IRA owners who die before they must take their first payouts.

   What? A mere million dollars? Such a bundle may no longer be
enough to qualify its lucky owner as wealthy _ even if the person
you ask about the cutoff point is the one with the million. When
Neuberger &AMP; Berman, the investment management and mutual fund
company, surveyed 204 affluent Americans about their attitudes
toward wealth and estate planning, it found that many respondents
set a higher bar.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey, to be released Monday, 44 percent said the word
``wealth'' would not apply to a personal stash of less than $1
million to $5 million, and an additional 29 percent set the minimum
at $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   That thinking may not be shared by Americans at the median
income level _ $37,000 for a household _ but the survey
concentrated on people who met a fairly common current definition
of affluence: annual household income of at least $125,000 and/or
assets of $500,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Affluent they may be, but many respondents were under no
illusions that a modest fortune qualified as keeping up with the
Gateses. Almost half _ 49 percent _ of those with assets of more
than $1 million said they did not view themselves as wealthy. &QL;

<P>
   DALLAS _ Managed care and government cost-cutting are forcing
medical schools to retrench. But Dr. Kern Wildenthal can point out
the window of his 11th-floor conference room here to the three
medical research towers he has built over the last five years at
the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center _ and describe
plans for three more. The buildings and programs they house reflect
his talent for separating Texans from their millions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm astonished at the amount of money Southwestern has been
able to raise from wealthy individuals,'' said Dr. Maxwell Cowan,
chief scientific officer of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in
Chevy Chase, Md., and an expert on medical center finances.
``Because of changes in government funding of Medicare and
Medicaid, such institutions will find it necessary to rely on
private funding as they never have before.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Wildenthal, 57, became president of Southwestern in 1986,
it has drawn 6 of the 10 largest gifts ever given to a public
medical school. Ross Perot and Harold C. Simmons, a billionaire
from corporate takeovers and raids, have given close to $50 million
each, and other Texans have donated $450 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy,
Southwestern received more private money than any other academic
medical center except the University of California at San
Francisco, a beneficiary of Silicon Valley's largess.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Wildenthal made fund-raising his priority. He
met and cultivated Dallas' wealthy. Then he used their donations to
attract renowned scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Four Nobel Prize winners are on the faculty of Southwestern _
the only medical school with so many _ along with eight other
members of the National Academy of Sciences. All are vital in
attracting research grants _ $167 million in 1998, up from $36
million in 1983 _ which, in turn, attract more top faculty and
private gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Wildenthal became president the year after two faculty members,
Joseph Goldstein and Michael Brown, gave the center its first
Nobel, for research into how the body processes cholesterol. Their
work had already drawn Perot's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Wildenthal has managed to keep these researchers so happy that
they have rejected other offers, and Perot so happy that he has
donated $25 million to Goldstein's department over the years plus
$19 million for scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you guys produce results, I'll keep sending you
checks,'' Perot has told the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Wildenthal was born in San Marcos, Texas, near Austin, and in
1964 received his MD from Southwestern, where, by law, 90 percent
of the students must be Texans. He then was a Guggenheim fellow at
Cambridge, where he earned a PhD. Returning to Southwestern as a
professor in 1970, he became dean of the medical school in 1980,
when he was only 38. Six years later, he became chief of the
center, which includes three hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   He was regarded as a far more promising Mr. Inside than Mr.
Outside. ``He didn't seem to have the schmoozing personality that
goes with the role of fund-raiser,'' Goldstein recalled. ``But
then, he also doesn't have the salesmanlike quality that a lot of
philanthropists are skeptical of.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his soft-spoken manner and candid approach are what
philanthropists find appealing. ``This may lead to a cure 30 years
from now, or it may not lead to a cure,'' Wildenthal often warns.
``So understand what you're investing in.''
</P>
<P>
   He had barely started as president when the state cut its annual
contribution sharply. ``We had no fund-raising structure,'' he
recalled. ``No staff. No mailing list. We needed money right away,
not 10 years from now. I decided I could either ask a million
people for 10 dollars each or 10 people for a million dollars
each.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on 10 of Dallas's wealthiest people, most of whom he
had only read about, and asked each for $1 million or more. They
were impressed with his style. ``He is very good at expressing how
your money helps the medical school grow and how private money is
the seed money that attracts government grants,'' said Simmons, who
has given chiefly to research in arthritis, which he has, and
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   As the gifts poured in, the city's rich began to embrace
Wildenthal and his wife, Marnie. An expert in fine wine and opera,
he entertained them in the manner to which they were accustomed and
took care to show up at their fund-raising events for other causes.
</P>
<P>
   In a city whose premier exemplars of national excellence wore
helmets and shoulder pads, they were eager for the different kind
of recognition that Wildenthal and his scholars were winning.
</P>
<P>
   His intimacy with Dallas society helps him match the school's
needs with likely donors. ``You have to really know the people and
find out what they're interested in,'' he said. ``Is it cancer?
Mental health?''
</P>
<P>
   The city's social columns are clipped for him daily, and he
never forgets a major donor's birthday or a prime social event. But
when he works a room, he avoids the overly familiar approach.
``Backslapping,'' he said, ``is not a part of fund-raising to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he usually lets the donor decide the amount to give. But
that may understate both his business savvy and his directness,
according to one major donor who explained, ``He is a master at
figuring out the maximum you can afford to give _ and then asking
for exactly that amount.''

INVESTING DIGEST, WITH FUNDS WATCH AND MARKETS

   FUNDS WATCH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Active Managers Can Hold Their Heads High &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Has the tide turned in favor of active equity fund managers in
their continuing battle with index funds? Perhaps, if just for the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   From March 31 through last Thursday, all types of general equity
funds, on average, outperformed the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index funds, according to Lipper Inc., the research firm in Summit,
N.J. The index funds returned 2.44 percent, lagging behind every
other type of general equity fund.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P 500 index funds tend to hold liquid, large growth stocks,
which have turned in relatively weak performances as investors have
become more confident that the bull market will continue. That
confidence has prompted them to invest in beaten-down value stocks
and riskier small-cap issues.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, ``people have been afraid not to be in
the market,'' explained A. Michael Lipper, chairman of Lipper. But
because of worries about the economy and the markets, he said, they
stuck to highly liquid, big-name growth stocks, which can thrive in
poor economic environments. Now, he said, ``people seem to think
this is going to last and not roll over.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not necessarily good news: investors often gain
confidence ahead of a selloff, Lipper said, as they did in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The best-performing type of general equity funds was micro-cap,
which returned 15.38 percent, followed by small-cap, 10.51 percent,
and mid-cap, 8.23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Growth-and-income funds returned 5.46 percent, equity-income
funds averaged 6.38 percent. Growth funds, the biggest fund
category type with $827.3 billion in assets, returned 2.81 percent
and aggressive capital appreciation funds returned 4.42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 25 biggest United States funds, Europacific Growth
was in first place, with a return of 8.07 percent, followed by an
American Funds sibling, Growth Fund of America, 7.54 percent, and
Fidelity Equity-Income, 6.83 percent. The big fund that lost the
most money for the quarter was Janus 20, chock-full of large-cap
growth stocks, which was down 7.79 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest fund, Fidelity Magellan, with $91.4 billion in
assets, returned 1.30 percent, while the second-largest, Vanguard
500 Index, with $86.7 billion in assets, returned 2.54 percent.

 (Attn: Fla., Ill., N.C., Mo.)  
 INVESTING WITH: GREGORY M. DePRINCE AND DAVID E. TIERNEY HARBOR (ART ADV: Graphic of Harbor Value Fund is being sent to NYT graphic
clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling
(888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27)  
 (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gregory M. DePrince, a portfolio manager at DePrince, Race &AMP;
Zolo in Orlando, Fla., says he barely knows David E. Tierney, a
managing partner at Richards &AMP; Tierney in Chicago. That is not
surprising _ until you consider that the two men jointly manage the
$185.5 million Harbor Value fund.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Tierney says he isn't even familiar with the stocks
picked by DePrince, who in turn describes their relationship this
way: ``I've met him, but I'm completely unaware of what he's
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   An odd relationship, to be sure, but a rewarding one. Harbor
Value returned 21.8 percent, annualized, for the three years ended
June 18, compared with 15.5 percent for its peer group of mid-cap
value funds, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial
publisher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index returned 28.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fund's structure is somewhat unusual, but it's worked
quite well,'' said Emily Hall, a Morningstar analyst. It's also
unusual that Harbor Capital Advisors, the fund's manager, is owned
by the packaging giant Owens-Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   How does the arrangement work? To fill the 70 percent of the
fund he runs, DePrince scours the markets for values among mid- and
large-capitalization companies _ but more on that shortly.
</P>
<P>
   As for the remainder of the fund, Tierney receives a quarterly
list of about 500 stocks from which DePrince plans to select his
part of the portfolio. Because Tierney knows the sector weightings
and other attributes of that universe, he can use a computer to
pick 150 stocks that _ when combined with DePrince's universe _ are
meant to match the Russell 3000 value index in terms of attributes
like price-to-earnings, dividend yield, sector weightings and
volatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the risk controllers,'' he said, because of the
diversification and balance he brings to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   DePrince's job, meanwhile, is to pick stocks that will
distinguish the fund from any index. It's a three-part process.
First, he screens 6,000 publicly traded securities for those with
above-average yields, market capitalizations of at least $1
billion, and sufficient liquidity. That gives him the diverse list
of stocks that is passed on to Tierney.
</P>
<P>
   Second, DePrince whittles down that list to 200 or so by looking
for issues that are undervalued both historically and relative to
the index. He uses four proxies for value: price-to-earnings and
price-to-book ratios, price-to-cash flow and a stock's yield
relative to the S&AMP;P 500 over time.
</P>
<P>
   Then he and two analysts make the final cut, to 75 stocks, by
looking for a catalyst that will cause investors to put a higher
valuation on the stock. Catalysts may include the start of a new
product cycle, a change in the pricing cycle of a company's
business or a restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   He now sees the most value incyclical stocks, especially paper,
chemicals, metals and machinery companies. ``After a three-year run
on growth stocks, these areas have become very undervalued,'' he
said. ``And on the fundamental side, we have the bottoming of the
Asian economies, the continuing strength in the U.S. economy and
relatively stable conditions in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   A favorite is Boise Cascade, the paper company. The stock yields
1.41 percent, and DePrince says it has a price-to-book ratio of
1.8, in the bottom third of all stocks. The catalyst for
improvement, he said, is rising demand for two key products _
uncoated freesheet and liner board, which should result in higher
prices.
</P>
<P>
   He first bought shares in July 1998, at $29.25, and has a
12-month price target of $48. The stock now trades at $42.625, or
28.7 times analysts' 1999 earnings estimates of $1.49 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Also last July, he bought shares of Emerson Electric, the
electrical equipment maker. Emerson, which yields 2.02 percent,
acquired Westinghouse Process Controls in the third quarter of last
year. ``We like the acquisition, because it gives Emerson the
opportunity to cross-sell all their other electrical equipment
products'' to Westinghouse's customer base, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson's recently announced acquisition of Daniel Industries,
which makes measurement control devices for the oil and gas
industry, will provide a similar opportunity, he added.
</P>
<P>
   DePrince has a 12-month price target of $89 on the stock, which
now trades at $64.4375, or 21.49 times the earnings of $3 a share
that analysts estimate for 1999. Its price-to-book multiple is 4.7.
</P>
<P>
   In September, he acquired shares in Bank of America of
Charlotte, N.C., which yields 2.56 percent. ``The Nationsbank
acquisition of BankAmerica provides enormous cost-cutting
opportunities, on top of the successful integration with Barnett
Banks in Florida and Boatmen's Bancshares in Missouri,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His 12-month price target is $86; the stock now trades at
$70.375, or 2.6 times book value and 14.89 times analysts' 1999
earnings estimates of $4.73 a share.

IN NEW YORK, A WHOLE LOT OF TALKING'S GOING ON

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With Old World rivals like Paris and Berlin and New
World rivals like Seattle and Silicon Valley, New York City can
hardly claim to be the brain capital of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But you wouldn't necessarily know that from all the talking
going on. Call them seminars or lectures or discussions, but the
city is truly brimming with forums for the thinking man, woman and
child. In any given week an intrepid ideas-seeker can find serious
discussions about everything from the growing presence of Islam in
America to the social history of popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   Want to know how to cross-hybridize corn? There are talks at the
Brooklyn Botanic Garden. How about an in-depth look at democracy in
Cuba? Check out the Brecht Forum on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of Barnes &AMP; Noble and other supersize bookstores,
literary discussion groups are meeting regularly to chat about
Vietnam novels and science fiction and New Age tomes. Then there
are the literary fan clubs, societies devoted to the work of late
great authors like Yeats and Dickens.
</P>
<P>
   Last week alone a New Yorker could find dozens of people sitting
down to learn about Surrealist film, beach erosion and the history
of marriage from a feminist perspective. There were appearances by
seminar stars like Stephen Jay Gould, the historian, who can pack a
room on a topic like ``The Impossibility of Historical
Prediction,'' and celebrity lecturers like Philip Glass, the
composer whose talent for artful digression rivals that of many
more experienced speakers.
</P>
<P>
   All of this tossing about of ideas gives rise to a curious
question: Could one, by visiting many of these lectures and
listening closely enough, pick up some sense of the city's
intellectual zeitgeist?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is no. To be sure, there is plenty of
millennial reflection going on right now, and more than a few
speakers tossing around words like ``calendric'' and ``fin de
siecle.''
</P>
<P>
   But rather than indicating a common theme, this profusion of
talkers and listeners testifies instead to the city's enormously
varied intellectual appetite. It also shows off the city as a place
where people with specific interests _ sometimes, exceedingly
specific _ can find like-minded folk to commune with.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is an account of a weeklong survey of the city's
educated chatter.
</P>
<P>
   The first stop, as any lecture junkie will tell you, was bound
to be a big-time bookstore. Hoping to lure buyers into the stacks,
chains like Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders Books have been aggressive
about scheduling authors with new books to discuss and read from
their work.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the choices included a speaker on the history of
coffee at Barnes &AMP; Noble on the Upper East Side and a discussion of
the work of Bernhard Schlink at the Barnes &AMP; Noble in Forest Hills,
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   No. And no. Instead, my choice was a lecture by Paul Levinson, a
professor of communications history and philosophy at Fordham
University, whose most recent book is ``Digital McLuhan,'' a look
at the lasting influence of Marshall McLuhan in the age of the
Internet. The locale was a Borders at the World Trade Center, with
an audience of about 40, including a man who slept before, during
and after the event.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson, flanked by stacks of photography books and others
merely labeled ``Art,'' expounded on likenesses between the
futuristic visions of McLuhan, who invented the term Global
Village, and today's World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``McLuhan was not able to write on the Web, but his approach was
Weblike,'' Levinson said, citing McLuhan's propensity for short
chapters and nonlinear thought in his books. The comments drew a
round of emphatic nods.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would Marshall McLuhan have said about the Internet and
the Web?'' Levinson said. ``It's impossible to say.'' He paused and
added with a laugh: ``Except that he would have had a lot to say
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's schedule was to begin early, with a 7:30 a.m. talk
with the television commentator Cokie Roberts at the 92nd Street Y.
But upon arriving, I discovered a sacred rule of the intellectual
set: They like to sleep late. The event had been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The 92nd Street Y is one of the city's premier temples of talk,
a list that includes the New York Public Library, the Asia Society
and the Pierpont Morgan Library, which has a series of afternoon
discussions. And while summer may be a slow time for the city's
colleges and universities, they generally offer countless lectures
that are open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Many churches and museums also offer issue-oriented events. Ms.
Roberts, in fact, would make an appearance at Trinity Church later
that afternoon, speaking on religion and politics.
</P>
<P>
   For true intellectual heft, however, perhaps few spots can rival
the Brecht Forum, where Gould spoke on Tuesday night. The first
words I heard upon entering were ``imperialist dialectic
interpretation of history.''
</P>
<P>
   The forum is on the 10th floor of 122 W. 27th St. in Manhattan,
a loft space where papier mache wall hangings and pamphlets jockey
for visitors' attention.
</P>
<P>
   Gould had drawn a standing-room-only crowd dotted with older men
with ponytails, older women with spectacles and graduate student
types scribbling notes on legal pads. The amiable Gould, with a
pair of glasses hung around his neck, hit upon Karl Marx's funeral
(``Only nine people were there''), the year 2000 (``a wonderfully
arbitrary transition'') and Yogi Berra's wisdom (``The future ain't
what it used to be'') before finally alighting on his thesis: that
people, especially scientists, are terrible at predicting the
future.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Gould told the story of an early chairman of
Mercedes-Benz who once predicted that Europe would never sustain
more than a million cars. The reason? That the Continent's
citizenry could only ever produce a million chauffeurs.
</P>
<P>
   Gould's point was that the underlying biases of class, race and
economics often skewed any possibility of prognostication.
``Scientific biases prevent accurate prediction,'' he said. ``And
always have.''
</P>
<P>
   There was much scribbling as I left.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The next stop was the Kitchen, the venerable experimental
theater space on West 19th Street, the site of a batch of
summertime lectures by members of the Kitchen's artistic family.
</P>
<P>
   The seats were nearly all filled with a younger crowd than that
at the Brecht Forum. The lights dimmed theatrically as Glass
approached a small table draped in black and lighted by a single
overhead spotlight. He immediately said that his lecture, titled
``Collaboration and the New Technology,'' presented a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made up the title months ago,'' Glass said. ``Now, I've had
to figure out what it was about.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a voice barely above a burble, Glass touched on the
miraculous technology of the piano (see lecture title), and his
artistic collaborations (see lecture title) with everyone from
Jerome Robbins to Martin Scorsese. But the most absorbing moments
came when Glass' focus strayed a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``CD-ROM is already on the way out,'' he said at one point,
seeming alarmed and amused all at once. ``Did you know that?''
</P>
<P>
   Or: ``I've noticed my cat doesn't watch television. Does
yours?''
</P>
<P>
   Or: ``The only place the composer is the boss is in the opera
house. That's why I write so many operas.''
</P>
<P>
   At evening's end a young composer asked Glass' advice about the
profession. Glass puzzled for a bit and finally answered: ``Think
what you could do that would make your teachers really angry. That
would probably be the most interesting thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The following night I tried a couple of the city's newer venues,
the two-year-old Newseum and Joe's Pub, the recently opened cabaret
spot at the Public Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The Newseum auditorium is a sleek Madison Avenue lecture hall
popular with that famously loquacious breed, the journalist.
Booking reporters as speakers has its drawbacks, of course; a talk
on Monday by the photojournalist Harry Benson was canceled when he
was called away on assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Thomas, veteran White House correspondent and recent
author of a memoir, spoke about her experiences. Beltway
reminiscences ensued: of Lyndon B. Johnson, who ``couldn't stand
anybody speaking for him''; Hillary Clinton, who ``just hates the
press''; and President Clinton, who ``has been very nice to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, unswayed by Ms. Thomas' assertion that reporters
shouldn't be celebrities, ate it up.
</P>
<P>
   Joe's Pub, which usually presents music, turned literary
Wednesday with a selection of readings from The New Yorker's latest
fiction issue. Special attractions included celebrity readers,
girls in slinky dresses looking to impress New Yorker editors and
lots of cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   The final evening of talk, Thursday, highlights what may be the
seminar scene's most important contribution to the city's
intellectual landscape: bringing together people with particular
interests. At the Lesbian and Gay Community Center in the West
Village, for example, E.J. Graff, a writer, discussed same-sex
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Then at Borders Books at East 57th Street and Park Avenue, four
African-American authors gathered to discuss the topic of ``The
Importance of Writing About Contemporary Black Life.'' The audience
was almost exclusively black, a marked change from most of the
other events I attended. One at a time, each author discussed
pressing issues for black artists, including stereotyping by
publishers and the complications of success for blacks in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started writing because I wanted to write about where we are
now,'' said Benilde Little, a novelist. ``We are the most educated,
most affluent, and probably the most confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Events like this, she said, offer an opportunity to reflect on
those confusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a community where we can be ourselves,'' Ms.
Little said, ``drop the masks and let our hair down.''

A CONSISTENT EXCEPTION TO THE RULE

Survey is being sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27)  
 (af)  
 By MARK HULBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fischer Black, the late economist, made a remarkable statement
in 1971. Black was a father of the efficient-markets hypothesis,
which holds that no adviser or system can beat the market
consistently. But after analyzing the track record of the Value
Line Investment Survey, he conceded that it was a big exception.
</P>
<P>
   He concluded that almost all Wall Street firms ``would improve
their performance if they fired all but one of their security
analysts and then provided the remaining analyst with the Value
Line service.''
</P>
<P>
   I am not aware of any brokerage firm that ever took such action,
and Black later went to Wall Street himself, eventually becoming a
partner at Goldman, Sachs. But considering even the more recent
performance of the Value Line survey, which began its stock ranking
system in 1965, his observation may still be on target: Studies
have shown that the vast majority of firms have failed to match the
market with their advice.
</P>
<P>
   And the Value Line Investment Survey is one of very few
investment newsletters to have beaten the stock market since
mid-1980, when The Hulbert Financial Digest began monitoring the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   A portfolio of Value Line's top-ranked stocks has gained 18.2
percent, annualized, through April 30, versus 17.0 percent for the
Wilshire 5000, the broad market index.
</P>
<P>
   (Value Line is in second place in the digest's newsletter
performance rankings over that period, after The Prudent
Speculator, which returned 18.6 percent a year, on average. But
Value Line is in first place after performance is adjusted for
risk.)
</P>
<P>
   Value Line's system is proprietary, so we don't know its exact
methodology. But we do know that Value Line favors stocks, of
various market capitalizations, whose prices and earnings per share
are rising fastest. Each week, it ranks a universe of 1,700 stocks,
primarily from the New York Stock Exchange. The top 100, which
Value Line calls its Group 1, are those that it recommends most
highly.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of Group 1 has been relatively consistent,
regardless of the investment style in fashion on Wall Street. In
that respect, the Value Line system stands in sharp contrast with
many others, which shine when their chosen styles are in vogue but
otherwise may barely keep their heads above water.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Value Line's top-ranked stocks perform best when
small-cap stocks dominate the stock market, and when growth stocks
outperform value. But, surprisingly, they perform creditably even
when the opposites are true.
</P>
<P>
   During the years since 1980 in which growth stocks have
outperformed value, Group 1 produced an average annualized return
of 22 percent. In the years when value stocks have led the market,
the system still gained 12.5 percent, annualized.
</P>
<P>
   A similar pattern emerges when performance is judged by market
capitalization. Value Line returned 26.0 percent, annualized,
during years when small-cap stocks dominated, and 12.1 percent when
large caps performed best.
</P>
<P>
   If you're thinking of following Value Line's advice, however, it
would be best to do so in a tax-deferred account. Acting on its
ratings changes would lead to an annual portfolio turnover rate of
around 200 percent, thus creating a big potential capital-gains
liability.
</P>
<P>
   If you do want to follow Value Line in a taxable account, you
might want to ignore the week-to-week updates in the rankings and
update your portfolio less often. You could buy a set of Group 1
stocks each Jan. 1, for example, and hold them for the entire year
_ even those that are dropped from Group 1 along the way. Though
your pretax returns will likely be lower, my research indicates
that your after-tax returns will most likely be greater.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, your options are limited if you want to follow
the Value Line ranking system through mutual funds. Value Line's
no-load mutual funds adhere only loosely to the Value Line ranking
system and, on the whole, have underperformed it. &QL;

TITLE CONCEPT FUELED BY ALMIGHTLY DOLLAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID THOMAS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let me get this straight.
</P>
<P>
   Texas can't even determine ``one'' high school state football
champion in its four largest classifications. Now someone thinks we
can determine a ``national'' champion?
</P>
<P>
   Or i$ it really that $omeone think$ there i$ money to be made
here?
</P>
<P>
   I smell a rat. Or maybe it's a Fox, as in Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   Fox plans the first high school football national championship
game for December 2000. As it stands now, University
Interscholastic League rules would not allow a Texas school to play
in that game.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, UIL.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's hope the UIL _ which actually is a from-the-bottom-up
organization that enforces what its member schools tell it to _ can
take that line in the sand and make it a line set in stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thou shalt not play for a national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   High school football is moving quickly toward the same level as
college football. Not only in the level of competition but also in
the competition for its athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The media attention. The recruiting experts. The shoe contracts.
The advertising dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Texas high school football sells.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the current issue of ``Texas Football'' magazine, that
red-breasted robin of Texas high school football.
</P>
<P>
   This is edition No. 40. ``Texas Football'' is successful because
advertisers support it. Advertisers support it because we buy it.
</P>
<P>
   (By the way, did anyone else find curious the Rawlings
advertisement for its Lone Star All-Star Team that stated, ``You
kicked  &LR; ! And we took names.'' Another line crossed for high school
sports?)
</P>
<P>
   That you're reading this page most likely means that you want to
read about high school sports. And football is the biggie.
</P>
<P>
   If any sport can support a national high school championship,
it's football.
</P>
<P>
   But should it? No.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious reason is that a national poll will determine
the nation's top two teams, which would meet for the national
title. College football's poll system doesn't work, so how can a
national high school poll be expected to work?
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the lesser reasons, such as the potential for a
state champion to end its season with a loss, scheduling problems
and funding.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger reason is that we don't need a national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   There's a two-question litmus test we can take to prove that.
</P>
<P>
   Question 1: If five years down the road, it's determined that
for five consecutive years the national championship game has not
crowned a ``true'' national champion, will the game be dropped?
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   Question 2: If five years down the road, it's determined that
for five consecutive years the national championship game has lost
money, will the game be dropped?
</P>
<P>
   Yes.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is the bottom line. The national championship
game is not about making a national champion, it's about making
money.
</P>
<P>
   And it is there that this concept crosses the line. nn

COLLEGE CONTROVERSIES SHOULD HAVE TAUGHT US
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's talk controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Let's talk college football's national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Has there been a subject in sports over the years that can touch
the annual brouhaha surrounding the crowning of a college football
national champion? Three times in the 1990s, the two major polls
have failed to agree on a winner. As recently as 1997, voters
couldn't decide between Michigan and Nebraska. And even when the
polls do agree, there are always a ton of contenders right behind
clamoring that they were robbed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's cut to the real issue here. Fox Sports Net has
floated the idea of a high school championship game, beginning in
2000, with the top two teams from Doug Huff's national poll duking
it out for the right to call themselves No. 1 in America.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with this picture?
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, we can't come up with a definitive champion out of
112 Division I-A colleges, more than half of which most of the
voters have seen in person or on television. So now we're to try to
get one out of the nation's 17,346 high schools, which is the
latest membership figure from the National Federation of State High
School Associations. And how many of them do you figure Huff has
seen?
</P>
<P>
   The notion that Fox or Huff or anyone else can even come close
to determining a national high school football champion is, in a
word, absurd. We can't even come up with a state champion in Texas
for crying out loud. Last year, the University Interscholastic
League crowned 10 _ count 'em, 10 _ state champions, and that
doesn't even count all the private-school organizations.
</P>
<P>
   You tell me: Was Midland Lee better than Duncanville? Were
either better than Stephenville? How about Aledo? Now extend that
nationally and try to sort through that mess.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, pick two teams to play in the game. I'll find 20 more
with legitimate claims. The poll will be skewed toward the largest
classifications in the traditional best football states, which is
to be expected. But an undefeated state champ from, say, Idaho
could well be better than undefeated state champs from Florida and
California. Class 4A Stephenville might be able to defeat any 5A
team. If Fox's proposed Impossi-Bowl becomes a reality, you will
still never know.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox idea is a fraud, every bit as mythical as Huff's current
national champ and far worse than the No. 1 vs. No. 2 bowl games
foisted upon us every year by the preposterous Bowl Championship
Series. Anything that can be done to make it go away _ including
the UIL's current stance prohibiting its members from playing in it
_ is welcome. If it is eventually played, it will be nothing more
than a get-rich quick scheme based on smoke and mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   We already have more than enough of those in sports. For a quick
count, start with the number of bowl games sanctioned by the NCAA.
Does anyone even know who played in last season's Humanitarian
Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   Let's not add one more to the list. nn

 (af)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ It was past 10 p.m., and the Frankfurt
Galaxy was being pummeled by the visiting Scottish Claymores.
Despite the late hour and poor prospects, the home crowd of 30,000
noisy fans still packed a stadium throbbing with rock music.
</P>
<P>
   When Frankfurt scored a late touchdown _ still not enough to win
_ the crowd lapsed into the only German song of the night: ``Oh,
wie ist das schoen!'' (roughly, ``How sweet it is!''). When the
game ended, fireworks lit up the sky.
</P>
<P>
   For Oliver Luck, president of the National Football League of
Europe, it was an affirmation of a strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see what I mean?'' Luck shouted ebulliently over the
noise. ``This crowd has been sitting here for three hours, but for
them it seemed like 20 minutes!''
</P>
<P>
   And that is the name of the game. As maestro of the NFL's
improbable effort to export American football to Europe, Luck
decided long ago that he was selling more than a sport. After all,
football is a game that few Europeans have ever played and that
most find bewildering, with players who have unfamiliar names and
do not speak the local language.
</P>
<P>
   So Luck, 39, markets his sport as entertainment, with loud
music, long-legged cheerleaders (an alien concept at the soccer
games Europeans follow avidly), a four-hour pregame ``power party''
and stunts worthy of P.T. Barnum.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Luck pretended to fall out of a helicopter onto
the field _ a double actually made the leap as Luck's image flashed
on the giant scoreboard. Luck then popped out, grinning, from a
gaggle of cheerleaders.
</P>
<P>
   At the NFL Europe's World Bowl championship Sunday _ the Galaxy
versus the Barcelona Dragons in Dusseldorf _ the game ball will be
delivered by a jet-propelled ``rocket man'' who will fly in over
the stadium wall. Four squads of cheerleaders will be on hand.
Halftime festivities will include a fashion show.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a long game, three hours,'' Luck said. ``The last
thing we want to do is to bore people.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketing American football in Europe is about as strange as
teaching cricket in Texas, and after nine years the NFL and Luck
are still struggling to secure a foothold on a continent ruled by
soccer. Some teams draw well _ Frankfurt and Dusseldorf routinely
pack their stadiums at ticket prices as high as $35.
</P>
<P>
   But Edinburgh, Amsterdam and Barcelona continue to lose money,
and the London Monarchs ran into so much trouble that Luck shut
down the team last year, replacing it with a team in Berlin this
spring. (The league has six teams and plays a 10-week schedule,
from mid-April to mid-June.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obstacles, overall attendance and advertising
revenue are climbing, and the league now brings in about $30
million a year. Just as important to the NFL parent organization,
the European league seems to be stimulating new interest in the
game itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to bring the game close to fans in Europe, to give
them a magnet that will attract them more to the game,'' Paul
Tagliabue, commissioner of the National Football League, said while
on a visit to see the Berlin team earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to find someone better suited to selling
football in Europe than Luck. He knows the game intimately, having
played for the Houston Oilers from 1982 to 1986 as the backup
quarterback to Warren Moon. He also speaks fluent German and is a
sports commentator on German television.
</P>
<P>
   While with the Oilers, he studied law in the off-season. Later,
he ran unsuccessfully for Congress in West Virginia, where he was
well known from his days as a player for the University of West
Virginia Mountaineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a candidate for Congress turned out to be good
preparation for this job,'' he mused recently. ``In the campaign I
worked nonstop to get people to vote for me. But it's a lot like
selling tickets _ a lot of personal contact, and you never say
goodbye to anyone without trying to close a sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Luck arrived here in 1990, to start and manage the Frankfurt
Galaxy of the World Football League, an NFL-backed venture with
teams in both North America and Europe that lasted just two years.
After it was disbanded in 1992, Luck worked on plans for the
current, Europe-only successor league, which started in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Germans took to American football fairly readily, partly because
the American military presence here since World War II had given
them some familiarity with it. But a promising start in London
turned to disaster when British fans, intrigued by the original
World League, were soured by its shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we left, we really produced a lot of negative reaction,
and we never recovered,'' Tagliabue said. ``They had had their own
team, and they saw it as part of an international league that was
playing teams in the United States. It was a really big thing. And
we pulled the rug out from under them.''
</P>
<P>
   The coaches of all six NFL Europe teams are from the United
States, and most of the players are Americans on contract to NFL
teams at home or free agents hoping to be spotted by scouts, making
the Europe league something of a training ground for the parent
league.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a key problem has been to keep the game from being so
dominated by Americans that Europeans lose interest. To that end,
league rules require a minimum number of local players on each
roster and at least two locals on the field every second play.
</P>
<P>
   Luck has also recruited retired soccer stars as punters and
place-kickers. But their presence hasn't solved the image problem,
since virtually all the quarterbacks and most other high-profile
players are American. And Luck frets that featuring retired soccer
stars may make people think his game is for old people.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he has introduced some crowd-pleasing ideas, like the
rock music, the cheerleaders (who sometimes get more attention than
the teams in the tabloid papers) and, especially, beer. Beer is
banned at most soccer games in Europe because officials are
concerned about hooliganism in the crowds. But Luck won permission
to sell it freely at NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, at least, the hoopla has attracted serious
commercial sponsors, including Ericsson, the Swedish mobile
telephone manufacturer, and Skoda, the Czech subsidiary of
Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``American football is targeted to a very unique young customer
segment,'' said Frank Farsky, Skoda's head of communications in
Prague. ``Football is a show. It's always been about cheerleaders
and music and Americana.''
</P>
<P>
   But what works in one country may not work in another. Most of
the league's games are scheduled for Saturday nights, perfect for
football in Germany because retail stores here close by 4 p.m. But
Saturday night is prime shopping time in Barcelona. League
officials thought about moving Barcelona's Saturday home games to
Fridays but settled on adapting to Spain's tradition of late-night
socializing by shifting the ``power party'' to after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more like a warm-up to Barcelona night life,'' said Willy
DeWitt, the Barcelona team's acting general manager, who is Dutch.

MBEKI SETS PRIORITIES: PRIVATIZATION, CRIME, LABOR LAWS AND SOCIAL
ISSUES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Switzerland)   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ South Africa's new president, Thabo
Mbeki, signaled Friday that he had his own way of doing things as
he opened parliament with a speech outlining dozens of new
initiatives from privatization efforts to tough new laws against
racketeering, money laundering and illegal weapons.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Far from the inspirational talk about reconstruction and
reconciliation that had often characterized former President Nelson
Mandela's speeches, Mbeki's hourlong address was more a list of the
work his administration was engaged in.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki offered the nation a detailed look at his priorities,
which included establishing centers for abused women and children;
stepping up efforts to combat AIDS and creating a long-awaited
state lottery.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki was often short on specifics, but there was hardly an
issue facing this troubled nation that he did not discuss. He even
named neighborhoods with the worst crime rates, saying they would
soon have pilot programs to test new policing methods.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While he continued to endorse the country's conservative
economic policies, he also seemed to suggest that he would take a
look at new labor laws that might give the impression that South
Africa was not a good place for foreign investment.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``At the dawn of a new life, our practical actions must ensure
that none can challenge us when we say we are a nation at work to
build a new life,'' Mbeki said &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He made clear that bringing down South Africa's soaring crime
rate _ an issue that had dominated the campaign trail _ was a
priority.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the central features of the brutish society we seek to
bring to an end,'' Mbeki said, ``is the impermissible level of
crime and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The police force that was left over from the apartheid era was
one of the least educated in the world, trained mainly for riot
control. Convictions were often obtained on the strength of
confessions extracted by violence. About one third of the officers
are illiterate and can't drive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Mbeki revealed plans to recruit new officers ``with the
requisite education'' and to put them on the fast track to
management.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He also announced that a new unit _ ``adequately staffed and
equipped'' to deal with ``national priority crimes'' including
corruption among officers would be created within 14 days. He
promised that new legislation making it easier to crack down on
organized crime and money laundering would be introduced.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, other legislation to ``ensure that we can
deal mercilessly with all crimes involving guns, including the
illegal possession of fireams, the killing of police officers,
corruption within the criminal justice system and the intimidation
of witnesses,'' would also be introduced.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki, whose African National Congress party won nearly
two-thirds of the 400 seats in the National Assembly in the June 2
elections, also vowed to tackle corruption in national and local
government. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to take this opportunity once more to reiterate
the commitment of our government to honest, transparent and
accountable government and our determination to act against anybody
who transgresses these norms,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Mbeki's new government is already embroiled in controversy
on this issue. This week a provincial leader appointed by Mbeki,
Ndaweni Mahlangu, said that he did not see anything wrong with
politicians lying, ``It was done all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahlangu has re-appointed several officials who are under
investigation for lying or have been found ``unfit'' for government
by reviewing authorities. Mahlangu eventually apologized for his
remarks saying they were inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics had hoped Mbeki would use the occasion of his
speech to say something about the incident. He did not.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Economic issues were also clearly high on Mbeki's list of
priorities. Mandela's administration had been criticized for moving
slowly to privatize the South African government's extensive
assets.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Mbeki took the opportunity to announce that Swissair would
buy a 20 percent stake in South African Airways for more than $200
million, and he promised that more such deals were in the offing.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said working groups would be looking at the development of
small businesses and, noting that interest rates remain high, he
said the Reserve Bank and the finance ministry would continue to
look at this issue very carefully. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the markets reacted well to the speech, although
the all-share index fell after a bout of profit-taking ahead of the
weekend and fears of interest rate increases in the United States.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki also said that South Africa intended to take an active
interest in trying to resolve regional conflicts and that Mandela
might be called on for such work.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot accept that war and violent conflict are a permanent
condition of existence for us as Africans,'' he said. Therefore, he
added, ``we will contribute whatever we can towards the resolution
of conflicts on our continent.''

 &HT;    Bush rakes in $2 million during Florida swing
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ Hail hit the private jet and the aircraft bounced
violently for a few moments but those were the only minutes of
discomfort Friday for Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who scooped up $2
million in a one-day, four-city campaign trip to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   During the flight, Bush, who has been criticized by his GOP
rivals for not being specific enough about issues, said that the
purpose of this first stage of his campaign is to let people get to
know him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking a lot about policy every time I get asked
questions,'' said the 52-year old brother of Gov. Jeb Bush. ``We
have a long way to go in this campaign and unlike the others I've
been home in Texas doing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who delayed campaigning outside of Texas until that
state's legislature ended it's session last month, said the first
thing he needs to do is let voters know ``what my goals are for
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting with his ``little brother'' in the comfortable cabin of
the large private jet, Bush said as recently as last Christmas he
was not sure he wanted to be a candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in the groundswell thing,'' said the oldest
son of former President George Bush who looks strikingly like his
75-year old father. ``A candidate has got to really want to run''
for a campaign to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   With the trappings of a campaign that has quickly raised $20
million, the large Bush entourage looked and acted very much like a
campaign that has already won the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the level of expectation for his candidacy, Bush
acknowledged that it is ``out of sight.'' Comparing his campaign to
a start-up business, he said it has gone from a ``small
entrepreneurial start to the Forbes 500 almost immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on his father's 1992 loss to President Clinton, Bush
said he remembered when his father started the year with a 92
percent approval rating and dropped to the low 30s 11 months later.
``I know what it's like to go from high to low. I know every
painful moment of that,'' he said. ``I've to make sure that doesn't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush began his trip with at the Fort Myers home of Al Hoffman
where he collected $800,000 at a $1,000 per person breakfast,
according to campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughs. Hoffman is chairman
of Watermark Communities Inc., which is developing large areas of
northern Palm Beach County and Martin County. Then it was lunch in
Tampa, a reception in Fort Lauderdale and dinner in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   At each of his stops, Bush talked to the crowds about his belief
in compassionate conservatism. He said part of the compassion is
making sure that the economy remains strong so that people can have
jobs. He also said that with prosperity comes responsibility and
that corporations must do more to help their workers lead
successful lives.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also talked in general terms about the need to improve
education, build a strong defense and to help those who ``are
participating fully in the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   With his brother as governor of Florida, Bush said he is
confident that he will win the state primary and the general
election if he becomes the GOP nominee. ``It helps to have friends
in high places,'' he said as his brother looked on during a news
conference in Tampa. ``For the first time in my life I'm doing what
my little brother tells me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked questions by Hispanic reporters, Bush answered in
Spanish but without the ease of his younger brother, who is fluent
in the language. As the older brother spoke, the younger stood
behind him smirking and mouthed a couple of word's when his brother
struggled.
</P>
<P>
   It was part of a daylong ribbing that the two brothers gave each
other at each stop often to the laughter of the crowds. At one
point Bush was asked if he would appoint his younger brother to the
Cabinet. With Jeb Bush shaking his head in an exaggerated ``No,''
his brother looked at the crowd and just said with a grin, ``Well,
no.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he expects the money he is raising _ far more than any
other Republican candidate _ to scare off his rivals, Bush said,
``I'm not sure what's on their mind. The only thing I know to do is
to campaign hard. I'm pleased with the fundraising response. I
think it is an indication of the support this campaign has across
the country.''

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, June 25 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: STEEL
</P>
<P>
   Voting 42-57, the Senate on Tuesday blocked debate on a measure
that would have imposed limits on steel imports into the United
States. The bill was a response to the foreign steel that has
flooded the U.S. market in the wake of the Asian financial crisis.
Supporters said it was necessary to discuss the bill because the
import limits were needed to protect the U.S. steel industry from
unfair trade practices. Opponents said the quotas would violate
international trade laws and cause other countries to retaliate
against U.S. exports. A ``yes'' vote favors continuing debate on
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: HEALTH
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday failed to pass an amendment that would
have added the Democrat's managed-care reform proposal to an
agriculture spending bill. Voting 53-47, the Senate tabled, or set
aside, the proposal. The failure of the amendment led to a halt in
further consideration of the agriculture bill because Democrats
threatened to keep offering parts of the proposal as amendments
until the issue is addressed. Opponents of tabling the measure said
it is time for the Senate to address legislation that could remedy
the problems faced by patients when dealing with their health care
providers. Supporters of tabling the measure said the Democrat's
plan does not adequately address those problems. A ``yes'' vote
favors tabling the measure.
</P>
<P>
   VOTE : 1 2
</P>
<P>
   --- ---
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: SAFETY
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, June 18, the House approved, 311-115, an amendment to
a larger gun legislation package that would have required handguns
be sold with child safety locks or storage devices. But the
amendment did not pass out of the House because the gun package was
defeated. Supporters said the measure would protect children from
accidental deaths and injuries by handguns. No members rose in
opposition. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: D.C.BAN
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, June 18, the House rejected, 175-250, an amendment to
a larger gun legislation package that would have repealed the
District of Columbia's law that prevents residents from owning
firearms. Supporters said D.C. residents deserve the same Second
Amendment rights as other Americans. Opponents said the gun ban is
important to the safety of D.C. residents and that Congress does
not have any business overriding their gun laws. A ``yes'' vote
favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: D.C.GUNS
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, June 18, the House approved, 213-208, an amendment to
a larger gun legislation package that would permit law-abiding
District of Columbia residents to keep a handgun at home and to
carry an unloaded weapon. But the amendment did not pass out of the
House because the gun legislation package was defeated. Supporters
of the amendment said D.C. residents should have the same rights as
other Americans and should be able to protect themselves if an
intruder invades their home. Opponents said Congress does not have
any business overriding D.C.'s gun laws. A ``yes'' vote favors the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: GUNS
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, June 18, the House rejected, 147-280, gun legislation
intended to limit the accessibility of guns to criminals and
children. The package included measures that would require 24-hour
background checks for purchases at guns shows, ban the import of
large-ammunition clips and require safety locks to be sold with
handguns. Supporters said the bill was an effective way to keep
firearms away from criminals and children without compromising the
rights of law-abiding gun owners. Democratic opponents said the
legislation was too watered-down and would actually weaken current
gun laws while conservative opponents said gun control was not the
answer to the recent episodes of violence. A ``yes'' vote favors
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: FLAG
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 305-124, an amendment to the
U.S. Constitution that would prohibit ``physical desecration'' of
the American flag. This is the third time that the House has
successfully garnered the two-thirds vote necessary to pass the
amendment. Now it goes to the Senate, where it has failed in the
past. Supporters said the flag is a national symbol that needs to
be protected. Opponents said flag desecration is a form of free
speech and therefore a guaranteed right under the First Amendment.
A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   6) BILL NUMBER: SEIZE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 375-48, a bill that will make it
harder for law enforcement officials to seize private property that
is suspected of being connected to crimes. Supporters said law
enforcement officials have abused their power in recent years to
seize property before criminal charges are filed. Opponents said
the measure goes too far, and would make it more difficult to fight
crime. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.

   I am pointing to the ever-darkening pictures in ``Goodnight
Moon,'' a book that has left its mark on three generations of
children. ``In the great, green room,'' I chant, hardly needing to
look at the text as I mention the red balloon, the cow, the bears,
the moon ...
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, sitting by a window through which a full moon
shines, my daughter, too young to talk, is struck by mental
lightning. Again and again she leaps from the book's pictures,
gesturing toward the night sky, making a connection that is as
profound as Helen Keller's identifying water with silent, fingered
symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Handler Spitz, a lecturer in the art department at
Stanford University, will perhaps forgive this memory's intrusion
on a review of her ``Inside Picture Books,'' because that sort of
personal involvement is just what she is exploring. She tells, for
example, of one elderly woman who has shunned chamomile tea all her
life because it was the seemingly punishing beverage Mother Rabbit
gave to mischievous Peter.
</P>
<P>
   Such indelibly intimate responses are the result of what Ms.
Spitz calls ``conversational reading.'' New forms of mental life
are created by children's picture books. The words are not silently
read but are spoken aloud. The pictures are not illustrations of
text but creators of meanings. The most central figure may not be
Madeline or the Cat in the Hat but the parent whose voice shapes
the child's first sense of the world and whose pointing finger
articulates its objects and images. The child is ``transported into
the realm of the uncanny'' by the parent: a source of fear and
comfort who enacts dramas in which fear and comfort are
intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   There is something fine and rare in Ms. Spitz's book, with its
interpretations of picture books ranging from Margaret Wise Brown's
``Goodnight Moon'' to Marjorie Flack's ``Story About Ping.''
Despite the references to Magritte and van Gogh, and analyses that
are influenced by Bettleheim, Freud and Piaget, Ms. Spitz speaks to
her readers not as an academic but as a practiced reader-aloud,
knowing the relationships that exist between a storyteller and
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   If, in the preface, she risks sentimentality in urging her
readers to ``enjoy your children'' and ``treasure the days of your
life that are spent in their company,'' that admonition is
suggestive of her compassionate and passionate readings.
</P>
<P>
   Not just any picture book will do. Ms. Spitz recalls, for
example, a recent clearance sale of such books as ``My Big Sister
Takes Drugs,'' ``I Wish Daddy Didn't Drink So Much,'' and ``Our
Teacher's in a Wheelchair.'' While acknowledging that these titles
may occasionally serve a purpose, she argues that they pale before
others, more resonant with metaphor and allusion; such classic
books strengthen children in ``their ongoing discovery of the
limitations of the real.'' A list of all-time best-selling
children's books that appeared in Publishers Weekly a few years ago
is almost the opposite of its adult counterpart: it is dominated by
classics of the genre.
</P>
<P>
   What allows such books to be so popular and so powerful?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spitz's use of the word ``uncanny'' is suggestive. Great
picture books seem to dwell on a border between worlds: between
childhood and adulthood, fantasy and realism, darkness and light.
They mark transitions, dramatize transformations, and reproduce the
tensions that lie latent between parent and listener.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spitz suggests that they also literally lead from day into
night, that a picture book's ``fundamental message will have to do
with its being the last human contact before sleep.'' In a sense,
she points out, every picture book is a bedtime story, not just
``Bedtime for Frances'' or ``Harold and the Purple Crayon'' or ``In
the Night Kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Spitz's fine interpretation of ``Goodnight Moon,'' her
themes converge. Nothing happens, but the coming of night, with the
child (a bunny) first surveying the great, green room and its
objects and then releasing them with the coming of sleep. As Ms.
Spitz shows, this is ``not a pastel book.'' It incorporates the
vaguely sinister: a tiger rug, a cat eyeing a mouse, the
encroaching darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Like other children's classics the book encompasses dangers
without nullifying them; they become part of the child's
experience. Every assurance is tinged with worry and every worry
tempered by assurance, much like the nature of the final farewell
of the parent upon finishing the book, leaving the child alone in a
dark room.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Ms. Spitz's analyses are overdone (the reading of ``In
the Night Kitchen'' is too Holocaust haunted), and some themes
might have been more systematically developed. On the issue of
gender she also tends to use too crude an interpretive grid. For
example: Are there really many more picture books about boys than
girls? Not in my experience and not in the list Ms. Spitz herself
provides as a bibliography.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Madeline,'' like other picture books, plays with gender
expectations _ Madeline is boyish, her post-appendicitis gifts are
girlish _ these gifts do not seem to be rewards ``for assuming her
designated gender role.'' Ms. Spitz often treats gender
differences, which are central to picture books, as if they were
arbitrarily ``designated'' by cultural history, even though she
otherwise spurns ``scholars who want to historicize everything.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Reading aloud, as Ms. Spitz argues, is an
extraordinary gift for children, unmatched by any promise of new
media. It is also a gift for the parent, who becomes practiced in
crossing childhood's boundaries while bearing full knowledge of
what is yet to come, not just in the books themselves but in the
unfolding lives of their listeners. One night, in fact, the
farewell comes from the other direction: the child passes through
those boundaries and turns away from the parent's reading voice,
ready to proceed into texts in solemn and silent solitude.

500 YEARS LATER, LEONARDO'S EQUINE DREAM IS REALIZED

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEACON, N.Y. _ Five hundred years ago, Leonardo da Vinci's
long-held plan to cast a 24-foot-tall bronze horse for his patron,
Duke Lodovico Sforza of Milan, crumbled when invading French troops
used the full-size clay model for crossbow practice.
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo never completed the piece, which would have been the
largest equestrian sculpture in the world, and some biographical
accounts have him crying on his deathbed over the unfulfilled
vision.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Leonardo's dream, first articulated as a
postage-stamp-size sketch, was revealed in three jaw-dropping
dimensions, in the form of a proudly prancing 15-ton bronze
stallion that was cast and assembled at a foundry here, 60 miles
north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation of the horse from dusty red sketches to
burnished bronze was the result of another man's dreams. In 1978,
Charles Dent, a United Airlines pilot, art collector and amateur
sculptor from Allentown, Pa., read about Leonardo's unfinished
project in an issue of National Geographic and began crafting a
preliminary clay model and raising money to cast the statue as a
gift for Milan.
</P>
<P>
   Dent died in 1994, but in his will he endowed a foundation to
see the project to its end. Now, $6 million and five years later,
the result towered over a crowd of several hundred visitors from as
near as around the block and as far away as Milan's City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an homage to the Renaissance,'' said Dent's nephew,
Peter Dent, who is a trustee of Leonardo Da Vinci's Horse Inc., the
private group created to build the horse. ``He loved Leonardo and
he loved that era.''
</P>
<P>
   The public showing here is the last step before the sculpture's
seven pieces are dismantled next week and flown in an Alitalia
jumbo jet to Milan, where the horse will be erected on a pedestal,
welded into a single piece, and unveiled on September 10, the 500th
anniversary of the day the French army occupied the Ducal palace
and disfigured Leonardo's prototype.
</P>
<P>
   While children, retirees and passing commuters snapped
photographs, inside the cavernous main building at the Tallix Inc.
foundry, which cast the sculpture, workers busily polished the weld
marks on pieces of the only other full-size casting, which is
scheduled to be shipped this fall to Grand Rapids, Mich., where it
will be displayed in a new sculpture park. The air held a mix of
the dank smell of clay and the tang from the wine-red wax that
burns away in the final step when the bronze is poured.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of other works in every conceivable style and in various
stages of completion crowded the five-story-tall room. A life-size
clay model of a nurse destined for the site of a former nursing
school in Hartford, Conn., stood near a 17-foot-tall clay model of
Antinous, a pleasure-loving figure in the court of Hadrian, which
will be cast in artificial marble and sent to the Peppermill Casino
in Reno, Nev., said its creator, Gail Demi Wilday, as she scraped a
bit of clay from the giant's toe.
</P>
<P>
   But everything in the foundry building was dwarfed by the clay
model that was the basis for the snorting bronze horse on the lawn
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilday, pausing in her work, said the power of the horse lay
in its history. ``It shows how the dream world can become a
reality,'' she said. ``When I stand under the head and look up, I
just want to cry, it's so overwhelmingly beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The open house at the foundry was scheduled to last all weekend,
with a Renaissance fair being staged by local merchants, who are
promoting this slowly reviving city as a haven for the arts.
Earlier this year, the Dia Center for the Arts announced that it
plans to turn an old printing factory at the other end of town into
a gallery that will be larger than the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   In the throng surrounding Leonardo's horse, which was ringed by
gold rope, reactions ranged from abstruse analysis by art
aficionados to spontaneous outbursts from children.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Akamu, the sculptor who built the 8-foot clay model that
was enlarged to make the giant final bronze, described the two
years of research that went into the final version. The main
resource was a trove of Leonardo's drawings that surfaced in Madrid
in 1965, but only a few of those were directly related to his plans
for the Milan horse, she said. One of the key drawings was one inch
across, and to get from that to a full-size sculpture required a
lot of artistic license, Ms. Akamu said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a re-creation of a Leonardo Da Vinci drawing,''
she said. ``It's a tribute, an homage, a synthesis.''
</P>
<P>
   Giangaleazzo Visconti di Modrone, a representative from the City
Council of Milan, shaded his eyes and stared up at the horse, which
is captured in mid trot, with one hind leg and one foreleg
suspended in the air, nostrils flared, eyes glaring.
</P>
<P>
   He said he recently viewed some of Leonardo's red-pencil
drawings in a Venice exhibition. ``It is very well made,'' he said
of the sculpture. ``It has the same strength, the same lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby stood a key patron of the project, Frederik Meijer, 79,
who owns a chain of warehouse-style retail stores and created the
public sculpture gardens in Grand Rapids that will be home to the
$2.4-million copy.
</P>
<P>
   He said the value of monumental works of art lay in their
permanence. ``I've got 121 stores and 80,000 employees, but our
gardens and this sculpture will outlast all of that. The horse will
be here 5,000 years from now. That's as eternal as you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Mona Scalzo, who grew up around the corner from the foundry and
now lives a few miles away in Fishkill, said the sculpture was
going to help elevate the reputation of Beacon. ``Beacon is similar
to New Jersey,'' she said. ``It doesn't get any respect. But now
everyone around the world will know us.''
</P>
<P>
   Three young girls from Poughkeepsie gawked at the horse while
their father took pictures. Jacqueline Slater, 11, said of
Leonardo: ``He's the one who painted `The Last Supper.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her little sister, Meghan, 7, quickly corrected her: ``No, that
was Leonardo de Caprio.''

CLINTON DEFENDS WIFE'S USE OF AIR FORCE PLANE IN SENATE CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Stands for budgeted CLINTON-CONGRESS.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, defending Hillary Rodham
Clinton's use of Air Force planes for travel to New York state as
she weighs a Senate campaign, said Friday that the Secret Service
requires her to fly on government planes.
</P>
<P>
   The president also gave a boost to his wife's senatorial
prospects, praising her efforts on domestic policy and dismissing
suggestions that his sexual dalliance with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky might handicap either her political
aspirations or the presidential campaign of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``All elections are about the future and all candidates are
judged on their own merits,'' Clinton said, adding: ``I think that
the American people know the country is in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Secret Service rule stems from the law
mandating that the Secret Service provide around-the-clock
protection to the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's aides say the first lady will start to partially
reimburse the Air Force for her travel after she forms an
exploratory committee in early July to raise campaign donations.
Regulations of the Federal Election Commission then will require
her campaign to reimburse the federal government a hypothetical
commercial airline fare for the itinerary rather than the actual
costs of operating the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   That fare is a small fraction of the actual cost of the
government plane. The Air Force estimates that the costs for the
executive jets that Mrs. Clinton has used for her New York trips
range from about $4,600 an hour to more than $7,200 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Clinton decides to run for the Senate, she would become
the first first lady in American history to seek a Senate seat
while living in the White House. The Senate seat is opening up
because of the retirement of Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The president and Mrs. Clinton are scheduled to travel aboard
Air Force One on Monday to Connecticut and New York City to attend
a series of political fund raisers designed to help underwrite
Democrats' efforts to retake control of the House and Senate from
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's confidantes say she is planning to move to New
York in the fall to devote full time to her expected Senate
campaign, returning to the White House on weekends, as her schedule
permits.
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a possible GOP rival for the
Senate seat, has questioned Mrs. Clinton's reliance on
taxpayer-subsidized Air Force planes and traveling White House
staff during the exploratory phase of her Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of how she travels is determined by the Secret Service,''
the president told a nationally televised news conference in which
he fielded 27 questions on foreign and domestic issues during 71
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he and his wife have often ``wanted to take trains
to New York'' during his presidency but the Secret Service has
insisted that the couple fly aboard the presidential aircraft known
as Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be amazed how many times in the last few years we've
wanted to take the train to New York, for example, and haven't been
able to do it,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton downplayed his wife's formal announcement of formation
of an exploratory committee. The announcement is expected on July
5, while the president is leading a group of corporate executives
around the nation to visit beleaguered communities that have not
benefited from the nation's overall prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hasn't made a decision to announce _ to run for the
Senate,'' Clinton emphasized. ``As a practical matter, she has to
have an exploratory committee to continue to talk to people in New
York about this. That's all this is.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his wife of 23 years ``has not made a final
decision to run yet'' for the Senate from New York, adding: `` So I
think that's a whole different issue, and I think that you should
look at it in that context.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, praising his wife's work, said he was heartened by
House passage of legislation to extend federally-subsidized care
for foster children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a vital issue, one that Hillary has championed for
many years, and I am very pleased by the House action,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also mentioned his wife's efforts and her book, ``It
Takes A Village,'' as he discussed White House steps to stem the
isolation of adolescents that some blame for the shootings in a
high school in Littleton, Colo., that claimed 15 lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Hillary and I decided that we ought to have this
grass-roots campaign to try to protect children against violence
... one of the things that we learned, obviously, is that a lot of
young people wind up being _ especially really troubled young
people can often be almost strangers in their own homes,'' Clinton
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he hoped his administration's efforts would help
``develop the kind of supports that parents need to do a better
job,'' adding: ``Of course, that's one of the reasons that Hillary
wrote her book a few years ago. And she knows more about that than
I do.''

<P>
   Clinton said despite the couple's decision to move to New York
after leaving the White House, he will continue to spend about half
of his time in his native Arkansas to help create his presidential
library and public policy think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have made it clear what I intend to do _ and what I intend
to do is to divide my time between Arkansas and New York,'' the
president said. Clinton said he would not be in Arkansas ``so much
I'll be underfoot'' but added: ``I'll be there quite a lot.''

STATES CHASING SALES TAXES DOWN THE INTERNET HIGHWAY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is one of the more vexing economic issues of the
Internet age: how to insure that state sales tax revenues are not
eviscerated by the shift to online retailing, where borders are all
but meaningless and sales tax collection is spotty at best.
</P>
<P>
   The question has riled both state and local governments, which
fear that their tax bases will disappear down a phone line at 56
kilobits a second, and electronic retailers and Internet service
providers, which fear that revenue-hungry governments will view
electronic commerce as a cash cow to be milked every which way.
</P>
<P>
   The basic problem has been around as long as mail-order
catalogs. When consumers order books, compact disks or flowers from
an out-of-state retailer, they are technically liable to pay sales
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Companies, however, are bound to collect the taxes only from
consumers in states where the company has a physical presence.
Although some merchants collect the tax even where they are not
required to do so, most do not.
</P>
<P>
   So for orders by mail, or phone _ or the Internet _ consumers
can end up with a tax-free purchase. That reality has left
traditional retailers complaining of a competitive disadvantage.
And it has left state and local governments worried that technology
is leaving tax policy far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Denied reliable sales taxes, they may have to look elsewhere for
revenue, with unpredictable consequences.
</P>
<P>
   It is not too hard to come up with potential solutions. But
don't look for them to be agreed upon and implemented quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Last week saw a flurry of attention to the issue, but no
consensus on anything. The Clinton administration issued a report
on the ``breathtaking'' growth of electronic commerce and the
technologies that make it possible, suggesting that the nation is
only starting to get a handle on all the ways the Internet is
changing the economy and necessitating adjustments to public
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest names in business weighed in with a report
about lost sales tax revenues that suggested the states have gotten
themselves in a lather about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   And the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce, established
last year by Congress to help sort out the taxation issue, held its
first meeting and quickly got into a heated debate about ... office
space.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's report, prepared by the Commerce
Department, acknowledged that the government was only starting to
collect and analyze information looking specifically at the
quantity and composition of electronic commerce. But while it cited
only vague estimates of the size of that business _between $7
billion and $15 billion last year, growing to as much as $80
billion in 2002 _ it included a set of examples that made clear how
powerful a force electronic commerce has become:
</P>
<P>
   _ The online sales of Dell Computer more than doubled last year,
and by next year the company expects them to account for half its
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   _ Quicken Mortgage, an online mortgage provider from Intuit,
arranged $400 million in loans in the first quarter of this year, a
pace far ahead of the $600 million in all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   _ US-Style.com recently started a service allowing Japanese
consumers to buy American goods through a Japanese-language Web
site. The report said the service highlighted the global nature of
electronic commerce and the potential for it to become a trade
issue.
</P>
<P>
   But what has all that activity meant for sales tax collections?
Not much, according to the study done by Ernst &AMP; Young for a
coalition that included America Online, Cisco Systems, Microsoft,
Time Warner and Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that state and local governments lost $170
million in sales tax revenue last year because of Internet
commerce, or 0.1 percent of total sales and use tax collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `revenue crisis' from Internet sales has not
materialized,'' it concluded. ``The Advisory Commission on
Electronic Commerce, state and local government and Congress have
time to carefully deliberate on the appropriate taxation of
E-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   That is good news for the commission, which spent a portion of
its first session last week debating whether its executive director
had created a conflict of interest in accepting free office space
from an electronics-industry lobbying group that employs her
husband. (Like any good commission, it opted to study the matter
further before making a decision.)
</P>
<P>
   There are technical and political hurdles to creating a system
that would automatically add the appropriate sales tax to Internet
purchases and funnel the revenue to the proper government. But none
of them are insurmountable; the electronic payment systems used by
the credit card companies and banks are the obvious model.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem is whether the commission, Congress and the
administration can work quickly enough to get ahead of the Internet
wave, or whether public policy is doomed always to paddle in its
wake. Given the libertarian ethos that has always pervaded
cyberspace, perhaps the latter is just the outcome that the
E-commerce industry and Internet users want.

A NEW BBC CHIEF, WITH TIES TO LABOR AND `BAYWATCH'
</HEADLINE>
  (jw)c 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British Broadcasting Corp., the august public
broadcaster that boasts of high-quality programs and neutral
politics, stirred passionate debate Friday by appointing as its new
head a millionaire Labor Party supporter associated with
``Baywatch'' and a puppet called Roland Rat.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination on Thursday of Greg Dyke, the head of Pearson
Television, as the BBC's next director general drew protests from
the Conservative opposition about the BBC's independence and
brought angry denunciations of what many call the ``dumbing down''
of programs.
</P>
<P>
   And it focused attentions anew on the $87,000 that Dyke has
donated in recent years to the political campaigns of Prime
Minister Tony Blair and his followers.
</P>
<P>
   In The Times of London _ owned by Rupert Murdoch, whose B Sky B
pay television competes fiercely with the BBC _ the headline on an
editorial read: ``Rotting at the Core: The Governors Have Scripted
a Tragedy for the BBC.''
</P>
<P>
   William Hague, the Conservative Party leader, said the
appointment by the BBC's board of governors, which is supposed to
be free of government control, smacked of ``cronyism.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Dyke, 52, told reporters that he resigned Friday
from the Labor Party and would leave his politics on the doorstep
when he started his new job in April. ``I have every confidence in
my ability to maintain the impartiality and the independence of the
BBC, which I feel enormously strongly about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate about his appointment is emotional here because many
Britons feel proprietorial about the BBC. They nickname it Auntie
for the staid image that emanates from the historical dramas,
political debates and solid news coverage that run alongside
British soaps, dramas and sports in its programming.
</P>
<P>
   They finance it through a compulsory $160-a-year license fee
that is supposed to cover many of the costs of domestic public
radio and television. And it is credited with wielding broad
political influence.
</P>
<P>
   Dyke, by contrast, is associated with such television coups as
rescuing the commercial Independent Television's ``TV-AM''
breakfast show in the 1980s by promoting a puppet called Roland
Rat.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, at the commercial London Weekend Television,
he commissioned such programs as ``Blind Date'' and ``Gladiators''
_ the first based on televised romance, the second on displays of
male and female muscle.
</P>
<P>
   At Pearson Television, the broadcasting arm of the Pearson
P.L.C. media group, he supervised the acquisition of All American
Communications, which produces ``Baywatch'' and ``The Price Is
Right.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyke belongs to a coterie of senior broadcasters including Sir
John Birt, who is to retire next March, and Sir Christopher Bland,
the BBC chairman, who is said by BBC insiders to have pushed hard
for Dyke's appointment. All three worked closely together at London
Weekend Television in the '80s and early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually, though, in the patrician world of the public
broadcasting elite, Dyke describes himself as part of what he calls
the ``elevated working class.'' He went to a public grammar school,
not a private school, and worked in jobs that included trainee
store manager and newspaper reporter before starting his
broadcasting career 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a land that calibrates social status in part by people's
accents, he speaks with traces of the so-called estuary English of
southeast England rather than the Oxford English once associated
with the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   But for British politicians the issue has been his affiliation
with Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party. Dyke ran
unsuccessfully as a Labor candidate in a local election in 1977 and
as a young television researcher was seen as a radical labor
unionist, threatening employers with strikes if they did not pay
overtime for the time their staff spent reading newspapers at home.
</P>
<P>
   Since then his radicalism has mellowed somewhat: as a
cost-cutting television executive, he was reported to have garnered
some $13 million in a stock option plan that paid off when London
Weekend Television was taken over by Granada Group in 1994.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the Conservative opposition still does not trust him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the current climate of Labor cronyism, we are concerned
that the appointment of Dyke, who has given recent and substantial
financial support to the Labor Party, may be prejudicial to the
BBC's reputation,'' said Hague, the Conservative leader.
</P>
<P>
   In a well-publicized race, Dyke fought off challenges from three
other candidates. The BBC's board of governors said that after a
``rigorous dialogue'' during the selection process, the board had
concluded that Dyke ``would be determined and able to protect the
BBC's independence, reputation for impartiality and resist pressure
from whatever source.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Blair denied any interference in the selection.
``It's a matter for the BBC,'' his office said.
</P>
<P>
   Dyke will face an array of challenges. Apart from low morale,
the BBC has been losing out to private terrestrial and satellite
broadcasters in an increasingly bitter war for sports broadcast
rights and for the digital television market that is seen as a key
to the way people watch television in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Media analysts said Dyke would be closely watched for the way he
seeks to secure financing for the BBC, whether from an increased
license fee or from an expansion of foreign commercial activities,
like a deal it has with the Discovery Channel. ``I'm clearly a
supporter of the license fee, and I'm clearly a supporter of an
independently funded BBC,'' he said Friday.

MUCH AT STAKE IN BOEING-MACHINISTS LABOR TALKS, AND MANY ARE
WATCHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The International Association of Machinists and The
Boeing Co. will kick off negotiations for a new contract Tuesday,
and both sides hope history doesn't repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the two groups met at the bargaining table, in
1995, the Machinists struck for 69 days, crippling production. As
union leaders prepare to hand their contract proposal to Boeing
executives at a formal ceremony in Wichita, Kan., both groups are
claiming they learned valuable lessons from the 1995 fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more sensitive to the fine art of contract
negotiations ... on both sides,'' said David Olson, a political
science professor at the University of Washington in Seattle. ``If
you want to write a scenario about the negotiating process breaking
down, (1995) was a classic example.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have a lot at stake. Workers are fighting to preserve
their generous health care benefits, retain their traditional work
week, improve their pensions and protect their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, meanwhile, enters the talks fighting to transform into a
leaner company and to bolster its image in the eyes of investors.
Executives say they want to avoid labor disruptions, but they can't
afford to be perceived as caving into the union, according to some
financial analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Even though negotiators from both camps say a strike is
unlikely, it's far from certain it can be avoided. Workers struck
in two of the past three rounds of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question will be `can they reach an agreement?'''
said Peter Jacobs, a Seattle-based analyst for the Ragen MacKenzie
Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Although negotiations begin Tuesday, the two sides have been
talking for months. They already have agreed to suspend new
subcontracting and protect a group of maintenance jobs through
Sept. 1. The efforts have set a positive tone as the parties head
into the talks, according to Jeff Pittsburg, an analyst at
Goldis-Pittsburg Institutional Services Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is one of the keys that better relates management to
employees. ... This is no longer them or us,'' Pittsburg said.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations begin as both the Machinists and the company
stand at crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing workers are facing the prospect of up to 53,000
additional layoffs through the end of 2000, as the company strives
to lower costs and become more efficient, in part by turning to
more outside contractors. To offset the cuts, the union will seek a
greater voice in corporate decisions to hire outside companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a greater voice now. ... Is it where we want to be?
No,'' said Bill Johnson, president of the union's District Lodge
751. ``Our members want assurances they can have a job.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey, union members said hiring outside U.S.
companies is the greatest threat to their jobs, placing it above
competition from Airbus Industrie and an economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boeing officials have indicated they're flexible on
this issue, ultimately their company must retain authority to make
the decisions, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side will discuss details of any contract proposals.
However, Boeing could try to resolve the subcontracting issue by
offering bonuses worth 8 percent to 10 percent, higher than
traditional contract offers, according to some financial analysts.
In exchange, the company would secure the flexibility it wants to
hire outsiders, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's generous health care benefits will also be a key
point of contention. Machinists want to preserve the existing
package, one of the last in the region where the company picks up
the entire tab. The company is searching for savings.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing faces a different set of challenges. The aerospace giant
is being buffeted on one side by Airbus Industrie, the consortium
of European nations that has been devouring a greater share of the
airplane market, and by investors on the other side, who are
demanding a more efficient, and more profitable, company.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is paying close attention to the talks. That's
because a prolonged disruption would snarl production lines,
further eroding investors' confidence in the company just as it's
striving to rebuild its image.
</P>
<P>
   If Boeing can avoid a strike, and the accompanying production
problems, its stature would rise in the financial markets. Boeing
managers would also prefer not to slow production since the company
has pledged to deliver a record 620 planes to customers this year.
</P>
<P>
   The contract is also a major component of Boeing's balance
sheet. Union machinists represented 21 percent of the company's $12
billion payroll in 1998, the company said. And the agreement is
sure to serve as a model for other labor contracts throughout the
massive company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would put them right at the top'' among the company's
priorities, said Paul Nisbet, an aerospace analyst at JSA Research
Inc. in Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing negotiators must walk a fine line, however.
</P>
<P>
   While financial analysts want the company to come to terms with
the Machinists, and keep delivering airplanes to its customers,
they don't want it to give away the store simply to secure peace
with its biggest union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see them get tough ... a little bit tougher with
the union,'' said Christopher Mecray, an analyst at Deutsche Banc
Alex Brown.
</P>
<P>
   To walk that line, Boeing has assembled a new team of senior
executives. Jerry Calhoun, seasoned as chairman of the Federal
Labor Relations Authority during the Reagan administration, took
over as the company's top negotiator in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are better off than we were in `95,'' Calhoun said
recently.
</P>
<P>
   And the former chief financial officer of General Motors Europe,
Debby Hopkins, came on board last year in the same role for Boeing.
Hopkins already is drawing rave reviews from Wall Street analysts,
as she helps develop a plan to pare unprofitable products and
services from the company. She could outline some decisions, which
may influence the contract negotiations, this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest change is the addition of Harry Stonecipher,
who joined the company as president after Boeing acquired McDonnell
Douglas Corp. in 1997. Stonecipher is a vocal supporter of
controlling Boeing's costs and is disliked by many rank-and-file
Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, only 10 percent of union respondents in a survey saw
Stonecipher in a favorable light, while 56 percent saw him
unfavorably.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming labor talks are also drawing interest from beyond
the confines of Boeing and Wall Street. Executives and labor
leaders from around the world are scrutinizing the cooperative
approach leading into the negotiations for lessons that could help
their own labor relations, according to scholars.
</P>
<P>
   They are also sure to track how the two sides settle the issues
of ``outsourcing'' and health care, according to the University of
Washington's Olson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing is simply so important and so big (and) its reputation
is such that it commands not just national but worldwide attention.
There is the pattern of trend setting,'' Olson said.

KOURNIKOVA NEEDS NO SPOTLIGHT TO ADVANCE AT WIMBLEDON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ What greater cruelty to mankind could there be than
marooning the Glitter Girl of Wimbledon _ Anna Kournikova _ on
Court 2 for all three of her engagements?
</P>
<P>
   Is this a conspiracy, a cover-up? Here she is, Her Highness of
Hype, getting more ink and photo coverage than the entire
dysfunctional royal family, the prime minister, and the champion
Manchester United soccer team _ and she's banished to a back lot
where only a smattering of the record crowds can squeeze in to bask
in her glow. This just ain't cricket. Or tennis, either.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Kournikova's complaining. A tennis court has the same
dimensions wherever, and she's 3-0 on this one. Thus Anna entered
the Round of 16 Friday by scoring a TKO (7-5, 3-1) over Ines
Gorrochategui, who surrendered with a shoulder injury. But it's
Anna's dimensions that intrigue some patrons of the game, mainly
male. Mournful complaints from such were heard outside Court 2, an
overgrown closet with a capacity of 2,220.
</P>
<P>
   Just across the walkway is Centre Court, holding 13,813.
``That's where Anna belongs, every time she plays,'' wailed Dave
Tashjian, a New Yorker. ``I've got tickets for Centre Court, but
Court 2's where she's happening, and I can't get in.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, guys were trying to climb the fences and being
shooed by stewards. Others were standing in a long line at the
grandstand, hoping that somebody inside would swoon at the sight of
the Glitter Girl and be carried out to make room for another
viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Hormones are hopping whenever Anna's around. Young men bayed for
her from the rooftops next to the stadium at Eastbourne, the
Wimbledon tuneup, and she returned their mating calls with smiles
that matched her golden costume. Gold is selling very short these
days in the Kournikova-model ensembles, although the rules here
require everyone to wear pristine white.
</P>
<P>
   But Wimbledon hasn't yet had the full benefit of her 18-year-old
attractions in whatever shade. She's been stuffed away in an
enclosure usually known as the Graveyard Court because so many
favorites have been interred there by lesser lights. But for some
disappointed attendees, entombing Anna at 2 has been like
consigning Cindy Crawford to a burnoose and veil or casting Julia
Roberts as a nun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair,'' moaned another guy who'd been shut out. ``All
we see in the papers is Anna, but all I see here is a green wall
separating me from her.'' The life of a tennis connoisseur can be
frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   London's tabloids splash Kournikova all over the place and
suggest at numerous romances, which she denies with ``No comment!''
after ``No comment!'' But even a female columnist of a serious
sheet, The Times's Lynne Truss, applauds: ``Anna capitalizes on the
most common posture in sport _ i.e. flexing your legs and sticking
your bottom out.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Cold War were still on, you might suspect a CIA plot here
to keep the Russian blonde from getting too much attention and
making Communism alluring. Hiding Kournikova seems like something
out of the old days in Boston, where the Watch and Ward Society
frowned on titillation. It was surprising that no protesters
marched outside 2 with LIBERATE ANNA signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least,'' said the renowned photographer Russo Adamo, ``Anna
has made it to the second week. Last year, a sad one for all of us,
she was injured and not even here.''
</P>
<P>
   However, better days must be coming for those of the Kourni
Kraze persuasion. On Monday, the tournament committee certainly
will have to uncover her on either Centre or Court 1 with its
11,429 seats. She'll be up against Venus Williams, Friday crunched
Sarah Pitkowski, 6-1, 6-1, also on Court 2.
</P>
<P>
   Sex, of course, has always done well at Wimbledon, despite
official frowns. This temple of tennis was constructed on the
strength of Parisienne Suzanne Lenglen's magnetism. Once Suzanne
showed up in 1919 to begin her unbeaten run of six titles, Centre
Court over on Worple Road (about the size of today's Court 2) was
inadequate for the mobs that overwhelmed the place to see more of
her than any previous champion.
</P>
<P>
   In her airy, limb-freeing costumes, Suzanne wiped out the age of
shoetop dresses and whalebone corsets. So prim and disapproving was
the reaction that the ``new'' (present) Wimbledon was hurriedly
built in time for her fourth title in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   You can bet they never enshrouded Suzanne on Court 2. You don't
see Steffi Graf there. Maybe if Anna _ No. 17 in the world but No.
1 in the camera lenses _ wins the title, she'll be out of that
closet forever.

MCNEELEY-ESCH: 12-MINUTE MAIN EVENT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ As four-round fights go, this one will be about as
strange as any in boxing history.
</P>
<P>
   When Peter McNeeley tries to exorcise the memory of his last
trip to Las Vegas by going up against cult hero Butterbean Esch on
the undercard of the Johnny Tapia-Paulie Ayala/Stevie Johnston-Aldo
Rios championship doubleheader at Mandalay Bay, it will be a
preliminary fight that is being treated like a 12-minute main
event.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom is it possible to place a legal bet on such a bout, even
in Las Vegas, but McNeeley is an 8-1 underdog who bet $1,000 on
himself this week at the Las Vegas Hilton. That remains the only
money in his name, while someone has reportedly put down $13,000
against him for a chance to make $1,500, a questionable risk/reward
ratio unless you think you've got a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom does such a fight show up on TV, yet it is listed as the
semi-main event in Showtime's broadcast, sandwiched between
Johnston's title defense and the Tapia-Ayala main event.
</P>
<P>
   And practically never does such a fight have what McNeeley and
Butterbean's had Thursday afternoon _ a televised, private weigh-in
the day before the rest of the card stepped on the scales. TV
cameras were rolling, and both fighters ended up on ESPN's
``SportsCenter'' at 11 because McNeeley is McNeeley, after all, and
the 318-pound Butterbean is the owner of an odd but lucrative place
in boxing after being converted from a tough-man contest winner to,
well, a tough-man contest winner.
</P>
<P>
   The Bean long ago laid claim to a nonexistent title, ``King of
the Four Rounders,'' and eventually he convinced someone
(admittedly, the fledgling International Boxing Association) to
give him a ``title'' belt to back it up. Along the way, he has also
made several hundred thousand dollars as a kind of working man's
champion, a title McNeeley (45-4) would love to wrestle from him.
Literally if necessary, the Bean understands.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's coming to fight, and so am I,'' Butterbean (44-1-1, 33
KOs) said. ``The boxing purists don't like me, but real boxing is
boring. Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield was your typical boxing
match. It was boring. Trust me, people don't want to see two men
hugging and clinching.
</P>
<P>
   ``If McNeeley fights like he fought Tyson (charging across the
ring at the former heavyweight champion and winging wild punches
until he was dropped three times), it will be the fight of the
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but for McNeeley this is more than a circus act: It
could be his final act. After losing in 89 seconds to Tyson four
years ago, McNeeley has seen his life take some sad turns. He's
gone into drug rehab, been ill-treated by many fight fans who
consider him a bad joke, and tried without distinction or success
to prove that his small place on boxing's big stage is deserved.
</P>
<P>
   He made that point with force Wednesday, during a teary press
conference in which he bared his soul to the public. When he was
finished, the crowd cheered him, and he promised to prove that he
belongs on a card whose main event features one of the 10 best
fighters in the world, Tapia.
</P>
<P>
   Tapia (46-0-2) has not lost a fight in his 11-year professional
career, and he will be making his first defense of the World Boxing
Association bantamweight title he won Dec. 5 from Nana Konadu.
Frankly, he and challenger Paulie Ayala (27-1) are everything
McNeeley and Butterbean are not.
</P>
<P>
   They are smooth boxers who slip punches, land often, punch to
the body as well as the head, and move gracefully around the ring.
The same is true of Johnston (26-1), who won back the World Boxing
Council lightweight title in his last fight and is defending it
against Aldo Rios (20-0), a light-hitting challenger who has never
fought outside his native Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The two champions and Ayala are the polar opposite of brawlers
such as McNeeley and Butterbean, yet promoter Bob Arum acknowledged
this week that, frankly, more people are talking about the circus
than the opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fight I want to see and everyone wants to see,''
Arum said. ``Johnny is everything the sweet science ought to be,
but there's been so much betting action on McNeeley-Esch the odds
went from 2-1 to 8-1. We've got the super heavyweight king of the
four rounders and a guy who is a real fighter, and I can't wait to
see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange as it may be, Bob Arum is not alone.

ADL, INVENTOR SUE GILLETTE IN PATENT DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Arthur D. Little Enterprises and a California inventor
have sued Gillette Co., claiming the shaving giant infringed on a
1995 patent for a disposable razor with a built-in indicator.
</P>
<P>
   The suit filed Thursday in US District Court in Wilmington,
Del., claims Gillette's best-selling Mach3 shaving system includes
disposable cartridges that ``embody the invention'' of Siamak
Doroodian-Shoja, who for several years tried to sell the idea to
Gillette _ going so far as to license the patent to Arthur D.
Little, the Cambridge consulting firm, to help bring the idea to
market.
</P>
<P>
   The inventor obtained a patent in February 1995 for a ``wear
indicator'' that is gradually worn down by beard abrasion,
revealing a bright strip alerting users that the blade needs
replacing, the suit says. The suit seeks an unspecified award
``adequate to compensate'' the inventor for being ``irreparably
damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillete spokesman Eric Kraus Friday called the suit
``preposterous'' and said the company had obtained patents on
Mach3's indicator strip well before the inventor's 1995 patent.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Mach3's indicator strip _ which starts out blue
then fades as the razor is used _ works in a different way than
Doroodian-Shoja's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no patent infringement here at all,'' Kraus said.
``But we're not surprised someone would try to capitalize on the
phenomenal success more than a year after it was introduced.''
</P>
<P>
   After being rolled out in April 1998, the premium-priced,
triple-bladed Mach3 shaving system became an almost instant
worldwide hit, capturing some 17 percent of the market in the
United States and 13 percent abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Kraus said Gillette officials discussed buying the patent from
Doroodian-Shoja at one time. But ``we felt the patent was too
narrow and even that it didn't have any scientific merit,'' Kraus
said.

JILLSON AT THE TOP OF EVERYBODY'S DRAFT LISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- When he spotted Bobby Orr off behind the glass at the
end of the little rink in Milton, Jeff Jillson gave gave Orr a
wave, defenseman to defenseman. Orr, the fullest defensive package
of all time, Jillson dreaming and hoping and working so hard to be
a bit of the same, stay-at-home first, but carry the puck, too.
</P>
<P>
   Red Berenson had chuckled at a memory. There was one game this
season when Jillson had the puck at the point ``and the other
team's defenseman went down,'' said the Michigan coach, a former
Canadien who had seen Orr make a similar move against his Montreal
team time and again, ``and Jeff moved around him and then another
guy went down and Jeff pulled the puck around him and then went in
and deked out the goalie. Usually, you don't get away with things
like that in top-level hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   A memorable goal. So Berenson was asked if he remembered the
name of the opposing team. Berenson said he didn't, ``but I'm sure
if you ask Jeff, he'd know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It came against Lake Superior State,'' said Jillson, who could
be the first North American defenseman taken in the National Hockey
League draft at the FleetCenter. Jillson then was asked to describe
the goal and his reply was the usual humble answer that hockey
players give when asked to talk about themselves. ``What upset
me,'' he said, ``was that we lost the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jillson is from North Smithfield, R.I., and most certainly looks
the part of an NHL defenseman. He is 6 feet 3 inches and 215
pounds, can skate, can shoot, and his plus-minus numbers have
always been on the positive side. The bird dogs and denizens of the
Central Scouting Bureau note that Jillson ``has come a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Scouts and personnel guys have come in waves to Berenson's
office in Ann Arbor, Mich. Some might ask this and others might ask
that about a prospect but, at the end, ``they all ask the same
question,'' said Berenson. `` `Can this boy play in the National
Hockey League?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Berenson said yes, of course. After all, he recruited Jillson
and somehow extricated him from New England and the clutches of the
Hockey East powers, especially Shawn Walsh in Maine. Even more, the
Michigan coach saw Jillson blossom last season as a freshman for
the Wolverines.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, nobody knows for sure who can play in the NHL. Even
now. Even with the draft only hours away. Proof enough was skating
along with Jillson and other top draftees at the Milton rink.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins defenseman Hal Gill had so little hope for the 1993 draft
he said he barely knew there was a draft underway. Gill was the
203d player taken that year and is a solid player for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Grier of the Edmonton Oilers was also skating with Jillson
at the Milton rink and, unlike Gill, he did have hopes for the
draft of 1993. ``I remember the draft was up in Quebec that year,''
said Grier, ``and a bunch of us guys from St. Sebastian's (prep
school) all decided to drive up there. I remember waiting a long,
long time'' to hear his name chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Grier was taken even lower than Gill, selected 209th by the St.
Louis Blues. Like Gill, Grier is a fixture now in the NHL, even
though the scouts once regarded them more or less as afterthoughts.
They had that certain inner ``something''.
</P>
<P>
   Jillson, though, may be selected as high as 10th to 15th, and
his future seems very bright. Best of all, said Berenson, Jillson
also has that inner ``something.'' Berenson tried putting it into
words, noting Jillson ``obviously has size and toughness.'' Not to
be forgotten is how well he changed from an offensive threat at
Mount St. Charles Academy in Woonsocket, R.I. to a complete
defenseman at Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson has seen all kinds of hotshots come to Michigan, high
school wunderkinds who suddenly are facing players as good as
themselves. Over the years, Berenson has learned an indicator as to
which player will succeed in college. The indicator, said Berenson,
is whether the player is humble or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some kids are just not as coachable,'' said the coach, ``and
usually these kids don't get better. But humble kids do get better.
The challenge is to take the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Jillson is humble. ``Jeff comes from a good
family,'' said his coach, ``and he has good values.'' He is a
student as well as an athlete, winning academic honors at Mount St.
Charles and performing well at Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Jillson came to Michigan and did not remain in New
England also states volumes. ``It takes a lot of toughness and
fortitude to leave his comfort zone (in New England),'' said
Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Jillson could have remained in New England but he wanted
the personal challenge of going to an entirely new part of country.
Jillson said he didn't choose Michigan over Maine because the
Wolverines won the NCAA hockey championship at the FleetCenter just
when he was making up his mind. But it helped.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the real reason was that Jillson intended to be at
Michigan a year earlier. His former teammate, defenseman Bryan
Berard, left Mount St. Charles a year early to play juniors, the
year Jillson arrived at the Mount, and Berard, now with the Maple
Leafs, was the first player taken in the NHL draft four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of comparisons between us,'' said Jillson,
who planned to leave for junior hockey in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was heading to Plymouth (the Plymouth Township, Mich.,
Whalers, a junior team of the Red Wings) and they were playing in
the Ontario Hockey League and I was going to enter the draft after
my junior season of high school,'' said Jillson. ``That was my
plan, to go to Plymouth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jillson came down with mononucleosis in June, just after his
junior year at Mount St. Charles, and junior hockey soon was out of
the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd come down with mono the end of June and that knocked me
down the whole summer,'' he said. ``I mean, I was still sick until
November and December and I was out of shape and I hadn't skated.
Most of all, I'd wanted to be an impact player in the OHL and I
just didn't feel like I could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   So Jillson remained in Rhode Island, won another state title
with the Mounties, and finished high school. Jillson found Ann
Arbor to his liking and Berenson was happy to have a quality
defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike forwards, said Berenson of hockey's age-old truth,
``defensemen are judged by their mistakes. Forwards are judged by
what they do, defensemen by what they don't do. A good defenseman
is hardly noticed. Jeff was like that.''
</P>
<P>
   By early Saturday afternoon, Jillson's name will be selected by
an NHL team. For the last two days he has been grilled by NHL
personnel seeking that elusive ``something''. Then Jillson will
talk with his parents, Berenson, and others about returning to Ann
Arbor for his sophomore season.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Brian Lawton of Mount St. Charles was the first player
taken in the draft. In later years, Mathieu Schneider, Keith
Carney, Berard, and others from the Mount have been selected. Now
it's Jillson's turn.

`INSIDE PICTURE BOOKS:' THE WISDOM IN PICTURE BOOKS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to add publication notes)  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am pointing to the ever-darkening pictures in ``Goodnight
Moon,'' a book that has left its mark on three generations of
children. ``In the great, green room,'' I chant, hardly needing to
look at the text as I mention the red balloon, the cow, the bears,
the moon ...
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, sitting by a window through which a full moon
shines, my daughter, too young to talk, is struck by mental
lightning. Again and again she leaps from the book's pictures,
gesturing toward the night sky, making a connection that is as
profound as Helen Keller's identifying water with silent, fingered
symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Handler Spitz, a lecturer in the art department at
Stanford University, will perhaps forgive this memory's intrusion
on a review of her ``Inside Picture Books,'' because that sort of
personal involvement is just what she is exploring. She tells, for
example, of one elderly woman who has shunned chamomile tea all her
life because it was the seemingly punishing beverage Mother Rabbit
gave to mischievous Peter.
</P>
<P>
   Such indelibly intimate responses are the result of what Ms.
Spitz calls ``conversational reading.'' New forms of mental life
are created by children's picture books. The words are not silently
read but are spoken aloud. The pictures are not illustrations of
text but creators of meanings. The most central figure may not be
Madeline or the Cat in the Hat but the parent whose voice shapes
the child's first sense of the world and whose pointing finger
articulates its objects and images. The child is ``transported into
the realm of the uncanny'' by the parent: a source of fear and
comfort who enacts dramas in which fear and comfort are
intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   There is something fine and rare in Ms. Spitz's book, with its
interpretations of picture books ranging from Margaret Wise Brown's
``Goodnight Moon'' to Marjorie Flack's ``Story About Ping.''
Despite the references to Magritte and van Gogh, and analyses that
are influenced by Bettleheim, Freud and Piaget, Ms. Spitz speaks to
her readers not as an academic but as a practiced reader-aloud,
knowing the relationships that exist between a storyteller and
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   If, in the preface, she risks sentimentality in urging her
readers to ``enjoy your children'' and ``treasure the days of your
life that are spent in their company,'' that admonition is
suggestive of her compassionate and passionate readings.
</P>
<P>
   Not just any picture book will do. Ms. Spitz recalls, for
example, a recent clearance sale of such books as ``My Big Sister
Takes Drugs,'' ``I Wish Daddy Didn't Drink So Much,'' and ``Our
Teacher's in a Wheelchair.'' While acknowledging that these titles
may occasionally serve a purpose, she argues that they pale before
others, more resonant with metaphor and allusion; such classic
books strengthen children in ``their ongoing discovery of the
limitations of the real.'' A list of all-time best-selling
children's books that appeared in Publishers Weekly a few years ago
is almost the opposite of its adult counterpart: it is dominated by
classics of the genre.
</P>
<P>
   What allows such books to be so popular and so powerful?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spitz's use of the word ``uncanny'' is suggestive. Great
picture books seem to dwell on a border between worlds: between
childhood and adulthood, fantasy and realism, darkness and light.
They mark transitions, dramatize transformations, and reproduce the
tensions that lie latent between parent and listener.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spitz suggests that they also literally lead from day into
night, that a picture book's ``fundamental message will have to do
with its being the last human contact before sleep.'' In a sense,
she points out, every picture book is a bedtime story, not just
``Bedtime for Frances'' or ``Harold and the Purple Crayon'' or ``In
the Night Kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Spitz's fine interpretation of ``Goodnight Moon,'' her
themes converge. Nothing happens, but the coming of night, with the
child (a bunny) first surveying the great, green room and its
objects and then releasing them with the coming of sleep. As Ms.
Spitz shows, this is ``not a pastel book.'' It incorporates the
vaguely sinister: a tiger rug, a cat eyeing a mouse, the
encroaching darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Like other children's classics the book encompasses dangers
without nullifying them; they become part of the child's
experience. Every assurance is tinged with worry and every worry
tempered by assurance, much like the nature of the final farewell
of the parent upon finishing the book, leaving the child alone in a
dark room.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Ms. Spitz's analyses are overdone (the reading of ``In
the Night Kitchen'' is too Holocaust haunted), and some themes
might have been more systematically developed. On the issue of
gender she also tends to use too crude an interpretive grid. For
example: Are there really many more picture books about boys than
girls? Not in my experience and not in the list Ms. Spitz herself
provides as a bibliography.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Madeline,'' like other picture books, plays with gender
expectations _ Madeline is boyish, her post-appendicitis gifts are
girlish _ these gifts do not seem to be rewards ``for assuming her
designated gender role.'' Ms. Spitz often treats gender
differences, which are central to picture books, as if they were
arbitrarily ``designated'' by cultural history, even though she
otherwise spurns ``scholars who want to historicize everything.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Reading aloud, as Ms. Spitz argues, is an
extraordinary gift for children, unmatched by any promise of new
media. It is also a gift for the parent, who becomes practiced in
crossing childhood's boundaries while bearing full knowledge of
what is yet to come, not just in the books themselves but in the
unfolding lives of their listeners. One night, in fact, the
farewell comes from the other direction: the child passes through
those boundaries and turns away from the parent's reading voice,
ready to proceed into texts in solemn and silent solitude.

CORPORATE PROFITS GAIN LEADS LATEST ECONOMIC REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government reported Friday that corporate profits rose at a
rate of 6.3 percent in the first quarter _ two percentage points
higher than previously estimated and the biggest quarterly gain in
five years.
</P>
<P>
   The news, combined with a slightly higher than estimated growth
in gross domestic product in the first quarter, confirmed the
economy's remarkable expansion continues.
</P>
<P>
   But the rosier numbers contained no big surprises for analysts
who are considering what the Reserve Board will do when it meets
next week to discuss interest-rate policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't change our picture of the first quarter at all,''
Cynthia Latta, an economist for Standard &AMP; Poor's/DRI in Lexington,
said about the new reports.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market reacted with a shrug. After four consecutive
down days from Monday through Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial
average stock index rose 17.73 points Friday to close at 10,552.6.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by a
quarter percentage point when members meet next week, but not
because there are any signs of inflation in the US economy. Rather,
members fear that if the Fed does not act to cool down growth and
the expansion goes on too long, it could cause inflationary
pressures to build in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts are now looking ahead to what data for the second
quarter, which ends June 30, will show. Economists anticipate a
modest slowing in GDP growth to a rate of about 3 percent. The wild
card is consumer spending, which has been propelling the economy
and remains very strong.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department said gross domestic product, or GDP,
expanded at a 4.3 percent annual rate from January through March,
instead of 4.1 percent, as estimated earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate profits, which had been estimated at 4.3 percent,
posted the biggest upward revision. Pre-tax profits fattened at a
6.3 percent rate in the first three months this year, a sharp
turnaround from last year's fourth quarter when profits shrank by
1.7 percent as tobacco companies paid money out to settle lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce said the 6.3 percent rise in profits was the highest
for any quarter since a 14.9 percent increase in the second quarter
of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The government cited a narrowing of the trade deficit as a key
reason the GDP numbers exceeded estimates. Exports rose faster than
expected and imports were lower as a brightening economic picture
in Asia improved overseas sales opportunities and stimulated a
pickup in US manufacturing activity.

VOICESTREAM, OMNIPOINT FOUND A FIT IN EACH OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When you're a small cellular service provider using
the least popular technology in America, just trying harder may not
be good enough.
</P>
<P>
   So John Stanton, chairman and chief executive of Bellevue's
VoiceStream Wireless Corp., and Doug Smith, his counterpart at
Omnipoint Corp. of Bethesda, Md., decided to join forces. Wednesday
night they created a merged entity with assets of $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, already approved by the boards and shareholders of
both companies, creates the second largest PCS (digital cellular
service) license holder in the nation and the fourth largest in
terms of people within the licensed areas, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   It will hold licenses to serve more than 175 million people
across the country, in 17 of the top 25 markets.
</P>
<P>
   The merger ``creates some massive scale for the company,'' said
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst Jeffrey Hines.
</P>
<P>
   Before the merger, at opposite ends of the country, both
companies had been independently building cellular networks based
on GSM, a cellular technology far more popular in Asia and Europe
than in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   VoiceStream started building its GSM network in the west and
midwest. It currently serves 450,000 customers in 11 markets within
13 western states. Service areas include Denver, Phoenix, Portland,
Salt Lake City and Seattle. Dallas and Chicago are next.
</P>
<P>
   Omnipoint serves the Northeast and Midwest, with nearly 380,000
customers in Boston, Detroit, Miami, New York and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, cellular giant AT&AMP;T Wireless Services uses a
competing technology _ time division multiple access, or TDMA _
while mega-provider Sprint PCS uses code division multiple access,
or CDMA. Most customers don't know or care about the difference,
but it matters to the providers, because the three systems are
incompatible. Building a nationwide system around one of the
systems requires a massive investment in FCC licenses, cellular
relay towers, and other hardware.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is either to make a massive investment or find a
partner.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton and Smith, aided by a team of nearly 25 people, pursued
the latter course, launching the new company on Wednesday in the
offices of a New York law firm. The new company, which will retain
the VoiceStream Wireless name, will challenge the big guys, execs
say.
</P>
<P>
   The objective: to acquire the size and scope to provide
customers with a nationwide network for local, long distance and
data.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the GSM providers, who are a series of independent
companies, don't have is the ability to offer nationwide rate
plans,'' said Don Guthrie, VoiceStream's vice chairman and
director. ``I'd be very surprised if we don't have a nationwide
plan by the end of next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton in prepared remarks said the merged company will be
better positioned than either company alone to offer service to
major customers like large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will let VoiceStream save costs by
combining functions like billing and customer service, analysts
said. It will also reduce what VoiceStream pays other carriers to
serve its customers when they travel around the country.
</P>
<P>
   To finance its expansion, VoiceStream got additional cash from
Cook Inlet Region Inc., an Anchorage corporation with investments
in communications, tourism and real estate. That company invested
an undisclosed amount to form joint ventures to acquire licenses
from Omnipoint.
</P>
<P>
   In the third piece of Wednesday's deal, Hutchison
Telecommunications PCS (USA) Ltd., which already held 24 percent of
VoiceStream's stock, said it will invest another $957 million in
the combined company, including $150 million of preferred Omnipoint
stock. The investment will give Hutchison, whose parent company is
based in Hong Kong, approximately a 30 percent share of the
combined company.
</P>
<P>
   VoiceStream will exchange 0.825 shares of its common stock, plus
$8 in cash, for each share of Omnipoint common stock. The merger is
set to close in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory approvals.
</P>
<P>
   The next step for the new company is to ``start rolling up the
other GSM players,'' said Paul Judge, director of The Walter Group,
a Seattle telecommunications consulting and development company.
``John Stanton is a strong horse, and the financial community loves
him. Wall Street was looking for the horse to roll up all the GSM
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton _ by most accounts the main force behind the merger _
will remain the chairman and chief executive of VoiceStream.
</P>

   Smith will become a vice-chairman of VoiceStream, leading the

   Those two ``have talked weekly for three years now, and it was
probably in the back of their minds five years ago,'' he said. He
couldn't say when talks first became serious.

   ``Those guys are entrepreneurs,'' Guthrie said. ``They have the
force, vitality, energy to drive an idea forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Other VoiceStream execs took on varied roles during the
negotiations, which Guthrie, an experienced financier, described as
extremely complex. His role was to coordinate Voice-Stream's and
Omnipoint's legal teams. Cregg Baumbaugh, VoiceStream's executive
vice president for finance, strategy and development, was the chief
negotiator with Cook. Alan Bender, general counsel, spent about
forty hours straight with his Omnipoint counterpart.

   ``If a day off qualifies as less than four hours, I think I had
one over the past two weeks, but I'm not sure when,'' he said.

KERR   GIVING IT HIS BEST SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The idea was that after the ball went into David
Robinson or Tim Duncan it would come back out to Steve Kerr and he
would calmly stick a jumper, or perhaps even a three. After all,
isn't that the way it always seemed to work in Chicago?
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't worked that way. The man who three times shot in
excess of 50 percent as a Bull while taking it to the hoop about
once a month shot 39 percent during the regular season as a Spur
and has been a steady nonfactor as in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But is he brooding? You kidding? He's about to be a champion for
the fourth straight year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been frustrating in an individual sense,'' he admitted on
the eve of Game 5. ``But it's been rewarding in a team sense. And
that's why I came here. I knew we had a chance to win. It makes up
for a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kerr offers no excuses for his subpar performance. Most
people familiar with the game recognize that he left an optimum
situation for him in favor of just the type of circumstance he had
known in his five pre-Chicago years. He is not exactly in the upper
percentile of the league's superior athletes, and he had severe
problems getting open for his jumpers as he slid from Phoenix to
Cleveland and Orlando before striking career gold with a five-year
stay in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if he's never been open as a Spur. But somehow it
has not been the same for him as it was in Chicago, where he was
one of the league's most feared open shooters. He does, after all,
hold both the career (.463) and single-season (.524) record for
highest 3-point percentage, and that was compiled in the 1994-95
season, the year when Michael sat out until March.
</P>
<P>
   ``The triangle offense was ideal for me,'' he said. ``There
isn't any question that if I hadn't signed with Chicago in 1994 I'd
be doing something else today. I had no other offers at the time.
Four or five teams were willing to invite me to camp with no
guarantees. There were no guarantees from Chicago, either, but I
just felt that was my best shot at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   That led to a successful carer in Chicago, during which time
Kerr earned three rings. He would come in time after time to nail a
big three or provide a couple of pressure-relieving 18-footers. The
absolute highlight came when he took a pass and swished a foul-line
jump shot that clinched Game 6 against Utah in 1997 and gave
Chicago the fifth of its six titles in the 90s. It was a case of a
team deciding that Michael wasn't going to beat them, and Kerr was
quite willing to perform the task himself.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is a Spur, and he is, along with teammate Will Perdue, in
position to compare two very different championship teams.
</P>
<P>
   He cautions everyone not to get ahead of the story. He plays on
a good team, but he would like people to recognize that the Spurs
aren't the Bulls. ``That team won six titles,'' he pointed out.
``After the first title, there was a cockiness about them. This
team has yet to win one. Once we do it, the team may develop that
deep-seated confidence the Bulls had, but it will have to win one
first.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls were built around two fabulous mid-range players. The
Spurs are built around a pair of agile and athletic 7-footers. And
in case you've forgotten, one of those quality mid-range players
the Bulls had on their side was the greatest player ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be off-limits to discuss anyone playing today in
comparison to those Chicago teams.'' Kerr said. ``There was never a
presence like Michael Jordan. If I were comparing teams, I would
never bet against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerr doesn't dwell on all this. He was only addressing the
situation because he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciated it while I was there; no question,'' he said.
``But I try not to think about it too much. When I retire, I'm sure
I'll be thinking about it some more.''
</P>
<P>
   He was pressed a little more, and now it was time to make the
case for his current team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this team were playing the Bulls, the big question would
be, `How are we going to deal with Michael and Scottie (Pippen)?'
'' he said. ``And if the Bulls were playing the Spurs, the big
question would be, `How are they going to deal with David and Tim?'
It would all be very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerr is 33. The reason for his poor shooting this year may have
only a little to do with not playing in the triangle offense and a
lot more to do with the possibility that he is simply on the down
side. If so, he will have nothing to apologize for. He was lucky to
find a proper home at a critical juncture in his career, sure, but
no one being asked to do what he did could have done it any better.
</P>
<P>
   There have been recent signs that his shot has been coming back.
It's not as if the Knicks were going to leave Steve Kerr alone,
particularly in the late stages of a close game. The Jazz did that
two years ago, and after he released the ball, they were going
home.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27)  
 (af)  
 By ROY FURCHGOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE, Md. _ Mark A. and Anastasia B. Edmonston are the sort
of people credit card companies hate and mutual fund managers love.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of marriage, Edmonston, 39, a college physics
professor, and his wife, 36, who until recently coordinated an
injury rehabilitation program at Sinai Hospital here, had accrued
combined savings, including those in their retirement accounts, of
more than $235,000 in stocks, bonds and cash. Their combined income
peaked this year at almost $7,700 a month, or about $92,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   They carry no debt other than a mortgage, they pay cash for most
of what they buy, and they contribute as much as they can to their
retirement accounts without depriving themselves or their
daughters, Hannah, 2, and Rachel, 7 months.
</P>
<P>
   But they are at a financial crossroads. Ms. Edmonston recently
quit her job to spend two years working on a master's degree in
special education, a pursuit that will cut their income by nearly
half until she graduates and starts a new career.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they wanted to stay ahead of the financial game, managing
for the next two years without having to dip into the savings they
have put aside for their children's education and a larger house,
let alone their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   They asked for help from a certified financial planner,
Catharine V. Fairley of Keller Brunner Financial Services in
Frederick, Md. Her goal for the couple was more modest. ``I'd like
to see you make it through this period without accumulating debt,''
she told them.
</P>
<P>
   Even that will not be easy. Ms. Edmonston's take-home pay, after
deductions for taxes and savings programs, came to $1,430 a month.
To cover expenses, they will have to find new ways to make up that
amount.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the Edmonstons' finances with them over french fries
at the Phoenix Emporium, a bistro-cum-antique-store in Ellicott
City, Md., Ms. Fairley found little fat to trim. The couple paid
cash for a used 1994 Volvo 850 wagon that costs less than $1,000 a
year to maintain. They are coupon clippers and store-brand buyers.
And Edmonston brown-bags his lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheap!'' he volunteered, raising his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edmonston added that co-workers gave her a gift certificate
before her farewell party, so she could go to a fashionable salon
to have her hair done. ``They were afraid Mark wouldn't let me
go,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonston laughed. Both agreed that even he, the more stringent
saver, is not that Draconian. Still, he prides himself on finding
good dinner wines for $5 a bottle. ``Anyone can find a good bottle
at $10,'' he boasted. ``This is a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Their new situation, though, will demand more than cutting the
wine bill. And there may even be some new expenses: Ms. Fairley
advised spending $50 a month for added life insurance and $80 a
month for long-term disability coverage for Edmonston while his was
the sole income.
</P>
<P>
   One big source of savings, however, may be Ms. Edmonston's new
schedule, which will let her take over some work the couple
previously paid for. Savings on day care and domestic help could be
$690 a month.
</P>
<P>
   As for Edmonston, the planner recommended some ways he could
increase his take-home income.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonston, who is paid twice a month, was putting $236 of each
check into the Towson State University 403(b) retirement plan. Ms.
Fairley suggested that he contribute even more, maximizing his
403(b) payment. With lower family income and the 403(b) adjustment,
his tax bracket would be lower and he could reduce his tax
withholding.
</P>
<P>
   She also advised him to stop having $300 a month of after-tax
money put into his credit union savings account for now, since he
already had more in retirement savings than what she would
recommend as necessary for someone his age.
</P>
<P>
   With the adjustments, Edmonston's take-home pay would rise by
$370 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all those changes, the family would still be $500 a
month short of meeting its monthly budget, Ms. Fairley figured.
That means tapping into principal, though the planner said the
couple could minimize the bite by reinvesting some of the $48,000
they have in checking and savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   For the short term, Ms. Fairley advised that the couple keep a
smaller emergency fund _ $4,000 in a checking account and $10,000
in savings _ than she would usually recommend in longer-term
planning. As a hedge against a huge emergency, she advised opening
a line of credit at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   She also suggested using a combined $4,000 to start Roth IRAs,
forming another kind of cash reserve. ``With a Roth,'' she said,
``you can withdraw your principal with no penalty and no tax
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   That left $30,000 in cash to work with. By shifting $10,000 to a
money market fund and $20,000 to intermediate-term corporate bond
funds, Ms. Fairley said, the Edmonstons could withdraw $500 a month
for 5.8 years before reducing the total to zero.
</P>
<P>
   But the Edmonstons, of course, won't do that. They plan to make
withdrawals for only two years, leaving much of the money for the
future.

OFFICIALS SEE WORST DROUGHT IN DECADE SHAPING UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It's not quite the Dust Bowl of New England yet, but
the drought of 1999 is shaping up as the worst in almost a decade,
federal officials said Friday, as rivers dry up, parched grass
catches on fire and even the region's biggest water supplier
appeals to customers to use less water.
</P>
<P>
   After 31 days without measurable rain, hydrologists at the US
Geological Survey said that water levels in Massachusetts rivers
are already 25 percent lower than they were at this time during the
last drought in 1995. If the trend continues, they said, this year
could rival 1988 when persistent dry heat brought a water crisis
across New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact we are so much lower in June without any long term
expectations of increased rainfall is a real reason for concern,''
said Roy Socolow, chief of the Massachusetts-Rhode Island stream
flow network at the Geological Survey's Northborough office.
</P>
<P>
   Precipitation in southern New England is 15 to 25 percent below
normal for the year, according to the National Weather Service,
with a ``dry and dusty'' weekend ahead.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the main victims have been farmers, forced to irrigate
heavily to keep crops from wilting, and small water suppliers who
have banned most outdoor water use. In addition, the dry conditions
have increased the risk of fires such as a large grass fire in the
Alewife section of Cambridge Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday's call for water conservation from the Massachusetts
Water Resources Authority showed that the drought is taking a toll
even on New England's biggest water supplier. Though MWRA
reservoirs are full, it can't keep up with high water demands,
causing low water pressure in Brighton, Everett, Newton and Saugus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continued hot weather has pushed our system's peak
deliveries . . . to levels that have not been seen in many years,''
said Doug MacDonald, MWRA executive director. He asked customers to
avoid using water outdoors between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. or between 6
p.m. and 10 p.m.

THE ECONOMY'S SILVER LINING IS A DARK CLOUD FOR SOME REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's long run of prosperity has left the
Republican presidential candidates with a crucial strategic choice:
embrace the strong economy as their own, look for the dark side or
change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   But even as they grudgingly acknowledge that a strong economy
helps the incumbent party in national elections _ and grapple with
why their signature economic issue, tax cuts, does not seem to be
lighting any fires among the increasingly well-off middle class _
the Republicans are unwilling to cede the issue to Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The economy could still turn down in the 16 months before
Election Day, and the Federal Reserve's apparent impending decision
to raise interest rates has given a case of jitters to the most
visible indicator of confidence, the stock market. Morever, polling
suggests that voters in the early going are not giving Gore credit
for the economy or much of anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one knows the political power of the economy better
than the Republican front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. He
watched a strong economy help his father, then vice president, win
the presidency in 1988, then watched as a weakened economy
contributed to his father's loss to Bill Clinton four years later.
</P>
<P>
   As he begins his campaign, Bush is openly celebrating, even
highlighting, the nation's prosperity. But he is arguing that the
American people, rather than Clinton or Gore, deserve the credit.
And he is asserting that it is his policies that can best nurture
the expansion and harness it to Republican ends _ while positioning
himself to attack should the economy falter before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole's campaign is betting that good times mean
character and personality will eclipse the economy as an issue.
Steve Forbes says a solid economic foundation provides the
opportunity to address fundamental issues like taxes and education.
Pat Buchanan continues to pound away at the theme of economic
nationalism, saying the global economy is leaving many Americans
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling like his fellow Republicans to move from defense to
offense on the issue, Lamar Alexander is trying a variant on the
question that Ronald Reagan used to skewer Jimmy Carter in the 1980
election: Are you better off than you were four years ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the question is whether we will have a better country
four years from now,'' Alexander said in an interview, all but
conceding that the original formulation of the question would blow
up in the face of Republicans. ``The answer is that we won't if our
standards have sunk to a new low, if we have substandard schools,
if taxes are higher and regulations grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, of course, is aggressively laying out the case for why he,
along with Clinton, should be rewarded for the current combination
of steady growth, low unemployment, dormant inflation and a stock
market that will not quit. Democratic strategists say the economy _
assuming it remains on track _ is one issue on which Gore should be
all but invulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much of an opening for Republicans on the
economy,'' said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster. ``The
Republicans are in a position of me too-ism, and having to promise
not to rock the ship.''
</P>
<P>
   History gives the Republicans little hope.
</P>
<P>
   In the 13 president elections since World War II, there have
been four cases where an incumbent president or a vice president
running to succeed him suffered through recessions that extended to
within less than two years of election day. In every case _ Richard
M. Nixon in 1960, Gerald R. Ford in 1976, Carter in 1980 and
President George Bush in 1992 _ the challenger won.
</P>
<P>
   (Nixon and Reagan cut the rule close in their re-election
campaigns. Nixon presided over an 11-month recession that ended in
November 1970, but went on to a landslide victory in 1972. Reagan
presided over a 16-month recession that ended in November 1982, and
went on to a landslide victory in 1984.)
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, incumbent presidents or vice presidents
running to succeed them have won six of the seven elections since
World War II in which they have been able to claim stewardship of a
growing economy. The exception was Vice President Hubert Humphrey
in his race against Nixon in 1968, when the Vietnam War
overshadowed all other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Cast in the role of challenger _ much like Michael Dukakis for
the Democrats against his father in 1988 _ George W. Bush is
clearly looking for a way to turn the situation to his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   His slogan, ``Prosperity with a Purpose,'' hints at a strategy
of acknowledging the obvious and looking to use it both to advance
traditional Republican goals like lower taxes and as a basis for
his advocacy of ``compassionate'' conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of prosperity is to leave no one out, to leave no
one behind,'' Bush said in announcing his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said prosperity ``is not a given,'' was not invented by
Clinton and Gore ``any more than they created the Internet,'' and
that policies he supports, like tax cuts, restrictions on lawsuits,
free trade and partially privatizing Social Security, would help
keep the good times keep rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has developed an economic program that will be
good for the country whether the current cyclical upswing continues
or the economy falters,'' said Michael Boskin, a Stanford
University economist who was President Bush's chief economist and
is now advising George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the economy softens notably, which is possible but not the
base case, that will hurt Gore,'' Boskin said. ``Most likely the
economy and economic policy and what presidents do about it will be
a plus for Bush because his view is closer to where most voters
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole's advisers say that to the degree that voters feel
economically secure their interests will turn to other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's got big problems, and the irony is that the strong
economy is one of them because it's making people decide who to
vote for on the basis of character and personality,'' said Ari
Fleischer, Mrs. Dole's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said the real credit for the strong economy should go to
President Reagan, for cutting taxes and checking the growth in the
size and influence of the federal government. With the basics taken
care of for most people, he said, now is the time for consideration
of more far-reaching changes, like simplifying the tax code and
giving parents more choice in where their children go to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can say, OK, I have a job or the prospect of a job,''
Forbes said in an interview. ``But what is the quality of life? Why
can't two incomes do the job that one income used to do? Why can't
we spend more time with the kids? Why are our schools lagging those
of other countries?''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Republican candidates find it easier to draw
distinctions with Gore than with each other on economic policy. The
exception is Buchanan, whose message of gloom could become more
appealing to the front runner, Bush, should the economy turn down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Factories leaving, communities uprooted, high-paying jobs for
the middle class leaving the country,'' Buchanan said. ``Economic
insecurity has become a pre-existing condition of the American
middle class.''

SOME SEE US DOLLAR DOMINATING IN CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Will the queen be forced to abdicate her spot on
Canada's dollar in favor of that old revolutionary rascal George
Washington?
</P>
<P>
   Perish the thought, say Canadian nationalists, fearful their
country's separate cultural and economic identity is already being
squashed under the bigfoot neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   But some prominent economists in Canada are arguing that a
monetary union with the United States is not only likely, but
inevitable, as national economies go global. They predict the
Canadian dollar will follow the beaver pelt and Hudson's Bay
blanket into oblivion as a North American currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US dollar is the most powerful in the world, and one way
or another Canada is going to have to tie to it,'' said Thomas
Courchene, professor of economics at Queen's University in Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ``The march of events elsewhere in the Americas is moving toward
dollarization, using the US dollar as legal tender,'' he said,
referring to Argentina and other Latin American countries giving
consideration to adopting the greenback as their own.
</P>
<P>
   Canada is a rich nation, but in recent years its dollar has
exhibited the sort of instability usually associated with Third
World currencies, dropping to historic lows against the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Now the idea being floated by a few prominent Canadian
economists _ possibly at the tacit urging of Canadian federal
leaders _ is that North America must rally under a common currency
in order to compete against the euro, which is becoming the
monetary standard of an economically integrated Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But the suggestion that Canada should surrender control over its
monetary policy, assuming the US is even interested, is appalling
to many Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big business wants a single dollar and no border,'' said Maude
Barlow, chairwoman of the nationalist Council of Canadians, saying
her country is already too Americanized. ``This would be one more
step toward sacrificing our cultural and political autonomy for
greater integration with the US.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue threatens to ignite the sort of bitter controversy
that divided Canada 10 years ago, when politicians and Canadian
corporate honchos propelled the country into a pact with the US
that would become the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as then, the clamor in Canada has barely registered in the
US, where relations with Mexico are a touchy public issue while
relations with the supposedly ``just-like-us'' northern neighbor
rarely elicit more than yawns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a non-issue in the US,'' said Chris Sands, Canada
Project Director for the Washington-based Center for Strategic and
International Studies. ``Americans tend not to think much about
where the US-Canada relationship is going . . . while Canadians are
always thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Top Canadian federal Cabinet officials are pooh-pooing the
notion of a unified currency, even as they prepare to huddle in a
special meeting next week that will focus on the country's
extraordinarily close economic ties with the US, as well as the
often tortured political ties.
</P>
<P>
   A common currency, said Finance Minister Paul Martin, ``would
not be a good thing for the Canadian economy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the official line, and for good reason: Martin and other
top leaders must run for office, and open support for any move that
smacks of yielding even a smidgen of Canadian sovereignty to the
Yanks is surefire political suicide.
</P>
<P>
   But the Liberal Party government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien
has a reputation for loudly resisting the US embrace while quietly
snuggling ever closer to Washington. For example, Chretien was
elected partly on a pledge to oppose free trade with the US. But
one of his first acts was to join NAFTA, and his government now
champions greater trade integration.
</P>
<P>
   Given that history, the new talk of a common currency seems to
have the fuzzy markings of a trial balloon floated by Canada's
power elite.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was barely a murmur last month, but suddenly, it's all
the buzz. It tops the nightly news on CBC televison and has been
the subject of lengthy articles and commentary in leading
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper released this week, the C.D. Howe Institute, a think
tank whose forecasts often become the official line, urged Ottawa
to open negotiations with the US toward creation of a North
American Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
   Such a union, argued economists Courchene and Richard Harris of
British Columbia's Simon Fraser University, would eliminate the
floating US-Canada exchange rate in favor of a monetary system
controlled by a new central bank in which Canada would hold one of
13 seats, with the rest going to US regions.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the scheme say world economic trends make such a
pact inevitable. ``Currencies are becoming supranational. . . there
will be very few of them left in the world,'' Courchene told the
Toronto-based Globe and Mail newspaper. ``You go through Europe
five years from now, and there will be no small, independent
currencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The big question, of course, is whether the US would ever allow
Canada even a tiny voice in setting US monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's position is that it's okay for other countries to
adopt the American dollar as their currency, but the US is
uninterested in entering any European-style monetary union. The
Clinton administration says there has been no talk of a special
deal for Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had any official discussions between our two
governments about a unified currency,'' said State Department
spokesman James Rubin.

PRIME MINISTERS SEEK COMPROMISE TO PRESERVE IRISH PEACE PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish
counterpart, Bertie Ahern, came here Friday with what they said was
their final offer of a compromise to save the Good Friday Agreement
of 1998 from collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The two prime ministers, whose success in fashioning a political
settlement last year has brought relative peace to Northern Ireland
for the first time in 30 years, met with the various parties here
in an effort to end a stalemate that has stalled the creation of a
power-sharing local government.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings took place at Castle Buildings, the place where
last year's Good Friday Agreement was forged, producing a
settlement that is supposed to end three decades of political and
sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders are working against a deadline of Wednesday, set
by Blair because he believes the parties here will avoid making a
decision unless they are forced.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists, who represent middle-class Protestants who
want to remain British subjects, refuse to sit in a government with
Sinn Fein, the political representatives of the Irish Republican
Army, until the IRA begins to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   But the IRA has refused to turn in any weapons, saying that
would amount to a surrender it did not make, and Sinn Fein says
there is nothing in the Good Friday Agreement that links disarming
the IRA to Sinn Fein's participation in a government.
</P>
<P>
   Blair and Ahern arrived Friday with a proposal that was
relatively simple. Under their plan, Sinn Fein would be allowed
into the government, but it would be expected to sign a commitment
to have the IRA decommission its weapons on a strict timetable. If
those timetables are not met, Sinn Fein would be thrown out of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   British and Irish officials said the proposal calls for
compromise from both sides and upholds both the spirit and the
letter of the Good Friday Agreement, which did not link
decomissioning to participation in the government but was supposed
to be completed by May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has flatly said it will not turn in its weapons, and
Unionist leader David Trimble Friday was still insisting that his
party, the biggest in Northern Ireland, will not join a government
with Sinn Fein until after the IRA turns in weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Blair and Ahern described Friday's meetings with the
parties as preliminary, and said that the real negotiations will
begin Monday. However, one Irish official said ``the only thing to
be negotiated is the timetables'' of decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
   If the deadline passes without agreement, it is likely that the
Northern Ireland assembly, which was to bring Catholic nationalists
and Protestant unionists into a power-sharing cabinet for the first
time, will be suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Blair has said that if compromise is not reached by Wednesday,
there could be renewed violence in Northern Ireland. The timing,
meanwhile, could not be worse, as Northern Ireland's volatile
``marching season'' of Protestant parades will peak over the next
two weeks, with several contentious parades planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again we stare into the abyss. Somehow we must pull
back,'' Blair wrote in a guest column in The Times of London
Friday.

THE GLORY AND GAMBLE OF CREATING AN INDEX  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lately, it seems, media outlets everywhere _ from trade
publications to glossy magazines to Internet sites _ have been
turning out stock indexes at a rapid clip.
</P>
<P>
   Wired magazine publishes its own index of technology stocks,
while Advertising Age does the same with a basket of advertising
agency, media and other stocks. And Business Insurance, a trade
publication, has its index of insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of branding,'' said Steven A. Schoenfeld, head of
international equity strategies at Barclays Global Investors. Some
of the indexes, he added, ``are clearly a public relations
exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   While creating and maintaining these performance measures is
much easier than it used to be _ computers make it an automated
snap _ there are no guarantees that anyone will use them, or that
they will last.
</P>
<P>
   As Exhibit A, consider the fate of the New York Times stock and
bond indexes.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times indexes? Indeed. For 62 years, beginning in
1911, The Times published daily stock indexes of 25 industrial and
25 transportation stocks (called railroad stocks back then), a
composite index of the 50 stocks and a bond index.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the indexes were used by The Times and others _
including John Kenneth Galbraith, who, in his 1954 book ``The Great
Crash of 1929,'' described them as ``somewhat more accessible to
the nonprofessional observer than the Dow Jones averages.''
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1970s, though, the Times indexes were largely
ignored; even The Times' own reporters referred exclusively to the
Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Robards, then The Times' market reporter and now the owner
of a wine shop in Lake Placid, N.Y., said he used the Dow
industrials because that was what most people cared about. ``I was
reporting what everybody else reported on _ on the radio, on TV, in
The Wall Street Journal,'' he said. ``I was writing what my
instincts told me to write about.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Wall Street analysts followed the Times indexes, Robards
said, because they were broader than the Dow Jones indexes and the
analysts thought that made the Times indexes better. But that view
was clearly in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   When The Times stopped publishing the indexes in June 1973,
during a big bear market, ``there wasn't any need for them,''
Robards said, adding that he did not recall any complaints. (The
notice in the paper said only that the indexes had been
discontinued.)
</P>
<P>
   Given the obstacles to establishing a credible index, what,
besides brand development _ and a touch of vanity _ is behind the
index proliferation among media outlets these days?
</P>
<P>
   There isthe slight chance that an index can make money. Morgan
Stanley Capital International, which calculates more than 6,000
indexes a day, gets about $250,000 a year from each company
licensing the indexes as well as a fee from exchanges and broker
dealers for each derivatives trade based on the indexes, said
Suzanne Crosby, director of global marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the company is just breaking even, she said. Standard &AMP;
Poor's, with some of the most widely followed indexes, takes in
about $20 million a year from licensing, according to industry
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Times indexes, Nancy Nielsen, a company spokeswoman,
said the newspaper had no plans to revive them anytime soon.

EGO PREVENTS OPPOSITION FROM SEIZING POWER AS MILOSEVIC FALTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ For opposition politicians in Yugoslavia,
this should be the showtime.
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic has lost his fourth war in a row
and surrendered the sacred Serbian homeland of Kosovo to heavily
armed foreigners. He has been indicted as a war criminal, the Swiss
are swooping down to close any bank accounts he might have and the
United States has offered $5 million to anyone who helps nab him. A
third of Yugoslavia is out of work, incomes are down 40 percent
this year and, according to a credible poll by a private firm this
week, 70 percent of Serbs blame Milosevic for the whole sorry mess.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as has been the case for nearly a decade, the opposition
seems incapable of seizing the day. United in their eagerness to
dump a dictator and end Serbia's isolation as an international
pariah, opposition leaders remain hobbled by their competing egos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Milosevic could not choose a better opposition because, if
it repeats its unforgivable mistakes, he will be in power
forever,'' grumbled Slobodan Vuksanovic, vice-president of the
Democratic Party, one of a cluster of pro-Western parties here.
``We have an ego problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A in the disunity of the Serbian opposition and the
primacy of ego is Vuk Draskovic, the only opposition figure with a
sizable national following, his own television station and the
populist razzle-dazzle to lure large numbers of Serbs out into the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic's haughty disdain for a fractured opposition movement
that desperately needs his charisma, his television station and his
political machine helps explain why democracy in Serbia has been so
much more elusive than in the rest of post-Communist Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Tall, bearded and prone to self-dramatizing soliloquy,
Draskovic, 52, a former best-selling novelist of blood-soaked
nationalist novels, is not humble about his political gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the king of the streets,'' Draskovic said in an interview
Friday at the headquarters of his Serbian Renewal Party. ``I know
better than anyone in the world what could be the real moment for
demonstrations to bring down Milosevic. This is not the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of nearly every other opposition party in Yugoslavia
disagree on the question of timing. They have joined an umbrella
group called Alliance for Change and announced that next Tuesday
they will begin mass protests around Serbia to demand that
Milosevic resign and that free elections be held under the
supervision of European monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must harness the anger of the Serbian people,'' said Vladan
Batic, coordinator of the alliance. ``After Kosovo, everything is
different. People finally understand that political changes are
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, who also senses that the loss of Kosovo will prove to
be a mortal blow to the Milosevic regime, said he wishes the
alliance a lot of luck, but he does not feel like hanging out with
``small political parties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not ready to waste time in closed rooms discussing stupid
things,'' Draskovic said.
</P>
<P>
   As much as other opposition leaders may resent Draskovic's
uppity tone, they tend to agree that without him and his party,
which has been able to turn out tens of thousands of protesters
against the Milosevic regime for weeks on end, it will be difficult
to sustain pressure on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vuk won't call us, and we don't want to call him, and
Milosevic is rubbing his hands together in delight,'' conceded
Vuksanovic, a prominent leader in the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic's hubris is the result of strong recent poll numbers
for his party, his surprisingly successful cameo performance as a
government minister during the 10-week Kosovo war and a new
go-it-alone strategy cooked up by his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Those advisers say that Draskovic was betrayed by other
opposition leaders in 1996-97, when he helped lead three months of
protest rallies in Belgrade that came tantalizingly close to
toppling the Milosevic regime. They vow he will not be duped again.
</P>
<P>
   During the last big round of protests, Draskovic complained that
he was undermined by Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the Democratic
Party and the other big fish in the opposition sea. In the fall of
1997, Djindjic encouraged opposition parties to boycott an election
when Draskovic ran for president of Serbia. The boycott contributed
to Draskovic's dismal third-place showing in the vote.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Never again will he trust Djindjic or other ``very selfish''
opposition leaders, Draskovic said Friday, as he painted a dark
scenario of what he believes would happen if he were to participate
in a pre-election opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immediately before elections, they will start to quarrel, to
accuse each other, to blackmail each other, and Milosevic would see
a way to manipulate them,'' said Draskovic. ``He would use smoke,
coffee, whiskey and be very, very satisfied by the stupid ambitions
of the opposition. No. I am not a part of it. I tried for nine
years to unify them without any success. OK. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A poll last week suggests that, in the aftermath of the Kosovo
war, Draskovic can afford some petulance. His party's popularity
rose smartly during the conflict, from about 7 percent in March to
about 15 percent this week, according to a nationwide poll by
Medium, a private polling firm. The poll, which other politicians
here say is credible, places Draskovic's party behind only the
ruling Socialist People's Party, whose popularity slid during the
war to from 29 to 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, who has been severely beaten and imprisoned in
anti-Milosevic protests this decade, stunned many in Serbia in
January when he accepted the Serb leader's invitation to join the
Yugoslav government as a deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, he attracted considerable attention here and
around the world by condemning the NATO bombing of civilian targets
in Serbia as brutal and inhuman. At the same time, he demanded that
the foreign press be allowed to operate inside Serbia and distanced
himself from Milosevic, accusing his government of lying to the
Serb people about who was winning the war in Kosovo. In late April,
he was fired by the regime, but not before he had shown himself off
to many Serbs as a strongly nationalist, yet sane alternative to
Milosevic's policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prevented many stupid things from happening during the
war,'' Draskovic boasted. `` risked my life. I did my obligations.
I did it by staying in Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic noted that his opposition rival, Djindjic, did not
have the courage to remain. Citing threats to his life, Djindjic
fled Serbia in May and has yet to return. His absence, which has
been criticized as cowardly, even by members of his own party, has
hurt the Democratic Party's fortunes. Djindjic is expected to
return to Serbia next week for the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many of his critics here believe the real reason Draskovic is
reluctant to take on the Milosevic regime is that he does not want
to lose his political trump card, Studio B television. The station,
a real alternative to state-controlled TV, is controlled by
Belgrade city hall, which is run by a coalition of Draskovic's
party and the ruling Socialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Vuk pushes too hard, he could lose the support of the
Socialists,'' said one analyst here who did not want to be
identified by name. ``He could lose Studio B, and then he would be
in the same position as everybody else in the opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about this, Draskovic was indignant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a total lie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most vexing complication in the political evolution
of Draskovic is what exactly he believes in. He has been a somewhat
promiscuous populist over the past decade, alternating between
fist-pounding nationalism and sophisticated sensitivity to the
rights of ethnic minorities. In the early 1990s, he liked to draw
maps showing how big a Greater Serbia should be. He often seemed
unsure of whether Milosevic had erred by starting wars or losing
them.
</P>
<P>
   As with many politicians in Serbia, it is difficult to discern
how much nationalism colors his commitment to democracy and human
rights. Asked about this, Draskovic said there is no confusion at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``My nationalism was always healthy, Western nationalism,'' he
said.

WORKHORSE UTILITIES GET ANOTHER LOOK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world is often a strange place, but the marketplace is
supposed to be rational.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, then, the counterintuitive move in utility stocks,
which because of their high dividend yields and low growth rates
are often seen as bonds dressed up as equities.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few months, bond prices have fallen like a stone,
and interest rates have shot up. Yet, since the end of March, the
Standard &AMP; Poor's Utilities index has risen by 12.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, that sort of move doesn't make a lot of sense.
Rising interest rates should make bonds more competitive with
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Are utilities still a good proxy for bonds? What is going on in
this $300 billion industry? Steven I. Flieshman, an electric
utility analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., took some time last week to
discuss these and other issues. Here are some excerpts: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Isn't it unusual for utility stocks to do well in a
period of rising interest rates?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, the group as a whole is still down for the year, so
it's not like we are doing great. And until two or three months
ago, the electric utility index had acted pretty much in tandem
with the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   We were somewhat surprised that happened because deregulation is
changing the industry and fewer companies are paying high
dividends. So I am not surprised there has been some delinkage. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Is that to say there are no ties between utilities
and bonds?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Utility stocks can often be a leading indicator of where the
bond market will go.
</P>
<P>
   We look at the spread between the 30-year Treasury bond yield
and the 55 utility stocks we follow. Historically, that spread has
averaged between 50 basis points and 60 basis points. Currently,
the spread is about 130 basis points, which is as high as it has
been since late 1994. So you could speculate that bond yields may
have risen too much. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Market rates have been rising because of
expectations that the Federal Reserve is going to raise short-term
rates. Why are rising rates good for utility stocks?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. As a group, since the mid-1980s, utilities tend to perform
worst after periods when the Fed eases rates and best in the months
ahead of Fed tightenings.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, as the Fed starts to tighten, the desired
outcome is to slow the economy, which makes growth sectors like
technology less attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in times of higher interest rates, it is better to own
shorter-duration securities than longer-duration ones. In that
environment, higher-yielding utilities are a better performing
asset than a growth stock. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Speaking of growth, hasn't deregulation prompted a
number of utilities to look beyond their original markets?(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The industry is splitting.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are exiting the power generation part of the
business, which is the part that is turning very competitive, and
are just focusing on distribution, which remains regulated.
</P>
<P>
   The distribution companies are lower-risk, and more predictable.
Consolidated Edison is a company that sold off most of its power
generation and is focusing on distribution. It is one of the few
big companies that is going in that direction, and it is a pretty
low-risk, unsexy sort of investment.
</P>
<P>
   The second group is focusing on the competitive power generation
and related businesses, like marketing the power to both the
wholesale and retail buyer. The focus of these companies is clearly
to boost their growth rates. The split between these two groups has
accelerated over the last year. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Are there stocks you like in both camps?(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. On the growth side, we like companies like Duke Energy, Peco
Energy and Texas Utilities. Part of the Peco and Texas Utilities
stories is restructuring, which is happening as deregulation occurs
in their states. My price target for Duke is the mid-60s, and the
low 50s for Texas Utilities. (The stocks closed on Friday at
$55.5625 and $42.4375, respectively.)
</P>
<P>
   On the distribution side, Sierra Pacific Resources and Nevada
Power are merging, a deal which should close in late July. Because
they are in the nation's highest customer-growth state in terms of
electricity sales, they are good bets.
</P>
<P>
   Another category we are looking at is telecommunications. A lot
of utilities had fiber in the ground themselves, and many have
rights of way that allow them to put it in the ground. They are not
huge competitors to the regional Bells, but, over time, if the
values of the telecommunication franchise don't get brought out in
the price of the utility stock, these telecom properties will be
spun out.
</P>
<P>
   The big story in this area is Montana Power, whose stock price
has about tripled. But I rate it ``accumulate'' with a price target
of $80. A stock we still like is Connectiv Inc., with a target of
$29. (Montana Power and Connectiv closed on Friday at $70 and
$25.1875, respectively.) &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In mid-May, James E. Oesterreicher, chief executive of the J.C.
Penney Co., stood before shareholders at the annual meeting and
predicted that prosperity was just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Though earnings had been stagnant and stock performance
disappointing since Oesterreicher took the helm four years ago, he
had a plan: $300 million for store remodeling, $75 million for a
huge push onto the Internet, and a further emphasis on in-house
brands. By the fall, he promised, these initiatives would add up to
significant gains in sales.
</P>
<P>
   These pronouncements, combined with news that Penney was raising
cash by selling the public 20 percent of Eckerd, its fast-growing
drugstore chain, were enough to convince Wall Street analysts that
a turnaround was near. Attitudes toward the company's shares moved
from a hold toward a thumbs-up buy, according to the First Call
Corp., which tracks analyst ratings. Penney's stock shot up 10
percent after the announcement about Eckerd and has hovered around
the new plateau ever since.
</P>
<P>
   But many former employees and other industry experts think Wall
Street's optimism is premature. Penney's stock may be undervalued
because of Eckerd's strong performance, they say. But the core of
the business _ the nearly century-old retail chain, which accounts
for roughly 50 percent of annual revenues _ is as troubled as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``To renovate a store is not enough,'' said Kurt Barnard,
president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report. ``You have to have
focus, and Penney's has a total, utter lack of focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Oesterreicher is seen by his critics as something of
a Herbert Hoover, proposing modest corrections even in the face of
a deepening crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to believe they can fix it as it is,'' said one
frustrated former vice president, ``as if just by staying the
course, everything will be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind Penney's many shortcomings lurks one overarching problem:
more and better competition. For decades, Penney prospered by
serving a large but unglamorous audience. More affordable than
department stores like Bloomingdale's and Macy's, but more
up-market than discounters, Penney was a respectable, if never
particularly stylish, home for the budget-conscious shopper.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two decades, however, this segment of the retailing
market has gone through a sea change. Department stores have
slashed prices, making an obvious play for mass instead of class.
Meanwhile, retailers like Target and Old Navy are stealing
customers with cut-rate prices and hip environs to boot. It is
impossible to imagine Donna Summer's disco hit Hot Stuff, now a
retro classic, blaring over Penney's speaker system the way it
rocks at Old Navy outposts.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Penney has tried various tactics for
repositioning itself. In the early 1980s, the company evolved in a
more upscale direction, signing leases to be anchor stores in
fancier malls. Soon after, it stopped selling hard goods _ the
appliances and tools that are, by contrast, the mainstay of Sears'
business _ so it could concentrate on apparel and home furnishings.
In 1988, it introduced a series of private brands, most notably the
Arizona Jeans Company.
</P>
<P>
   At each juncture, Penney's moves were considered shrewd and
forward-looking. Some have been highly successful: Arizona Jeans,
for example, became a billion-dollar brand last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it has not been enough. For two years now Penney's sales
in stores opened at least a year (a standard industry measurement
of health) have increased less than 2 percent while the industry in
general has experienced robust growth. New competitors like Old
Navy chalked up double-digit gains over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Oesterreicher acknowledges that the recent performance of his
Penny stores has not been what it should be, but blames ``dramatic
process changes,'' which he says will result in marked improvements
in the near future. No. 1 on this list is a culture-altering move
to wrench control of apparel buying from individual store managers
and hand it over to central buyers.
</P>
<P>
   As late as 1997, individual Penney's store managers bought over
90 percent of what went onto their shelves. By contrast, at almost
every other major retailer, from Sears to Bloomingdale's, buying is
now done centrally. In theory such an arrangement allowed Penney
managers to personalize inventories to suit their customers. In
practice, it meant that store managers, with an eye toward last
year's successes, purchased too little of the next season's hot
item, like capri pants, because it seemed foreign.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we ordered the latest fashions, our competitors
already had them in stock,'' Oesterreicher said. To correct this,
he has phased in a system where central buyers purchase the first
round of clothes each season, while store buyers retain the right
to reorder.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes Oesterreicher says will yield results soon are a
new marketing strategy that will focus on spotlighting Penney's
private brands instead of just announcing sales events, a major
renovation budget to lighten and brighten stores, and a decision to
cull many underperforming lines of clothing from the stores.
</P>
<P>
   But some former employees and analysts counter that such changes
are not nearly radical enough to save Penney's in the long run.
Similar sweeping marketing and merchandising changes have usually
yielded temporary gains at Kmart and Sears, and even at Penney
before, only to stall again soon after.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turning around old retailers that have not kept pace with new
forms of competition and have repeatedly disappointed customers has
proven to be very difficult historically,'' said Richard Church, an
analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. ``It requires bold aggressive
moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Even there, Penney's seems behind its traditional competitors.
Kmart, for example, appears to have carved out a stronger image for
itself through its Martha Stewart line of home furnishings and its
ads featuring Rosie O'Donnell and Penny Marshall. But asked to
describe Penney's positioning for the future, Oesterreicher harks
back to the classic mid-market department store of the past: ``We
will offer more breadth in assortment and sizes and more
convenience, in terms of location, than other retailers.''
</P>
<P>
   That hardly speaks to a vision for a particular customer. ``The
time when you could be everything to everyone ended 35 years ago,''
Barnard said.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Penney has been an American institution for almost a
century. That is its strength _ and its weakness. Decades of
shopping at stores with aging physical plants, outdated locations,
merchandise in disarray and ho-hum styles has left many consumers
with a distinct aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   Even Penney's most devoted customers do not describe it as
fashionable. Michelle Mitchell is a perfect example of this
life-long Penney's shopper. ``They have the best children's
clothes,'' she gushes, ``and they are a lot less expensive than
Macy's.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Mitchell, a casually chic Queens, N.Y., native,
admits that while Penney's clothes meet the sartorial needs of
kindergartners, she does not wear them herself. When it comes to
buying work clothes, she shops the much pricier specialty chain Ann
Taylor's. ``Quality is not the issue,'' she explains, ``it's the
styling.''
</P>
<P>
   To alter such deep-bred customer perceptions would require a
feat of Herculean proportions, but Penney's, with a notoriously
insular corporate culture, is averse to itinerant, superhero types.
Of the company's top managers above the senior vice president
level, only two have not spent their entire careers there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The norm is to be there your whole career, several are even
second generation,'' said Lucille Klein, who left as fashion
director of Penney's women's division three years ago, but still
consults with the company. ``It leads to tunnel vision, like the
Penney's way of doing things is the only way.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A 35-year veteran himself, Oesterreicher does not see this as a
problem, however. ``I don't think whether people come from the
inside or the outside is important,'' he said. ``The issue is
getting the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Penney's most intriguing effort to alter its trajectory has been
a recent push to set itself up as a pre-eminent Internet retailer.
``We plan to be the biggest retailer of apparel on the Web by
2001,'' said George Stasick, vice president of Internet operations,
confirming the announcement his boss made to the annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Penney comes to this table with real advantages. For one, with
$4 billion in sales, Penney is the largest cataloger in North
America. It has in place the capacity to ship 65 percent of its
product within 48 hours and the rest within 72 hours.
Catalog-service desks take returns at all 1,200 J.C. Penney stores
as well as at 300 Eckerd's stores. Five hundred more Eckerd's
locations are planned in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   But if Penney's raw promise is unmatched in the business, its
strategy for implementation seems less invincible. A week after
announcing that it would spend $75 million just on advertising the
Internet initiative, the company was backtracking. ``We all heard
them say that,'' said Theda Page Whitehead, a company spokeswoman,
``but they say they didn't say it.''
</P>
<P>
   The real strategy, as it turns out, is to spend the $75 million
on catalog advertising, with the Internet side piggy-backing on
that by adding Penney's Web address prominently in ads and signs.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this media play, Penney's faces a fundamental challenge
that many of its moderate income customers do not even have a home
Internet connection yet. Its special cyberspace hook is to focus on
large and tall sizes not commonly available. At its Just4me site,
(www.just4meplus.com) heavier women can design models shaped like
themselves to try on outfits. But Penney is far from alone in
selling clothes to oversized women. Lane Bryant, a division of The
Limited that also specializes in plus sizes, has a much sassier
(albeit more cumbersome) site.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the other giants of middle-America retailing have big
plans for the Internet, too. Earlier this month, Sears, Roebuck
announced a multimillion dollar push to advertise its decision to
sell appliances online. Brian Kelley, Sears' vice president for
online marketing, said the move was part of a strategy to exploit
its strengths. Sears sells about a third of all appliances in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to take advantage of historic dominance in this
area, then engage the consumer in other categories,'' Kelley said.
</P>
<P>
   At its annual meeting, Wal-Mart Stores, while vague about its
plans, promised a major push on the Web this year, too. One analyst
estimates the company has spent $100 million to relaunch its
existing Internet site later this year.
</P>
<P>
   So what can Penney's do to keep up?
</P>
<P>
   The former vice president says that at one point management
toyed with taking the experimental stores in Dallas and turning
them into an entirely different concept. The idea was rejected, she
said, but it may still have merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``To succeed,'' the former executive said, ``they really just
need to get away from the Penney's name.''

CORRECTS NUMBER OF OMNIPOINT SUBSCRIBERS/CUSTOMERS TO 550,000  
 VOICESTREAM, OMNIPOINT FOUND A FIT IN EACH OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When you're a small cellular service provider using
the least popular technology in America, just trying harder may not
be good enough.
</P>
<P>
   So John Stanton, chairman and chief executive of Bellevue's
VoiceStream Wireless Corp., and Doug Smith, his counterpart at
Omnipoint Corp. of Bethesda, Md., decided to join forces. Wednesday
night they created a merged entity with assets of $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, already approved by the boards and shareholders of
both companies, creates the second largest PCS (digital cellular
service) license holder in the nation and the fourth largest in
terms of people within the licensed areas, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   It will hold licenses to serve more than 175 million people
across the country, in 17 of the top 25 markets.
</P>
<P>
   The merger ``creates some massive scale for the company,'' said
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst Jeffrey Hines.
</P>
<P>
   Before the merger, at opposite ends of the country, both
companies had been independently building cellular networks based
on GSM, a cellular technology far more popular in Asia and Europe
than in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   VoiceStream started building its GSM network in the west and
midwest. It currently serves 450,000 customers in 11 markets within
13 western states. Service areas include Denver, Phoenix, Portland,
Salt Lake City and Seattle. Dallas and Chicago are next.
</P>
<P>
   Omnipoint serves the Northeast and Midwest, with nearly 550,000
customers in Boston, Detroit, Miami, New York and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, cellular giant AT&AMP;T Wireless Services uses a
competing technology _ time division multiple access, or TDMA _
while mega-provider Sprint PCS uses code division multiple access,
or CDMA. Most customers don't know or care about the difference,
but it matters to the providers, because the three systems are
incompatible. Building a nationwide system around one of the
systems requires a massive investment in FCC licenses, cellular
relay towers, and other hardware.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is either to make a massive investment or find a
partner.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton and Smith, aided by a team of nearly 25 people, pursued
the latter course, launching the new company on Wednesday in the
offices of a New York law firm. The new company, which will retain
the VoiceStream Wireless name, will challenge the big guys, execs
say.
</P>
<P>
   The objective: to acquire the size and scope to provide
customers with a nationwide network for local, long distance and
data.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the GSM providers, who are a series of independent
companies, don't have is the ability to offer nationwide rate
plans,'' said Don Guthrie, VoiceStream's vice chairman and
director. ``I'd be very surprised if we don't have a nationwide
plan by the end of next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton in prepared remarks said the merged company will be
better positioned than either company alone to offer service to
major customers like large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will let VoiceStream save costs by
combining functions like billing and customer service, analysts
said. It will also reduce what VoiceStream pays other carriers to
serve its customers when they travel around the country.
</P>
<P>
   To finance its expansion, VoiceStream got additional cash from
Cook Inlet Region Inc., an Anchorage corporation with investments
in communications, tourism and real estate. That company invested
an undisclosed amount to form joint ventures to acquire licenses
from Omnipoint.
</P>
<P>
   In the third piece of Wednesday's deal, Hutchison
Telecommunications PCS (USA) Ltd., which already held 24 percent of
VoiceStream's stock, said it will invest another $957 million in
the combined company, including $150 million of preferred Omnipoint
stock. The investment will give Hutchison, whose parent company is
based in Hong Kong, approximately a 30 percent share of the
combined company.
</P>
<P>
   VoiceStream will exchange 0.825 shares of its common stock, plus
$8 in cash, for each share of Omnipoint common stock. The merger is
set to close in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory approvals.
</P>
<P>
   The next step for the new company is to ``start rolling up the
other GSM players,'' said Paul Judge, director of The Walter Group,
a Seattle telecommunications consulting and development company.
``John Stanton is a strong horse, and the financial community loves
him. Wall Street was looking for the horse to roll up all the GSM
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton _ by most accounts the main force behind the merger _
will remain the chairman and chief executive of VoiceStream.
</P>
<P>
   Smith will become a vice-chairman of VoiceStream, leading the
development of a wireless data strategy for the new company. The
Omnipoint name will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Those two ``have talked weekly for three years now, and it was
probably in the back of their minds five years ago,'' he said. He
couldn't say when talks first became serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys are entrepreneurs,'' Guthrie said. ``They have the
force, vitality, energy to drive an idea forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Other VoiceStream execs took on varied roles during the
negotiations, which Guthrie, an experienced financier, described as
extremely complex. His role was to coordinate Voice-Stream's and
Omnipoint's legal teams. Cregg Baumbaugh, VoiceStream's executive
vice president for finance, strategy and development, was the chief
negotiator with Cook. Alan Bender, general counsel, spent about
forty hours straight with his Omnipoint counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a day off qualifies as less than four hours, I think I had
one over the past two weeks, but I'm not sure when,'' he said.

COURIER OUTMARATHONS SCHALKEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Jim Courier turned Wimbledon into Woodstock Friday as
he continued his recent habit of upstaging the English in their own
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Great Britain, which has been searching in vain for the next
great Briton since Fred Perry won the last of his three straight
Wimbledons in 1936, scheduled three native sons _ well, two natives
and one with an asterisk _ on its showpieces, Centre Court and No.
1, for the third round. Courier was consigned to No. 3, a lesser
forum befitting a 28-year-old player who hasn't won a major title
in six years and is ranked 61st on the ATP Tour, and whose
opponent, Sjeng Schalken, is rated a gaudy 50th.
</P>
<P>
   They proceeded to wage an epic confrontation that was almost as
time-consuming as ``Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' and certainly
as gripping. Courier, the gallant, prickly US veteran, faltered
often but absolutely refused to surrender as he outlasted Schalken,
7-6 (7-2), 3-6, 3-6, 7-5, 13-11.
</P>
<P>
   During the match's 4-hour-25-minute duration, Court 3, just
outside Centre Court, became the central court. No. 3 seats a mere
800, but the crowd increased exponentially as the drama did. This
in spite of the fact that Britain's prime hope, sixth seed Tim
Henman, and its endearing oddity, Danny Sapsford, were on the major
stages _ Centre and No. 1, respectively _ at the same time.
Meanwhile, ninth seed Greg Rusedski, a Canadian by birth who used
the technicality of his mother's British heritage to switch tennis
allegiances, was waiting in the wings for the day's last match on
Centre Court.
</P>
<P>
   That came after No. 4 women's seed Monica Seles suffered yet
another disappointment in the only major whose championship has
eluded her. Seles, who has never regained her dominance since being
stabbed by a crazed German assailant during a 1993 match in
Hamburg, was eliminated by unseeded Mirjana Lucic, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6
(7-4), in the act between the British headliners on Centre Court.
``I think it's going to be very tough, obviously, to play like
(before the attack); time will tell,'' said Seles, whose exit aids
the cause of the top remaining women's seed, No. 2 Steffi Graf, a
6-1, 6-3 victor over Corina Morariu.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Seles, the British contingent performed as expected: two
wins, one loss. Henman ousted Lipton Championships winner Sebastien
Grosjean, 6-1, 6-7 (8-10), 6-3, 6-2, in the big house. Rusedski
entertained another capacity house of 13,813 with a 6-3, 6-4, 7-5
win over Magnus Norman. Doughboy Sapsford, the 30-year-old who is
to British tennis what Eddie ``the Eagle'' Edwards was to British
ski jumping, was ushered into retirement by top seed and defending
champion Pete Sampras, 6-3, 6-4, 7-5, in a match that began two
hours after Courier's and finished an hour before it. Thus ended
the indifferent career of Sapsford, who had promised before gaining
entry into Wimbledon as a qualifier that his next loss would be his
farewell and who prepared for the tournament by gardening at his
house for a week.
</P>
<P>
   But other than staunch loyalists, it seemed that everyone on the
grounds was flocking to Courier-Schalken, especially during the
24-game climax.
</P>
<P>
   The runways ringing Court 3 were stuffed five deep, and the
stairs to the main grounds _ officially off limits _ didn't have
room for one footstep.
</P>
<P>
   In a '90s version of the knothole gang, patrons scaled the wire
fence behind the green facade at one end of the court and tried to
peer through the geraniums atop the posts. Others standing on the
pavement, with absolutely no chance of seeing the action, massed
behind the walls, and some enterprising souls were hoisted atop
supporters' shoulders and delivered stroke-by-stroke accounts in
various languages before being hushed by security personnel.
</P>
<P>
   And for those in the main building that houses Centre Court, the
attraction across the way was no less compelling. People stood at
their office windows and along a public balcony viewing the
proceedings on 3. Even the staid, blue-blazered gents of the All
England Club took pause from their afternoon resfreshments,
stepping onto the balcony outside the players' tea room and placing
their white cups delicately on the railing as they watched,
spellbound.
</P>
<P>
   Courier has become worth all the attention. In April at
Birmingham, he outdueled Rusedski in a five-set classic that lifted
the US Davis Cup team over Britain and into the quarterfinals
against Australia July 16-18 in Brookline, Mass. And in his
second-round match here, his first on Centre Court in six years, he
made the wait worthwhile by bouncing 12th seed Carlos Moya in five
sets.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, weakened by a severe cold and the cumulative wear of so
many strenuous battles, he surpassed even his own dramatic
standards.
</P>
<P>
   After capturing the first set in a 7-2 tiebreaker, he looked
cooked in the midday sun.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth set, he faced match point at 4-5, advantage
Schalken, but kept breathing when the Dutchman hit a return long.
Then he broke serve to 6-5. Still in peril at 0-30 while serving
for the set, Courier again disinterred himself, forcing an extended
conclusion he didn't seem capable of surviving.
</P>
<P>
   Both players held serve through 8-8, but not before Courier had
survived another match point when he trailed, 5-6, 30-40. When
Schalken sent a return into the net, Courier exhaled in relief and
pumped his fist, which he continued doing after every successful
point.
</P>
<P>
   There were more histrionics from two demonstrative, drained
performers. Courier broke to 9-8, inspiring Schalken to hit a ball
in disgust toward the Members Enclosure four courts away, drawing a
warning. But Schalken had reason to celebrate when he broke right
back to 9-9. During a five-deuce game that tied the match at 10-10,
Courier gestured to the crowd to pump up the volume. And on they
battled, each holding serve through multi-deuce games until Courier
earned the advantage again at 12-11 when Schalken hit long.
</P>
<P>
   When Schalken finally yielded, volleying into the doubles alley
to lose a love game for the match, Courier pointed his racket at
the crowd, an imperial gesture of triumph. That was his last
exertion for the day; he required intravenous treatment because of
dehydration and declined to meet the press.
</P>
<P>
   But a devastated Schalken spoke on his behalf. ``He's a great
player, and it was a great match,'' said Schalken. ``He's always
fighting, and he had two incredible shots at the right time. It was
great for tennis, and I think that's why the queue is also long
here for these matches.''
</P>
<P>
   Henman, whom Courier beat in Birmingham and faces in the fourth
round Monday _ undoubtedly on Centre Court _ also put in a good
word for the stubborn American who refuses to go away. ``He seems
to pull through those matches,'' said Henman, ``and that's a sign
of a great player. He's a big-match player. I think when it's a
big-match occasion, he plays, you know _ that ranking is perhaps
lying a little bit.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27)  
 (af)  
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Imperial Credit Commercial Mortgage Investment Corp., a real
estate investment trust, has properties spread from a suburb of
Paris to sun-drenched Las Vegas, Nev. But its fate is likely to
hinge on what happened earlier this month in a conference room at a
Marriott hotel in Torrance, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   REIT's lost their stock market glitz in late 1997 and nearly
became a boneyard last fall when investors shunned their risks
after the Russian debt crisis. Since then, it has become
fashionable to insist that the field offers rich pickings for
individual investors looking for bargains.
</P>
<P>
   But when H. Wayne Snavely, chairman of Imperial Credit
Commercial Mortgage Investment, called a shareholder meeting to
order at the Torrance Marriott on June 18, value-happy individual
investors were scarce. Instead, he faced about a dozen financially
muscular portfolio managers, or their lawyers. Many were there to
protest the proposed acquisition of the trust by its publicly
traded management company, which is also run by Snavely.
</P>
<P>
   The management company, Imperial Credit Industries, has offered
to buy the trust for $11.50 a share, about 25 cents more than its
current trading price and $2.50 less than book value. The
institutional investors contend that the trust's assets could fetch
at least $13 share in a liquidation or in an auction that was not
tilted in favor of the management company.
</P>
<P>
   Snavely says the trust and its management company will cooperate
fully with any competing bidder _ as a shareholder, he said, he too
wants the best price for his shares _ but he disagrees that a
liquidation will produce anything like the bonus that his
institutional investors predict.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute shows the challenge for small investors these days
in the REIT market, where the best motto might be: REITs are for
professionals. Don't try this at home.
</P>
<P>
   While the market is filled with trust shares that look cheap by
historical standards, those that are also safe are much harder for
even professionals to find. By law, such trusts must pay out
virtually all their income to shareholders, even when it is more
prudent to retain capital.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is to find a trust whose portfolio can withstand
that steady outflow of cash without collapsing into debt or
excessively diluting the stakes of existing investors.
</P>
<P>
   And even if you find one, the industry is so beset by conflicts
of interest that you may need to speak up to protect your interests
_ and it is far easier to be heard when you own a million shares or
so.
</P>
<P>
   That is about the number of the Imperial trust's 28.5 million
outstanding shares that are owned by Third Avenue Funds, which is
run by Martin J. Whitman, a value investor who has never been shy
about speaking out.
</P>
<P>
   In late May, the trust's independent directors got a polite
letter from Michael H. Winer, co-manager of the Third Avenue Real
Estate Value fund. He urged the independent directors overseeing
the auction to reject the management company's bid and consider
instead ``an orderly liquidation'' of the trust's assets, arguing
that bidders are more likely to pay top dollar if they are bidding
only for assets they really want.
</P>
<P>
   And he questioned the size of the termination fee the management
company will get as part of the deal, which some analysts estimated
could be as much as $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Then he made his plans to spend June 18 in Torrance.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, Gary Frohman was packing his briefcase,
too. Frohman is a portfolio manager for the Alan J. Steinberg L.P.
in Coral Gables, Fla., a small investment partnership with about
300,000 of the trust's shares under management.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that the management company is trying to buy
the trust at a below-market price,'' Frohman said.
</P>
<P>
   Snavely, wearing his hat as trust chairman, said in an interview
that he ``appreciates the input of our investors'' but disagrees
that a liquidation is better than selling the trust intact.
</P>
<P>
   Then he donned his hat as the management company's chairman and
explained that the termination fee, which will be set by an
independent appraisal, has been capped voluntarily at $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   That is about five times the annual management fee and 10
percent of the market capitalization of the trust, an arrangement
Winer thought ``ludicrous''; Frohman considered it merely
``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the termination fee should be nailed down quickly,
Frohman said, because ``it will be difficult or impossible for a
third party to make their best bid without knowing what this
obligation will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The fee dispute shows how the management company's insider
status could discourage other bidders, several big shareholders
said. But Snavely said he was confident that adequate due diligence
by an outside bidder would keep the field level.
</P>
<P>
   The management company and its officers own about 12 percent of
the trust's shares, he pointed out, so ``if somebody wants to pay
more, we will appreciate it.'' But he is not optimistic, he said.

REFUGEES IGNORE DANGERS, FLOOD BACK INTO KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Despite the danger of land mines and an
escalating cycle of violence, an estimated 50,000 ethnic Albanian
refugees a day came pouring back to Kosovo for the last two days,
UN officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The movement of people, which a UN official called the largest
single ``spontaneous return'' of refugees in the last 25 years,
posed a grave challenge to international aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   A host of agencies are struggling to provide for the basic needs
of families and to identify and clear deadly land mines and
buildings booby-trapped by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   With lines up to five miles long at border crossings from
Albania, Macedonia, and Montenegro, UN officials said they could
not hold back the flood of the dispossessed. Returnees said they
are eager to leave a life of tents and breadlines in refugee camps
even if it means returning to burned and looted homes and a
countryside littered with land mines.
</P>
<P>
   Selim Perquku, 50, drove a tractor with a trailer packed with
three adults and seven children, all family members. There was no
paperwork to do at the Albanian border, only a recording of the
family name and the number of people returning. UN workers also
handed the children a pamphlet warning about land mines.
</P>
<P>
   As the tractor ground its way along the mountain roads from
Albania, the family began to get its first glimpse of the
devastation caused by the war. Perquku had heard in the refugee
camp that their home in the village of Cecili had been destroyed by
Serb forces, and they planned to stay with relatives whose home was
still standing, though it had been ransacked and the windows shot
out.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question on Perquku's mind was the whereabouts of
his son, who was taken from the family home by Serb forces before
the family fled in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to start to rebuild our lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid what we'll see when we get home,'' he said. ``If my
son is there, I will be able to figure out the rest. If he's not, I
don't know how we will go on.''
</P>
<P>
   The influx brought to more than 300,000 the number of ethnic
Albanians who have streamed back into the province in the past 10
days, of approximately 860,000 who left when Serbian forces stepped
up their campaign of mass expulsions from Kosovo, which led to the
NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the largest spontaneous returns that we have
ever seen in the last 25 years of any operation,'' said Paula
Ghedini, a spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees,
at a briefing in the province's capital Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who returned were some 166 ethnic Albanian prisoners
released from Serbian prisons after negotiations between the
Yugoslav government in Belgrade and representatives of the
International Committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees and prisoners are returning to a land ravaged by
war. Many of their homes have been burned and looted by Serbian
forces and paramilitary units. Many more still do not know the
whereabouts of families torn apart by the war.
</P>
<P>
   They are returning despite the pleas of UN officials and
President Clinton, who visited a Macedonian refugee camp this week
and asked ethnic Albanians to wait until UN and aid workers could
at least identify land mines and defuse booby-traps.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, President Clinton said he was ``concerned about'' the
ongoing violence in Kosovo, where NATO forces have been hard
pressed to prevent returning refugees from taking revenge on the
Serbs who remain, and on Serb-owned properties. But Clinton,
speaking at his first extensive press conference since March, also
insisted he was undeterred by the resistance facing NATO troops,
such as a firefight with US Marines Friday. The solution would lie
in the rapid deployment of more peacekeeping troops, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing what we can to stop'' the violence, he said.
``Obviously, if we could get all of our people in completely and
then get them properly dispersed around the country, we'll be able
to provide a far higher level of protection.''
</P>
<P>
   But an equally crucial part of the reconstruction, Clinton said,
would be giving an invisible type of aid to both sides _
``emotionally and psychologically, spiritually, morally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of these children are going to need the mental
health services,'' he said. ``I think there are people who went
through the Holocaust who can help a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also denied he had been caught off guard by the
willingness of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to endure 78
days of NATO bombing. He said the bombing ``took only a little
longer'' than he thought it would.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had two models in my mind on what would happen with the
bombing campaign,'' Clinton said. ``I thought it would either be
over within a couple of days, because Mr. Milosevic would see we
were united, or if he decided to sustain the damage to his country,
that it would take quite a long while for the damage to actually
reach the point where it was unsustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, many ethnic Albanians are turning on their Serb
neighbors as the refugees return after suffering the horrors of the
war and indignity of refugee camps. There has been widespread
looting and burning of Serb homes out of vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   And Serbs are also being killed _ 14 in the province's capital
Pristina alone in the last 48 hours _ in a cycle of violence that
poses a grave challenge to NATO peacekeepers trying to disarm both
sides. With Kosovar Serbs losing faith in NATO's ability to protect
them, thousands have fled their homes and headed north to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Supreme Commander General Wesley Clark said Friday that
Kosovo urgently needs an international police force.
</P>
<P>
   There are plans to move 200 International Police Training Force
officers from Bosnia to initiate a UN-sponsored Kosovo police force
that will include both Kosovar Albanians and Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Another 1,000 UN police are also due to arrive soon.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone in this province is fanning the fires of
vengence. Some are trying to put them out.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun set Friday, an ethnic Albanian, Rifat Kadiru, saw
that the home of a Serb neighbor had been set on fire by teenagers
who claimed to be with the Kosovo Liberation Army. Saying the Serb
family were his friends, Kadiru and his children arrived with
buckets of water and tree branches to try to extinguish bales of
hay that had been ignited inside his friend's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good neighbor and a friend,'' said Kadiru, ``I just
wanted to help him.''

SOME SEE US DOLLAR DOMINATING IN CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Will the queen be forced to abdicate her spot on
Canada's dollar in favor of that old revolutionary rascal George
Washington?
</P>
<P>
   Perish the thought, say Canadian nationalists, fearful their
country's separate cultural and economic identity is already being
squashed under the bigfoot neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   But some prominent economists in Canada are arguing that a
monetary union with the United States is not only likely, but
inevitable, as national economies go global. They predict the
Canadian dollar will follow the beaver pelt and Hudson's Bay
blanket into oblivion as a North American currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US dollar is the most powerful in the world, and one way
or another Canada is going to have to tie to it,'' said Thomas
Courchene, professor of economics at Queen's University in Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ``The march of events elsewhere in the Americas is moving toward
dollarization, using the US dollar as legal tender,'' he said,
referring to Argentina and other Latin American countries giving
consideration to adopting the greenback as their own.
</P>
<P>
   Canada is a rich nation, but in recent years its dollar has
exhibited the sort of instability usually associated with Third
World currencies, dropping to historic lows against the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Now the idea being floated by a few prominent Canadian
economists _ possibly at the tacit urging of Canadian federal
leaders _ is that North America must rally under a common currency
in order to compete against the euro, which is becoming the
monetary standard of an economically integrated Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But the suggestion that Canada should surrender control over its
monetary policy, assuming the US is even interested, is appalling
to many Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big business wants a single dollar and no border,'' said Maude
Barlow, chairwoman of the nationalist Council of Canadians, saying
her country is already too Americanized. ``This would be one more
step toward sacrificing our cultural and political autonomy for
greater integration with the US.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue threatens to ignite the sort of bitter controversy
that divided Canada 10 years ago, when politicians and Canadian
corporate honchos propelled the country into a pact with the US
that would become the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as then, the clamor in Canada has barely registered in the
US, where relations with Mexico are a touchy public issue while
relations with the supposedly ``just-like-us'' northern neighbor
rarely elicit more than yawns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a non-issue in the US,'' said Chris Sands, Canada
Project Director for the Washington-based Center for Strategic and
International Studies. ``Americans tend not to think much about
where the US-Canada relationship is going . . . while Canadians are
always thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Top Canadian federal Cabinet officials are pooh-pooing the
notion of a unified currency, even as they prepare to huddle in a
special meeting next week that will focus on the country's
extraordinarily close economic ties with the US, as well as the
often tortured political ties.
</P>
<P>
   A common currency, said Finance Minister Paul Martin, ``would
not be a good thing for the Canadian economy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the official line, and for good reason: Martin and other
top leaders must run for office, and open support for any move that
smacks of yielding even a smidgen of Canadian sovereignty to the
Yanks is surefire political suicide.
</P>
<P>
   But the Liberal Party government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien
has a reputation for loudly resisting the US embrace while quietly
snuggling ever closer to Washington. For example, Chretien was
elected partly on a pledge to oppose free trade with the US. But
one of his first acts was to join NAFTA, and his government now
champions greater trade integration.
</P>
<P>
   Given that history, the new talk of a common currency seems to
have the fuzzy markings of a trial balloon floated by Canada's
power elite.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was barely a murmur last month, but suddenly, it's all
the buzz. It tops the nightly news on CBC televison and has been
the subject of lengthy articles and commentary in leading
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper released this week, the C.D. Howe Institute, a think
tank whose forecasts often become the official line, urged Ottawa
to open negotiations with the US toward creation of a North
American Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
   Such a union, argued economists Courchene and Richard Harris of
British Columbia's Simon Fraser University, would eliminate the
floating US-Canada exchange rate in favor of a monetary system
controlled by a new central bank in which Canada would hold one of
13 seats, with the rest going to US regions.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the scheme say world economic trends make such a
pact inevitable. ``Currencies are becoming supranational. . . there
will be very few of them left in the world,'' Courchene told the
Toronto-based Globe and Mail newspaper. ``You go through Europe
five years from now, and there will be no small, independent
currencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The big question, of course, is whether the US would ever allow
Canada even a tiny voice in setting US monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's position is that it's okay for other countries to
adopt the American dollar as their currency, but the US is
uninterested in entering any European-style monetary union. The
Clinton administration says there has been no talk of a special
deal for Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had any official discussions between our two
governments about a unified currency,'' said State Department
spokesman James Rubin.

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Two-year-old Bryana Gammel's rosebud lips
gaped open, held by a retractor, to reveal baby teeth that were
rotted down to the gum line. Her long lashes lay against her cheeks
in the forced sleep of anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, Jay Afrow's delicate forceps gripped, wiggled and
wrenched out the decay-stained teeth, until they lay, like tiny
arrowheads, on a surgical tray. Six of them.
</P>
<P>
   He was doing Bryana a great service, but Afrow was not happy.
``This is not the way you want a 2-year-old to grow up,'' he said.
As a dentist to the poor, Afrow sees a great many children who do
grow up this way _ with swollen abscesses, ``baby bottle decay''
like Bryana's, which eats away whole rows of upper teeth, cavities
left untreated until the pain brings screaming.
</P>
<P>
   His practice in New Hampshire is a window onto a chronic
national problem affecting millions of children, a striking
rich-poor inequality that is only beginning to attract concerted
federal attention and action, in Congress, the White House and
health agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The catch phrase for it is ``dental access,'' and its essence is
this: Even though the vast majority of the poorest Americans,
particularly children, are covered by Medicaid for dental care,
they are not getting it _ at least not in numbers anywhere near
children better off.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Several reasons, experts say. Many dentists are
reluctant to take patients on Medicaid, the state-run health
insurance for the poor and disabled, because the program tends to
scrimp on payments and involves pencil-breaking bureaucracy. Also,
Medicaid patients, often with transportation and day-care problems,
are much more likely to miss appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are what officials diplomatically refer to as
``cultural problems,'' illustrated by Afrow's tales of encounters
with parents who view their children's oral decay with equanimity
and say things like, ``Losing all your teeth is just a part of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   At work, too, is an underlying sense among everyone from
insurance planners to state officials to patients that dental care
is somehow secondary and optional. The health safety net has big
holes when it comes to dentistry. Only about half the federally
supported community health centers provide dental services.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are profound disparities in the oral health status of
children in the United States,'' said Burton Edelstein, a national
authority. ``Dental diseases, tooth decay in particular, are
overwhelmingly concentrated in a small subset of kids,'' he said, 5
million to 10 million mainly poor and immigrant children.
</P>
<P>
   Those cavity-riddled poor children belie the general impression
in more prosperous circles that with fluoride, dental sealants that
form barriers against decay, and other advances, cavities are
increasingly a thing of the American past.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute of Dental Research predicts that children
born today can avoid cavities completely, but only if they are
given decent dental care. It has found that for children 5 to 17,
80 percent of cavities are concentrated in a subgroup of fewer than
25 percent of them.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Edelstein said, federal data show that the percentage
of children who experience tooth decay has stayed relatively steady
over recent years; but the percentage of children with decay who
get it repaired has dropped. So for the biggest sufferers, the
problem is actually getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, there seems little dispute over the seriousness of
the problem. Federal health officials call cavities the most
prevalent chronic childhood disease in the country, much more
common than asthma, and estimate that dental disease and treatment
are the cause of 52 million missed school hours a year. Recent
studies make an ever-stronger case that sick mouths can cause
serious problems, from rare heart damage to ``failure to thrive''
in young children. Most common, they say, are pain-induced
problems: malnutrition brought on by aversion to eating, inability
to concentrate in school, sleeplessness, loss of vitality.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon general is preparing a special report to be released
next year on the state of America's oral health, focusing heavily
on children; three bills in Congress this term suggest solutions
like Medicaid reform and tax breaks for dentists who treat many
Medicaid patients, and the American Dental Association plans a
conference in August on children's access to Medicaid-covered
dental care.
</P>
<P>
   But at the state level, there is often dispute aplenty, and it
is of the finger-pointing kind. In New Hampshire, Cassandra
Hawkins, a mother who had to call more than 15 dentists to find one
willing to take her 6-year-old son, is suing the state. She says
that the state has failed on its federally mandated obligation to
provide Medicaid children the same access to care as their
private-paying counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The state's initial response, said Assistant Attorney General
Suzan Lehmann, is that ``it believes it is in compliance with
applicable laws and regulations governing the Medicaid program.''

TALKS BEGIN IN EFFORT TO END CONGO WAR 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda _ After a long series of false starts and stalled
talks, negotiators from central and southern Africa came together
Friday in a determined effort to end the 11-month war in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Following a flurry of high-level meetings in capitals across the
region over the past nine days, foreign ministers from the warring
states gathered Friday night in Lusaka, Zambia, hoping to agree on
an immediate cease-fire, a withdrawal of foreign forces, and
internal political dialogue among all factions in the Democratic
Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were expected to culminate in a meeting Saturday of
the leaders of the countries represented, but it is doubtful if
ministers would be able resolve core disagreements and pave the way
for a signing ceremony by the heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the summit itself is postponed, several factors had
added fresh momentum to the peace process. The principle foreign
sponsors to the conflict, all showing signs of economic and
military fatigue, acknowledge that neither side can achieve an
outright victory on the battlefield. The Congolese rebels have been
allowed to participate in preparatory negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   And South Africa's new president, Thabo Mbeki, has pushed Congo
to the top of his foreign-policy agenda, giving fresh leadership to
a process beset by stubborn suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a debate about the structure of the cease-fire
and a draft on national dialogue among the Congolese, but there is
seriousness on all sides,'' said Jacki Selebi, director-general of
South Africa's ministry of foreign affairs, speaking by phone from
Lusaka, Zambia. ``Everyone is trying to find a peaceful solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite more than a dozen previous rounds of talks, the
fundamental concerns underlying the war remain unresolved. Rwanda
and Uganda backed a rebel insurgency last August to oust Congo
President Laurent Kabila for the same reason they supported a
similar movement a year earlier, that one led by Kabila, to
overthrow Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator of what was then called
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Congo has been a staging ground for rebels to attack
Congo. For Rwanda, the security threat from its giant neighbor is a
matter of national survival.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 genocide in Rwanda killed at least 800,000 people, most
of them from the Tutsi ethnic minority. Many of the killers, former
soldiers loyal to a previous Hutu regime, as well as discontented
Hutu civilians, are now scattered across Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda argues these fighters are determined to resume the
genocide, and it accuses Kabila and his allies of arming them.
Without garentees that these Hutu elements, numbered variously
between 10,000 and 20,000 armed men, will be contained, Rwanda
refuses to withdraw its forces from Congo or sign a cease fire.
Rwanda and Uganda also want Kabila to talk directly with the rebel
forces they back inside Congo.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Kabila refuses either to enter into talks with
the rebels trying to oust him or negotiate with Rwanda and Uganda,
which he regards as foreign aggressors. Backed by Zimbabwe, Angola,
and Nemibia, Kabila demands the withdrawal of all Rwandan and
Ugandan troops, as a precondition for a cease-fire. He also insists
that any accord must recognize his control of all territory inside
Congo, as the UN security council did in April in Resolution 1234.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides view their positions as non-negotiable, and no
previous round of talks has therefore managed to bring all parties
face to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two wars in Congo; one between the Congolese, and
one between Rwanda and its expatriates inside Congo,'' said Jan Zan
Eck, an expert on central Africa at the University of Cape Town. A
cease-fire must adress both conflicts simultaneously, he said, or
the fighting won't end.``Rwanda has specific interests in
overthrowing Kabila. It can't have a president in Kinshasa who
uses'' the Hutu rebels against it.
</P>
<P>
   THe current Lusaka round opened amid manuvering and posturing on
both sides. Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe said earlier this
week that ``we have confirmed cases of agression by Rwanda,'' and
has deployed an additional force, reported to be 3,000 strong, to
defend the strategic mining town of Mbuji-Mayi from Rwandan backed
rebels. Those rebels, riding high on recent military advances, have
meanwhile placed new conditions for peace on Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides also show signs of strain. Zimbabwe has spent an
estimated $1 million a day to defend Kabila while its own economy
has spun into an unprecedented crisis. This week, Mugaba's
government complained the Kabila was not paying his share of
Zimbabwe's military burden inside Congo. Angola has all but pulled
out of Congo amid the resumption of its own civil war. Uganda is
besieged by at least two rebel groups in its western region as well
as by a border dispute with Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Rwandans vow to fight until their security needs are
met, and even they admit to feeling the strain. They claim to have
intelligence showing that Zimbbabwe's newly deployed troops are in
fact re-trained Hutu rebels. They deny Mugabi's claim of further
military advances, and question his good faith participation in the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   `` The logic of reinforcong postions is the logic of preparing
to continue with the war. The issue is not what's on paper but
what's on the ground,'' said Wilson Rutayisira, director of
Rwanda's national information office in Kigali.
</P>
<P>
   At least three separate drafts form the basis of the Lusaka
talks. One, a draft cease-fire brought forward from the previous
round, provides only a vague agreement that ``the signatories
affirm the need to address the security concerns of (Congo) and the
neighboring countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The second is a detailed proposal by Rwanda requiring specific
schedules and sequences for troop withdrawals, clear guidelines for
political negotiations among the Congolese, the modalities of a
cease-fire, and a requirement that Kabila and his allies ``round
up, disarm, and repatriate'' the Rwandan Hutu rebels. All these
points are non-negotiable, said Patrick Mazimhaka, head of the
Rwandan negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
   A thrid draft brought by the south Africans calls for a joint
task team made up of representatives from all the beligerent
parties, the UN, and the Organization of African Unity, to monitor
compliance with the cease-fire until a multinational peacekeeping
force can be marshalled. It also calls for internal Congolese
political diologue.
</P>
<P>
   Both Selebi and Mazimhaka say the various drafts are being
molded into one working framework for peace. The contentious
issues, they said, were disarmament, foriegn troop withdrawl, the
extention of Kabila's authority across Congo, and the struture of
internal political talks among the Congolese. There was also doubt
as to whether Kabila would talk directly with the rebel delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been no breakthroughs,'' Mazimhaka said. ``But so
far no one has walked out.''

 MANCHESTER, N.H.: Medicaid program.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Medicaid is considered a great boon for children's health,
several health officials noted, and it is certainly better to have
Medicaid than no coverage at all. But so striking is the disparity
between Medicaid's mandates and the reality that such suits have
cropped up around the country. The New York Dental Society, a
professional association, sued the state in February, saying that
the state-run Medicaid program reimbursed dentists at rates so low
that most refused to treat Medicaid patients. Of New York's 17,000
dentists, fewer than 1,200 handled in Medicaid claims in 1997,
according to the state Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   The suits highlight the crux of the conflict: Dentists tend to
argue that for them to take more Medicaid patients, the state must
first raise its payment rates; the states tend to argue that
dentists have a social obligation to treat Medicaid patients, even
if payments are low.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Wendell, a pediatric dentist in Portsmouth, N.H., stopped
taking new Medicaid patients a year ago, and on May 1 he sent out
letters to most of his Medicaid contingent, some 700 of them,
saying he could no longer afford to treat them. When he did his tax
statements, he said, he found that though the state says it pays 73
percent of Medicaid claims, he had submitted bills for about
$120,000 and received only about $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year, Wendell said, not a single pediatric dentist
among 17 in New Hampshire has been taking new patients. The state
is ``not willing to pay a dollar more, and access gets worse every
year,'' he said, and in New Hampshire's Medicaid budget, dental
care takes up less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Kassler, the state's medical director, said: ``The
problem New Hampshire is experiencing is being experienced across
the country. Some people have said a Medicaid card is like a
hunting license: it gives you the privilege of going out and
hunting for a dentist.''
</P>
<P>
   But though the problem is clear, Kassler said, ``the issues are
complex, and the solutions are complex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any one particular cause of the problem
and likewise there's not going to be any one simplistic solution,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Kassler said, there does not seem to be broad
public support, in this time of rising health costs, for budgeting
more money to Medicaid programs for dentistry, and it is the state
Legislature that decides the state budget, including the Medicaid
chunk of it. Medicaid is paid by states with matching money from
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the financial issues, he said, some dentists have an
aversion to treating the poor. In surveys, some dentists have made
comments like, ``Nothing empties my waiting room faster than one of
those patients,'' and, ``It's their fault. They're not compliant.
They don't pay attention to hygiene. Why don't they take a bath
before coming in?''
</P>
<P>
   The experience in other states shows that increases in payments
do not necessarily bring prompt increases in access, Kassler said,
but New Hampshire is working to make the Medicaid bureaucracy more
dentist-friendly, and may shift Medicaid money from orthodontics to
more basic children's procedures.
</P>
<P>
   At the federal level, an alphabet brigade of agencies is on the
case, it seems. They are bolstered in particular by new federal
money for children's health insurance, said Edelstein, who
coordinates a joint oral health initiative shared by the two
federal health mega-agencies, the Health Resources and Services
Administration and the Health Care Financing Administration. He
also runs the Children's Dental Health Project, an independent
effort to improve access.
</P>
<P>
   The additional federal health insurance money, budgeted at $4.2
billion this year alone under the government's new Children's
Health Insurance Program, is flowing partly to dental programs.
Also, Edelstein said, programs that deal with children, ranging
from Head Start to maternal-child health programs, are pushing
harder to get care for young teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, however, dentists like Afrow chafe at the system and
see no immediate signs of change. Both Wendell and Afrow often
practice a kind of extreme M.A.S.H. dentistry foreign to their
colleagues in prospering suburbs. It is not uncommon, Afrow and
Wendell say, for a poor child to come in with a dozen cavities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing is, 95 percent of dental problems are
preventable,'' Afrow said. But by the time he gets to see many of
these children, only an operating-room session at $3,000 or more
will help them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For adults on Medicaid, the picture is similar _ except that
they bear some of the blame for their own suffering, and they have
even fewer options. Their Medicaid plans often include only very
partial dental coverage, sometimes of the ``pill and pull''
variety, which covers pain medication and extraction, but not
restorative work like fillings.
</P>
<P>
   The access problem seems most pronounced in rural areas and in
the inner cities. One recent day in Milwaukee, Opal Caples reached
the end of her tolerance. A mother of four covered by Medicaid
through the state welfare program, she had tried spraying her
abscessed teeth with Chloraseptic to ease the pain, and even with
perfume, following the advice of an acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Caples began calling dentists' offices. One said the next
opening was in three months; another said it did not take walk-ins.
She called her health maintenance organization back, and it sent
her to Celestino Perez, whose practice is full of Medicaid
patients. Perez ended up pulling 10 of her teeth over three
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opal is not the worst case, no,'' Perez said. ``The worst case
I've seen was 28 teeth _ all at once.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent operating-room day for Afrow in Manchester, he
counted nine decayed teeth in the mouth of a 5-year-old boy whose
foster mother said he had been sleepless for weeks because of the
pain. Bent over the unconscious child, Afrow quickly fell into the
familiar rhythm he describes as ``fill one, seal one, pull one.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he worked on 2-year-old Bryana, who showed the signs of
``baby bottle decay'' caused by children's sleeping with bottles
containing milk or sweet liquids in their mouths.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Croto, Bryana's grandmother, who had recently gotten
custody of her, said that she knew to take Bryana to Afrow. His
Manchester Dental Alliance clinic at Catholic Medical Center in
Manchester is the dental equivalent of a community health center,
the only major one in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But when Bryana's brother had tooth pain before she knew about
the clinic, Ms. Croto said: ``I called dentist after dentist after
dentist. It took forever to find a dentist for him. They all said
they didn't take Medicaid.''

DESPITE PRESSURE, LEWIS LAWYERS SAY THEY'LL SEEK RETRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- With the key claim in the Reggie Lewis medical
malpractice trial flickered out in a mistrial, the question now
becomes: Will a second panel of jurors be asked to settle the issue
that the first one could not?
</P>
<P>
   After nearly seven weeks of testimony and six days of jury
deliberations, 15 people -- a racially-mixed, mostly female panel
-- could not agree on whether Lewis's chief cardiologist, Gilbert
H. Mudge Jr., was negligent in his treatment of the Celtics star
before his 1993 death.
</P>
<P>
   While lawyers for Lewis's widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, are vowing
``to do it again,'' it's not at all clear whether the small New
York law firm hired by Harris-Lewis -- which has filed for
bankruptcy protection -- has the resources and the resolve to
continue the fight, particularly given that this jury was just four
votes shy of clearing Mudge.
</P>
<P>
   At least for now, and for the public, Harris-Lewis's lawyers are
promising to press on, announcing at a news conference Friday that
they are ``determined'' to retry the case in an ongoing ``search
for justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Donna wants justice and Donna wants closure, and this is not
closure,'' said attorney Robert G. Harley. ``One day, Donna's
children may turn to her and say, `Did you do everything you could
about daddy's death?' and she wants to turn to them and say, `Yes,
I did.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Harley declined to provide a time frame for a retrial, but said
he also intends to appeal the verdicts in favor of Mudge's two
co-defendants, Drs. Peter L. Friedman and Mark A. Creager, who were
cleared of malpractice charges by the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge's attorney, William J. Dailey Jr., did not return a phone
call Friday seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Friedman's lawyer, John P. Ryan, said he believes
Harris-Lewis and her attorneys are ``firm in their purpose to try
it again,'' although he hopes they change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it would be unfortunate if the plaintiff and her
counsel did not keep an open mind to the prospect of not pursuing
this action further,'' he said. ``The emotional turmoil that
everyone endures in a case of this magnitude should give anyone
pause before they'd engage in it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several local attorneys were surprised that
Harris-Lewis, who did not attend the news conference, would be
willing to endure the psychological toll of another trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medical trials are traumatic,'' said James McCarthy, a Boston
malpractice attorney. ``There's so much emotion and tension, it's
almost like waiting for an execution.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCarthy doubts there will be a retrial, and
speculates that the threat of one is little more than a legal
strategy meant to encourage an out-of-court settlement.
</P>
<P>
   By publicly resolving to retry the case, Harris-Lewis and her
attorneys ``create the chemistry, hopefully, to settle the case,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge reportedly is covered by a $5 million malpractice
insurance policy, which could be used for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donna and her lawyers have to let Dr. Mudge and his insurance
carrier know she isn't going to go away, she's not discouraged, and
she will press forward,'' McCarthy said. ``She says she wants to
try the case again, but that, more or less, will put pressure on
the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   But given the split jury, Mudge and his attorney may or may not
be susceptible to that pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides have shown they have the ability to convince jurors
of their case,'' said McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the risk implicit in a retrial should lead to a
settlement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I predict that this case will be settled,'' said McCarthy. ``I
don't think it will be immediately, but probably in many months,
probably on the brink of another trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan and Harley both declined to comment on the possibility of a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the speculation about settling the case, there are
others who believe that Mudge and his lawyer should take seriously
Harris-Lewis's vow to return to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they'll retry it,'' said Boston malpractice attorney
Frederic N. Halstrom.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has the financial wherewithal to pay for the financial
experts all over again,'' he added, noting that Harris-Lewis
received the $9 million remaining in Lewis's five-year, $16.5
million contract when he died.
</P>
<P>
   And with Friedman and Creager out of the way, Halstrom said,
Harris-Lewis's attorneys may have a stronger case by focusing
solely on Mudge.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next case, they're not going to fool around with the
other two doctors, so I don't think Mudge is any better position at
all,'' he said.

 &HT;    Holiday Inn finds room for suites
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Your next family vacation or business trip to Orlando,
Fla., may have just gotten a bit user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, the first all-suite Holiday Inn Resort will open in
Orlando with 800 suites catering to travelers with a variety of
interests, from movie-lovers to fitness buffs and couples wanting a
quiet romantic weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The $80 million property, Holiday Inn Family Suites Resort Lake
Buena Vista, will be located near Epcot Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept is a sequel to kids' suites, which has been so
widely accepted by customers,'' said Terry Whaples, operating
partner for the project.
</P>
<P>
   Suburban Atlanta-based Bass Hotels &AMP; Resorts' other brands
include Crowne Plaza, Inter-Continental, Holiday Inns, Holiday Inn
Select, Holiday Inn Express and Staybridge Suites.
</P>
<P>
   Whaples said other sites are under consideration, though she
declined to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   While theme hotels are not new in the industry, it's unusual to
find so many different themes in one property, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's main drawing card is its 487 Kidsuites, targeted at
families with kids. The two-bedroom suites will have a separate
parlor area with 25-inch television, pull-out sofa and game table.
The suite also will include an adult bedroom and fun-theme kid's
room with bunk beds, video cassette player and Nintendo 64.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been proven that there's a market,'' said Paul
Puryear, a lodging analyst with Raymond James in Tampa, Fla. ``And
this one is in Orlando, which is destination number one for family
travel.''
</P>
<P>
   But kids aren't the only ones being targeted in Orlando. Here's
a sampling of other suites.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cinemasuites: These dozen suites could be called couch potato
heaven. Each features a king bedroom and separate theater room with
a 60-inch color television, surround-sound stereo system and dual
recliners with footrests. The suite also includes a ``reel
package'' of two video rentals, a bag of microwave popcorn and
soda.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fitness Suites: A good deal for those who want to pig out on
vacation, but don't want to feel too guilty about it. Each suite
features a recumbent bike, free weights, exercise mat and abdominal
bench.
</P>
<P>
   Others include a business suite with four-seat conference area
and separate modem line and a residential suite featuring a 50-inch
television and full-service kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Room rates range from $130 to $160.

 &HT;    Union soldiers get full military funeral
 &HT;    By Tucker McQueen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A bugler played Taps and three women in Civil War-era
mourning dress laid flowers on the graves of three Union soldiers
who were honored Friday 135 years after they died.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony at Marietta National Cemetery ended a 17-year
search by Athens writer David Evans, who discovered the identities
of the men while writing a book about Gen. William T. Sherman's
calvary raids around Atlanta in 1864.
</P>
<P>
   ``These three restless souls can be at peace now,'' Evans said.
``They can no longer be counted among our country's unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, privates William Britt, James Harris and David
Sage were listed among 3,000 unknown Union soldiers buried at the
cemetery. With their identities revealed, they were given a proper
funeral with full military honors by the 21st Ohio Living History
group.
</P>
<P>
   Prayers, both Catholic and Protestant, were said and dirt from
the County Tipperary, Ireland, grave of Britt's parents was
scattered on his grave. Evans said he did not know why the
38-year-old Irish immigrant joined the Union army.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's ceremony validates Evan's quest to have the men
remembered by more than a set of numbers engraved on six-inch high
marble markers. He identified a fourth member of the 5th Iowa
Calvary, Capt. William Curl, two years ago and he was recognized in
a ceremony then.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Findlay, the great grandson of Harris, and his wife Katie
traveled from Poplar Bluff, Mo., for the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so glad to see him honored,'' Katie Findlay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought someone had tossed his body somewhere after he died
and he would never be found.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the remains of Union soldiers killed in Georgia
and Alabama were recovered and brought back to the cemetery for
burial. Evans found an old burial register at the Marietta cemetery
that listed two casualties from Alabama on July 18, 1864. The
burial register didn't name the dead men, but a list of casualties
compiled by doctors on both sides after a skirmish at Beasley Tank,
40 miles east of Montgomery, included Sage and Harris as killed.
Britt was among seven listed as wounded. Lists from the surgeon at
the Confederate hospital and the Union cavalry's surgeon both
listed Britt dying from his wounds in the Confederate hospital Aug.
8.
</P>
<P>
   Evans strengthened his case by documenting the release of the
six other wounded men from the Confederate prison camp in
Andersonville after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Cemetery administrator Jim Wallace said he reviewed Evans'
research last fall and found it convincing. He said before a
tombstone is engraved with a name, the identity has to be proven
beyond a reasonable doubt. Because Sage and Harris fell the same
day, it is impossible to tell who is buried in which grave. Their
stones identify them as members of the 5th Iowa Calvary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even my wife asked me why I spent so much time on this,''
Evans said. ``These men became real to me. They became my boys, my
family.

REPORT CITES GENDER BALANCE ON FEDERAL COURT   STAFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Unlike a similar report 11 years ago that found
widespread gender bias in the state courts of Massachusetts, a
survey released Friday found that women are proportionately
represented at nearly all levels of the federal courts in
Massachusetts and three other New England states.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a survey of 2,000 court employees, lawyers and
litigants suggested that more women are needed in the high-level
court positions and minorities remain underrepresented throughout
the federal court system in the region.
</P>
<P>
   And, despite strides, vestiges of sexism remain, with women
attorneys reporting that they are sometimes addressed as ``honey,''
assumed not to be lawyers, or acknowledged for the outfits they're
wearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``While our problems are not as great as other circuits, any
manifestation of discrimination, no matter how slight, is still too
much and we ought not to tolerate it,'' said federal Appeals Judge
Bruce M. Selya, who coordinated two task forces which conducted the
gender, race and ethnic bias study in the federal courts of
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that the majority of court workers and lawyers
who use the federal courts believe there is little gender or racial
bias and the courts have taken steps to ameliorate any that does
exist.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between the upbeat federal survey, the first ever
done in the First Circuit, and the earlier damning Massachusetts
state court survey, may be due to the passage of time, Selya
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time goes by, people become more enlightened on these
issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most frequent complaints against federal judges in the
survey was their unwillingness to accommodate lawyers' schedules
and a failure to take lawyers' views seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also complained about incivility, mostly on the part
of other lawyers rather than judges.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that the lack of civility interferes with effective case
management, the report recommended a policy statement on attorney
conduct. In addition, the report recommended that each court adopt
a local rule governing biased behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Selya said incivility among lawyers was ``a huge problem'' that
was being addresses by several committees of the American Bar
Association. ``I suspect it is emblematic of society as a whole,''
he said. ``People aren't as polite as they as they used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The report found that women represent a slim majority of both
attorney and law clerk positions in the federal courts and a large
majority of staff positions, including nearly half of all
management positions.
</P>
<P>
   However, women are underrepresented as heads of court units,
holding only seven of 25 positions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, there were four female judges in the First Circuit,
including the Court of Appeals, the district, magistrate and
bankruptcy courts. By 1997, 12 of the 82 judgeships were held by
women, almost 15 percent. However, that is still below the national
average of nearly 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, there were two minority judges on federal courts in
Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. By 1997, the
figure had increased to three of 66 judges, or 4.5 percent, still
more than 50 percent below the national average of nearly 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only eight percent of federal court employees in Maine,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island are minorities, a
figure the report blamed partly on the low minority populations in
states like Maine and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of 20 unit heads are minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Selya said he hopes the circuit judicial conference will adopt
the task force recommendations, which include educational and
sensitivity programs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In the financial subplot of Indonesia's
political transformation, few events have demonstrated the progress
and pitfalls as clearly as the agreement this week between PT Astra
International and its creditors on how the company will pay back
more than $1 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Astra is a $1.7 billion company with interests from palm oil to
Nike shoes. It is best known, however, for assembling the Toyota
utility vehicles and Honda motorcycles that choke this city's
streets as well as for its ties to the business empire of former
President Suharto's family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   After 11 months of negotiations, Astra held a signing ceremony
and banquet Wednesday to commemorate the deal. Coming as it did in
a week of quickening signs that Indonesia's prospects are
improving, the ceremony was heralded as a turning point for both
the company and the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we can say, not only is the light at the end of the
tunnel, but we've reached the end of the tunnel _ and the light,''
said Sri Mulyani Indrawati, director of the University of
Indonesia's Institute of Social and Economic Research, speaking
before the bankers, shareholders and company executives on hand at
the $165-a-night Shangri-La Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates are falling, inflation appears in check and
stocks as well as the Indonesian currency have risen to levels not
seen since the early days of the crisis. With economists predicting
companies here will soon see profits again, officials hope Astra's
achievement will prompt other companies to cut deals on the roughly
$70 billion they owe foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia is by no means out of the dark. That point is perhaps
best illustrated by the identity of Astra's controlling
shareholder, and its largest creditor: the government agency
created to rescue Indonesia's banks. Even as the votes are counted
to determine Indonesia's first freely elected leaders in 40 years,
therefore, the new government is already burdened with the task of
raising the estimated $60 billion needed to create healthy lenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a trade-off,'' said Sudarshan Gooptu, a World Bank
economist. ``There is a constituency out there saying they'd like
more money to go into direct poverty alleviation. But if you want
the economy to grow again, the banking system has to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate debt restructuring is a prerequisite to that recovery.
If Astra's deal is any indication, further agreements may have less
to do with renewed confidence among lenders than with their own
pessimism about recovering their debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no legal framework and companies don't want to
negotiate with banks,'' said Koji Yamashita, head of international
credit at the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan. The bank is trying to
recover its roughly $700 million share of the money Indonesian
companies owe foreign banks before winding up its foreign
operations as part of its own takeover by Japan's government.
Japan's own financial problems have made Japanese lenders reluctant
to compromise with lenders if it means adding losses to their
already fragile balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the International Monetary Fund, which is
leading a $43 billion rescue package for Indonesia, this week noted
Indonesia's progress, but said the government needed to lower
interest rates further, increase spending and accelerate financial
reforms.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indonesia's Bank Restructuring Agency made some progress this
week by securing pledges from 173 of the nation's 200 largest
corporate debtors to repay their loans. Earlier this month, the
agency publicized a list of those borrowers. The finance minister
subsequently threatened to name owners of the companies that do not
cooperate, but their identities were already well-known: the list
included several companies with Suharto links.
</P>
<P>
   No. 21 on the list, for example, is PT Nusantara Ampera Bakti,
or Nusamba, a conglomerate created by three Suharto foundations,
one of Suharto's sons and his longtime golfing buddy and business
associate, Mohammad ``Bob'' Hasan.
</P>
<P>
   Hasan was Astra's chairman until he resigned a year ago. Nusamba
is also Astra's second-largest shareholder, which partly explains
why the bank restructuring agency now controls Astra.
</P>
<P>
   Astra's trouble with bankers began last August, when it told
them it wanted to restructure loan payments. It hired Chase
Manhattan Corp. and Sakura Bank Ltd. to advise how to negotiate
with more than 100 creditors, bankers and bondholders _ and in
October stopped making interest payments. Bankers then warned that
they would not even discuss restructuring, but in November, Astra
went ahead and appointed a restructuring committee from among its
largest lenders. Then it devised a restructuring plan of its own
and made an offer: Discuss the plan or take 30 cents on the dollar
and walk away _ a ``haircut,'' as a loan write-off is known in
banking parlance.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers balked. Astra officials say Japanese bankers,
Indonesia's largest foreign lenders, were especially loath to deal.
``If we took a haircut on Astra, everyone would want us to take a
haircut,'' said Shingo Ota, head of corporate banking in Singapore
for the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., Astra's largest foreign
lender.
</P>
<P>
   For three months, Astra and its advisers made weekly trips to
Singapore for talks with the committee that bore an almost comic
``we can't pay the rent, you must pay the rent'' monotony. ``It was
tiring,'' said Edianto Prasetyo, senior manager of Astra's banking
relations department.
</P>
<P>
   The impasse was only broken when Astra offered a new plan that
included paying the interest it had missed and accelerating
repayment of the principal. By May, creditors had approved the
plan, and after a month to do paperwork, Astra and its lenders were
breaking bread together at the Shangri-La.

LEWIS'S LEGACY ALREADY SECURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The unsanctioned monuments continue to pop up without
warning, walls adorned with images of the Celtics' Reggie Lewis in
full flight. Alive.
</P>
<P>
   They are more than the inspired doodlings of street artists;
they are the depiction of the continuing grief and shock caused by
Lewis's death at 27, a sort of people's tribute.
</P>
<P>
   They are one version of Reggie Lewis's legacy. Another, more
official, interpretation failed to emerge from the malpractice
trial that ended Thursday with no conclusion other than sadness.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of withering public criticism, Donna Harris-Lewis
has always maintained that this trial was never about money, and it
wasn't. It really wasn't about medical malpractice, either. It was
about heroes, about whom we worship and why.
</P>
<P>
   Three days before jury selection began, Harris-Lewis said the
catalyst for her suit was not her husband's death but rather Dr.
Gilbert H. Mudge Jr.'s allegation that Lewis had confided cocaine
use to him shortly before his death.
</P>
<P>
   Despite assertions that a pattern of drug use would be revealed
at trial, the actual evidence turned out to be scant. Job Fuchs,
the 82-year-old retired health director at Northeastern University,
Lewis's alma mater, was expected to testify that Lewis tested
positive for cocaine in 1987 while playing for the school. Instead,
in the space of ten minutes on the witness stand, Fuchs testified
both that Lewis had and that he had not tested positive. So
confused was his testimony that Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith ordered
jurors to disregard it.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis's lawyers didn't have to shoot holes in the
deposition given by Wayne Brown, who claimed to have snorted
cocaine with Lewis during their Northeastern days. He did that
himself, admitting that he was high during most of the time he was
testifying about. Brown did not actually appear on the stand, in
what would seem an uncharacteristically shrewd move.
</P>
<P>
   A third defense witness, Ronald J. Marks, a recovering addict,
testified that he saw Lewis snorting an unspecified white powder in
a bathroom during a Celtics' charity auction. Legal analysts have
said they doubt the cocaine evidence influenced the outcome of the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Until I met Harris-Lewis for the first time shortly before the
case went to court, I was almost prepared to believe that this
lawsuit was an exercise in unbridled greed, a grab for more money
by someone who was already worth millions.
</P>
<P>
   In person, my cynicism evaporated. Her passion was obvious. Her
conviction that her family had been wronged, that her husband could
have survived his heart condition, was powerful. She considered it
her duty to her children to absolve her husband of allegations of
drug use.
</P>
<P>
   She has done that. And while it may be legally correct to say
there was no verdict, that technicality is hardly the whole story.
The finding was that her case did not clear the high bar that
proves medical malpractice. Given the painstaking preparation that
went into this case _ it is reputed to be the most expensive
malpractice case in Massachusetts history _ it's hard to see why
Harris-Lewis would fare better in another trial.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyers, Bridget Assaro and Robert G. Harley, said Friday
they expect a second trial in a matter of ``weeks or months, not
years.'' They said Harris-Lewis, who was secluded at home with her
family, will not stop until she believes justice is done. I hope
she reconsiders and accepts the partial victory she has already
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people who found it easy to believe that a young black
athlete was a cocaine user thought this trial was a slam dunk for
Mudge. They were wrong. But there is more to winning a malpractice
trial than simply prevailing on one issue.
</P>
<P>
   For thousands, Lewis was a hero, not only for his play on the
basketball court, but for the way he conducted himself off the
court _ his tireless work for youth, his unassuming demeanor and
gentle manner. For those people, I believe, neither this trial nor
any succeeding trial will shake that faith.
</P>
<P>
   To those invested in believing the worst, they will continue to
do so, lack of evidence be damned. Neither group took any solace
from what happened, and neither were any minds changed.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Lewis was a basketball player, plain and simple. He
surely did not lead a perfect life, any more than do any of the
rest of us. But his legacy does not depend on perfection. The
people Reggie Lewis cared about most have had their say on the
meaning of his life. And that verdict _ secure from critics,
doubters or juries _ is the only one worth fighting for.

 &HT;    Judge seals Coke documents
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The federal judge overseeing the race discrimination
case against Coca-Cola Inc. has ruled that personnel information
about individual employees and any documents that, if disclosed,
may put the company at a competitive disadvantage will remain from
public view.
</P>
<P>
   In an order signed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Atlanta,
Judge Richard Story defined what will constitute ``confidential
information'' during the litigation and be kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Story said his protective order will expedite pretrial discovery
_ the period when both sides exchange information to build their
cases. He said the order also represents the ``least-onerous
alternative for balancing the public's access to its judicial
process with the specific, legitimate interests of the litigants
and other affected persons.''
</P>
<P>
   The four black plaintiffs in the lawsuit allege discrimination
in pay, promotion, performance evaluations and terminations. They
are seeking class-action status for their case. Coca-Cola has
strongly denied the accusations and wants the judge to block the
class-action effort.
</P>
<P>
   Story's ruling does not restrict information that Coca-Cola must
provide to the plaintiffs and their attorneys during the discovery
phase, which could last into next year. It affects what can be made
public.
</P>
<P>
   In his six-page order, Story said confidential information will
include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Business information that could cause ``a financial hardship''
or would place the producer of the information ``at a competitive
disadvantage and could include, for example, trade secrets,
manufacturing processes, customer lists, technical or research
information and internal financial information.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Individual employee information, including the contents of
personnel files, medical records, complaints of discrimination in
which an employee is identified and documents describing an
employee's compensation, promotion, employment history,
disciplinary action or termination.
</P>
<P>
   These restrictions do not appear to include Coca-Cola documents
that outline company employee practices, internal documents that
may criticize or applaud the company's hiring and firing of
minority employees, or conclusions reached by experts who examine
the Coca-Cola's employee computer database.
</P>
<P>
   But if any restricted information is included in a court motion
or is discussed in a transcript of pretrial testimony, this must be
deleted before being placed in the public court file, Story ruled.
Undeleted versions will go to the judge and be kept confidential by
the parties, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's fair,'' Coca-Cola spokesman Rob Baskin said of
Story's order. ``It restricts individual salaries and personnel
information from being public. We think that's appropriate in a
case like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cyrus Mehri, an attorney for the African-American
plaintiffs, ``We believe that court secrecy should be limited to
narrowly defined areas, such as trade secrets and individual
personal information.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Story said either party can designate parts of
the information that they think must be kept confidential ``so long
as the party who seeks confidentiality has a good faith belief that
it is entitled to confidentiality under the terms of this order.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the case are administrative assistant Motisola
Malikha Abdallah, security officer Gregory Allen Clark, consumer
information specialist Linda Ingram and former director Kimberly
Gray Orton.

 &HT;    CLINTON CALLS FOR 'SEASON OF PROGRESS' ON ISSUES
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton asked the Republican-controlled
Congress on Friday to set aside partisan politics for ``a season of
progress'' on a host of domestic issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be judged on what we do with this opportunity, whether
we seize it or squander it,'' Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
   The president used a speech at Georgetown University and a
lengthy news conference at the White House _ his first since March
19 _ to focus attention on issues that have eclipsed this year by
his impeachment trial and the NATO bombing campaign in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that ``obviously, the closer you get to the
election, perhaps the more difficult it will be'' to enact major
legislation, Clinton vowed to ``keep working right up to the very
end'' of his term in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be plenty of time for politics in the year and a
half ahead, but this summer must be a season of progress,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent on his list of priorities were Medicare, Social
Security, gun control, education and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   But with the 2000 presidential election already heating up, and
his wife considering a bid for the U.S. Senate from New York,
Clinton inevitably faced questions about whether his personal
behavior would be a political liability, especially for Vice
President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``All elections are about the future, and all candidates are
judged on their own merits,'' he said. ``I think that the American
people know the country is in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   He defended Hillary Rodham Clinton's use of Air Force planes for
travel to New York state as she weighs a Senate campaign, saying
the Secret Service requires her to fly on government planes.
</P>
<P>
   And although he insisted that the first lady still has not made
a final decision on whether to run for the Senate, he boosted her
senatorial prospects by praising her efforts on domestic policy.
</P>
<P>
   The president's dual appearances marked a new phase in the
partisan battle with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Clinton's morning speech, House Republicans held a
morning rally at the Capitol in an effort to steal his relations
thunder.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois told reporters that the
GOP has ``the best agenda for the American people.'' He promised
the GOP-led Congress would focus its energy on a national missile
defense, education reform, Social Security and, most prominently,
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask the president: please include tax relief in your
agenda,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   At his press conference, Clinton responded: ``I'm not against
tax cuts.'' But, he added, ``The question is, what kind of tax cut?
Who benefits from it? How should it be designed? And how should it
be handled to guarantee that we're going to take care of first
things first _ strengthening Social Security and Medicare, paying
down the debt, continuing to secure the health of the American
economy?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared relaxed and upbeat during the unusually long
75-minute news conference, occasionally joking with reporters as he
fielded 27 questions on a variety of subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he plans next week to unveil a plan for
Medicare that would extend prescription drug coverage to elderly
Americans. ``I don't think there's any alternative here,'' he said,
noting that prescription drug coverage is ``the most significant
health care need that senior citizens have today.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he sought to delay the election-year politics that are
quickly overtaking legislative action in Congress, the president
continued assailing the Republicans for failing to enact a bill to
require background checks on purchases at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't expect young people to stand up to violence when
Congress won't stand up to the gun lobby,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged that Americans are ``worried'' that ``the
fabric of life (is) still under great strain,'' as evidenced by the
``shattering effect'' of this spring's high school shootings in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the events of the past year _ his impeachment and
admitted sexual liaison with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky _ placed him at a disadvantage when it comes to pressing
moral issues, Clinton said he had acknowledged that what he did was
``dead wrong'' and that he is going to spend ``the rest of my life
trying to rectify that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he is more comfortable taking personal
responsibility for his actions, as opposed to those who ``go around
trying to give a lot of speeches about how good they are and then
open the door for the gun lobby to run the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton tried to refocus public attention on his
domestic agenda, questions about Kosovo, Chinese espionage and
peace in Ireland were among the issues raised at the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he is ``not particularly surprised'' that ethnic
Albanians are taking revenge on Serbs upon returning to their homes
in Kosovo, but said NATO is ``doing what we can'' to stop the
violence as refugees return home.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Serbian people would have to ``come to grips''
with the atrocities Yugoslavian leader Slobodan Milosevic ordered
in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have to decide if they think that is okay,''
he said. ``And if they think it's okay, they can make that
decision, but I wouldn't give them one red cent for reconstruction
if they think it's okay because ... I don't think that's the world
we're trying to build for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   When a questioner asked about the $5 million U.S. reward offered
for the arrest of Milosevic and colleagues for alleged war crimes,
Clinton locked his gaze and said, ``We have not put a price on Mr.
Milosevic's head for someone to kill him. ... So let's get that
clear.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his biggest surprises during the NATO bombing of
Yugoslavia were that NATO did not lose any pilots and that the
Chinese Embassy was accidentally bombed. ``I was surprised and
heartbroken,'' he said of the embassy bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite investigations revealing lax security at U.S. nuclear
labs, Clinton gave Energy Secretary Bill Richardson a vote of
confidence. Richardson is ``being very, very aggressive'' in
tightening up security at the labs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He urged all sides to break the deadlock in the Northern Ireland
peace agreement and meet a crucial deadline next week for
implementing the accord.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who played a major part in securing the Good Friday
peace accord last year, said he would do whatever he could to help
the parties save the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   About his own critics at home _ ``particularly the right wing''
_ the president said he cannot allow them to distract him from the
nation's business. He said he tells his staff: ``We have no right
to harbor anger'' that would interfere with the obligation to serve
the public.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also promised that his long-delayed report on race would
be published soon. ``I want to make sure that when we put this
document out it is in the form of a book which can be useful and
have something to say, and move the conversation and the efforts
beyond where we were in the presidential initiative on race,'' he
said.

6 U.S. EMBASSIES IN AFRICA CLOSED TEMPORARILY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Gambia, Madagascar, Namibia, Senegal, Liberia, Togo, Kenya
and Tanzania . )   By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several U.S. and British embassies in Africa
remained shut Friday in response to evidence that they might be
under surveillance by terrorist groups planning an attack, Clinton
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries closed their embassies temporarily in Gambia,
Madagascar and Namibia. The United States also closed its embassies
in Liberia and Togo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had information suggesting suspicious individuals were
surveying the sites,'' said James Rubin, the State Department
spokesman, ``and as a precautionary, prudent measure, we suspended
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   The department said that all operations had been suspended at
the embassies.
</P>
<P>
   The only employees on duty are U.S. Marine guards, the
department said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, intelligence officials said there was
evidence that Osama bin Laden was making final preparations for
another attack on U.S. installations. Bin Laden, a Saudi exile, has
been indicted in the United States as the mastermind of the
bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last summer.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British officials said suspicious individuals had been
seen carrying out surveillance of embassy compounds in Africa in
recent days, but the officials would not say if they believed them
to be associates of bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Rubin said Friday that ``we have seen a pattern of
activity indicating continued planning for terrorist attacks by
members of Osama bin Laden's network, and we take reporting of such
threats seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the embassy bombings last Aug. 7, the United States has
closed a number of embassies around the world _ often in Africa _
for short times in response to reports of terrorist threats.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said that the six U.S. embassies closed on
Thursday would remain shuttered through Sunday, and that a decision
would be made during the weekend whether they would reopen on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin insisted that terrorists were not having an impact on U.S.
foreign policy. ``We have foiled their objective of stopping our
determination to have an American presence around the world and to
interfere with our determination as a global power to have American
troop presence in various countries,'' he said. ``So they have
failed.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``That doesn't mean we don't have to adjust our
practices, that we don't have to spend more money to protect our
people, and we are determined to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In London a spokesman for the British Foreign Office said it had
closed its diplomatic missions in Africa because ``we have
information of a possible threat to diplomatic missions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking the threat seriously and have taken the
precautionary measure of temporarily closing our missions in these
countries,'' the spokesman said, adding that diplomatic staff
members were not being evacuated, because ``the possible threat is
to diplomatic missions, not to British nationals.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say if the closings of the British embassies had
been coordinated with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aware of the closure of U.S. missions in a number of
African countries,'' he said, ``and we do maintain close contacts
with the Americans on security matters. But we never comment on any
security or intelligence matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press quoted a spokesman for Gambia's Foreign
Ministry, Cherno Jallow, as saying his government had not seen the
need for additional security measures in its capital, Banjul.
</P>
<P>
   ``The temporary closure is warranted by external factors _ that
is, the Americans' fear that bin Laden is planning to mount
terrorist attacks on U.S. installations in the Gambia,'' he said.

GERMAN PARLIAMENT APPROVES PLAN FOR MEMORIAL TO JEWS KILLED IN THE
HOLOCAUST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating to correct coding.)  By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ After a decade of increasingly fraught debate over the
place of memory in a society now two generations removed from the
Nazi era, the German Parliament approved a plan Friday for the
building of a vast memorial in the heart of this city to the six
million Jewish victims of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The vote opened the way for the construction near the
Brandenburg Gate of a project designed by the New York architect
Peter Eisenman. It will combine a field of more than 2,000 stone
pillars with a building that is officially being called a
``documentation center'' but will have many of the attributes of a
Holocaust museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not building this monument solely for the Jews,'' said
Wolfgang Thierse, the speaker of Parliament. ``We are building it
for ourselves. It will help us confront a chapter of our history.''
</P>
<P>
   That confrontation has been going on for many years, often with
a wrenching honesty. So insistent has reflection on Hitler been
that many Germans have become impatient with it.
</P>
<P>
   The country's protracted difficulty in reaching agreement on
what sort of memorial, if any, to build in the Berlin now being
reborn as the capital of a united Germany clearly reflected a
tension between remembrance and a growing desire among young
Germans to emerge from history's long shadow.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate on those issues had become increasingly
circuitous and the vast site reserved for the memorial between the
glistening, newly built Potsdamer Platz and the reopened Reichstag
had become a growing embarrassment. As other empty stretches of
land were filled with new buildings, the 4.9-acre vacant lot began
to resemble a hole in the city's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office eight months ago, the center-left Government
of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has pushed for a decision, and its
top cultural official, Michael Naumann, has led the quest for a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts evidently paid off Friday as Parliament voted by 314
to 209, with 14 abstentions, to approve Eisenman's ambitious
project. In many ways, the memorial's size and position insure that
it will be a central element in the emergent city of refurbished or
newly built ministries and embassies mushrooming where the Berlin
wall once stood and where Hitler once presided.
</P>
<P>
   The vote backed a compromise reached between Eisenman and
Naumann last January. The agreement involved reducing the number of
stone pillars to about 2,000 from close to 3,000 and adding a
building that will house an extensive archive, an information
center and an exhibition space.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the compromise reflected a desire to combine the
purely artistic expression of remembrance and remorse with a center
that would be accessible and useful. Naumann called the idea a
``superb synthesis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The 10-year discussion has at last reached a successful
conclusion,'' said Andreas Nachama, the head of the Berlin Jewish
community. ``Now the plans can finally be implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was evident in Parliament Friday that strong reservations
persist, particularly in Berlin itself. Mayor Eberhard Diepgen, a
Christian Democrat, denounced Eisenman's project for its
``monumentality'' and said it would have no resonance for future
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Diepgen is known for his intimate sense of this city's mood, and
with elections later this year, he clearly took a position that he
believes will be well received locally.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, city authorities could still stall the construction,
now set to begin next year, but that seems unlikely given
Parliament's clear message Friday that the time has come to get on
with it.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor had backed a plan for a far smaller stone memorial
inscribed simply with the words ``Thou Shalt not Kill'' proposed
earlier this year by a Berlin theologian, Richard Schroeder, saying
that its ``precision, dignity and modesty'' gave it more power than
Eisenman's project. But the Parliament voted today to reject that
idea.
</P>
<P>
   One evident problem with the inscription ``Thou Shalt not Kill''
is that it appeared to reflect the mood of the Germany of the
post-war years with its insistence that ``only peace'' would go out
from German soil, rather than the Germany that has recently been at
war in the Balkans and has now sent thousands of peacekeeping
troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted by the conflict of two basic principles of the
post-war German state _ ``No more war'' and ``No more Auschwitz'' _
Chancellor Schroeder's government has sided with the latter,
explaining its decision to join the NATO bombardment of Kosovo in
terms of the need to stop ethnic persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Before approving Eisenman's plan, the Parliament voted by 325 to
218, with 8 abstentions, to support the building of a memorial
specifically dedicated to the Jews, rather than one to all victims
of the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   One German Jewish leader, Solomon Korn, expressed regret over
the decision. ``The Bundestag made a mistake by voting for a
memorial that commemorates only the Jewish victims of the
Holocaust,'' he said. ``By doing so, it creates the impression that
there is a hierarchy among the victims.''
</P>
<P>
   But in general Germany's small but growing Jewish community _
swelled recently by the arrival of thousands of Jews from Russia _
expressed satisfaction at the outcome.

   Birthday Greetings To the Bar Code &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Do you remember where you were on June 26, 1974?
</P>
<P>
   As memorable anniversaries go, it probably doesn't stick in most
minds like Nov. 22 (1963) or July 20 (1969) or, for really long
memories, Dec. 17 (1903 _ think Kitty Hawk).
</P>
<P>
   But 25 years ago Saturday, at the Marsh Supermarket in Troy,
Ohio, the very first product _ a pack of Wrigley's Juicy Fruit gum
_ was swept across the very first checkout scanner, and shopping
would never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration, since it had long
been obvious what was coming. There were pen-type bar code readers
in use at that time, and the idea of putting standardized bar codes
on products dates from a grocery-industry initiative in the late
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was the advent of scanners at the supermarket checkout
that injected the technology into popular consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   NCR, the company whose scanner it was that fine June day in
Ohio, has had a rocky time of it since then, passing in and out of
ownership by AT&AMP;T and in and out of the PC industry, among other
travails.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, though, it stuck with point-of-service systems
(you know, cash registers), and it now estimates that its scanners
ring up 1.4 billion items a day.
</P>
<P>
   (The company is also a big player in another
pocketbook-transforming technology, the automated teller machine.
It likes to say it is in ``the business of translating transactions
into relationships.'')
</P>
<P>
   Bar codes have since penetrated all corners of modern life,
helping to keep track of everything from freight cars to blood
samples to carry-on baggage. Cattle are branded with them. A few
years back, a millenarian cult even handed out fliers warning of a
nefarious government plot to tattoo them on everyone's forehead.
How the authorities would get people to rub their foreheads across
checkout counters, the fliers didn't say. &QL;

BRUINS RETAIN TALLAS, LOSE ROBITAILLE IN EXPANSION DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Rob Tallas went nowhere. Peter Ferraro went to
Atlanta, but was back before he knew it. Randy Robitaille, who
opened the Stanley Cup playoffs as the Bruins' substitute
first-line center, Friday became a charter member of the expansion
Atlanta Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   So went the 1999 expansion draft from the Bruins' perspective.
In order to avoid losing the gregarious and reliable Tallas, their
primary backup to Byron Dafoe, Boston gave up the 23-year-old
Robitaille, who collected 24 goals and 102 points with Providence
this past season as the AHL's No. 2 point-getter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want to give up a player you think can help you,''
said Bruins assistant general manager Mike O'Connell. ``We looked
at what we had at the position, and the fact that, for us, Randy
Robitaille has to be a first- or second-line player.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's selections, which took GM Don Waddell only some five
minutes to announce at the FleetCenter, provided the NHL's 28th
club few scorers. If Robitaille can show anywhere near the kind of
pop he had in both the AHL and earlier in college (Miami-Ohio), the
Thrashers might have maneuvered for a viable scoring force.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, in turn, may have dealt one away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it would have been nice to play for Boston, the
club that gave me my first opportunity in the NHL,'' said
Robitaille, signed out of college as a free agent March 27, 1997.
``But if you look at their center position, they're pretty well set
up the middle. It's not like Jason Allison or Joe Thornton are on
the brink of retirement. Maybe there's room there for a checking
center or a fourth-line guy in the middle, but that's not my
role.''
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille's window of opportunity here in the Hub of hockey was
about the size of Liechtenstein. Prior to 1998-'99, he was given
limited ice time in five games and was unable to produce a point.
He picked up only a pair of assists in four regular-season games
and then got one chance in the postseason, moving to the pivot in
Game 1 vs. Carolina when Thornton was sidelined with an injured
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Working between Sergei Samsonov and Dmitri Khristich in the
playoff opener, Robitialle looked out of synch, constantly behind
the play. The following morning, he was back on a plane to
Providence, where in the next six weeks he helped lead the Baby B's
to the Calder Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand why they got rid of me,'' said Robitaille,
who finished second only to Rochester's Dominic Pittis (38-66_104)
in AHL scoring. ``There's really no room for me. I can't fault
them, but I thought I had done a pretty good job at the minor
league level.''
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille was on the Bruins' protected list, which was
submitted to the league within 48 hours after the Stars clinched
the Stanley Cup Saturday night in Buffalo. When it became clear the
Thrashers were going to take Tallas, O'Connell began negotiating
with Atlanta GM Don Waddell. Waddell agreed to pass on Tallas and
take Ferraro, provided the Bruins in turn would make a
Robitaille-for-Ferraro swap.
</P>
<P>
   As the night played out, the Thrashers contined to work more
deals. Their biggest move was sending netminder Trevor Kidd, whom
they selected from the Hurricanes, to the Florida Panthers for a
package that included former Bruin Gord Murphy, originally acquired
by the Panthers in the '93 expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers also picked up the free agent rights to veteran
defenseman Ulf Samuelsson, who finished the season with the Wings
after being dealt from the Rangers. The Wings didn't want to lose
veteran center Igor Larionov and agreed to give up Samuelsson if
the Thrashers selected someone else. Atlanta took netminder Norm
Maracle, the 24-year-old backup to Chris Osgood. Samuelsson is an
unrestricted free agent. If he signs anywhere other than Atlanta,
the Thrashers will receive a compensatory pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough decision,'' said Waddell, asked about passing
up the chance to select Larionov, who many suspect one day will be
a head coach in the NHL. ``He has one of the best minds of any
player I've ever met. We talked at length about taking him, but we
just felt, for an expansion club, he wasn't the right player for us
at this time.''

<HEADLINE>
LAWYER SAYS EX-MISTRESS REJECTED CISNEROS SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A lawyer testified in federal court Friday that
Linda Jones rejected a $30,000 settlement he brokered with former
Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros following the collapse of their
extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Pat Maloney, was one of three witnesses who
contradicted testimony from Jones in a pre-trial hearing to
determine if her taped telephone conversations with Cisneros can be
used by the government when Cisneros goes on trial Sept. 7 for
alleged conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio lawyer said he told Jones, also known by her
married name, Linda Medlar, that she had weak legal standing
against Cisneros at the end of the affair because his promises of
financial support were verbal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal vineyards were sparse, indeed,'' Maloney told U.S.
District Judge Stanley Sporkin.
</P>
<P>
   She then rejected the settlement Maloney had arranged, although
it was accepted by Cisneros through his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 50, denied earlier this week that Maloney had dismissed
her chances of winning a breach of contract lawsuit against
Cisneros, and she denied receiving a letter from the lawyer saying
he would not proceed with legal action.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney, though, recalled her being upset with his assessment
that her case was weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Marine Corps, we tried to avoid the language she
used,'' Maloney said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones later sued Cisneros for breach of contract. It was during
proceedings in that lawsuit, which was later settled for $49,000,
that Cisneros and his attorney learned that she had secretly taped
their telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The recordings are the guts of Independent Counsel David
Barrett's case against Cisneros, 52, who is charged with
orchestrating a conspiracy to conceal $250,000 in hush money he
paid Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackowski, a prosecutor for the independent counsel, said
Cisneros paid for Jones' silence to protect his nomination to the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, where he was secretary
from 1993 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He is currently the president of the Spanish-language television
network Univision in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' lies to the special prosecutor landed her in the Carswell
Federal Medical Center in Fort Worth where she is serving a
42-month sentence for bank fraud, money laundering and obstruction
of justice.
</P>
<P>
   She agreed to testify against Cisneros in exchange for a
reduction in her sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has testified she underwent detoxification for
prescription drugs and received counseling for depression after she
was in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are seeking to suppress Jones' psychiatric and
medical records, which they say defense lawyers should not have
received under subpoena from prison officials.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend Jones did not waive her right to release the
information.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Bureau of Prisons has opened an internal
investigation to determine whether policy and privacy rights were
violated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The matter has been referred and is currently under
investigation by the Federal Bureau of Prisons,'' said Scott
Wolfson, a spokesman in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who spent four days testifying about the tapes, admitted
she altered and edited 88 recordings to bolster her civil lawsuit
against Cisneros. Jones also said the editing was done on the
advice and with the knowledge of two Bruce Magness and Floyd Holder
of Lubbock, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Holder contradicted that testimony, saying he never knew of
the editing and had not instructed her to alter the recordings and
lie about it under oath to the court.
</P>
<P>
   Holder said he had advised Jones and Magness against sending
Cisneros a letter demanding settlement in the case. Holder argued
that such a demand could be construed as blackmail or extortion.
</P>
<P>
   But he also told the court that Magness had become
``infatuated'' with Jones, whom he had called a ``Marilyn Monroe
look-alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder said that at the time Magness took the case, he had filed
for bankruptcy protection and was ``down on his luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Magness thought the lawsuit would generate a settlement from
Cisneros, and represented a potential bonanza with publishing and
television opportunities, according to Holder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought it was his retirement check,'' Holder said of
Magness.
</P>
<P>
   Magness is expected to testify when the hearing resumes on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Another Lubbock lawyer, Michael Carper, said he declined to file
a civil lawsuit for Jones in 1990 when she came to him with tapes
she said were ``very embarrassing'' to Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jones testified she never spoke with Carper, he said
she came to his office to solicit his help. He said he declined to
pursue the case against Cisneros, which he called ``nothing short
of a shakedown.''

TALLAS NOT GOING ANYWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The suspense is over _ goalie Rob Tallas is staying in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins made a deal to ensure that the Atlanta Thrashers
would bypass Tallas in Friday's expansion draft held Friday at the
FleetCenter. In return, the NHL's newest franchise selected Peter
Ferraro, and the Bruins then sent center Randy Robitaille to the
Thrashers for Ferraro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried not to put too much pressure on myself and not react
until it happened,'' said Tallas, who received a call from his
agent, Jay Fee, some 10 minutes after the proceedings ended.
``Right now I'm excited. I can finally let go of this deep breath
I've been holding. I know now I'm going to have a lot easier
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes for an easier draft for the Bruins Saturday.
President/general manager Harry Sinden said the club was worried
about its depth at goaltender and they would have had to make a
deal for a backup. Most of the available candidates are overpaid
thirtysomethings who don't fit in with the Bruins' youth movement.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins select at No. 21 in the first round, and Friday,
assistant GM Mike O'Connell said the club was exploring the option
of moving up or down.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that in addition to swapping draft picks, the team
could work another kind of deal, perhaps packaging forward Dmitri
Khristich and a draft pick for an established forward to play with
Jason Allison and Sergei Samsonov.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some discussions with a number of teams regarding
either moving down or moving back,'' said O'Connell. ``When it gets
to around our pick or before, it's really one of the first drafts
in a while where there's no clear-cut No. 1, 2, or 3. There are
some question marks. I think when it gets to the 10th pick, we'll
have an idea if we want to move forward if it's still available to
us. When it gets down to around the 15th or 16th pick, we'll have
an idea if we want to move back. There are a few scenarios but how
it plays out, we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said they were very happy to be able to keep Tallas,
who is a restricted free agent this summer. As good a season as
John Grahame had in Providence last year, leading the team to the
Calder Cup championship, it's not known if he's ready to make the
next step.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like Robbie and we like what he's done for us,'' said
O'Connell. ``He's a terrific, terrific kid. We look for him to play
as many games as he did last year or more. Our goaltending on both
sides of Robbie is very strong, with Byron (Dafoe) and with John
Grahame. We didn't want to have to go out and find another
goalie.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said the club's biggest concern is at forward. The team
plans to load up on them Saturday. But he said that could also
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of good prospects, I mean, if you've got three
or four you've got a lot,'' said Sinden. ``With (defenseman)
Jonathan Girard (in junior hockey) and Bobby Allen at BC and
Mattias Timander and Kyle McLaren and Hal Gill, we're pretty good
on defense. That's if both Girard and Allen make it. We think they
will, but you don't know. So, I think if we can find ourselves a
good centerman, we'd be better off to do that. Having said that,
when it comes to your pick, all of sudden there's a defenseman
there and he's much better than the forward available, so you end
up taking the defenseman.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said there might be more diamonds in the rough later in
the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're telling me is whether we were 14th or 28th, it
wouldn't make any difference,'' said Sinden. ``What we're going to
get at 21, we wouldn't get any better at 14, either. Some of the
best choices may be made in the better rounds. Not better players,
but to get a guy in the third round who makes it, there might be a
better opportunity to have it happen this year than in other
years.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Bruins had Steve Heinze rated at No. 15. They
wound up getting him at No. 60 in 1988. Sinden said an even more
dramatic example was Stan Jonathan. In 1975, the Bruins took him
86th overall with their fifth choice. Sinden said he was beating
the drum for them to take him with their second, third, and fourth
picks but he wound up listening to his scouts. ``They took me to
see him play and he was just what I thought we needed, it looked
like the fans would love him,'' said Sinden. ``He was pugnacious
and really fit the times in the '70s with the type of team we had.
We got to the third round and I wanted to take him and (then-head
scout) Gary Darling said, `No, he'll be there.' I said, `If you
guys lose him by waiting, I'm going to lose you.' But they were
right. For some reason, they knew other clubs weren't that high on
him.''

LUCENT BUYS DATA-SWITCHING DEVELOPER FOR $900 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies Inc., the world's leading maker of telephone
equipment, Friday agreed to pay nearly $900 million in stock for
privately-held Nexabit Networks Inc., a developer of high-speed
switches for moving data traffic on telecommunications networks.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase ended a brief bidding war for Nexabit, whose
technology is coveted for its ability to route data swiftly over
the Internet. Analysts said Nexabit will enable Lucent to better
compete against Cisco Systems Inc., which controls the market.
Lucent was reported to have offered between $600 million and $800
million for Nexabit earlier this week, a deal that was rejected by
Mukesh Chatter, Nexabit's founder and chief executive. Chatter
maintained that the company, which has no revenue, was worth more,
prompting the final $900 million price. Analysts predict the
company could have sales of $100 million under Lucent ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Chatter formed the Marlborough, Mass. company in 1997 and
received early funding from individual investors led by Ray Stata,
founder and chairman of Analog Devices Inc. of Norwood, Mass. He
developed a device called a terabit router _ literally, a router
that can move more than one trillion bits of data per second, or 25
times the speed of current equipment _ that is being evaluated by
several companies including Frontier Corp., the fifth-largest
long-distance company and by Road Runner, the second-largest
supplier of high-speed Internet access over cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   The announced acquisition came on the same day that Juniper
Networks Inc., a Nexabit rival whose early investors included
Lucent, launched one of the more spectacular initial public
offerings among telecommunications companies. Juniper stock soared
from its $34 initial offering price to $105 on the first trade
before closing at 98 7/8, a gain of 64 7/8. At day's end, the
Mountain View, Calif. company, had a market capitalization of $4.88
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to get a couple of paydays like Nexabit and Juniper''
chuckled John McQuillan, whose McQuillan Ventures in Concord, Mass.
was an early investor in Avici Systems Inc. of Tewsksbury, Mass.,
another Nexabit competitor. ``This deal with Nexabit strengthens
Lucent's hand in selling against Cisco because they can now offer a
broad array of products and services to telephone carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement with Nexabit, Lucent will issue about 14
million shares for Nexabit, which last summer received $25 million
in financing from Hambecht &AMP; Quist, Fidelity Ventures, and Vulcan
Ventures, a venture capital firm owned by Paul Allen, co-founder of
Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Lucent's closing price Friday of 63 11/16, the Nexabit
purchase was worth $891.63 million.
</P>
<P>
   The hefty price tags for Nexabit and Juniper are due to industry
expectations that vast amounts of new equipment will be needed to
manage the spiraling demand for data traffic over the networks of
telephone companies and Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   To insure that trillions of bytes of data are routed quickly and
reliably, the major telephone carrier are looking for the next
generation of equipment from big companies like Cisco, Lucent, and
Nortel, as well as from smaller companies like Juniper, and several
new companies developing high-speed routers such as Avici and
Ironbridge Networks Inc. of Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   They are all after an emerging market of Internet-based routers
and switches that is expected to soar to $5.5 billion in 2003 from
$169 million this year, according to Ryan Hankin and Kenty, a San
Francisco-based market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building the next telephone company infrastruture means
producing high-speed equipment that rarely fails and can still work
in the event of earthquakes,'' said Anthony Lavia, Ironbridge
president and chief executive, whose 120-employee company recently
received $33 million in venture financing to develop its own
terabit router.

   WALLULA, Wash. _ Khamkong Baninthivong, a Laotian immigrant who
has quietly worked for 13 and a half years as a meat trimmer at the
IBP plant here in eastern Washington, voted to strike because she
feels her wage _ $8.28 an hour, 10 cents more than her hourly wage
at the plant seven years ago _ is simply too low.
</P>
<P>
   Josefina Alfaro, originally from El Salvador, a U.S. citizen as
of two years ago, voted to strike IBP, the world's largest producer
of beef and pork products, because she thinks the union will win.
``But even if not,'' said the 45-year-old Mrs. Alfaro, a meat
cutter walking the picket line, ``it's worth the risk because there
are other jobs out there. A lot of places _ hospitals, plants _
they're all looking for people.''
</P>
<P>
   And Almir Biscevic, 23, a Bosnian Muslim who fled his
war-wracked country with his family three years ago, voted for the
strike earlier this month even though he was not quite sure how it
all worked. ``When I first heard, I was, `Strike? What is a
strike?''' said Biscevic in the English he is struggling to master.
``But now I am for it. There's a lot wrong inside that plant.
There's not safety. There's not respect.''
</P>
<P>
   What began as a wildcat strike earlier this month at the plant,
where about 90 percent of the 1,500 workers are immigrants, has
quickly mushroomed into a test of wills between IBP and a feisty
union whose action is now sanctioned by the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the work stoppage, approved by a vote of 847-291
in early June, is a notable example of community organizing among
workers who cannot even communicate in a common tongue. Rallies
here have featured speeches in English and Spanish, with pauses for
the words to be translated into Lao, Vietnamese and Serbo-Croatian.
As Maria Martinez, a strike leader, put it: ``It's not so hard to
get people together, because `Enough is enough' is something you
can understand in any language.''
</P>
<P>
   But the successful start of the strike also highlights some
larger factors clearly at work here in Wallula, including the
receptivity that many immigrants feel toward union activity and
their growing confidence that, with a strong economy and many
employers anxious for workers, the potential benefits of pressing
for better wages and working conditions outweigh any risks.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it an isolated example. This week, for instance, workers
at the nation's largest textile complex voted to unionize,
according to unofficial returns, a sweeping victory for organized
labor after unsuccessful efforts stretching across decades, and one
that leaders there attributed in part to the growing number of
immigrant workers at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this year, winning the biggest unionization drive in
half a century, the Service Employees International Union earned
the right to represent nearly 75,000 home-care workers in the Los
Angeles area. Many of those workers, who care for the elderly and
disabled, are immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the most significant victories labor has seen in the
past 10 years have been among immigrant workers,'' said Kate
Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research at Cornell
University, pointing to the recent votes as well as ones by
asbestos-removal workers and janitors in several big cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons is simply that immigrants still tend to
live in communities with others who work with them,'' she said.
``Most white workers today who aren't recent immigrants, they're
much more scattered in terms of where they live. In that sense,
they're much harder to organize.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the workers come from countries with some tradition of
union activity and may themselves have been leaders of such
efforts, said Fernando Gapasin, an expert on immigrant labor at the
University of California at Los Angeles. ``Some of these workers
are very heads-up about how to organize.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, some major unions, with leaders who came of age in
battles where there were no language barriers among workers, have
been slow to respond to the changing dynamics posed by the influx
of immigrant workers. Gapasin cited that as one major reason why
union membership overall has continued to decline in this country,
to under 14 percent of the workforce today from about 35 percent in
the mid-1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unions are certainly developing strategies to deal with
multicultural workforces, but many have been slow to do so,''
Gapasin said. ``It is a weakness for labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those problems are in evidence at the strike here in
Wallula, an agricultural town near the confluence of the Snake and
Columbia Rivers. The action clearly began among the rank-and-file,
and was endorsed only belatedly by Teamsters leaders higher up the
organizational chain, who waited for several days to sanction an
official strike vote.
</P>
<P>
   When a Teamsters official showed up on June 6, two days after
several hundred workers had staged a walkout at the plant, a crowd
of angry IBP employees unleashed a torrent of complaints about what
they felt was a lack of support from union leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The heckling grew so bad that at one point the official, Al
Hobart, secretary-treasurer of Local 760 of Yakima, responded in
kind. ``One of the major issues in your negotiations has been
respect,'' he told the workers, according to a report in The
Tri-City Herald, the newspaper here. ``You cannot get what you
don't give. You have shown me very little today.''
</P>
<P>
   Respect is what many workers here say they do want to gain from
their strike, and many pointed to what they said were abysmal
working conditions at the plant, a hulking concrete complex set
amid the farmlands, where hundreds of cattle are shipped in for
slaughter daily and the powerful smell of dead meat hangs in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   The plant, one of 48 around the country owned by IBP, turns out
meat products for human and pet consumption, and also by-products
of the slaughter that are used for soap and glue.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the workers on the picket line complained not only of
low pay, but also of unsanitary conditions and injuries they
suffered on line like cuts, and hand and joint pains stemming from
what they said was constant pressure to speed up production.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The chain, it turns very, very fast,'' said Kien Nguyen, a
55-year-old flank-steak trimmer, referring to the conveyor belt on
which pieces of meat come to his station. ``Too fast. The safety is
very low.'' Nguyen, originally from Vietnam, used to work as a
newspaper deliverer in Orange County, Calif., and came to Wallula
two years ago when a friend told him about jobs available at the
plant here. He makes $8.28 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   A 40-year-old Bosnian man, who came here as a refugee just a few
months ago and was one of the few striking workers who would not
give his name, said: ``I know what is hard work. Here, they treat
you like a dog. If you get hurt they give you pills and they say,
`What, you can't handle it?'''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for IBP at its corporate headquarters in Dakota
Dunes, S.D., Don Willoughby, said the workers' complaints about
conditions were ``typical union rhetoric'' used as part of the
bargaining process for higher wages. The company has offered a
$1.57 an hour pay increase over the next 4 1/2 years, to a
plant-wide average of $10.41, with 82 cents per-hour effective
immediately, but the union negotiating committee has rejected the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Willoughby said the company paid scrupulous attention to safety
concerns, though he turned down a reporter's request for a tour of
the plant, which is running on partial operations with about 400
non-striking workers and supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing against your writing, but our experiences with
members of the news media have been less than satisfactory when
we've given tours,'' he said. ``People like to visualize the cow
out in the pasture and the steak on the plate, but they really
don't want to visualize what goes on in-between.''
</P>
<P>
   The company did make six non-striking workers available for
interviews, in the presence of a company personnel manager. All
said the plant was safe and the company fair, but none would allow
their names to be used for fear, they said, of union retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, union activity among immigrant workers is nothing
new, especially among immigrants. ``This is almost `The Jungle'
revisited,'' said Harley Shaiken, a labor specialist at the
University of California at Berkeley, referring to Upton Sinclair's
classic expose of abuses in the meat industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the turn of the century, immigrant workers speaking Slavic,
Russian and Polish were at the core of organizing efforts,'' he
said, ``and at the end of the century it's immigrant workers
speaking Spanish, Laotian, Vietnamese.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is already looking for new workers, but many workers
on strike pointed to local economic conditions in predicting they
would prevail with a better contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are they going to replace 1,000 people just like that?''
said 38-year-old Guadalupe Alvarado, a cutter who makes $10.43 an
hour after 14 years at the plant. ``It takes a year to really train
someone. It's not easy to replace us. They know that. They won't
admit it, but they know it.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On its face, it's hard to imagine a less appealing
investment: the No. 2 company in a cyclical, capital-intensive
business, rapidly losing market share to newer, more nimble
competitors not subject to its strict federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it could become one of the most intriguing investment
opportunities of the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The company is the NASDAQ Stock Market. At its board meeting
next month, NASDAQ's parent, the National Association of Securities
Dealers, will consider a proposal to issue NASDAQ stock to some of
the 6,000 brokerage firms that make up the association and the
5,000 companies whose stocks are traded there. Later, NASDAQ shares
might be sold to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thinking is to open up our stock markets to investment
from participants and eventually the public, so they can
participate in our growth and financial success and so we can raise
the needed funds to grow and continue to modernize,'' Frank G.
Zarb, the NASD chairman, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The precedent comes from Down Under. In October, the Australian
Stock Exchange converted from mutual ownership to a publicly traded
company. Its shares have since risen 135 percent, six times the
gain in the All Ordinaries, the bellwether Australian index.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange has also considered public
ownership. But the tectonic shifts taking place in the financial
markets worldwide have put particular pressure on NASDAQ. Two years
ago, the implementation of new rules for handling orders for NASDAQ
trades _ a result of the settlement of the government's charges of
collusion among NASDAQ dealers _ gave rise to a growing number of
electronic trading systems.
</P>
<P>
   Those private, for-profit electronic systems used inexpensive
technology to take away a significant share of NASDAQ's trading
volume. Seeing their advantages, big Wall Street firms began to
invest in the fledgling electronic markets. Suddenly, the interests
of the NASDAQ Stock Market and the brokerage firms that make up the
NASD diverged.
</P>
<P>
   Realigning those interests, therefore, is what is leading NASDAQ
down the path toward an initial public offering. And by offering
shares to traded companies, NASDAQ would have an incentive for new
listings, and for its current listings to stay put.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a NASDAQ IPO has generated excitement, much of which
can be traced to the financial reward that attaches itself to those
three magic letters. But will that make NASDAQ a good investment?
</P>
<P>
   It could, if NASDAQ uses the proceeds to improve its technology,
pay for vigorous oversight and forge greater links with overseas
markets. That will keep it ahead of competitors, whose ranks,
history shows, are likely to thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1850, there were 250 stock exchanges in the United
States,'' said Frank E. Baxter, chairman of Jefferies Group, the
brokerage firm, and head of the NASDAQ committee studying the
public offering proposal. ``We're in a small bubble where they're
proliferating, but that goes against all of history.''
</P>
<P>
   NASDAQ recognizes, however, that it probably has a fairly small
window in which to act. Baxter adds, ``I would say there is a mood
of urgency.''

   PRISTINA Yugoslavia _ Refugees are flocking back to Kosovo,
which has been increasingly plagued by deaths and violence, leading
the top NATO commander to call for international police to keep
order in the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is doing all that it can to grip the situation on the
ground. We're very much aware of the challenges in an environment
in which whatever authority there was has departed and new
structures and institutions must be formed,'' Gen. Wesley Clark
told Reuters in an interview in which he called for an acceleration
of plans to bring in U.N. police. A force of 3,000 is planned, but
it is expected to take three months for the full force to arrive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some 48,000 refugees crossed into Kosovo Thursday alone, Paula
Ghedini, spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
said Friday. Some 300,000 of nearly 1 million Albanian refugees
have returned since NATO intervened two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one of the largest spontaneous returns of refugees
we have seen in 25 years,'' Ms. Ghedini said at a news conference.
The Albanian border town of Kukes, once choked with over 100,000
refugees, is already empty, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of refugees is placing enormous pressure on the
peacekeeping force, which in the absence of any civilian law
enforcement agencies is having to perform policing duties along
with military duties.
</P>
<P>
   In village after village, as Albanians have returned to their
homes, Serbs have fled, and houses have burned and looted.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 16 civilian deaths in Kosovo in the last 36
hours, one of which occurred when U.S. Marines of the 26th
Expeditionary Unit shot and killed a civilian in Gniljane Friday
when their unit came under fire from the former Serbian police
headquarters. No American soldiers were injured.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton addressed the issue of violence, particularly
that by returning Albanians against Serbs, in a news conference
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is not letting it happen,'' he said. ``We're doing what
we can to stop it, and I'm concerned about it.'' He added, ``I'm
not particularly surprised, after what they've been through,''
referring to the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops were out in evident force on the streets and in the
suburbs of the provincial capital Friday, after a night of looting
and killing that shook the residents of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Richard Dannatt, a British officer here, said, ``We
are aiming to provide a secure environment and will hold the fort
until the U.N. can take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Michael Jackson, the commander of the NATO peacekeeping
force in Kosovo, KFOR, meanwhile, went to calm some 200 local Serbs
who gathered to protest the violence in the Serb suburb of Kosovo
Polje.
</P>
<P>
   Together with Sergio Vieira de Mello, the special representative
of the U.N. secretary general in Kosovo, Jackson pledged to protect
all the citizens of Kosovo equally and urged the Serbs not to flee
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that you are concerned and worried,'' said Jackson,
speaking to the crowd from the steps of the Orthodox church in
Kosovo Polje.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have now 22,000 soldiers in Kosovo. In one month, I will
have double that number. Every day more are coming in, and you will
soon start to see a police force in Kosovo. Every day the security
forces of KFOR are becoming stronger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His words brought unhappy murmurs from the crowd and a few
grumbles of ``occupiers'' from the more disconsolate. But the
majority were hanging on the general's words, desperate for some
assurance of security after several highly publicized slayings of
ethnic Serbs in the city in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One woman, a medical worker who only gave her first name,
Marica, said she had fled to the town of Nis in Serbia, but then
returned after hearing the general give a similar speech last week.
``I understand English; I heard Jackson say he would make it
safe,'' she explained. ``But it is not safe, KFOR is doing nothing
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The British police refused to release details of the murders
they had recorded, but said they had been at the scenes of the 14
killings that occurred in their sector in the 24 hours prior to the
morning press briefing.
</P>
<P>
   In the morgue of the city hospital, Nexhmi Kameri, an Albanian
medical technician, mournfully turned the pages of his register. He
had admitted 16 bodies in the last 24 hours he said, five of them
newborn babies who had died on delivery. The others were all men,
almost equally split between Serbs and Albanians. He estimated that
11 had been killed. ``With both hot and cold weapons,'' he said.
``It's horrible to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Looters and car thieves are taking advantage of the vacuum of
law enforcement. NATO military police have recorded 196 serious
crimes over the last two weeks and have started filling the
prisons, left empty by the Serbian police when they evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The clashes are expected to get worse as the ranks of returning
refugees swell. Refugees were on the move from camps in the south
of Albania, from Montenegro and from Turkey. They will require
food, medicine and shelter, because thousands will return to find
their houses burned. Ms. Ghedini cited just one settlement near Pec
in western Kosovo, where 150 returning refugee families had been
found living in their cars or in the open.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The British said that in their sector they are trying to contain
the violence without excess force. ``We have a society in shock,
that has lost its infrastructure, and suffered greatly. We have to
be firm but fair,'' said Dannatt at a press briefing. ``We have had
a number of murders reported, it all stems from tensions between
Albanians and Serbs,'' he said.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   He avoided a question on whether the force was considering
shooting looters and answered with the question: ``Would you shoot
looters here?'' The police were, however, increasing spot checks
around town and conducting extensive patrolling, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians and Serbs alike are nervous; the Albanians of robbery
and looting, &UR;  &LR; the Serbs of murders that they feel are designed to
terrorize them into leaving the province.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo Polje, they said, they felt they were on a knife edge,
poised to flee at any moment. They had gathered to try to make a
joint decision on what to do, some in the crowd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking KFOR to protect us because in two or three days
it will not be possible to talk to these people anymore, they will
be gone and there will only be Albanians,'' Momcilo Trajkovic, a
moderate Serb politician and leader of the Serbian Resistance
Movement, told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``But those who go from here will lose everything, their houses
and families,'' he said. He urged people to find the courage to
stay. ``Our biggest task is to stay here, maybe we will have
casualties, but we have to stay in our houses and on our land. Our
place is not in Serbia, but here.''

   The California Supreme Court has ruled that journalists' use of
hidden cameras in a workplace can be an invasion of privacy,
upholding a verdict against ABC News over a story about telephone
psychics.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous opinion, announced on Thursday, reversed a 1997
appeals court ruling that had overturned a $1.2 million jury
verdict award to Mark Sanders, an employee of a company that sold
telephone psychic readings.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' conversations with an ABC employee posing as a
co-worker were videotaped and broadcast in a 1993 ``PrimeTime
Live'' report, purporting to show that the psychics did not take
their jobs seriously and were cheating gullible callers paying
$3.95 a minute to get advice.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court had ruled that because his conversations could
have been overheard by other employees, Sanders' privacy had not
been violated. But the state Supreme Court ruled that ``in an
office of other workplace to which the general public does not have
unfettered access, employees may enjoy a limited but legitimate''
right to expect that private conversations with co-workers will not
be secretly videotaped and broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The case was returned to the appeals court for any decision on
damages. The state Supreme Court said that for a plaintiff to win
damages, the invasion of privacy would have to be ``highly
offensive to a reasonable person.'' But the court said it ``took no
view on the offensiveness or inoffensiveness of defendants'
conduct'' in Sanders' case.
</P>
<P>
   The court also said its ruling did not mean it was always
illegal for news organizations to record events secretly in places
of work.
</P>
<P>
   Television news executives have often argued that the use of
secret cameras can sometimes be the only way to expose malfeasance.
The California court indirectly noted this, saying that a news
organization could defend itself against liability by using the
offensiveness standard to argue that the privacy infringement
committed was ``justified by the legitimate motive of gathering
news.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC, a subsidiary of Walt Disney Co., said it was considering an
appeal of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   But Neville Johnson, a Los Angeles lawyer who has brought
several suits against news organizations over the use of hidden
cameras, said the ruling had ``firmly established the right to
privacy in the workplace,'' at least in a workplace not open to the
general public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be different if you taped workers in a 7-Eleven or a
department store, for example,'' Johnson said.

   The first word Thursday night at New York's Four Seasons, which
was celebrating 160 seasons as the setting of as many transactions
as the stock exchange floor, came from the architect Philip
Johnson, about why the restaurant and his design for it had
survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have good management and good food; all I could do was
give them the background,'' he said on the way in. Johnson,
regularly found at a Grill Room (not Pool Room _ more on this
later) corner table for lunch, soon agreed that he was too modest.
``Of course, I had something to do with it. I'm quite a good
architect.''
</P>
<P>
   The next words came from Steven T. Florio, chief of Conde Nast,
and Marvin R. Shanken, owner of Cigar Aficionado and Wine Spectator
magazines, both recalling Christmas staff lunches there so fondly
that a writer who was listening all but asked them for a job.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Brown, the founder of Talk Media, gamely described some of
her company's efforts to meld books, movies and a magazine, by
saying, ``Synergy is a guy in the next office with the same
tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   After further words from movie stars, politicians and business
leaders like Ronald O. Perelman, Ellen Barkin, Barry Diller, Bruce
Wasserstein, Steven Rattner, David N. Dinkins, Edward I. Koch,
Bianca Jagger, Jonathan M. Tisch and Henry R. Kravis, came one more
word, from Graydon Carter, Vanity Fair editor and a co-host, with
Edgar Bronfman Jr. Carter, his gray crest bobbing above the Grill
Room crowd, recalled his Time magazine farewell lunch in 1983 _
$1,000 for four, on an expense account. ``We were so young we
thought the Pool Room was hot,'' he said. &QL;

   Dennis D. Dammerman, the longtime General Electric finance chief
who recently became chief executive of the relentlessly profitable
GE Capital Services unit, has a no-nonsense, tough-guy reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday in a talk at the Japan Society in Manhattan, he
took pains to speak warmly about Japan, its economic reforms and
its companies, in which GE Capital has invested about $14 billion
lately.
</P>
<P>
   When a Japanese reporter dared to ask, though, whether rising
unemployment there was spurring nationalistic resentment toward
companies like GE that are going on shopping sprees, it was the
rougher Dammerman who responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, my Manhattan office is in 30 Rockefeller Plaza,'' he shot
back, calling to mind the 1989 purchase of the building by the
Mitsubishi Estate Co. as a flush Japan collected trophy properties
across America. ``There was a little resentment here, too.''
(``Thirty Rock'' returned to American hands in 1996.)
</P>
<P>
   Dammerman's more measured response was that he did not expect an
anti-American backlash among Japanese consumers. &QL;

   Papa's got a brand new moneybag. For a concert Saturday night in
New York, James Brown, the Godfather of Soul, had plans to welcome
on stage David Pullman, whose Pullman Group investment firm raised
about $30 million for Brown by issuing bonds based on future
royalties. Besides becoming the Underwriter of Soul, Pullman has
sold bonds for David Bowie and Ashford &AMP; Simpson. &QL;

<P>
   When Bruce Berkowitz, chief financial officer for Gotham Capital
Management, a Manhattan-based hedge fund, was arrested last week on
charges of defrauding his company of up to $5 million, another
investment fund manager and firm suffered, too.
</P>
<P>
   David P. Berkowitz, co-founder of the $550 million Gotham
Partners fund, also in Manhattan, heard plenty from worried
investors and managers of companies in their portfolio _ including
Jonas P. Lee, chief executive of Giftcertificates.com. Lee got a
phone call at 2 a.m. from a friend warning him that his lead
investor was in deep trouble, then checked the news on line to
discover that it was someone else's trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ackman, the other co-founder of Gotham Partners, and
Berkowitz have sent letters to his investors, who include the Ziff
family, saying that it was the (italics)other(end italics) Gotham
and the (italics)other(end italics) Berkowitz.
</P>
<P>
   Gotham Partners' Berkowitz has also suffered from confusion with
another David Berkowitz, the serial killer known as Son of Sam,
whose name is again making headlines with the coming release of the
Spike Lee movie ``Summer of Sam.''

EUROPEAN, LATIN AMERICAN TRADING BLOCS MEET 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ In an effort to increase trade and gain
a counterweight to American global economic dominance, leaders of
the world's second- and third-largest trading blocs are to meet
here this weekend and early next week in a first-ever Latin
American-European Summit that has already proved contentious on
several basic issues.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering will bring together heads of state from 33 Latin
American and Caribbean countries and their counterparts from the 15
nations of the European Union. The centerpiece of the meeting is
the prospect for negotiations for a free-trade agreement between
the European Union and MERCOSUR, the six-nation South American
bloc.
</P>
<P>
   With a population of more than 200 million and a combined
economy of more than $1 trillion a year, MERCOSUR is the largest
trading bloc after the North American Free Trade Agreement group,
composed of the United States, Canada and Mexico, and the European
Union. MERCOSUR's full members are Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and
Uruguay. Bolivia and Chile are associate members.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are really going to be two meetings going on, one with
all of Latin America and the Caribbean present, which will be
largely rhetorical,'' said Helio Jaguaribe of the Institute for
Political and Social Studies, a research group here. ``But there
will also be a meeting within the meeting between Europe and
MERCOSUR, where the real business will take place.''
</P>
<P>
   For Latin America, the conference offers a rare opportunity to
gain concessions from the United States and Europe by playing them
off against each other.
</P>
<P>
   At the December 1994 Summit of the Americas in Miami, the United
States and 32 Latin American and Caribbean nations agreed to
establish a Free Trade Area of the Americas and set 2005 as a
deadline. But that process has stalled, and many nations in the
region have shifted their focus to reaching agreements among
themselves and with European and Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the Brazilian point of view, we are not putting too much
pressure on the hemispheric free-trade area idea,'' Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, the president of Brazil, said in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the European-Latin American summit meeting emerged
from a visit to Brazil in 1997 by Jacques Chirac, the president of
France. The notion was endorsed by Brazil and its MERCOSUR
partners, who see stronger ties to Europe as offering the only
possible counterweight to the United States' historical hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   But as talks for an agenda for the conference advanced, France
has proved to be the main obstacle to beginning formal negotiations
aimed at a free-trade pact. The MERCOSUR group wants nothing
excluded, while the French, fearing that a flood of meat, grain,
sugar and even wine from MERCOSUR would ruin its heavily subsidized
farmers, have been insisting that agriculture be excluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe has to make a decision,'' Cardoso said. ``If it really
believes that it has a role to play, it has to take into account
that the interests of other parts of the world include
agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Europe insists on its current agricultural policies, he
said, ``Well, then we always have the Free Trade Area of the
Americas.''
</P>
<P>
   The French position has been resisted both by Germany, the
European Union's biggest member, and Portugal and Spain, which have
built on their historical linguistic and cultural ties to become,
along with Britain and Italy, large investors in the region.
``Europe must understand that it is strategic for its global
position to deepen relations with MERCOSUR,'' Portugal's prime
minister, Antonio Guterres, said recently.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday, the European Union agreed
to grant its delegations here the power to authorize formal talks.
MERCOSUR officials said that step was no guarantee that there would
be success here.
</P>
<P>
   Had Europe failed to grant that authority, it would have created
``a very awkward, very difficult, incomprehensible situation,''
Manuel Marin, a Spaniard who is the European Union's top expert in
Latin American affairs, told reporters. ``I can't propose marriage
and then 20 days before the wedding say, `I don't like you,''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been some disagreement about a timetable for
negotiations. The Latin Americans are eager to begin talks
immediately and want to set a deadline of 2005 to coincide with the
schedule of the hemispheric free-trade talks, while the French have
been suggesting a delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the United States, the best thing that could happen would
be a postponement'' of talks between Europe and MERCOSUR, said
Gilberto Dupas, coordinator of the International Affairs division
of the Institute for Advanced Studies at the University of Sao
Paulo. ``The tracks are already being laid for the Free Trade Area
of the Americas, and once you have that in place, it is easy for
the locomotive to start moving.''

IT IS QUITE EVIDENT LEWIS USED DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- When we thought it was all over, Donna Harris-Lewis
said she had proven that her husband, Reggie, did not do drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon me.
</P>
<P>
   Three people, none of whom knew each other, all testified under
oath in either pre-trial depositions or in court that they were
present and ``doing'' drugs with Reggie Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   One, Wayne Brown, a classmate of Lewis's at Northeastern, said
he not only did cocaine with Reggie, but also provided it to him.
Harris-Lewis later labeled Brown a loser.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Lebeaux, who worked for the Celtics when Lewis was on the
team, said in his deposition that he did marijuana with Lewis and
two women.
</P>
<P>
   Businessman Ronald J. Marks said he witnessed Lewis sniffing a
``shiny white powdered substance'' in a public restroom at a Saugus
pizza parlor. Lewis was a Celtic at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Losers? I don't think so. I give them all the credit in the
world for standing up under the toughest of circumstances, with
absolutely nothing to gain, to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Who in their right mind would be willing to testify to being
involved with drugs?
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, most business professionals or athletes who may
have been caught up in the cocaine vogue of the '80s and early '90s
have that behind them today. They've moved on to have families and
potentially rewarding careers. They are reluctant to admit today to
any unlawful activities in their past.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement comes from Bob Long, former Massachusetts State
Police detective and president of LCF Associates of Braintree, the
investigative firm working with attorney William Dailey on the
Lewis litigation. ``It is very difficult to get people to come
forward in any type of drug investigation,'' said Long, who
declined any further comment because this Lewis farce may have
another day in court.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was last Sunday morning. The setting was beautiful. A
sun-filled Nantucket morning, sitting under a tent enjoying
breakfast just yards from the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcaster Bob Lobel was speaking openly of his personal
frustration in this matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the most frustrating thing I have had to deal with in
all of my years in television,'' said Lobel, who has been one hell
of a reporter for WBZ over the years. ``You know what the truth is.
You talk to people who were there with Reggie. Did that (cocaine)
with him. They tell you all about it, and when you ask them to come
forward, they fold on you. They don't want to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one guy, a friend of mine, a top guy, very successful,
who was there when Reggie was doing it, but he wouldn't come
forward. I told him we'd put him in a disguise. Or we would put him
behind a screen where you would just see his shadow, and hear his
voice, but not see him. He still wouldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only God knows if cocaine killed Reggie Lewis, but only a fool
would think that sometime in his life he didn't use drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie was a happy-go-lucky, easygoing guy. He was easy to meet
and easy to like. There is no reason for anyone to make up stories
about him, or reporters to want to work on stories about this case.
</P>
<P>
   To date, some of the luckiest guys in the world are Lewis's
former Celtic teammates, who came within a whisker of being brought
into this case to have their own use of drugs, and partying with
women, put on public record.
</P>
<P>
   There was this one chilling line from a former Celtics' wife
(off the record, of course) telling someone, ``In our house,
cocaine flowed as freely as wine.'' She is no longer married to the
player and couldn't be induced to come forward to expose the secret
lives of several players from that era.
</P>
<P>
   There was a female ``groupie'' from this era, who was part of
the drug/sex scene, now married with children. Her family does not
know of her past. She fainted when asked to testify.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have written from the beginning that, at minimum, this is a
$17 million fraud. When Reggie Lewis filled out an insurance form
that covered his contract, he was asked if he had ``ever'' done
marijuana, cocaine, etc. He answered no. There is substantial
evidence that that answer was a lie, which makes it a fraud. The
Equitable Life Insurance Co. can now open the case and reclaim $5
million from the Celtics. We will see how the officers of that
company respond, on behalf of their stockholders, who were
defrauded.
</P>
<P>
   The other insurance companies can't get their $12 million back
from Donna Harris-Lewis. The two-year statute of limitations has
run out on the money, and even though it now appears to have been
fraudulently obtained, does not have to be returned. That's one law
our great legislators should rewrite. How could they ever put into
law something that says if you can deceive the insurance company
and survive two years, you can keep the money? Ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week, I spent some time with Boston College athletic
director Gene DeFilippo. On Tuesday, he asked how I thought the
case was going to come out. I said two doctors would be not guilty,
Dr. Mudge would get a hung jury. Not bad, huh?
</P>
<P>
   Let me tell you why. I'm a realist. When I saw the makeup of the
jury, I thought I knew the answer. For either side to win, it had
to get 13 of 15 votes. That, in my mind, wasn't going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The other two doctors never should have been brought into this.
The judge said as much at the halfway mark, but said he would let
them stay in the trial because he didn't want that to be used as a
reason for an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my take on Mudge. Nice guy. Terrific doctor. Wanted to do
all he could for Lewis. Tried to make it look like he could play
again, even though the Celtics had already told Lewis that he
wouldn't be playing for them the next season. Lewis isn't dead
because of Mudge.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Donna Harris-Lewis has said this case was not about the money.
She wanted to prove that Reggie didn't do drugs. She said after the
trial that she proved Reggie didn't do drugs. But her attorney
said, ``We'll be back to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   She has just tied up a Massachusetts courtroom _ and the lives
of many people _ for eight weeks at the cost of hundreds of
thousands. She will still need to get 13 of 15 votes if she goes
through it again, and hopefully, enough jurors on the next case
will have the courage to do what enough of these jurors did _ find
Mudge not negligent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many of his former teammates can continue to sweat
bullets. And many who knew Reggie's other life, who were on the
verge of stepping forward, will have enough character and courage
to do so the next time around.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, some alleged experts said there would probably
be a settlement rather than another trial. If I were Mudge, I
wouldn't give Harris-Lewis anything. She said it wasn't about the
money, and as long as some people are still willing to speak up and
tell the truth, she'll never get 13 of 15 votes, either.

A CULTURE OF TRIAL, DESPITE ERROR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27)

 (Attn: N.H., Calif., Md.)   (Eds: This is the sidebar story to BIZ-MANAGEMENT-ENRON)  
 (af)  
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lou L. Pai's last assignment at Enron had all the hallmarks of a
career maker.
</P>
<P>
   As the chairman and chief executive of Enron Energy Services,
Pai led the company's charge to become the nation's premier
marketer of electricity to residential customers as states like
California deregulated their utility industries.
</P>
<P>
   Oops. After an intensive, two-year campaign that sent Enron's
stock on a roller-coaster ride, the company has declared retail
electric sales a dead end for now.
</P>
<P>
   A career breaker? Not at Enron, said Pai, 51. Top executives
concluded that the company had just been premature. ``You're going
to make mistakes,'' Pai said. ``You can't sit there and punish
people for trying.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt that the company's senior officers have known
failure. Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's president, recalled that he
and Pai were part of group in 1990 that developed a financial
instrument called a Gas Trust, intended to let investors speculate
on natural-gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   Enron promoted the trust around the country, but quickly
abandoned it when investors showed little interest.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of being reined in by his superiors, Pai has been
encouraged to push ahead and take even more risks. His unit is
spending heavily to persuade large industrial and commercial
customers to sign up for long-term contracts under which Enron will
supply them with low-cost electricity and natural gas, along with
an array of services to cut their energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   The start-up costs are expected to reach $300 million by the end
of the year, and Pai hopes that the new business will begin to
generate operating profits by fall.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the gamble much bigger than Enron's retailing
efforts, which began in April 1996, when the company sent 30
salespeople to set up an office in Peterborough, N.H., a village of
5,300. New Hampshire had a pilot program to introduce competition
into electricity sales, and as part of it, Enron beat back a score
of rivals to be selected as Peterborough's new energy supplier.
</P>
<P>
   The company then spent $30 million on television commercials _
some featuring happy customers in Peterborough _ intended to make
itself a household name. By the fall of 1997, Pai and his group had
carried the banner to California, which as the first state to fully
deregulate would be a much bigger market to tap.
</P>
<P>
   Enron sent out hundreds of thousands of fliers offering
customers two weeks' free electricity, and it blanketed the state
with advertising. But the response was tepid: The company ended up
with about 50,000 customers, or 1 percent of a potential pool of
five million accounts.
</P>
<P>
   After spending $15 million in a few months, Enron pulled out of
California _ and left Peterborough, too, as New Hampshire's
deregulation efforts flagged. ``It's a marketing game,'' explained
Pai, who studied economics at the University of Maryland and worked
at Conoco as a trader before joining Enron in 1987. ``We're not a
marketing company. That's not our expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   His current thrust _ going after larger customers to supply
electricity and natural gas in big quantities _ is more familiar
ground for Enron. But there are challenges: knitting together
disparate services to provide energy audits, billing and
centralized heating and cooling controls for hotel chains or sports
stadiums or a company's factories.
</P>
<P>
   There is also ample competition _ and the certainty that for all
the leeway Enron affords, the market's discipline will be swift and
severe if Pai and his group have miscalculated on the long-term
supply agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't execute,'' he said, ``we're toast.''

CAMPBELL WARNS OF LOWER EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SHOLNN FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Acknowledging more trouble in its soup business, Campbell Soup
Co. said Friday that it would not meet analysts' earnings
expectations for this quarter and that it planned to reorganize its
soup operations.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell warned that its earnings for the fiscal quarter ending
July 31 would be 8 cents to 10 cents a share below the consensus
estimate of 38 cents a share from analysts surveyed by First Call
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell also said that it planned to combine its Canadian
business with its U.S. soup and sauce operations to create a North
American division.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the reorganization, Mark Leckie, the president of the
Campbell's domestic soup division, will leave the company. He will
be succeeded by F. Martin Thrasher, the company's president of
European and Canadian operations who has worked at Campbell 11
years. Thrasher headed the soup division from 1992 to early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company said it would make unspecified cuts to
save $18 million to $25 million a year. The action could result in
an after-tax charge as high as $45 million in the current fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, based in Camden, N.J., attributed its the earnings
problem to reduced soup purchases from grocery stores. One reason,
analysts said, was that Campbell had discontinued its traditional
end-of-quarter promotional discounts on soups. Grocers used to buy
large quantities during the sale and warehouse them, but now they
were reducing their inventories. Campbell expects shipments to drop
10 percent in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the company announced a similar earnings decline
because of the same problem.
</P>
<P>
   The stock was down 50 cents, closing at $41.9375; it has fallen
25 percent the last six months, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index has risen 7.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Leckie, who headed the company's domestic soup operations _
three-quarters of the company _ was brought on less than a year and
a half ago to turn around the soup business, which has changed
leaders repeatedly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wonder if leading the soup business is such a
difficult problem _ is it the person or is it the business
itself?'' said Eric Katzman, a food industry analyst at Merrill
Lynch. ``To once again change the head of the soup business, seems
to suggest other problems in the health of that business going
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Other industry analysts also said they saw Campbell's long-term
goal of growing the domestic soup business 3 to 4 percent as too
ambitious. Campbell already dominates three-quarters of the
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Campbell's expectations that led Wall Street to
unrealistic earnings expectations,'' said Nomi Ghez, an analyst for
Goldman, Sachs. ``The company has been trying to stimulate growth.
They've been trying very hard with new products and product line
extensions. The problem is that the category is already big, and
Campbell already dominates, so it's hard to increase market
share.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Buckley, Campbell's spokesman, said the company would
continue to innovate its soup products. In the fall, the company
will begin to sell ready-to-serve tomato soup in a plastic package,
as well as a soup-to-go product in a bowl that can be used in
microwaves, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, Campbell's chief executive, Dale
Morrison, acknowledged that the company had had a challenging year.
In January, the company announced a plan to reduce inefficiencies
on its manufacturing side that would save about $150 million a
year, starting in its fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison predicted the company would regain earnings momentum
next year.

 &HT;    Falcons sign first-round choice for $5.6 million
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Patrick Kerney's dream of getting paid to play
lacrosse officially died Friday. After signing a five-year contract
worth $5.6 million, however, the Falcons' first-round draft choice
is smiling all the way to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5, 269-pound defensive end, who went to the
University of Virginia on a lacrosse scholarship and then walked on
the football team, got a signing bonus of $1.52 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of it will go straight into savings . . . but I've got a
new house at Lake Lanier, and I guess maybe I'll buy a boat,'' he
said. ``The Major Indoor Lacrosse League is paying a lot better
these days, but probably not enough to take summers off and go play
for the Philadelphia Wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerney is the fifth first-round choice to sign an NFL contract,
and his deal set in motion a flurry of signings. Atlanta signed
four other draft choices, including tight end Reggie Kelly, the
team's second-rounder.
</P>
<P>
   Both starting defensive ends, Chuck Smith and Lester Archambeau,
are entering the final year of their contracts, and one of them
might not be re-signed. Kerney, though, said he has no plans to
wait until next year to break out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel an urgency to compete this year,'' he said. ``The
players at this level are all bigger, faster and stronger, but I
want to make plays this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The other first-rounders to sign are Cleveland quarterback Tim
Couch, the No. 1 pick, New Orleans running back Ricky Williams, the
No. 5 pick, St. Louis wide receiver Torry Holt, the No. 6 pick, and
Green Bay defensive back Antwan Edwards, the No. 25 pick.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons considered themselves fortunate when Kerney was
still available at the No. 30 spot in the April draft.
</P>
<P>
   He blossomed late, and was projected to go as high as the No. 20
spot after a senior season in which he had 14 sacks and 21 tackles
for a loss.
</P>
<P>
   All scouting reports on Kerney speak of his ``big motor,'' good
quickness and above-average football intelligence. He has worked at
both end spots in passing camp but generally has been projected to
back up Smith at right end.

 &HT;    Signs of the cross
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ They sing the praises of the Lord in
sublime silence.
</P>
<P>
   Their hands become a symphony of movement, making a glad but
silent shout to the Lord.
</P>
<P>
   This congregation sings hymns in sign language at the First
Baptist Deaf Church. They meet in a small, windowless chapel in a
building on the campus of the First Baptist Church in West Palm
Beach, which sponsors them.
</P>
<P>
   But their obvious joy only partly masks the multiple
difficulties of living in a hearing world.
</P>
<P>
   A deaf man watches the song leader sign words. He mimics the
movements as his hearing wife listens to music piped over the sound
system.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who is both deaf and blind gently places her hand on the
moving hand of a deaf friend signing the song. That way, Eleanor
Clay can feel the joy and the promise she can neither hear nor see.
</P>
<P>
   The church _ the only known deaf church in South Florida _ is
all the family she knows.
</P>
<P>
   The 50 members of this little community care for each other
under the watchful eyes of their deaf pastor, the Rev. Jeff
Jackson, 31, the only full-time deaf Baptist minister in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen God's hand leading us to do this,'' said the Rev.
Keith Thomas, senior pastor of First Baptist Church. ``Pastor
Jackson is an extraordinary leader in this ministry. He's
passionate about what God has called him to do in the deaf
community. He is a relentless servant.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson understands, as hearing clergy might not, the silent,
trying world of the deaf.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of forever communicating in the shorthand of sign
language, trying to embrace, silently, a world filled with sound
can be exhausting. Most deaf people have limited, if any, speech
ability. Frustration is a constant companion.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a deaf couple will go to a restaurant without
reservations and not get a table. They drive across town to visit
friends and, upon arrival, are told the time is not convenient. The
obvious solution is impossible for them. They cannot call ahead,
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls trying to order a meal at a McDonald's restaurant
using his hands to communicate. The startled server gave him a
Braille menu.
</P>
<P>
   The variety of relationships in the deaf world tend to
complicate things further. Hearing and deaf partners fall in love
and marry. Deaf children are born to hearing parents, hearing
children to deaf parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be patient,'' Jackson said through an interpreter.
``I try to show the right attitude. I try to do it by example.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people in both the deaf and hearing worlds are unaware that
Sunday is the first day of Deaf/Blind Awareness Week observed
annually in honor of Helen Keller's birthday on June 27.
</P>
<P>
   The Deaf Service Center, a nonprofit United Way agency in West
Palm Beach, does serve the deaf and hearing impaired.
</P>
<P>
   The center offers classes, support and access to the growing
telecommunications technology designed for the deaf.
</P>
<P>
   A few Christian and Jewish congregations interpret hearing
services with sign language. Some have modest programs to engage
and support the deaf.
</P>
<P>
   But few faith communities have tackled the complex problems of
working with a people who cannot easily communicate with the
majority population.
</P>
<P>
   Language preserves and promotes so much of what it means to be
human that the deaf, with a unique language, easily become a unique
and isolated community.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a culture, a people group, unto themselves. They are
not just deaf,'' said Caroline Partin, Jackson's secretary and an
interpreter at the church. ``The biggest problem is getting the
church to recognize the needs of the deaf community.''
</P>
<P>
   Partin, 40, is an example of the complexity of the deaf world.
She is a hearing child of deaf parents and grandparents. She has a
hearing brother, but her cousins were deaf. She grew up in West
Palm Beach, married a deaf man and has four hearing children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're buried,'' Partin said of hearing youngsters in deaf
families. ``We isolate ourselves. We don't want to be associated
with the deaf community. I want to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   She is trying to do that at First Baptist where there are 18
hearing children of deaf parents. They moved easily between the
hearing and the deaf church, she said. Two deaf children are part
of the church's hearing preschool, which meets twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   The church has interpreted services for the deaf for many years
but realized that ministry was inadequate. First Baptist hired
Jackson two years ago to develop a full-service deaf church.
</P>
<P>
   Partin is Jackson's colleague and interpreter for worship, at
hospitals, in homes, meetings, at weddings, funerals and baptisms.
</P>
<P>
   The church sponsors a deaf basketball team for young men in
their 20s. The men have a 13-1 record playing in a hearing league
at Palm Beach Atlantic College in West Palm Beach. Jackson is the
playing coach.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 deaf supporters showed up for a game Tuesday to
cheer _ with their hands. The team won.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the pastor who makes the difference among the deaf.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson coaches sports, teaches the Bible and supports his
silent flock.
</P>
<P>
   He moves easily among his people at worship, offering a pastoral
prayer in American Sign Language, signing Scripture and preaching
sermons with his hands. Partin interprets in English.
</P>
<P>
   Relaxed, enjoying himself and clearly comfortable with both the
word of God and God's deaf people, Jackson's silent signing of the
sermon speaks volumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A deaf pastor is much better than a hearing minister,'' said
Alcides Monroig, 30, through an interpreter. Monroig is a deaf
member from West Palm Beach married to Laura, a hearing woman.
``Hearing pastors talk too fast. Deaf pastors share by
interacting.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was born in Gainesville, deaf but not Baptist. He grew
up attending the Church of God of Anderson, Ind., and the
Presbyterian church. He read lips to get along, not knowing sign
language.
</P>
<P>
   He attended a school for the deaf in St. Louis and went to
Bakersfield College in California. He learned sign language there
and began to attend the Deaf Fellowship Chapel at the First
Southern Baptist Church in Bakersfield, where there was a deaf
pastor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understood the Word of God for the first time because of
sign language,'' he said. ``I gave my life to Christ in 1989.''
</P>
<P>
   The next year, he joined a group of deaf Christians riding
bicycles from California to South Carolina. They stopped at
churches along the way to offer the gospel according to the deaf.
He was ordained at the Bakersfield chapel in 1995 and served there
until he came to West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   He and Partin work together in parallel and vastly different
cultures, trying to enable each to understand and embrace the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Partin, speaking and signing at the same time, explains their
passion:
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in what I do. I want to be a bridge _ connecting two
worlds.

 &HT;    X Games getting extreme exposure
 &HT;    By Israel Gutierrez
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The face in the advertisement may not be
the most recognizable, but it does make a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen-year-old Tara Hamilton is famous enough to be
photographed in her wet suit wearing a pair of Oakley sunglasses.
However, what better displays her popularity is the man in the
Oakley ad a couple of feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the Sunglass Huts in all the malls, there's a big
picture of me and one of Mark McGwire,'' Hamilton said. ``So that's
pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, a Lantana native, is an X Gamer. More specifically,
she is a wakeboarder.
</P>
<P>
   The X Games, an annual Olympic-style event for extreme sports,
began its fifth run Friday, and continues through July 3 in San
Francisco. And as evidenced by Hamilton's sunglasses ad sitting
side-by-side with baseball's home-run king, the event has helped
carry extreme sports away from the highly select scene and almost
into the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 version features a nearly $1 million purse and more
than 400 athletes, many of whom will be covered head-to-toe with
sponsor logos. The U.S. Postal Service even is launching a series
of extreme sports stamps in conjunction with the start of the
games.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Stiepock, director of marketing and communications for the
X Games, was around in 1994 when the idea of an extreme game
Olympics was an attempt to find programming for the new ESPN2
network. While he was trying to sell the idea to anyone who would
listen, he had no idea 19 million U.S. households, and 180
countries, eventually would be watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started this job, I had to spend 15 minutes on
the phone just describing what the concept might be,'' Stiepock
said. ``The only reason anybody ever took my phone calls was
because it had the four letters E-S-P-N next to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I can't handle all the people calling me.''
</P>
<P>
   Those calls come from athletes trying to enter, fans wanting
information about attending and advertisers looking to get their
products shown during the X Games telecast.
</P>
<P>
   And it's often men ages 12-34, the target audience for the X
Games, on the other end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN knew whom it wanted to reach when Ron Semiao, vice
president of programming at ESPN, conceived the X Games idea. There
was an audience of active young men waiting to be captivated by a
unique sporting event. Within the X Games' five years of existence,
advertisers have learned ESPN was quite precise, and they have done
their own part in boosting the success of extreme sports and the X
Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X Games is age-targeted, so you can't say it's Final Four
or Super Bowl,'' said John Lazarus, head of the buying department
for the Bozell advertising agency in New York. ``But for reaching
young men in sports, it has created its own successful niche.''
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Dew, Taco Bell, Snickers and milk are just a few of
this year's X Games sponsors that plan to profit from that success.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Dew was the first company on the X Games bandwagon in
1994, and has since made extreme sports the main focus of its ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what people are participating in right now or what a lot
of people want to participate in. It's just what they aspire to
do,'' said Jon Harris, a spokesman for Pepsi, which makes Mountain
Dew.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great example of all this is how popular the individual
athletes have gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Hamilton and McGwire side-by-side at sunglass shops, the
X Games increased skateboarder Tony Hawk's prominence enough that
he now sports the white mustache in milk ads. And Rick Thorne,
four-time X Games participant and host of ESPN2's monthly show ``X
2day,'' said he is often recognized by his tattoos alone.
</P>
<P>
   But along with the extreme sports growth the X Games helped
generate has come the possibility of overexposure.
</P>
<P>
   In October, NBC will launch its version of the X Games, called
the Gravity Games, largely to fill the void left when it lost NFL
rights. The Winter X Games also is an annual event for ESPN and
ESPN2. And those networks combine to show hundreds of hours of
extreme sports programs throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   Stiepock said ESPN is confident the extreme sports phenomenon is
not a passing fad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like anything that becomes popular, it's impossible to predict
whether it's going to be around five years from now,'' Stiepock
said. ``ESPN thinks it is, and ESPN is devoted to continuing this.
But at the same time, we have woven into our system things that
allow for change.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the open-ended policies include never guaranteeing a
sport will be part of the games from one year to the next. Downhill
in-line skating is one casualty, replaced this year by Motocross-X,
a motorcycle stunt event.
</P>
<P>
   Other networks, however, are not so quick to join in on the
craze, afraid the audience is being spread too thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only so many 12-34 demographic dollars that can go
around,'' said Vince Wladika, senior vice president of media
relations at Fox. ``You may be better off looking at a different
area, creating your own franchise instead of being the third man
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many extreme games franchises can you have? I guess we're
going to find out with NBC starting theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC has yet to see the down side.
</P>
<P>
   When the network began its Gravity Games project, one sign that
showed extreme sports popularity was still on the rise was how
quickly the ad time sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imitation is the best flattery, and ESPN has like a four-year
head start on the Gravity Games,'' said Lazarus, who bought time
during the Gravity Games for the Marines. ``But the Gravity Games
got sold out pretty quickly because there isn't that much
television that really targets this young teen audience.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, the X Games, which has won five Emmy awards,
is still drawing hundreds of thousands of fans (250,000 attended
the 1998 games in San Diego). Hamilton and her fellow extreme
athletes are still gaining sponsors and raking in prize money. And
attempted rivals to the X Games, like the Gravity Games, signal the
steady growth of extreme sports.
</P>
<P>
   They're not yet popular enough, though, to have their own sports
metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For five years, ESPN has been the guy shooting hoops in his
driveway,'' Stiepock said. ``Now, we're finally going to the park
to get a pick-up game.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Aggressive in-line skating:
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive? Try suicidal. Flying through an obstacle course or a
giant half-pipe on skates just cries ``Hurt me!''
</P>
<P>
   _ Bicycle stunt riding:
</P>
<P>
   Only men compete here, which creates an added hazard _ the
bicycle seat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Freestyle Moto-X (new): Motorcycles: Because regular bikes
just weren't dangerous enough.
</P>
<P>
   _ Skateboarding: For skateboarders who don't have enough scars,
trying tricks on an
</P>
<P>
   obstacle course or half-pipe should leave a mark or two.
</P>
<P>
   _ Skysurfing: Keep a sickness bag handy. Humans with cameras
spinning toward Earth probably won't make athletes ill but may
affect viewers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Snowboarding: It's fake snow, but the athletes must have ice
in their veins when they try to get ``bigger air'' than the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sport climbing: Climbers use ropes and harnesses for the Speed
competition, but the real fun should come during Bouldering. All
restraints are gone and the climbers are free to fall to the mats.
</P>
<P>
   _ Street luge racing:A kid's dream: Sledding down a street with
only bales of hay to
</P>
<P>
   protect you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wakeboarding: Like snowboarding, but here, at least the water
cushions the fall.

IN ANDERSEN'S `CENTURY' NOVEL, SEATTLE IS U.S. CAPITAL BUT THERE
ARE DIGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BILL VIRGIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He nailed us.
</P>
<P>
   Professional satirist Kurt Andersen came to town to chronicle,
in novel form, Seattle and its fellow outposts on the raw frontier
of the new techno-economy as the 21st century dawns.
</P>
<P>
   And he did his job exceptionally well.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's problem is that it's not nearly raw enough. One
Microsoft Way: is that not the address of a cult? Notwithstanding
the soccer field and arcade games, the lack of suits and ties and
regular hours, a 1950s corporate DNA showed itself in these boys'
blood strongly and immediately. ... It's the same with their
immense bland houses in Hunts Point and Clyde Hill, and the
Microsoft flag flying next to the Stars and Stripes, and the lame
little fake waterfall trickling through the Red West campus _
billionaires spending, not to transcend suburban backyard-patio
boyhoods, but to reproduce them. It's not your father's Oldsmobile,
but it sure is an Oldsmobile.
</P>
<P>
   That is a passage from Andersen's first novel, ``Turn of the
Century,'' and there's plenty more where that came from. But if
that seems disrespectful of our wonderful city by the Sound,
consider that in this novel-length snapshot of American business
and culture of the near-future (the year 2000), Seattle has been
elevated to the status of capital of the United States, on a par,
and in uneasy if necessary coexistence with, New York and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Necessary, because each supplies something _ publicity,
technology, money _ the others need. Uneasy, because:
</P>
<P>
   The New York (and L.A.) contempt for Seattle (and for Silicon
Valley) can't be argued away. In the last few years it has
diminished some, and changed in texture _ from dismissive and
stupid, to alarmed and baffled, to supercilious and slightly less
baffled. Her husband and her friends regard residents of Seattle
(and Milpitas and Sunnyvale and all the rest) the way Americans
think of Canadians _ they seem like us, and their lives look clean
and civil, but ... who wants to hang out with earnest grad students
full-time.
</P>
<P>
   What's fascinating about this construction is what city is not
included in this geometric construction _ the nation's nominal
capital, Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't accidental, Andersen said in an interview in Seattle
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington (D.C.) was very pointedly left off this geometry of
power and influence for a reason, because I think it's not very
important,'' he said. The Washington, D.C., of his youth, as the
center of debates over the Vietnam War and civil rights, did
matter. Not so with the marriage of money and technology that is
transforming commerce and society today. ``Right now Washington is
important only to itself and viewers of MSNBC.''
</P>
<P>
   That raises the question of whether Seattle (as a shorthand for
the Puget Sound to Bay area digitocracy) is merely the city of the
moment, the way the oil-crisis-enriched cities of Dallas and
Houston were in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Andersen believes. Not that anything is permanent about
the technology business, but Seattle does seem to be ``at the
center of something more important, transformational. ... This
triangle, with the asterisk of depression or wars, will remain the
linchpin of this society.''
</P>
<P>
   So Seattle becomes one of the three principal settings of ``Turn
of the Century,'' and the convergence of capital, entertainment and
software becomes the theme. But why did Andersen, co-founder of Spy
magazine and more recently an essayist for The New Yorker, tackle a
novel rather than an essay or a non-fiction book?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a chance to have more resonance and global
impact by weaving (those themes) in a story than a one-off essay in
The New Yorker,'' he said. ``Some of the excitement _ and terror _
really isn't transmittable in an essay.''
</P>
<P>
   Going the fiction route had its challenges at first _ ``like
being on a different planet with different laws of physics,''
Andersen said. But it also gave him the freedom to set the novel in
the near future and to play with reality. Among the things to look
forward to next year: We'll be watching cable networks like ``The
Chopper Channel'' (nothing but shots of chases, disasters and other
events from the air) or, in a masterpiece of brand extension across
media channels, ``South Park'' as an ice skating show.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been some confusion among readers, `Is that real or
did you make that up?' That pleases me,'' Andersen said. ``Some
friends have said, `Why waste those ideas on a novel? Sell them to
(cable TV industry giant) John Malone.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn of the Century'' extends that sort of ``it ought to be
real, even if it isn't'' take on the very early 21st century to
Seattle. One character visits a Pioneer Square software company
whose employees wear identification badges with high-tech readouts
that display not their identification numbers but the number of
shares and options they hold.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen has some local connections _ his grandfather David
Swarr and father Robert Andersen both served on the board of
Washington Natural Gas. The utility, now part of Puget Sound
Energy, has a Renton facility named for Swarr.
</P>
<P>
   But as an outsider (raised in Omaha, living in New York), his
reading of Seattle is all the more pointed because he skipped the
tired rain-and-coffee jokes about the town.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are some too-delicious-to-resist hits, like
restaurants as pretentious as they are trendy. (In the novel, an
obsequious waiter recites the evening's specials including
``ragouts of free-range north Oregon weasel''.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some obvious jokes, but I tried to get at what I
thought was some of its quirkiness,'' Andersen said.
</P>
<P>
   There was one other advantage to mining a relatively untapped
lode of material like Seattle. ``People in L.A. have heard
everything there is to say about L.A. that is satirical.''

JUSTICE DEPT. REVISES ITS POSITION ON BANK MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- With barely 72 hours left until the bidding closes for
branches that New England's top two banks must sell to meet
antitrust concerns about their merger, the US Department of Justice
told Fleet Financial Group Inc. Friday it would not insist all the
assets be sold to a single buyer.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which supersedes a policy letter that the Washington
agency sent to Fleet last week but later rescinded, appeared to
formally signal a change in position by the agency, one of several
federal and local entities that must approve Fleet's proposed
merger with BankBoston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In a one-page document addressed to a senior Fleet lawyer in New
York and copied to Massachusetts Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly,
the agency wrote that its letter was designed to ``clarify'' that
the Justice Department was ``not imposing any requirements on who
may bid for any or all of the assets being auctioned by Fleet.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, whose office plays a role in reviewing the merger, has
said in the past that competition can be best preserved by a large
bank acquiring most of the assets.
</P>
<P>
   The three-paragraph letter said that Justice needed ``to ensure
that the disposition of assets addresses our substantive antitrust
concerns relating to middle market lending that you are well aware
of from our discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That being said, however, we are not insisting that all assets
be acquired by a single buyer so long as there is a buyer in the
mix that will preserve competitive conditions in middle market
lending.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleet and BankBoston are combining into the nation's eighth
largest bank, with $160 billion in assets after divestiture. As
part of their merger, they are selling more than 290 branches with
$12.5 billion in deposits and $2.2 billion in loans across three
New England states. The two banks are selling the assets because
their combination, which has attracted considerable scrutiny from
regulators concerned about maintaining competition in business
lending, will leave the region with no similar-sized competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding for the assets, which constitute the largest divestiture
in US banking history, is set to close Monday afternoon. The
process has attracted a storm of controversy over whether or how
small community banks, which want to buy some of the assets, should
be allowed to participate in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, community activists, and banking sources expressed
conflicting views on the meaning and import of Justice's new
letter, which came from the agency's antitrust division and was
signed by deputy assistant attorney general Donna E. Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Barney Frank of Newton, the leading Democrat
on the House Banking Committee and a vocal proponent of a role for
local community banks in the bidding process, said Friday that the
letter reflected a ``reversal of position'' on the part of Justice
after fierce lobbying by himself and his Democratic colleague,
Representative J. Joseph Moakley of South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Frank said the agency had sent a letter to Fleet earlier this
month stating that the assets should go to a single large bank from
outside the region. The letter, he said, reflected Justice's
thinking that New England does not have banks large enough to
compete with Fleet-BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, Justice suspended, then withdrew, the
letter, Frank said, adding that the retraction came after he and
Moakley met with a senior Justice antitrust official, Joel Klein,
to lobby for a role for community banks.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice spokeswoman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said Friday's letter did not change Justice's
original intent _ to create competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to interpret exactly what this (second letter)
means,'' Reilly said. ``People can read whatever they want into
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank said Justice was prepared to favor a sale in which
community banks acquire around 10 percent of the assets on sale,
but Friday's letter made no mention of that element, saying only
that ``we understand that the process (sale) will be conducted in a
way that enables anyone to express in interest in any of the
assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleet and BankBoston have always said that bidding is open to
any bank. Industry sources said Fleet executives were reportedly
confused by the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet spokesman James Mahoney declined to comment, saying only,
``We have sent bid packages to a wide range of banks, from
community banks to large banks, and are awaiting the bids.''

THRASHERS, AND NHL, SEEM COOL TO OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Atlanta Thrashers, who chose their first roster in
the expansion draft Friday, are the junior partners in the 28-team
National Hockey League, at least until Columbus and Minnesota join
next summer. But the Thrashers' corporate backing and executive
lineup suggest that this fledgling franchise could already be an
influential player in hockey's boardrooms, perhaps on major issues
like Olympic participation in 2002 in the Winter Games at Salt Lake
City.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers' president is Dr. Harvey Schiller, who is also the
president of Turner Sports, as in Ted Turner, as in ``a Time Warner
company.'' Before joining Turner, Schiller served as executive
director/secretary-general of the U.S. Olympic Committee. Friday
afternoon in Fleet Center here, after the Thrashers drafted players
like defensemen Chris Tamer from the Rangers, Kevin Dean from the
Devils and David Harlock from the Islanders, Schiller expressed
mixed feelings about NHL Olympic participation after its mixed
experience in 1998 in Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was as enthusiastic about NHL Olympic
participation as some are, Schiller answered, ``Probably not.''
And, although he continues to work toward Olympic participation,
commissioner Gary Bettman seemed to put it in a new perspective
Friday when he said, ``For us, the all-star game is more important
than the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to elaborate, Schiller said, ``My feelings may be
different than many other people's,'' and that the NHL is different
from the National Basketball Association, whose players dominate
primarily the U.S. Olympic team, because ``hockey has become an
international sport in this country.'' This complicates matters
when the athletes are repackaged as an Olympic product for several
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics are supposed to be a place where athletes perform
at the highest level in a competitive way,'' Schiller said. ``Are
you doing that right now in the NHL and the Stanley Cup? You are
already seeing the mixture of the best players.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiller was asked if he meant to imply that the Olympics are
not as good an idea for the NHL as some people think. ``It might
not be,'' he said. ``In 1992, in Barcelona, the No. 1-selling
licensed article for the NBA was the Dream Team. The question is,
on a business perspective alone, would that be true for the NHL in
2002? We have a lot of discussion ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Network exposure is a major issue. During the Nagano Games, CBS
carried games in the early morning hours. Bettman has tried to
persuade NBC to maximize exposure for Olympic hockey, possibly in
prime time. Bettman said again Friday that the International Ice
Hockey Federation has set a Sept. 15 deadline of this year for the
NHL's decision. ``What we have to assess between now and the 15th
of September,'' Bettman said, ``is whether or not the circumstances
are such that it makes sense to go. If it makes sense, we'll do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bettman refused to be specific when asked about circumstances or
prime-time television, either on NBC or on its cable partners MSNBC
and CNBC. He said, in general, that the league wanted to know
``whether or not the exposure and the conditions under which we
would go warrant stopping the season.'' The break in the season
probably would be 12 days, Bettman said, instead of the 16 in 1998.
He said the NHL would not give up its all-star game, which requires
another break. ``The Olympics would be secondary to our season,''
Bettman said, adding that the all-star game is part of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Lamoriello, president of the Devils, managed the American
hockey team in Nagano and said Friday: ``I don't think we have
enough information now. There have to be some guarantees as far as
times before the NHL can even consider it.''

   Russia moved a step closer toward securing a new $4.5 billion

government revenue and restructure the collapsed banking sector.
Russia has not done everything the IMF has demanded. A new tax on

CLINTON URGES ACTION ON PRESSING DOMESTIC NEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Turning his attention from success in Kosovo to his
stalled agenda at home, President Clinton Friday urged lawmakers
not to ``run out the clock'' before the next election and to work
instead to shore up Social Security, raise the minimum wage, rein
in health insurance companies and help seniors pay for prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The president used a speech to Georgetown University students
and a formal news conference to try to revive his domestic agenda,
warning that the presidential and congressional races for the year
2000 will soon harden political positions and make it difficult for
Congress to pass new laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be plenty of time for politics in the year and a
half ahead,'' he said, ``but this summer must be a season of
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy and wide-ranging news conference, his first since
March, Clinton also said NATO was doing all it could to stop ethnic
Albanians from seeking revenge on Serbs in Kosovo. He suggested
that wealthier Americans might be asked to pay higher Medicare
premiums. He said he misspoke earlier this year when he claimed
that no security breaches occurred at US nuclear labs under his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The president also acknowledged complaints from hospitals and
nursing homes that the government has cut their funding too steeply
in an attempt to shore up the financially shaky Medicare program.
Boston teaching hospitals have been among the loudest protesters.
But Clinton said the cuts helped extend the solvency of Medicare by
15 years, and he did not offer any relief.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to reflect on impeachment and the Monica S. Lewinsky
scandal, the president brushed off suggestions that his personal
behavior would hurt the political fortunes of his wife, who may run
for senator from New York, or of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``All elections are about the future, and all candidates are
judged on their own merits,'' Clinton said. He said Americans gave
him credit for working to be ``the best president I could be'' and
to ``repair my family life.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's policy offensive came only two days after he returned
from a weeklong European trip, where he had celebrated NATO's
victory in Kosovo and talked with NATO and Russian leaders about
how to patrol the peace in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans appeared surprised by Clinton's speedy return to
domestic themes, and they called their own rally on Capitol Hill to
lay out their agenda. Top items include a bigger defense budget, an
effort to strengthen Social Security finances and a cut in income
and other taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will fight for tax relief for working Americans,'' said
House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert. ``I ask the president, please
include tax relief on your agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for passing any major legislation this year are
weak, many analysts say. With only a six-vote margin in the House,
Republican leaders have found it difficult to build a majority for
major programs. In the Senate, GOP leaders have been unable to move
legislation in recent days because Democrats keep trying to tack on
a contentious HMO-regulation measure.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, positions have hardened on some of the major issues.
Both parties, for example, say they want a ``patients bill of
rights'' to force health-maintenance organizations to offer better
insurance coverage. But Republicans are against a Democratic plan
to allow HMO patients to sue their health plans when care is
denied. Most HMO members are barred from suing under existing law.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are expected to push for a broad tax cut package
that would eliminate the so-called marriage penalty, end death
taxes, cut the capital gains tax and possibly have more earnings
taxed at the lowest current level, 15 percent. Clinton has said he
does not oppose tax cuts, but he wants any package to include
breaks to help families cover the costs of child care and long-term
care for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   To put Medicare on a stronger financial footing, Republicans
want to allow seniors to leave the program and enroll instead in
private plans, which would compete for members by offering
attractive benefit packages.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats fear this would draw the healthiest seniors into
private plans, leaving Medicare with the sickest and most expensive
patients. But Democrats are divided over how to improve Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Clinton will propose a new benefit that would help
seniors cover the cost of prescription drugs. To fund the plan,
however, he might propose that wealthier Medicare enrollees pay
higher premiums than low-income seniors _ an idea that is drawing
Democratic opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reischauer, a Brookings Institution scholar who tracks
economic policy, said the Republican and Democratic press events
laid down political markers for some important economic
announcements next week.
</P>
<P>
   The White House budget office on Monday and the Congressional
Budget Office on Thursday are expected to release new estimates of
government spending and revenues. The last estimates predicted a
modest deficit of between $5 billion and $12 billion for next year,
even when the massive Social Security surpluses that fund much of
government are excluded.
</P>
<P>
   But next week, Reischauer said, the new projections are expected
to show that the small deficit will actually be a small surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between a negative and a positive number has
immense psychological importance,'' Reischauer said. ``This is
going to set off a feeding frenzy, where members of Congress are
going to say there's money that can be devoted to tax cuts,
discretionary spending, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to more than 25 questions at the news conference
Friday, Clinton also:
</P>
<P>
   -- Made an emotional appeal for Yugoslav Serbs ``to get out of
denial'' about the violence in Kosovo conducted under President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs are ``going to have to come to grips with what Mr.
Milosevic ordered in Kosovo ... And then, they're going to have to
decide whether they support his leadership or not, whether they
think it's OK that all those tens of thousands of people were
killed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Amended his March 19 statement that ``no one has said
anything to me about any espionage'' by China at US nuclear labs
during his administration.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, news reports revealed that a Los Alamos National
Laboratory scientist downloaded information from classified
computers into his personal computers during Clinton's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I should have said was I did not know of any specific
instance of espionage, because I think that we've been suspicious
all along ... We did not have any specific instance, as we now do,
of the off-loading of the computer,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   --Said he would produce a book on race, building on Clinton's
advisory panel on race.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported this week that the book project had
become mired in disputes among its writers. Several drafts have
been produced, with Harvard law professor Christopher Edley Jr.
serving as the top consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the book was delayed only because his other duties
have distracted him from the project. ``It's got to be first of all
mine,'' he said. ``It's got to reflect what I believe and where I
think we need to go.''

RULINGS A SETBACK FOR PATENT HOLDERS AND STATE WORKERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt., Fla., Me.)   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The closely decided federalism cases at the Supreme
Court this week not only enlivened the debate about the
relationship between Congress and the states but also profoundly
changed the rights of two categories of people: state employees and
holders of patents and copyrights like inventors, authors and
composers.
</P>
<P>
   In three 5-4 rulings, the court said that the ``sovereign
immunity'' of states shielded them from private lawsuits to enforce
federal laws governing the workplace as well as those protecting
patents and trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   One major practical effect of the ruling, many lawyers say, is
that private companies, inventors and scientists who hold patents
have no immediate recourse to obtain damages when they believe
those patents have been violated by state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   While it might surprise many people to learn that states compete
with private interests in such commercial activity, many state
university systems _ arms of the state governments _ are deeply
engaged in research and aggressively seek to accumulate patents to
increase their income.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Wexler, a New York lawyer with the New York Intellectual
Property Law Association, said Friday that, for the moment, ``if
the state is out there infringing your patent,'' you will not be
able to collect lost profits; damages, if the infringement was
willful, or attorneys' fees.
</P>
<P>
   A friend-of-the-court brief filed by Wexler's group noted that
the University of Florida system, for example, holds more than 200
patents, a fact mentioned prominently by Justice John Paul Stevens
in his dissent from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler said the Florida university patents included items or
processes as varied as an insect repellent, a way to enhance the
images on projection screens, a method of reinforcing supports used
in construction made of plastic and concrete and a system to
recycle atmosphere in closed spaces.
</P>
<P>
   A patent may be obtained by anyone for a process as well as a
product. One of the Supreme Court cases was about a complaint from
a bank that it had patented a college tuition savings plan that was
unfairly copied by a Florida state agency. The ruling means the
bank may no longer sue the state for damages in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a lawsuit brought by Genentech, a California
biotechnology company, charging that the University of California
improperly appropriated patented research involving human hormones
is now almost certain to be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Shannen W. Coffin, a Washington lawyer and authority on the
issue, said that the courts' rulings had effectively taken away the
strongest incentive for a potential plaintiff to challenge state
patent infringements, as well that of public employees to complain
that states are not complying with federal employment laws.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rulings, Coffin said, it may still be possible for
patent-holders or aggrieved employees to sue to prevent the state
from continuing to violate federal employment laws or patent
infringement. But such lawsuits, under a specific 19th-century
precedent, could deal only with future violations and could not
seek to recover damages like back pay or lost profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often it's not worth a party's time to sue to stop a future
violation,'' he said. ``The incentive has been greatly changed.''
</P>
<P>
   An alternative is for the federal government to take legal
action against the state. The Justice Department or the Labor
Department may sue a state, but the patent and fair labor laws were
based on the notion they would be enforced by private lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Robert T. Scully, the executive director of the National
Association of Police Organizations, said that the rulings meant
that law-enforcement officers might no longer sue to force states
to comply with federal laws on issues like overtime. Scully's group
had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in one of the cases, in which
parole officers in Maine tried to sue the state for overtime
guaranteed by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court said that the federal government itself, maybe the
Labor Department, could bring suit,'' Scully said. ``But that's not
going to happen. To do that, they would have to hire hundreds of
more lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's re-alignment of the relationship between the states
and the federal government is likely to continue. The court
expanded its review of state immunity by accepting a new case, for
argument in the fall, on the question of whether whistle-blowers
can sue states under the federal False Claims Act.
</P>
<P>
   That law enables people to bring lawsuits, in the name of the
United States, for fraud against the government. If a suit is
successful, the private plaintiff receives part of the penalty as a
bounty.
</P>
<P>
   The lower federal courts have disagreed over whether states can
be named in such suits. The Justices on Thursday accepted an appeal
by Vermont, which was charged by one of its employees under the
False Claims Act with filing false claims in connection with a
federal grant from the Environmental Protection Agency. The 1st
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Boston, rejected the state's
claim of immunity under the 11th Amendment and ruled last year that
the lawsuit could proceed. The case is Vermont vs. U.S., No.
98-1828.

FBI PROPOSES A SEPARATE DIVISION TO COMBAT ESPIONAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI is proposing to create a new division
devoted solely to rooting out spies, part of a government-wide
overhaul of counterintelligence underway as a result of failures to
address suspicions that China tried for two decades to steal
nuclear secrets, government officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union, American
intelligence agencies increasingly focused on fighting terrorism,
believing that espionage would become less of a threat. As a
result, counterintelligence efforts dwindled, according to experts
inside and outside the government.
</P>
<P>
   At the FBI, for example, the national security division added
counterterrorism activities to its traditional emphasis on fighting
espionage. Officials said that there was a growing sense that as
the battle against terrorism assumed more importance, counter
espionage operations were given short shrift.
</P>
<P>
   Now officials are proposing new ways for the government to
organize to emphasize both threats, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI director, Louis J. Freeh, has proposed splitting the
national security division into two divisions, one to fight
terrorism and the other to root out spies, which would be led by
assistant directors, the officials said. Attorney General Janet
Reno has approved the request and forwarded it to the White House,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   The government-wide overhaul also includes reviews by the
Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency, which officials
expect will also lead to some organizational changes. The overhaul
is a tacit acknowledgment that the government has failed to keep
pace with new forms of espionage. The United States not only faces
efforts to steal military secrets, but also economic espionage
aimed at stealing technology or getting information that would help
one country's goods compete against another's. The espionage is not
only conducted by foreign governments and military intelligence
services, but also corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The overhaul represents the first time the three agencies have
systematically attempted to jointly assess espionage threats. The
FBI and other agencies separately conducted counterespionage
programs during the Cold War, but those operations have dwindled
since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   A new division of the FBI devoted solely to counterintelligence
would add agents and analysts to the efforts against foreign
espionage, reflecting the rapidly changing climate of global
threats against American interests.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the broader review, the FBI is likely to change its
traditional system of assessing threats and allocating budgets on a
country-by-country basis, officials said. That system, known at the
National Security Threat List, is likely to be scrapped, the
officials said. Instead, it would probably be replaced by a more
sophisticated system that would take also assess threats from
corporations and even international criminal organizations.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, the review will focus on threats to the
military and to the thousands of contractors, academics and
research laboratories that work with the agency, said Kenneth
Bacon, the Defense Department spokesman. ``The review will analyze
the threat and determine whether our response is adequate,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the CIA, officials said that only preliminary discussions
have been held to review counterintelligence operations. George J.
Tenet, the director of central intelligence, and Freeh testified on
Wednesday to the Senate Intelligence Committee about the
reorganization review.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate review, the government is also changing procedures
at the country's nuclear weapons laboratories. Those changes,
including special squads of agents at the nuclear labs, were first
reported in The Los Angeles Times and are being handled by
officials at the FBI and the Energy Department. The reorganization
plan is a reaction to criticism of the government's handling of
suspected Chinese espionage at the labs. Some lawmakers said the
FBI and the Justice Department failed to aggressively investigate
possible instances of Chinese espionage, including cases like that
of Wen Ho Lee, the nuclear scientist suspected of helping the
Chinese acquire advance thermonuclear technology. Lee has denied
that he ever spied for China. Chinese officials have denied
stealing nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials said that the Lee case shows how hard it is to
fight new espionage techniques, which involve informal contacts
between scientists working in exotic disciplines that are often
hard to ferret out and evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   Some law enforcement officials have said that the increasing
focus on counterterrorism cases, including both domestic and
international investigations, had drawn attention of senior
managers away from ongoing and often unglamorous
counterintelligence work of keeping track of foreign visitors and
Americans traveling abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Reorganizing counterintelligence operations represents the
latest step in the long and often troubled relationship between the
agencies primarily responsible for catching spies, the FBI and the
CIA. Throughout most of the Cold War, the agencies were often at
odds over counterintelligence policy, jealously guarding their
turf.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   FBI agents and CIA officers recruited their own informants and
often refused to share leads and information about potential cases.
At times, the counterspy operations seemed to spin out of control.
James J. Angleton, the counterintelligence chief at the CIA,
conducted zealous hunts for suspected moles at the agency, an
effort that threatened to bring the agency to a standstill and
ruined the careers of loyal agency employees.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts at cooperation in the 1980s culminated with the
successful prosecution of Aldrich H. Ames, the CIA officer who in
1993 pleaded guilty to spying for Moscow after an investigation
concluded that he had turned over to the Russians the identities of
more than a dozen Eastern bloc officials who were spying for the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   After the Ames case, a shattering experience for the CIA, new
rules were adopted to require the agency to report possible
security breaches to the FBI. The two agencies have exchanged
personnel to work on counterintelligence matters and Freeh and
Tenet have sought to forge a better relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Specific events have helped, like the FBI's arrest in 1997 of
Mir Amal Kansi, the gunman arrested in Pakistan, who was returned
to the United States and convicted of killing two people in 1993
outside CIA headquarters.

COREY DILLON'S LIFE NOW REVEALS A SOFTER, MORE GROUNDED SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FEDERAL WAY _ There are baby pictures on the wall, the table and
the big-screen television set. A padded baby carrier sits next to
the leather couch.
</P>
<P>
   This is home for Corey Dillon, one of the most talented, and
perhaps misunderstood, athletes to emerge from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   His name is in the NFL and University of Washington record
books, his jersey in pro football's hall of fame, rewards for
carrying a football like no other.
</P>
<P>
   Yet you should see Dillon, 24, run a juice bottle to 6-month-old
Cameron Antoine-Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday afternoon, the gifted Cincinnati Bengals back will
host the second Corey Dillon Football Camp at Seattle's Garfield
High School, for boys ages 8 to 15. He will hand out T-shirts and
advice. He will serve up lunch and sign autographs. He will pay for
it all himself.
</P>
<P>
   He also will let as many as 200 little Corey Dillons smother him
to death.
</P>
<P>
   And on Sundays and Tuesdays, you can find him at the Faith
Deliverance Assembly church in South Seattle, attending services
and bible study, a member and born-again Christian since Easter
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a whole lot of things needed changing in my life,''
said Dillon, a large gold cross hanging around his neck. ``I feel
extremely better. I can't measure how good I feel from before to
now. It's a great change.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the soft side of Corey Dillon - one often obscured by
the explosive manner in which he plays pro football and by a
simmering temperament that has led to well-publicized brushes with
the law.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't deny the unpleasantness, a wide range of juvenile
missteps and a couple as an adult, most for fighting. But he says
one episode - a conviction as a 15-year-old for selling crack
cocaine to a police officer - was not fully explained and unfairly
tainted him.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday at Garfield, Dillon will lecture to his camp
followers about the evils of drug use. He does not wish to be a
hypocrite. He wants the record set straight.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Dillon was arrested in downtown Seattle with three
other youths after one of his friends was found with drugs. All
were charged with intent to sell. Prosecution was tough whenever
police sweeps netted street drugs, geared to wipe out gangs, which
were widespread across the city back then.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon was told by a public defender to plead guilty for lesser
punishment or face the possibility of one year of incarceration if
he didn't and lost. He was told the record would be sealed when he
turned 18. He took the easy way out legally. He suffered for it
more than he could have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Instant football fame at Washington led to a presidential-like
scouring of his past, and the drug conviction turned up. People
looked at Dillon in a different light. He gave up trying to defend
himself. No more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I invite anybody to do this: open the file and I want them to
show me where it says I sold drugs to a police officer; I'll give
them a million bucks if they can,'' he said. ``I took the rap for
someone else. I come from a decent family. I know better. I never
sold drugs. I never will. I don't use drugs. They stop you from
performing. Everything I've got, God gave it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his camp-goers, Dillon wants one other person to have
the full story behind his teenaged drug bust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got my own family and whatever comes out on this reflects
on them,'' he said with a piercing stare. ``I don't want my
daughter reading how her father went into drugs or was selling
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, Cameron Antoine-Dillon might have difficulty weaving
her way through all the tales of her father's extraordinary
football feats to find any dirt. In three short seasons, Dillon has
been nothing short of spectacular, if not mystical. The
possibilities for the rugged back are endless.
</P>
<P>
   In his three-month stay at Washington, he rushed for 222 yards
in a quarter against San Jose State, 259 yards against Oregon and
five touchdowns against UCLA. In just eight games, he ran for a
school-record 1,555 yards and scored 23 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Two seasons with the Bengals have netted him a pair of
1,000-yard seasons and a record-breaking 246 yards in a game
against the Oilers, eclipsing Jim Brown's rookie rushing mark.
</P>
<P>
   Football immortality would be fine by Dillon, who carries a
sculpted 6-foot-2, 220-pound frame honed by disciplined offseason
workouts at Bally's in Federal Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's everybody's dream when they leave the game, if not be
the best, to be one of the best,'' he said. ``I'd be lying if I
didn't say it was a goal of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   His first contract made him a millionaire; his second, after
this season, should triple or quadruple his earnings. Yet he has
been somewhat restrained in his spending habits. He bought his
mother another Rainier Valley house. He lives in a modest
condominium in south King County with his fiancee, Desiree Antoine,
and their young child.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon's only vice has been cars. He has five of them: a
Mercedes Benz, BMW, Range Rover, Cadillac and, his personal
favorite, a 1968 Mustang. His fiancee drives one; his best friend,
Wayne McDade, drives another at Dillon's insistence. The fleet
serves as a measuring stick for Dillon's life struggles and
successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My toys are my cars; that's all I ever wanted,'' Dillon said.
``I basically came from nothing. I cherish everything I have. I
know how it's like not having something to eat or begging for
rides, riding the bus or riding a bike. When I'm alone in my car, I
praise the Lord for everything I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Said McDade, a social worker: ``He's still just Corey to me. No
matter how much money he has. Other friends want to hang around him
for status. We just sit around and talk. It's hard for me to
separate Corey and the professional football player. He's the same
old funny Corey. He's the same friend I knew in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Dillon attended Franklin, but his football beginnings came on
Central Area Youth Association teams that played at Garfield, hence
the camp site. He has seen positive change in the neighborhood and
wants to be part of it.
</P>
<P>
   McDade and he came up with the idea to hold the camp. It will be
a permanent fixture.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making strides, making it better,'' Dillon said of the
Central Area, a rugged, intercity neighborhood in Seattle. ``From
what I can see, it looks real good. They're building Garfield up
real nice. Those were things I was wishing for.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no Corey Dillons when he was growing up, no local pro
athletes returning home to encourage the next generation to dream
big. He wanted one. He might have avoided some of his youthful
scrapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll send a message to them: There's going to be a lot of hard
times in life, but if you'll work hard, you'll achieve your
goals,'' Dillon said of the camp youngsters. ``Basically what it
takes is someone to tell them they can be what they want to be. I
didn't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, there are diapers to change, bottles to prepare, the
future to consider. He's a father now. There won't be any more
Dillons running around wild. Not his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I'm going to be one of those guys waiting in the
(window) blinds, waiting for her to come home,'' he said.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the closing days of World War II in 1945, U.S.
troops of the 90th Infantry Division entered Eichstaett, a German
town. Tossing grenades as they moved down a building stairway, the
soldiers found a vault containing a package marked with the wax
seals of the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Inside were four sheets of typewritten paper dated Sept. 15,
1935. The papers _ the original text of the Nuremberg Laws, which
legally excluded Jews from German life and were a critical step in
initiating the Holocaust _ were signed by Hitler and other German
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of their discovery the papers were given to George
Patton Jr., commanding general of the 3rd Army. ``They have given
me a lot of other things, but this is the one important one,''
Patton said in presenting the papers _ as well as a limited and
unexpurgated text of Hitler's ``Mein Kampf'' found by U.S. soldiers
in Weimar _ to the Huntington Library in Pasadena, Calif., on June
11, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The Huntington has rare books, an art gallery and, most
important, an extensive library focusing on British and American
history and art.
</P>
<P>
   Since Patton's presentation, the documents have been kept locked
at the library. But on Monday the Huntington is to announce that
the text will be lent for an indefinite time to the Skirball
Cultural Center in Los Angeles. The Skirball, not far from the
Getty Museum, off the San Diego Freeway, is a three-year-old museum
dealing with the Jewish experience in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I visited the Skirball and came to the Nazi persecution
of Jews, I realized they ought to have these documents,'' said
Robert Skotheim, president of the Huntington. ``We're primarily an
Anglo-American research center. Here was material that was really
outside our research scope and outside the expertise of our
curators.'' He said the museum had not given any thought in recent
years to displaying the documents until his visit to the Skirball
in the summer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Although the documents do not reveal any new historical
knowledge, he said, the papers have considerable emotional
resonance. ``When one looks at the actual papers that Adolf Hitler
held in his hands and signed, it causes not merely an intellectual
reaction but a visceral one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Skirball's president Uri Herscher, whose parents fled Germany in
1935 for Palestine, said that some board members who serve jointly
at both museums had told him about the materials. Herscher, who is
also a rabbi, said that when he saw the documents, ``I felt like I
was holding evil in my hands.'' It is rare, he said, for the public
to see an original document with Hitler's signature.
</P>
<P>
   The documents will be on display at the Skirball from Tuesday
until Sept. 5. They are to go on permanent display in December
after museum renovations.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of the Huntington was a personal decision by
Patton. He had grown up in Pasadena, and his family had been
friends with Henry Edwards Huntington, the real estate and railroad
magnate who founded the library and art center in 1919.
</P>
<P>
   The three Nuremberg Laws were drafted at a hastily assembled
meeting of German leaders at a police station on Sept. 14, 1935,
and became law the next day. The laws prohibited marriage,
cohabitation and relations between ``Aryans'' and Jews, and defined
a citizen of the German Reich as being of ``German blood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a theoretical document,'' Herscher said. ``It's a
blueprint for what became the death camps.'' The next big step, he
said, was Kristallnacht in 1938, then the wearing of yellow stars,
followed by deportations and finally the camps.

CALICHMAN ANCHORS REVOLUTION DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ A year ago, Dan Calichman would have had difficulty
imagining that he would be the most dependable and durable field
player on the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But Calichman's life changed dramatically after his fibula and
tibia were broken in the eighth game of the 1998 season. He had
been captain of the Los Angeles Galaxy, which was favored to
challenge for the MLS Cup title. But the Galaxy was eliminated in
the playoff semifinals and Calichman was considered expendable by
former coach Octavio Zambrano.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution acquired Calichman in January, and he has
anchored the defense, playing every minute of the first 14 games of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing what I get paid to do,'' Calichman said while
preparing for Saturday night's game against the Dallas Burn. ``But
I still don't think I'm playing up to the way I was playing before
the injury. It will be another month and a half or two months
before that happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm content with the way the team is playing now, and you can
see we're making progress. It's obvious we are getting to be a
closer-knit group on the field, and we're getting results because
of that. But if you look at our starting lineup, we haven't had the
same 11 out there for two games in a row yet. All year, we've been
fighting injuries. Once we get a healthy team on the field,
consistently, we'll be a lot stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution will be missing Richard Goulooze (Achilles
strain), John Harkes (left hamstring pull) and Ivan McKinley and
Carlos Parra (suspensions) against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   That should open the way for Argentinian defender Mario Gori,
acquired from Miami in exchange for Edwin Gorter this week. Gori
could move into Ted Chronopoulos' left back position, with
Chronopoulos moving to midfield.
</P>
<P>
   Calichman and goalkeeper-coach Walter Zenga are the only
Revolution players to have started every game this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have four key players out, but when guys are out we just
have to get out and battle,'' Calichman said. ``It's not as pretty
when you do that, but we have to make up for it in effort. When
guys are injured, someone else has to step up, and it gives them a
chance to show what they can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have us winning some games, 4-0 or 5-0. But, if
not, we're having to fight hard to win games and that can build
chemistry and bonding.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Calichman became accustomed to some high-scoring
blowouts while playing for the Galaxy. Most home games were like a
celebration, with the largest crowds in the league and celebrity
players ranging from the actor Andrew Shue to Mexican
goalkeeper/striker Jorge Campos to the US striker Cobi Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Calichman has been greeted by equally receptive crowds in New
England, but the Revolution coaches and players are in a pragmatic
mode, with little concern for aesthetics or extraneous
pyrotechnics. The approach has produced 15 points and a third-place
standing in the Eastern Conference. The team's aim to qualify for
the MLS Cup title game, scheduled Nov. 21 at Foxboro Stadium,
seemed unrealistic a few months ago. Now, two games from the
halfway point in the season, the Revolution have a chance to gain
some credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``You haven't seen the best of New England yet,'' Calichman
said. ``It's coming, and the more we train together and keep away
from injury, the better chance we have to keep improving.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NOTES -- The MLS will conduct ceremonies for its 10 millionth
fan at games this weekend and July 4, when the Revolution plays
host to the MetroStars.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is angered and hurt by Vice
President Gore's conspicuous efforts to distance himself from
Clinton's behavior in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, according to
presidential aides and advisers. They say the vice president's
words have created a friction that never before existed between the
two men.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most tense their relationship has ever been,'' one
close Clinton adviser said this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is very upset,'' this adviser said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``To the people who he is very close to, he
is expressing how hurt he is and his dismay at the vice president.
It is not a passing thing. He is very upset.''
</P>
<P>
   The president considers Gore's repeated condemnations of
Clinton's actions and false statements arising from his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky to be acts of ingratitude bordering
on disloyalty, several of the president's advisers said in
interviews over the past several days.
</P>
<P>
   Gore called the president's behavior ``inexcusable'' three times
in a television interview that aired last week on the day he
announced his campaign for the presidency. He said Clinton had
compromised the dignity of the presidency by his actions and that,
``particularly as a father,'' he felt Clinton's relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky was ``terribly wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gore, using convoluted language whose meaning was eminently
clear, said that Clinton had lied to him.
</P>
<P>
   The interviewer, Diane Sawyer of ABC, prodded Gore with repeated
questions about the president. But Gore never cut her off by saying
he had already answered the questions, a point raised by two
Clinton aides who were critical of the vice president's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the president has said he ``took no offense'' at
Gore's remarks and that he has said far worse things about himself.
</P>
<P>
   But in private, the president was described by aides as
``livid'' and disappointed by the vice president's comments, while
at the same time aware that Gore must deal with questions about the
Lewinsky affair and establish an identity separate from the
president's to run a credible campaign for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly seven years of an extraordinarily warm and close
working relationship with the vice president, Clinton is painfully
coming to grips with the fact that Gore must emerge as his own man.
The president's feelings are compounded by the prospect of his
wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, setting up housekeeping in New York
and running for office in her own right.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Clinton's anger was what aides perceived to be
``gloating'' by members of the Gore team at the success of their
efforts to distance the vice president from the president's
personal misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Gore's people are calling people saying we've got
separation from Clinton,'' a member of the president's inner circle
said. ``And they are sort of bragging about it.''

   ``I know Gore's people are calling people saying we've got
separation from Clinton,'' a member of the president's inner circle
said. ``And they are sort of bragging about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The motives for Clinton's aides and advisers to talk about the
president's feelings toward Gore were not entirely clear. They may
have been trying to help the vice president establish distance from
the president by portraying Clinton as angry. They may have been
trying to demonstrate their closeness to the president. Or they may
simply have been honestly reporting how Clinton and his inner
circle have reacted to Gore's statements.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers acknowledged that the vice president has tried
to put space between him and Clinton on matters of personal
morality, which has become a rhetorical centerpiece of his emerging
campaign. They are happy that the vice president got a prominent
platform for his disavowal of the president's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And, privately, they admit that there is an element of payback
for what they see as the president's meddling and second-guessing
about the progress of Gore's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Clinton told The New York Times that he believed
Gore's campaign was off to a stumbling start and said he had
advised his understudy to loosen up on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   The second-guessing has continued, with the president's aides
questioning Gore's decision to announce a forward-looking campaign
for the presidency on the same day that he gave an interview to Ms.
Sawyer criticizing the president past actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't mind the vice president saying what the president did
was inexcusable,'' said James Carville, a political consultant and
adviser to the president. ``But we're glad the vice president is
starting to talk about the many good things the president did,
rather than the one bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the president's press secretary, said that he and
Clinton had discussed Gore's announcement, a carefully staged event
in the vice president's hometown of Carthage, Tenn., on Wednesday,
June 16. Clinton was in Europe at the time for a meeting of leaders
of the major industrial democracies and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and I had the same take,'' Lockhart said. ``He
was trying to do too much by announcing and trying to separate on
the same day.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that the vice president did a good job in his
announcement speech of defining who he is and why he is qualified
to be president. But his comments in the television interview about
his differences with Clinton gave reporters license to write
Gore-blasts-Clinton stories on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the president and vice president said that the two men
had spoken several times since Gore's announcement and interview,
but refused to characterize the tone of the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential confidant said of Clinton, ``I don't think anyone
feels worse about what happened than him. He lives with it every
day; he lives with those consequences. But he'd rather not have to
be reminded of them by his vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   One adviser to the vice president said that he was not aware of
any friction between Gore and Clinton, but said that it is natural
that their relationship would change because of the changed
circumstances.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the past seven years, Gore has been the president's loyal
deputy, entrusted with an unusual amount of authority and
visibility. Now, as he seeks to forge his own identity and make a
case for elevation to the highest office, he must define the ways
he is different from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   That is bound to lead to conflicts, this Gore adviser said, and
perhaps suspicions of disloyalty on the president's part.
</P>
<P>
   ``His job as vice president has been to do everything he
possibly can to make Clinton the best president he can,'' the
adviser said. ``That yields one kind of relationship. Now Gore is
doing something else too. It's not necessarily about tension in the
relationship. It's just a very different relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The president is pretty sophisticated and
understands that.''

PRESBYTERIANS AGAIN SAY NO TO GAY MINISTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An effort to repeal a law that effectively bars ordination of
gay men and lesbians in the Presbyterian Church (USA) was defeated
by a 3-to-2 ratio Friday by the church's General Assembly, the top
policy-making body.
</P>
<P>
   The 319-198 vote by commissioners, as the assembly's delegates
are called, came after a committee had recommended deleting an
amendment to the denomination's constitution, the Book of Order.
The assembly has been holding its annual meeting this week in Fort
Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, approved by the assembly in 1996 and adopted
through a vote of the presbyteries, or regional jurisdictions,
requires ministers, elders and deacons to live in ``fidelity within
the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman, or chastity in
singleness.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the amendment applies to everyone ordained, it has been
regarded as primarily a bar to the ordination of noncelibate
homosexuals. The question of whether the church should allow gay
men and lesbians to be ordained has roiled the 3.6 million-member
denomination for years.
</P>
<P>
   An effort two years ago by the amendment's opponents to soften
its language passed in the assembly but failed when a majority of
presbyteries voted against that change.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's vote, following an hour's discussion, came after a
majority of the assembly's Committee on Church Orders and Ministry,
in a surprise move on Tuesday night, had recommended deleting the
amendment. A repeal would have been a two-part process, requiring
the assembly's approval and then ratification by a majority of
presbyteries.
</P>
<P>
   Had the process succeeded, supporters of gay ordination would
still have had to overturn a 1978 assembly policy that
``self-affirming, practicing homosexual persons'' could not be
ordained within the denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Friday the assembly adopted another recommendation, put forward
by a minority on the Church Orders committee, which called for
retaining the amendment and imposing what amounts to a two-year
moratorium on further discussion in the assembly. The minority's
report also called for discussions on church unity within the
presbyteries.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, the Covenant Network of Presbyterians, an
organization that opposes the amendment, said that it would
continue to work for its removal but that it wanted to do so
``without tearing apart the church we love and serve.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jack Haberer, the former moderator of the Presbyterian
Coalition, which supports the amendment, said in a telephone
interview that he was pleased by the assembly's vote but concerned
that a struggle could resume when the moratorium was over.
</P>
<P>
   Haberer also said he welcomed the discussions on church unity,
saying Presbyterians needed to talk about many issues, like
addressing differences in worship styles.

NORTH KOREA RELEASES DETAINED TOURIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ North Korea Friday released a South Korean tourist
detained earlier this week on charges of trying to lure North
Koreans to defect. The move is expected to ease Korean tensions,
which have been rising since a clash of warships in the Yellow Sea
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The tourist, a 35-year-old woman who was taken into custody on
Sunday during a tour of the Mount Kumgang resort in North Korea,
was handed over to officials of the Hyundai Group, the South Korean
conglomerate that operates the tour, South Korean officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She appears to be in good health,'' a Hyundai spokesman, Lee
Young- kyu, said. ``Our doctors in the North will give her a brief
medical checkup, and then she will leave for the South on a Hyundai
tugboat.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korean security authorities said the woman, Min Young-mi,
had tried to persuade a North Korean tour guide to defect to the
South. The North's official Korean Central News Agency said the
government had decided to release her because she admitted that she
had ``preached defection'' to the guide. The news agency said that
the woman ``begged for lenient forgiveness for her criminal act.''
It was impossible to verify the account.
</P>
<P>
   The detention once again raised tensions between the Koreas,
which have never signed a peace treaty formally ending the 1950-53
Korean War. Last week, the two countries' skirmish in the Yellow
Sea resulted in the sinking of a North Korean boat and the deaths
of 20 North Korean sailors.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of North and South Korea held long-awaited talks in
Beijing on Tuesday to discuss reuniting families divided by the
war, but those discussions ended with both sides trading
accusations over which was responsible for the marine conflict. The
talks are scheduled to resume on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear exactly what North Korea hoped to accomplish
in detaining the South Korean tourist. South Korean officials, who
spoke by telephone from Seoul, interpreted the detention as a
response to the sinking of the North Korean vessel.
</P>
<P>
   The detention severely tested President Kim Dae-jung's policy of
engaging North Korea despite its confrontational nature. At home
and abroad, particularly in the U.S. Congress, critics say Kim's
policy of social and economic engagement is largely ineffective
because North Korea remains hostile.
</P>
<P>
   He had threatened to halt the tourism program, which is the
countries' largest joint commercial venture, and a major source of
income for North Korea, if the woman was not released.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Kim, Park June-young, applauded the release,
calling it ``a result of our government's firm position to
guarantee the safety of our tourists in the North.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We urge the North to take foolproof measures in the future to
guarantee the safety of South Korean tourists,'' he said.

   BOSTON -- After six days of dissecting medical evidence, nine
jurors out of 15 concluded on a fourth and final ballot that Dr.
Gilbert H. Mudge Jr. was not negligent in his treatment of Boston
Celtics star Reggie Lewis, one of the jurors said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-6 vote Thursday in favor of Mudge came after 38 hours of
sometimes emotional, but always collegial, discussion during which
jurors set aside allegations of Lewis's cocaine use and focused
solely on the reams of medical evidence introduced during the 6 1/2
week trial, the juror, Marian Regan, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 9 to 6 in favor of Dr. Mudge,'' said Regan, who was one
of the nine people who voted to clear Mudge. ``I think it was very
thorough deliberations. I don't think we left an angle undone.''
</P>
<P>
   Regan said the jury did not split along racial lines; some of
the seven minorities on the panel voted with Mudge, while some of
the eight whites favored Lewis' widow, Donna Harris Lewis. Race
``wasn't an issue'' during deliberations, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a race thing at all. It definitely wasn't an
issue,'' Regan said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the evidence she heard convinced her that Mudge had
made a dual diagnosis -- she easily rattled off the now-familiar
medical phrases of neurocardiogenic syncope and ventricular
arrthymia -- and that he treated Lewis appropriately under those
two medical approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible thing to happen. It wasn't Dr. Mudge's
fault. It wasn't Reggie Lewis' fault, '' Regan said of Lewis'
death. ``I just didn't feel he was negligent,'' she said of Mudge.
</P>
<P>
   Regan said she also believes that Donna Harris Lewis -- even
though she did not win the malpractice case -- has acheived her
publicly stated goal of restoring her husband's reputation that was
tarnished following his death when allegations of cocaine use
surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not how I am going to remember him,'' Regan said of of
the allegations that Reggie Lewis, the one-time Celtics captain,
was a cocaine user.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said, she will remember the video played repeatedly
during the trial during which Reggie Lewis was shown with his son
at a Celtics event. ``He was a father and a husband,'' Regan said
of Reggie Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Regan said she dismissed the evidence of cocaine use introduced
during the trial by defense witnesses called by Mudge's lawyers.
``Personally, I didn't feel that it was an issue,'' she said of the
cocaine use. ``There was no substantiated proof so I didn't even
use it in my deliberations.''
</P>
<P>
   Regan, who works in the loan operations division of US Trust
bank, is the mother of a six-month old son, Kyle. She also has a
13-year-old son, Jimmy. During deliberations, she said she set
aside her emotions as a mother -- and distanced herself from the
power of Harris Lewis' tearful recounting of her final days with
her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Regan said the 15 people who were strangers when they first were
selected to sit on the case in May slowly evolved over time into a
group of friends. Before they left each other, at least 13 of the
jurors exchanged telephone numbers with fellow jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very emotional thing when we didn't render a
decision,'' she said, recalling the moments when it was clear to
the 15 jurors that they were deadlocked. `It was emotional for
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Several jurors took off on vacations Friday, Regan said, while
others just wanted some time to think about what they had been
invovled with before speaking with reporters about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Regan said that jurors had to vote twice before concluding that
Dr. Peter L. Friedman had not commited malpratice. A majority on
the first vote sided with Friedman with just one or two of the 15
considering themselves undecided. By the second vote, it was
unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   It took only one vote for the panel to side with Dr. Mark A.
Creager, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, jurors concluded the doctors were ``just
consultants'' who had no direct responsibility for Lewis' medical
care. That, she said, was Mudge's responsiblity.
</P>
<P>
   For Mudge, the jurors voted four times, Regan recalled. The
first vote showed the jury split evenly between Mudge and Harris
Lewis with several members reporting they were undecided. As
discussion continued over the following days, the panel finally
split into an irrevocable 9 to 6 division, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the trial is over, Regan said she would like to meet
the three doctors, chat with the lawyers, Suffolk Superior Court
Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith, and meet Harris Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that ``without hesitation'' she would become a
patient of Mudge's if she ever needed a cardiologist. ``I have a
lot of respect for Dr. Mudge because he could have taken the easy
way out and settled. But he believed in himself and went the whole
way.''

WITHOUT DAD TO DISTURB HER, LUCIC UPSETS SELES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ A year ago, Mirjana Lucic sneaked away from
Wimbledon determined to sever all ties to her father/coach,
Marinko, a taskmaster she has accused of mental and physical abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Croatian prodigy, now 17, had won her first professional
event at 15 only to find her career imperiled by family discord by
the time she turned 16. According to Lucic, the pressure inflicted
on her by her father was so crippling it rendered her little more
than a listless puppet on the tennis court.
</P>
<P>
   So Lucic packed a suitcase, slipped out the back door of the
family's Zagreb apartment and escaped to the United States last
summer with her mother and four siblings, a flight that has, she
said Friday after upsetting fourth-seeded Monica Seles at
Wimbledon, restored her to life on and off the court.
</P>
<P>
   Lucic believes the estrangement from her father, whom she has
not seen in a year, has left her free to love her sport again and
to resume pounding out the high-voltage shots her opponents love to
hate. Lucic's backhand cross-courts and forehand drives were
everywhere in evidence on Center Court in her 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-4)
dismissal of Seles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the past year was so difficult, I had a lot of
personal problems, and then I was injured for a very long time,''
said Lucic, sidelined last fall by elbow and shoulder trouble that
hindered her segue into 1999 and sent her ranking plummeting to
134. Coming into Wimbledon she had played just eight events and had
not won more than two matches in a row at any of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here and really decided to change a lot of things,''
said Lucic, now coached by Joe Guliani and safely through to her
first round of 16 in a Grand Slam tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Lucic maintained her positive outlook Friday even after being
handcuffed in the opening set by Seles' serve. ``I hardly even
touched a ball,'' she said. ``I was just trying to stay in there
and play well; it was funny, but I was really enjoying myself, and
I didn't feel like that in a long time, maybe never.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second set, it was Seles who saw her shots desert her.
``It was all about who hit the ball harder at key times, and she
returned double better than I did,'' said Seles, who maintains it
is premature to write her out of future Grand Slam contention just
because things did not go well here on the surface most alien to
her game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, Steffi, it all came together for her,'' said Seles,
referring to Steffi Graf's French Open triumph earlier this month.
``But so many things for that to happen have to come together; time
will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the event is singles or mixed doubles, everything is
coalescing for Graf, whose mixed doubles partnership with John
McEnroe became official Friday. Graf, the owner of 22 Grand Slam
singles crowns, is not accustomed to providing, or receiving, comic
relief on the tennis court, nor is she accustomed to sharing her
court. But her decision to create a 70-year-old team (she's 30,
he's 40) by inviting McEnroe to partner her in the mixed doubles
was all about novelty.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the sight of the combative gray-haired New Yorker, a
regular now on the senior circuit but an absentee from mixed
doubles for two decades, was a sight for sore eyes at Wimbledon,
where his misdemeanors earned him the nickname Superbrat but his
duels with five-time champion Bjorn Borg enthralled the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that Graf is winding down her career and piling up magic
moments, McEnroe agreed to be her co-pilot in mixed, then declared
them equipped to win it. The ninth-seeded duo took their first step
toward mixed doubles immortality Friday afternoon on Court 1, where
their entrance prompted a standing ovation and their unseeded
opponents, Jeff Coetzee and Eva Melicharova, proved cooperative,
and wilted, 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was meant to be; onward and upward,'' said McEnroe, who
dropped his racket in mock exasperation when Graf flubbed her first
shot of the match, a return, and then received the same treatment
from her when he missed his return. But the dream team quickly
buckled down. ``I'm not totally extinct yet,'' McEnroe said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One player who felt extinct Friday afternoon was 61st-ranked Jim
Courier _ and he felt that way despite surviving a 4-hour-24-minute
marathon against 50th-ranked Sjeng Schalken of the Netherlands. The
28-year-old Courier has won his last five five-setters, but he left
the All England Club without commenting on this one, a 7-6 (7-2),
3-6, 3-6, 7-5, 13-11 struggle that left him dehydrated and in a
state of nervous exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Courier saved two match points, the first with a forehand pass
as he served at 4-5 of the fourth set, and the second at 5-6 of the
fifth set when he provoked a backhand volley error from the
Dutchman.
</P>
<P>
   But Courier, blessed by a weekend off, expected to make a full
recovery in time to play upset artist and villain in his round of
16 match with this tournament's resident hero, sixth-seeded Tim
Henman, who advanced with a 6-1, 6-7 (8-10), 6-3, 6-2 defeat of
Sebastien Grosjean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a big-match player; that's the best way to put
it,'' said Henman, who downplayed their 55-spot ranking disparity.
``When it's a big occasion, that ranking is perhaps lying a little
bit. I think it's fair to say it's why I've practiced, to play on
Center Court in these type of matches, and I'm sure it's the same
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing round of 16 confrontation on the women's
side will belong to two teen-agers, sixth-seeded Venus Williams,
who needed just 45 minutes Friday to subdue Sarah Pitkowski, 6-1,
6-1, and 17th-seeded Anna Kournikova, who advanced with a 7-5, 3-1
victory after her opponent, Ines Gorrochategui, withdrew with
injuries to her knee and shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to become upset or a statistic,'' said Williams,
who leads their rivalry, 2-0, but evidently regards Kournikova as
one of the more dangerous threats among the teen peer group. ``She
has a lot of strengths. She has a solid backhand and forehand and a
nice serve and moves well. It's going to be the person who comes in
more and takes more opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova, a semifinalist here in 1997, said she intended to
treat the encounter like a chess match on grass. ``She has a big
serve, she's a big girl, so I have to just out-think her,''
Kournikova said. ``Grass is obviously not her favorite surface, so
we'll see; I'll just have to play smarter.''

   PARIS _ The secret is out ... or is it?
</P>
<P>
   French scientists claim they now hold the clues to a mystery
that has baffled mankind for more than a century _ the formula for
Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   A front-page headline in the Paris daily Le Figaro blared: ``A
Secret Revealed: Any common chemist can reproduce the recipe of the
world's most celebrated beverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The story told of how government chemists uncovered the
ingredients while conducting tests on Coca-Cola to find the cause
of illnesses among some Europeans who drank the beverage.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper didn't publish the formula, and the scoop seemed
the least of Coke's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any competent chemist can figure out what's in Coca-Cola,''
company spokesman Paul Pendergrass said. ``But there's a big
difference between knowing the ingredients and knowing how it's
made.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual handwritten formula remains locked in a bank vault in
Atlanta, so the secret, it seems, remains safe after all.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27)  
 (af)  
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Two words sum up the management philosophy of the
Enron Corp., according to its president, Jeffrey K. Skilling:
loose, and tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are loose on everything related to creativity,'' said
Skilling, who came here in 1990 to help transform Enron from a
regulated natural-gas pipeline company into the energy industry's
most freewheeling cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to have smart people try new things,'' said Skilling,
45. While other energy companies collect engineers, Enron has hired
hundreds of MBAs in recent years from top universities _ about 150
this year alone _ and even the occasional liberal-arts major just
out of college. ``We stick them in the organization and tell them
to figure something out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So where does ``tight'' figure in? With intense controls,
imposed whenever Enron signs a long-term contract to deliver a
commodity, like gas _ a $600 million computer system tracks the
company's financial exposures _ or when it comes time to evaluate
those smart people's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Risk-taking, anytime, is managed centrally,'' Skilling
explained.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a decade, lassoing loose and tight into a single
strategy, Enron has emerged from its unlikely perch in the utility
industry as a model for the new American workplace _ every bit as
much as the Silicon Valley start-ups that usually come to mind when
the subject is entrepreneurship or innovation.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the company has opened huge new profit centers:
by building power plants and pipelines in Asia, Europe, Latin
America and the United States; trading natural gas and electricity
in wholesale markets at home and overseas, and applying its
financial expertise to create hedging instruments for the energy
industry and other commodity businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock, meanwhile, has sharply outperformed the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 through the '90s _ a time when its old peers in the gas
business have badly lagged behind the market.
</P>
<P>
   New management approaches abound: Walls have fallen within its
57-story headquarters tower, the better to promote
cross-pollinating conversations. Through internships and mentor
programs, seasoned executives help even the lowest-ranking new
employees find an interest _ and then challenge them to start a new
business for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Skilling says he does not care how people dress when they come
to work, or whether expense accounts are filed on time. Or even if,
after an all-out effort, a venture fails _ like Enron's heavily
publicized push two years ago to become the nation's leading retail
marketer of electricity, as states like California opened the power
business to competition.
</P>
<P>
   The executive who led that effort is now in charge of spending
perhaps eight times as much to sell long-term power contracts to
big companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try new things,'' Skilling said, ``some will work, some
won't.''
</P>
<P>
   What is it like to work in such an environment? To hear Enron
employees tell their stories, it's a tightrope walk _ exhilarating,
if sometimes scary.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours with David W. Cox is as exhausting as a full day with
someone else. Nearly 6 feet tall, Cox, 36, is a blur of motion on a
45th-story trading floor, where he oversees a staff of 30 as a vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Their business is one that Cox invented: writing swaps contracts
that allow big consumers like newspaper publishers to hedge against
fluctuations in the price of paper.
</P>
<P>
   Enron wrote $4 billion of the contracts in 1998. And Cox, who
started the '90s working in the basement as a $5-an-hour graphics
clerk, sounds amazed that he is ending the decade heading one of
the company's fastest-growing new enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   For Cox, the door to entrepreneurship was opened directly by
Skilling. Then a newcomer himself to Enron, Skilling, a former
consultant at McKinsey &AMP; Co., was building the company's wholesale
trading of natural gas, and Cox was helping to prepare materials
for his presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Skilling, he said, was constantly challenging employees to find
ways to take advantage of the turmoil that impending deregulation
had unleashed in the gas industry. ``He made us feel that there was
nothing that we could not do,'' Cox recalled.
</P>
<P>
   After three years, he persuaded Skilling to find an outside
concern to handle Enron's graphics needs _ and then left to join,
and eventually buy, the small company that absorbed the work. About
25 Enron employees went with him.
</P>
<P>
   The business grew quickly. Cox was soon also supplying graphics
for Conseco, the insurer, and Sprint, the long-distance telephone
company, offering long-term contracts for the service at a fixed
price that included the cost of paper.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, though, paper prices surged, doubling because of high
demand and tight manufacturing capacity. Put on the spot, Cox tried
to freeze his paper costs, but was rebuffed by every producer or
broker.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing an opening, he got in touch with big paper consumers.
Historically, those buyers had simply ridden the up-and-down cycles
of paper prices: When costs were low, publishers, for example,
would build up big supplies, but that piled expensive inventory
costs on their books. And when supplies shrank, they often had to
absorb quick price increases.
</P>
<P>
   Cox's idea was to package financial deals that would guarantee
paper users predictable prices _ if not the lowest prices _ for the
long term. Publishers would sign long-term contracts with a
financial partner. If the price they paid to their suppliers was
higher than the contracted price, the partner would make up the
difference; if the price was lower, the publisher would pay the
difference to its partner in the hedge.
</P>
<P>
   The deals would be very much like those Enron was making with
users of natural gas and other commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he convinced the Times Mirror Co. and Media News
Group, both publishers of big-city newspapers, that the concept had
merit. Next, he called his mentor, Skilling, who quickly embraced
the idea as a logical extension of Enron's financial deal-making.
He invited Cox to return to Enron to set up the business. The
$5-an-hour clerk would become a vice president with a six-figure
salary.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, paper users have warmed to the concept. The value of
the contracts rose twentyfold last year, to $4 billion,
representing about 1 percent of the global paper market. Cox
expects the contracts' value to quadruple over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Cox attributes his entrepreneurial instincts to being,
literally, a survivor. As a 19-year-old crewman on an oil industry
supply boat that broke up in 20 minutes during a storm east of New
Bedford, Mass., he learned a crucial lesson. ``It was a
life-defining moment,'' Cox said. ``I realized that life was so
precious'' _ and that most anything was within reach if he tried
hard enough.
</P>
<P>
   Lynda R. Clemmons was not a classic hire for an energy company.
She had been a history and French major at Southern Methodist
University in Dallas and then spent an unhappy year after
graduation concluding that investment banking was not to her
liking.
</P>
<P>
   But she had hedged her bets a bit in college, by minoring in
business. And she wanted to work for a company in the middle of
major change. So, at 22, she joined Enron _ where, she said, her
bosses seemed to have faith that she could beat her own path.
</P>
<P>
   Based on her previous experience, she started out working as an
analyst in mergers and acquisitions. But Ms. Clemmons _ who
recently began riding motorcycles (though only after taking a
safety course) _ found that she was more attracted to the breakneck
world of natural gas and electricity trading on the 31st floor of
Enron's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   After transferring to work with the traders, she grew fascinated
with the market for emissions credits, in which power companies
that pollute less than they are allowed sell pollution rights to
dirtier utilities.
</P>
<P>
   As her new job put her in contact with executives of coal-fired
utilities, Ms. Clemmons learned that they had another need: a hedge
against the vagaries in weather that confound energy producers.
During heat waves, for example, utilities must either restart _ at
great cost _ their mothballed generating units, or buy power in
wholesale markets where prices have spiked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had been fantasizing about some kind of product to
protect them against the weather for many years,'' Ms. Clemmons
explained, sipping hot tea at a Starbucks stand in the headquarters
lobby. Enron had been pondering the problem, too, she said, but
``no one had put the case together before.''
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Clemmons did, setting up a one-woman enterprise within
Enron Capital and Trade, the company's financial unit, to develop a
contract that essentially would let utilities buy insurance against
the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, she approached Enron's trading, legal and credit
departments for help on specifics, and checked in once a day with a
supervisor. ``I didn't have somebody holding my hand saying `OK,
this is how it's done,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As the venture blossomed, she was able to get people assigned
from other company areas to work for her. ``You create you own
network,'' Ms. Clemmons explained. But with the added support came
stricter controls, like having to complete a daily profit-and-loss
statement. ``It becomes very clear very quickly if you are losing a
lot of money,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult part of the project, she said, may have been
overcoming the skepticism of older, male executives in the utility
industry, many of whom already considered Enron a threat to their
business because of deregulation. And even more of whom were taken
aback by her youth when she showed up with her charts and graphs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you're younger than my daughter. Why should I listen to
you?'' Ms. Clemmons, now 29, recalled being asked more than once.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, her persistence and cool, matter-of-fact manner
eventually won their confidence. With the first transactions lined
up, Skilling took the new business to Enron's board for approval.
</P>
<P>
   In two years, Ms. Clemmons and her staff, which now numbers 13,
have sold about $1 billion in weather hedges. Essentially, she has
created a new industry; companies like Koch Industries, the
Southern Co. and Utilicorp United compete with Enron for utilities'
business.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clemmons, meanwhile, is in demand as a speaker to explain
her new field. She recently was chairwoman of a conference on risk
management that drew 500 participants.
</P>
<P>
   And she is just getting started. She figures that American
companies with big exposure to weather-related risks have more than
$1 trillion in yearly revenues; utility deregulation and the
weather extremes driven by the El Nino phenomenon can only spur
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've only scratched the surface,'' Ms. Clemmons said.
</P>
<P>
   The business that Thomas D. Gros is building for Enron remains
untested. But his entire career seems to have been aimed at the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   He studied aerospace engineering, worked as an analyst for the
Central Intelligence Agency, earned an MBA and set up a natural-gas
trading operation _ competing against Enron _ for British
Petroleum. He also did a stint on Wall Street with Chemical Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But Gros _ wiry, precise and impatient _ quit that job in 1996.
``I could not impact directly the bottom line of the firm,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So he took a job at Enron, in charge of marketing
commodity-trading services to big industrial customers. And as he
set up an office for the operation in midtown Manhattan, he
stumbled upon his entrepreneurial opening.
</P>
<P>
   To connect his team's computers to those at Enron's headquarters
in Texas, he ordered an expensive T1 telecommunications line. But
it provided far more capacity than the office needed.
</P>
<P>
   The trader in Gros saw the potential for profit in the spare
bandwidth. ``I wanted to see if there was a way to sell it to get
some value for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly realized that he was not alone; many other companies
were locked into contracts that wasted telecommunications capacity.
Enron itself had built excess capacity into its internal fiber
optic network, and had acquired even more with its purchase of
Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He floated the idea within the company, drawing the interest of
traders and other employees. ``When people here see an opportunity,
they want to participate,'' he said. ``We do not ask permission to
spread the word. We just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He was able to spend freely on travel to sell the concept; when
he needed larger sums _ $50,000 in start-up expenses, for example _
his boss was able to authorize the outlay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any budget per se,'' Gros said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company approved his plan to start a bandwidth
exchange and to trade for Enron's own account. His title is now
vice president for global bandwidth trading.
</P>
<P>
   Gros hopes to have his new marketplace in operation by year-end.
But there is much to sort out, from the ground rules of trading to
the technology that will support it. And there is competition: At
least three companies are already operating bandwidth exchanges,
though Gros says the others focus on voice communications while
Enron will offer a spectrum of communications capacity.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Gros is using Enron's excess capacity to keep his
growing team connected. A video link, for example, ties staff
members in Houston to colleagues in New York, maximizing what he
calls informal collisions. ``The really creative ideas,'' Gros
said, ``don't come on a schedule.''

TENSE CALM SETTLES ON BORDER OF ISRAEL AND LEBANON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ After Israel's most severe bombardment of Lebanon
since 1996, a tense calm reigned along the border between the two
countries Friday as civilians on both sides waited for the next
rocket or bomb to fall.
</P>
<P>
   By late Friday night, however, there were no new rockets fired
at northern Israel by the Party of God, or Hezbollah, guerrillas in
southern Lebanon. The Israeli army, which undertook its wide-scale
bombing on Thursday night in response to guerrilla attacks, said it
would strike again only in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Hezbollah stops firing, we have no interest in any
escalation,'' the Israeli army chief of staff, Shaul Mofaz, said.
``But if the Hezbollah continues, our targets are ready, our planes
are armed, and our pilots are on standby.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the fact that the conflict has intensified at a
time of political transition in Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, the
departing prime minister, visited the north Friday to show support
for its battle-weary residents.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak instead tended to political
business and continued the public silence that he has maintained
since he won an overwhelming victory on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who has not been sworn in, issued no comment on the
conflict. ``He is not the prime minister,'' a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts here said it strained credulity that Barak, who is
carefully strategizing his every move, had not at least been
briefed about the bombing before it began.
</P>
<P>
   Cities in northern Israel looked like ghost towns as 200,000
residents camped underground in small, spare and stuffy bomb
shelters. At 8 p.m., after 27 hours, the government lifted the
state of emergency and allowed them to go home.
</P>
<P>
   In the daytime, only the brave and the foolhardy emerged to join
the soldiers on the empty streets. Some attended the funeral of one
of the two civilians killed on Thursday. Others, impatient with
government-ordered restrictions, went to the beach where Katyusha
rockets had landed 24 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, the government, which is still trying to rebuild
after a devastating civil war, met to assess the damage caused by
the Israeli air strikes, which left eight dead, 62 wounded and
important bridges and power plants demolished.
</P>
<P>
   A power station that serves the Beirut region suffered an
estimated $6 million in damages. The destroyed transformers
continued to smolder this morning. Officials estimated that it
would take at least a week for the capital to emerge from its
blackout.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge over the Awali River, a critical link between
southern Lebanon and Beirut, is in ruins. Friday Lebanese soldiers
helped travelers sidestep down rubble while holding ropes and
teeter across a kind of concrete balance beam through the water.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, some analysts suggested that Barak was keeping at a
remove from the bombing so that he could enter peace negotiations
with Syria, which in effect controls Lebanon, with a clean slate.
The analysts noted that although Barak had not voiced public
support for the bombing, he did not condemn it either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot imagine that the action was taken without the assent
of Barak,'' Yaron Ezrahi, a political scientist at the Israel
Democracy Institute, said. ``I think that Israel took keen
advantage of this interim period. They made a huge show of force.
But at the same time, Barak gets to keep his hands clean.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Radio Damascus Friday pinned the blame for the bombing on
Netanyahu, saying that he was trying to sabotage Barak's intention
to resume talks with Syria after a three-year freeze.
Optimistically, some people saw the bombing as a last show of force
by both sides and an overture to the impending negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has pledged to withdraw Israeli troops in a year from
southern Lebanon, where they have been mired since 1985 in a
low-level war with Shiite Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   For many residents in Qiryat Shemona, an Israeli town on the
border, the conflict could not end soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are approaching the year 2000, and still once every two
weeks we find ourselves in the shelters,'' a lifelong resident,
Shimon Biton, 31, wrote in the newspaper Yediot Ahronoth. ``In my
opinion, we must proceed in negotiations with the Syrians, and then
finally we will be able to raise our children in security without
asking all the time what is this boom and what was that crash and
when will the next attack come.''
</P>
<P>
   In one shelter, No. 987, Fahima Flori, 60, said she was ready to
give up on her town. She spoke in a claustrophobic bunker in which
bunk beds hung from the walls like shelves, submarine style.
Children whined and cried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't they just take Qiryat Shemona and make a military
base out of it?'' Ms. Flori asked. ``Then they can help us start
our life again somewhere else. Here it's fear that does the
talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Above, grief was speaking, as a few hundred people, mostly men,
gathered at the town cemetery to bury Shimon Elimelech, 45, a
construction engineer and father of four. On Thursday night,
Elimelech, a volunteer at the city crisis center, stepped above
ground for some air and to help out when a Katyusha rocket struck
City Hall. He was killed instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Television cameras repeatedly showed the pool of blood that
stained the ground beneath his body. In it was a cellular phone,
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral service was under a concrete overhang, so that it
would be difficult to see from Lebanon. The body was surrounded by
armed guards, and the presiding rabbi was tearful and angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He who rises to kill you, kill him first,'' the rabbi said.
``And we say to the government of Israel, `Hit them as they have
hit us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on television, a spokesman for Hezbollah said: ``We
are not afraid of deaths. We are not afraid of bombs or bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   But it appeared that after a night of fires had raged through
Lebanon, the Lebanese government had turned to Damascus and asked
the Syrians to rein in the guerrilla forces. In the afternoon,
along the coastal road leading to the demolished Awali Bridge and a
Syrian Army checkpoint, Syrian soldiers ``bunkered down'' in the
low dunes that face the sea. They were on the lookout for Israeli
gunboats, but none were visible.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Haj had made his way up the coastal road to the bridge in
a minibus taxi. He lives in the south, but makes his living selling
vegetables in Beirut, and he was intent not to be derailed by the
bombardment. Haj climbed up a steep, makeshift walkway to the top
of the ruined bridge, where he was counting on the soldiers to help
him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel wants to destroy our economy to make us vulnerable,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli army officials said they had specifically focused on the
Lebanese public works, and not just guerrilla strongholds. Israel
holds Lebanon responsible for security.
</P>
<P>
   Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani told Israel Radio that
the Lebanese government could ``no longer remain apathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This time,'' Kahalani said, ``the pain on the Lebanese side
will be at least the same as the pain on the Israeli side.''

LOCKHEED WILL SELL ASSETS WORTH $1 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin Corp., the nation's largest military contractor,
plans to sell assets that are valued at around $1 billion,
according to people close to the company. The sale is aimed at
winnowing out noncore businesses and, perhaps, providing some lift
to a stock that has fallen more than 30 percent during the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Announcement of the asset sales actually came earlier this
month, but without a price tag, when the chief executive of
Lockheed, Vance Coffman, warned that earnings for the next two
years would be about half of analysts' expectations. At that time,
he said the company, which is based in Bethesda, Md., would
consider shedding noncore assets through sales, spinoffs and public
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, a more detailed account of just what assets could be on
the block was presented to the Lockheed board at a regularly
scheduled meeting. As details of the plan leaked out, Lockheed's
shares rose as much as 5 percent in midday trading, but settled
back to close at $35.875, up 68.75 cents. As recently as last
November, Lockheed traded at around $55 a share.
</P>
<P>
   No decision was taken by the board Friday, nor was one expected.
Instead, the board heard a review that said the company planned to
keep everything it currently has in the aircraft, space launching,
satellite and global telecommunications businesses. But areas that
could be shed include the non-military information services
business, energy and environmental operations, government
facilities management and electronics, including aircraft
electronics.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lockheed repeated Friday a statement that
Coffman made earlier this month that this strategic analysis will
not be completed until the end of September. ``We decline to
comment on any specifics,'' said James Fetig, the Lockheed
spokesman. ``We have publicly acknowledged and announced last June
9 that we are undertaking a comprehensive strategic review. That
review is in progress and will take place over the next few months.
We will make announcements as decisions are made.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 9, as Coffman announced the anticipated earnings
decline, he also said the company would focus on its core military
and aerospace business and sell other assets: ``These changes are
what should bode well for us in the future,'' Coffman said then.
``Defense and aerospace are our core businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Loren Thompson, a military analyst with the Lexington Institute,
a research group in Arlington, Va., said that ``basically there are
two things going on here. First, Lockheed has determined it has too
many different product lines to manage efficiently. It has
determined it's not practical to try to be No. 1 or No. 2 in
everything. So it is trying to fashion a portfolio in areas where
they can be genuinely world class or that have exceptional growth
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Pierre Chao said Lockheed's
actions are part of a natural evolution in the military industry.
After a decade of industry consolidations, many companies are now
left with unrelated business they acquired through acquisition of
other companies, but really do not need.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a step of portfolio cleaning,'' said Chao. ``When you put
together these big companies through mergers, you don't have a
choice about every single business you take in. It comes to the
inevitable point that companies are saying they don't have to be in
everything and now they are having to figure out what they have and
what they should get out of.''
</P>
<P>
   Another analyst, who asked not to be named, put it more bluntly:
``Sometimes you have to get smaller before you can get bigger or
focused before you can be successful. This is an attempt to get rid
of the distractions, the dead wood and the dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Lockheed's potential targets _ primarily the aircraft
avionics business _ resulted in some head-scratching.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's surprising is that Lockheed is finding that the
aircraft electronics business is an area where they cannot compete
very well,'' said Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research Inc. In
this line of business, Lockheed competes directly with Raytheon
Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under such competitive pressure, they haven't been able to
make it perform very well,'' Nisbet added. ``Obviously, what
Lockheed is attempting to do is to trim from its portfolio the
businesses that are the lowest performers and add on where they
feel they can get much better performance.''

GEORGE E. KECK, CHAIRMAN IN HARD ERA AT UNITED AIRLINES, DIES AT
87
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Ill., Va., La., Ind.)   (eds., Milwaukie is CQ) 
(DW) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George E. Keck, an industrial engineer who briefly headed United
Airlines during some of the airline's most turbulent years, died in
his sleep at his home in Milwaukie, Ore., a suburb of Portland, on
Tuesday, The Associated Press reported. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Keck joined the airline in 1946 and rose to the chairman's job
in 1966. But his relations with the pilots' union were notoriously
poor. Airline experts at the time said that as a result, United was
saddled with expensive work rules when it needed every penny to buy
jumbo jets and convert its reservations systems to automation.
American Airlines and other companies pulled ahead in both those
areas, and United was soon swimming in red ink.
</P>
<P>
   The United board blamed Keck for most of the problems and asked
him to leave in December 1970. He went on to run the Columbia
Corp., a diversified company in Portland that was liquidated in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines did not issue a formal statement about Keck's
death. James E. Goodwin, the president of the airline and one of
the few executives whose careers with the company overlapped
Keck's, said only, ``George served United's customers, employees
and shareholders for many years, and we extend our sympathies to
his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Keck was born Feb. 26, 1912, in Chicago. He graduated from the
University of Illinois with an engineering degree in 1932, at the
height of the Depression, and took a job driving tractors around
the stockyards for Swift &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   He finally got to practice his profession in 1937, when he
joined Owens-Illinois Glass in its new metal-container division.
Five years later, he was a plant manager, but his career was
interrupted when he was called to duty in the Army. He served as a
captain of engineers in New Guinea, the Dutch East Indies and the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he left the Army in 1945, Owens-Illinois had sold
the metals division. Keck went job hunting again, and in 1946 he
landed a position as a United Airlines industrial engineer, working
out of San Francisco. He rose to head the engineering department in
1952 and became a vice president in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he developed a reputation as a good
administrator. Two years later, in 1961, William A. Patterson, then
United's chairman, asked him to come to Chicago headquarters and
help smooth the bumpy path United was traveling in integrating
Capital Air Lines, with which it had just merged. That merger made
United the nation's largest airline, and Keck's role in making it
work led to his being named an executive vice president and
director.
</P>
<P>
   During those years, Keck made a high science out of the low
profile. While other up-and-coming executives had widely publicized
and career-killing clashes with the famously volatile Patterson,
Keck treated him with diffidence. So, when Patterson retired in
1966, he picked Keck to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I became vice president for operations and a member of
the board,'' Keck once told a reporter, ``I never presumed to call
Patterson by his nickname, Pat.''
</P>
<P>
   Keck is survived by his wife, Evelyn; two daughters, Leslie A.
Herzog of Alexandria, Va., and Georgia Witherspoon of New Orleans;
a brother, Harold, of DeMotte, Ind.; three grandchildren; and one
great-grandchild.

RUSSIAN LAWMAKERS APPROVE KOSOVO TROOP DEPLOYMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The upper house of Parliament on Friday approved the
deployment of 3,600 Russian peacekeeping troops in Kosovo despite
concern over the high price tag.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian defense ministry told the Parliament in closed
session that the deployment would cost $69 million this year, a
sizable sum for a nation that has chronic problems paying wages and
pensions on time.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Nikolai Staskov, the deputy commander of Russia's
peacekeeping troops, said the lead element would leave for Kosovo
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the constitution, the deployment of troops abroad requires
the approval of the Federation Council, as the upper house is
known. Voicing overwhelming support for the deployment, 158
representatives supported the move. Three abstained. None voted
against it.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 Russian troops raced to the Pristina airfield in
Kosovo earlier this month without the council's approval. But the
move attracted widespread support nonetheless from Russian
politicians, who boasted that Moscow had beat NATO troops to the
province.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian troops will be deployed under a compromise agreement
on command relations worked out between American and Russian
negotiators in Helsinki, Finland, last week.
</P>
<P>
   The United States says the arrangements insure that NATO remains
in overall charge of the peacekeeping effort. But Col. Gen. Leonid
Ivashov, a hard-line defense ministry official, underscored Friday
that the Russian troops will not be obliged to carry out NATO's
orders and would remain under Moscow's control.

U.S. UNDERESTIMATED SERB STAMINA, CLINTON ADMITS 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton acknowledged Friday for the first
time that he had underestimated Serbia's ability to withstand the
NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy news conference, Clinton said he had believed that
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia would submit to allied
demands after ``a couple of days'' of bombing and halt the Serbian
assault on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and the administration were initially criticized for that
miscalculation of Serbian stamina, and then for failing to have a
strategy for a prolonged air war, a campaign that ultimately lasted
78 days.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, Clinton and his top advisers did not concede that
they were wrong in their initial expectation that Milosevic would
capitulate after a few days of limited air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had come to realize, once Milosevic withstood
the first days of bombing, that the conflict would last for many
weeks until the damage compelled the Yugoslav leader to relent in
his campaign of terror in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had been ``surprised and heartbroken'' by the
destruction of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by guided weapons
from an American B-2 bomber, an incident that continues to strain
relations between the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no earthly idea that our system would permit that kind
of mistake,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   On another matter, Clinton said he had misspoken earlier this
year when he said he had been presented with no evidence of
breaches of security at U.S. nuclear weapons laboratories during
his tenure in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my choice of wording was poor,'' Clinton acknowledged.
``What I should have said was I did not know of any specific
instance of espionage, because I think that we've been suspicious
all along.''
</P>
<P>
   He said new information had come to light in recent months,
including that of the transfer of highly classified computer codes
relating to nuclear weapons design and testing from a secure
computer to the personal computer of a Chinese-American scientist
at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The president took no position on a recommendation from his
intelligence advisory board that nuclear weapons design work be
made independent of its current bureaucratic home, the Energy
Department, or given greater autonomy within the agency. ``I have
asked our people to look at it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to answer a question about the peace talks in
Northern Ireland, where militant groups on both sides of the
conflict are required to disarm by July 1 under terms of an
agreement signed in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The parties are in intense negotiations, the president said, and
time is short to resolve longstanding issues. ``This is a very
serious, serious period, and I do not want to say anything that
would make it worse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked several questions about Kosovo during the 75-minute
news conference. He grew passionate when asked why he would not
consider providing aid to rebuild Serbia, which was significantly
damaged by the allied air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He has said before that no Western aid will flow to Belgrade as
long as Milosevic remains in power. He repeated that pledge Friday
and delivered a lectern-pounding admonition to the people of
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Serbian people decide to do, of course, is their own
affair,'' the president said. ``But you know, they're going to have
to come to grips with what Mr. Milosevic ordered in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``And then they're going to have to decide whether
they support his leadership or not, whether they think it's OK that
all those tens of thousands of people were killed and all those
hundreds of thousands of people were run out of their homes and all
those little girls were raped and all those little boys were
murdered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have to decide if they think that is OK, and
if they think it's OK, they can make that decision, but I wouldn't
give them one red cent for reconstruction if they think it's OK,
because I don't think it's OK.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton also emphatically rejected a suggestion from a reporter
that the United States and NATO were guilty of war crimes for
killing Yugoslav civilians and for destroying electric stations and
waterworks, causing Serbian suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO did not commit war crimes,'' Clinton said. ``NATO stopped
war crimes. NATO stopped deliberate, systematic efforts at ethnic
cleansing and genocide. And we did it in a way to minimize civilian
casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the allied bombardment had been the most accurate
in the history of warfare and that civilian deaths had been
minimal. He said several times as many civilians died as a result
of stray bombs during the six-week Persian Gulf War of 1991 as
perished in the 11-week Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has not released an estimate of civilian
deaths caused by the NATO air campaign, but one official said the
preliminary tally was in the ``low hundreds.'' The Pentagon
estimates that allied attacks during the Gulf War killed several
thousand Iraqi civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian reports have estimated civilian deaths at 1,200 to
2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had been fooled by Milosevic when they last met,
at a luncheon in Paris in 1995 when leaders were gathered to sign
the Dayton peace accords that ended the war in Bosnia. Clinton said
he had thought that perhaps Milosevic was not responsible for the
atrocities and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia that left an estimated
250,000 dead and 2.5 million homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a delightful and interesting lunch,'' Clinton said.
``And I thought, well, you know, maybe he had some distance between
the extreme activities of the Serbs in Bosnia. And then he went
right out and did it all over again, and I mean with people
directly under his control.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27)  
 (af)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. _ It was a bold experiment in cyberspace
finance, and at 11:30 one recent Tuesday morning, it was about to
be tested in the real market.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Schoch, business manager of the Lancaster, Pa., school
district, huddled around a computer screen with Louis J. Verdelli
and other advisers here, waiting to see if anyone would bid over
the Internet for $29.2 million of the district's bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes, then 10, went by without a bid. Schoch grew
apprehensive. Then, just as the noon deadline for the auction was
drawing near, the screen came alive. Offers appeared from as far
away as Utah.
</P>
<P>
   At last Schoch allowed a smile to crease his poker face. The
district's first Internet financing had succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The Lancaster auction was one small part of an accelerating
electronic revolution. The bond market is being dragged out of the
dark ages of fragmentation and opaque pricing, and thrown into a
fiercely competitive and still ill-defined future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a thick veil of secrecy in the bond market,'' said
Marilyn Cohen, president of Envision Capital Management, a
fixed-income specialist in Los Angeles. ``It's one of the last
dinosaurs to fall.''
</P>
<P>
   By replacing old bonds with new through the electronic auction,
Lancaster will save $1.1 million, plugging an immediate budget hole
and allowing the city, the thrifty heart of Amish country, to avoid
raising taxes next year. Lancaster's advisers say the savings come
from the bigger market created by the Internet, which drew distant
underwriters who had rarely vied for Pennsylvania school bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the impact of that is to lower their interest
rates,'' said Verdelli, senior managing consultant at Public
Financial Management, the adviser who arranged the bidding on a
system run by a Pittsburgh-based creature of the Internet,
MuniAuction.
</P>
<P>
   Click-of-the-mouse bidding on new issues is a striking leap
forward from past practice in the bond industry. Like most issuers,
both municipal and corporate, Lancaster used to negotiate bond
deals with a single underwriter; in many places, bidders must still
show up in person to drop a written bid into the equivalent of a
ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   And the upheaval in the secondary markets, where dealers,
brokers and investors trade bonds after they are issued, is bound
to prove more profound. After all, some $350 billion of bonds and
other debt securities are traded daily, 12 times the volume on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Most stock trades are executed on exchange floors or through
NASDAQ's electronic dealer network, and each trade's volume and
price is immediately displayed to all. Not so with bonds, which
change hands much as they have for most of the century, mainly
through a patchwork of private channels. Bond trading on the New
York Stock Exchange is trivial, confined mainly to small lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was ever a market that needed liquidity and
transparency, it's fixed income,'' said Douglas M. Atkin, president
of Instinet. His firm, a unit of Reuters, operates the biggest
private stock-trading service for institutions. And later this
year, Instinet plans to start a dealer-to-dealer bond-trading
service, initially for United States Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   While there are big changes under way in the bond business, they
have attracted far less attention than the more advanced revolution
in stocks, where instantaneously available prices have made
possible a frenzy of speculative activity and driven even Merrill
Lynch to announce a plan for cut-rate commissions.
</P>
<P>
   But the impact could be just as far-reaching. Already, spreads _
the difference between the prices at which professionals buy bonds
and the prices at which they sell them _ are beginning to narrow,
eating into bond dealers' profits.
</P>
<P>
   So, naturally, the dealers, are trying to hold off the
electronic tide. And brokers, the middlemen between investors and
dealers, worry about survival in a world where investors have new
power.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in how bonds trade are not always visible to ordinary
investors, most of whom own bonds only through mutual funds. But
ruptures in the system tend to echo loudly.
</P>
<P>
   An example was the virtual paralysis of the market for any bonds
other than Treasuries in the latter part of 1998, when foreign
turmoil touched off a ferocious flight to quality. The Federal
Reserve found itself obliged to engineer a rescue of a big hedge
fund that had bet disastrously on historic relationships among
various types of bonds. Surging interest rates shook stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   But while prices of securities can move at the speed of light,
market structures have been slow to change, and then only under
duress, as when industrywide fixed commissions for stocks were
abolished in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Congress charged the Securities and Exchange
Commission with overseeing the creation of integrated markets for
both stocks and bonds. The bond part of the mandate has largely
been ignored.
</P>
<P>
   But now the pace is picking up: Arthur Levitt, the chairman of
the SEC, is pushing bond market openness. And this month, the House
of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill that would direct
the commission to adopt rules for collecting and publishing price,
volume and other transaction data for corporate bonds and enforce
them within a year. (The measure has no Senate counterpart yet.)
</P>
<P>
   Initially, modernizing bond markets will benefit mainly
institutional investors, but consumers stand to gain indirectly
through their stakes in mutual funds, pensions and retirement
accounts. Taxpayers will gain in places like Lancaster that exploit
the new systems.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And within a few years, retail customers are very likely to be
in possession of basic information about bonds like transaction
charges and meaningful market prices. Until now, ignorance has cost
them more than $20 billion a year, by one estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fixed-income investor is the odd-man out in the market,''
said Arthur F. Goat, a retiree in Short Hills, N.J. ``You're flying
blind.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominated by the giant dealers who benefit most from the status
quo, the Bond Market Association, the industry's chief trade group,
has lobbied hard to slow and restrict the modernization process.
The industry has pledged to improve transparency in the corporate
bond markets, but says it is concerned that the costs involved
might outweigh the benefits by impeding trading activity and
harming market liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   But, prodded by regulators and some in Congress to fill the
market's information vacuum, even the trade group sees the writing
on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electronic trading systems are rapidly becoming essential
tools in the portfolio and trading operations of both sell-side and
buy-side participants in the United States fixed-income securities
markets,'' the association's director of research, Andy Nybo,
acknowledged in his survey of 1998 industry developments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the market's fragmentation, even professional
investors face serious disadvantages in trading corporate and
municipal bonds. To get a market price, they must conduct an
unwieldy and imprecise shopping expedition among a dozen or more
dealers, or rely on what one dealer tells them _ or, for less
active issues, fall back on what may be little more than a wild
guess.
</P>
<P>
   Individual investors, who hold only 5 percent of corporate but
30 percent of muni bonds, have even less clout.
</P>
<P>
   In municipal bonds, for example, the best an individual investor
can do is to view the prior day's prices for the 1,000 or so issues
that may have traded, out of 1.4 million outstanding, on a Web site
run by the bond association (www.bondmarkets.com). Some of those _
there is no telling which _ are dealer-to-dealer prices unavailable
to ordinary investors.
</P>
<P>
   With comparison shopping so difficult, dealers can charge large
markups, especially on lesser-quality bonds, and generally get the
better of any bargain. Quoted prices can be all over the map.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, for example, different dealers were
offering Ford Motor Credit 5} percent notes due in February 2004 at
anywhere from $95.472 (yielding 6.9 percent) to $96.034 (yielding
6.75 percent) per $100.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price competition is at the heart of the free-market system,''
said Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, who heads a House subcommittee
that held a hearing on bond trading last September. ``And you can't
have true competition if people have a hard time figuring out
exactly what they're paying.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a big reason the industry has dragged its feet: dealers'
fear that the traditionally wide spreads in bond trading will
shrink.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are living off the spreads, their profits are
going to come down,'' said Frank D. Korth, a portfolio manager at
the National City Investment Management Co. in Cleveland. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Threatened, too, are the firms that advise issuers and
underwrite bond issues. ``The intermediaries are scared to death,''
said Myles Harrington, a founder of MuniAuction, the firm that owns
the system used in the Lancaster auction.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the company drew a $6 million investment from the
Carlyle Group, a private Washington investment firm whose
principals include former Treasury Secretary James Baker III and
Frank Carlucci, a former Defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
   As with Merrill Lynch's belated decision to embrace online stock
trading, bond dealers are being forced to weigh what they would
lose in narrower spreads against the risk of losing business to
upstarts and the possibility that trading volume would rise if
investors found the market less treacherous.
</P>
<P>
   An early effort to breach the wall was Capitalink, J.P. Morgan's
1989 venture into direct sale of corporate bonds to institutional
investors, bypassing other financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional bond market players howled. ``The competitive threat
Capitalink poses to our industry cannot be overemphasized,'' a
Merrill Lynch official, Richard Fuscone, wrote in a memo quoted in
a 1996 paper by Robert J. Kauffman of the University of Minnesota
and Arthur R. Kennedy III of Morgan. After Merrill bought an entire
issue of Deere &AMP; Co. notes at a dog-in-the-manger price to pre-empt
its trading on Capitalink, Morgan gave up.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Larry E. Fondren, an entrepreneur who ran a
sort of computer-dating service for insurance companies _ arranging
joint ventures and advising on mergers and reinsurance _ tried his
hand. He set up Intervest Financial Services, which allowed clients
to trade anonymously with one another and with dealers, and tried
to negotiate a deal to link it to computer terminals of Bloomberg
L.P., then on 60,000 clients' desks.
</P>
<P>
   Fondren struck a deal in 1995, but Bloomberg pulled the plug
after six months, partly relented, and then cut Intervest off for
good in 1998, said Fondren, who has filed a breach-of-contract
suit.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, Fondren said Bloomberg told him it had acted at
the insistence of bond dealers, because clients were getting too
much price information.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bloomberg, which is partly owned by Merrill,
said that Intervest was dropped because of low trading activity and
that the allegations were groundless.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill itself has had a change of heart since it helped thwart
Capitalink. ``Ten years ago, we did not believe electronic
distribution was in the best interests of clients or the
industry,'' said Timothy Gilles, a Merrill spokesman. But the
markets and technology have evolved, and Merrill now backs
electronic trading, he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the concept is back with a vengeance. The Bond
Market Association says there are now more than two dozen
electronic systems for marketing or trading bonds. At the start of
1998, there were 11. ``It's a brave new world out there,'' said
Edwin McGuinn, president of Limitrader Securities, one dealer that
has hung out a cybershingle.
</P>
<P>
   Entrants in the electronic race include individual
entrepreneurs, banks, securities dealers, bond brokers and
information purveyors like Bloomberg and Reuters. Most focus on
attracting institutional buyers of bonds, whose high volume they
hope will make their systems viable.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, a consortium of seven giant financial-services
companies announced a new trading system for dealers called
Brokertec.
</P>
<P>
   So far, most of the electronic systems are bulletin boards for
dealers to post offerings; final prices are set when trades are
consummated by phone. In a few cases, buyers and sellers see prices
on the screen at which they can count on executing a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Other systems bring dealers and institutions together for
real-time trading or periodic order-matching sessions, with
traders' anonymity a big selling point.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the new-issue auction systems like MuniAuction,
which make possible innovations like permitting bidding on selected
maturities out of a series that formerly had to be bought in its
entirety
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, bidders see where their offers rank (though not their
rivals' specific bids) and are free to raise their bids repeatedly,
as some did in the Lancaster auction. In traditional auctions,
bidders get just one shot.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster's electronic auction of new bonds is one of about 200
such municipal borrowings since MuniAuction's first deal in late
1997. As for corporations, many now routinely market commercial
paper _ short-term i.o.u.'s _directly to investors, bypassing
broker-dealers, and there are systems being developed for selling
longer-term corporate debt this way.
</P>
<P>
   The government's Treasury Direct program allows investors with
as little as $1,000 to bid for new bills, notes and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But while the old methods are crumbling, the process is likely
to take several years _ and it may never make bonds as transparent
as stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Micah S. Green, executive vice president of the Bond Market
Association, told a House panel in March that he supported the
goals of the proposed legislation and said his group would soon add
to its Web site the previous day's dealer-to-dealer prices for 100
or so of the most active investment-grade corporate bonds. (The new
data are due to make their debut this week.)
</P>
<P>
   But he sought to persuade lawmakers that there were key
differences in bond and stock markets. For instance, he said, most
bonds do not trade actively: only 4 percent of about 400,000
corporate issues outstanding in 1996 traded even once that year. He
also contended that too much transparency could increase volatility
in thin markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revealing prices and trading volumes instantaneously could
hurt market liquidity,'' Green said, by, say, making it obvious
when someone was trying to unwind a large position piecemeal. He
asked Congress to choose evolutionary change, led by the private
sector, over government-mandated change.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever path is chosen, it is clear that the bond business is
galloping toward an automated electronic future with fewer
intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, ``if you wanted to sell a block of $10 million
in municipal bonds, you'd call up 20 brokers and ask them to give
you a bid,'' said Peter J. Allegrini, managing director of
Prudential Investments, who runs a portfolio of high-yield
municipals. ``Today, you plug your bonds into the Bloomberg and
press a couple of buttons, and the whole process is down to 15
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few years, perhaps one-third of trades in Treasury debt
will take place electronically, said F. James Claire, director of
taxable fixed-income trading for a unit of First Union Bank in
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   But if Claire's attitudes reflect those of many bond traders,
electronic trading will develop more slowly in markets for
corporate and tax-exempt bonds, where trading is thinner.
</P>
<P>
   There simply is no substitute in a decentralized market, he
said, for communicating by voice with the other players. ``You want
to be able to talk to a guy and hear noise in the background; you
need that color to hear what's going on,'' Claire said. ``You're
not going to get any color looking at the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, screen updates sometimes lag when trading
action heats up, and electronic screens do not leave behind as
solid a transaction record as do telephone calls, which are
routinely recorded.
</P>
<P>
   So much of Levitt's lament about the least-liquid sectors of the
bond market seems likely to linger. ``The sad truth,'' the SEC
chairman said, ``is that investors in the corporate bond market do
not enjoy the same access to information as a car buyer or a home
buyer or, dare I say, a fruit buyer. And that's unacceptable.''

MAGGERT JOINS PERRY FOR SHARE OF LEAD IN BUICK CLASSIC
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISON, N.Y. _ Chris Perry has a father who pitched in the
major leagues and an uncle who is in the Baseball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, people expected Perry to excel in athletics, too. But
Perry believes that choosing golf over baseball made life easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if I had played baseball, there'd be a lot more
pressure,'' said Perry, son of the former major league pitcher Jim
Perry and the nephew of Gaylord Perry, a Hall of Fame pitcher.
``With golf I got to where I am not because of my name; I got to
where I am because of what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   What Perry did Friday was good enough to share first place after
the second round of the Buick Classic. Taking advantage of a
favorable 7:42 a.m. tee time and shooting a 6-under-par 66, Perry
stood at 6-under par for the tournament (136), tied with Jeff
Maggert, who shot a 65 Friday. Stephen Ames, the first-round
leader, shot a 72 and was one stroke off the lead at 5-under par.
He was tied for third place with Duffy Waldorf, who shot a 67.
</P>
<P>
   This has already been a big year for Maggert, who is fourth on
the PGA Tour money list with more than $1.64 million in earnings,
including his $1 million victory at the Andersen Consulting Match
Play Championship. After his 65, which included a streak of four
consecutive birdies, Maggert looked forward to what could be
another successful weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the way I played the last nine holes put a good
taste in my mouth,'' said Maggert, who teed off on No. 10 and
finished with a 31 on the front side. ``I've had some good
tournaments here in the past. I'd like to win here before I'm done
with my tour days. Who knows? Maybe this is the year.''
</P>
<P>
   But the weekend will be wide open. Four players were tied at
4-under par after Friday: Fred Couples, Lee Janzen, Tom Byrum and
Frank Nobilo. Janzen, a two-time U.S. Open Championship winner who
won the 1994 Buick Classic, shot a 67, while Couples, the 1992
Masters champion, shot a 69.
</P>
<P>
   With early morning sun, warm temperatures and afternoon breezes
making the greens at Westchester Country Club table-top firm,
conditions were more difficult than during Thursday's
opening-round. But Perry made the most of his &QC; 5 a.m. wake-up call,
finishing before some players even started and making four birdies,
one bogey, and an eagle at the par-5, 505-yard No. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Perry's eagle came via a strong drive, a solid 4-wood shot that
landed in the center of the green and a 35-foot putt that dropped
into the cup. Showing a steady putting stroke all day, Perry also
made a 9-footer for birdie on No. 8 and an 8-footer for birdie at
No. 10. When Perry gets on the green, he does not lack confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always been a great putter; I have always had a good
touch,'' said Perry, who grew up in Minnesota playing a variety of
sports but gravitated to golf around the ninth grade. ``When I get
the speed of the green, and when they are fairly smooth, I'm fairly
confident that I'm going to be around the hole. Playing here for
years I feel I know the breaks of the greens.''
</P>
<P>
   After he joined the tour in 1985, it took Perry 377 starts to
win his first event, last year's B.C. Open. But Perry, who is 37,
has been very consistent in recent years, finishing 48th on the
money list in 1997 and 39th last year. He entered this week's
tournament No. 31 on the money list ($720,423), and winning this
weekend's $450,000 first-place check would vault him over the $1
million mark for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Perry tied for 42nd at last weekend's U.S. Open, but he finished
the last round in memorable fashion: crawling the final 10 feet to
the 18th green as a salute to the difficulty of Pinehurst Resort
and Country Club's No. 2 course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was funny,'' said Perry, who finished at 17-over
par at Pinehurst. ``I tried on every shot, I didn't play that
badly, and I still shot 17-over par. I had to do something to
release the whole week. I didn't do it to mock the USGA or
anything. I did it as a funny way to laugh off the week, and the
fans loved it. I'm looking forward to the weekend.'' &QL;

BACKLASH LOWERS EXPECTATIONS FOR `WILD WILD WEST'

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They were supposed to see ``The Matrix.'' That's
what they had been told, at least. So when a Warner Bros. marketing
executive told a recruited audience of 15- to 35-year-old men in
Redwood City, Calif., that they would be seeing ``the new Will
Smith comedy'' instead, the crowd went ballistic. Many were still
booing when the lights went down.
</P>
<P>
   The deception had been intentional. Warner Bros. executives
didn't want director Barry Sonnenfeld to show his new would-be
Fourth of July blockbuster, ``Wild Wild West,'' to a test audience.
Sonnenfeld balked, saying he needed an audience in order to gauge
the movie's effectiveness. Warner Bros., in turn, tried to keep the
screening a secret by advertising it as a ``Matrix'' preview. That
or they just wanted to see how the movie would rate with young
males.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went one step further in terms of dumbness,'' says
Sonnenfeld, director of such previous hits as the ``Men in Black,''
``Get Shorty'' and the ``Addams Family'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy backfired when word of the disastrously low test
scores leaked on the Internet. Soon afterward, there were reports
that Sonnenfeld recalled the film's stars, Will Smith and Kevin
Kline, for 10 days of additional shooting to punch up the movie's
comedy. And there were whispers that the picture's budget,
originally south of the $100 million line, had spun out of control.
Never mind that most visual-effects films test poorly and that
movies routinely go back for reshoots. Ignore, too, the fact that
none of the anonymous sources quoted in stories about the ``Wild
Wild West'' budget would have any real knowledge of how far the
film was over budget. (Most reports pin the final figure around
$125 million.)
</P>
<P>
   The stigma had stuck. ``Wild Wild West,'' the big-screen remake
of the popular '60s TV series, has been branded as this year's
``Godzilla.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will tell,'' says Paul Dergarabedian, president of the
box-office tracking firm Exhibitor Relations Co. ``Certainly, it
has a lot of insurance with Will Smith and his Fourth of July track
record. After that opening weekend, however, it will be up to the
word-of-mouth. And right now that's rather mixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Such guarded optimism is a step down from the sky-high
expectations that led Warner Bros. to take out advertisements last
July 4 proclaiming: ``Enjoy this year's Fourth of July. Next year,
it's going to be `Wild!''' The ads were actually Sonnenfeld's idea,
and he now admits they may have been ill-conceived.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it did was put a target on the film's back,'' Sonnenfeld
says. ``It was like we were inviting people to do mean things to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, I wanted Warner Bros. to commit that `Wild Wild
West' was going to be their big summer movie,'' the director
continues. ``At the time, they were also planning on making
`Superman' with Nic Cage and Tim Burton. And I wanted them to give
`Wild Wild West' top priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who plays James West (he of the tight pants) to Kline's
Artemus Gordon (master of disguise), upped the ante by repeatedly
calling the July 4 weekend ``Big Willie Weekend.'' Not that Smith
doesn't have history on his side. He starred in ``Independence
Day'' (1996) and ``Men in Black'' (1997), both of which opened on
the Fourth of July weekend and went on to win the summer box-office
crown.
</P>
<P>
   Never one to back down from a challenge, Smith compares the
film's naysayers to people in the rap world _ ``playa hatas,''
Smith says _ who deride rappers for their mainstream success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing with `Big Willie Weekend' was me coming out
and having fun with the spectacle,'' Smith says. ``But you have
some people who don't like you to have fun or be successful, so
they try to knock you down.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance,'' Smith says, ``one newspaper printed a lie that
they knew was a lie, about how the `Wild Wild West' budget was $200
million. They know it's not true, but they still print it. It kind
of hurt my feelings a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith will probably recover. After all, the ``Wild Wild West''
soundtrack, featuring Smith rapping the movie's title song, is
already a monster hit. And despite the bad buzz surrounding the
film, most expect it to do OK.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Armageddon' wasn't exactly a critical favorite last summer,
but people still went to see it,'' Exhibitor Relations'
Dergarabedian says.
</P>
<P>
   The movie itself follows the ``Men in Black'' buddy concept,
pairing Smith and Klein in an Old West that mixes James Bond
gadgets with Jules Verne science fiction. Kenneth Branagh plays the
villain, Dr. Loveless, a scientist threatening to overthrow the
U.S. government with a steam-driven 80-foot mechanical tarantula.
Salma Hayek is on hand as the scantily clad (token) love interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a romp, a summer entertainment,'' says Kline, an actor
rarely seen in such films. ``You leave your mind out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the inauspicious test screening, Sonnenfeld decided that
the movie needed more physical comedy and fewer explosions. He shot
two new scenes with Smith and Klein and added a pre-title sequence
where a flying rotary blade chases a terrified scientist through
tall grass.
</P>
<P>
   Going back to reshoot what Sonnenfeld euphemistically calls
``additional photography'' is pretty much standard procedure for
big-budget movies. ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' was
altered significantly after test screenings, and Adam Sandler's
``Big Daddy'' was retooled with a completely new ending.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Men in Black,'' Sonnenfeld tossed out the original finale
some 16 weeks into production because he felt the movie lacked
``oomph.'' His new ending: Angry bug swallows Tommy Lee Jones;
Smith blows up bug to save Jones. To achieve this, Sonnenfeld
ordered 45 3-D computer graphics shots, scrapping a $1 million
mechanical bug model designed by Rick Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Says Sonnenfeld: ``You could have written: ```Men in Black''
throws out ending at last minute in a desperate attempt to save the
movie.' Or you could shut up and not do anything and wait and
discover the movie. At the time, we were so under-the-radar that no
one noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, Sonnenfeld didn't take out an advertisement promoting
``Men in Black'' a year before it was released. Big Willie Weekend
hadn't become an American institution. And Internet movie sites
weren't posting terrible advance reviews, which isn't the case with
``Wild Wild West.''
</P>
<P>
   (Sample item from Harry Knowles' popular aint-it-cool-news.com:
``The film wasn't bad. It was godawful.'' Knowles himself, usually
an optimist when it comes to movies, weighed in about ``Wild Wild
West,'' writing, ``I don't think this is a project that's gonna be
saved.'')
</P>
<P>
   To which Sonnenfeld says: ``The Internet is going to screw up
moviemaking, and I really resent that. It's dangerous because it's
all anonymous. These reports are making studios afraid of having
advance screenings because if the buzz is bad, it kills you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What other form of art gets judged before the final product?''
Sonnenfeld continues. ``I don't read reviewers talking about I.M.
Pei's design for the CAA (Creative Artists Agency) building. I
don't hear someone say, `I read the first draft of `Bonfire of the
Vanities,' and it's 1,900 pages long. But everyone gets to be an
expert on movies.''
</P>
<P>
   That's unlikely to change given the general public's
ever-increasing appetites for the Internet and movie gossip.
Sonnenfeld realizes this and already has a tongue-in-cheek plan in
place for his next film, a biopic of boxer Muhammad Ali that will
once again team the director with Will Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we have a start date _ and I've talked to (Columbia
Pictures distribution president) Jeff Blake about this _ I want to
hold a press conference to announce to everyone that the budget of
the movie is $500 million, that the shooting schedule is 18 months
and that we are building into the production 16 weeks of additional
photography.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonnenfeld pauses, considering if he has left out anything.
``That about covers it. What could they make a stink about then?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a question he really doesn't want answered. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   FAME-CONCEPT (Undated) _ Has the concept of fame shifted in the
past decade? Has Andy Warhol's ``everyone will be famous for 15
minutes'' become a cultural cliche? Today the Warholian trajectory
of fame has been reversed: instead of the ordinary becoming famous,
the famous seem to become more ordinary, more like us. In
entertainment, politics and social mores, the high and mighty are
tumbling all around us, or so true celebrities would have us think.
By Caryn James. (Moved).

   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ORFEU-FILM (Rio De Janeiro, Brazil) _ Even before he emerged as
a torchbearer of the Cinema Novo movement here in the 1960s, the
director Carlos ``Caca'' Diegues yearned to film the myth of
Orpheus and Eurydice. Over the years, he admits, as he was working
on the 13 movies on his resume, including ``Bye-Bye Brazil'' and
``Xica da Silva,'' images of what a Brazilian version of the myth
would look and sound like constantly filled his imagination. Now,
after more than 40 years of dreams, delays and dashed hopes, his
persistence has paid off: ``Orfeu'' is showing in Brazilian
theaters and may be released later by Warner Bros. in the United
States. By Larry Rohter. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HAUNTING-FILM (Nicasio, Calif.) _ ``The Haunting,'' directed by
Jan De Bont, is the second film adaptation of Shirley Jackson's
novel ``The Haunting of Hill House''(Robert Wise directed a 1963
version), and once again Hill House is meant to sound as
frightening as it looks. From its eerie opening scenes, ``The
Haunting,'' set to open on July 23, is layered with the sounds of
inhuman conversations _ between wood and air, between stone and
glass, and between an evil entity and its tormented victims. By
Justine Elias. (Moved). Photo. &QL; 
 &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ARTURO-UI-THEATER (Undated) _ Next month, the renowned German
troupe Berliner Ensemble will bring the production of Bertolt
Brecht's ``The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui'' to Berkeley and Los
Angeles. Brecht's drama, a parable about the rise of the Nazis,
thinly disguised as Mafiosi and gang members (the characters Giri
and Givola are Goering and Goebbels), will be presented in a
successful 1995 production by the company's director Heiner Muller
who died that same year. By Anne Midgette. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX-THEATER (Undated) _ Sex may mean a great deal in our lives.
But somehow it doesn't count for very much in our drama. No, I have
not forgotten about the stacks and stacks of plays whose plots turn
on romance, or on adultery or incest, or the newer ones that work
gay or feminist changes on these well-worn themes. Western theater
is peopled with distinctly sexual characters: Oedipus, Gertrude,
Camille, Willy Loman. But the plays they appear in are not
primarily about sex. Plays _ serious mainstream works by serious
writers that shed light on the role of sex in the human drama _ are
actually few and far between. By Sylviane Gold. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JONES/ZANE-DANCE (Riverside, Calif.) _ History has neglected
Arnie Zane, co-founder of the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance
Company. His partnership with Jones produced the paradigmatic
post-modern repertory of the 1980s, but after his death from AIDS
in 1988 and the notoriety of Jones's subsequent career, Zane faded
into a shadow legend, invoked less as artistic innovator than
tragic hero. Paradoxically, it is an exhibition of Zane's
photography _ a solo pursuit predating his entry into dance via
Jones _ that promises to revive Zane the choreographer. By Ann
Daly. (Moved). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BMG-DIGITAL-CDS (Undated) _ BMG's new High Performance series at
the bargain price of $12 per CD promises digital revelation for
classic recordings from deep within the vault of RCA Victor Red
Seal. The new project, headed by a veteran engineer, Nathaniel S.
Johnson, is something of a higher-tech sequel to BMG's compact disk
revival of the RCA ``Living Stereo'' series, which helped to launch
stereophonic sound in the late 1950s and early 60s. By Lawrence B.
Johnson. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALCIDE-OPERA (Undated) _ In a new recording, a group of singers
and instrumentalists from Lviv in newly independent Ukraine has
lovingly resurrected ``Alcide,'' an opera by Dmitri Bortniansky, a
distinguished native of the Ukrainian village of Glukhov who never
thought of himself as a Ukrainian, and who spent most of his life
trying to forget he ever saw the place. Bortniansky wrote
``Alcide'' to an Italian text by the great librettist Pietro
Metastasio during his apprentice years in Bologna, where he was
studying at the expense of the German-born, French-speaking Russian
Empress Catherine the Great. Performed in Venice (once only) in
1778, when the composer was 27, the score now rests in the British
Library. By Richard Taruskin. (Moved). &QL;

<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LATIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ After 500 years of denying the country's
Hispanic hue, the Anglo-Saxon United States is recognizing its
darker cousin. And one way Americans are doing so is by consuming
Latin culture, especially its music. By Peter Watrous. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   JENNIFER-LOPEZ-ALBUM (New York) _ The title of the actress
Jennifer Lopez's recently released debut album, ``On the Six,''
reflects the cross-cultural experience of her formative years, the
record presents a polished urban mix of Latin, rhythm-and-blues and
soul-tinged ballads and dance numbers, with most of the songs in
English but a few in Spanish. By Guy Garcia. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NY-STARCK-ARCHITECTURE (New York) _ New York is witnessing a
small invasion of major French talent. Earlier this year, Philippe
Starck, the most gifted designer of his generation, moved to New
York. If this town cared as much about design as it does about
baseball, there would have been a ticker tape parade in his honor.
Even if Starck does no more than remodel a few extra Ian Schrager
hotels, his relocation here is an important cultural event. By
Herbert Muschamp. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   MAY-STEVENS-ART (Boston) _ May Stevens, artist, activist and
daughter of Alice Stevens and subject of the show ``May Stevens:
Images of Women Near and Far'' is at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts
through Aug. 8. A show of Ms. Stevens's drawings and prints is on
view concurrently at the Mary Ryan Gallery in New York through Aug.
27. By Ken Shulman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT-INDIANA-ART (Vinalhaven, Maine) _ Robert Indiana's home
here, The Star of Hope, battered though it may be, has been his
refuge for more than 20 years, ever since the artist left New York
in 1978 after weathering almost a decade of critical derision. He
created a sensation in 1966 with a showing of his ``Love''
paintings at the Stable Gallery and was hailed as a central figure
in the Pop movement that included Lichtenstein, Rosenquist and
Warhol. By Scott Sutherland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN-METRO-ANTIQUES (Bilbao, Spain) _ The giant caterpillerlike
entrances to the Metro, this city's subway system, are made of
glass ribbed with steel and alive with light. Symbols of a city
reborn, they beckon riders with their sparkle by day, their glow by
night, all part of the design signature of the British architect
Lord Norman Foster, the winner this year of the Pritzker
Architecture Prize. By Rita Reif. (Moved).

LINK TO SUSPECTED CON MAN TURNS PRIESTS INTO PARIAHS IN VATICAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ As priests, they make an unlikely pair. One is an
affable, worldly American bon vivant who zooms around Trastevere on
a raffish blue motorbike and defied his New York archbishop in the
1980s by running a trendy Manhattan restaurant to raise money for
the poor. The other is an owlish Italian canon law scholar who
serves as an emeritus judge on the Roman Rota, the court of appeals
of the Holy See.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the Rev. Peter Jacobs, 73, and Monsignor Emilio
Colagiovanni, 79, provided a clerical cloak of respectability for a
Greenwich, Conn., money manager who authorities suspect embezzled
more than $300 million from a web of insurance companies across the
United States. Both men insist they were badly duped by Martin R.
Frankel, who disappeared last month and is wanted by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The priests say they knew Frankel as David Rosse, a middle-aged
tycoon who claimed descent from the Jewish King David and said he
was eager to give at least $50 million to the Roman Catholic
Church.
</P>
<P>
   They supported the St. Francis of Assisi Foundation, a charity
Frankel set up and then attempted to use to buy several insurance
companies in the United States. He named Jacobs as the president of
that foundation. Colagiovanni, who had his own foundation, said he
went a step further, giving Jacobs' charity power to move funds in
and out of his foundation's Vatican bank account.
</P>
<P>
   With federal investigators in the United States scouring the
records of Frankel's intricate financial transactions, those
actions have left both priests exposed and vulnerable. And it has
turned both of them into virtual pariahs inside the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said there was no
link whatsoever between The Vatican and Frankel. He also denied any
connection between Colagiovanni's Monitor Ecclesiasticus Foundation
and the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Yet before the scandal erupted, senior Vatican officials were
also intrigued by Frankel's professed desire to shower riches on
church charities. At least two senior Vatican officials met with
Frankel's American lawyer, Thomas A. Bolan, and tried to help his
client set up a charitable foundation that would be part of the
Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Bolan, a former law partner of Roy Cohn and an active figure in
Catholic charity circles in the United States, met in Rome to
discuss the foundation with Bishop Francesco Salerio Salerno, and
Monsignor Gianfranco Piovano, top Vatican officials, according to
his lawyer, Maurice R. Nessen, and the two priests. Reading from
his notes of what Bolan recollects, Nessen said Friday that the
meetings in Rome centered on how an outside philanthropist could
channel money through the Vatican to support religious causes.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Church officials are highly sensitive to any hint of a banking
scandal ever since the 1980s, when the Vatican bank was badly
tainted by its ties to the Banco Ambrosiana, which collapsed in the
wake of a huge financial scandal and the mysterious death of a
mafia-linked banker, Roberto Calvi in 1982. The pope later ordered
a clean-up of the bank that eventually led to the Vatican producing
its first healthy profits in 1993 after decades of budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Salerno is now secretary of the Apostolic Signatura, the Supreme
Court of the Church. At the time of the meeting with Bolan, he was
secretary of the Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy
See. In an interview Friday, Salerno said he denied ever discussing
the foundation with Bolan, though he said he did so with
Colagiovanni. ``I could not refuse Monsignor Colagiovanni, he is a
judge on the Roman Rota,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Salerno said he told other Vatican officials that
``hypothetically'' nothing would legally prevent an American
financier from opening a charitable foundation in the Vatican.
``The Vatican is a sovereign state, anything can be done, but the
question is will it be authorized,'' Salerno said.
</P>
<P>
   Nessen, Bolan's attorney, said that his client had a later
meeting with Piovano, an assistant Vatican secretary of state, who
disagreed with Salerno, pointing out that Frankel could not be
allowed to control a Vatican foundation's assets, especially since
Frankel also wished to invest in insurance companies in America.
Eventually, however, the two sides worked out a compromise: the
Monitor Ecclesiasticus Foundation, Colagiovanni's cultural and
charitable organization, could act as ``founder'' _ in legal terms
as ``settlor'' _ of a new, independent foundation controlled by
Frankel. According to Nessen, the new foundation would be named
after St. Francis of Assisi and could claim links to the Vatican,
as Frankel desired. Nessen said that Salerno was aware of and
approved this arrangement in advance. Asked in writing to respond,
Salerno did not reply.
</P>
<P>
   But after Frankel's suspected embezzlement schemes came to
light, the Vatican sought to distance itself from the American's
associates in the church.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro-Valls described Colagiovanni, who as president of the
Monitor Ecclesiasticus edits a Vatican-approved canonical law
quarterly and also runs its charitable arm, as a ``pensioner.''
Navarro-Valls said he knew nothing about Jacobs, but volunteered
that he was an ``ex-Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   Salerno also pointed out Jacobs' Jewish roots after the scandal
surfaced. Neither he nor Navarro-Valls nor others mentioned the
fact that Jacobs was formally rebuked by the Catholic Church in
1983, after he ignored an archbishop's order to cease operating his
New York restaurant, The Palantine. Jacobs' right to perform
priestly duties was suspended at that time because he violated
church rules about business transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, who continued to serve Mass and perform weddings, said
in an interview that he believed his suspension was reversed in
1987 after he gave up the business. According to his archdiocese in
Washington, however, the suspension was reversed, but not the ban
on giving sacraments.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Priestly faculties are like a medical license, and Father
Jacobs' were never restored,'' William E. Lori, auxiliary bishop of
the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C, explained on Thursday. ``The
sacraments he performed since 1983 are not valid.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs was born in New Hampshire, the son of a Jewish father and
an Irish Catholic mother. Jacobs was baptised as a Catholic, but he
only began practicing his faith while serving in the Navy during
World war II. He was ordained in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   In his long, colorful and highly unorthodox career as a priest,
he has made interfaith marriages a specialty. It was, in fact, an
interfaith society wedding that brought Jacobs and Colagiovanni
together in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; They first met, Colagiovanni recalled in an interview, at the
Vatican Bank, known as the Instituto per Le Opere Religiose.
Colagiovanni's foundation has an account there. Jacobs said that he
was there visiting old friends who worked in the bank.

<P>
   ``He is a very social fellow,'' Colagiovanni said of Jacobs.
Soon after that meeting, Jacobs sought out Colagiovanni's expertise
in arranging a Catholic Church wedding for a divorced Jewish groom
and a Catholic bride. Colagiovanni said he had no idea at the time
he was helping one of America's wealthiest men, Edgar Bronfman Jr.,
president of Seagram Co., marry Clarissa Alcock, the daughter of an
oil executive, in Caracas, Venezuela. Jacobs said he officiated at
the service, alongside a local priest and a rabbi, over the
objections of the local cardinal. An associate of the Bronfman
family said that this was untrue, and that the local priest had
officiated, with Jacobs serving as a ``greeter.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, who has worked in the slums of New York and Washington,
D.C., also hobnobs with European aristocrats and counts the late
Princess Grace of Monaco, Walter Cronkite, Arrigo Cipriani, the
owner of Harry's Bar, among his many well-heeled friends. Another
one was was Bolan.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, Colagiovanni said he got another call from
Jacobs when he was on holiday in Cleveland. ``He told me there was
a Jewish millionaire who wanted to do good things for the church
and the poor,'' Colagiovanno recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He flew at Frankel's expense to New York, where he and Jacobs
and Bolan had dinner. Jacobs said he had known Bolan for 30 years
and had helped him through a variety of family crises.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the dinner, all three men drove to Greenwich, Conn.,
to meet the aspiring benefactor. Both priests said they were
surprised and impressed by Frankel's library, which was crammed
with books on Catholicism, ranging from papal encyclicals to
biographies of saints, including hundreds of tomes devoted to St.
Francis of Assisi. ``He had actually read the encyclicals,'' Jacobs
said. ``Even I haven't read them all.''
</P>
<P>
   But the priest also noticed Frankel's weird side, particularly
his obsessive fear of germs. ``He reminded me of the Jack Nicholson
character in `As Good as It Gets,' who he kept washing his hands
over and over,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Colagiovanni, like Jacobs, received from Frankel a 13-page
autobiographical sketch that laid out his financial credentials and
his piety. Colagiovanni said he was convinced of Frankel's good
intentions, but he said that when Frankel explained his desire to
give $50 million to Catholic charities by setting up his own
foundation at the Vatican, he told him that was impossible. ``I
explained no lay person could bank there,'' Colagiovanni said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he encouraged Frankel to start his own private
foundation. But Frankel was apparently so keen to bank at the
Vatican that he dispatched his lawyer, Bolan, to Rome by Concorde
to meet with Vatican officials.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides eventually settled on the compromise and founded
the St. Francis Foundation. Jacobs said that he learned that he was
appointed a trustee and president of the foundation after seeing
his name on a document.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel also ardently pursued celebrities to add legitimacy to
his organization, sometimes even after they declined to support
him. Lee Iacocca, the former Chrysler chairman, rejected Frankel's
overtures to serve on the St. Francis foundation board. But Frankel
did not readily accept no for an answer: He paid for Iacocca to fly
on a leased Gulfstream IV executive jet from Los Angeles to Milan,
Italy, where Iacocca attended to some personal and business
affairs, a spokeswoman for Iacocca said. She said that the retired
auto executive was not initially informed about how the trip was
paid for.
</P>
<P>
   And Frankel pressured Jacobs to use his own connections. Walter
Cronkite said that he had received and rejected a request from
Jacobs to serve on the advisory board. After that conversation,
Cronkite heard nothing more about the matter until early May, when
he got a voice mail at his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father Pete called and left a very cryptic message,'' Cronkite
said. ``He said, `The man who has given a billion dollars has
apparently absconded with the money, the whole thing is a mess. I'm
sorry I listed you as a member of the board of advisors. I hope it
doesn't cause you any problems.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That was the first time Cronkite heard that Jacobs had put his
name on the list of advisors. ``It was very much of a surprise,''
he said. ``I would not have thought that he would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Colagiovanni said that he told Frankel he did not want to be
involved with collecting or investing money. He signed over to
Jacobs, president of the St. Francis Foundation, the right to use
the bank account of the Monitor Ecclesiaticus Foundation, which is
in the Vatican bank. But Frankel apparently never tapped that
source: both priests said that Frankel never sent any money to
either foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel instead used Colagiovanni's connections in a different
way, persuading the priest to sign a November 1998 affadavit that
stated that money contributed to the St. Francis Foundation came
from ``funds of the Holy See.'' Frankel's lawyers used that
document to support their claims that Frankel's charity and
business dealings had the approval of the Vatican. Colagiovanni now
says that the affadavit was misleading, and that he should not have
signed it. ``I trusted him,'' he explained.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before Broadway ever imagined a Shark or a Jet,
Robert DeSena knew all there was to know about turf and colors,
about ethnic feuds and the sting of a punch thrown in a rumble.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager in the days of doo-wop, when gangs had names like
the Fordham Baldies and the Bergen Street Dukes, he ran with his
own crew in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, called the 86th
Street Boys. ``I could deliver 300 guys; that's what I was known
for,'' said DeSena, now 57.
</P>
<P>
   As an English teacher, 20 years later, DeSena stepped in to make
peace between battling Italians and blacks at John Dewey High
School in Brooklyn in 1975, carving from that experience an
organization known as the Council for Unity. Today, the council is
still being called into New York City public schools, like Herbert
H. Lehman and Christopher Columbus High Schools in the northeast
Bronx, to keep things calm.
</P>
<P>
   At these schools, DeSena and his program are being used to ease
simmering tensions between blacks and whites, Bloods and Crips,
Latin Kings and Albanians, and other groups that have had a history
of antagonism. But DeSena says he has encountered a significant
obstacle to any lasting accord: the Albanian teen-agers, a central
group whose numbers are swelling with the arrival of Kosovar
refugees, have not sat down with the others.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated by the circumstances of their recent migration and at
times mistrustful of outsiders, many Albanian youths have balked
for 16 months at joining the Bloods and the Zulus, the Latin Kings
and the Netas in the circle of desks at Lehman where the council
mediates disputes and brokers harmony.
</P>
<P>
   DeSena fears a similar reception at Columbus, where the number
of Albanian students is larger and where the council will set up an
identical program in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not hypothetical. Although neither Columbus nor
Lehman is besieged by violence, there are gang flare-ups outside
the schools, the majority of them escalating from small
misunderstandings. In the most recent one, which took place six
weeks ago outside Lehman, the Bloods, who claim the colors red and
black as their own, spotted a teen-ager outside the school wearing
a red and black Albanian flag as a bandanna.
</P>
<P>
   It became a matter of honor: Blood pride versus the sort of
ethnic identification that led young Albanian-Americans to Kosovo
to battle Serbs. The fight engulfed about 15 students. One of them,
a Blood, was badly beaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that that's the flag of their homeland,'' said a
Blood who uses the nickname Elmo and was involved in the fight.
``But we don't like it. That's our point of view. We really don't
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Burim Shabaj, 19, a senior at Lehman, said he could not fathom
such an attitude at a time when ethnic Albanians were dying. On his
left arm is a tattoo of the Albanian flag, a double-headed eagle
with its talons extended, imprinted in black against a red
background. ``That has always been our colors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The colors issue has also surfaced at Columbus, Altin Kamberaj,
17, said. ``We are very nationalistic,'' he said, pulling out a
wallet emblazoned with an image of the Albanian flag. ``We wear a
red flag. People think we are doing it just to start trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   When there are fights, the impact can extend beyond the small
number of students involved. Mimoza Novaj, 16, said that after the
fight with the Bloods over the Albanian flag, things were a bit
tense at Lehman for several days, even for the many Albanian
students like her, whose only collective activity has been raising
money for the Kosovar refugees. ``A lot of us had nothing to do
with it, and we got approached,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even their rivals acknowledge that Albanian students do not
start many fights, although they often do not shy away from them,
at times showing up in a group of 40 to redress a slight to one of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   At Lehman, about 100 of the 4,000 students are ethnic Albanians.
At Columbus, the number is about 250 out of 3,400.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't bother nobody,'' said Shabaj, who is in his fifth
year at Lehman. ``We just like to have fun. But if they do bother
us, we go after them. If we have to, we fight them.''
</P>
<P>
   DeSena said the perceived influence of the Albanian students
makes it essential to bring them into the dialogue sponsored by the
Council for Unity, especially as the Albanian population in the
Bronx, estimated at 26,000, grows with the arrival this year of an
expected 5,000 refugees from Kosovo. He is trying to reach the
teen-agers by working through leaders in the local community of
Albanians, whose real estate investments, success in starting small
businesses and devotion to family life are credited with
stabilizing several Bronx neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Although Albanian students have been invited to join the Council
for Unity, many are reluctant to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Albanians like to keep to themselves,'' said Vlad, a
17-year-old from Lehman. ``They don't like anybody looking into
their business. They try to stay with their own kind.''
</P>
<P>
   At Lehman, many Albanian students gather in the afternoon
outside the East Tremont Diner, opposite the school, segregating
themselves by ethnicity as many groups do. The Bloods, for example,
congregate in nearby Westchester Square, several blocks away.
Unlike the Albanians, however, these other groups are represented
on the council.
</P>
<P>
   Several Albanian students said it was inaccurate to read their
ethnic pride as arrogance. One Columbus student said he did not
understand why Albanians were even being asked to join such a
program. ``Why are we Albanians even involved in this?'' Kamberaj
asked. ``We don't even have a gang.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Members of groups like the Latin Kings and the Bloods do not
embrace the term gang either, although these groups have
reputations for violence. Their members said they viewed them as
associations or nations and described their mission as defensive,
not predatory. But many of those groups have ranks and initiation
rituals.
</P>
<P>
   Several Albanian youths said they were simply members of a
tight-knit ethnic group. Some teen-agers, however, have confused
matters by referring to themselves as ABI, or Albanian Boys Inc.
</P>
<P>
   That name is also occasionally found scrawled on school walls,
but officials do not believe it is an active gang. At both high
schools, the principals said that the hallways were safe and the
atmosphere unthreatening. Nonetheless, they said, they support the
council's mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see a problem,'' said Robert Leder, principal of
Lehman. ``But it could happen here or anywhere, and the more these
kids feel comfortable, then obviously the less chance there is of
anything happening.''
</P>
<P>
   At Columbus, principal Gerald Garfin said, ``Tolerance goes on
and then, every now and then, something explodes, creates tension,
and then we work to make sure it dissipates.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, there have been several incidents in the
neighborhoods of the two schools. In two separate bias incidents in
1992, black and Hispanic children on their way to local middle
schools were accosted by white teen-agers who identified themselves
as members of ABI and tried to paint them white, investigators
said. In another incident, outside Columbus four years ago, two
teen-agers were hospitalized after a brawl between Albanian youths
and members of the Zulu Nation street gang.
</P>
<P>
   Donika Shehu, executive director of the Albanian Assistance
Center, which is helping refugees resettle in the Bronx, said she
was concerned that as the immigrants arrived, their children might
be drawn into groups that taught them to distrust strangers. ``This
is not a territorial war,'' said Ms. Shehu, who supports the
council's efforts. ``We have to integrate the society.''
</P>
<P>
   The council runs programs in 45 schools, where it tries to ease
tension by letting members vent and having them discuss set topics
like cultural diversity. Several days ago, DeSena saw his first
glimpse of progress. A few teen-agers in the Albanian-American Club
at Lehman indicated that they would join the council in the fall.
They said they had not previously known of the group's existence.
DeSena said he was delighted that Albanians would be taking part in
the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a global city,'' he said. ``You have to have some
awareness of diversity.''

   (NYT31) UNDATED -- June 25, 1999 -- ADV. FOR SUN., JUNE 27 --
BIZ-WORLD-NFL, 6-25 -- As maestro of the NFL's improbable effort to
export American football to Europe, Oliver Luck decided long ago
that he was selling more than a sport. After all, football is a
game that few Europeans have ever played and that most find
bewildering, with players who have unfamiliar names and do not
speak the local language. So Luck, 39, markets his sport as
entertainment, with loud music and long-legged cheerleaders. ``The
last thing we want to do is to bore people,'' he says. (Kevin

SINGER-SONGWRITER HAS HIS OWN FOLLOWING 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ His albums consistently garner raves. He's an
amazing guitarist. His songs feature sophisticated lyrics and
clever melodies. He's been praised by other musicians and
songwriters, most notably with a 1994 tribute album, ``Beat the
Retreat,'' that includes performances of his songs by R.E.M.,
Bonnie Raitt, Los Lobos and others. Yet after more than 30 years in
the business and more than 20 as a solo artist, Richard Thompson is
hardly a household name, especially in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't my best town. It's a funny, fickle town,'' says
Thompson, whose deadpan sense of humor extends beyond his songs.
``I can do three times the business in San Francisco. I can sell
out 2,000 seats in Boulder, Colo. It's just a funny town.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson, who makes his home in Pacific Palisades part of
the year and London the rest, will be playing with a five-piece
band to a sold-out house at the Roxy on Wednesday as part of a
small tour that he calls advance promotion for his new album,
``Mock Tudor,'' which comes out in August.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for Thompson's inability to go beyond cult
status _ though it's a very big cult status, with his albums
selling in the hundreds of thousands rather than millions _ is his
lack of radio play. Despite catchy hooks and memorable choruses,
Thompson's songs are often too edgy _ and even adult _ to fit into
most radio formats.
</P>
<P>
   Take a song like ``I Feel So Good'' from his 1991 album ``Rumor
and Sigh.'' It's a jaunty tune with a fun guitar hook. But the
first verse is ``I feel so good I'm going to break somebody's heart
tonight/ I feel so good I'm going to take someone apart tonight/
They put me in jail for my deviant ways ...'' and there you know
you're not in pop radio territory anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to stick the jokes into the darker songs, or kind of
have an ironic content to the darker songs,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Working in what he calls the folk tradition of making up
fictional stories, Thompson has explored the subject of
relationships and love from seemingly every possible angle _ from
the more grotesque, like ``I Feel So Good,'' to a tender and
beautiful ballad like ``Beeswing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A love song can encompass a lot of things _ politics,
spirituality,'' says the 50-year-old Thompson. ``Just generally,
the subject of relationships is a very broad one. To do it justice,
you have to dig a little deeper, and you can uncover all kinds of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the ways that he works is by looking back both musically
and personally.
</P>
<P>
   He says he's more likely to listen to music from the past than
what's on the radio now. ``Sometimes you have to go backward to go
forward. It's better for me to listen to stuff from the '30s than
the '90s sometimes, because I see more ideas there. There's more
things that I can be inspired by. Whereas in the '90s there's a lot
of repetition of the '60s, '70s and '80s. There aren't necessarily
that many fresh ideas in rock 'n' roll, for instance.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who begin his career as a teen in the late '60s as
part of the legendary British folk band Fairport Convention, says
that he had a lot of early musical influences. His dad was a guitar
player, and so as a kid he listened to the likes of Les Paul,
Django Reinhardt and Buddy Holly. During the early days of Fairport
in swinging London, the band would reinvent itself every week in
order to get bookings _ country one week, blues the next _ and this
helped Thompson develop his unique guitar stylings.
</P>
<P>
   As for subject matter, Thompson also looks backward for
inspirations. In ``Read About Love,'' another song from ``Rumor and
Sigh,'' he explores how teens learn about the birds and the bees.
It's a comic story of a young man who knows ``what makes girls
sigh'' because he read about it in magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson says the song stems from his experiences when he was
younger in a post-Victorian society.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to do serious espionage work to find out anything
about girls,'' he says. ``There was never anything really out there
in the media or newspapers, and your parents never told you
anything. So you had to find out about it from other kids, and
sometimes it was complete fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mock Tudor'' also looks at the past. Thompson calls it a look
back at London in the '60s '70s and, in some cases, the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The album is all inspired from past events, while trying to be
contemporary,'' says Thompson. ``It's not trying to be nostalgic or
evoke an era. That's just the starting point for the songs.''
</P>
<P>
   It includes the stunning ``Hope You Like the New Me,'' which he
says comes from thinking about his own stage persona and how he
borrowed bits from other people, citing Loudon Wainwright's comedic
side as an inspiration. But he also approached the subject from
another angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about people in the music business who kind of
stole things from you and were kind of unapologetic in the end,''
he says, declining to name anyone in particular.
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson isn't discouraged about not being a superstar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps to not be that commercially successful so that people
expect you to do a certain thing all the time and you feel you have
to live up to it,'' he says. ``So I'm kind of glad I've been
quasi-successful.''
</P>
<P>
   And this has helped him keep turning out artistically great
albums when other of his contemporaries are treading water, or
rehashing old stuff, or have simply packed it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of dissatisfied with everything I've ever done,
really. I don't think anything really stands up, so I'm always
looking to do it better. ... It's usually that question of, `Have I
really nailed it this time?' and the answer is usually `no.'''
</P>
<P>
   And Thompson says he still loves to be on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still like touring, though it's nice to be home as well.
Nice to be home with your family, says Thompson who has five
children, including a 7-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing live in front of an audience is the most rewarding
thing I do, and I love to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson expects to play L.A. again in September at a larger
venue after ``Mock Tudor's'' release.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Thompson admits it would be nice to be more
successful, but that he would be happy doing it ``if there was a
living there if there were only 50 people or 25 people in the
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mildly ambitious,'' he says. ``I don't think I'm a
megalomanic, but I'm slightly ambitious.'' &QL;

BIZ-WORLD-NFL, 6-25 -- As maestro of the NFL's improbable effort to
export American football to Europe, Oliver Luck decided long ago
that he was selling more than a sport. After all, football is a
game that few Europeans have ever played and that most find
bewildering, with players who have unfamiliar names and do not
speak the local language. So Luck, 39, markets his sport as
entertainment, with loud music and long-legged cheerleaders. ``The
last thing we want to do is to bore people,'' he says. (Kevin

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ President Clinton challenged Republicans Friday to
work with him on domestic legislation so ``this summer should be a
season of progress,'' but made clear that he was just as willing to
blame them for failure as to share credit for success.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at Georgetown University and in a news conference
later, Clinton identified four bills as available for quick action
because of broad bipartisan agreement. But one, campaign finance
legislation, is strongly opposed by Republican leaders, and a
second, the so-called patients' bill of rights, has Democrats
seeking very broad application and a right to sue health
maintenance organizations, two features opposed by most
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The two other bills _ one that would allow disabled people
returning to work to retain federal heath benefits, the other a
raise in the minimum wage _ are measures that Republican leaders
seem ready to accept.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, the Republican national chairman, attacked the
president's comments, saying he ``passed up an opportunity to work
for real bipartisan solutions to America's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He chose instead,'' Nicholson said, ``to create issues for the
election campaign of Al Gore and other Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, eager to leave town for the weekend before
the late-afternoon news conference, held a rally Friday morning to
urge the president to back a major tax cut, a national missile
defense and legislation to allow states to spend federal education
dollars more freely. Speaker Dennis Hastert attacked inheritance
taxes and the income-tax feature known as the ``marriage penalty,''
which subjects some married working couples to higher taxes than
they together would pay if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was asked about only one of the Republican proposals,
use of money from the federal budget surplus to cut taxes. ``I'm
not against tax cuts,'' he said, but Medicare and Social Security
must be dealt with first. And he opposed any tax cuts whose result
would be ``to cut education or cut health care or cut our
investments in the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The president spoke at Georgetown about his desire to proceed in
a spirit of ``honorable compromise'' on issues where the parties'
approaches differ, as on Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But at the news conference he assailed House Republicans for
their action on gun control legislation, saying they had voted to
weaken ``current law by letting criminals store their guns at
pawnshops.'' A provision that would have eliminated background
checks when guns are retrieved from pawnshops was included in the
gun bill that the House defeated last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At Georgetown he condemned Republicans over education, saying
their budget sought to repeal last fall's commitment to spend
billions to help school systems hire 100,000 new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want Congress to keep its word,'' he said. ``I think
when you tell people something in an election year, you ought to
still be for it the next year, when there is no election.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called on Republican leaders to appoint conferees on
juvenile crime who would adopt the gun controls passed by the
Senate. Those provisions included a mandate that licensed dealers
sell child safety devices with every handgun, a ban on the import
of large ammunition clips and a requirement that all purchasers at
gun shows be subjected to background checks that vendors would have
up to three business days to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not a partisan issue,'' he said, ``anywhere but
Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   His Georgetown speech also dwelled on the subject of
partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that those of us who work here now,'' he told the
assembled students, ``will be judged primarily by whether we choose
to seize this opportunity to ensure your future _ not just the
short term, but the long term _ or will it be squandered with petty
arguments and animosities and special-interest politics? I regret
to say that the atmosphere in Washington has become increasingly
poisoned by bitter partisanship. I don't understand exactly why,
since we keep doing better and better and better in America. It may
be that some people believe they have the luxury of engaging in
shortsighted partisanship because the country is doing so well.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some in Washington, he said, ``really believe that because the
presidential election season has already started, the battle for
Congress has already started _ even though it's a year and however
many months away _ that the best politics is just to run out the
clock and wait for the next election and hope that the country is
doing so well and we enjoy the lazy days of summer so much nobody
will notice.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, he was reminded by a questioner that
some congressional Democrats also favored inaction, thinking their
best chance of victories next year lay in accusing the Republicans
of running a do-nothing Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton conceded in his reply how widespread that feeling was,
but said: ``Not all Democrats believe that. You see a number in the
House, and I think probably a majority in the Senate, do not agree
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters repeatedly asked him about polls, which they said
showed a lack of support for him, and he replied that the polls he
had seen showed support for his policies.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he understood why he generated such antagonism
from his opponents, he said he was not sure. But he added that
``the right wing _ you know, I've been accused of murder and all
kinds of things _ and it seems, it's almost that the better the
country got, the madder some of them got.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, citing the bitter attacks encountered by Franklin D.
Roosevelt, he said that ``generally, in our country's history, the
people who are progressive, people who try to change things, people
who keep pushing the envelope, have generally elicited very strong,
sometimes personally hostile, negative reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   The president was asked whether he thought his ``personal
behavior'' had made him a liability to Democrats like Gore and the
first lady, a likely Senate candidate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``All elections are about the future,'' he replied, ``and all
candidates are judged on their own merits. And I believe that is
the case here. But I think that the American people know that the
country is in good shape, and that not only our economic policies,
our crime policies and our welfare policies, but our family
policies are good for their efforts to raise their children. And
the best thing that I can do, it seems to me, is to do the right
thing by my country, to just keep working at being a good
president, and they'll do fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defended his intention to propose a prescription drug
benefit for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really think there's any alternative here,'' he said.
``You've got 15 million Americans, seniors out there, without any
kind of coverage for their medicine. You've got millions and
millions of others with inadequate or highly expensive coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The only element of his four-bill legislative package on which
reporters pressed him was the campaign finance measure. Clinton
said his strategy on that bill, which would ban soft-money
contributions and curb ``issue'' advertisements, was to ``keep it
on the front burner so that the discomfort level rises high enough
that an actual vote is allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   He identified Senate Republican leaders as the obstacle, saying
that ``they don't want their people who will vote against it to
have a recorded vote on it, and they don't want to run the risk
that they've got enough of their folks that would vote with all of
ours'' and pass the bill.

BIZ-WORLD-NFL, 6-25 -- As maestro of the NFL's improbable effort to
export American football to Europe, Oliver Luck decided long ago
that he was selling more than a sport. After all, football is a
game that few Europeans have ever played and that most find
bewildering, with players who have unfamiliar names and do not
speak the local language. So Luck, 39, markets his sport as
entertainment, with loud music and long-legged cheerleaders. ``The

the front on the raft, can't swim, so Ms. Lawhorn pulls him on the
raft so he can be part of the fun. Pet Lodge's canine guests get
one-on-one attention with 30-minute walks on trails in the wooded
areas of the resort, playtimes in groups or with an employee, swim
times and even a workout with a tennis ball machine. (Phil

WIFE CALLS SUSPECTED SERIAL KILLER A `MODEL' HUSBAND AND FATHER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Ill., Ky., and Texas) 
 
By JIM PINKERTON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RODEO, Durango, Mexico _ The common-law wife of suspected serial
killer Rafael Resendez-Ramirez said Friday the man she has lived
with since 1995 is not a rapist or a killer _ she says a wife would
know.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say his motive was rape and all that. But I, as his
sexual companion, would know to what degree he had those
tendencies. But he was absolutely normal,'' said Julieta Dominguez
Reyes, who added Resendez-Ramirez has been a ``model'' husband and
father.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez, 42 and a laboratory technician at the state health
department clinic in this remote Mexican town, talked about her
husband as she cared for the couple's 3-month-old daughter, Lirio
Judith,
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez said she is cooperating with authorities and opened
her home in recent days to U.S. law enforcement authorities,
turning over some of her husband's letters, underwear and a guitar
he brought back from one of his many trips to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez, who is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List, is a
suspect in at least eight slayings in Illinois, Kentucky and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Dominguez said if authorities can prove her husband's guilt,
he should be prepared to pay for his crimes with his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, if he did something, he should pay,'' Dominguez said
Friday afternoon in the simple white, stucco home she shares with
Resendez-Ramirez. Her husband's pet dogs, a white German shepherd
and a black mutt, lolled on the front porch.
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``If he was involved in this, if he touched death,
then death should touch him, right? It is cause and effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez said Resendez-Ramirez was last home June 10. She said
her husband received a call that authorities were looking for him
in the central Mexican city of Puebla _ where he was born _ and he
quickly packed a few things and was gone in 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's the one, because he would have to be
extremely cold and calculating... and he would have raised some of
the details in front of me, but there was absolutely nothing,''
Dominguez said. ``He was a person who was absolutely exemplary in
his treatment of me and his daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband told her U.S. authorities were after him because of
his past activities with a group of anti-abortion activists.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez said her husband claimed he was prosecuted in the
United States in 1988 _ an investigation that cost $4 million _ and
the government was still after him.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez said her husband, who often sent home his earnings,
worked at ``honorable jobs'' in the United States, mostly as a
seasonal agricultural worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``His income was not fixed,'' she said. ``He worked at temporary
jobs, picking oranges in Florida, tobacco in Kentucky, asparagus in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   And he also smuggled local people across the border, Dominguez
acknowledged, but she said he charged only $400 apiece instead of
the going rate of $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he took people, one or two people he would take to cross
illegally and that's when he would get a little bit of money
because he didn't charge what they usually do.''
</P>
<P>
   Local police in Rodeo, a small town of 3,569 residents that
straddles the main highway heading north to Juarez and the border,
say Resendez-Ramirez often appeared in town with late model cars,
which he either gave to relatives or sold.
</P>
<P>
   Rodolfo Ramirez Ceniceros, commander of the Durango state
judicial police in Rodeo, stressed that Resendez-Ramirez had never
been involved in any crime in the small town or was even the
subject of a complaint. Local officers said Resendez-Ramirez was
apparently a member of an evangelical Christian group and did not
smoke, drink, attend dances or go out to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an introverted person, he was always alone,'' Ceniceros
said. ``He would ride his bike with his dogs, wearing shorts and a
T-shirt. He didn't have any friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Resendez-Ramirez's mother, Virginia, and step-father
_ a Mexican Army retiree named Luis Mauturino Morales _ moved to
Rodeo and built a small house eight years ago and Resendez-Ramirez
moved there about five years ago. Dominguez said her husband told
her he was the illegitimate son of a musician who refused to
acknowledge him.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Resendez-Ramirez for a short time taught English as
a bilingual instructor at a private school on the town square that
offered technical courses and is run by an order of nuns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very serious. He didn't talk to anyone except his
dogs,'' a police officer recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Said another, ``He didn't have any friends. He didn't talk to
anyone or go into bars; he wasn't friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez said she met Resendez-Ramirez in Rodeo in June 1994
when she heard he had a car for sale. She bought another car,
however, after he could not provide proper Mexican registration
papers for the vehicle he was trying to sell. Resendez-Ramirez
volunteered to teach her how to drive her stick shift car and the
lessons lead to romance.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, they were living as man and wife in the modest,
three-bedroom house she bought on Avenue of the Palms, Dominguez
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, Dominguez still held out hope that all the
accusations against her husband would prove to be a case of
mistaken identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence in him that these things they are checking
on _ that it's not true. Like I said before, if he had done
something over there (in the United States) he wouldn't be going
back over there every little while.''
</P>
<P>
   As she held her infant daughter, Dominguez expressed fear that
``unscrupulous persons,'' tempted by rewards totaling $125,000,
could harm her or her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I fear in this situation, that in some form they
will harm my daughter, use her as a hook'' to get to
Resendez-Ramirez, Dominguez said.

   (NYT31) UNDATED -- June 25, 1999 -- ADV. FOR SUN., JUNE 27 --
BIZ-WORLD-NFL, 6-25 -- As maestro of the NFL's improbable effort to
export American football to Europe, Oliver Luck decided long ago
that he was selling more than a sport. After all, football is a
game that few Europeans have ever played and that most find
bewildering, with players who have unfamiliar names and do not
speak the local language. So Luck, 39, markets his sport as
entertainment, with loud music and long-legged cheerleaders. ``The
last thing we want to do is to bore people,'' he says. (Kevin

Riccobono, superintendant of a district in the Brownsville section
of Brooklyn, in one of his classrooms on Friday. When New York City
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew announced a sweeping shake-up earlier
in the week, closing 13 low performing schools and taking direct
control of 43 others, Riccobono, the superintendent known for some
innovative programs in District 9, was among those fired. His fate
is a telling example of the difficulty in reforming a city's worst

EDITORIAL: CLINTON LOOKS HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, June 26:
</P>
<P>
   After an all-consuming detour to press the war in Yugoslavia,
and with only 18 months left in office, President Clinton has
returned to his domestic agenda. Its emphasis, Clinton indicated
Friday at his news conference, is to get a budget deal with
Congress that shores up Medicare and Social Security, while passing
gun control and protections for patients in health maintenance
organizations. He will also work to alleviate poverty in parts of
the country that have not benefited from the economic boom. The
president's new drive on these issues is welcome. It is not clear
that the partisan rancor left over from impeachment, and extending
into the recent gun control debate, will allow for compromise. But
with the distraction of the war fading, it will be worth a try.
</P>
<P>
   The president reached out repeatedly to Republican leaders to
work with him on various issues. His renewed request for campaign
finance reform was especially encouraging. On the budget, Clinton
seemed to suggest a willingness to accommodate Republican demands
for using at least some of the surplus for tax cuts. His gesture
may have been a tacit recognition of reports that the Congressional
Budget Office will raise its estimates of the budget surplus,
making more money available for possible tax cuts, increased
defense spending, debt reduction and rescuing the big national
retirement programs from future insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching consensus on these issues will not be easy with a
campaign heating up. That was clear as Clinton was asked repeatedly
about political matters, including the possible Senate run by his
wife in New York. He seemed to be defensive about his relationship
with Vice President Al Gore, who sharply criticized Clinton's moral
lapses in announcing his own campaign for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's intentions to concentrate on domestic issues,
NATO's attempts to pacify Kosovo may well continue to demand his
attention. The president became most animated and reflective Friday
when he was asked about the war in the Balkans. To questions about
why he has not gotten a ``bounce'' in his approval ratings, Clinton
said he did not much care. Then he narrowed his eyes and flashed
his temper in declaring that Serbs would not get ``one red cent''
of reconstruction aid until they ``get out of denial'' on their
ethnic rampage in Kosovo and replace Slobodan Milosevic as
president.
</P>
<P>
   As for Congress, Clinton seemed to agree when reminded that some
Democrats and Republicans would rather run on their disputes over
domestic issues than reach bipartisan agreement for legislation. He
was right to say that everyone does better in elections when there
are results to run on.

 &HT;    Lack of citizenship causes beauty queen's dethroning
 &HT;    By Gita M. Smith
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jane Kim has looks, charm and talent _ all
qualifications for the title of Miss Georgia Teen USA.
</P>
<P>
   All the qualifications but one: She's not a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   But for that pesky fact, the title Kim won last October would
have carried her to the Miss Teen USA finals in Shreveport, La., in
August. This week, she had to relinquish her crown.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Miss Teen USA discovered the discrepancy last week
when Kim, 17, could not produce a U.S. birth certificate or
citizenship papers.
</P>
<P>
   The teen was crushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prepared so hard for it. It's a sad loss,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in South Korea, Kim came to the United States with her
father, Chong Sok Kim, and mother, Yong Kim, 15 years ago. They are
permanent U.S. residents with proper documentation, but had not
become citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if I lived here that long, I was American,'' said
Kim, who recently graduated from high school.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kim traveled to Seoul on a South Korean passport in 1997
when she was invited to compete in the Elite Super Models world
competition. That was a year before the Miss Georgia Teen USA
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Did she state she was a U.S. citizen on her pageant application?
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I don't remember,'' Kim said Friday. ``I signed my
name on a line that asked me if I was complying with all the
contest regulations, where they asked us if we were pregnant or
ever married or a U.S. citizen or resident of Georgia, and I signed
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Georgia pageant people never asked me for papers. I don't
want the blame to go on them, they were so busy it probably slipped
their minds,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Whitehead, state coordinator for the pageant, could not be
reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dara Arbeiter, a New York City publicist for the Miss Teen USA
contest, said Keely Wright, first runner-up, now will go on to
represent Georgia in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will turn 18 two days before that pageant and it was going
to be such a great birthday for me,'' Kim said. ``At least then
I'll go and apply for citizenship. I'll do that for myself.''

SPREWELL AND CAMBY SEE FUTURE AS KNICKS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marcus Camby and Latrell Sprewell had their issues
with Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy during a tumultuous season. But
while neither player appeared jubilant Friday after learning that
Van Gundy said he had been assured of his return by Dave Checketts,
the Madison Square Garden president, both expressed a desire to
return next season as well.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, winning has softened their stance on Van Gundy. But
at different times during the season, Sprewell and Camby privately
expressed their discontent with Van Gundy and told friends that
they were not sure if they wanted to play for him next season.
Midway through this season, Sprewell openly expressed his dismay
with his sixth-man role, and Camby has said he felt caught in the
middle of the feud between Van Gundy and Ernie Grunfeld, the former
general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by their abbreviated responses Friday before Game 5 of
the National Basketball Association finals, some residual tension
still seemed to exist. Sprewell gave polite yes and no answers to
questions regarding Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he wants to return. No, he won't ask to be traded. Camby
was more forthcoming but did not want to discuss Van Gundy's
situation hours before the Knicks were to play the San Antonio
Spurs at Madison Square Garden in an attempt to stave off
elimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good that he has his money, and he has his job,'' Camby
said after the Knicks' shoot-around. ``But we can't worry about
who's going to be here, and who's not going to be here. We've got
to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want to talk about Jeff right now. All I'm
talking about is the Spurs. When the time is right, then I'll
speak. Right now, I'm just focused on the Spurs. No hostility
toward Jeff or anything. We're cool, we're close.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, all is well for Camby and Sprewell. After injuries to
starters in the playoffs, including Patrick Ewing's season-ending
partial tear of an Achilles' tendon, Van Gundy made both starters.
One issue that will be discussed after the season is what roles
Sprewell and Camby will play when Ewing returns to full health.
Will they go back to the bench? Will the team revert to a more
Ewing-centered, half-court style?
</P>
<P>
   If Camby and Sprewell have anxieties about the Ewing issue, they
will have the opportunity to express them to Checketts in
post-season meetings. Sprewell indicated Friday that if he had to
go back to the bench, he would bite his tongue and accept it.
</P>
<P>
   Without interference from management, Van Gundy's decisions
regarding how he uses Camby and Sprewell will be more binding than
ever. Throughout this season, Van Gundy endured criticism over how
he used his newcomers. He also survived political machinations and
held onto his job. Despite the personal toll the behind-the-scenes
division took on him, Van Gundy has not reached a point where he
wants to say enough is enough. He wants to return as coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those things are difficult to understand,'' Van Gundy
said. ``But I love coaching, and I love a chance to win. I think
New York will always try to create an opportunity to win. I like
that opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy has already ensured himself $6 million by coaching his
team to the finals, and he is under contract until 2001. Given the
high salaries of the league's top coaches, Van Gundy could land a
contract extension in the area of four years and $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Dave took over, he had told me the same thing: he wanted
me back,'' said Van Gundy, referring to April 21, when Checketts
took over the day-to-day operations of the team after demoting
Grunfeld. ``Now, were the results going to be good enough to be
brought back? That wasn't sure until probably two or three weeks
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston provided some job support for Van Gundy by hitting
the game-winning shot in Miami on May 16 that eliminated the Heat
in the first round of the playoffs. On May 24, the Knicks finished
a sweep of Atlanta in the second round and advanced to the Eastern
Conference finals for the first time since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   During the series with the Hawks, a secret meeting six weeks
earlier between Checketts and the former Chicago Bulls coach Phil
Jackson was disclosed. But during the conference finals against
Indiana, Van Gundy said, Checketts told him he was assured of his
position.
</P>
<P>
   There are many issues to be decided in the off-season, including
whether the Knicks want to use any of their current players in a
trade for a star point guard. But both Camby and Sprewell made it
clear Friday that they wanted to be back and did not want to be
traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy,'' Camby said. ``I'm happy I'm in New York. I love
my teammates, and I like being around these guys. It's definitely
been up and down. The beginning of the season is in the past. I'm
happy for what we have here. We have a nice, young team with a
strong nucleus. I hope everyone can come back here, and we can go
out and do it again next year.''

GAY LANDMARK EARNS A SPOT ON HISTORIC REGISTER 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the setting of an uprising that ignited the gay
civil-rights movement 30 years ago, the former Stonewall Inn and
the tangle of little streets around it in Greenwich Village have
earned a listing on the National Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 70,000 listings on the National Register, Stonewall
becomes the ``first such historic site recognizing the national
significance and contributions of lesbians and gay men,'' said M.
John Berry, assistant secretary of the Department of the Interior.
</P>
<P>
   On June 28, 1969, when the police raided the Stonewall Inn on
Christopher Street, its gay patrons fought back for the first time.
Instead of dispersing, they taunted the police officers and hurled
objects at them. The battle for the streets was joined on
subsequent nights by hundreds of protesters, ``with all the fury of
a gay atomic bomb,'' as The Daily News reported at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting a bronze historical marker on Monday evening at a
party given by the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center, Berry
said, ``Let it forever be remembered that here _ on this spot _ men
and women stood proud, they stood fast, so that we may be who we
are, we may work where we will, live where we choose and love whom
our hearts desire.''
</P>
<P>
   The listing of Stonewall reflects a growing trend in the
landmarks movement to commemorate places that may not have any
conventional architectural distinction but that are rich in
cultural associations, like the 18th-century African Burial Ground
in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   And while the listing carries more symbolic than regulatory
significance, it is a striking measure of how the political
landscape has changed. The Stonewall protesters, outcasts in 1969,
were described by President Clinton in a proclamation of Gay and
Lesbian Pride Month, issued on June 11, as a ``courageous group of
citizens'' who ``resisted harassment and mistreatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Duberman, a historian and the author of ``Stonewall''
(Dutton, 1993), said in a letter supporting the nomination that he
believed the National Register listing would ``serve as a spur to
additional advances in tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Stonewall long ago entered the popular lexicon and is the
occasion commemorated by the annual lesbian and gay march down
Fifth Avenue, which is to be held here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever your feelings are about the incident, it was an
historic episode,'' said Bernadette Castro, commissioner of the
State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. In her
role as the state historic preservation officer, she sent the
nomination to the National Park Service, part of the Interior
Department, which administers the National Register.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no controversy associated with this nomination,''
Ms. Castro said. ``I received not one letter of opposition.'' But
she also said it was important to document the event exhaustively,
since it is ``highly unusual'' to place a site on the National
Register after only 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   A 40-page submission was prepared by Andrew Scott Dolkart, an
architectural historian whose books include the Landmarks
Preservation Commission's Guide to New York City Landmarks (John
Wiley &AMP; Sons, 1998) and David Carter, author of a history of the
Stonewall uprising that is to be published by St. Martin's Press in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The National Register listing includes two 19th-century
buildings at 51 and 53 Christopher Street, where the Stonewall Inn
was situated, as well as Christopher Park and seven surrounding
streets in which protesters and the police did battle between June
28 and July 3, 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings are already part of the Greenwich Village Historic
District, which was created by the New York City Landmarks
Preservation Commission two months before the Stonewall uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Stahlman Kearns, executive director of the Greenwich
Village Society for Historic Preservation, a sponsor of the
National Register nomination, said the listing exemplified a ``more
inclusive approach to historic preservation that goes beyond
recognizing architectural monuments.''
</P>
<P>
   An architectural monument, Stonewall is not.
</P>
<P>
   Behind a plain brick-and-stucco facade, the two-story building
at No. 51 houses a clothing store, and No. 53 is occupied by the
10-year-old Stonewall Bar, which has no connection to the original
inn but which still serves a largely gay crowd and sells souvenir
T-shirts, sweat pants, caps, jackets and rings, all with the
Stonewall logo.

(ATTN: R.I.)  
 REPENTING SLAVERY AND CELEBRATING HUMAN LIBERTY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Acknowledging a past wrong can be a formidable task, whether for
an individual or an institution _ not least for religious
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   One dramatic instance came four years ago, when the Southern
Baptist Convention apologized to American blacks for the
denomination's support of slavery before the Civil War. The
Southern Baptists came into being as a denomination in 1845, when
Southerners broke away from Northern Baptists in a dispute over
whether a slaveholder could serve as a missionary.
</P>
<P>
   Early next month another denomination, the United Church of
Christ, plans a public act of repentance for the role that
Northerners (including some associated with the denomination)
played in the trans-Atlantic slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   The event will be held on July 5 in Providence, R.I., where the
denomination's business session, its General Synod, will be
meeting. Delegates will gather in Abbott Park, a slice of greenery
beside historic Beneficent Church, where they will dedicate a
schoolhouse-sized bell as a symbolic act repenting of slavery and
celebrating human liberty.
</P>
<P>
   The idea came from the Rev. H. Daehler Hayes, the conference
minister (an administrative post) for 34 United Church of Christ
congregations in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   But why do it in New England, a region many people associate
with liberty, either through Roger Williams, the 17th-century
advocate of religious freedom and founder of Rhode Island, or the
resistance to British rule in the American Revolution? Why do it
during a meeting of the United Church of Christ, a denomination
that does not shy from pointing to its historic ties to
anti-slavery leaders?
</P>
<P>
   The reason, Hayes said, is that in the 18th century, ports like
Bristol and Newport, R.I., served as the northern apex of the
``triangle trade.'' Merchants sent rum and iron to West Africa, in
exchange for slaves to be sold in the Caribbean, from which
molasses and sugar were bought and shipped back to New England. The
journey from Africa to the West Indies became known as ``the middle
passage,'' on which countless Africans died.
</P>
<P>
   ``That trade went on a long time,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   When he became conference minister 16 years ago, he said,
African-American clergy members reminded him that he would serve an
area historically linked to the slave trade. Their message was
reinforced when he learned that a social hall attached to a church
in his jurisdiction was named for a family involved in the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in bringing judgment on anyone,'' Hayes
said. But he added that he wanted to keep historic memory alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say forget about this stuff, but I think we do
that at peril to the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Church of Christ, with 1.4 million members, was
formed in the 1957 merger of two churches. If some members of the
denomination in its past, particularly wealthy members of
congregations in coastal cities, had dealings in the slave trade,
the denomination also claims a rich anti-slavery heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Richard Taylor, pastor of 256-year-old Beneficent
Church, which is affiliated with the denomination, said some of
slavery's fiercest opponents came from churches in interior New
England, which belong to the present denomination. He cited the
Rev. Samuel Hopkins, who served in the Berkshire Hills in western
Massachusetts until he became minister of a church in Newport in
1770.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopkins was just aghast at the large number of slaves and the
slave economy when he came down here,'' Taylor said. ``He became a
significant friend of the African community and a significant
opponent of slavery.'' (Rhode Island abolished slavery in 1784, six
years before it ratified the Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   In the July 5 ceremony, Hayes said he hoped volunteers from the
synod would take turns tolling the bell ``in a penitent act''
during the morning. Later, he said, it will be rung joyfully, as a
symbol of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``American history is a complex matter,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to let the past inform us,'' he added, but in a way
that those who study it ``become the welcoming and inclusive people
we need to be.''

U.S. OFFERS UP TO $5-MILLION REWARD FOR MILOSEVIC  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States has offered a reward of up to $5
million for information leading to the arrest and conviction of
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and others indicted by
an international tribunal for war crimes in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and the former Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic
and Gen. Ratko Mladic are the most prominent among the suspects
wanted by the war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Friday at a news conference that the
reward was not meant to encourage the assassination of Milosevic,
nor to encourage bounty hunters, but was intended as an incentive
because Serbia does not comply with extradition treaties. In the
case of Milosevic, whose whereabouts are well known, officials said
they assumed that at some point he might travel outside Serbia and
that the reward would still apply.
</P>
<P>
   Mladic has lived in Belgrade for the last three years, and the
Clinton administration chose not to put pressure on Milosevic to
hand him over when the Yugoslav leader was still the
administration's partner in the search for peace in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic lives in the Serbian-controlled area of Bosnia, and the
Pentagon long opposed any operation to seize him, fearing that some
American soldiers might die in the operation or be attacked
afterward. Others argued that NATO should be forced to arrest him,
but he has remained at large.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing this week, the State Department spokesman, James
P. Rubin, noted that Clinton had recently encouraged other
countries overseeing military sectors in Bosnia to arrest indicted
war criminals in their jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   The reward is being offered under a special State Department
program begun a decade ago and originally intended to encourage the
arrest of terrorists responsible for the killings of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has
discretion to determine the size of a reward if a suspect is
captured. State Department officials said that the amount would be
linked to the type of information provided and other factors, and
that American and other NATO soldiers in the Balkans would not be
entitled to the money since apprehension of war criminals is
considered part of their assignment.

TIME WARNER BOOKS, SIMON &AMP; SCHUSTER CONSIDER JOINT VENTURE FOR BOOK
OPERATIONS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In yet another sign of the pressure to merge that is
reshaping the publishing industry, Time Warner Books and Viacom's
Simon &AMP; Schuster are in serious talks to form a joint venture for
their book operations covering such aspects as warehousing,
marketing and sales.
</P>
<P>
   The venture would reduce operating costs and would provide the
combined companies more leverage in negotiating terms with such
giant retailers as Barnes and Noble and Amazon.com, a person close
to the discussions said.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of the deal, which is inherently logical, had been
sweeping the publishing world for days, but neither company would
discuss it. Simon &AMP; Schuster is the fourth largest trade publisher
with 1998 sales of $564 million, and Warner/Little Brown is the
sixth largest with estimated revenues of $320 million.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, they would have had $900 million in 1998 sales, making
them the third large publisher trailing HarperCollins, which has
agreed to acquire Avon/Morrow. Both would still trail giant Random
House. With nearly $2 billion in 1998 sales, it is nearly twice as
large as its two nearest competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Book companies are merging in an attempt to improve profit
margins by amortizing operating costs over a broader base, and
improving their leverage with the handful of retailers that
dominate the industry.
</P>
<P>
   On the revenue side, the issue is not so much the price
retailers can charge for books, as the clout publishers have to
assure their books a good display in bookstores and on the web, a
person close to the negotiations pointed out. Size also helps by
giving publishers the leverage to see that both potential mega-best
sellers as well as smaller books get some exposure, this person
said.
</P>
<P>
   There had been rumors earlier this year that Time Warner was
considering acquiring Simon &AMP; Schuster. However several weeks ago a
Time Warner executive confirmed that his company was not interested
in investing heavily in the book business, with does not generate
either large profits or rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner already has a large magazine publishing operation
and owns the Book of the Month Club. So a joint venture is an ideal
solution because it has the potential for enchancing the
profitability of a business that is a strategic fit for a
diversified media company. Additionally, it is not necessarily easy
to sell book companies, even if Time Warner had wanted to do so.
Generally the only buyers are other publishing entities.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom sold its educational publishing business to Pearson PLC
in 1998 for $4.6 billion. At the time, its chairman, Sumner
Redstone, said the company wanted to hold on to Simon and Schuster
largely because it fit with the company's other entertainment
operations. For example, Simon &AMP; Schuster had published both
``First Wives Club'' and ``Forrest Gump'' which Viacom's Paramount
Pictures produced as feature films.
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster had sales of $564.6 million in 1998 and cash
flow, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization of $71.2 million. That gave the division a 13 percent
cash flow margin, which is high for the publishing business. Among
the company's star authors are Frank McCort, Mary Higgens Clark and
Bob Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Viacom was under some long-term pressure to
control costs. Last year as part of its deal with Pearson, it
negotiated a five-year arrangement with the buyer to provide
customer service and other back-office operations. While such
agreements would help keep Simon &AMP; Schuster's costs down for the
near-term, they helps explain Viacom's interest in creating a joint
venture that would insure continued hefty profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's authors include Sandra Brown and Nelson DeMille.
Time Warner does not break out the book company's sales and cash
flow.
</P>
<P>
   Two people familiar with the talks said that the joint venture
would retain separate independent editorial operations, but
Bertelsmann, which owned Bantam Doubleday Dell, said the same thing
after it bought Random House, only to combine several smaller
imprints.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Trade Publishing is headed by Larry Kirshbaum, and
Simon &AMP; Schuster is run by Jack Romanos. The two companies are
expected to set up a joint board to oversee the operations.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people close to the talks noted that book companies
are valued on at 10 to 15 times cash flow, so that if a merger
saves $30 million to $40 million, the companies have increased the
value by $300 million to $400 million.

<P>
   PHOENIX _ A Phoenix man who said he stabbed his wife 44 times
and drowned her while he was sleepwalking was convicted of
first-degree murder Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty against
the man, Scott Falater, 43, in the Jan. 16, 1997, death of his
wife, Yarmila, the mother of their two children. A hearing is
scheduled for Aug. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The Maricopa County Superior Court jury here deliberated for
eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   It was undisputed that Falater stabbed his wife 44 times with a
hunting knife outside their home, dragged her to the family
swimming pool, held her head under water and then changed his
clothes. He put the clothes and the murder weapon inside a plastic
container in his car.
</P>
<P>
   Falater said he was fast asleep during the episode and
remembered nothing from that night.  &QL;

 &HT;    C. Jones getting his left-side pop back
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Chipper Jones may have finally found what he's been
looking for most of this 1999 season: some rhythm from the left
side.
</P>
<P>
   In three games against Montreal, the switch-hitting Jones was
5-for-10, all against right-handed pitchers, bringing his average
from the left side up to .264 from .257. Add that to his .371 from
the right side and Jones is hitting .292, matching the highest his
batting average has been since the end of the Braves' first road
trip in April.
</P>
<P>
   This was a long-awaited stretch, especially after Jones struck
out in five consecutive at-bats against the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``My contact is starting to pick up,'' Jones said. ``When that
happens the hits should start coming in. Now it's time to start
getting some multi-hit games, getting the average up where I like
it, hoping some guys get on ahead of me for some RBI chances. It's
been an uphill climb this whole year. I'd rather hit .300 than
anything else (statistically).''
</P>
<P>
   The left side has typically been Jones' dominant side, but it's
been a struggle this season. Part of that comes from having
pitchers attacking him inside, so he couldn't get that powerful
extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams were pounding me inside so much, I got into some bad
habits trying to get to those inside pitches,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   Walt Weiss has been putting his sore quadriceps to the test for
the last couple of days, running a 40-yard dash while assistant
trainer Jeff Porter timed him with a stopwatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to go 68-70 percent,'' Weiss said. ``I talked to
the trainers (Friday) and they said as soon as I can run a little
bit better, I'll be activated. I want to be able to run at least 80
percent.'' Weiss said he's still shooting to make it back before
the end of this Mets series.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Simon was scheduled to have an MRI on his sore left knee
Friday morning but overslept and will have to reschedule for today.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez, who's on the disabled list with a sprained right
knee, said he will not be making the trip with the Braves to New
York and Montreal next week. He plans to stay in Atlanta with his
family and get treatment every day at Turner Field. He's eligible
to return July 6 when the Braves are home against the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty good physically,'' Lopez said. Mentally?
``Frustrated. Going crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves Heritage Salute
</P>
<P>
   This weekend is the third annual Atlanta Braves Heritage Salute.
The following players and coaches are scheduled to run
instructional clinics today, though these are subject to change: at
Adams Park _ Chipper Jones, Brian Jordan, Kevin McGlinchy, Kevin
Millwood, Gerald Williams and Ned Yost; at Gresham Park _ Don
Baylor, Brian Hunter, Otis Nixon and Mike Remlinger; and at Medlock
Park _ Pat Corrales, Ozzie Guillen, Andruw Jones, Eddie Perez,
Odalis Perez and Mets pitcher Masato Yoshii.

 &HT;    Hockey, welcome to Atlanta
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Allow me to perform the re-introductions. Pro hockey,
this is Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about Atlanta,'' confessed Ed Ward,
plucked from the Calgary Flames in Friday's expansion draft by the
embryonic Thrashers. Didn't know the name of the arena that would
be his new home. Wouldn't know if this particular thrasher was noun
or verb. Couldn't name the best local golf courses, although being
a hockey player, he's bound to solve that mystery first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back where I come from (Western Canada), everybody's making
jokes about a thrasher being a combine (that's farm equipment to
you city folk),'' said Terry Yake, the St. Louis Blues'
contribution to expansion. He was interested to learn that it is
also a small, fiesty bird.
</P>
<P>
   What they hear about the city is secondhand; what they
understand about Atlanta's hockey tradition comes from the fuzzy
recollections of childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to a few friends about it,'' Ward said. ``They've
said nothing but great things about Atlanta. I got to know Stan
Drulia (former Atlanta Knights captain) when we played together in
Detroit (IHL). He loves the place, plans to retire there.'' Hope
driving the Connector at 5:30 p.m. doesn't spoil any illusions.
</P>
<P>
   We _ the capital of the New South and the sport birthed by the
hard freeze _ have so much to learn about one another. When the
Thrashers are deep into their inevitable struggles, maybe the
fascination will begin to fade. But, now, it's hard to resist that
new-team smell.
</P>
<P>
   Thus we launch into our voyage of discovery. Even Rob Knight,
the illustrated fan from Kennesaw who won a trip to the draft after
having ``Let's Go Thrashers'' tattooed on his chest, has far to go
from here. Although, I don't even want to consider what his next
step might be.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team that picked a hockey player named Hull, but
settle down. Jody has no relation to that royal pucks family.
</P>
<P>
   Their hometowns range from Red Deer, Alberta, to Dearborn,
Mich., to Krasnoyarsk, Russia. Don't even know how many of these
expansioneers ever will see the Philips Arena home locker room.
They are human junk bonds and Thrashers GM Don Waddell _ who
brokered eight deals this first day, with more pending _ is
apparently not one to sit on his portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   This first list of Thrashers is not terribly glamorous, just a
tad more exciting than the average shopping list.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of meat and potatoes, like Ed Ward. When asked to
characterize his draftees, Waddell emphasized leadership and
character. Ward concurred: ``There's no really big names. What you
want is third- or fourth-line character players who work their
butts off every night. You want to establish the work ethic as a
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many goals in this first batch of Thrashers, a
problem yet to be addressed. Yake, the 36-year-old center, was the
leading NHL scorer on the expansion list, carrying just nine goals
and 27 points from the 1998-99 season. He's anxious to get a chance
to expand on those numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Much traveled _ this is his fifth NHL stop _ Yake also has
experience with hockey missionary work. ``I was one of the happiest
guys in the league going to Anaheim (1993). It was a lot of fun
making connections with new people, getting new fans to fall in
love with the sport,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that first year, even guys who aren't stars in the league
can get out there and be stars in their own town,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, this is pro hockey. And what a good first impression it
makes.

EGO PREVENTS OPPOSITION FROM SEIZING POWER AS MILOSEVIC FALTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to remove extraneous word in lede; no other changes.)  (rm) 
 By BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ For opposition politicians in Yugoslavia,
this should be showtime.
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic has lost his fourth war in a row
and surrendered the sacred Serbian homeland of Kosovo to heavily
armed foreigners. He has been indicted as a war criminal, the Swiss
are swooping down to close any bank accounts he might have and the
United States has offered $5 million to anyone who helps nab him. A
third of Yugoslavia is out of work, incomes are down 40 percent
this year and, according to a credible poll by a private firm this
week, 70 percent of Serbs blame Milosevic for the whole sorry mess.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as has been the case for nearly a decade, the opposition
seems incapable of seizing the day. United in their eagerness to
dump a dictator and end Serbia's isolation as an international
pariah, opposition leaders remain hobbled by their competing egos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Milosevic could not choose a better opposition because, if
it repeats its unforgivable mistakes, he will be in power
forever,'' grumbled Slobodan Vuksanovic, vice-president of the
Democratic Party, one of a cluster of pro-Western parties here.
``We have an ego problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A in the disunity of the Serbian opposition and the
primacy of ego is Vuk Draskovic, the only opposition figure with a
sizable national following, his own television station and the
populist razzle-dazzle to lure large numbers of Serbs out into the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic's haughty disdain for a fractured opposition movement
that desperately needs his charisma, his television station and his
political machine helps explain why democracy in Serbia has been so
much more elusive than in the rest of post-Communist Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Tall, bearded and prone to self-dramatizing soliloquy,
Draskovic, 52, a former best-selling novelist of blood-soaked
nationalist novels, is not humble about his political gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the king of the streets,'' Draskovic said in an interview
Friday at the headquarters of his Serbian Renewal Party. ``I know
better than anyone in the world what could be the real moment for
demonstrations to bring down Milosevic. This is not the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of nearly every other opposition party in Yugoslavia
disagree on the question of timing. They have joined an umbrella
group called Alliance for Change and announced that next Tuesday
they will begin mass protests around Serbia to demand that
Milosevic resign and that free elections be held under the
supervision of European monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must harness the anger of the Serbian people,'' said Vladan
Batic, coordinator of the alliance. ``After Kosovo, everything is
different. People finally understand that political changes are
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, who also senses that the loss of Kosovo will prove to
be a mortal blow to the Milosevic regime, said he wishes the
alliance a lot of luck, but he does not feel like hanging out with
``small political parties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not ready to waste time in closed rooms discussing stupid
things,'' Draskovic said.
</P>
<P>
   As much as other opposition leaders may resent Draskovic's
uppity tone, they tend to agree that without him and his party,
which has been able to turn out tens of thousands of protesters
against the Milosevic regime for weeks on end, it will be difficult
to sustain pressure on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vuk won't call us, and we don't want to call him, and
Milosevic is rubbing his hands together in delight,'' conceded
Vuksanovic, a prominent leader in the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic's hubris is the result of strong recent poll numbers
for his party, his surprisingly successful cameo performance as a
government minister during the 10-week Kosovo war and a new
go-it-alone strategy cooked up by his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Those advisers say that Draskovic was betrayed by other
opposition leaders in 1996-97, when he helped lead three months of
protest rallies in Belgrade that came tantalizingly close to
toppling the Milosevic regime. They vow he will not be duped again.
</P>
<P>
   During the last big round of protests, Draskovic complained that
he was undermined by Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the Democratic
Party and the other big fish in the opposition sea. In the fall of
1997, Djindjic encouraged opposition parties to boycott an election
when Draskovic ran for president of Serbia. The boycott contributed
to Draskovic's dismal third-place showing in the vote.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Never again will he trust Djindjic or other ``very selfish''
opposition leaders, Draskovic said Friday, as he painted a dark
scenario of what he believes would happen if he were to participate
in a pre-election opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immediately before elections, they will start to quarrel, to
accuse each other, to blackmail each other, and Milosevic would see
a way to manipulate them,'' said Draskovic. ``He would use smoke,
coffee, whiskey and be very, very satisfied by the stupid ambitions
of the opposition. No. I am not a part of it. I tried for nine
years to unify them without any success. OK. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A poll last week suggests that, in the aftermath of the Kosovo
war, Draskovic can afford some petulance. His party's popularity
rose smartly during the conflict, from about 7 percent in March to
about 15 percent this week, according to a nationwide poll by
Medium, a private polling firm. The poll, which other politicians
here say is credible, places Draskovic's party behind only the
ruling Socialist People's Party, whose popularity slid during the
war to from 29 to 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, who has been severely beaten and imprisoned in
anti-Milosevic protests this decade, stunned many in Serbia in
January when he accepted the Serb leader's invitation to join the
Yugoslav government as a deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, he attracted considerable attention here and
around the world by condemning the NATO bombing of civilian targets
in Serbia as brutal and inhuman. At the same time, he demanded that
the foreign press be allowed to operate inside Serbia and distanced
himself from Milosevic, accusing his government of lying to the
Serb people about who was winning the war in Kosovo. In late April,
he was fired by the regime, but not before he had shown himself off
to many Serbs as a strongly nationalist, yet sane alternative to
Milosevic's policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prevented many stupid things from happening during the
war,'' Draskovic boasted. `` risked my life. I did my obligations.
I did it by staying in Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic noted that his opposition rival, Djindjic, did not
have the courage to remain. Citing threats to his life, Djindjic
fled Serbia in May and has yet to return. His absence, which has
been criticized as cowardly, even by members of his own party, has
hurt the Democratic Party's fortunes. Djindjic is expected to
return to Serbia next week for the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many of his critics here believe the real reason Draskovic is
reluctant to take on the Milosevic regime is that he does not want
to lose his political trump card, Studio B television. The station,
a real alternative to state-controlled TV, is controlled by
Belgrade city hall, which is run by a coalition of Draskovic's
party and the ruling Socialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Vuk pushes too hard, he could lose the support of the
Socialists,'' said one analyst here who did not want to be
identified by name. ``He could lose Studio B, and then he would be
in the same position as everybody else in the opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about this, Draskovic was indignant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a total lie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most vexing complication in the political evolution
of Draskovic is what exactly he believes in. He has been a somewhat
promiscuous populist over the past decade, alternating between
fist-pounding nationalism and sophisticated sensitivity to the
rights of ethnic minorities. In the early 1990s, he liked to draw
maps showing how big a Greater Serbia should be. He often seemed
unsure of whether Milosevic had erred by starting wars or losing
them.
</P>
<P>
   As with many politicians in Serbia, it is difficult to discern
how much nationalism colors his commitment to democracy and human
rights. Asked about this, Draskovic said there is no confusion at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``My nationalism was always healthy, Western nationalism,'' he
said.

   NASDAQ AND S&AMP;P DECLINE; DOW JONES RISES 17 POINTS
</P>
<P>
   The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 1.34 points,
to 2,552.65, as trading was slow and investors awaited the meeting
Tuesday and Wednesday of the Federal Open Market Committee.
Investors expect the Federal Reserve's policy-making panel to raise
short-term interest rates a quarter percentage point to head off
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.47 point, to
1,315.31, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 17.73 points,

   ECONOMY GROWING AT A 4.3 PERCENT RATE
</P>
<P>
   Torrid consumer spending helped the gross domestic product _ the
nation's output of goods and services _ grow at a brisk annual rate
of 4.3 percent in the first quarter of the year, the Commerce
Department reported.

   PRIESTS SAY FRANKEL DUPED THEM
</P>
<P>
   In Rome, two priests, the Rev. Peter Jacobs, 73, an American
activist, and Monsignor Emilio Colagiovanni, 79, a scholarly
Italian, provided a clerical cloak of respectability for a money
manager who authorities suspect embezzled more than $300 million
dollars from American insurance companies. Both men insist they
were duped by Martin R. Frankel, who disappeared last month and is
wanted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

   CAMPBELL SOUP EARN TO FALL SHORT
</P>
<P>
   Campbell Soup said that earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter
would fall 8 cents to 10 cents a share below analysts' forecasts of
38 cents a share and that it planned to reorganize its soup
operations. Mark M. Leckie, the president of the company's domestic
soup division, will leave the company. He will be succeeded at the
new North American division by F. Martin Thrasher, now the

   NISSAN'S WESTERN-STYLE MEETING
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, where annual shareholders' meetings, are traditionally
closed affairs, Nissan Motor moved to Western-style openness,
allowing news coverage. But the reward for the troubled company's
president, Yoshikazu Hanawa, was a scolding gadfly shareholder who
identified himself only as Mr. Tamura and demanded his resignation,
saying, ``You've made mistake after mistake.'' Next Tuesday, 1,374
companies, or 88 percent of Japan's listed companies, are to hold
their meetings.

<P>
   LATIN-EUROPEAN TRADE MEETING SET
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to increase trade and gain a counterweight to American
global economic dominance, leaders of Latin America and Europe, the
world's second- and third-largest trading blocs, are to meet in Rio
de Janeiro this weekend and early next week. Their first-ever
summit meeting has already proved contentious on several basic
issues, notably French insistence that farm products be excluded
from any free-trade pact.

BURN HAS ONE GOAL IN MIND: CONSISTENCY 
WITH MLS PLAYOFF OUTLOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Blane Bachelor 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Burn is one game above .500, one point out of first
place in the Western Conference and one game from the midpoint of
its season.
</P>
<P>
   But the team is well ahead of where it was a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn's 8-7 record might not look impressive, but there is a
different feeling around the team this year. Last year, injuries
led to frustration. Recovering from injuries and adding a group of
talented newcomers has gone a long way to helping the Burn turn
heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a much different team than in years past,'' forward
Dante Washington said. ``We have the same players, basically, but I
think our attitude and mentality is different. I think years past
have helped us get to where we are now. We're not losing sight of
what the big picture is.''
</P>
<P>
   The big picture being the Major League Soccer finals, which the
Burn has yet to reach in three seasons despite reaching the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to that point will mean, first of all, staying healthy.
Extra attention to training this season has helped reduce injuries,
which will become even more of an emphasis with U.S. Open Cup games
added to the Burn's schedule in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Just as essential will be keeping a close check on the team's
mental outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a history of having a very strong first part of the
season, a weak middle third, and an almost weaker final third,''
midfielder Ted Eck said. ``We've done things a little bit different
in the preseason. I feel each player made it a point to get
focused, do their job and do the things we need to do to prepare
for the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burn's longest winning and losing streaks are the same: two
games.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, some of the Burn's opponents have been a little
more shaky this season. Defending champion Chicago was averaging
more than three goals per game when it jumped to the top of the
West early, before slumping to fall to third behind Colorado. The
Los Angeles Galaxy rebounded from an abysmal start to improve to
8-6. Tampa Bay opened the season 0-4, then posted a five-game
winning streak before going 1-3 in its past four games.
</P>
<P>
   A lot can be said for peaking at the right time, but the Burn
continues to emphasize consistency in reaching the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been real even-keeled,'' goalkeeper Mark Dodd said. ``I
think we can be a lot better; we all know that, but at the same
time we haven't allowed big lapses, which is going to really set
you off course.''
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much summed up a disheartening finish to last
season. The Burn lost nine of 11 games at the end of the season,
but managed to make the playoffs against LA. The Galaxy swept the
best-of-three series, which included a 6-1 thrashing of the Burn at
the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Players vowed to never again suffer such an embarrassing loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a team firing on all cylinders at the present
time,'' MLS commissioner Doug Logan said of the Burn. ``I could go
on and on. But what has impressed me the most is the way \Rcoach\S
Dave \RDir\S has gotten that team playing together. They have a
look in their eye that they'll never lose a match again like they
lost to LA in the playoffs.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   As the second half of the Major League Soccer season begins, the
playoff picture comes into focus. The top four teams in the Eastern
and Western Conferences advance to the playoffs. A look at the
teams: Likely
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United: The perennial powerhouse of the MLS has lost its
past two games. But D.C.'s depth and leadership make it a favorite
to advance to the MLS championship game for the fourth consecutive
year. Chicago Fire: Last year's Cinderella team, the expansion Fire
made an unforgettable MLS debut by winning the 1998 championship.
Chicago jumped ahead early with a three-game winning streak this
season, before faltering a little to fall to third in the Western
Conference. Burn: A much healthier lineup, promising newcomers and
stellar play from forward Jason Kreis have gone a long way toward
sparking renewed optimism. For the past three seasons, the Burn
hasn't been able to shake its middle-of-the-pack reputation. But
continued production from the talented mix of veterans and
newcomers could make this season the time to change that. LA
Galaxy: LA has turned a shaky start into an 8-6 record, which
includes a 2-1 victory against United. Things seem to have fallen
into place under coach Sigi Schmid, who replaced Octavio Zambrano
earlier in the season. The Galaxy's future looks brighter with
newly acquired international Carlos Hermosillo and attacking
midfielder Roy Meyers. Colorado Rapids: The Rapids, who advanced to
the MLS finals in 1997, appear to be on course for another strong
postseason. Colorado boasts a 5-0 record at Mile High Stadium, is
in first place of the tough Western Conference and has won nine of
its past 10 games. Columbus Crew: The Crew has given its fans
reason to celebrate with an 8-5 record for second in the Eastern
Conference. Columbus' talented Caribbean connection of players has
performed well this season and should help the Crew earn a playoff
berth, but securing the top seed ahead of D.C. isn't likely. New
England Revolution: The Revolution (7-7) is third in the East
Conference. But New England is only one point out of second, and if
forward Joe-Max Moore keeps up his scoring tear, the Revolution
could challenge Columbus. In the hunt Tampa Bay Mutiny: The Mutiny
stumbled out of the blocks, going 0-4 before a five-game winning
streak. But Tampa Bay has slipped again, going 1-3 in its past four
games. The return of playmaker Carlos Valderrama, moved from Miami,
has helped. Kansas City Wizards: Under new coach Bob Gansler, the
Wizards have made a little more magic than they did at the
beginning of the season. Kansas City has started to fix its early
scoring problems, routing New York/New Jersey, 6-0, in its previous
match after scoring just nine goals in 12 games before that. But
the Wizards will have to rely on a mostly unheralded roster to come
up big if they hope to be in the hunt for the postseason. Unlikely
Miami Fusion: The Fusion has been unable to break out of the
Eastern Conference cellar. Coach Ivo Wortmann points to a young
squad as hope for the future. Forward Eric Wynalda was recently
moved to the Fusion, but unless he makes a speedy recovery from
knee surgery, Miami doesn't have much hope for a significant
turnaround. San Jose Clash: The Clash posts the most deceptive
record in MLS, with seven of its eight victories coming in the
shootout. Consequently, San Jose has just 10 points, one ahead of
last-place Kansas City. Raul Diaz Arce needs to break out of his
slump, and the Clash needs to learn how to win in regulation. New
York/New Jersey MetroStars: The MetroStars have lost nine of their
past 10 and five in a row, the most recent an almost comical 6-0
loss to struggling Kansas City. A postseason berth seems highly
unlikely, and at this point, even breaking .500 would be an
accomplishment.

3 SMALL COMPANIES WITH 3 ROUTES TO GETTING BIGGER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif., Canada)   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Business students, pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   There are few days when an entire new industry segment comes
into focus all at once, especially in the fast-growing business of
communications technology. Friday, however, was one of those days,
and it was full of lessons about how small companies try to become
big and the tough choices they make on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The day's cast was a trio of companies that are leading
developers of the next generation of Internet switches _ products
that can route billions, even trillions of bits of digital
information a second. They are Avici Systems Inc., based in North
Billerica, Mass.; Juniper Networks Inc., based in Mountain View,
Calif., and Nexabit Networks Inc., based in Marlborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, all three were independent private companies.
</P>
<P>
   But before financial markets opened, Nexabit announced that it
would be acquired by Lucent Technologies Inc., the communications
equipment giant, for $900 million in stock. Then, a few hours
later, Juniper's initial public stock offering hit the market,
giving the company a market value of almost $5 billion. Around the
same time, Avici's chief executive said he had broken off his
company's marketing partnership with the Nortel Networks Corp. of
Canada, one of Lucent's main rivals, with an eye toward a future
initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Executives for the three companies do not hesitate to point out
the technical differences among their products. But they are in
basically the same market. So why does one company choose to sell
itself to an industry giant while another opts for an IPO?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that Avici, Juniper and Nexabit have each made
classic risk-reward choices given their different stages of
development and their different visions of the sales and
distribution landscapes in the communications business.
</P>
<P>
   By offering shares to the public, Juniper has taken the biggest
risk of the three. While the appetite for communications stocks may
have never been stronger, that could always change. Friday, of
course, Juniper's stock performed brilliantly. After an initial
offering at $34, the company's shares closed at $98.875 Friday, up
$64.875, in Nasdaq trading, giving the company a market value of
$4.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder at least some Lucent executives Friday thought they
had found a $900 million bargain in Nexabit, though the price was
within the company's original range of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not as if Nexabit's executives should be kicking
themselves. Juniper was able to go public because it has real
customers who are paying for its products. While Nexabit's
technology is considered in some ways superior to Juniper's,
Nexabit is not yet selling products to paying customers, making it
tough to convince investors to buy the stock.
</P>
<P>
   For Lucent, however, Nexabit's immaturity could even be
considered an asset. Lucent can now direct the final development of
Nexabit's technology to fit its own needs, rather than having to
wedge a fully-developed product into its portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really think you can make it in the public markets,
you'll get a higher valuation in the public markets,'' said Sender
Cohen, an analyst for Lehman Brothers. ``But I can understand
Nexabit's choice. If you get offered $900 million and you can't go
public for another year, the question is whether the market is
going to be there. In that case I would sell out also.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Friday's news reflected drastically different
conceptions about how telecommunications equipment is sold and
distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Nexabit played it safe in this way as well. As part of Lucent,
Nexabit gains access to a large and experienced sales force that
enjoys strong relationships with a customer base that includes the
nation's biggest communications carriers. When Alcatel of France,
one of the world's biggest makers of communications gear, agreed
last year to acquire the DSC Communications Corp., an old-line U.S.
equipment maker, for $4.4 billion, it was largely because Alcatel
wanted DSC's sales channels into big U.S. carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have gone IPO and perhaps done better financially,
but as a smaller company we would have ended up with a smaller part
of the market,'' Mukesh Chatter, Nexabit's chief executive, said
Friday. ``We needed someone's channels, support and service
systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Avici and Juniper have decided they do not need that kind of
help.
</P>
<P>
   Avici made that choice in particularly stark fashion Friday as
it ended its sales partnership with Nortel, which still owns 20
percent of Avici (though it will cede its seat on Avici's board).
</P>
<P>
   Surya Panditi, Avici's chief executive, said Friday that he
wanted to follow Juniper into the stock market and that some
distance from Nortel would help in that effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that small companies no longer need the relationships
with the bigger companies to be successful with customers,'' he
said, ``and in the public market we also thought it would be more
helpful to be more independent.''
</P>
<P>
   But once again, Avici had the luxury to make that choice because
it is farther along than Nexabit in deploying its products.
Investment bankers are already pawing over Avici, hoping to take
the company public. Avici, for all of Panditi's talk, could still
decide to sell itself before an initial public offering. (Avici's
split from Nortel also probably had a lot to do with Nortel's
acquisition of Bay Networks Inc. last year. At some level Bay and
Avici could be seen as competitors.)
</P>
<P>
   But in trying to understand why different small companies follow
different paths to size, perhaps the most interesting thought came
from Daniel Smith, chief executive of Sycamore Networks Inc., a
private company in Chelmsford, Mass., that is developing an
advanced communications switch based on optical, rather than
electrical, technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look to the personal side as well,'' he said,
speaking generally. ``If you've never made any money and you've put
some energy into something and put some time into it and someone
comes along and says, `I'll give you this value' and you have an
opportunity to monetize, then it's hard as an individual if you've
never made money to let your bet ride.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ray Stata, Nexabit's chairman, made money as one of the
founders of Analog Devices in 1965, until Friday Chatter, who is
considered the father of Nexabit's technology, had not yet
participated in the spectacular wealth-creation of the 1990s. By
contrast, Scott Kriens, Juniper's chairman and chief executive, was
a founder of Stratacom Inc. before that company was acquired by
Cisco Systems Inc. in 1996 for about $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Smith should know what he is talking about. He and Desh
Deshpande, Sycamore's chairman, were the top two executives at the
Cascade Communications Corporation before that company was acquired
by Ascend Communications Inc. in 1997 for $3.7 billion. Smith says
Sycamore is in no rush to go public.

<P>
   RODEO, Durango, Mexico _ The common-law wife of suspected serial
killer Rafael Resendez-Ramirez said Friday the man she has lived
with since 1995 is not a rapist or a killer _ she says a wife would
know.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say his motive was rape and all that. But I, as his
sexual companion, would know to what degree those tendencies he
might have had. But he was absolutely normal,'' said Julieta
Dominguez Reyes, who added Resendez-Ramirez has been a ``model''
husband and father.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez, 42 and a laboratory technician at the state health
department clinic in this remote Mexican town, talked about her
husband as she cared for the couple's 3-month-old daughter, Lirio
Judith,
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez said she is cooperating with authorities and opened
her home in recent days to U.S. law enforcement authorities,
turning over some of her husband's letters, underwear and a guitar
he brought back from one of his many trips to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez, who is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List, is a
suspect in at least eight slayings in Illinois, Kentucky and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Dominguez said if authorities can prove her husband's guilt,
he should be prepared to pay for his crimes with his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, if he did something, he should pay,'' Dominguez said
Friday afternoon in the simple white, stucco home she shares with
Resendez-Ramirez. Her husband's pet dogs, a white German shepherd
and a black mutt, lolled on the front porch.
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``If he was involved in this, if he touched death,
then death should touch him, right? It is cause and effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez said Resendez-Ramirez was last home June 10. She said
her husband received a call that authorities were looking for him
in the central Mexican city of Puebla _ where he was born _ and he
quickly packed a few things and was gone in 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's the one, because he would have to be
extremely cold and calculating... and he would have raised some of
the details in front of me, but there was absolutely nothing,''
Dominguez said. ``He was a person who was absolutely exemplary in
his treatment of me and his daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband told her U.S. authorities were after him because of
his past activities with a group of anti-abortion activists.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez said her husband claimed he was prosecuted in the
United States in 1988 _ an investigation that cost $4 million _ and
the government was still after him.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez said her husband, who often sent home his earnings,
worked at ``honorable jobs'' in the United States, mostly as a
seasonal agricultural worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``His income was not fixed,'' she said. ``He worked at temporary
jobs, picking oranges in Florida, tobacco in Kentucky, asparagus in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   And he also smuggled local people across the border, Dominguez
acknowledged, but she said he charged only $400 apiece instead of
the going rate of $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he took people, one or two people he would take to cross
illegally and that's when he would get a little bit of money
because he didn't charge what they usually do.''
</P>
<P>
   Local police in Rodeo, a small town of 3,569 residents that
straddles the main highway heading north to Juarez and the border,
say Resendez-Ramirez often appeared in town with late model cars,
which he either gave to relatives or sold.
</P>
<P>
   Rodolfo Ramirez Ceniceros, commander of the Durango state
judicial police in Rodeo, stressed that Resendez-Ramirez had never
been involved in any crime in the small town or was even the
subject of a complaint. Local officers said Resendez-Ramirez was
apparently a member of an evangelical Christian group and did not
smoke, drink, attend dances or go out to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an introverted person, he was always alone,'' Ceniceros
said. ``He would ride his bike with his dogs, wearing shorts and a
T-shirt. He didn't have any friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Resendez-Ramirez's mother, Virginia, and step-father
_ a Mexican Army retiree named Luis Maturino Morales _ moved to
Rodeo and built a small house eight years ago and Resendez-Ramirez
moved there about five years ago. Dominguez said her husband told
her he was the illegitimate son of a musician who refused to
acknowledge him.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Resendez-Ramirez for a short time taught English as
a bilingual instructor at a private school on the town square that
offered technical courses and is run by an order of nuns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very serious. He didn't talk to anyone except his
dogs,'' a police officer recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Said another, ``He didn't have any friends. He didn't talk to
anyone or go into bars; he wasn't friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez said she met Resendez-Ramirez in Rodeo in 1994 when
she heard he had a car for sale. She bought another car, however,
after he could not provide proper Mexican registration papers for
the vehicle he was trying to sell. Resendez-Ramirez volunteered to
teach her how to drive her stick shift car and the lessons lead to
romance.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, they were living as man and wife in the modest,
three-bedroom house she bought on Avenue of the Palms, Dominguez
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, Dominguez still held out hope that all the
accusations against her husband would prove to be a case of
mistaken identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence in him that these things they are checking
on _ that it's not true. Like I said before, if he had done
something over there (in the United States) he wouldn't be going
back over there every little while.''
</P>
<P>
   As she held her infant daughter, Dominguez expressed fear that
``unscrupulous persons,'' tempted by rewards totaling $125,000,
could harm her or her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I fear in this situation, that in some form they
will harm my daughter, use her as a hook'' to get to
Resendez-Ramirez, Dominguez said.

WINDY, THE STARS WON THE CUP, SO PLEASE GET OVER IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
Windy Ruff Head Coach Buffalo Sabres Losersville, N.Y.
Dear Windy:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just wanted to drop you a line to see how you're enjoying the
off-season so far. Has it snowed yet? Thanks for timing summer
during the week we were there. Just can't tell you how much we
enjoyed our stay. Hope you feel the same.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly been a tumultuous week since we last saw you
foaming all over yourself after the Stars' 2-1 Game 6
triple-overtime victory buried your Sabres once and for all in the
Stanley Cup Finals. Was that already a week ago tonight? Seems like
it happened just yesterday, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Yep, that's a night we can savor forever.
</P>
<P>
   It was really sweet the way you played to the crowd last week
when everyone got together there in Buffa-lose to honor the
second-place finishers in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``No goal!'' you shouted. ``No goal!''
</P>
<P>
   Nice try, Windy, but we've got the Cup and those aren't sour
grapes we're filling it with in these glory days of wine and roses.
Get over it.
</P>
<P>
   In case you hadn't noticed, you were scored on again Thursday
night at the NHL awards ceremony, and by none other than ``The
Great One'' himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it means anything, I thought it was a goal,'' five-time
Lady Byng winner Wayne Gretzky said at the end of his acceptance
speech.
</P>
<P>
   That hard, rubber cylinder clogging the back of your throat,
Windy? That's the puck ``The Great One'' just zipped into your
craw. Take a hint and shut your mouth before you choke.
</P>
<P>
   Show a little uncharacteristic class here, Windy. Your team was
outstanding and the series was something the NHL desperately
needed, a nightly jaw-to-jaw showdown, not another four-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``This series did a lot for hockey, but maybe not in the way the
league intended,'' your own general manager, Darcy Regier, told
Sports Illustrated when it was over. ``We've been doing everything
the past few years to get more offense. This wasn't an offensive
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you equate offense with excitement, you might not have
liked seeing the two teams with the lowest goals-against average
during the season go at it. But for the fans who've been around the
game, they understood this was about character. This was about the
soul of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   You must have been pleased when SI bailed on a Stanley Cup
Finals cover for this week's edition. I hate to bust your bubble
but the magazine's editors insist it had nothing to do with the
controversial game-winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the controversial call, that would have been more of
a reason to put them on the cover,'' SI senior publicist Joe Assad
said yesterday. ``The decision this week was more difficult than it
usually is, because of the volume of potential covers. We had the
Stars, the NBA, Payne Stewart winning the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the last couple of years the NBA has taken the
cover from the NHL. We didn't have the Wings on the cover last year
either. The NBA seems to be what our readers prefer and that seems
to be reflected in the TV ratings, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Throw in the fact that by the time this week's issue hit the
stands, the game was a week old and that the magazine's editors
didn't really think they had a great photo from the game for a
cover, either.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds reasonable, if a little contrived, just like the NHL's
explanation of why Brett Hull's goal counted. He had control, he
shot, he scored. End of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   You don't like it, Windy, let me refer you to the solution
proposed by your Stars' counterpart Ken Hitchcock, who always cuts
to the chase: ``Don't be afraid to score more than one goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the Stanley Cup? Guess you didn't get much of a look at it
last week, just a brief glimpse from a distance, so let me catch
you up.
</P>
<P>
   It's had a blast.
</P>
<P>
   There's already a dent in it _ nobody's sure how it happened,
dropped on the plane, or in the locker room or somewhere _ but once
Stars officials were able to peel Eddie Belfour off of it, it's
been making the rounds.
</P>
<P>
   It showed up at The Ballpark in Arlington the other night and
sat on the grass by the pitcher's mound while Craig Ludwig was
tossing the ceremonial first pitch. Later that same night, it was
spotted doing the two-step with several pretty young things at
Cowboy's in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was off to the awards ceremony in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Looks like it's going to have one heck of a year. We'll mention
that you asked about it.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously this has been hard on you. You need to stop watching
re-runs of Hull's shot. Get out of the house, take a walk, shovel
the snow off the driveway. Just don't forget your parka.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and Windy, one more thing.
</P>
<P>
   It's a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Even ``The Great One'' says so. nn

TAPIA OVERCAME MOTHER'S DEATH, DRUG WOES ON WAY TO TITLE FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOEL ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there has been one constant in Johnny Tapia's life, it's that
he has always been fighting. Unfortunately for him, not all of his
fights have come in the ring, as it will tonight against Paulie
Ayala.
</P>
<P>
   Tapia, a bantamweight, gets paid heavyweight bucks to fight as a
professional. But as a youth, Tapia's fights were more of a
reaction to a circumstance that landed knockout blows.
</P>
<P>
   After his mother was raped and stabbed to death when he was 8,
Tapia turned to the unforgiving streets of his hometown of
Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was pretty much a troublemaker when I was little,''
Tapia said. ``I got in a lot of street fights.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum, president of Top Rank Inc., and Tapia's promoter, said
Tapia had a reputation as a thug.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incidence of street fights for Johnny is legendary,'' Arum
said. ``He's utterly and completely fearless to the point of
idiocy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tapia, who never knew his father, was rescued by his
grandfather, Miguel, who introduced him to the boxing ring at the
age of 11. The grit and fire that made Tapia a force on the streets
manifested itself into remarkable boxing talent. Tapia won two
Golden Gloves national titles in high school, and compiled more
than 100 victories on the amateur level.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the fight against drug addiction that nearly floored
Tapia.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after a successful foray into the professional ranks of
boxing, including a U.S. Boxing Association super flyweight title,
Tapia tested positive for cocaine after a title defense in October
1990. Two failed drug tests later, Tapia was suspended from boxing
for 3 1/2 years, sending him into a tumultuous period. He was
convicted of aggravated assault against his wife, Teresa, and
suffered through two near-fatal overdoses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so thankful that I didn't die on the streets,'' Tapia
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fighter in Tapia that allowed him to stay troublefree
since getting back into the ring in 1994 and become the man people
close to him say he is now: a doting father and loving husband, as
well as an undefeated bantamweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   Tapia, 32, credits a strong network of family and friends,
headed by his wife, as the reason he escaped addiction and
probably, death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where I'd be today if it wasn't for Teresa,''
Tapia said. ``She and my family and friends are everything to me.
All of the credit goes to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Tapia and his wife became the legal guardians
of 6-year-old Salo Jonathan Chavez, Teresa's nephew. Tapia said he
doubled his efforts to become a better husband, and he's now a
Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RSalo\S is the love of my life,'' Tapia said. ``And Teresa
has been there for me through so many tough times. She may leave
me, but I won't let her go. If I lose her I'm nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Teresa, who also is Tapia's manager, blushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so proud at what he has become out of the ring,'' she
said. ``Johnny is still an exciting person. He has the biggest
heart out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The family life still hasn't diminished Tapia's taste for the
flamboyant. Tapia sports a huge, jewel-encrusted replica of the
crucifixion around his neck and a large religious tattoo on his
chest. Arum, who has seen his share of entertaining boxers, said
Tapia now funnels his anger inside the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a real showbiz flair,'' Arum said. ``To beat Johnny,
Paulie is going to have to fight the fight of his life.''

AYALA'S PLAN FOR TITLE BOUT INCLUDES DICTATING PACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The question facing Paulie Ayala in his bantamweight
title fight against reigning champion Johnny Tapia tonight is
simple, but one 48 boxers previously have been unable to answer.
</P>
<P>
   How do you beat the undefeated Tapia, the World Boxing
Association champion at 118 pounds, and a man whose harshest fights
historically have been waged against personal demons?
</P>
<P>
   During the past six weeks, Fort Worth's Ayala and his training
team of Henry Mendez and Paul Reyes have devised a strategy they
believe will ambush the mercurial three-time champion at the
Mandalay Bay Events Center. And it begins with due respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said that Johnny Tapia is possibly the best junior
bantamweight in the world. Maybe even legendary,'' said Ayala,
alluding to Tapia's 40-month reign at 115 pounds. ``But I see
myself as the best bantamweight. And he has never faced an opponent
like me. Never.''
</P>
<P>
   The undercard is scheduled to start at 8 p.m. with the
championship bout expected to begin around 10 p.m. Showtime Event
Television will be carry the fight on pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by a title-fight loss in Japan 10 months ago, Team Ayala
has resurfaced with a revised map for the scheduled 12-rounder.
Mendez and Reyes want their left-handed challenger to dictate the
pace while incorporating more body punches, head movement and
combinations than Ayala previously has displayed in 28 bouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see a new Paulie Ayala in this fight,'' Reyes
said. ``Paulie knows that if he wants to win this title, he's got
to go get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, 29, plans to be ``tactical'' in hopes of not only
displaying his ring generalship, but also as a way of frustrating
the champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a chess match,'' said Ayala, the No. 2-ranked WBA
contender who will earn a career-best $60,000. ``You want to
counteract something that they have and want to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he can get easily distracted, and I can get him off
his game plan by aggravating him. He's an emotional fighter. He
fights off the crowd. But if you frustrate him and aggravate him,
he's going to come after you and get off his game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Tapia, 32, seems flattered by the attention Ayala (27-1, 12 KOs)
has paid to his style and its perceived shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to fight Johnny, but beating him is a
different story,'' said Tapia, of Albuquerque, N.M. ``I'm ready to
cut, I'm ready to bleed, I'm ready to do whatever. I'm not
losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tapia, a 3 1/2-1 betting favorite after starting at 6-1, speaks
with the confidence of a fighter who has forged a 46-0-2 record
with 25 knockouts during a career that began with one of his two
draws 11 years ago. Tapia also speaks with the resolve of a man
who, after having been floored by an addiction to cocaine, has
regained his self-esteem and place in boxing history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the ring where I'm safe,'' said Tapia, who will be
making the first defense of the WBA belt he took from ``Nana'' Yaw
Konadu of Ghana via a 12-round decision on Dec. 5. ``It's out of
the ring I have problems. So, what can you do to me?''
</P>
<P>
   Tapia said he fully expects Ayala to be in his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so,'' said Tapia, who has been knocked down twice in
his career. ``He is very easy to hit. If he doesn't pressure me,
I'll pressure him. He doesn't have big power, but I've seen him
sting some guys. Don't make no difference. I'm too strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendez and Reyes contend that Ayala's left-handed style will
present Tapia with a fresh set of concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paulie's not an average left-hander,'' Mendez said. ``He's a
superb left-hander, the kind I know Johnny's never encountered. In
fact, he ain't never encountered a right-hander in our caliber. He
cannot knock us out.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Freddie Roach and Tapia, who will earn $250,000, both
brushed off the suggestion that Ayala's southpaw style is a huge
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been sparring left-handers. Johnny fights left-handers
very well,'' said Roach, who noted that Tapia went through seven
sparring partners during his seven-week camp. ``The thing is, this
guy \RAyala\S is game. He may be too game for his own good.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of heart and I respect that. But it takes more
than that to win the bantamweight championship of the world from
Johnny Tapia.''

PRESBYTERIANS DELAY DECISION ON ORDAINING GAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By TARA DOOLEY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Faced with a recommendation to move the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) toward ordaining gays and lesbians,
denomination leaders voted on Friday to spend two more years
mulling the issue.
</P>
<P>
   With support of 61 percent of the voting clergy and lay church
leaders, the church's 211th General Assembly instructed
denomination officials to provide materials so that local
congregations and regional associations can discuss whether gays
and lesbians should be ordained as ministers and lay leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The move came with a recommendation that ordination requirements
not be revisited until the General Assembly meets in 2001, and it
effectively upheld the denomination's prohibition against ordaining
gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is searching for a broader degree of understanding on
various sides of the issue,'' said Stephen A, Moss, pastor of
Thyatira Presbyterian Church in Salisbury, N.C., and presenter of
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, a committee approved a proposal that could
have led to the removal of the prohibition on gay and lesbian
ordination. That suggestion to the General Assembly _ had it worked
its way through a long church process _ could have left ordination
decisions up to local churches and regional organizations called
presbyteries.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was not voted on by the entire General Assembly,
which decided instead to consider the more conservative approach.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, 319-198, was among the most controversial of the
meeting, which began at the Fort Worth Convention Center a week ago
and will end on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly's action was appropriate in light of tensions among
those with strong feelings about the ordination issue, said the
Rev. William F. Galbraith, pastor of St. Stephen Presbyterian
Church in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are people who would have liked to have seen
some decisive vote taken,'' he said. ``This vote does seem to be in
the spirit of the desire ... that we spend more time reflecting,
praying and seeking clarity about what God would be leading us to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   In prayer, General Assembly moderator Freda A. Gardner called
the discussion and the vote ``a very significant moment in our
lives and the life of the church.''
</P>
<P>
   The discussion on the convention center floor ranged from
analytical to emotional, as youth and adult leaders told the
General Assembly how they interpreted the issue and how it would
affect their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Alexandra Lusak of the West Jersey Presbytery in New
Jersey spoke about exemplary members of her congregation who were
excluded from leadership roles because of the church's prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   In a tearful plea for a decisive stand for gay and lesbian
ordination, youth advisory delegate David White of the St.
Augustine Presbytery in Florida urged the assembly to remember that
the church teaches unconditional love.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to deal with it,'' he said. ``We can't discriminate,
no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Bryan Smith of the Detroit Presbytery, who said he
is still wrestling with the topic, urged the assembly to allow time
for discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping we can find a way to keep talking about this in a
way that those of us who have strong convictions can understand
those of us who are still waiting and praying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ordination of gays and lesbians is not a new issue for the
denomination. Since 1978, church policy has restricted them from
being ordained as elders, deacons and ministers. The prohibition
was officially written into the denomination's Book of Order in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Some meeting participants saw this year's discussion as a move
away from the strife the topic has inspired.
</P>
<P>
   Youth advisory delegates on the recommending committee
overwhelmingly supported ending the prohibition, said the Rev.
Kathy Runyeon, an adjunct faculty member of the San Francisco
Theological Seminary and the moderator of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope expressed was that the climate would change to a more
open reality,'' Runyeon said.

BLACK BOXES IN CARS OPEN UP SAFETY POSSIBILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. CRONKLETON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- You undoubtedly have heard about the ``black
box'' federal investigators retrieve from an airplane after an
accident to help understand what caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Soon similar devices could be widely used in automobiles and
other modes of transportation, giving crash investigators insight
into drivers' behavior before an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers view the black box as a way to improve
automobile safety. Other experts, while supporting the concept, say
it needs to be looked at more critically.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1970s, General Motors Corp. has installed a
sensing module along with its airbags that measured and recorded
airbag performance.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the 1999 model year, GM began installing a more
sophisticated device that captures five seconds of data before
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Now investigators can know when the driver applied the brakes in
the seconds leading up to the crash, as well as the vehicle's
speed, engine speed and gas-pedal position, and whether seat belts
were being used.
</P>
<P>
   The use of such devices is favored by doctors, engineers and
government officials. They say real-world crashes can provide
valuable information on how crashes affect the human body.
Ultimately the data could provide insights on how to build safer
cars and improve treatment of crash victims.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced of the recorders' benefits, James Hall, chairman of
the National Transportation Safety Board, last month called for the
devices on cars, trains, buses and ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for all modes of transportation to realize the
unlimited potential that recorder technology has to offer, both in
terms of economics and safety,'' he said at a board conference last
month.
</P>
<P>
   The board has placed the devices on its new ``most-wanted list''
of safety improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The use of black-box systems raises concerns, however. The
biggest one is whether such information could be used against
drivers in litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has that potential,'' said Bob Langdon, senior partner of
the Lexington, Mo., law firm of Langdon, Emison, Kuhlman &AMP; Evans.
</P>
<P>
   As with any new technology, the courts or Congress will have to
decide whether the data collected by the black boxes is admissible
as evidence, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a trial lawyer, Langdon said he had concerns about who would
be collecting the data, how it would be used, how accurate the
devices were and how the information would be interpreted,
especially if the data contradicted other physical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are issues that need to be discussed in the near
future,'' he said. ``It really needs to be looked at.''
</P>
<P>
   GM conceded that such information might eventually be used in
litigation, but the company said it also could be used against GM
to prove some type of defect with a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his concerns, Langdon is quick to point out that he
supports the use of such devices, because they will show how people
and vehicles react in accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as another tool to be used to save lives,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a black box for automobiles is not new. Technology
that allows for its implementation is new.
</P>
<P>
   An early version of the black box was part of GM's first
regular-production driver-passenger airbag systems the company
introduced as an option in selected 1974 production vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the modules have become more sophisticated and are
capable of gathering more data.
</P>
<P>
   GM has installed its latest module in hundreds of thousands of
GM cars from the 1999 model year. Those cars include the Buick
Century, Park Avenue and Regal; the Cadillac Eldorado, DeVille and
Seville; the Chevrolet Camaro and Corvette; and the Pontiac
Firebird.
</P>
<P>
   GM plans to put the module in almost all of its vehicles in a
few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will help us build an objective driver database,'' said
Terry Connolly, director of GM's North American Safety Center.
``Currently we don't know how drivers react seconds and
milliseconds before a crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly said this data would let auto manufacturers such as GM
design better vehicles to protect passengers by understanding how
drivers react to crashes.
</P>
<P>
   While some people have expressed concerns that the device is an
invasion of privacy, Connolly said those fears were unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very benign set of data that is being collected,''
Connolly said. ``There is more personal information available on
the Internet than what will be collected by these devices.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, GM has to gain permission from the vehicle's
owner before collecting the data after a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Other automobile manufacturers have installed black boxes, too.
Ford Motor Co. has installed data recorders in all of its 1999
models. Ford's recorders collect a limited amount of data, said
Jennifer Flake, a Ford safety spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the Motor Vehicle Safety Research Advisory
Council was looking into the use of recorders to determine what
data would be the most helpful for researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of these modules is important so that we can improve
our understanding of crashes and so that we have a better analysis
of how injuries are coming about,'' said Jeffrey Augenstein, a
professor of surgery and director of the William Lehman Injury
Research Center at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``With better understanding, we can better create
countermeasures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Augenstein, a trauma surgeon, said the future of the devices was
what interested him. He said the next step would be to have the
devices automatically notify emergency crews when a vehicle was
involved in a crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many parts of the country, crashes occur in isolated areas,
and nobody knows about it for some time,'' he said. ``With
information from a (positioning system), emergency crews could know
almost immediately where the car is and what occurred in the
crash.''
</P>
<P>
   GM offers such a system on some models under the name OnStar. It
notifies emergency crews when a car's airbag is deployed. Also, the
National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration is testing a
system in Buffalo, N.Y., that automatically notifies authorities of
a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually emergency crews, Augenstein said, would be able to
look at what occurred and know what type of injuries the victims
most likely would be suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very, very exciting time in automobile safety,''
Augenstein said. ``There is a lot of opportunity to improve the
crash experience. It would be nice to say we know how to prevent
all crashes, but there will always be crashes, that is why they
call them accidents.''

EASE SIMULATION OFFERS PARENTS CHANCE TO RECORD TEENS' DRIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. CRONKLETON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- While most crash-recording devices are used
to collect data to help explain why an accident happened, a New
Milford, Pa., company is trying to use the technology to help
prevent crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Ease Simulation earlier this year introduced AutoWatch, a
product that allows parents to spy on their teen-agers' driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statistically, teen-agers are the most dangerous drivers on
the road,'' said Richard Wilbur, controller at Ease Simulation.
``By providing AutoWatch, we thought we could help change their
driving habits before it is too late.''
</P>
<P>
   AutoWatch, which works with Windows-based personal computers,
monitors a vehicle's speed, engine speed, gas-pedal position and
engine load. It also keeps track of the date and time the vehicle
was used.
</P>
<P>
   The system works by having parents set the limits on their
computer, such as every time the vehicle exceeds 65 mph. The
AutoWatch device is then hooked up to the vehicle. Whenever the
limits are exceeded, the module reports a time and date stamp along
with the violations.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent tampering, the module records a date and time if the
device is disconnected. To download the information, parents remove
the device from the vehicle and hook it back up to their home
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur said the product also appealed to corporations wanting to
monitor the driving habits of employees.
</P>
<P>
   The company offers two versions that work on almost any vehicle
from 1980 and later. The units cost $295 to $325, depending on the
model.
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur said parents who use AutoWatch should let their children
know it is there. He said the device was designed as a deterrent to
driving irresponsibly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fact of life. If you know you are being monitored, you
are going to behave differently,'' Wilbur said. ``In the
teen-ager's world, if you know your parents will know how fast you
are going, you are not going to go 85 mph too often.''

FRED C. TRUMP, 93, MASTER BUILDER OF HOUSING FOR MIDDLE CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fred C. Trump, one of the last of New York City's
major postwar builders, died Friday at a hospital in Queens. He was
93 and lived in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Although Trump was stricken with Alzheimer's disease six years
ago, he still retained his title of chairman of the board of Trump
Management, a title he held since the company was formed in the
mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Trump helped to change the face of Brooklyn and Queens with
thousands of homes for the middle class in plain but sturdy brick
rental towers, clustered together in immaculately groomed parks.
Although overshadowed in the news for the last two decades by his
flamboyant son Donald, Trump, a self-made man, built more than
27,000 apartments and row houses in the neighborhoods of Coney
Island, Bensonhurst, Sheepshead Bay, Flatbush and Brighton Beach in
Brooklyn, and Flushing and Jamaica Estates in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   His estate has been estimated by the family at $250 million to
$300 million, but Trump did not believe in displays of wealth _
with one exception. For decades, he insisted on a Cadillac, always
navy blue, always gleaming, and always replaced every three years,
its ``FCT'' license plate announcing its owner wherever he went.
</P>
<P>
   He was a frugal man. According to his sons, he would routinely
drive his Cadillac to one of his many construction sites after the
day's work was over. Wearing a natty suit _ with his chiseled
features and wide grin, he resembled a silent-film star _ he would
walk through the studs and across the plywood floors, picking up
unused nails to hand back to his carpenters the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Christ (pronounced Krist) Trump was born in New York
City in 1905. When he was 13, his father died of pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, at 15, he started his own construction business
while continuing his high school education. He knew he was too
young to build entire houses, so he thought of building housing for
the new mode of transportation then sweeping the nation; after all,
those newfangled automobiles needed garages. Too young to sign
checks, he became partners with his mother, Elizabeth. They called
their company E. Trump &AMP; Son. His mother, who was a dynamo in her
own right, was the partner who signed the checks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, Trump married Mary McLeod, who had come to this country
when she was 19 from Stornoway, Scotland. They had five children.
In addition to his wife and his sons Robert and Donald, he is
survived by two daughters, Maryanne Trump Barry of New York City,
who is a federal judge, and Elizabeth Trump Grau of New York City.
Another son, Fred Trump Jr., died in 1981. Both his brother John
and his sister, Elizabeth Trump Walters, are dead.
</P>
<P>
   Trump liked to be surrounded by familiar things and familiar
people. He still employed Amy Luerssen, his secretary for 59 years.
And he and his wife of 61 years still lived in the red-brick
Colonial they built in 1951 on a half-acre lot in the leafy,
middle-class suburb of Jamaica Estates, in Queens.

 &HT;    Thrashers ready if Tampa tabs Stefan
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Patrik Stefan met with officials of the Tampa Bay
Lightning Friday morning and with Thrashers officials Friday night.
About noon today, he'll find out which team he'll be spending his
immediate future with.
</P>
<P>
   After picking up spare parts from other NHL teams in the
expansion draft, Thrashers general manager Don Waddell will begin
to build the team's foundation, with the second pick in today's
entry draft.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa general manager Rick Dudley would not disclose who his
team's first overall pick would be, but he appeared to be leaning
toward Stefan, the Czech native who played last season with the
IHL's Long Beach Ice Dogs. If Stefan goes first, Waddell was
leaning toward taking Czech forward Pavel Brendl second over Swede
Daniel Sedin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Tampa takes Stefan, the bottom line is we have four
options,'' Waddell said. ``We can take Daniel Sedin, we can take
Brendl, we can take Henrik Sedin, or we can make a trade.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if those choices were listed in order of probability,
Waddell said, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Waddell nor Dudley are concerned about Stefan's health,
despite the players' multiple concussions that limited him to 33
games this year. Stefan's agent, Rich Winter, has held off
disclosing recent medical reports on the player, but Waddell said,
``I'm sure Rich will let us see anything we need to see.'' But
Winter said that Waddell's ``confidence is not yet well placed.''
Winter was to meet Friday with a ``medical consultant'' before
speaking to Waddell.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell might not have a decision to make on Stefan, and Brendl
is not a bad runner-up choice. Brendl had 73 goals and 61 assists
in 68 games with Calgary of the Western Hockey League. Waddell
thinks that Brendl could step right in and play in the NHL next
season, although he's not considered as far along as Stefan, who
already has played in a pro league.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get either Czech, he can play next year,'' Waddell said.
</P>
<P>
   Brendl, who as recently as two weeks ago did not express much
confidence in playing in the NHL next season, appeared more
confident Friday. ``I believe I can make the next step. But I have
to work out hard during the summer, and then we'll see in training
camp what the team wants to do,'' Brendl said. ``I have always
scored a lot of goals, so I think I can score again.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel and Henrik Sedin, the Swedish twins, probably are two
years away from playing in the NHL. Both are represented by the
same agent, Michael Barnett, who was hoping to orchestrate a trade
so the brothers end up on the same team. The team most likely to
pull that off in the draft is Vancouver, which picks third.
</P>
<P>
   Stefan won't fall that far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to be number one,'' Stefan said. ``But I
don't know what is going to happen. It is a question I ask myself
all the time. But I don't ask the teams. I don't think that would
be so good.

 &HT;    Thrashers deal for defense
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ About one hour before he was to step onto a stage and
read a list of names that would form his franchise's nucleus, Don
Waddell decided several weeks of trade talks involving a blur of
names and draft picks would come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, eight trades with a ninth on deck is quite enough for
one day.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell selected a 26 NHL leftovers, then wheeled and dealed to
swap two players, add eight more, then acquired three more picks in
today's amateur draft to punctuate the Thrashers' expansion draft
Friday at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: Atlanta was left with pretty much what Waddell
had projected _ a roster that is fairly solid in goal (Damian
Rhodes and Norm Maracle), decent on defense and mobility but devoid
of any goal production.
</P>
<P>
   ``From where we started this process to where we are today, we
feel really good about this,'' Waddell said. ``We know we don't
have all the answers yet. We need to add some pieces to the puzzle.
But it's a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers confirmed eight trades five hours after the draft
ended. The biggest ones:
</P>
<P>
   _ Goalie Trevor Kidd, who had been selected as an expansion pick
from Carolina, was traded to Florida for veteran defenseman Gord
Murphy, minor-league forward Herbert Vasiljevs, defenseman Daniel
Tjarnqvist (an unsigned draft pick from Sweden) and a sixth-round
pick (of Ottawa's) today.
</P>
<P>
   _ Detroit shipped would-be unrestricted free agent Ulf
Samuelsson to the Thrashers, who agreed not to pick forward Igor
Larionov off the Red Wings' unprotected list (Waddell would've
dealt Larionov to Anaheim or Vancouver). The Thrashers instead
chose Maracle. They likely won't sign Samuelsson but will gain a
compensatory draft pick next year (second- or third-rounder) when
another team signs the defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a complex deal with Boston, the Thrashers agreed not to
select goalie Robbie Tallas, picked up right wing Peter Ferraro,
then traded him back to the Bruins for top prospect Randy
Robitaille, who had been on the Bruins' protected list. Robitaille
led Providence (AHL) in scoring with 24 goals and 78 assists for102
points.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fourth- and sixth-round draft picks were acquired from
Vancouver to not draft goalie Garth Snow, who was unlikely to be
taken anyway. Instead, the Thrashers chose forward Steve Staios.
</P>
<P>
   Pending future deals, the Thrashers' weak offensive attack _
based on this year's regular season statistics _ is centered by St.
Louis' Terry Yake (nine goals), Phoenix's Mike Stapleton (nine) and
Florida's Johan Garpenlov (eight). Waddell chose not to take Los
Angeles's Vladimir Tsyplakov (11 goals), who would have become an
unrestricted free agent next year, or two high-priced talents he
had considered _ Tampa Bay's Alexandre Daigle and Vancouver's Trent
Klatt. He said neither was worth their near seven-digit salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought a fresh start with a new franchise might be good
for Alexandre, but we just decided to go in another direction,''
said Waddell, who used his Tampa pick on goalie Corey Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell used the Kings' pick on tough left winger Matt Johnson,
who accumulated 131 penalty minutes last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers selected three goalies (trading Kidd), the maximum
10 defensemen and 13 forwards in the draft. One defenseman,
Anaheim's Jamie Pushor, is expected to be dealt to Phoenix for a
second-round draft pick next season.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta also gained minor-league goalie Scott Langkow from
Phoenix in exchange for picking a player (Stapleton) off the
Coyotes' short list of three players. New Jersey, which didn't want
to lose a forward, agreed to send the Thrashers defenseman Sergei
Vshedkevich if Atlanta didn't select a forward (the Thrashers took
defenseman Kevin Dean). A similar deal with Buffalo (concerned
about losing winger Geoff Sanderson) netted Atlanta minor-league
defenseman Dean Sylvester in addition to defenseman Darryl Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers also reached agreement with Calgary a few weeks
ago to not draft defenseman Phil Housley if he was left
unprotected. As it turned out, Housley was protected, but the
Thrashers gained unsigned Swedish draft pick Andreas Karlsson, in
addition to their pick of forward Ed Ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got all the bangers and checkers we need, now we just
need some goal scorers,'' Waddell said. ``But if you look at our
board, all of the guys we took can skate. That's the key ingredient
as we build a team. We want to make sure we've got guys who can get
there.''

   Instead of converting its software to read each year as four
digits -- say 1999 or 2003 -- Microsoft Office 2000 continues to
use a two-digit date field to identify the year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The software uses a common ``windowing'' technique to tell the
computer which century the years refer to. For instance, software
can be programmed to see any year ending in 50 and above as year
19xx, and any year beginning with 49 or below as year 20xx. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, Feilder said, Office 2000, combined with Microsoft
Windows 98, allows users to set their own date fields. For
instance, a user can decide that any year ending in 25 or above
should start with a 19. And it allows users to set different
parameters for different types of software included in the Office
2000 suite. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Office 2000 now allows users to set up to 99 date windows of
their own choosing,'' Feilder said. ``Two different users type the
same two-digit date into the same spreadsheet and it means two
different dates because each user has set their own date window.
This is particularly dangerous in a networked environment where
users share access to common databases.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Feilder describes Microsoft's Y2K efforts as checkered. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently, great strides have been made by their year 2000
group, but I fear Office 2000 has undone all that work. For over
three years I've been trying to help them understand the need to
remove all two-digit year possibilities from their products. Now
they're going in the opposite direction.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says the technique used in Office 2000, known as
sliding windowing, gives customers maximum flexibility. &QL; 
 &QL; 
What, me worry? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After organizing a Y2K summit for 150 elected officials this
week, Kansas City, Mo., Councilwoman Teresa Loar said she is not
overreacting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we are going to have any major disasters in
Kansas City'' on Jan. 1, said Loar, co-chairwoman of the
Mid-America Regional Council's Y2K Elected Officials Task Force.
``There may be some glitches at the ATMs and traffic lights, but
other than that, I don't see any problems.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she is so confident in the region's Y2K response that
her family isn't planning to make any just-in-case preparations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Utilities, public safety, banking and water department leaders
-- everybody assures me that their systems will be up and
running,'' Loar said. ``I seldom plan an hour ahead anyway. Y2K
won't be any different for us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Co-chairwoman Joan Bowman, mayor of Lenexa, Kan., said she is
following the advice of the American Red Cross and planning for
Jan. 1 as if it were a bad winter storm: some bottled water, some
food and plenty of firewood and candles. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rehearsals for madness &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Calls streamed in every 45 seconds for nearly 2 1/2 hours to a
unified command center in Lawrence, Kan., this week as part of a
``Millennium Madness'' Y2K preparedness drill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ring: Six dead in suicide pact at Stull Cemetery. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ring: Power outages in Lecompton and Lawrence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ring: $3,000 price tags on used generators. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ring: Rioting, looting, missing children and litter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was all designed to test the mettle of the 52 emergency
responders in Douglas County who participated in the drill designed
by emergency management director Paula Phillips. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And after a frenetic morning of staged Y2K woe, Phillips said
her notebook was crammed with useful tidbits to prepare for
anything that a computer crash, or general mayhem, may throw at
emergency responders. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Public works officials learned they need more staff on duty to
help barricade streets or service emergency vehicles. Emergency 911
dispatchers say they need a cadre of couriers to expedite response
actions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And when the drill called emergency workers to deal with hungry
passengers on a stalled Amtrak car in east Lawrence, Phillips
learned the importance of the American Red Cross bearing food. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time it was over, people were tired and exhausted,''
she said. ``But it was definitely worth it.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tidbits &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- In Las Vegas, Y2K has delayed the January 2000 retrial of a
man implicated in the alleged murder-for-hire slaying of a woman
with ties to the wealthy DuPont family. During the first couple of
days of 2000, only the most necessary court hearings will be
conducted, said Clark County court administrator Chuck Short. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Bad computer programming 14 years ago caused a June 16 sewage
spill in Los Angeles that dumped 3 million gallons of raw sewage
into a city park, officials now say. The spill occurred when the
plant was testing a Y2K scenario in which the power failed. The
emergency generator kicked in as expected, but a gate failed to
reopen when a computer malfunctioned. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- The high-tech industry, which also is asking for protection
from lawsuits filed by consumers and companies harmed by Y2K-caused
computer malfunctions, is banding together to make sure its own
suppliers are ready for Jan. 1, 2000. A group of 27 companies
joined together this week to form the High Tech Consortium -- Year
2000 &AMP; Beyond. The consortium will allow the companies to share
information about the Y2K readiness of suppliers that supply
crucial components for computers and other equipment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- In Venezuela, officials have hired psychologists to find a
way to inform -- but not panic -- citizens about Y2K. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- In Norway, prisoners at minimum-security prisons may be
released during the date rollover to avoid potential problems if
security measures fail. &QL;

BORDER AGENTS FREED SUSPECTED SERIAL KILLER JUNE 2, FBI SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Graphic available on NYT database) 
(Eds.: Also see: Serial-killer-home) 
 
By JERRY URBAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Suspected serial killer Rafael Resendez-Ramirez was
taken into custody by immigration authorities earlier this month
but was returned to Mexico soon afterward, federal officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Linked through physical evidence to eight deaths in Illinois,
Kentucky and Texas, Resendez-Ramirez was detained by U.S. Border
Patrol agents June 1 after he crossed into the United States
illegally about seven miles east of Santa Teresa, N.M. He was
released into Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, in the early morning hours of
June 2.
</P>
<P>
   Because Resendez-Ramirez, believed to be 38, was using an alias,
agents were not aware that he was the man wanted at that time in
connection with three slayings in Texas and one in Kentucky, said
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service spokeswoman Mariela
Melero in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no indication at the time that he was a fugitive from
justice,'' said Melero.
</P>
<P>
   His fingerprints were taken and entered into the INS fingerprint
identification system, which is primarily a database of information
about people apprehended for crossing the border illegally, Melero
said.
</P>
<P>
   Agents had no reason, she said, to make a separate and specific
inquiry to such databases as the National Crime Information Center,
which could have identified him as the wanted man.
</P>
<P>
   Melero said Resendez-Ramirez, who is known to have used at least
30 aliases, was treated like the other 1.5 million illegal
immigrants detained each year along the U.S-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of four of the eight people alleged to have been
killed by Resendez-Ramirez were found after June 2: Josephine
Konvicka, 73, of Fayette County, Texas, on June 4; Noemi Dominguez,
26, of Houston, on June 5; and George Morber, 80, and his daughter,
Carolyn Frederick, 52, in Gorham, Il., on June 15.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a suspect in the murders of Christopher Maier, 21, in
Lexington, Ky., on Aug. 29, 1997; Dr. Claudia Benton, 39, of West
University Place, an enclave of Houston, on Dec. 17, 1998; and The
Rev. Norman ``Skip'' Sirnic, 46, and his wife, Karen, 47, in
Weimar, Texas, on Apirl 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe he rides freight trains around the country
because all the crimes in which he is a suspect occurred near
railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Zuniga, another INS spokesman, said Resendez-Ramirez was
processed at the Santa Teresa Border Patrol station, where his
photo and fingerprints were taken.
</P>
<P>
   In the early morning hours of June 2, he was taken in a
government van halfway across an international bridge and released
into Ciudad Juarez, across from El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he even broke a sweat while he was in
custody,'' Zuniga said.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez was first detained for slipping into the United
States illegally in 1976, and has served state prison time in New
Mexico and Florida. He had been deported at least four times.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Friday in Houston, the FBI displayed the
photograph taken June 2 of Resendez-Ramirez, along with several
other photos of him that law enforcement has gathered.
</P>
<P>
   Special agent in charge Don K. Clark did not blame anyone for
the release of Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to discuss whether it was a mechanical error or
an error at all,'' he said.``Clearly we would have liked to have
had him some time ago. But what it does do is give us the most
current photograph that we can get out to the public in the hope
that somebody may have seen this person.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, the FBI formed a multiagency task force, ``Operation
Train Stop,'' based in Houston, and the nationwide publicity about
Resendez-Ramirez began shortly after that.
</P>
<P>
   The reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction
of Resendez-Ramirez, who was put on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list
Monday, has grown to $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with information about his whereabouts should contact the
FBI command center at 1-800-889-8161.

KEATING, ROMER HAVE DIFFERENT ANSWERS ON STOPPING VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Neighbors knew each other, guns were used for sport,
and teenagers' rivalries were settled with shoving and occasional
fists in days when Frank Keating was growing up in Oklahoma and Roy
Romer was a boy in small-town Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a child, I hunted with shotguns and rifles after
school, but I never hunted my classmates,'' said Keating, the
two-term Republican governor of Oklahoma who dealt with the 1995
bombing that killed 168 people at the federal building in Oklahoma
City.
</P>
<P>
   Romer, a Democrat who retired in January after three terms as
governor of Colorado, went to the funerals after this year's
Columbine High School shooting and talked extensively with young
people, teachers and parents about what might have caused two
seniors to go on a shooting rampage, leaving 15 people dead,
including themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always thought they would be safe in the suburbs,''
Romer said. ``The violence elsewhere couldn't happen to you.
Littleton was a `safe' suburb.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer was in Seattle for a meeting of state Democratic chairs.
Keating is speaking Saturday to a session of Team 100, an
organization of the Republican Party's biggest donors.
</P>
<P>
   Out of tragedy, the two prominent politicians have come to very
different conclusions about what needs to be done about violence,
and school violence, in America.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the two weapons used in the Littleton massacre in
April came from gun shows, Romer has become an outspoken crusader
for such safety measures as a 72-hour period to check the
backgrounds of persons buying firearms at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a sea change public attitude'' in favor of gun
safety laws, Romer said. ``It was the knowledge of parents that
they cannot protect their own children that caused it.''
</P>
<P>
   A former FBI agent, Keating has taken the opposite stand. He
cited similarities of the Oklahoma City bombing and the Columbine
High School shootings in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perpetrators in both crimes could have done what they did
no matter how strict the laws on the books,'' he said. The crimes
were caused not by weak laws but by ``a huge vacancy in their
souls.''
</P>
<P>
   Keating acknowledged that passing laws making it more difficult
for children to obtain weapons ``will have an impact.'' But he
denounced those who have used the Colorado shooting to call for
tighter firearms laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking an extreme and irresponsible view that the gun did it
rather than the kids shows that people are proposing political
solutions and hunting for political gain,'' Keating said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the federal government should step up prosecutions of
convicted felons caught with guns.
</P>
<P>
   But, he cautioned, ``I think anything that discourages the
rights of citizens to protect themselves would be calamitous to the
good order of our country. We would have only the criminals
armed.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer acknowledged the National Rifle Association's success in
lobbying the U.S. House of Representatives to reject the 72-hour
waiting period.
</P>
<P>
   He argued, however, that the NRA's victory may be brief. Romer
took on the gun rights group when he persuaded the Colorado
Legislature to pass a law banning ownership of handguns by anyone
under 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elected officials see the NRA's ability to come in and
organize, and they read it wrong,'' said. ``The issue has moved out
of the isolated world of the special interest group into public
discussion. People are saying, `Hey, we've had enough of these
shootings.' In that realm, the NRA can only lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer and Keating also had predictably different views of a
possible presidential showdown between Vice President Al Gore and
Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Romer said Republicans are ``annointing'' Bush as their
candidate, despite his apparent lack of in-depth knowledge of many
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush would not be a candidate for president if he
did not have his father's name,'' Romer said. Noting the vice
president's role in ending the air war over Yugoslavia, he added:
``I take comfort that it was Al Gore on the phone with the
Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   Keating, however, depicted Bush as a skilled negotiator who has
pushed tax cuts and tort reform through a Democrat-dominated
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes from remarkable stock,'' Keating said of Bush. ``His
father is a saint. ... His mother and father inculcated values in
him. ... ''

CHINA FACES LONG ROAD TO FINALS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: China, Australia, Ghana, Sweden, Norway, Russia, Canada,
Japan ,  N.J., Ore., Calif., Mass.)   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No team from among the 16 in the Women's World Cup will cover
more miles during the tournament than China. So no one could blame
the Chinese for skipping a walk-through Friday at Giants Stadium
designed to acclimate them to the grass for Saturday's clash with
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese will meet Australia after Russia takes on Canada in
the opening game in East Rutherford, N.J., where a crowd in excess
of 40,000 is expected. The Chinese went directly to their hotel to
rest after practice at nearby Montclair State University.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese traveled for almost 13 hours on Thursday following
the team's 7-0 triumph over Ghana in Portland, Ore., on Wednesday
night, a victory that assured China a place in the quarterfinals.
The Chinese coach, Ma Yuanan, through a team spokesman, simply
called the scheduling of the games for his team unfair.
</P>
<P>
   China opened the tournament with a victory over Sweden in San
Jose, Calif., then moved on to Portland before traveling to New
Jersey. They will have to return to San Jose for Wednesday's
quarterfinals. Then, if they reach the semifinals, as expected, the
Chinese will have to come east again to Boston, for a game next
Sunday. A victory there would send them west again, to Los Angeles,
for the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the U.S. team, projected to be China's opponent in
the final, can reach the championship game by going from New Jersey
to Chicago to Boston to Washington to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The weary Chinese might use second-stringers Saturday against
Australia, which needs to beat China and have Ghana beat Sweden in
order to advance.
</P>
<P>
   Russia can advance with a victory over Canada, which can advance
only by beating Russia by three goals and having Japan upset
Norway. This will be Russia's third game in seven days and Canada's
third in eight days.

RIVALS JOIN FORCES, FOR NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ And now for something totally different in the bid
to return an NFL franchise here _ Team Los Angeles?
</P>
<P>
   In the latest twist to the process of trying to gain a Los
Angeles expansion franchise, the two groups competing for the team
have apparently agreed to cease fire and present a unified
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   For now at least, Eli Broad and Ed Roski Jr. are rivals no more
with Michael Ovitz and Ron Burkle. Anyway, that's what Broad said.
</P>
<P>
   Broad said both groups met with NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue
and Gov. Gray Davis' new point man, Bill Chadwick, on Wednesday and
agreed to work together on Coliseum redesign, a site plan and
financing, and present it as a single package to owners at their
July 28 meeting in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get the best out of everyone,'' Broad said.
``The main thing is, we're working together and not separate and
competing with one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got it down. We're all working toward the Los Angeles
Coliseum. The competition isn't the other guy now, it's Houston.
And that puts us in a much stronger position than before.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad and Ovitz haven't historically agreed on much, and if that
was the Ovitz interpretation of the meeting, he was keeping it
typically private.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regard the involvement of the state as very productive and
the meeting as very useful,'' Ovitz said through a representative.
Beyond that, he referred all questions to Chadwick. Chadwick could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   This new team effort not only includes Broad, Ovitz and suddenly
the governor, but the NFL. Roger Goodell, an NFL vice president who
was also at this week's meeting, could become a regular participant
in future meetings to build a Los Angeles consensus.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL previously granted Los Angeles a conditional franchise,
giving it a Sept. 15 deadline to finalize a winning proposal or
lose the expansion team to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   When the two competing groups presented separate plans for the
Coliseum to owners last month in Atlanta, Los Angeles seemed no
closer to getting final approval than before.
</P>
<P>
   Now Davis has charged Chadwick, an attorney and investment
banker, with coordinating the Los Angeles bid and giving direction
from the state _ which owns the Coliseum and Exposition Park.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has said he won't support state funding to lure the NFL
back, but Chadwick is now exploring ways to justify building the
expensive parking additions by offsetting their costs with
additional revenue and public use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parking is needed for the 40 or 50 days the stadium is going
to be used for, but it may also be used as a park-and-ride facility
for downtown,'' Broad said. ``We talked about how it could be used
for USC, which has a big appetite for additional parking. This had
not been discussed before. It's a much broader agenda and
discussion than we've had. It isn't just parking for 10 NFL games
any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad said there will be a compromise between the 7,000-space
garage he had promoted and the 27,000 spaces proposed by Ovitz. The
NFL has pushed for at least 25,000 parking spaces on-site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have agreed to a concept that in this city, it's very
important that people park not too far away and feel safe,'' Broad
said. ``Most of it will end up being on the property, with some at
USC. It's going to be a reasonable compromise number.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad said they are also examining using USC's football field as
a practice facility for the NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   This could all prove an uneasy alliance between the two
competing groups. Even if they manage to work as one leading up to
the July 28 meeting, that doesn't necessarily mean they will
ultimately present themselves as one ownership group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ownership issue is not going to be decided until the
end,'' Broad said. ``We have more or less agreed to work together.
And at the end we either join forces as owners or we don't. If we
don't, the NFL will pick which ownership they prefer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it gets down to it, sure, we'll be competing for who gets
the most votes. But the first thing we have to do is tee this thing
up so we get an NFL expansion team to the Coliseum.''

JUDGE UPHOLDS AND EXTENDS REPEAL OF COMMUTER TAX  (jw) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A state Supreme Court judge Friday upheld and even
extended the state Legislature's repeal of New York City's tax on
commuters who live in the state and ruled that the city could no
longer collect the tax from residents of New York, Connecticut, New
Jersey or any other state.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, by Justice Barry Cozier of the state Supreme Court
in Manhattan, dealt a blow to the city's $35 billion budget, which
stands to lose $360 million a year in commuter tax revenue. New
York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Peter Vallone, the City Council
speaker, who sued the state last month in an attempt to overturn
the repeal, immediately said that they would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that Judge Cozier was incorrect, that really the
opinion is inconsistent in a number of ways,'' Michael Hess, the
city's corporation counsel, said Friday. ``We are going to appeal
right away.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to prompting the suit filed by New York City, the
repeal was challenged by officials and commuters in Connecticut and
New Jersey, but for quite a different reason. Those suits charged
that the because the Legislature's measure lifted the tax only for
New York State commuters, the repeal was discriminatory and
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The city, on the other hand, charged that the state could not
eliminate taxes that feed the city treasury without a request from
the mayor and the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   But Cozier ruled that the state needed no such request, because
the repeal did not affect the ``property, affairs and government''
of the city. He also ruled that the Legislature could decide on its
own to repeal the tax because the state had a ``substantial''
interest in regulating tax policy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Cozier agreed with the plaintiffs from Connecticut
and New Jersey, ruling that the Legislature's attempt to repeal the
tax only for New York state residents violated the equal protection
clause of the U.S. Constitution. He said the selective repeal also
violated the Constitution's commerce clause, because repealing a
tax as it applied to residents of one state but not to others could
disrupt interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge says that's not correct, which was very obvious,''
Hess said of the selective repeal. ``Now it snaps over to a
situation in which nobody has to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Cozier, who joined all the suits, ruled from the bench Friday
after hearing oral arguments. A written ruling is expected Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The commuter tax, in place for 33 years, is 0.45 percent of
earned income for most people. Nearly 800,000 people pay the tax,
which amounts to about $180 a year for someone who earns $40,000 in
net income.
</P>
<P>
   The repeal infuriated Giuliani and Vallone, who maintained that
commuters should help pay for city services. They also condemned it
as a blatant attempt by state legislators to curry favor with
suburban voters, and in fact momentum for the repeal first
developed when it became an issue in a special election for a state
Senate seat from Rockland and Orange counties. The two major
contenders proposed repealing the tax, and both Republican and
Democratic leaders responded in an effort to help their causes.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected loss of revenue led the mayor and the speaker to
abandon a number of tax-cut proposals for city residents. In the
end, they included only three relatively modest cuts, worth $348
million, in the $35.3 billion budget for the fiscal year that
starts July 1.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. George Pataki and numerous state legislators contended
that the repeal was a valid attempt to ease the tax burden on
commuters, particularly when the city has a record budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The city collects about $210 million a year from commuters who
live in New York State, and an additional $150 million from
commuters who live in other states, mostly New Jersey and
Connecticut. Officials in Albany said Friday that they had not
decided whether to fight the extension of the repeal to commuters
from other states.
</P>
<P>
   But officials in New Jersey and Connecticut appeared confident
that the ruling would stand.
</P>
<P>
   `Tax cuts have been at the core of our economic recovery, and
I'll fight to win them for New Jersey residents any way I can,''
Gov. Christie Whitman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general, said that
the ruling ``sends a message that tax wars will not be tolerated
among neighboring states.''

<P>
   WALLULA, Wash. _ Khamkong Baninthivong, a Laotian immigrant who
has quietly worked for 13 and a half years as a meat trimmer at the
IBP plant here in eastern Washington, voted to strike because she
feels her wage _ $8.28 an hour, 10 cents more than her hourly wage
at the plant seven years ago _ is simply too low.
</P>
<P>
   Josefina Alfaro, originally from El Salvador, a U.S. citizen as
of two years ago, voted to strike IBP, the world's largest producer
of beef and pork products, because she thinks the union will win.
``But even if not,'' said the 45-year-old Mrs. Alfaro, a meat
cutter walking the picket line, ``it's worth the risk because there
are other jobs out there. A lot of places _ hospitals, plants _
they're all looking for people.''
</P>
<P>
   And Almir Biscevic, 23, a Bosnian Muslim who fled his
war-wracked country with his family three years ago, voted for the
strike earlier this month even though he was not quite sure how it
all worked. ``When I first heard, I was, `Strike? What is a
strike?''' said Biscevic in the English he is struggling to master.
``But now I am for it. There's a lot wrong inside that plant.
There's not safety. There's not respect.''
</P>
<P>
   What began as a wildcat strike earlier this month at the plant,
where about 90 percent of the 1,500 workers are immigrants, has
quickly mushroomed into a test of wills between IBP and a feisty
union whose action is now sanctioned by the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the work stoppage, approved by a vote of 847-291
in early June, is a notable example of community organizing among
workers who cannot even communicate in a common tongue. Rallies
here have featured speeches in English and Spanish, with pauses for
the words to be translated into Lao, Vietnamese and Serbo-Croatian.
As Maria Martinez, a strike leader, put it: ``It's not so hard to
get people together, because `Enough is enough' is something you
can understand in any language.''
</P>
<P>
   But the successful start of the strike also highlights some
larger factors clearly at work here in Wallula, including the
receptivity that many immigrants feel toward union activity and
their growing confidence that, with a strong economy and many
employers anxious for workers, the potential benefits of pressing
for better wages and working conditions outweigh any risks.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it an isolated example. This week, for instance, workers
at the nation's largest textile complex, Fieldcrest Cannon in
Kannapolis, N.C., voted to unionize, according to unofficial
returns, a sweeping victory for organized labor after unsuccessful
efforts stretching across decades, and one that leaders there
attributed in part to the growing number of immigrant workers at
the plant.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this year, winning the biggest unionization drive in
half a century, the Service Employees International Union earned
the right to represent nearly 75,000 home-care workers in the Los
Angeles area. Many of those workers, who care for the elderly and
disabled, are immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the most significant victories labor has seen in the
past 10 years have been among immigrant workers,'' said Kate
Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research at Cornell
University, pointing to the recent votes as well as ones by
asbestos-removal workers and janitors in several big cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons is simply that immigrants still tend to
live in communities with others who work with them,'' she said.
``Most white workers today who aren't recent immigrants, they're
much more scattered in terms of where they live. In that sense,
they're much harder to organize.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the workers come from countries with some tradition of
union activity and may themselves have been leaders of such
efforts, said Fernando Gapasin, an expert on immigrant labor at the
University of California at Los Angeles. ``Some of these workers
are very heads-up about how to organize.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, some major unions, with leaders who came of age in
battles where there were no language barriers among workers, have
been slow to respond to the changing dynamics posed by the influx
of immigrant workers. Gapasin cited that as one major reason why
union membership overall has continued to decline in this country,
to under 14 percent of the workforce today from about 35 percent in
the mid-1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unions are certainly developing strategies to deal with
multicultural workforces, but many have been slow to do so,''
Gapasin said. ``It is a weakness for labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those problems are in evidence at the strike here in
Wallula, an agricultural town near the confluence of the Snake and
Columbia Rivers. The action clearly began among the rank-and-file,
and was endorsed only belatedly by Teamsters leaders higher up the
organizational chain, who waited for several days to sanction an
official strike vote.
</P>
<P>
   When a Teamsters official showed up on June 6, two days after
several hundred workers had staged a walkout at the plant, a crowd
of angry IBP employees unleashed a torrent of complaints about what
they felt was a lack of support from union leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The heckling grew so bad that at one point the official, Al
Hobart, secretary-treasurer of Local 760 of Yakima, responded in
kind. ``One of the major issues in your negotiations has been
respect,'' he told the workers, according to a report in The
Tri-City Herald, the newspaper here. ``You cannot get what you
don't give. You have shown me very little today.''
</P>
<P>
   Respect is what many workers here say they do want to gain from
their strike, and many pointed to what they said were abysmal
working conditions at the plant, a hulking concrete complex set
amid the farmlands, where hundreds of cattle are shipped in for
slaughter daily and the powerful smell of dead meat hangs in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   The plant, one of 48 around the country owned by IBP, turns out
meat products for human and pet consumption, and also by-products
of the slaughter that are used for soap and glue.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the workers on the picket line complained not only of
low pay, but also of unsanitary conditions and injuries they
suffered on line like cuts, and hand and joint pains stemming from
what they said was constant pressure to speed up production.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The chain, it turns very, very fast,'' said Kien Nguyen, a
55-year-old flank-steak trimmer, referring to the conveyor belt on
which pieces of meat come to his station. ``Too fast. The safety is
very low.'' Nguyen, originally from Vietnam, used to work as a
newspaper deliverer in Orange County, Calif., and came to Wallula
two years ago when a friend told him about jobs available at the
plant here. He makes $8.28 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   A 40-year-old Bosnian man, who came here as a refugee just a few
months ago and was one of the few striking workers who would not
give his name, said: ``I know what is hard work. Here, they treat
you like a dog. If you get hurt they give you pills and they say,
`What, you can't handle it?'''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for IBP at its corporate headquarters in Dakota
Dunes, S.D., Don Willoughby, said the workers' complaints about
conditions were ``typical union rhetoric'' used as part of the
bargaining process for higher wages. The company has offered a
$1.57 an hour pay increase over the next 4 1/2 years, to a
plant-wide average of $10.41, with 82 cents per-hour effective
immediately, but the union negotiating committee has rejected the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Willoughby said the company paid scrupulous attention to safety
concerns, though he turned down a reporter's request for a tour of
the plant, which is running on partial operations with about 400
nonstriking workers and supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing against your writing, but our experiences with
members of the news media have been less than satisfactory when
we've given tours,'' he said. ``People like to visualize the cow
out in the pasture and the steak on the plate, but they really
don't want to visualize what goes on in-between.''
</P>
<P>
   The company did make six nonstriking workers available for
interviews, in the presence of a company personnel manager. All
said the plant was safe and the company fair, but none would allow
their names to be used for fear, they said, of union retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, union activity among immigrant workers is nothing
new, especially among immigrants. ``This is almost `The Jungle'
revisited,'' said Harley Shaiken, a labor specialist at the
University of California at Berkeley, referring to Upton Sinclair's
classic expose of abuses in the meat industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the turn of the century, immigrant workers speaking Slavic,
Russian and Polish were at the core of organizing efforts,'' he
said, ``and at the end of the century it's immigrant workers
speaking Spanish, Laotian, Vietnamese.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is already looking for new workers, but many workers
on strike pointed to local economic conditions in predicting they
would prevail with a better contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are they going to replace 1,000 people just like that?''
said 38-year-old Guadalupe Alvarado, a cutter who makes $10.43 an
hour after 14 years at the plant. ``It takes a year to really train
someone. It's not easy to replace us. They know that. They won't
admit it, but they know it.''

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT WILL BE ON FED'S ACTIONS NEXT WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Experts generally agree that the Federal
Reserve will raise its targets for interest rates next week. It's
what comes next that has the stock and bond markets and perhaps
even the central bankers guessing.
</P>
<P>
   Monetary policy makers, led by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, will
meet Tuesday and Wednesday. It's widely expected they will raise
the federal funds rate -- which banks charge each other for
overnight loans of banking reserves -- to 5 percent from 4.75
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The move would deliver on the Fed's warning in May that it had
taken a ``bias'' toward tightening policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feeling is that a quarter-point (increase) is as close to
a certainty as you get in this business,'' said Ethan Harris,
senior economist at Lehman Brothers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Credit markets already have pushed up interest rates on home
mortgages, car loans, business credit and the like. Savers, too,
have seen higher rates on bank deposits and money-market mutual
funds.
</P>
<P>
   By following suit and raising its benchmark fed funds rate, the
Fed hopes to tap the brakes on the fast-paced U.S. economy. A
report Friday showed the economy grew at a 4.3 percent pace in the
first quarter this year, faster than government estimates just a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's concern is that continued rapid economic growth
could rekindle inflation.
</P>
<P>
   That's a sharp reversal from just nine months ago, when the Fed
quickly cut the fed funds rate three times to prevent economic
panic in Russia and Latin America from reaching the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's three rate cuts last fall quickly restored confidence
to badly shaken stock and bond markets. The booming U.S. economy
hardly skipped a beat.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise has been that inflation has continued to decline
despite the economy's 4 percent growth rate in each of the last
three years and the unemployment rate's dip to 4.2 percent. With
joblessness still dropping and the economy still cooking,
policy-makers would have expected to see rising inflation long ago.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no sign that inflation is heating up now.
</P>
<P>
   This apparent breakdown in economic trade-offs has Fed
policy-makers ``flying by the seat of their pants these days,''
Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're trying to sort all that out,'' added Mark
Eveans, chief investment officer at Eveans, Bash, Magrino &AMP; Klein
Inc. in Overland Park, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before Congress last week, Greenspan laid out his
scenario in which inflation could become a problem.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that two points of the economy's four percentage
points of growth in the last three years had come from rising
productivity. He said an additional one point had come from the 1
percent growth in population.
</P>
<P>
   The final percentage point in growth, Greenspan said, has come
from the ever-dwindling pool of the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said Greenspan's prescription is to slow economic growth
to 3 percent as his ``pre-emptive strike'' against renewed
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the much sharper rise in market interest
rates, higher oil prices and the recently sluggish stock market may
have done the Fed's braking for it already.
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence of a slowdown has not shown up in the economic
reports. And that leaves the Fed and others watching to see whether
next week's step toward higher interest rates will need to be
followed by a second step.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they will move (Tuesday) and wait and see,'' said
Murray Weidenbaum, chairman of the Center for the Study of American
Business in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said economists and the Fed will be watching four
economic reports due between now and the Fed's next meeting,
scheduled for late August.
</P>
<P>
   The next monthly unemployment report will be released Friday and
another is due before the Fed's August meeting. In mid-July and
mid-August, retail sales updates will show whether consumers -- the
biggest source of economic growth -- have slowed their spending
habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the Fed has to decide,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meanwhile, Wall Street will have to decide whether next
week's Fed step settles the question.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Eaton, investment strategist at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray,
said the stock market was simply waiting for official word on
interest rates to resume its climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the stock market wants to see that Alan Greenspan is
still watching inflation,'' Eaton said. ``I think we'll see a nice
rally and see some new highs.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are less confident.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Jones, a portfolio manager at Mitchell Capital Management
in Kansas City, Mo., said the stock market was prepared for one
step higher by the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if there's any indication of a second or third leg (to Fed
tightening) I'm not sure market valuations can stand it,'' Jones
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he wouldn't turn bearish on stocks if the Fed raised
rates again this summer, but he'd tell clients to postpone
additional stock purchases because they would likely see even lower
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know for sure,'' Eveans said. ``You're always
analyzing on the fly and making your best guess.''

 ON SOAP OPERA'S LAST DAY, FANS GATHER TO COMMISERATE  (mk) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At first, Donna Evers just wanted to have a quiet
lunch so she could mourn with friends as she said goodbye forever
to the people she had loved so long.
</P>
<P>
   But after she posted an invitation on the Internet, the lunch
took on a life of its own. Friday at 1 p.m., more than 100 ardent _
even loving _ fans crammed into the back room at Blondie's
Restaurant on the Upper West Side for the final episode of
``Another World,'' which was the top-rated soap opera in the 1970s
but was being canceled by NBC after 35 years and 8,891 episodes.
</P>
<P>
   The Blondie's goodbye lunch was probably the largest gathering
of fans, but there were other send-offs, too. The waitresses at the
JRS Diner in Brooklyn, across the street from the NBC studio where
the show was filmed for years, dabbed their eyes when Cass
exchanged vows with Lila _ although a few of those tears may have
been shed over the loss of the soap opera's 200 employees,
including several good tippers.
</P>
<P>
   And millions of viewers around the country and Canada were
watching, despite their anger at NBC, and probably could not help
but laugh when a gorilla appeared at the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obsessed,'' said Tammy Casanova, 33, a waitress at a
``little greasy spoon'' in Pinebush, N.Y. ``This is like losing
family.'' Ms. Casanova had driven down to Blondie's, on West 79th
Street, for the day with a friend, Kathy Davis, a manicurist in
Pinebush, and Vanessa, Ms. Casanova's 13-year-old daughter, who
would go straight home after school every day to catch the last 20
minutes of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting across from Ms. Casanova, Priscilla, a lawyer who just
passed the bar exam and was taking a very long lunch, said, ``I
can't lose this job, but I couldn't stay away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll understand,'' Ms. Davis said soothingly. ``This is a
one-time thing. It's important.''
</P>
<P>
   In a back room at Blondie's were the actors and actresses of
``Another World,'' unmistakable with their crisp make-up, high
cheekbones and slim physiques. Some had already found new jobs,
some were still looking. A few were taking themselves and their
characters onto ``As the World Turns,'' and ``Guiding Light,'' the
last two soap operas produced by Proctor &AMP; Gamble Productions for
CBS.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the lunch at Blondie's was both a cast party and a way
to help ease the fans' pain, to help them fight off the emptiness
that would surely confront them at 1 p.m. on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans have endured and we're here to share their sadness,''
said Linda Dano, who played the very rich Felicia for 17 years.
``We hope they will find a place for them to go to be happy, to get
over their sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   And where might that be?
</P>
<P>
   ``Lisa would say CBS,'' she said, referring to Lisa Peluso and
her new job on ``As the World Turns.'' ``I would say ABC,'' said
Ms. Dano, who has found work on ``One Life to Live.'' Since the
shows are broadcast at the same time, a smiling Ms. Peluso
suggested: ``Tape one and watch the other. And if you have a
Nielson box, shake it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors and fans alike agreed that NBC had made a serious, almost
immoral mistake in canceling the show. The problem, many fans said,
was that ``Another World'' was too good, artistically and ethically
_ too well-written and decent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about normal-life people,'' said Lisa Pauley, 29, who
was visiting New York with her husband, Bill, a minister of music
and senior activities at Beachland Baptist Church in Louisville,
Ky. ``The characters had normal problems _ weight problems, drug
addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Pauley, who would get the latest details on the show at dinner
every night, described some of the story lines: ``There was the one
when Brian died. His brother, the mayor, killed him. But he came
back when his fiancee was in trouble to defend her when she was
about to get killed, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The clamor in the crowded room at Blondie's quieted when the
show was on the air. They watched as the characters turned directly
into the camera, ostensibly speaking to the newly married Cass and
Lila, but really seeming to be talking to the viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``May the road rise up to meet you,'' said Sergei, the Russian
chauffeur, reciting the well-known Irish blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans seemed to have trouble remembering that the characters
on the screen were not, well, real.
</P>
<P>
   Toni, who was moving to Tampa, Fla., to be a police captain,
looked at the camera and said, ``If you're ever in Florida, come
visit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm coming!'' cried Ms. Casanova, her cheeks wet.
</P>
<P>
   And when a young lawyer was being congratulated on being
appointed a judge _ one of dozens of plot line strands neatly tied
up _ Priscilla, who had just passed the bar, cried: ``That's
ridiculous! He's not ready to be a judge! We graduated at the same
time!''
</P>
<P>
   When the last scene rolled around _ Felicia lightly touching
dozens of framed photos of the show's actors _ the sobs were
audible. Pauley, his face grim, put his arm around his wife, who
clenched a tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Morely, 38, a computer programmer from Portchester, N.Y.,
said she had been watching for 28 years with her mother and
grandmother. ``It's a part of how I am,'' she said. ``I talked to
my Mom about it all the time on the phone. I'm worried now. What am
I going to have to talk with her about?''
</P>
<P>
   The show's head writer, Leah Laiman, gave assurances about the
characters' futures. ``We want you to know that these characters
will love happily ever after,'' she said at Blondie's. Pushing her
power a bit, she concluded, ``And so will you.''

FORT WORTH POLICE EXPAND INVESTIGATION OF HOGTYING FATALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KATHY SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The internal inquiry into the death of a man
who was hogtied in police custody has been expanded to include
detectives who, by ``intentional action or negligence,'' ignored
crucial elements of the investigation, Police Chief Thomas Windham
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Internal affairs investigators also will question supervisors
and officers who sat on pre-disciplinary panels that exonerated two
of the five officers who were later fired because the case, Windham
said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief said Thursday that the five officers used excessive
force in the arrest that led to the death of Luis Enrique
Hernandez, 31, then lied to cover up their actions. Windham has
asked state and federal officials to look into criminal charges or
the possibility of civil rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   The internal investigation, he said, will focus on why evidence
that Hernandez had been hogtied was ignored, discounted or
disregarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm most disappointed in the investigation and the review of
this situation,'' Windham said at a morning news conference. ``It
was put in place to get to the facts. ... Because of intentional
actions or negligence, the review process did not reveal the facts
of this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The fired officers, all of whom have appealed their dismissals,
are David N. Stefanos, 30, an eight-year veteran; David P. Alkins,
27, commissioned in October 1995; Linn William Goodman, 27, an
officer for slightly more than a year; Hector Luis Melendez, 28,
also with a year on the job; and John R. ``John-John'' Ornelas, 25,
an officer since December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Gilliland, a Police Explorer Post Scout and police
academy applicant who was with the officers, was also accused by
Windham of participating in the cover-up and lying to
investigators. His application has been rejected by the academy.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, attorneys for the fired officers blamed poor
training and supervision and accused Windham of portraying events
in the worst light.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded inquiry will examine the actions of former Lt.
Alice Adams, who supervised the investigation until her retirement
in April, and major case unit Detectives .MDNM/I.V. Haley, the lead
investigator, and Vic Fowler.MDNM/ and James Desmarais..MDNM/
</P>
<P>
   Adams, contacted at her home, said ``it would be inappropriate
at this time'' to comment on the Hernandez case or Windham's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Desmarais also declined to comment. Fowler and Haley could not
be reached.
</P>
<P>
   City officials expressed support for Windham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the actions of the chief send a message loud and
clear,'' Assistant City Manager Libby Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Chuck Silcox, a frequent critic of Windham,
said, ``I think he has shown that he is on top of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney David Sloane, who represents Goodman, said he believes
that the five fired officers are scapegoats for what he described
as inappropriate training and supervision in the use of leg
restraints and hogtying.
</P>
<P>
   The department's rules, regulations and policies ban any form of
hogtying, but the officers' attorneys said the orders contain no
definition of the prohibited restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Terry Daffron Hickey of the Combined Law Enforcement
Associations of Texas, which is providing attorneys for the
dismissed officers, said Windham painted the ``worst possible case
against the officers, whether accurate or not. The letters (of
dismissal) only contain alleged violations of department general
orders and do not allege any criminal wrongdoing by the officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Many departments banned hogtying after national studies showed
that the practice could cause or contribute to death.
</P>
<P>
   Windham and other officers described the procedure Friday as
handcuffing a person behind the back, restraining the ankles, then
binding the ankles to the handcuffs, leaving the victim in a
bow-shaped position.
</P>
<P>
   MedStar ambulance attendants and paramedics said they found
Hernandez in that position when they arrived at his home in the
3200 block of Hale Avenue about 2:30 p.m. on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Police responded that day to a report that Hernandez had struck
a child. They scuffled with him, then handcuffed and hogtied him to
restrain him, witnesses said. Hernandez became motionless and
unconscious and was left lying in the street, Windham said.
</P>
<P>
   MedStar attendants ordered officers to release the hog-tie so
they could treat Hernandez, Windham said in dismissal letters sent
to the city's Civil Service Commission. Hernandez died a short time
later.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy concluded that he died of sudden cardiac death and
aspiration of gastric contents. After learning of the hogtying,
Medical Examiner Nizam Peerwani said he will review his report and
issue a final ruling on the death next week.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors who saw Hernandez scuffle with police told
investigators and reporters at the scene that they had seen
Hernandez hogtied. The officers involved, Windham said, repeatedly
denied that anyone used the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Windham said Gilliland, the Explorer Post Scout, subsequently
told investigators that after Hernandez died, he was drawn into a
circle of officers and admonished not to mention the hog-tie.
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening, while driving to downtown headquarters to
give statements, Ornelas again told Gilliland not to reveal
anything about officers using the hog-tie, Windham said.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing those statements and reviewing the case, Windham
said he determined that the officers had lied, either outright or
by omission, about their handling of Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   After Hernandez died, major case unit detectives conducted the
investigation into what the department calls a crucial police case.
Their work, however, was poor, Windham said. Many witnesses who
said they had seen the victim hogtied were never interviewed again,
the chief said.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the results of such an investigation are forwarded to
the supervisors of the involved officers. The results and the
supervisors' recommendations are sent to a pre-disciplinary review
board, which usually includes three captains, a lieutenant and a
peer of the officer.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the incomplete investigation, Windham said, the
review boards for Stefanos and Alkins were given flawed
information, and the boards did not sustain the allegations of
excessive force. The review board's recommendations were sent to
the chief in May.
</P>
<P>
   Windham said it became obvious that Hernandez had been hogtied
and that the officers weren't telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I then asked internal affairs to conduct a supplemental
investigation,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Windham U.S. Attorney Paul Coggins this week to investigate the
possibility that Hernandez's civil rights were violated. He will
forward a criminal case to the district attorney's office for
consideration of state charges, such as voluntary manslaughter or
negligent homicide, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have a serious allegation of civil rights
violations, it will be treated seriously by our office and the
FBI,'' Coggins said. ``When the chief of police calls, we take it
just as seriously, if not more seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Coggins said he cannot recall any prior civil rights
investigation involving Fort Worth police.  &QL;

MONKS CELEBRATE OPENING OF LARGEST THAI BUDDHIST TEMPLE IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN IWASAKI  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For a handful of Thai Buddhist monks living near a
tranquil pond between Auburn and Federal Way, a double-wide mobile
home served as their ``temporary'' temple for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now only their address remains the same. On Saturday, the monks
will celebrate the opening of their new house of worship, a
47,000-square-foot structure that is the largest Thai Buddhist
temple in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very happy,'' Phra Amaramuni, the abbott of Washington
Buddhavanaram Buddhist Temple, said while sitting inside a vast
hall anchored by a 9-foot-tall brass Buddha covered with gold leaf.
``Everybody's happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred worshipers, some from overseas and across the
nation, are expected at Saturday's opening and Sunday's services on
the 7-acre site. Among them are 100 monks here for an annual
conference of the Dhammayut Order in the United States, of which
Amaramuni serves as president.
</P>
<P>
   Construction on the $2.7 million project started seven years ago
and proceeded as money was available. Many of the donations came in
small denominations from Buddhists locally and in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, the bulk of construction was accomplished by a tiny
crew, just ``three men and a forklift,'' said Boonling Rosehom, a
monk wearing a mustard-colored robe.
</P>
<P>
   The temple counts between 100 and 200 members in the Seattle
area, most of Thai ancestry but also from Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar,
Sri Lanka, Tibet, Vietnam and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's open for everybody, not just Buddhists,'' Amaramuni said
of the temple at 4401 S. 360th St., in southern King County, which
he said eclipses the size of Thai Buddhist structures in California
and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the temple will convert the lower level of the
building into a meditation center, library and classrooms and offer
teachings about Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   The monks practice the Theravada school of Buddhism, in which
devotees make offerings to an image of Buddha to gain karmic merit
and to be reminded of the Buddha's virtues.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the temple culminates a 17-year effort that began
when Buddhist monks arrived from Thailand in 1982 at the request of
the local Thai community and rented a house in Federal Way that
doubled as a temple. In 1984, temple members bought their current
property and assembled a prefabricated structure.
</P>
<P>
   The new temple is not only for the here and now, Rosehom said.
</P>
<P>
   Suspended around the perimeter in precise locations are nine
200-pound granite balls serving as boundary markers. Each ball
symbolizes a different blessing, such as long life and happiness.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's ceremony, the woody vines holding the balls will
be severed and the spheres will be buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1,000 years, the building will be gone but the stones will
still be underground,'' Rosehom said. ``If you can find one, you
can find all the others. ... It means you're successful in building
the temple.''
</P>
<P>
   While still above ground, worshipers rub patches of gold leaf on
the 15-inch-diameter balls and cover them with coins. Some scribble
wishes on scraps of paper and drop them into 4-foot holes beneath
the balls.
</P>
<P>
   Also tossed in are pencils (representing memory, since they're
used to write information) and gold or silver needles (representing
a sharp mind or wisdom), Rosehom said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, worshipers knelt before Amaramuni and presented cloth
pouches filled with coins, dollar bills, needles, thread, locks of
hair and fingernail clippings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're giving yourself to the temple, so in the next life
you'll be better,'' said one worshiper, explaining the contents of
the offerings. Once the bills are removed _ the temple still has
expenses to pay _ the pouches will be placed in the holes.
</P>
<P>
   The granite balls are symbolic of a mind ``heavy like a stone,''
where confusion is pushed out, Rosehom said.

O'NEAL WON'T OPT OUT OF CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Lakers' greatest offseason
transaction will be the one that didn't happen. Shaquille O'Neal
has decided not to become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone expected otherwise. But he made it official
Friday _ which was the deadline for that decision _ when his agent
announced O'Neal would not exercise an option to terminate the last
four years of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaquille has decided to remain with the Lakers,'' Leonard
Armato said in a statement. ``He is excited about the Lakers'
prospects for the future and is looking forward to playing for new
coach Phil Jackson.''
</P>
<P>
   Armato declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Upset over the Lakers' third straight postseason collapse and
frustrated by teammate Kobe Bryant and coach Kurt Rambis, O'Neal
made noise about opting out of his contract, though it never seemed
likely. The hiring of Jackson wiped out any lingering doubt.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal had millions of reasons to stay. His seven-year
contract has four years and $81million remaining, starting with
$17million next season. If he signed with another team, NBA rules
would set O'Neal's starting salary at $11million.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, O'Neal could have opted out in order to sign a
new long-term deal _ up to seven years and $151 million _ with the
Lakers, but that too would have involved a slight pay cut
initially.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a personal standpoint, I can't tell you how excited I
am,'' Lakers executive vice president Jerry West said of O'Neal's
decision. ``He has yet to get completely to the top of his game. He
just has so much room to improve. And the bottom line is he's a
good guy and he wants to win, and that's why he gets frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   But not frustrated enough to bail out on one of the NBA's
premier franchises, which just signed one of the league's premier
coaches to a five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hired the coach with the best credentials that was there,
and someone who has a wonderful way of working with people,'' West
said. ``More importantly, I think it gives us something that from
my perspective is a very stable situation, and I think that's what
Shaquille wants.''
</P>
<P>
   The next personnel decisions will come from the front office.
Jackson will return to L.A. this weekend and will meet with West
and general manager Mitch Kupchak to discuss the coaching staff and
the roster _ including the status of Glen Rice.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are already negotiating with former Bulls assistant
coaches Jim Cleamons and Jimmy Rodgers to rejoin Jackson, and
Chicago assistant Tex Winter is a strong possibility as well.
Lakers coaches Kurt Rambis, Bill Bertka and Larry Drew are expected
to meet with Jackson, but it appears there will be little or no
room on his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Rice could become a free agent July 1 unless the Lakers exercise
a one-year, $7.1million option by June 30. All indications are that
they will, though Rice has made it clear he wants a new multiyear
contract with a starting salary closer to the $14 million maximum.
</P>
<P>
   West said no decision had been made and that Jackson's input
will weigh heavily.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're I think leaning very heavily toward keeping the same
team we have,'' he said. ``Phil Jackson is coming to town, and we
basically try to do what our coaches want us to do, and get them
the personnel they want.''

COLUMN: VIRTUE'S NICE, BUT A REWARD IS MORE HELP
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   His admirers say that Eric has concerns about the publicity, and
understandably so. After living on the streets for so long, he does
not want to risk disrupting the peace of his home. Besides, there
are people in prison because of him; no sense in giving them ideas.
</P>
<P>
   So with all due respect, Eric declined to talk about himself.
But his silence does not mute the rare charm of his story. And we
all should know when one of the good guys finally wins.
</P>
<P>
   At first, charm was nowhere to be found. On a March afternoon in
1996, three men burst into a jewelry store in downtown Brooklyn,
flashing guns to clarify their intentions. They made off with
$1,500 and a collection of rings and bracelets, all gold.
</P>
<P>
   When the police began chasing them down Fulton Street, the
bandits opened fire. Although no bullet found its uniformed mark,
the gunmen managed to disappear in the confusing cloud of violence.
</P>
<P>
   A block away, Eric was at his usual station, panhandling. The
homeless are often invisible to society at large; on this day, Eric
was invisible to three men in particular. They scrambled past him,
hustled into a waiting car and sped away.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen and their driver should not have taken Eric for
granted. He may have been begging on the street, but he is
intelligent and proud; grounded, you might say. When the police
arrived, he asked whether they were looking for three men in a
hurry. As a matter of fact, they were.
</P>
<P>
   Eric volunteered the make and license plate of the getaway car,
as well as which way it went. He then climbed into a patrol car and
joined the hunt for the men who had fired at officers of the peace.
</P>
<P>
   The police soon came upon the abandoned car. Its occupants had
bolted in different directions, judging by the trail of stolen
valuables left in their wake. But no matter where they hid _
whether in that closet on Pacific or in that backyard on Clinton _
the three gunmen and their driver were found and arrested at
gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Eric's work was not done. He testified before the grand jury
that indicted the men, and repeatedly offered his services to Hilda
Mortensen, a prosecutor in the office of Brooklyn District Attorney
Charles Hynes. ``He told me I could generally find him on a corner
on Montague Street,'' Ms. Mortensen said.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the value of Eric's assistance, Ms. Mortensen and
Kevin Gallagher, a Brooklyn detective, recommended to the Police
Department that he receive a $10,000 reward from a nonprofit
organization that sponsors a program called COPSHOT. After all, Ms.
Mortensen said, ``I wouldn't have been able to get any convictions
because without his help, no one would have been arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Police Department decided that Eric's case did not
qualify for any reward, a spokesman said this week, because ``it
was determined at that time that it did not fit the criteria.'' The
primary criterion cited by the spokesman was that the information
leading to the capture of someone who shoots at an officer ``must
be made through a phone call.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Eric was being penalized for relaying his
crucial information in person and in the heat of the moment. His
case for a reward, it seems, would have been strengthened had he
left the scene, used one of the quarters he had bummed, and dialed
1-800-COPSHOT.
</P>
<P>
   The unfairness in this finest of technicalities bothered Eric,
and he began to lobby hard for reconsideration. ``He wouldn't let
go,'' Ms. Mortensen said. ``He was a very determined individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years passed, and lives evolved. The four bandits drew
closer to parole. Ms. Mortensen took a maternity leave. Eric found
a place to live and a job to keep. But he kept fighting for that
reward.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Gallagher asked his superiors to reconsider
Eric's case. This time, for reasons that remain unclear, the Police
Department recommended to COPSHOT's board of directors that a
reward be granted to the man who had helped find four gunmen so
long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Mangione, the spokesman for COPSHOT, said that the board
recently found the case clear-cut. ``The information led to the
arrest and the conviction of the suspects'' who had shot at
officers, he said. ``And that is why the board of directors _
despite his not calling the hot line _ thought he warranted
receiving that reward.''
</P>
<P>
   With money and justice in hand, Eric has moved on. But he has
that worry about publicity. And so he will remain just Eric.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- When Eldon Lawless got up Friday morning, it
looked as if it would be a hot, sunny day in south-central Kansas.
Lawless liked the heat steaming out of the ground. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But by 8 a.m., when the bank vice president and farmer reached
his office in Wellington, it had turned hazy. The sky offered less
promise of drying out the 1,000 sodden acres of wheat that Lawless
is anxious to get harvested. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you quickly what's happening with the wheat harvest
here. Nothing,'' said Lawless, chairman of the Kansas Wheat
Commission, which pays for wheat research and marketing for the
state's most noted crop. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lawless farms in Sumner County on the Kansas border with
Oklahoma, directly south of Wichita. Sumner generally produces more
winter wheat than any other county in the state. This year promised
to be another good one before rain and hail storms damaged crops
and made the ground too mucky for combine crews to get into fields.
The area got 3 1/2 inches of rain Thursday, which followed at least
an inch a few days before, Lawless said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The longer the wheat has to stand in the fields, the greater the
chance of deterioration. That translates into fewer bushels per
acre and lower quality. And that means lower returns at a time when
wheat prices, at about $2.40 a bushel, are running well below the
cost of production. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the weather has raised red flags at Kansas City,
Mo., Interstate Bakeries, the country's largest wholesale
bread-baking company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned from a quality perspective,'' said Mark
Dirkes, spokesman for Interstate. ``People say the weather this
year is very similar to the weather in 1993, lots and lots of rain
before harvest. In 1993, the most common consumer complaint we
received was people asking, `What have you done with my bread? It
is dry and crumbly.' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Processing tolerances were so low that year if you mixed your
dough a little too much the bread was dry and crumbly. If you
didn't mix it quite enough, it was dry and crumbly.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas hard red winter wheat harvest began two weeks ago in
southern areas, the typical starting point, but has since virtually
stopped, said Sherri Hand, agricultural statistician with the
Kansas Department of Agriculture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hard red winter wheat harvest is 2 percent complete. That
compares with 31 percent a year ago and the five-year average of 16
percent. Meanwhile, 55 percent of the crop is ripe, well behind
last year's level of 77 percent, but ahead of the overall average
of 46 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rain delays and other storm damage to plants in many fields
have caused Kansas agriculture officials to reduce their
projections for this year's yield. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Total Kansas hard red winter wheat production now is estimated
to be 395.6 million bushels, down from the May 1 estimate of 408.5
million. That compares with last year's total of 494.9 million
bushels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Hailstorms either wiped out crops or reduced yields, and many
farmers are plowing the crop under and planting other crops,'' said
Hand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the rain has made it hard to plant other crops. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the toughest harvest seasons we've faced in a long
time,'' said Kansas farmer Patty Clark, who is director of the
public policy division of the Kansas Farm Bureau in Manhattan.
``We've had nothing but rain since April 1.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains, compounded by high winds, have forced many wheat
plants to ``wrap'' themselves and lay flat, said Clark, whose
family farms wheat, corn, soybeans and cotton in southeast Kansas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When conditions finally allow you to get in the field, it's
doubly hard to harvest,'' she said. ``There is not as clean a
product coming out of the combine. You take all that's going on
with the harvest combined with already low prices and a lot of
farmers are edgy, and rightly so.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Farm Bureau reported that prices farmers are getting are
running from $2.19 to $2.62 a bushel. That's far below what it
costs to produce a bushel of wheat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Farm Bureau economist Mark Nelson said variable costs this year
for fuel, seed and fertilizer were running about $78 an acre. When
added to fixed expenses of about $45 an acre, it is costing farmers
about $125 to produce an acre of wheat. Divide that amount by how
many bushels per acre a farmer reaps, and you come up with what a
farmer should get per bushel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, a farmer who gets 40 bushels an acre would have to
get about $3.13 per bushel to cover production costs. A farmer
getting only 30 bushels per acre would need $4.16 a bushel to cover
production costs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those prices don't cover the cost of the farmer's labor or
include any profit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each day that farmers can't get into their fields to harvest
wheat or plant fall crops means a day in which yields probably will
fall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For planting, Clark said, the window each day is getting
narrower and narrower, and could mean a reduction in yield. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Farming is a very intricate and complicated industry that
deals with a tremendous amount of variables,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, even as the rain delays harvest of the winter wheat
and the planting of some fall crops -- for the fall crops that have
managed to get planted -- a farmer worries that the chemicals used
on weeds could be too diluted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are sitting on pins and needles, and each day
those pins and needles are getting a little sharper,'' Clark said. &QL;

OFFICER'S INTENT DEBATED IN SHOOTING OF SQUEEGEE MAN
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ A day after a police officer testified that fear led
him to shoot an unarmed squeegee man at a Bronx intersection,
prosecutors and defense lawyers battled over the reality of that
fear while the judge in the case tried to pinpoint the officer's
intentions before he fired the shot.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Michael Meyer, charged with attempted murder and being
tried before a judge in state Supreme Court at the Bronx County
Courthouse, has testified that he got out of his car at a ramp of
the Major Deegan Expressway near Yankee Stadium on June 14, 1998,
because the squeegee man, Antoine Reid, refused to step away after
giving his front windshield an unwanted wash. He has also testified
that he shot Reid in the chest after pushing him and engaging in a
momentary but violent struggle that he thought he might lose.
</P>
<P>
   But when Meyer took the stand Friday, he was met by several
questions from Acting Justice John Collins, who wanted the officer
to explain, among other things, what he intended to accomplish by
getting out of his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it your intention to arrest him?'' the judge asked. To
this, the officer replied that he ``just wanted him to get away
from the car,'' adding that the man was looming outside his window
and would not stop cursing in front of his fiancee's 6-year-old
son.
</P>
<P>
   He said Reid seemed ``unpredictable'' as to ``what he would
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark DeMarco, an assistant district attorney, tried to reverse
the characterization and portray the officer as the unpredictable
one, a man whose natural inclination was to get out and confront
Reid. The prosecutor questioned whether Meyer had followed correct
police procedure by getting out of his car and firing a shot on an
exit ramp that was crowded with cars.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, off duty at the time of the shooting, did not directly
acknowledge whether he had acted according to proper procedures. He
said his decision to get out of his car was based on ``natural
instinct.'' The only thing on his mind before firing the shot, he
said, was that he was faced with an emotionally disturbed man ``who
could do serious damage to me, possibly kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   After a barrage of questions by the prosecution, Meyer's lawyer,
Murray Richman, sought to portray the officer's record in the
Police Department as one of restraint. Meyer said that he had fired
his weapon only once during more than 200 arrests over a nine-year
career on the force. According to the Police Department, most New
York City police officers serve their entire careers without ever
firing their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Before closing the trial for the day, Collins allowed the
defense to present a surprise witness, a lawyer named Thaddeus
Mcguire, who testified that he had been menaced by Reid in April
1998, in an encounter that so frightened him that he ran a red
light.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution challenged the witness, asking him whether he
saw the squeegee man in the court. Mcguire immediately pointed to a
young black man sitting about three rows back. But Reid was not in
the courtroom; Mcguire had pointed to Reid's brother.
</P>
<P>
   DeMarco rested his case after pointing out the misidentification
for the record. Meyer's defense team later said the two brothers
looked alike and called the prosecutor's move ``dirty pool.''
